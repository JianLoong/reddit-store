I basically compromised and agreed living near his work so it's convenient for him assuming it's short term (~1 year). For me however it's a nightmare of sitting in 30-40 mins traffic everyday which I'm not used to at all. \n\nNow he's closer to his friends, colleagues, 5 min walk to his work and everything else. So when we first moved in he started bringing his colleagues over to have lunch in our house since it's only 5 mins away. At first he didn't even tell me but as I started noticing dishes and other things he'd tell only if I asked if there was anyone else home that day. \n\nEventually after many fights he started telling me while they're home instead of me finding out later. Now his friends and colleagues, I know most of them, I have met them etc. I have extreme anxiety when it comes to cleaning, thinking other people judging etc. So I tried to get over it slowly being ok with him just casually texting me at work that his friends are having lunch at our house. \n\nToday I had to wake up super early (5:45am) for work and I was racing all day to finish my work early so I can go home early. Maybe take a nap (because I was very tired) to make up for lack of sleep. I got done with work by 3 and I took a minute to sit down and do some computer stuff along with other things I've been putting away. \n\nI was done by 3:40pm I used the washroom and started walking towards the parking lot. I got a text from him just as I was about to reach the car that there's someone (stranger to me) at our house for the next 1.5 hours. I was immediately heartbroken and crushed with mixed emotions \n\nI can't go and take a nap with someone in the  house neither can he talk to his friend in peace while I'm in house. The thought of meeting someone new after a long day gave me crippling anxiety and the thought of waiting in car for them to leave just made me sad.\n\nSo I went back up to my office and spent the next 1.5 hours there just to make sure that person definitely leaves before I go home. \n\nIs it wrong to expect he tells me before inviting someone home ? I could've told him do it another place or day and that I'm coming home early. But he did not tell me nor does he ever tell me before he brings some one home \n\nIf I say something he says \"I don't have freedom I have to ask permission for everything, I can't read your mind when you're gonna come home etc\" \n\nI tried talking to him and he boiled everything down to my fault for not telling him I was going home early. Also that I'm trying to control him. \n\nTLDR: Husband thinks I'm controlling him because I ask him to tell me beforehand if someone is going to be in our house.", "created_utc": 1696051058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vybnj/aita_for_telling_my_28f_husband_29m_he_should/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel this one in my soul, OP. I really do. My social butterfly husband always used to do this to me. Not so much nowadays- I\u2019m afraid my autoimmune disease has gotten so bad, I just can\u2019t keep the house at the level where I\u2019m comfortable having surprise company, and it reached a point where we had a come to Jesus about it. Either HE keeps the house immaculate, or no surprise guests. Since he doesn\u2019t want to clean, that\u2019s that. I get ample warning now, and he always asks my permission, and respects when I can\u2019t physically entertain. \n\nBUT maybe there\u2019s a compromise here.

It takes hardly any effort to give you a heads up.", "My partner and I had this same issue when we first moved in and I relate to your story so so much! \n\nHe has to understand that as a shared space you have the right to know who is coming and when if that\u2019s what makes you comfortable. Your home should be your sanctuary and safe space. \n\nMaybe suggest specific days or times where NOT having guests over is non-negotiable?

This has also been an issue with me and my husband. He finishes work earlier than me and has a lot of friends in the neighborhood. I work a high stress job, often finish late and often like to just relax when I get home. He comes from a culture where the home is basically always full of random family and friends and I come from a culture where the home is a private place. As a compromise we now have a system where some of his friends have a \u201cgreen card\u201d to come and go as they like. These are typically close friends who I\u2019ve met many times and don\u2019t really care anymore if they see me/my house in its natural state.

It sounds like he has people over a lot.  The only compromise he's given you is texting you a heads up that he's bringing people that day.

My spouse and I typically plan visitors at least a day or two in advance and only occasionally bring someone in without advance warning. \n\nFrankly it sounds like you're really the one making all the compromises.

Perhaps you can schedule days when he is allowed to have guests over and private days. \n\nWhy can't you take a nap when he has friends over? They are there to visit him, so you do not have to socialize with them. You should not have to stay away from home just because he is entertaining.", "NTA.
