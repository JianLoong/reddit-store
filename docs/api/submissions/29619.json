My husband used his money for a down payment on a house that she would live in and he charged her $1000 a month for the past 14 years.\n\nWe have been together for 12, married for 9.  We\u2019ve paid $200 a month to cover costs not covered by her $1000.  Plus we\u2019ve paid for all the repairs. She is on title for the house for 1% so she had security of being on title and my husband and I own the remaining 99%.\n\nWe have decided to sell the house.  My husband offered for her to buy it way under market value and she said no. So he\u2019s offered to split the profit with her.  It will end up being $120-150k in her pocket when all is said and done.\n\nShe treats my husband like shit, ignores me, doesn\u2019t ask about our kids or know their birthdates.  She\u2019s not interested in any part of our lives.  She\u2019s now telling family my husband is somehow taking advantage of her and he\u2019s the bad guy.\n\nShe was a shitty cold mom and with the way her and his step dad treated my husband he moved out at 14 and lived with his bio dad.\n\nShe lives about 3 hrs away and my husband made two trips there before listing to fix things that needed repair.  The yard was no kept nicely (MIL is late 50s but in decent shape, and my 31 yr old BIL lives there) we replaced the roof, repainted, he took all their junk they didn\u2019t want to the dump.  The whole time he was there she treated him like crap, was negative to him and even had a friend over and didn\u2019t introduce him.\n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to give her anything? I know she will need it, and if she was even a little bit pleasant I could feel good about it.  It was an arrangement my husband had before me so I\u2019m going along with his wishes, but I don\u2019t think she deserves anything.   She\u2019s always treated him like crap, doesn\u2019t appreciate how he\u2019s helped her and he\u2019s splitting all the profit even though we\u2019ve paid tons out of pocket.\n\nShe\u2019s always had crappy jobs and just did what she had to with no regard for the future, I guess she just expected my husband to foot the bill for her lifestyle? But not her 3 other sons.  Was it not his step fathers job to make sure she was taken care of?\n\nIf you read this far thanks.", "created_utc": 1698203206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fv6v2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_mil_for_sitting_on/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

HOWEVER, husbands out of pocket expenses/repairs need to be deducted from the profit before MIL is given any money.  And no, she certainly doesn\u2019t deserve half, in my opinion.", "NTA. She gets one percent of the profit and that\u2019s it. Find a good real estate lawyer in the area and put it up for sale.  That money can go to your kids not you MIL and her kids.", "Unfortunately it seems like your husband has already made the deal. Sell it, pay her off and hopefully your husband will go NC with her, or she will be back after she spends all the money. NTA.", "Adding that you need to make sure the deed isn\u2019t the kind that the surviving person gets the house. If something happens to you two make sure it goes to your kids.", "NTA. She certainly doesn\u2019t deserve half. If she doesn\u2019t get this money I see her becoming a larger pain in your ass later on. Possibly trying to move in with you etc\u2026 may be best to buy her off.", "NTA  If you want to be generous, give her 1% of the money when the house is sold.", "You are not the asshole for not wanting to give her or anything.  \n\nBUT it's his money, the arrangement pre-dates you and his relationship, and so long as your husband knows everything that's going on with your MIL, including her trash-talking, and still wants to do it, just let it go and be supportive of him.  He obviously feels some obligation to her, even with the history as your have described.  the best thing you can do is to help him move on after this, that once he gives his money, he has fulfil his filial duties to her, and he shouldn't give her more in the future, unless somehow her behaviors toward your family changes, and you want her to be in your lives again.", "NTA,\n\nno, because my ex-father behaves like your MIL, and treats all of us like crap, now my mom and brothers ignore him 100% and not giving him anything as payback.", "NTA. Nothing is owed to her or your BIL and you have done miles more than you should have already. Help your husband stand up for himself against her and cut her out of your life", ">It was an arrangement my husband had before me so I\u2019m going along with his wishes\n\nDoesn't sound like there's any conflict here. You can have your feelings about it.", "NTA. If she's such a horrible and uninvolved mom and grandmother I am not sure why you have even been helping her out financially for the past 14 years. She should ask the 31 year old son who lives with her for financial support. Definitely do not give his woman half your money. She would not do the same for you. Keep the money and invest in it for your children. Your MIL and your BIL are adults they can support themselves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are right, she doesn\u2019t deserve even half, judging by your description.  It is nice that your husband is generous and feels like he should look out for his mom.  Maybe don\u2019t give her any money at all.  \n\nFind a suitable house you can buy but work a deal to rent it until you can pay the mortgage off after you sell the house she is living in.  \n\nDon\u2019t ask her opinion, don\u2019t take her shopping, don\u2019t tell her until the house is rented.  Then tell her she has to move into the new house like it or not.  Then when the first house sells pay off the mortgage on the rental and keep the difference to make up for the past expenses of her not taking care of the property until the mortgage is paid off and then he can gift the house to her later.  He has done the honorable thing by providing a house for his mother that she doesn\u2019t have to pay any payment or rent.  She will be responsible for everything for the house from then on.  He has already been generous for so long this would be a way for him to provide without financially subsidizing more people than just his mother.", "NTA- give her 1% of the sale price less expenses including costs of all the work and travel before the sale of the property\u2026 and hopefully never talk to her again\u2026", "NTA, she legally is only entitled to 1% of the profits. I get your frustration, it feels like your husband is doing this out of obligation, and a sense of duty (common with military men and women), not love or a thank you to his mom for being a good mother.  It hard to understand why people feel an obligation to those that have not treated them well, but unfortunately many people can\u2019t ignore that sense of duty. \n\nI think you have to allow it without kicking up a fuse for your husband sake. It sounds like you will not be struggling financially due to his choice, but I think you husband would be struggling emotionally if he didn\u2019t share the profits. Even though his mother seems like not a great human being, she is his mom. It is hard to think of your mom struggling, unless they were an absolutely monsters to you. Yes, she wasn\u2019t a great or even good mom, but you don\u2019t point to serious abuse in your post, so that idea of how one should treat their mom is hard to get past for most people. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think you should try to prevent your husband from sharing what % of the profits makes him feel free of guilt, I would suggest you have a talk with him about how he goes about doing so. You want to ensure she not at your doorstep in a few years having blown through the share your husband is gifting her bc she is homeless or living in a dump bc that is all she can afford. \n\nInstead of a payout he should help her find a place to live and agree to subsidize or pay her rent with that money till the the amount her was going to give her runs out. The reason I say he should be involved in the process of finding the place is not only for his piece of mind that she landed in a safe place, but that the place she chooses is one that the money from the sale will last for what would be a reasonable estimate of her life expectancy, taking into account how much she want to spend of her current 1000 payment each month moving forward towards the new rent.", "I\u2019d try to stop from him giving her money she\u2019s already been a mooch", ">It was an arrangement my husband had before me so I\u2019m going along with his wishes, \n\nThis part is key to whether you get a say, and it's good that you realize it and respect it. I think you should also respect that it's his mom. His feelings about her are complicated and not so cut and dried as yours, so even if you don't think she deserves his kindness, it is his place and not yours to decide how his relationship with her should proceed. \n\nYou are not the AH for how you feel, but you would be the AH if you interfered.", "NTA\n\nHow the hell is she getting $120K-$150K out of a house that she only owns 1% of?  Your husband is letting his mom fleece him.  That money should be going to your children, not his leech of a mother.", "I should clarify the arrangement was for him to purchase the house, for her to pay $1000 a month and for him to pay house ins, taxes and repairs. \n\nThe splitting of the profits of the sale were never part of it.  It\u2019s his response to feeling bad about wanting to sell the house.", "Yes she was always shitty. But he made the choice to purchase the house and we didn\u2019t know she was a shit grandma/not interested in our family until we had one.  We just accepted it and let it be, but with listing the house and having to engage her more her bad attitude is in over drive.", "But you're going along with his wishes to share the profit. Right?", "It wasn't a bad idea to purchase the house. It went up in value so it can be seen as an investment. However, it would be stupid to hand over half the money made to someone who wouldn't do the same for you if positions were reversed. Odds are, she will burn through that money renting/living and come ask you for more while still treating you badly once you establish yourself as her personal piggy bank. She is relatively young. End your financial support now or it will go on for many more years and will be harder to say no in 20 years when she late 70s and retired with no other options.", "Op going along with it but wants to know if she an ah for not wanting to give her anything"]}
