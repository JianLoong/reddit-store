{"id": 11424, "submission_id": "11hqtj1", "title": "AITA for ruining my stepdaughter's surprise because my kids weren't included", "selftext": "My husband and I each have 2 kids. He has Elise (16f) and Logan (12f) and I have Lola (12f) and Luke (9m). Elise was very sick this past year. She wasn't able to go to school and she was in and out of the hospital. She's starting to recover and her doctor cleared her to go back to school part time. \n\nWhen my husband heard that Elise could go back to school, he texted Elise's best friend and her boyfriend. He told them the news and asked them to help him plan a big surprise party for her the day of her appointment. And by help, I mean they plan the whole thing, clear it with him, and he hands over his credit card. These kids had no rules (besides the obvious don't break the law), no budget, and no curfew. They could do whatever they want for this party. \n\nThey planned a very fun party. They rented out the back room of a restaurant Elise likes. Her best friend, boyfriend, and maybe 20 friends will join them. After the restaurant, they rented out a theater at a luxury theater to watch a movie. Then Elise, her boyfriend, best friend, and a couple other kids are going to do an escape room, play laser tag, go go kart racing, and go to the arcade. Basically, do everything she's missed out on over the past year. They have reservations for everything and it's all paid for. I looked at how much all of this costs and it's in the thousands. \n\nThe problem is Lola and Luke are only allowed at dinner and Logan will be picked up after a couple of the activities. I think this is a celebration for all of us and that all of the kids should be included in this party but my husband said no, this party is for Elise and she'd want her friends with her, not her younger siblings. We're not even going to be at the same table as them. I reminded him that Logan will be going to the movies and arcade with them but my kids aren't allowed and he said it's because Elise is closer with Logan than my kids so she'd want Logan there for part of it. \n\nI figured I wasn't going to get anywhere with him so I went to Elise, told her about the party, and asked her to tell her dad to invite her siblings. After the shock from learning about the party wore off, she said she'd rather keep things the way they're planned because it sounds like a lot of fun. \n\nShe mentioned the party to my husband and he is furious that I went to her. He says it's not my place to try to insert my kids into \"her one night out\" and is mad that I \"robbed him of the opportunity to see the surprised look on her face at the party\". He's barely spoken to me since then and I'm starting to wonder if I was the asshole for ruining the surprise.", "created_utc": 1677908169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hqtj1/aita_for_ruining_my_stepdaughters_surprise/", "score": 2155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has Elise (16f) and Logan (12f) and I have Lola (12f) and Luke (9m). Elise was very sick this past year. She wasn't able to go to school and she was in and out of the hospital. She's starting to recover and her doctor cleared her to go back to school part time. \n\nWhen my husband heard that Elise could go back to school, he texted Elise's best friend and her boyfriend. He told them the news and asked them to help him plan a big surprise party for her the day of her appointment. And by help, I mean they plan the whole thing, clear it with him, and he hands over his credit card. These kids had no rules (besides the obvious don't break the law), no budget, and no curfew. They could do whatever they want for this party. \n\nThey planned a very fun party. They rented out the back room of a restaurant Elise likes. Her best friend, boyfriend, and maybe 20 friends will join them. After the restaurant, they rented out a theater at a luxury theater to watch a movie. Then Elise, her boyfriend, best friend, and a couple other kids are going to do an escape room, play laser tag, go go kart racing, and go to the arcade. Basically, do everything she's missed out on over the past year. They have reservations for everything and it's all paid for. I looked at how much all of this costs and it's in the thousands. \n\nThe problem is Lola and Luke are only allowed at dinner and Logan will be picked up after a couple of the activities. I think this is a celebration for all of us and that all of the kids should be included in this party but my husband said no, this party is for Elise and she'd want her friends with her, not her younger siblings. We're not even going to be at the same table as them. I reminded him that Logan will be going to the movies and arcade with them but my kids aren't allowed and he said it's because Elise is closer with Logan than my kids so she'd want Logan there for part of it. \n\nI figured I wasn't going to get anywhere with him so I went to Elise, told her about the party, and asked her to tell her dad to invite her siblings. After the shock from learning about the party wore off, she said she'd rather keep things the way they're planned because it sounds like a lot of fun. \n\nShe mentioned the party to my husband and he is furious that I went to her. He says it's not my place to try to insert my kids into \"her one night out\" and is mad that I \"robbed him of the opportunity to see the surprised look on her face at the party\". He's barely spoken to me since then and I'm starting to wonder if I was the asshole for ruining the surprise.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also trying to go to her to make it so your kids could be allowed was low.", "YTA just look at your title, imagine your husband did this to something you organised for your kid. \n\nTHE ENTITLEMENT she is 16 ofcourse she does not want a 12 year old and 9 year old with her during all of the parts of HER party. \n\nPlease check yourself.", "YTA - your post reads like jealousy  of what was planned. Your children sound to young for those activities and it was for Elise and her friends.  Massive apologies owed  by yourself", "Wow, you are unequivocally a massive arsehole! You couldn\u2019t see your step daughter have nice things (which it sounds like she needs & deserves after having a really shitty year), so you decided you were going to ruin it.\n\nHonestly, if I was your husband I\u2019d divorce you. His children deserve better.\n\nYTA", "Wow..just wow...the party is for her stepdaughter, you know, the one that was so sick that she pretty much missed out on a year with her friends and bf...here comes her father who tries to surprise her to make up for time lost, to give her one day of fun with her own crew..and then you waltz right in, acting entitled and jealous because the party isn't for you or your kiddos..YTA..", "YTA wow", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA, wtf is wrong with you?!", "What is your problem with this  ill child? YTA", "YTA. this girl was supposed to be having a SURPRISE party for something she went through and you ruined it because you\u2019re selfish.", "It's nice to know that evil stepmothers don't just exist in Disney films.\n\nYTA. Big time", "YTA\n\nTf is wrong with you?! She's 16, been in and out of hospital, missed out a lot for the past year. And your husband decided to do something special for her, but you fucking ruined it because your kids weren't included?! Woman! She's the oldest and wants to have fun without younger kids! Let her be! I would understand if my older sister does that, I literally don't care, especially if she'd been sick! You are an ASSHOLE!!! \n\nAPOLOGISE NOW AND DONT THINK, JUST APOLOGISE TO HER AND YOUR HUSBAND!", "YTA entitled", "YTA. It's not for your kids. It's for Elise.  While I understand your kids will be upset there's this big party and they can't go, it's still not for them. You could have gone several routes to make sure they didn't miss out on a good time, but you chose to deliberately ruin a surprise for Elise and then try to force it through manipulating a child through other, much younger children and yourself. \nThere were plenty of other things you could've done that wouldn't even cost money, just the time you would've spent at the party anyway. Take them for a walk, fudge, you could take them to a separate movie. I feel terrible for Elise and having her party spoiled for no good reason.", "Husband should just divorce her already. No wonder her first marriage didn't work out. I don't think the third time's the charm is going to work in her case.", "Even if by some roundabout logic she had some point about her kids not being invited, I'm not saying she does but lets set it aside for now, I don't understand how ANYONE could think they weren't being TA when they attempted to ruin the party out of spite for that. \n\nOP your issue was with your husband, not your stepdaughter, so please take a moment of introspection as to why you felt the need to take your anger at your husband out on your poor stepdaughter and her being able to enjoy something? YTA", "YTA- wow. Wow. \nShe\u2019s 16! Your kids are babies to her.\nHer friends went to huge trouble to plan this surprise. All these wonderful things and you just stomped right through it. You took something irreplaceable, the surprise, and tore it up. \nI would be considering divorce if I was your husband. Your behaviour is so baffling selfish. I\u2019m amazed you didn\u2019t notice when you wrote this out.", "Yup. OP can't fathom the fact her own kids won't be the centre of attention for this celebration of her stepdaughter's return to better health and a sense of normalcy. How shallow can you get, OP for ruining this surprise? YTA!!", "Not just a great deal of time, over 6% of her entire life.", "Reminds me of the mother who used to expect her children to get HER gifts on THEIR birthdays because she should have been celebrated for giving birth to them tbh.", "One of the clearest YTA decisions on this website. Truly heinous and unfixable. You went behind your husband's back to destroy something for his seriously ill teenager all because your elementary school aged kids weren't included. This would make me reconsider our entire relationship.", "YTA.\nWho wants their little siblings in a party with their friends, there's an age gap, why would you do that to her? Or your husband?", "Who wants their little siblings in a party with their friends, there's an age gap, why would you do that to her? Or your husband?", "Came here to say this! Nicely put! \n\nIn addition she is 16, her life revolves around her friends", "OP is probably bitter that her husband has been giving Elise more attention through this illness than to OP's kids.", "OP and her kids should be barred from the party. Guess we shouldn't ruin her surprise of the divorce papers either?", "And which 16 years old girl wants a 9 years old boy at a party??", "Seriously, my heart is broken for the dad. He has probably been waiting for this day for a long time and she ruined it on purpose", "\ud83e\ude9emirror mirror on the wall, \nWHAT ABOUT *MY* CHILDREN THO?\ud83e\ude9e", "Elise and her dad, who has no doubt also had a desperate year. He just wanted to see his daughter surprised and delighted and his wife took that away from him.\n\nI think a lot of comments are missing what a thoughtless thing that was to do to the man she's meant to love.", "Also, her kids are much younger! They wouldn't even be able to participate fully and the stepdaughter would just end up babysitting!", "this party is to celebrate 1. Elise recovering from serious health issues where at 16 yo she spent a year in and out of hospitals and being too sick to go to school, which is major, and 2. letting Elise make up for lost time (the last year of her life spent being seriously ill) with her friends.  Elise spent an entire year without school, without her school chums and BF, being sick, not able to go out and do normal 16 yo things.    And you, an adult, are effing jealous and think it's not fair because Elise the sick girl got more attention???  So that was some hardship on your children, who are not only much younger but also healthy????  You think being so ill you can't go to school and you're in and out of the hospital is about getting all the attention???  You're just jealous that your husband is spending money on his bio daughter Elise.  Think of this as her sweet 16 party, if that helps.  Are your children old enough for a sweet 16 party?? No, I don't think so, so it shouldn't bother them that they aren't invited to the after dinner activities.  They are invited to the celebration dinner, that's more than enough, so why are you being so petty????  You deliberately ruined the surprise your husband and Elise's friends planned for her.  AH, YTA, full stop.  No excuse for such nasty behavior, and don't put it on your children, they never asked you to do that, you did it on your own after you saw what the party cost.", "Strong r/ImTheMainCharacter vibes", "honestly i\u2019d be surprised if her presence is even welcome at the party after the stunt she pulled", "Yes. \"Because she feels better now\" (stepmom thinking)", "Bu bu but\u2026 You don\u2019t understand!\n\n\nHer kids are different! They\u2019re special. Why can\u2019t you guys see that?\n\n\nDo I need an /s?", "Also r/ActuallyTheChild vibes too. OP did what kids do when they don't get the answer they want from one parent. Go ask the other."]}
