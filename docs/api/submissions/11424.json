{"id": 11424, "submission_id": "11hqtj1", "title": "AITA for ruining my stepdaughter's surprise because my kids weren't included", "selftext": "My husband and I each have 2 kids. He has Elise (16f) and Logan (12f) and I have Lola (12f) and Luke (9m). Elise was very sick this past year. She wasn't able to go to school and she was in and out of the hospital. She's starting to recover and her doctor cleared her to go back to school part time. \n\nWhen my husband heard that Elise could go back to school, he texted Elise's best friend and her boyfriend. He told them the news and asked them to help him plan a big surprise party for her the day of her appointment. And by help, I mean they plan the whole thing, clear it with him, and he hands over his credit card. These kids had no rules (besides the obvious don't break the law), no budget, and no curfew. They could do whatever they want for this party. \n\nThey planned a very fun party. They rented out the back room of a restaurant Elise likes. Her best friend, boyfriend, and maybe 20 friends will join them. After the restaurant, they rented out a theater at a luxury theater to watch a movie. Then Elise, her boyfriend, best friend, and a couple other kids are going to do an escape room, play laser tag, go go kart racing, and go to the arcade. Basically, do everything she's missed out on over the past year. They have reservations for everything and it's all paid for. I looked at how much all of this costs and it's in the thousands. \n\nThe problem is Lola and Luke are only allowed at dinner and Logan will be picked up after a couple of the activities. I think this is a celebration for all of us and that all of the kids should be included in this party but my husband said no, this party is for Elise and she'd want her friends with her, not her younger siblings. We're not even going to be at the same table as them. I reminded him that Logan will be going to the movies and arcade with them but my kids aren't allowed and he said it's because Elise is closer with Logan than my kids so she'd want Logan there for part of it. \n\nI figured I wasn't going to get anywhere with him so I went to Elise, told her about the party, and asked her to tell her dad to invite her siblings. After the shock from learning about the party wore off, she said she'd rather keep things the way they're planned because it sounds like a lot of fun. \n\nShe mentioned the party to my husband and he is furious that I went to her. He says it's not my place to try to insert my kids into \"her one night out\" and is mad that I \"robbed him of the opportunity to see the surprised look on her face at the party\". He's barely spoken to me since then and I'm starting to wonder if I was the asshole for ruining the surprise.", "created_utc": 1677908169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hqtj1/aita_for_ruining_my_stepdaughters_surprise/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has Elise (16f) and Logan (12f) and I have Lola (12f) and Luke (9m). Elise was very sick this past year. She wasn't able to go to school and she was in and out of the hospital. She's starting to recover and her doctor cleared her to go back to school part time. \n\nWhen my husband heard that Elise could go back to school, he texted Elise's best friend and her boyfriend. He told them the news and asked them to help him plan a big surprise party for her the day of her appointment. And by help, I mean they plan the whole thing, clear it with him, and he hands over his credit card. These kids had no rules (besides the obvious don't break the law), no budget, and no curfew. They could do whatever they want for this party. \n\nThey planned a very fun party. They rented out the back room of a restaurant Elise likes. Her best friend, boyfriend, and maybe 20 friends will join them. After the restaurant, they rented out a theater at a luxury theater to watch a movie. Then Elise, her boyfriend, best friend, and a couple other kids are going to do an escape room, play laser tag, go go kart racing, and go to the arcade. Basically, do everything she's missed out on over the past year. They have reservations for everything and it's all paid for. I looked at how much all of this costs and it's in the thousands. \n\nThe problem is Lola and Luke are only allowed at dinner and Logan will be picked up after a couple of the activities. I think this is a celebration for all of us and that all of the kids should be included in this party but my husband said no, this party is for Elise and she'd want her friends with her, not her younger siblings. We're not even going to be at the same table as them. I reminded him that Logan will be going to the movies and arcade with them but my kids aren't allowed and he said it's because Elise is closer with Logan than my kids so she'd want Logan there for part of it. \n\nI figured I wasn't going to get anywhere with him so I went to Elise, told her about the party, and asked her to tell her dad to invite her siblings. After the shock from learning about the party wore off, she said she'd rather keep things the way they're planned because it sounds like a lot of fun. \n\nShe mentioned the party to my husband and he is furious that I went to her. He says it's not my place to try to insert my kids into \"her one night out\" and is mad that I \"robbed him of the opportunity to see the surprised look on her face at the party\". He's barely spoken to me since then and I'm starting to wonder if I was the asshole for ruining the surprise.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is very similar to the story from a couple of months ago about the stepmom who was pissed that her husband didn\u2019t throw a good enough party for her that she spent over $10,000 on a surprise party for her stepdaughter, who she knew hated surprises. The husband and the step daughter left the party and the tone deaf woman who threw the party was mad that her husband wouldn\u2019t reimburse her for the party. They ended up divorced.
