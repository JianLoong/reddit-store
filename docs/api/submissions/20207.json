He should never have promised it to her or even mentioned it without talking to you first. I don't know that you needed to say what if they got divorced (or lost it, what if your granddaughter or daughter if you had one lost it?) But you're in the right. It's yours to do with as you wish", "NTA your heirloom your rules. Ace nor DIL are entitled to anything.", "NTA.  It is yours.  You can give it to a stranger if you want.  He is the one being rude.  Why doesn\u2019t he buy her something nice and start their own \u201cfamily heirloom\u201d thing?", ">He said it was rude of me  \n>  \n>he already mentioned the charm to Julia\n\n*He's* the one being rude. To you and also to Julia for promising something that wasn't his to promise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I had planned on giving my granddaughter the charm myself, when I thought she was ready. This is what I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\n100% makes sense and 100% your decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He became very angry with me for \u201cdoubting them\u201d and hung up.\n\nWell he sounds pretty immature so...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, Ace is.", "NTA. You can carry on the tradition however you would like, it\u2019s your charm. He shouldn\u2019t have promised something to her that wasn\u2019t his to give away.", "NTA.  \n\nHe made this a problem by mentioning it to his wife and had no right to make *any* promises. Now he's acting like a spoiled brat because he can't have his way. Ignore the situation. You know what you want to do and eventually you'll give it to your granddaughter. He can go pound sand.", "Nta. As long as the daughter gets it in the end what does it matter to them", "Definitely NTA\n\nHave you ever mentioned giving this to any of your sons\u2019 partners? It\u2019s definitely not Ace\u2019s place to get involved with this situation unless you decide include him. \n\nDo you like Julia? Perhaps your son could take it to jewelers & see if they could design something similar for her? Then your granddaughter gets the heirloom.", "NTA\n\nWasnt his to promise.\nShould have discussed with you regardless.\nNot your problem to fulfil a promise that wasnt his to make.\n\nStick to your plan.  \n\nIf your son is pushing you because he promised it to his wife and now she is pushing him because \"she thought she was getting it\", then you should def wait and give it to your granddaughter when the time is right.  Because if the DIL is now pushing your son to have you give something up that matters a great deal to you, before you are ready, she would probably \"forget\" to give it to your granddaughter when the time comes.\n\nAlso more fair because your other sons may marry, and this giving it to your eldest granddaughter eliminates potential  DIL battles about it \n\nI dont know about everyone else,  but even if my husband told me i was getting an heirloom from his mother, if i learned that wasnt my MIL's intent, i wouldn't want anything that wasnt intended for me. I would want his mother to deal with as she sees fit because it is hers.  Who can feel good having something that has to be pulled from someone else, and not given freely.\n\nSo if the DIL is pushing, that is confirmation you are doing the right thing.", "NTA- this is your possession. You will give it to who you think deserves it best. It is not your fault he said anything to her or promised her she was getting it. That\u2019s entirely on him. They aren\u2019t entitled to anything and he was rude to assume you would even give it to them.", "NtA. Only you have the right with that heirloom. I share your sentiments you should pass it only to your grandchild to avoid complications incase they get separated or divorce .", "NTA. I would give it to your grand daughter when you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m kind of surprised your son told his wife she would get it", "NTA- That\u2019s your heirloom to give.  I think it\u2019s a very lovely idea to gift it to your granddaughter when you think the time is right. Your son is being a real goober. If he\u2019s usually level headed, have a talk with him. If he\u2019s always entitled, I\u2019ll offer up my favorite \u201casked and answered, kiddo\u201d response.", "NTA. DIL is not the oldest daughter. On top of that, (1) it is your charm, and (2) you are not dead. The oldest granddaughter should get it when you are ready to part with it, or when you pass away, whichever comes first.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't your son's heirloom to give and he shouldn't have promised it to his wife.", "NTA\n\nIt was fine for him to ask. To expect it and to have already told his wife she\u2019d be getting it is too far. It\u2019s not his to promise.", "Just gift it directly to Granddaughter", "NTA. It would be super duper duper nice of you to pass it to your DIL but like you said anything could happen and if you gifted it to her she wouldn't have to give it back to the family if they ever divorced or if they didn't have a daughter. \nIt was ridiculous of your son to even mention it to his wife (not his to give or expect).\nHe doesn't have a claim to it. \nWait and give it to your Granddaughter.", "ESH:  \n\nThe heirloom is YOUR possession, not your son's.  He had no right to intimate to his wife that she or her daughter would be receiving it at any time or than whenever you decide.  Your son is 100% in the wrong here.  \n\nYour suggesting that he and his wife could wind up divorced was very inappropriate though.  He was understandably upset by this.  You should simply have said that you'd pass the heirloom down to whomever you chose at the time that you consider appropriate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is up to you to decide when, how and who you give it to.  This is your meaningful heirloom, why would you get to choose the way in which it is passed on, and who says you have to do i5 why you are alive.   you might want to give it to your granddaughter on her 18th birthday or for graduation, her sweet 16th, her 1st,her 25th, or on her wedding day, upon your death, and in a special and meaningful way of your choosing, when you are ready.  \n\nHe needs to settle down, he is be rude, entitled, and irrational.  I assume you have provided many things over the years for your son, for his wife, for them as a couple to their and to their first child.

Detail that you're going to give the charm to her daughter when she turns 16/18/21 and that you'd like her to be involved when that happens. Maybe get Julia a tiny token and say you're starting a new tradition with her or whatever. Don't go into why you can't give her the charm because she might divorce and leave the family or whatever.\n\nYou don't have to give her the heirloom, but you don't have to let this tank everything because you son is clumsy.", "NTA. The charm is yours to give. Your son messed up and is trying to save his own ass.", "He should buy his wife her own charm.\nNTA.", "NTA, honestly, if it was my heirloom, I wouldn't give it up either stand your ground and don't give it up", "I agree. The demand would make me want to be extra sure to keep it away from her.
