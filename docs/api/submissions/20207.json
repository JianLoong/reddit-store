Because if the DIL is now pushing your son to have you give something up that matters a great deal to you, before you are ready, she would probably \"forget\" to give it to your granddaughter when the time comes.\n\nAlso more fair because your other sons may marry, and this giving it to your eldest granddaughter eliminates potential  DIL battles about it \n\nI dont know about everyone else,  but even if my husband told me i was getting an heirloom from his mother, if i learned that wasnt my MIL's intent, i wouldn't want anything that wasnt intended for me.

Where a 19 or 20yr old guy wanted to propose to his gf of a few months using heirloom in the family which was promised to his 16yr old sister when she is ready to marry, as had been the custom, as the son was aware.\n\nHe demanded his mother take the ring off her finger and give it to him, because he had decided as eldest son, when he gets married the DIL would be the eldest female (by marriage).  Not surprisingly the mother declined. The gf continued to badger the bf for the ring his mother was wearing.\n\nThus the son continued to badger his mother, so she decided to put the ring in the safe so it wouldnt be a constant reminder.   The son broke into the safe to get the ring and his gf already had it on her finger within a few days.\nShe refused to give it back saying she couldnt imagine getting married without this ring and it was HER ring now because the son had given it to her (knowing the mother's position, knowing it wasnt her bf's to give).  The dad told.the son he must return the ring, because he knew it doesnt belong to  him to propose with.  He offered to allow them to take ring to jeweler & have copy made but the son & gf both declined because it was now HER ring and she couldn't imagine marrying without it.\n\nEventually they had to get the police involved & press charges to get her to return the ring, with the gf knowing full well he stole it, and.with the bf knowing full well it would be pass to his sister when she later.has a bf & is planning to marry.", "Probably wants to sell it", "That was my assumption once I heard that OP had no daughters.", "Did you mean to say not passing it to the granddaughter before she's independent? \n\nIf so, I agree. Her mom could easily claim she's not responsible enough yet and take it.", "And likely the only reason the girlfriend in that case didn't turn around and sell it immediately is she knew she'd have caught criminal charges then. Seriously demanding a valuable antique right this second from family members is like flashing a giant neon sign of, \"I need or want the money and plan to sell this valuable antique as soon as humanly possible!\" \n\nAnd yeah, voice of experience here. It's why I no longer talk to some of my relatives.", "Why do we think DIL will steal? It's the son who's mad.", "NTA. It is in your care and you make the decision. As my GG once told me, \"lots of women come and go in marriages, so I will decide what goes to whom.\" She only had boys and one granddaughter.

It was kind of his fault for even bringing it up to her. You are right though, with divorce being so common now days, it may never be returned to the family. It\u2019s your heirloom you can decide who in the family gets it and when.", "NTA. My grandmother had a very valuable diamond ring from her side of the family. I was her only granddaughter and I was the one named in her will to receive it, skipping over my own mother because I was the youngest female relative in the family. As my mother has told me it is MY ring, to do with what I please, but she did ask me to do what I can to ensure it stays within the family. Its your charm. it's been entrusted to you, you do what you feel is right with it. It's ridiculous that this is even being discussed unless you're actively making a will or something. I don't have daughters and I'm not even sure I'll have children in which case I'll decide then where the ring is best suited to go in my own will.", "NTA. It's your charm. It is rude to ever expect someone else belongings. And even if family heirloom \"rules\" were binding, it goes to your granddaughter, not DIL, and at your discretion (or passing). People are so entitled.", "are you seriously ill that you you won't be using jewellery in the future and they are thinking about how to divide up your assets?\n\nNTA - its yours and up to you who you give it to and When?

You are not doubting them, you are honoring your family tradition of passing the charm to the eldest female child, in this case it happens to be a granddaughter.

We have adopted family members and half family members, and they are part of it, their children are part of it, but their significant others are not a part of it.", "NTA \n\nI thought he would be asking for his daughter.\n\nHe should have talked with you about it before he said anything to his wife.\n\nWhen you said, you had three sons, I immediately thought that the first granddaughter would get the heirloom.\n\nMaybe if they had been married for decades and she proved to be a 'daughter' you might emotionally lean that way but to demand it is quite entitled.", "Tell him to start his own heirloom chain.  He can design and make, or have made, a piece of jewelry to be passed down to daughters in law.", "It is in your possession.  To pass it on to the next female should take place after you pass away. You have no obligation to hive up an heirloom rightly yours  \nFor anyone else.", "Your son made a promise he couldnt keep and spoke for a possession that wasnt his to give away.  He needs to bear the pain he caused with his wife and any embarrassment is his, not yours.  Your 26 year old son has some more growing up to do... \n\nYou can give the heirloom to exactly anyone you please at whatever time you deem appropriate.  Bottom line, end of story and no arguments.  You are in control of the heirloom, dont let anybody pressure you.  NTA", "NTA", "I think that's a totally reasonable expectation that it will go to the first-born granddaughter.

If they got divorced, she could sell the charm, or end up gifting it to a stepdaughter, or niece, or whatever, and the charm would never return to your family.\n\nThe charm will have to skip a generation and go the first girl of the following generation: your granddaughter.", "This is a situation where there might be a legalistically correct answer, but who is \"right\" will depend greatly on where you stand. \n\nShort version. Your property, your choice.\n\nBut. I get wanting to abide by tradition, but note that that you're already breaking tradition as you don't have daughters yourself. So, you're already making a compromise in a way that let's you simply do what you want to. Fine, but again you aren't abiding by tradition so it's hard to still use the notion of tradition as justification. Giving it to your DIL would be no more or less respectful to the tradition--just another attempt at honoring its spirit.\n\nAnd while you're entirely in the right to bypass the DIL, it will look like and feel like a slight. And doing so because they might get divorced? Well, ok... but presumably you gave them a wedding gift, right? And didn't hold out until you were sure the wedding \"took\"? You attended their wedding, even knowing the percentage of marriages that end in divorce?\n\nAnd, are there already feelings out there, like you don't like DIL, or favor other siblings? That may impact response.\n\nFinal word, you can do what you want to with your property. DIL doesn't have a right to the heirloom. But there are other currents and all choices come with consequences. NTA", "NTA, she isn't blood and if they ever separated your family would loose the heirloom", "NTA. It\u2019s not his to give away. It\u2019s yours. You could either bury it with yourself or give it to whomever you wish, but he has no rights to it. It\u2019ll also mean more to his future daughter if you have a relationship with her and give it to her.", "NTA", "NTA.  However, you could have stopped at the fact that you were going to give it to your eldest granddaughter when it was time.  Mentioning the idea of divorce was not the best argument back.  All you had to do was say that it is only passed down to blood relatives and that the current possessor of said heirloom passes it when it is time.  It is fair to chide him for promising it to his wife or even bringing it up to her as she is not blood-related.  \n\nAt the end of the day, it is yours and you get to decide if you want to carry on the tradition of passing it on, handing it off to the eldest female of your son's generation in the family, or taking it to your grave.", "NTA. Your family tradition is that it goes to the oldest daughter, not the wife of the oldest son. Saving it for a granddaughter makes sense. Plus it is yours to give, not Julia's.", "NTA!!!", "NTA. However, your delivery of your response is on the AH side. Why didn\u2019t you just tell him your plans to give your granddaughter the charm when became older. You did not have to bring up your concerns about a possible divorce. All you had to do was say that the charm means so much to you and that you were still enjoying it.

Kindly speak to your daughter-in-law, and inform her that it is not an insult to her, and that your son should not have promised something that was not his to begin with and that it is going to be for your granddaughter and that\u2019s final.

You can do what you want with your possession \n\nBut understand that the message you are sending Julia is that she will never really be considered part of the family. I experienced something similar from my in-laws. It sent me a clear message that even though we've been married for decades, they don't consider me a real family member. I was shocked and hurt and it changed the way I felt about them. I kept that in mind when they got older and needed help. They need not expect me to treat them like family either.
