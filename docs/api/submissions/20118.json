It is understandable that you became upset and frustrated in that situation. Your teacher should have shown more empathy and compassion towards your predicament.\r In summary, you were not in the wrong. It is important for educators to be sensitive to the needs and realities of their students.

Brother cried out (semi-jokingly) \u201ceww why wouldn\u2019t you just tell me I didn\u2019t want to know?!?\u201d He looked proud walking away with Mum and I doubled over in hysterical laughter.

And then at the end of class tied a jumper round their waist and ran to the bathroom. \n\nMy wife went to a strict school with no flexibility and this is apparently how they managed. Moment of epiphany after that conversation realising why my school lab partner asked to borrow my blazer 'because it's cold' in the summer...then tied it round her waist (?) twenty years prior.\n\nRidiculous and I'm glad more girls (and boys) these days are willing to make a scene or walk out. We told our girls if you need the bathroom urgently and aren't allowed to go, go anyway and we as the adults will deal with the consequences.

There's this weird phenomenon where peeing on the string wicks the pee right up into the tampon, soaking it through. It started happening to me as I got older.

My school has a no-bathroom at the initial or final ten minutes of the period because kids would ask to go to the bathroom and skip the whole class, or go at the end of the period for too long and leave their stuff behind and interrupt the classes gathering it and getting a pass. Before I started saying 'no' my class of eight students would interrupt classes every ten minutes asking to go, then they're come back and I'd constantly have to re-explain what I'm teaching. \n\nAlso, do you remember Devious Licks? First year of Covid and they're tearing apart the bathroom for TikTok views. It was genuinely traumatizing. The entire eighth grade staff quit. That put down bathroom rules that are still there because all our kids have been profoundly affected by Covid and they are still acting out all over the place.
