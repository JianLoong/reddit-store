It is understandable that you became upset and frustrated in that situation. Your teacher should have shown more empathy and compassion towards your predicament.\r In summary, you were not in the wrong. It is important for educators to be sensitive to the needs and realities of their students.

Mum told him he didn\u2019t want to know. He kept pushing. I told him exactly what we were talking about (\u201cI am having cramps in my abdomen due to the fact my uterus is shedding it\u2019s lining and it is being pushed out of my body in clots of various sizes and liquid blood\u201d etc). Brother cried out (semi-jokingly) \u201ceww why wouldn\u2019t you just tell me I didn\u2019t want to know?!?\u201d He looked proud walking away with Mum and I doubled over in hysterical laughter. Mum then turned to me and said \u201cplease don\u2019t ever say that to a teacher, I don\u2019t think I could hold in the laughter if they called to complain about it\u201d", "NTA\n\nregardless of gender if a pupil needs to go to the bathroom let them go. If you have to focus on your faeces, you can't focus on the lesson.   \nAnd a teacher that is surprised that a girl needs to go to the bathroom more than once needs to be confronted with reality! If that dissgusts him, it only shows how bad his education is :D", "NTA, teachers should just all kids go when they have an emergency. Not just for periods, I developed IBS as an adult, but I'd imagine things could get very bad if they didn't let a kid who has IBS to go to the bathroom when needed.", "NTA even if it would been another emergency as it would be the number 2 that can come with a vengeance at times... i never to this day understood this rule. bathroom need is bathroom need.\n\nthey should invest in hiring a bathroom guard, but never ever abuse kids by telling them to hold it or to even get to accidents! \n\nFor me for example , over the years i ve gotten good at holding it (not the period coz duh), it is actually painfull, from the first time i feel the urge to the time it releases... so.. its not like your in a moving car and... the bathroom is right across the halway most of the times....", "Teachers have no right to hold this power over students and honestly that power is a bit of an illusion. OP has full right to just say it\u2019s an emergency and walk out, no need to wait for permission.  No one should be punished for this.  As a father of a young daughter, I\u2019ll give her my consent for that, and look forward to going into the school for a harsh word if there is ever the slightest pushback.", "Yup, to entice the smokers to quit smoking.", "I'm gonna stop asking questions. Been downvoted too much and a bit TMI at this point :D", "Literally. When I was in school I remember getting up and walking out of class to go to the bathroom even after getting a no if it was that bad, and then skipping the detention I got for it. Let them try to explain what happened to the principal and see if they can do it while sounding reasonable.", "> I do not know how my wife handled this sort of issue when she was in high school.\n\nThey crossed their legs and hoped really, REALLY hard that they didn't bleed through their clothing. And then at the end of class tied a jumper round their waist and ran to the bathroom. \n\nMy wife went to a strict school with no flexibility and this is apparently how they managed. Moment of epiphany after that conversation realising why my school lab partner asked to borrow my blazer 'because it's cold' in the summer...then tied it round her waist (?) twenty years prior.\n\nRidiculous and I'm glad more girls (and boys) these days are willing to make a scene or walk out. We told our girls if you need the bathroom urgently and aren't allowed to go, go anyway and we as the adults will deal with the consequences. Some kids sadly don't have that support.\n\nYou can't hold it in either so it's worse than needing to poop. You can tense the vaginal muscle but not to the degree of your urethra or rectum. Closer to diarrhoea or incontinence, it's coming, ready or not. I've been told you just feel a kind of pressure then whoops, there it is. Fuck all of that man.", "\"it's an emergency\" is a reason and even \"i really need to use the bathroom\" is reason enough", "*And he still thinks it isn\u2019t \u201cfair\u201d that girls get this \u201cspecial privilege.\u201d*\n\nWell, aren't we blessed. LOL", "Why doesn\u2019t he just let everyone go to the bathroom? There, no special privileges.", "He is a dolt", "While I think everyone should have the right to use the restroom when needed, in all fairness, girls can't hold in their menstrual flow like holding your bladder.", "Let them know you\u2019re going, but don\u2019t ask permission.", "I know, right?", "Which is just wrong.", "Original equipment manufacturer.", "Original Equipment Manufacturer i.e. females who haven't had a hysterectomy.", "Thats not how many periode work my guy. I have them super irregular. Like sometimes it skips a month other Times it comes back after just two weeks. Thats a hardcore case by me but its not Times for most people. And just leasing a Tampon in just in case calls for infections", "I read it as playfully specifying cis women. I can\u2019t really imagine a trans woman not having a somewhat accurate understanding of the involved anatomy, but I\u2019ve definitely heard from plenty of cis women that girls shouldn\u2019t use tampons so they don\u2019t lose their virginity or that they have to take their tampon out every time they pee because they don\u2019t want to pee on it.", "That is so cute!! I'm stealing it lol \ud83d\ude06", "Some of us are lucky and we get warning signs before the bleeding starts, I usually got a very distinctive back pain beforehand, but not always. So yeah, occasionally I would get a little bit of blood as it starts so I'd have go change and put on a pad. It is what it is.", "To be fair, some women do have to change their tampon after peeing. There's this weird phenomenon where peeing on the string wicks the pee right up into the tampon, soaking it through. It started happening to me as I got older. I guess with natural ageing everything down there gets a little looser and so tampons weren't sitting as high as they did when I was younger. Hence, the pee tampon.", "I know that anatomy varies, and it\u2019s always *possible*, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anywhere near as common that someone can\u2019t pee with a tampon in, as it is that someone\u2019s confused. \n\nThough I also don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had that conversation without discussing tucking the strings out of the way, because that\u2019s a pretty common thing to get wet if you just pee without doing anything abnormal. I can also see someone else being less okay with 1-2 drops of urine high on the strings than I am, but that\u2019s not really what people complain about either. \n\nI\u2019ve also heard at least twice that it\u2019s simply impossible to do- it doesn\u2019t come out. I have no idea if that\u2019s an application error, an anatomical difficulty, a psychosomatic block or something totally else"]}
