It is understandable that you became upset and frustrated in that situation. Your teacher should have shown more empathy and compassion towards your predicament.\r In summary, you were not in the wrong. It is important for educators to be sensitive to the needs and realities of their students.

Tampons were not common in those days, so having your period meant no swimming since why wear those thick bulky pads in a pool to get immediately soaked with pool water, and were embarrassingly visible.\n\nEdit to add the late '60s was when sex ed was just started being taught in the schools. Before that it was up to Mom, with varying results and info.", "I mean the whole pee thing could just be a preference, I personally hate the feeling of a wet tampon string so I change it every time I go to the bathroom. Uses up more tampons, sure, but at least this way I don\u2019t forget to change it and the tampon rarely leaks", "As I said to another commenter,\n\nI remember watching a surgery on ftm way like 20 years ago. It was *fascinating*. And that was so long ago I can't imagine how much more advanced the techniques have got for both kinds of transitions. Science is fucking wonderful. I'm so glad the options are there for those that want them!\n\nAnd yes, we refer to the after transition as having aftermarket parts. Nothing wrong with them and they work great! \n\nI came up with the analogy to explain to my mother how that stuff works when she was curious.", "I love it! \ud83d\ude38", "I love it, personally. It's a very slick way of explaining the concept. Well done!", "I really had no clue what a cervix actually was and how it worked until I was 20 weeks pregnant at age 30 and decided to educate myself. Most places, sex education is a joke.", "I wrote him a message explaining OEM and saying he's now a racing car, then I sent him a picture of a cool classic racing car in colours he likes with the comment \"you\" and of one of my favourite oldtimers (so completely OEM by German standards) with the comment \"me\". He answered \"Lol\"", "It truly is appalling, isn\u2019t it? We aren\u2019t born knowing all this. It has to be taught, and it so frequently isn\u2019t.", "YTA - \"dumbass assignment\". Some points - you had just used the bathroom and we're trying to go again. Teachers routinely deal with multiple bathroom trips and often times the assumption is an additional request is nefarious. That said, you could have walked up and told him you were having a bathroom emergency  (wording that however you want) and not shouted in front of the class. There are more mature ways to handle it instead of being rude about the assignment and shouting in front of the class. Menstruating, diarrhea, full bladder - the emergency is irrelevant. You should be respectful and when you are, you're treated with respect. And treated a little more grown up.", "NTA but your teacher is.", "NTA.  Maybe you could have approached him one on one instead of in front of the entire class, but doing it publicly doesn't automatically make it an asshole move.", "I always tell my kids to ask once to be polite and respectful, but no is not an acceptable answer.  Just go.", "NTA - unless you have a habit of going to the bathroom all the time or going for 20+ minutes, if a student had to go to the bathroom twice in one class I would assume that it was an emergency and, probably something embarrassing \"(runny poo, a period etc, and I'd just let them go.  If you are a student who asks to go to the bathroom 3 times a day though, then I can't really blame the teacher.  That being said, by 12th grade it seems a little weird to be obsessed with when students go to the bathroom, you're practically adults, if you miss instruction it's your problem.  I'm a middle school SPED teacher so it's a bit different.", "NTA, and an 18yo female adult shouldn't have to ask permission to go to the toilet. I hope you embarrassed him", "NTA. The teacher kept asking for an explanation - they shouldn't complain when they get one.", "NTA. Teachers like this don't make sense. If you're not smart enough to know girls need the bathroom at a moment's notice, you shouldn't be teaching other human beings.", "It\u2019s not like having to poop because you can\u2019t hold it in. There aren\u2019t sphincter muscles in a vaginal canal. It\u2019s more akin to having a bloody nose - you just start bleeding and can\u2019t do anything but run to the bathroom to sort yourself out.", "No one wears tampons before they have their period. Wtf.", "Oh that's really ridiculous", "Bro that\u2019s ridiculous. Why tf do I need to be discreet about something that is completely natural?", "1. Unpredictable periods exist.\n2. Constantly having those products to prevent it are privilege that not everyone has access to", "You absolutely should not be putting tampons into your dry vagina before you get your period. Holy shit no.", "You know what else is gonna cause a disruption? Someone bleeding through their clothes all over their chairs.", "I always had male teachers like this or worse when they knew it was due to your period would mock you because they thought you were being dramatic regarding having any period related symptoms. \n\nI remember once standing and asking to go to the nurse because I was very dizzy and nauseous due to the period pain and had the teacher call me a drama queen who was abusing the right to leave the class. Mid way through the teacher's rant I fainted. Turned out I had a burst ovarian cyst. \n\nReally there's no \"special privileges\" about this.", "Omg. You know what isn\u2019t \u201cfair\u201d? That women have to deal with bleeding and cramps and mood swings every month.", "I may come across rude but your mother is really the one why he became like this. Sexualizing basic function of female reproductive system is insane and i know she has been taught that from her time yet still. Him being a person in this society should know this basic things regarding what gender his partner or children would be, it's basic knowledge and should be known by cis men.", "I want to leave a bloody spot on your brother's chair so so bad lol", "His girlfriends might have been like your mom...", "Wow. I\u2019m kind of bummed he\u2019s a teacher! Here what I say at the beginning of the year to my music classes:\n\n\u201cWashroom is down the hall that way. If you have to go during rehearsal, don\u2019t disturb the rest of us by asking, just quietly get up and come back as soon as you can. Try to work out your bathroom breaks so you don\u2019t have to take them during rehearsal every time. If I notice you popping in an out a lot, we\u2019ll have a conversation. Otherwise, don\u2019t involve me in your bathroom logistics.\u201d\n\nI teach middle-school age music classes, and have never had a problem. I try to foster an atmosphere in the class where people try not to miss. When kids have to go, they just go quietly and come back.", "You say they have no right, but society holds them as responsible and liable to enough of a degree that the teachers have to care for things that the student may do/may happen to them while out of the classroom.", "In an American high school, classes are usually about an hour long, maybe less, with a few minutes between to travel from classroom to classroom. Any student can pee between classes (unless they have to travel especially far to their next classroom). Plus everyone gets a lunch period and most kids have at least one study hall/free period.\n\nIdeally I'd prefer all kids just go when they need to, of course. But as restrictions go, not letting teenage boys go during class isn't that bad. \n\nAnyone can have an emergency, though. Any student who's having diarrhea or nausea should be able to plead emergency and go.\n\nI was lucky during those years. All my teachers told us that if we *needed* to go we should just get up and go. If anything, the male teachers were more adamant about it. I guess one kid barfing in your classroom is all it takes.", "I stopped getting periods a couple years ago, after 40 years. Now every now & then when I\u2019m having a crappy day I remember to remind myself that at least I\u2019m not having a crappy day plus having my period!\n\nIt really is pretty awesome to not have that to deal with!

That is crazy they shouldve deff known better", ">Maybe coming to him infront and whispering to his ear\n\n\n\nWhy whisper? It's a normal body function that women have gone through for thousands of years.
