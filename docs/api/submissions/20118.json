Menstruation is a natural bodily function, and it can often be unpredictable and urgent. It is essential to prioritize your physical well-being and take care of yourself during such times.\r  \n\rYour teacher's response was insensitive and dismissive. It is inappropriate for a teacher to deny a student's request to use the restroom, especially when it concerns a personal and urgent matter like menstruation. The fact that you had already completed your assignment before asking to go to the restroom further demonstrates your responsible behavior as a student.\r Your outburst in front of the class was a direct result of your teacher's refusal and lack of understanding. It is understandable that you became upset and frustrated in that situation. Your teacher should have shown more empathy and compassion towards your predicament.\r In summary, you were not in the wrong. It is important for educators to be sensitive to the needs and realities of their students. Denying someone access to a bathroom when they have a legitimate need is unfair and can be harmful.", "Any teacher who power-trips over toilet access deserves to hear as much gross squishy detail as is necessary to make them knock it off.
