{"id": 4571, "submission_id": "zkaxz0", "title": "AITA for refusing to allow my families property (willed to me) be used for my cousins 2nd wedding?", "selftext": "I (27M) am the owner of a property that was formerly my grandpas home. My grandpa was a farmer and he had this awesome property built whenever my mom and her sisters were in high school. This was the family house, which my grandpa also built a giant garage on which my cousins have been using as a reception hall the last few years for their weddings. When my grandma died my grandpa and me started hanging more and I worked at the property since I was little. I am the only grandson he had. All my cousins on my moms side are girls. \n\nIn 2018 my grandpa passed away and I was left the property. This caused a bunch of drama amongst the family. But I know exactly why my grandpa did it. My grandpa was not a perfect person. He was very old fashioned. Hated divorce and was very traditional. His beliefs clashed with his daughters. He wanted to hand his farm down to a son. He didn\u2019t have any and none of my aunts married the type of dudes he liked. So I became the de facto option. My grandpa especially disliked how my aunts were in their relationships cause he preached commitment. That man loved and was loyal to my grandma. \n\nMy cousin (28F) is getting married this fall. I\u2019m at my parents house and my aunt goes \u201cwell the reception will be at the house\u201d. I told her nobody has talked to me yet. She said that since every other cousin had their reception there it should be a tradition. I said sure but they all asked me and I wanted them there. Her daughter didn\u2019t ask me and I don\u2019t support the wedding. \n\nIt\u2019s really legit reason. This is my cousins second wedding. I\u2019m not even close with her. We differ politically so I have her muted on social media. I didn\u2019t even know she was engaged. Me and this cousin hardly speak. Also this is her second marriage. She cheated on her first husband with this dude. Who was also married at the time. My grandpa would never approve of that or want that on his property. Also I would have to be involved in the set up and clean up if it\u2019s at the house. I don\u2019t care to sacrifice my time. If she wants to rent the property and my time. Then she can pay me a premium for the short notice. But I\u2019m not doing it for free. \n\nI explained this all to my aunt and my cousin. They both threw a fit and tried having my mom talk to me. She tried pulling the family card and a guilt trip about my cousin having no money. I said my cousin has no money because of her divorce. It\u2019s a sham wedding and her dad wouldn\u2019t support it and she knows that. There was a reason that her dad didn\u2019t trust the property to his own kids. I said all my other cousins have been good people so I was willing to help. But this cousin and aunt are rude. My mom said I won\u2019t be invited to Christmas most likely then. I said okay find another venue while you are at it (the house is the hangout spot for Christmas). My dad is calling me an AH but I need to a fair judgment.

You can cry until you're blue in the face that that man treated his wife well, but I highly doubt that's as true or as straightforward as you want it to be. You need to take off the blinders and accept that he was a complicated, flawed man who didn't always make the right calls and didn't always have the right motivations with the way he treated his own daughters. I highly doubt you were around to see your aunts' childhoods, and I highly doubt it was nearly as happy or as rosy of a picture as you'd want to believe from your grandfather's perspective.  \n* Your cousin and aunt are AHs for assuming they have free use of a property without even bothering to ask the actual property owner. That's rude and inappropriate. Regardless of how disagreeable your grandfather's views may have been, infidelity is a disgusting act across the board for any person with moral values and you're more than fair to make it clear that you don't want to disrespect your grandfather on the property you inherited from him by hosting a wedding reception that he would certainly be opposed to. \n* But you are still, despite having some good motivations here, an utter and total AH. Not supporting this wedding and not wanting to host it is one thing, but digging in on serious family conflict and harms that YOU WERE NOT A DIRECT PART OF is absolutely wrong with remarks like \"There was a reason that her dad didn't trust the property to his own kids.\" Especially when you yourself have made it clear that no matter how successful and \"good\" daughters they were, they simply would never have directly inherited anything from your grandfather the way that you did because they are WOMEN. From the way you wrote it, it sounds like the only scenarios in which they would have inherited anything was if their HUSBANDS were acceptable in your grandfather's eyes and THEY would be the ones to directly inherit. Where do you shop for this audacity? I mean seriously? You yourself made it clear that no amount of \"good\" behavior from them would have changed the fact that they're women and that was an automatic out in your grandfather's eyes. And you have the audacity to jab an entire family where it hurts just so you can make a point to two disrespectful relatives? You have no idea what happened behind closed doors to all of those women when they were children. You have absolutely no idea. You have far less context to this situation than you like to think, and if you don't want to be an AH you need to start moving with the assumption that there is so much to your grandfather's family issues that YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT. \n\nFrom the way you wrote this story, it sounds like you made those remarks directly to your mother with the whole 'there's a reason that your dad didn't trust the property to his own kids' when your own mother is one of those children?! She doesn't even want to spend Christmas with you anymore?! **Are you prepared to burn all of the bridges you have with your LIVING family just so you can feel like the king of an empty castle?** That is the road you are just careening down right now. Assuming that your mother isn't an abusive monster, you need to show actual respect to her, she knows more about this situation than you possibly could. You didn't get that house because you're responsible. You didn't get that house because you spent enough years kissing ass and getting close. You knew for a long time leading up to this that you were the inheritor purely because you were the only \"acceptable\" biologically related male in regards to your grandpa at the time. The \"de facto\" option as you put it. If you insist on burning all these bridges now, don't be shocked when they (including your mother and father) don't want you back in the picture in the future.

You're entitled to use it any way you please, and your family are not entitled to expect access.    \n\n\nHowever, it's clear your grandpa was a sexist asshole, and the ONLY reason he gave the property to you is because you A.  have a penis and 2.   are also a sexist asshole.    \n\n\nSo, congrats.   You're not the asshole for asserting your right to your possessions, but you are, in fact, a giant, creepy asshole.", " Nta and now they also lost the Christmas spot, if i were you i would invite the ones that are on your side for the Christmas in the house, the rest can go to other place", "ESH. They should never assume they could use the property without talking to you first. All the moral bullshit is just total creep vibe.", "NTA\n\nYour house your rules. I may not agree with the reason your grandfather left you the property but regardless he did and no one else is entitled to use the space.", "NTA, it is your property. It is common courtesy to at least reach out to you before assuming that it is OK to use the family farm. All differences politically and lifestyle aside, they are not entitled to the use of your land or time. You do need to be prepared that this will change the dynamic of the relationship you have with your family, including your parents. If you can sincerely live with that so be it. Just because you are NTA (in my opinion) doesn't mean you are going to be in the right with your family. With that, you do have to respect that people get to live their lives how they wish, including poor choices. While I respect you and your grandfather's values, those were HIS values, and the property is now yours and you should use inline with YOUR values. Nobody in your family is obligated to live their life according to his wishes and world view.", "Could you maybe have been put off by your aunt calling **your** property \"the house?\" It is certainly your right to refuse for another to use your property. What I find alarming is your mother saying you won't be invited to Christmas held on a property you own. The past drama can't be helped, but I would make sure that your family knows that is your property and that they are not to be using it for Christmas, weddings, graduations, etc. without your consent. And maybe for future events you should have a contract that they are responsible for cleanup,  damages, etc. I'm assuming you pay for insurance coverage on this property. I don't think you are so much TA but your views and opinions are somewhat antiquated. Your cousin's behavior is appalling and there is nothing that says you have to make things easy for someone who makes such poor decisions. What she did to her husband was intentional and cruel.", "I am going to say NTA.\nBut, regardless how you feel about your cousin's life, it is her life to live. Mistake or not. (Not anyone's business but her own.)\nBut the entitlement of that they can just expect the same treatment without asking is wrong. I have turned people down outright for such assumptions. It is your house/home. Who in their right mind would just invite themselves into someone's house or plan something there without permission? Rude and entitled people who really don't grasp the idea of what a guest is.", "NTA strictly bc it's ultimately your property but dont use such antiquated notions to justify saying no. If you just dont want them there, then say that.  Also, I cannot stand it when people try to use the 'family' card to try and manipulate any situation. Being a family doesn't entitle anyone to anything outside what is given out of free will (love, etc...).  Also, it's fair to not want to have to clean up after a wedding but you may want to have a safeguard in place in case they try to use the property behind your back.", "I'm torn between ESH and NTA.   They're wrong to just expect you to let them use your property, but also own up to your reasoning and don't blame grandpa.  Grandpa sounds a bit sexist and cousin sounds a bit trashy.  All around yuck.", "NTA. Some will take issue with the morality judgements you\u2019re using to justify your decision but for me all of that is irrelevant: it\u2019s your house = your decision, and that\u2019s the end of it.", "NTA, I would have gone the other way but this cousin and aunt didn't talk to you about the use of the house.  They just assumed they were entitled to use it.  I'm curious as to why you're allowing the family to have Christmas there while you're exiled. This is your house now, not theirs. In fact, it was never theirs, it was your grandparents' who bequeathed it to you alone.", "NTA. You set a boundary and offered a compromise (need to be asked, want to be compensated for the inconvenience). People shouldn't be making assumptions just because they're related to you. Have some freaking manners, y'all.", "Your house....your rule", "OP, this is your house now, not the \"family\" house anymore.

Your family feels very entitled to your place without any prior consent. Not cool and that behavior shouldn't be rewarded. However, there will be a price to pay for your stiff spine - disharmony forever more.", "NTA, I think.  Its your property, they did assume, and never asked.  You can allow who you want on it.  And it sounds like you have no issue losing a relationship with this cousin / aunt.  The way you talk about women in general though leave me squeamish (though this cousin in particular is problematic.  I also wouldn't host a wedding for two cheaters).   I think the she can pay to rent the space was a decent compromise.  \n\nI get your grandpa was an old guy \"of a different generation\" (Though I think that \"excuse\" is BS when they're living during a different generation).  But you using your grandpas \"older generation\" standards for the farm, when you weren't part of that older generation, and you are alive now is not the way.  Like....okay, grandpa had some problematic opinions, but he's gone now.  You can't say \"it used to be grandpas farm, so we're still going to follow those problematic opinions.\"  Don't host the wedding because you don't want to - and be upfront about that.

You only got the property because your grandfather is an asshole.  If he had \"done the right thing\" he'd have split the property up equally amongst his children.  Instead he excluded them because they're female and he didn't like their husbands.  Because of his backwards views, you benefitted more than any of the rest of your family.  Instead of being gracious and letting all your cousins (including this one) have their receptions there (which IMO is the _least_ you can do given all the rest of them probably got a pittance for inheritance), you are singling her out to exclude her because it's her 2nd marriage.  \n\nThe fact that your grandfather wouldn't have wanted that doesn't matter, because he's dead now and _frankly he sounds like a jerk_, at least in terms of _some_ of his views.

This was the family house, which my grandpa also built a giant garage on which my cousins have been using as a reception hall the last few years for their weddings. When my grandma died my grandpa and me started hanging more and I worked at the property since I was little. I am the only grandson he had. All my cousins on my moms side are girls. \n\nIn 2018 my grandpa passed away and I was left the property. This caused a bunch of drama amongst the family. But I know exactly why my grandpa did it. My grandpa was not a perfect person. He was very old fashioned. Hated divorce and was very traditional. His beliefs clashed with his daughters. He wanted to hand his farm down to a son. He didn\u2019t have any and none of my aunts married the type of dudes he liked. So I became the de facto option. My grandpa especially disliked how my aunts were in their relationships cause he preached commitment. That man loved and was loyal to my grandma. \n\nMy cousin (28F) is getting married this fall. I\u2019m at my parents house and my aunt goes \u201cwell the reception will be at the house\u201d. I told her nobody has talked to me yet. She said that since every other cousin had their reception there it should be a tradition. I said sure but they all asked me and I wanted them there. Her daughter didn\u2019t ask me and I don\u2019t support the wedding. \n\nIt\u2019s really legit reason. This is my cousins second wedding. I\u2019m not even close with her. We differ politically so I have her muted on social media. I didn\u2019t even know she was engaged. Me and this cousin hardly speak. Also this is her second marriage. She cheated on her first husband with this dude. Who was also married at the time. My grandpa would never approve of that or want that on his property. Also I would have to be involved in the set up and clean up if it\u2019s at the house. I don\u2019t care to sacrifice my time. If she wants to rent the property and my time. Then she can pay me a premium for the short notice. But I\u2019m not doing it for free. \n\nI explained this all to my aunt and my cousin. They both threw a fit and tried having my mom talk to me. She tried pulling the family card and a guilt trip about my cousin having no money. I said my cousin has no money because of her divorce. It\u2019s a sham wedding and her dad wouldn\u2019t support it and she knows that. There was a reason that her dad didn\u2019t trust the property to his own kids. I said all my other cousins have been good people so I was willing to help. But this cousin and aunt are rude. My mom said I won\u2019t be invited to Christmas most likely then. I said okay find another venue while you are at it (the house is the hangout spot for Christmas). My dad is calling me an AH but I need to a fair judgment. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Would you have even let her use the house if she asked? \n\nIt's kind of telling that you provide so many \"justifications\" to deny the wedding (gpa wouldn't have wanted it, the marriage is a sham, it would cost me money, i'm not close, etc etc.) It gives readers lots of superficial reasons to support your side. But the fact that you hosted so many other weddings for other family there gives me pause. Reading between the lines, I think you just are just judgemental towards the cousin and want to punish her. It doesn't matter what grandpa would have wanted, but it seems like you have no qualms about continuing his \"imperfect\" views (i.e. raging misogyny). So ESH\n\nYes it's technically your property and you can do what you want, and yes your cousin was awfully presumptive when they assumed they could use it, but it's not at all surprising that they are upset you are cutting them out of the family house over your personal opinions about someone's relationship. \n\nTBH I'm suspicious of the post in general, seems very similar to an older one but with a whole bunch of extra meaty bait for everyone to debate over.", "I\u2019m going with ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s not great that she had an affair but to call it a sham wedding is not great either. Your grandfather sounds like he was more than a touch misogynistic and you seem like you\u2019re happily following in his footsteps. I have a feeling the \u201cpolitical differences\u201d between you and your cousin is she\u2019s liberal and you\u2019re not.\n\nYour family made assumptions and that\u2019s not great either, but I don\u2019t think your reasoning is as legit as you think. It basically boils down to \u201cI don\u2019t like her\u201d. \n\nYou\u2019re free to do what you want with the property but you are going to have to deal with the repercussions. I hope you feel they were worth it.\n\nEDIT: The things you said were overly harsh. You basically shit all over your grandpa\u2019s kids and burned bridges you may not be able to replace.", "i\u2019m busy laughing at your mom uninviting you from christmas when she holds it at **your** house.", "ESH - Continuing the \"women are less than\" tradition.

You don't have to approve of her marriage or her cheating, but calling it a \"sham wedding\" and saying that your other cousins are \"good people\" is just plain rude. Adding that this is why your grandfather left it to you, because he couldn't trust them... just unnecessary. All of that makes you also an AH.\n\nAlthough I am curious about your mom's logic regarding uninviting you from Christmas when it's at your house?

I would say nta for not letting them use it without asking and possibly paying but definitely the AH for denying because it's her 2nd marriage. You said that 2nd marriage 3 times in your post. Feels like you added the part about her cheating to justify why a 2nd marriage is horrible in your eyes but the way it reads is that the cheating was secondary to the fact that this was the 2nd marriage and that is really your issue.", "Lmao so to get you to let them use the house for the wedding they tried to uninvite you from a party that they were planning on throwing at your house.", "ESH. Your cousin needed to speak to you and not assume the reception would be allowed on your property without having a conversation with you. Especially not with the assumption the venue, your time, and your labor would be free.\n\nThe property is yours to do with as your please. However it\u2019s only yours because your grandpa was being sexist with his will. He was also judging all his daughters relationships. Now you\u2019re following in his footsteps and refusing the venue because you don\u2019t approve of your female cousin\u2019s relationship. You could deny her for plenty of valid reasons listed above, so it\u2019s weird to me that you even admitted this. Again, it\u2019s your property and your right to deny her, but continuing the tradition of judging the women in your family is a bit too much. Turning this into a larger thing because it\u2019s your right to judge everyone is also too much. If your goal is to become exactly like your grandfather you\u2019re right on track.", "NTA", "NTA.

Hopefully you'll not have any issues.\n\nOn the other side though, you seem to be expecting others to live by your code of ethics and seem very judgemental regarding them.  You are within your rights to live by your ethics.  However, it is wrong to push those onto other people.  If your ethics say no gay marriage, that means YOU don't have a gay marriage.  That doesn't mean others can't.  Doing so makes you an asshole.", "YTA and your grandpa (and likely you too) is sexist and also an AH.

My grandparents were born in the 1910s/1920s and my parents were born in the 1940s so I was raised, 'old fashioned'. Him wanting to pass down his pride and joy to a boy, is no different than a grandmother passing down a necklace/ring to her daughter or granddaughter. Plus I'm sure his decision also came down to the fact that his daughters and granddaughters didn't help him on the property.", "NTA,\nAnyone who's trying to \"educate\" you on how to \"treat\" your family can pound sand.

I said okay find another venue while you are at it\"\n\nI think it's weird to say these people are \"good people\" without explaining how. You mention muting a cousin on social for different political affiliations, and you mention how your grandpa - seemingly kinda misogynistic - favored you (\"He wanted to hand his farm down to a son. **He didn\u2019t have any** and none of my aunts married the **type of dudes he liked**. So **I became the de facto option**\"). \n\nI have *a lot* of questions.\n\nHowever your mom did a weird thing by trying to up the ante with a threat; if you don't let them get married at your house, we won't invite you to Christmas ... which is also at your house?

It also sounds like your grandma and grandad got married in HS and he built enough space for her sisters, not even his blood - but his Love's loved ones. Fuck them for the whole assuming the wedding thing, but maybe have an annual cookout?", "NTA. As long as you\u2019re comfortable with what could be long term repercussions.

There are myriad other reasons you could reasonably not want to host a wedding on your property - heck, the liability alone would give me pause, not to mention the general aggravation. \n\nWhile you do sound a bit judgmental, 1. it doesn't sound like you like them very much to begin with and 2. your aunt and cousin were definitely disrespectful in their expectation of the use of your resources.

For example, all the other cousins had their weddings there but then you act like grandpa didn't approve of their relationships and wouldn't approve of their weddings... but he apparently did. Maybe your grandpa recognized the importance of family and confided in you but also allowed his family to use the property and didn't want you selfishly breaking up the family over his property and expected you to carry on the traditions.

It may have been sexist to give the only male the vast majority of the inheritence, but it avoided the issue of splitting up the property, which would have been useless for everyone but the buyers. I assume you couldn't afford to buy them out. \n\nIt wasn't fair to give the family business to one person based on capability or sex, but it was the only decision that maintained the family business. \n\nIt is not clear if your grandfather would have decided to boycott the wedding based on sexism or traditional values, but what you wrote suggests he would have likely made the same decision. \n\nI think it is perfectly resonable to boycott a wedding for personal reasons. The reason you give will decide if your family will accept or rebuff you. So far, it would seem the family you have spoken to doesn't like your decision but did not outright disagree with your argument. They appear to agree with your reasoning but dont like what it means. \n\nThe only reason your aunt and cousin are TA is for assuming you would agree to host. Otherwise, they would not be TA. No one would be TA if they had asked, and you said no.

I think your reasons are good enough. \n\nI would still favor the middle ground you somewhat suggested. They can use the venue, but they need to do the work and cleanup.

(Some would consider that supporting the infidelity). \n\nAnd when he has the audacity to not want to host this event, they try to bully him by excluding him from the family Christmas party (which is also hosted on his property). \n\nAll of that should be sufficient without adding his wanting to honour his grandfather wishes and not support a relationship based off infidelity (something his was greatly opposed too). \n\nHe\u2019s allowed other family to host their weddings there and clearly the Xmas party, so he\u2019s not being difficult with sharing it. \n\nEnd of the day, if someone I didn\u2019t like or get along with tried to bully me into using my property without my permission or prior knowledge I\u2019d have a problem with it too.", "If this is a farm, I'd be demanding payment too. Apart from the mess in the reception area, there may also be damage to lawns and driveways from all the cars. It sounds like OP would be left with the cleanup and the cleanup bill.", "Or maybe the women in the family: 1) weren't super keen on bonding time with someone judgemental and misogynistic (seriously, he only considered \"male heirs\"!) and 2) wouldn't have had much luck maintaining the property because of grandpa's \"traditional views\" ('farmer's wives' do the laundry, make the food, collect the eggs, they don't do men's work!)  \n\n\nIt's honestly astounding to see people trying to blame the daughters for their dad's general assholery.", "There's a chance the Grandpa had more than just his property to give away in death. The women could've gotten money, etc, it could just be that OP got the biggest and most expensive thing his Grandpa had to give.\n\nWe have no proof the women were completely disinherited from everything following his Grandpa's death, people are just assuming as such.", "> Maybe the cousin should have asked first before assuming that the wedding would be on the farm. \n\nForget that, she didn\u2019t even tell OP she was engaged..", "I think people just wanna make that choice about misogyny and sexism but in actual fact OP is the obvious choice given his relationship with his Grandpa and the fact he's the only one willing to respect his property as if he were still alive.", "My grandparents had property they bought when I was very little. I was there ALL the time (weekends, evenings, any time i could get myself out there, really) and was the only grandchild or child who helped build; I'm in every piece of fence and building out there now. \n\nWhen my grandma died, my grandpa moved into a different place and let my mom have the farm. She never drove one fucking nail, dug up a single thistle, or planted one fence post. Never! I was PISSED. \n\nThen she sold it. Yeah, I'm still pretty pissed over that.", "I'd at least talk to the property owner if I plan a massive party there", "Tell it.", "Grandpa didn't like any of their husbands was the other reason", "Hahahaha I think a this point it\u2019s important for you to know, that it\u2019s 7:39 AM where I live\u2026 just so you know where my brain\u2018s at\ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s 12:45am here. This is my adhd brain on the daily cuz i don\u2019t sleep \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "With a LED light, to make one of those special effect pictures with the trace of the light\ud83d\ude02\nYou get points for a perfect circle!", "I woke up at 1 am b/c my cats had the zoomies \ud83d\ude02"]}
