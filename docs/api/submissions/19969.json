We were all at an event and got home at different times. When I got home, I used my bathroom and saw what she did. She\u2019s done it before so I knew to check my son\u2019s room. He had come home and left again by the time I got there. I saw a couple wrappers and a pantyliner on his floor so I picked them up and cleaned his floor. As I was leaving his room, I glanced at his trash and saw a bunch more wrappers and liners. He\u2019d cleaned up the others and just missed the couple I saw. So, my 18 yo son had to clean up a bunch of chewed up panty liners. I was absolutely horrified. He hasn\u2019t said a single word to me about it. \n\nI suspect your mom was embarrassed.

I would feel weird and gross about leaving panty liners face down anywhere in the bathroom that only I use, although I might put them down face up temporarily if the situation called for it.\n\nParents get used to a lot of gross things with children and I think that can come to include a certain laziness when it comes to unexpectedly shared bodily fluids in both directions. Further, families live so closely together that it is extremely unlikely that this behaviour of hers is likely to infect you with anything that you wouldn't be exposed to by other means. That doesn't make it okay.\n\nAYTA for objecting to this behaviour? not at all. But for yelling at her?

Your mother got upset because she feels shame on what she is doing.  Have her bring this behavior up to the other women in her life, they will all find it gross, just like me.  Used panty liners belong in the trash, not where you possibly put your makeup or other items that you regularly touch through the day or even use on your face.

As a woman, I apologize for any woman who tells you differently.  Anyone who doesn't immediately put used ANYTHING in a trash can is disgusting.
