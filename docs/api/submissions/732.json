Carol became offended and asked Bob to not send that kind of stuff, including what was allegedly advances by Bob. Adam was informed of the exchange and sent a long letter to Bob in an attempt to find out why he did it. Bob has not responded. \n\nEDIT I'm a third-party in this exchange. None of the issue involved me until Adam wanted me to pick sides.\n\nWhere do I come in? I'm the best friend and this happened in private messages between the three of them. Adam seems to think since I refuse to openly declare Bob as a martyr and remove him from our collective group message between our group of 20 other friends who all get along, that I've declared my stance to support Bob. I've explained to Adam that I don't think Bob was in the right, but it's not my place to remove Bob from our group over a situation between the three of them. The issue remained unresolved but was not an issue until Adam felt the others were siding with Bob, who has said nothing about the incident to anyone. \n\nNo one else in the group knew about any issues until Adam made a big deal over it to everyone in an effort to gain support. No one responded. Adam has since left the group message while Carol remains in but silent. The group has spoken once about it and all agree it's not anyone's responsibility to choose who stays or goes except those three. Bob shared his side of the story to the group and no one wanted to get involved.\n\nAITA for \"not declaring my undying allegiance\" to Adam for a situation he has failed to pursue to its conclusion? I supported his view of how if everything said was true that Bob was in the wrong, but refuse to be the one to remove Bob from the group. I've tried to step away for months and it keeps being brought up when Adam feels no one is supporting him in avenues no one else in the group even includes themselves in. Adam or Carol will message me in casual conversation and then eventually bring it up.

Whatever this shit show is, is their business. \nIf this story makes my head hurt; Ican't imagine how you feel. Did you end up on an episode of Degrassi? \n\nNTA", "NTA you don't have to \"cancel\" Bob because he slighted Adam.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with you and they need to stop trying to drag you into it.", "To anyone's knowledge, no. Carol said Bob sent over pictures of fan art that was inappropriate and made a comment that she took his him making a move. Adam responded aggressively and wanted to know why Bob sent anything to her at all. It was learned later that Bob and Adam has a previous beef with each other that they supposedly squashed.\n\nBefore this exchange, Bob and Carol were getting along great. We often hang out together.", "Definitely not a harassment thing at all. Bob and Carol were friends before this happened.\nFrom what Adam and Carol both said at the time, Bob sent the artwork based on a conversation he was having with Carol in which he took something said as a mutual kink. It was not. He apologized immediately for it.", "Man, I feel like I'm on an episode of Springer.

Have you seen them? Do you know how inappropriate they were?\n\nEdit: updated with judgment. \n\n\nNTA", "Sounds like a misunderstanding. I don't understand why Carol and Adam won't let it go.
