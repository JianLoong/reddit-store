It is not.  If you have a problem with what he does you shouldn't gang up on him in public and try to shame him into changing things.  That just makes you an asshole.  If this is a serious issue for you then break up with him because he doesnt seem like he is going to change and its his choice.  His \"bad\" behavior does not excuse your bad behavior.

In return you make yourself look good, because you chose someone who's... You guessed it, good.\n\nNow you made him look like a jerk, and people will think of him as a jerk, and they will also think of you as a jerk who shouldn't be together with a jerk.\n\nSo if your intention was to publicly show that you don't actually like your boyfriend, you succeeded.\n\nYTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are 100% correct, these people work hard and rely on tips to live.

When servers see they make good money from tips, they don\u2019t give a single fudge about abolishing tipping wages. They\u2019d rather customers pay them more than the employer paying them fairly. Societal change doesn\u2019t come from doing exactly what society wants you to do. \n\nSorry for the tangent. It\u2019s admirable you think you\u2019re doing the servers a favour, but seriously think about what you\u2019re doing when you do that.

I am actually still surprised people take those serving jobs with the less than minimum.  You can work fast food and make more than minimum in some cases.  Either the servers know they make more or don\u2019t have many other options.  To each their own.  I have said it in another post that I only tip wait staff and above and beyond people.  I also only tip wait staff based on performance.  If I am picking up take out then no tip,  sit down and get generic service then you get 10% of pre tax bill.  Crappy service gets less and above generic gets more.  10% is my baseline not 20%.

How about: people refuse to eat out at restaurants that don't pay a living wage? That would solve the problem and wouldn't require you to ruin someone's livelihood. But that's inconvenient, it's much easier to force someone else to pay the cost of your morality.", "That\u2019s a great plan on paper but it isn\u2019t gonna work. \n\n\nIt\u2019s also punishing the servers in the vain hope of making the restaurant business model change.", "He\u2019s getting hate for a very valid reason", "I certainly don't. Neither does anyone I know unless the service is above and beyond. Maybe I don't eat at those types of places? \n\nI'm up north of that makes any difference. I expect my bill to be priced correctly by a competent business owner that factors in overheads and staffing.", "Lmao he just paid the owners for a full meal, he's already paying greedy owners. What a dumb excuse.", "So you're going to punish the underpaid staff by not paying them a necessary part of their earnings?? That's bullshit and a totally harmful way of protesting how costs are structured in American/ Canadian restaurants across the board.\n\nIf OP doesn't want to tip, he can try to find a restaurant that prohibits tipping while paying a liveable wage.

You\u2019d have to tripe your prices and you\u2019d have no customers.  Tipping is good for everyone", "Australian here. This really does depend on where you're eating and what the service is like. We absolutely do not have the same kind of tipping requirements / culture as the US, but if I've gone out for an expensive meal and the service is above and beyond, I absolutely will tip, and that's the case for many people.

The servers (waitstaff) share their tips with the bar staff who makes the drinks for their table (in some instances, the chef too) and the floor/ restaurant manager.\n\nTip outs are super common here. Definitely not to the managers, that's illegal. But 2% of sales to bar and 2% of sales to kitchen is basically standard. \n\nSo if you spend $100 before taxes and leave a zero tip, you actually take $4 from the server as they have to pay out 4% of their sales. I'm pretty sure it's also illegal to pull tip out on a zero tipped bill but many workers don't know their rights or just feel they have to put up with it.", "How about servers push for living wages instead of tips?", ">Ahh so in the short term you exploit the servers by not tipping\n\nYou call it exploit, I call it social progress.

Do you think two million alternate jobs are suddenly going to be available for those two million people to take? Or are you relying on the utter fantasy that restarant managers would immediately understand what was happening  and immediately revise their entire budget and pricing? The entire economy would crash while we waited for restaurant managers to figure out and execute a game plan. Many of those restaurants would never reopen.", "There is no tipping culture. There are no tipping requirements. At all. \n\nIf you are at an expensive restaurant and choose to you can and I have. That is not the day to day experience of eating out. I even gave an example.\n\nAnd unless you are a wanker running a cafe in Byron Bay trying to rip off tourists, it's not an expectation in Australia. At all. \n\nAnd it's because of the industrial relations culture, solid aversion to wage theft, and a cultural approach to having adequate minimum wages. \n\nBut you already know this.

Impossible to live off of.", "What about other people providing a service to you?

Plenty of restaurants that pay their staff more than 1.37 an hour, and many that are paying significantly more than that.", "They do not. Cruel, inhumane and completely unnecessary.", "It\u2019s a lot harder and more expensive to get to that point than it is to become a server though. \n\nThe money isn\u2019t comparable but neither is the entry barrier", "I'm sure they're making more. I'm just saying servers make huge money here. I'd honestly say too much.", "You\u2019re right, but not tipping wait staff doesn\u2019t fix that. I fully agree with not tipping for things like fast food, but if you go to a sit down restaurant with dedicated wait staff then you need to plan on tipping. It\u2019s as simple as that", "If that's your stance, that's fine, but then you don't go and avail yourself of the labor of those not being paid properly and support the owners who don't pay their staff. If you truly feel that way then you vote with your dollar and only eat at establishments where three servers are paid a fair liveable wage.", "That\u2019s a great long term goal. In the meantime, though, saying \u201cit\u2019s not my problem you make no money, why should I tip you?\u201d but still choosing to eat out at restaurants is indicative of somebody being a smug selfish asshole.", "Sure but that doesn't single out servers.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I always tip servers. But the person serving you and 50 other people an hour at Tim Hortons or scanning groceries at the checkout is also making an unlivable minimum wage and they don't get 15-20% tips.", "1.37 isn't legal in the US. Not one state in the US is that legal.", "Hairdressers you tip.", "Too much? Oh fuck off", "A lot of states are voting to get rid of the sub minimum wage (the wage that servers make in most states) and also raising the minimum wage to make it more livable. You can vote for and support these changes if you want to do something. However, not tipping in states with sub minimum wages is not helping at all.", "We could fix the system by refusing to participate in it, meaning not visit restaurants that don't pay their staff a liveable wage. Most Americans are too selfish to do that, though. Can't give up your favorite pasta or whatever. If we all actually stopped visiting places whose values don't align with our own, we could actually create change. \n\nThere are some restaurants near me that finally started paying much higher wages to get employees after COVID and I visit them more than the others that clearly haven't raised wages. The level of service is markedly better at these places. I still tip a minimum of 20% too because it's still standard and expected.", "Actually it would if people didn\u2019t accept the job. Eventually the owner would have to pay an actual wage to attract someone to taking the job", "You think serving food to rich people deserves more money than EMTs?", "Fair enough. Thanks for the information. I'm glad to hear progress is moving in the right direction and I understand why. Just a different culture and social etiquette I guess.", "Exactly. People don't realize that wait staff would all quit if we stopped tipping. Then the restaurant owners would be forced to pay a proper wage. It really is that simple.", "You think EMT salaries and waiter pay comes out of the same budget? They could both stand to make much more.", "Where did I say that? Oh yea, I didn\u2019t. Again, just fuck off."]}
