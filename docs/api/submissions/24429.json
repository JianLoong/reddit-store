But thats not the question here:  the question is whether you verbally calling out your boyfriend in the restaurant to shame him into doing something you know he doesnt want to and wont do is appropriate.  It is not.  If you have a problem with what he does you shouldn't gang up on him in public and try to shame him into changing things.  That just makes you an asshole.  If this is a serious issue for you then break up with him because he doesnt seem like he is going to change and its his choice.  His \"bad\" behavior does not excuse your bad behavior.

In return you make yourself look good, because you chose someone who's... You guessed it, good.\n\nNow you made him look like a jerk, and people will think of him as a jerk, and they will also think of you as a jerk who shouldn't be together with a jerk.\n\nSo if your intention was to publicly show that you don't actually like your boyfriend, you succeeded.\n\nYTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are 100% correct, these people work hard and rely on tips to live.

NTA", "YTA. Sorry just my personal views on tipping conflict with this. I believe continuing to tip only fuels the problem of a tipping wage. When servers see they make good money from tips, they don\u2019t give a single fudge about abolishing tipping wages. They\u2019d rather customers pay them more than the employer paying them fairly. Societal change doesn\u2019t come from doing exactly what society wants you to do. \n\nSorry for the tangent. It\u2019s admirable you think you\u2019re doing the servers a favour, but seriously think about what you\u2019re doing when you do that. Also trying to publicly shame someone into doing what you want is never the move. Notice how you apologized immediately when he got upset?

I am actually still surprised people take those serving jobs with the less than minimum.  You can work fast food and make more than minimum in some cases.  Either the servers know they make more or don\u2019t have many other options.  To each their own.  I have said it in another post that I only tip wait staff and above and beyond people.  I also only tip wait staff based on performance.  If I am picking up take out then no tip,  sit down and get generic service then you get 10% of pre tax bill.  Crappy service gets less and above generic gets more.  10% is my baseline not 20%.

Are you really degrading OPs post and the conversation over server minimum wage because inflation may have jumped it from 1.37 to 2.13\u2026.? Really? Well we can also get into opportunity exemptions for people under 20 in certain states (that allow even lower federal minimum wage) and that some states allow for partial re-crediting of that 2.13 with earned tips.  So that would make that state server minimum wage possibly 0.", "I'd say Its about 50/50 at this point which is improvement\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped\n\nNearly the entire Midwest is using the federal min tip wage of $2.13 still"]}
