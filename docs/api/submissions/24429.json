It is not.  If you have a problem with what he does you shouldn't gang up on him in public and try to shame him into changing things.  That just makes you an asshole.  If this is a serious issue for you then break up with him because he doesnt seem like he is going to change and its his choice.  His \"bad\" behavior does not excuse your bad behavior.

In return you make yourself look good, because you chose someone who's... You guessed it, good.\n\nNow you made him look like a jerk, and people will think of him as a jerk, and they will also think of you as a jerk who shouldn't be together with a jerk.\n\nSo if your intention was to publicly show that you don't actually like your boyfriend, you succeeded.\n\nYTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are 100% correct, these people work hard and rely on tips to live.

NTA", "YTA. Sorry just my personal views on tipping conflict with this. I believe continuing to tip only fuels the problem of a tipping wage. When servers see they make good money from tips, they don\u2019t give a single fudge about abolishing tipping wages. They\u2019d rather customers pay them more than the employer paying them fairly. Societal change doesn\u2019t come from doing exactly what society wants you to do. \n\nSorry for the tangent. It\u2019s admirable you think you\u2019re doing the servers a favour, but seriously think about what you\u2019re doing when you do that. Also trying to publicly shame someone into doing what you want is never the move. Notice how you apologized immediately when he got upset?

I am actually still surprised people take those serving jobs with the less than minimum.  You can work fast food and make more than minimum in some cases.  Either the servers know they make more or don\u2019t have many other options.  To each their own.  I have said it in another post that I only tip wait staff and above and beyond people.  I also only tip wait staff based on performance.  If I am picking up take out then no tip,  sit down and get generic service then you get 10% of pre tax bill.  Crappy service gets less and above generic gets more.  10% is my baseline not 20%.

If you are also required to tip out, bartender, busser, barback, etc... the extra goes real quick. \n\n\nI personally could not date someone who doesn't tip, and then is so embarrassed that they don't tip they hide it from others.", "That's not true in the US. 99.999999% of restaurants do not adhere to this standard", "I\u2019m an Australian so never really had to deal with tipping but wouldn\u2019t it make sense to pay flat rate and then pay commission on to if the server keeps regulars coming back", "No tipping, no dick snips. The western world outside of north America really is a great place \ud83e\udd23", "When you tip via the card machine that money didn't legally have to go to the server, and it rarely does. Tip cash (at least in England, the rest of the UK could be different).", "A whopping $10 an hour? What are the the wait staff going to do with all that money?", "\u2b06\ufe0fThis!! I waitressed for years when I was younger. Made $2.13/hr. Days that were busy and tips average out it was great. Slow days not so much. Never once did ANY restaurant I worked for make up the difference!! Unfortunately back then I didn't know they were supposed to.", "None of the ones I ever worked for. I made $2.51 an hour and worked my ass of trying to make tips. OP\u2019s boyfriend sucks. I\u2019d have called him out directly rather than making it an \u201ceverybody\u201d statement.", "A friend of mine worked through a temp agency doing outdoors groundskeeper type stuff for local councils, including using herbicide on all the weeds. She lodged a complaint because the tanks of herbicide were leaking dangerous chemicals onto the workers. \n\nThe temp agency pulled her from that job with the promise to put her somewhere safer, and then never spoke to her again. \n\nCasual workers don't get to complain about illegal practices if they want to keep working.", "it\u2019s a mom and pop my local so it does go to them and their adult kids who work there, I do cash sometimes elsewhere", "It didn't cost you money. You only think it cost you money because you counted all the tips you collected as yours when really you were collecting them on behalf of you and your coworkers."]}
