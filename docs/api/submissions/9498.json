You and your sister can make the choice to get away from your abuser.\n\nNTA.", ">\"What can I do? She chose to marry him, I never chose to have him as my father\".\n\nYour sister is 100% correct. Your mom chose to marry someone who is abusive and chose to stay with him, for her own reasons. While I have sympathy for your mother, her bad choices don't mean that you and your sister also have to suffer abuse for her. Your sister being home just means that your father has more targets for his abuse. It certainly isn't protecting your mom. NTA.", "NTA, it really sounds like your dad is an abusive narcissist and your mom is an enabler. Good for you for taking your sister in so she can escape that very unhealthy situation. Your mom shouldn\u2019t be using her high blood pressure as a means to get people to do what she wants, that\u2019s a bit manipulative, you are not betraying her.", "NTA. Stick with your sister and make sure to help her do all the things your father never let her. Get her proper pain medication for her period and show her how awesome life is when you\u2019re not living with an asshole father.", "YWNBTA.  Your sister is right.  Your mother chose to marry him and stay with him, and continues to choose to stay with him.  Your sister needs to escape and thankfully she can come live with you.  Did your mom expect that you guys would never leave?  She had to know this day was coming, and that the kids would leave home.", "Not an asshole by any stretch of the imagination. Will the creep come around and mess with you two? Are you safe from that? If your mom does finally leave would you be able/willing to take her in? I\u2019m seriously rooting for the three of you", "NTA.  Your mom chooses to stay in an unhealthy situation.  That is a choice for her and her alone, and it is wrong for your mom to try to impose the consequences of her choice on her children.  That is, frankly, selfish. \n\nYour sister does NOT have to chose to stay in that situation.  She is not an AH for leaving.  You are not an AH for giving her a place to go. \n\nAs a mother, I would want my child to leave for a better situation, not guilt them to stay with me because I am worried about the consequences of a choice I made for myself.", "NTA\n\nI'd tell my mother if she wants companionship she can stay with me, but dad is not welcome, and make sure he stays away if she chooses it.\n\nIf she wants to stay with him, well her choice", "NTA- this is a difficult situation but you are not at fault for providing your sister an opportunity to escape emotional abuse at your fathers hands. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for escaping the situation either by moving out. I would say try to spend time with your mom and your sister as much as possible out of the house, and hopefully your mom will start to realize what an unhealthy living situation she is in.", "INFO: Why can\u2019t you take your mom in as well? I understand she\u2019s worried about your father and living alone may not work, but would that be an option?\n\nAs for taking your sister in, absolutely NTA. Take care of your siblings. It\u2019s hard to convince women in abusive relationships to leave, but all you can really do is support your mom in whatever decision she makes and let her know your door is always open too if she chooses (and if that is a viable option for you).", "NTA. Your mom is an adult making decisions for herself that aren\u2019t good decisions-you can\u2019t fix that, but you can help your sister have a better and less stressful life, so do that.", "NTA", "NTA, but can you look into shelters for domestic abuse for your mom?", "So the answer to your mom\u2019s blood pressure and concerns about being alone is to make a 17 year old responsible for them? No. Your mom is only 53 and could live a few more decades yet. Your sister deserves her life. NTA", "NTA to help your sister leave that house as soon as she is legally allowed to.  Your mother has chosen to stay where & how she is but she should not be enabled to trap her youngest daughter as her companion.", "NTA\n\nAt 29 you have absolutely no obligation to help anyone else in your family for any reason. And instead of turning your back on any of them you are choosing to help the one who is asking for it, your sister. Your mother has already refused it. Just like you would want to make your own decisions, you need to let her make her own. Now, as I saw in one of your replies, if your mother asks for help you are still allowed to put restrictions on that help, like her completely removing her husband from the equation.\n\nGood luck and good work helping your little sis out.", "INFO: Your Mum's concerns about leaving your father are valid.
