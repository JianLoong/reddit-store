Four years ago, my parents went out of town for the night, and I (21F) went to my cousin\u2019s bachelorette and didn\u2019t get home until 11-ish.

I admit, I didn\u2019t scream, but I was really scared for a few minutes as he talked about his ex, told me how pretty I was, and that we should \u201chave some fun\u201d. After I got over the shock, I got up and said that I wanted to show him something in the kitchen. He followed, then I locked the puppy gate we had at the time for our dog, separating him from the bedrooms, knowing he was too drunk to open it. I told my brother the next day, and he didn\u2019t seem to care. I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of nothing, so I didn\u2019t tell my parents.\n\nWhich brings us to yesterday, when Adam and my brother were on the kitchen while I helped my mom with supper. Adam was talking about buying a new bed with his girlfriend, and asked me where I got my mattress, because it was very comfortable. Our mom was really confused as to when he was on my bed, and Adam got really quiet, and quickly left the house. I told her (as casually as possible) what had happened that night, and she got really angry and called my father on his way home from work. They have now since banned him from coming near the house, and my dad threatened him. \n\nAmong other names, my brother called me an asshole for \u2018making such a big deal out of it\u2019.

Adam does not need to be a guest in your home, considering his recent behaviors and were you guys my kids, I'd tell my son flat out that he can keep Adam as a friend but, doing so makes me think less of him. \"Who defends and dismisses such predatory behavior? Fix you and you fix the problem son.\"\n\nTell your brother the truth: *You don't see what Adam did as predatory because it did not happen to you. And you doubting this is predatory behavior makes you a huge a-hole. Creeping and pawing at me while I'm trying to sleep is not normal behavior for anyone.

I'm not surprised by your parents' reaction, hopefully they will make it clear to your brother that behaviour like that is completely unacceptable and definitely a big deal.\n\nPart of me wonders if Adam bought up the mattress on purpose to make you uncomfortable or see your reaction.", "NTA - Adam's behaviour is *creepy* as fuck.\n\nMoreover, your brother's well out of line if he thinks you're \"making a big deal of it\". Adam told on himself by asking you where you got the mattress, you only filled in the blanks for your parents (thinking there was nothing wrong with it), and they're the ones who said that Adam (rightly) needs to stay the fuck away from their house.\n\nYou are *not* the asshole here.

Besides, he stupidly ratted himself out.", "NTA. And your dad is a fucking legend!", "he remembered what your bed felt like four years later? despite having been drunk? thata creepy. and I suspect he's thought about that night *a lot* and not in a 'i'm ashamed of my actions' kind of way.

Also, Adam knows he did a Bad Thing - thus he felt rightful shame when your mom questioned him - why does your brother not get it? \n\nYour parents did the sane, protective, right thing to do - what matters are Adam's actions and his intentions, and he demonstrated that he is untrustworthy and potentially dangerous.", "NTA.\n\nThat \"friend\" of your brother is facing the consequences of his actions. You are not responsible for this in any way.\n\nWhat if in a few years there's another young female in the house, and he gets drunk and does this again?

You could\u2019ve been SA\u2019d by Adam, and your brother is mad at you because you told your mom? What the fuck?", "He\u2019s a predator, and your brother at least an enabler.

I assumed they were the ages at the time of the incident bc 17 year olds don't often go to bachelor parties, but then why on earth is a 24 year old upset about his friend getting banned from his parents' house? Are him and his friend just jobless losers?", "NTA- and I would tell brother \n\n1) I did not make a big deal, although in retrospect I probably should have- your friend crawled into my bed and tried to have sex with me.\n\n2)Do not blame me for what he did or for how others feel about it.\n\n3)I now know that you do not support me- thank you for letting me know this so I will not ever turn to you in need.", "NTA.  However, your family should be concerned about your brother.  Even Adam realized what he did was wrong, but your brother's reaction was to get mad at you for telling your parents the truth.  Your brother's lack of reaction to you telling him about Adam's behavior makes me wonder if this has gone on before and your brother is aware of it.  This shows a shocking lack of empathy.  There is a real possibility that Adam's girlfriend will find out about this (your parents are likely to warn their friends about Adam), so you should prepare yourself for future attacks from your brother.  Good luck and stay safe.  Please update us to let everyone know that you are alright.", "NTA. that was sexual assault.", "Your sibling\u2019s brother card has been revoked.", "NTA and that guy AND your brother can  fuck right off. \n\nDrunk or not, that behavior was not ok at all, and I\u2019m glad you were quick on your feet and got away from him.", "Your brother is the asshole, along with is turd of a friend. Drunkenness excuses nothing.", "NTA. What Adam did was violating and wrong. You have no idea what he would have done if you hadn't come up with that idea to safely get him out of your room. And being drunk is no excuse for him.\n\nYour brother is an AH for siding with his creepy friend and not wanting to protect his sister.

Feels like it was some kind of weird power play that he didn\u2019t think through.\n\nEither way, I think what he did absolutely warrants cutting him off from the family and your brother sucks for maintaining a relationship with that guy.", "NTA, from the way you describe it you didn't even bring it up, Adam ratted himself out. \n\nYou should ask your brother if Adam had of raped you, if that would have been enough to \"make a big deal about it\". Gross behavior on Adam and your brother.", "NTA and you should make sure to tell your parents that your brother knew about this and didn't think it was a big deal.

He's probably done it to someone else too.", "NTA, your brother is AH. You parents are awesome, they called the sexual harassment out and removed the predator from your home.

Are you 21 now, so you were a 17 year old MINOR CHILD when this happened or were you 21 then, and 25 now?\n\nEither way, not your fault, still NTA.

That can't possibly have been the only time he creeped on OP, it was just the time he was drunk enough to not be able to stop himself from being blatantly creepy.", "Exactly. What he did 4 years ago was predatory. There's no way he would remember the quality of her mattress unless he's been holding on to that drunk memory in his spank bank that whole time or he's been in her bed more frequently than that.\n\nTBH, I think his 'slip' yesterday was creepy too. The most forgiving explanation I can come up with he wanted her mom and brother to think they'd slept together. More likely he wanted OP to know that he would be thinking of her while laying in a bed he bought with his girlfriend. It's wrong to include someone in your kink like that without explicit consent, especially when you've already violated their consent in the past, especially if you're going to say that in front of their parents. It's good that he's experiencing consequences for that.", "They do often support/cover for each other don\u2019t they. I\u2019m looking at you Ashton Kutcher.", "Bazinga. If I had gold to give you on the last day that it's worth anything I would.\n\nOP did nothing wrong. And I am so grateful that it did not end worse for them. That person does not need to be invited back in your home ever again.\n\nYour brother is an inmature jerk.", "I can\u2019t get over his decision to make that remark, whether or not he actually remembered what the mattress felt like. It\u2019s like he was eager to remind OP about what happened, so much so that he forgot her mother was there.\n\nSober or drunk, I think this man likes to make sexual advances on people who\u2019ve shown no interest. I think it\u2019s safest for everyone for that to be widely known, despite OP\u2019s brother\u2019s efforts.", "I'll never get over him laughing in that old talkshow clip about Danny Masterson daring/bribing him with $20 to French kiss Mila at all, let alone while she was like 14 and had never kissed anyone before \ud83e\udd22", "There is no power on earth that would make me not side with my sister after finding out my best friend creeped into her room \"drunk\" at 17-18.\n\nNah Bro. How was OP cursed with such a flagrantly useless sibling?", "You're a good Sib!"]}
