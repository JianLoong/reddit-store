You\u2019re intentionally stunting his education, under the guise of being concerned because of his autism. You\u2019re allowing a diagnosis to tell you what he is capable of, rather than what he has proven to be capable of. As his parent, you should be his biggest champion in getting him where he needs to be to excel. \n\nPurposely stunting him due to his diagnosis is ableist and infantilizing him.", ">However, I really miss him and I am also concerned that due to his autism, his behavior might not be good, so I decided to keep him with me due to me knowing better about autism than other relatives and not send him to relatives house even if the schools there rank higher, are feeder schools to Harvard and MIT, and have a better learning environment for my son.\n\n\"These schools are better for him, he'd feel good there but I'm not going to send him there because I miss him and I don't believe in him\" : why are you sabotaging your own son ?\n\n>I argue with him that he doesn't deserve to and instead, has to deal with public school that gives my son an inferior educational environment\n\nWhy are you mentally torturing your son ? Do you hate him ?\n\n>He also became jealous of his cousin as well\n\nSomething we didn't see coming at all.\n\nYou should wish your son the best instead of being his enemy and depriving him of opportunities. You think your son isn't good enough, I wonder what he'd say about you as a parent. You're parenting wrong, wake up before your son cuts you out of his life.\n\nEdit : I forgot to mention that YTA.", "I guess YTA, but your writing feels like you might be the 5th grader\u2013if so, sorry your mom is ruining your future kid, and I hope you run as far from her as you can get as soon as you turn 18 because this type of smothering toxic parenting will end up taking a lot more from you than just your education over the long run.", "YTA and a huge one at that. From what I can gather, the only thing your son did wrong was being diagnosed with autism, and you've let his life devolve into a shit show ever since. As if all the trouble he's been through isn't enough, you go out of your way to get your niece into his dream school. Do you hate your son? Because it sure sounds like it...", "Yeah YTA. Just because your scared he won\u2019t be able to manage his autism, or you\u2019ll miss him too much, doesn\u2019t give you the right to ROB him of an amazing opportunity! Especially when he\u2019s so enthusiastic about it! As a parent you have to make tough choices that may not always be the easiest but will benefit your kids future! This would be an amazing opportunity for him to get a little independents. Kids on the spectrum struggle to do things for themselves mostly because the parent hovers over them and tries to do everything for them so they don\u2019t learn to do things themselves. There are lots of ways to check in and make sure he\u2019s settled in and adjusts alright. He doesn\u2019t have to be sheltered just because it\u2019s the \u201ceasier\u201d way.", "YTA\n\nFor some unknown-to-me reason, you seem to favor your niece's educational needs over your son's. This is very strange to me. Perhaps it's a cultural difference or something, since you mentioned in a comment that you are an immigrant. And you talk about how smart your son is and then put him intentionally into a situation where he's treated as though he's not smart at all. It makes no sense.\n\nI don't blame him for going NC with you. Given that he has options, why would he want to live with you when you have no respect for his dreams and place him in such an untenable educational situation? Why would you want him to be in a school where he's bullied? Why would you not want him to have the best?! \n\nYou need to stop putting your needs and wants ahead of his. The size of your house, brand of car you drive, and size of your bank account are less important than supporting the education and dreams of your son. Good grief.", "So you think getting to ride in cool cars and tech stuff makes up for him being robbed of a higher education and independence? What about the part where he\u2019s being bullied at school for being in special Ed classes? Or the fact that your sons too smart for the regular classes meaning the special Ed classes are doing NOTHING to stimulate his mind. Which will lead to more tantrums and lashing out. Or maybe he\u2019ll see no point in striving for the top anymore because you\u2019ll just buy him something to keep him entertained\u2026you just need to think of how this is going to affect his future. I know it\u2019s hard to think something like this could cause such a big impact but it really can", "Huge YTA.

How would forcing your son to give up his dreams, so you can \u201chang\u201d out with him, be good for *him*? Punishing him for going nc with you and your wife isn\u2019t going to make him a better son. His jealousy of his cousin is very likely incited by things you intentionally do to make him jealous. You\u2019re a terrible father. Your actions are selfish and punitive, yet you expect gratitude from the victim of your actions?\n\nYou do know your son won\u2019t always be powerless, right?

It's not fair to give your niece the opportunity to attend a school that could help her reach her dreams while denying your son the same opportunity and sending him to an inferior educational setting, especially when you are aware of his condition and how it affects him.

He has won a math award, a regional engineering award, as well as win the school's Geography Bee. My niece (14F) meanwhile is an above average student and while she is very smart and a high achiever, she is not as smart as my son and plus, she doesn't have a strong desire to attend Ivy League, instead, dreaming of attending a less selective state school in another state where her older sister went, and she came all the way from China.\n\nHowever, I made the big mistake of sending my son to an inferior educational setting that not only removed him from advanced math class (a class he loved to be at his old school (pretend he is in 1st grade, that means 2nd grade math), he was also put in a special ed homeroom and special ed classes due to autism and early this year, he learned 6th grade math at half the pace of regular students despite the fact he had knowledge of Algebra and Geometry by the time. Not only that, due to his special ed status, he was also bullied by classmates and harassed by school administrators and police as they reprimanded him despite the fact he behaved well at school, and with all of these horrible school events early this year, he was traumatized and is now meeting a psychologist while cutting contact from both me and my wife after we sent him over to relatives. He is now an online school student and due to his fast pace, he is now starting 8th grade as well as Geometry/Algebra II.\n\nMy niece meanwhile, got the help from both my older sister and I to get sent to this 50k private school which is a feeder school to Harvard and other Ivy League schools, which is a school my son really wanted me to send him to. I do have the money to send him there and this school is also near relatives house (his grandparents live about 5 miles from the school). However, I really miss him and I am also concerned that due to his autism, his behavior might not be good, so I decided to keep him with me due to me knowing better about autism than other relatives and not send him to relatives house even if the schools there rank higher, are feeder schools to Harvard and MIT, and have a better learning environment for my son.\n\nAfter my son heard that his cousin got to attend a secondary school that my son has always wanted to attend while I argue with him that he doesn't deserve to and instead, has to deal with public school that gives my son an inferior educational environment, my son then threw temper tantrums at me as he is very resentful that I gave his education away to somebody who wouldn't benefit from that education.

He felt really uncomfortable and he was also dropped out of advanced math, meaning he had to repeat 6th grade math despite the fact he got an A+ in 2021-2 school year in 6th grade math, while at the same time, learning at half the pace.\n\nI am more concerned about his behavior because he was flapping his hands and walking on his toes when he was 5-7 and plus, he makes weird noises and is very silly.

This isn't the 50's. He's on this earth because he was born. We dont abandon or kill people just because we don't love them.\n\nThis is either beyond fake or you're absolutely a horrible parent.

Aren\u2019t you teaching him exactly why he shouldn\u2019t rely on *your* generosity? Sounds to me like you have an exceptionally bright child you\u2019re working tirelessly to outsmart.

He was influenced by Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg to get into Harvard and that is why he has been nagging us to send him to Boston.", "He is the only person in the family to have autism. Also, I tried to ask the school to remove him from special ed but they wouldn't let him get out saying that he has autism and NEEDS HELP and that is why.", "I do.

Right now though, a 4000 sqft house down in Texas as well as a Tesla would keep him happy as it would still keep him with his dream.", "It is the exact same thing, but except that benefit is earlier.

Did you ever think at this other school there are more likely to be kids like him and he will fit in better?

Let me spell it out for you if you really can't see the difference:\n\nOption A: You live in a nice, big house with a luxury car, and high tech equipment. You're being bullied severely at school for being in a special ed class, you're not learning anything in school, and you only have a few advanced textbooks to use. You have little to no support in getting into an Ivy League school. Your dreams are basically crushed. You eventually don't go to an Ivy League because a public school (in which you are bullied) with zero accommodations can only go so far. You don't get the job you wanted and could've gotten because you couldn't go to your dream university. People assume you can't get a job because of your autism when you could've. You feel as though you couldn't do anything in your life when you could've. You live with your parents in a big house for the rest of your life feeling like a liability. \n\nOption B: You live in a crappier place with no luxury car, and no high tech equipment. You go to a private school that supports your education and lets you grow into your full potential. You get into your dream school through that support. You get the job you've dreamed of, and get paid generously. You move out of the crappier house into a big, nice house you earned with your blood and sweat.

You're delusional. He wanted to go to that school because not only would it help him get to the university of his dreams, but he has the ability to go if it weren't for your selfish assumptions of what he wants. Yeah, the other cousins are jealous because they never even wanted to go to that school, and probably don't have the capacity to utilize that education system to achieve amazing things. But do you know who can grow exponentially and utilize this education system? YOUR SON. WHO WANTED TO GO THERE, BUT WAS DENIED BY YOU. And you fund your niece and support her to go to that very school? \n\nMan, what a doozy. I hope your son keeps going NC with you because you're a terrible parent. I say this from the bottom of my heart. You're an absolute shitshow of a parent.", "Bullshit. Neurotypicals get jealous all the fucking time.", "If he was NT, he would hate you and dislike the cousin just as much because you intentionally made his school life hell and then gave the cousin the education what he begged you to let him have.\n(on the side note - OK, it's totally a ragebait)", ">She also blames on him for his problems with her.\n\nPlease fix your grammar.
