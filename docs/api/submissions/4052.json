Him and his wife split up and Kevin remarried a year later.

FYI I asked Kevin and he told me he didn\u2019t cheat on his wife. But he did know her and was friends with her beforehand. It was murky at worst imo. \n\nI stopped by my parents house last weekend and all her sisters and a few of their daughters were there. I asked my mom to give my grandma my gift as I won\u2019t be there. My mom asked where I was gonna go and I said hangout at uncle Kevin\u2019s again. This started my aunts attacking me for hanging out with Kevin over being with the family. I said \u201cgiven how y\u2019all have treated Kevin I\u2019m sure me and him are better off\u201d. My aunt said I had no idea what I was talking about. I said \u201cy\u2019all are some hypocrites and you know it. Beth can divorce her husband, break up two marriages and y\u2019all will back that shit up. But where were y\u2019all whenever Kevin got married? I didn\u2019t see any of y\u2019all\u2019s fat asses? Why wasn\u2019t Kevin family because of his mistakes but Beth is? Y\u2019all some fake ass people and sexist. Why didn\u2019t you boycott Beth\u2019s wedding?\u201d Bunch of dumb shit afterwords so I left. \n\nI\u2019ve been told I can only come to Christmas this year if I apologize to everyone. My dad is begging me too. Because he said my mom is miserable with the whole situation. Because my brother is gonna join me at Kevin\u2019s too. I said her lack of ability to stand up for her sons to her own family is why this situation is where it is. Her family is sexist and nobody checks them.

Reddit doesn\u2019t tell us where OP\u2019s from so we don\u2019t know. My point is that OP could\u2019ve gotten his point across without those comments, but he said them, and I bet that\u2019s a significant part of the reason why they want an apology.", "Where I\u2019m from that would be considered insulting, but of course Reddit (thankfully) doesn\u2019t advertise where everyone\u2019s from.

That\u2019s fine. OP\u2019s situation is different because, whether or not it is a figure of speech, he is actively using it in a serious argument with the point of insulting someone. OP\u2019s point was valid, but he could\u2019ve gotten his point across without being petty and adding fuel to the fire.", "Cursing =/= shaming someone's body.

They could be stick thin or obese, you're projecting an image from your head onto reality.\n\n2) like I expressed before, fat ass is not definitely, only aimed at weight. When people I know have been called or even called me a fat ass, it's because I'm being lazy. One example: when I'm closer to the remote and a friend wants it. They ask me for it. I groan. They say \"just do it fat ass.\" \n\nThey say that because I'm being lazy, not because I'm fat. In the story, he's relating the fact he called them fat asses to not going to the wedding, what he sees as a lazy action. \n\nAnd even if you characterize my example as fatphobic, I really don't care because we're talking about private interactions. At any point, these people can remove themselves from the situation if they themselves deem it as fatphobic.\n\n3) finally, we don't know what these people said to begin with that set OP off. They could have called him lazy, and in his lexicon, calling them fat asses is literally the same thing. \n\nIt's just a really weird way to police speech instead of answering the underlying question being asked in the OP: is he the ass for not going and pointing out the hypocrisy of the other family members?", "NTA, you're absolutely right that there's a double standard at play and if anyone was 'worse' it was Beth.", "NTA I\u2019ll honestly say I thought you were being fucked up when reading the beginning because you put so much detail about your cousins situation with her divorce but with your uncles it was kind of like eh it happened, whatever.

It\u2019s unforgivable and I have a saying once a cheater always a cheater.\nMy boyfriends father cheated on his wife now ex wife for 2 and a half years before he divorced her. He was so unhappy in that relationship that he cheated with an already married woman. There is so much wrong in this whole situation that could have been handled differently and prevented but no he CHOSE to cheat because he didn\u2019t want to divorce his wife then but was living in an apartment. \n\nThe fact that you told OP is a hypocrite, that makes you one too", "NTA.
