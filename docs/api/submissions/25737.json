I was confused cause we had 6-7 of that machine and I was the only person using one so it didn't make sense but I told her 10 minutes.\n\nShe had the nerve to ask me if I could move to another machine cause she always used the same one and it was the one I was in but I told her that I was sorry but I was going to finish my workout (also it was during a heatwave & the machine was close to a window so you got fresh air once in a while) and then she could have the machine all to herself but apparently, that wasn't enough and she started talking as to how she had been using this same machine for the last 2 years and no one had never any problem changing machines or finishing their workout early when she asked to which I replied that she could have not used the same machine the last 2 years cause every August when we close for 2 weeks we change every machine & redo the whole gym & even if it was that way, I had worked at that gym for the last 9 years and it would be me that had more right to use it. \n\nThis woman literally started shouting saying how I was being rude and that she would go talk to my boss to fire me for talking to her in that way and not letting the customer be right, but I was not working so I was a customer myself too.\n\nI don't think I did anything wrong but some family members and friends say I could have moved or finished my workout then since it was the last thing on my list so...AITA?", "created_utc": 1693249701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163uxm4/aita_for_telling_a_woman_i_have_more_right_to_the/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But also \"I've been here longer\" is a shitty argument for gym equipment unless you mean that day lol. Lastly, she's already dumb as rocks (we knew that) but you working there doesn't make you an employee if at that time you're using it as a customer. Customer vs customer has the same rights lol. And that \"customer is always right\" bs comes from a longer quote \"the customer is always right in matters of taste and style\" which this is fuckin not. (That's just 1 of like 13 or some shit quotes from a failed businessman that wanted to write a book and now it's the bane of all retail employees)", "NTA\n\nThere were 6 or 7 more of that same machine.  You weren't putting her in any bind.", "Woman sounds entitled AF. NTA", "NTA.  *Plenty* of people watch stuff on their phones when they work out.  I\u2019ve done it myself.  \n\nI imagine what happened was, in the past, people have been nice and did her a favor by letting her use the machine.  She took that for granted, and now assumes she always has rights to it.  \n\nIf there are several other same machines available, she could have used one of those.  Sucks to be her, but you were there first.", "NTA The woman was definitely in the wrong but the fact you worked there made no difference at all since you were not working at that time.", "NTA For whatever reason people get proprietary about the weirdest things. It would never occur to me to ask someone to move because it's my preferred spot.", "NTA.  People seem to be confused that you were in fact working out and there were a ton of other machines open.", "NTA - She tried to pull rank and then realised she was only a rookie.", "Nta because her request was unreasonable", "If there\u2019s 6 of the same machine that are open and 1 that\u2019s in use, you either use one of the open ones or wait your turn. That\u2019s just simple etiquette. I guess there was no harm in her asking, but she\u2019s the one that chose to escalate the situation. She sounds like an entitled brat. You\u2019re NTA at all.", "Nta\nShe's entitled and rude.", "NTA, she's either autistic or extremely entitled.", "We\u2019re you working out or watching videos? If you are just sitting there, got off the machine.", "I don't believe this story that you were calm and chill and she just started screaming. \n\nAlso stop just scrolling on your phone on workout machines and do the workout. \n\nAlso what machine? No gym has 10 of anything besides treadmills but no one does \"sets\" of those. Am I to believe your gym has 10 seated rows 9 were empty and this woman just started yelling at you??", "ESH\n\nWoman is entitled and rude\n\nYou are just sitting there watching a video, so it\u2019s understandable she wanted to use the machine, thinking you were done\n\nYoure sitting there in a heatwave, hogging the machine, camping out on it, *not* working out but instead lounging and watching Youtube and enjoying the fresh air", "ESH. She was obviously rude and the primary AH, but your logic that you were more entitled to the equipment because of your employment history was absurd. I would\u2019ve just stuck to my point that I\u2019d be done in a few minutes, put my headphones on and tuned her out. The woman sucks more, but OP is not exactly a beacon of maturity here.", "ESH \nShe could\u2019ve used a different machine. You\u2019re in your right to use the machine until you finish. Both of you are childish for throwing out how long you\u2019ve been using the machine/working there.", "ESH. She should have used another machine. But you don\u2019t get to be any more entitled than she does. Also, watching videos while hogging a machine is so Chad.", "INFO: you said you were watching a video.  What type?  Was it to review a weight lifting technique or entertainment?", ">watching some videos on my phone.\n\nYTA.  That's not what gym machines are for.  Go to the break room.", "ESH.  Trying to claim a specific machine when there are 6 other identical ones is weird.  You, on the other hand, aren't working out if you're watching videos on your phone (unless it's a treadmill).  They're not lounge chairs, they're workout equipment.  Either use it or get off.", "NTA \n\nNothing is more annoying than someone watching their phone on a machine.  Ten more mins?  What type of machine was it that you need ten more mins?  Unless you're on a cardio machine, everything you're doing here is messed up.  If it's a treadmill or something, I'll change my vote.\n\nEdit to change vote, cardio is totally different from weights, never ask someone to stop cardio", "YTA...who cares how long you've been at the gym...she pays the same membership fee and is entitled to the exact same access you are...", "I know there were six other machines free, but if you weren't using the machine, you should get up for anyone who asks. If you were using it, that would be one thing, but if you are just hanging out, get up.", "WTF??? There is no room for that reason!", "WHY??? **WHY** do your family and friends feel you should have stopped and moved? When did it become standard normal to just always defer to bad behavior? There are 7 other machines you can use and you're interrupting me? Why was she comfortable doing it? Because she does it all the time and folks always let her. \n\n\"Maam, please don't touch me again unless I'm on fire and you need yo make me aware of it.\" Then put your headphones back in and ignore the cataclysmic meltdown going on next to you. You don't need to tell her the gym procedure, where you work or how long you've worked there, or that it was your grandma's dearest wish that you always use that machine. \"Can I have this machine?\" \"No\" Done.\n\nI could understand if you were just lounging on the machine watching videos and the gym was full, etc. But that's not the case.\n\nNTA", "You could have said, 'This machine and I had a commitment ceremony and even though it is not monogamous I am its primary and therefore we are going to finish my set' and been somewhat the asshole.  As it is you are NTA.", "NTA. Maybe she has some anxiety or obsession that means she only feels comfortable with the one machine in that exact location, but even so, she could\u2019ve just done another exercise whilst she waited for you to finish. The fact she said no one else has ever had a problem changing machines with her when she asked, means she is obviously used to getting her own way and if it\u2019s true and you\u2019re the first person to stand up to her, she was probably shocked and a little entitled.", "Definitely NTA. This women is harassing people every time she goes to the gym making them change machine in the middle of their workout. Most people give in because they don't want drama, but this has just caused the woman to become more entitled. Hopefully now you've stood up to her she might just take a free machine without bothering anyone next time. Or she should get a home gym is she is that fussy.", "Of course \"I've been here longer\" is a stupid argument, but it was the other woman who tried to use it and it's a good rebuttal to a stupid argument.", "This is the right answer.  Op is nta for not moving but his logic for not moving is deeply flawed.", "at my job, which is where i go to the gym, there's comments like those all the time. theres 3 toilets but 1 is closed for cleaning? i want the closed one cause i always go there. the changing rooms? 2 for each sex and the one you close is always the one they want so ive heard it a million times", "I was still working out but i tend to have videos on my phone so the workout passes faster", "it was a bike and as i said there were 6-7 more empty of the same exact one i as using and i have worked there for 9 years and had to deal with lots of people screaming at me for not letting them go inside the changing room ( there was a second one free) cause it was about to be cleaned and needs to be empty and they prefered that one and considering i was at my place of work i tend to try stay as calm as i can cause i dont want to possibly get in trouble. did i raise my voice or yell? nah but i wasnt talking to the woman in my nicest voice", "She said she was working out and watching a video, it's literally in the first sentence.", "Watching videos while actively using a machine - I presume cardio?- is perfectly legitimate. I was just doing that myself- it's how I keep myself occupied and distracted while I do cardio, especially on the bikes. Lots of people do that, or listen to audiobooks, or music, or whatever.", "I was doing cardio and i watch videos so its not as boring and have something to pass time faster. and i know saying how long i had been working there wasnt the best but if she didnt understand the no and went for the 2 year thing, thats why i said what i said. i dont tend to asnwer that way ever at the gym cause people normaly either wait or choose another machine", "I was on a cardio machine so i tend to like to put race cars videos on youtube while working out so time goes by fast", "This is nonsense. You can watch videos and work out on some machines.", "They're off clock why would they possibly not be allowed to have a video on while working out? Use your brain next time please.", "i was on a bike so i wasnt simply refusing to move cause i didnt want her to use it but i was actively using it and i use my phone to watch stuff so its not as boring and time passes way faster that way", "Multiple sets with rests.\n\n10 mins is reasonable. If it was a crowded place then the polite thing is to share the machine between sets. If there is 6 other machines my ass can be kissed.", "OP has stated in several comments it was a stationary bicycle, so yes it's a cardio machine and it is easy to use while watching phone videos.", "Yes, they have equal rights to the machine. So why should OP have to change the machine they are already using to accommodate her?", "If i wasnt actively using it and it was the only machine i would have hopped out of it but i was using it and she had 6 more machines that were the same free but wanted exactly mine for whatever reason", "I was actually using it and she saw it. i wouldn't had a problem if i wasnt using it and was just chilling there to let her use it", "they think since i work there i had to be nice about it even when i wasnt actually working but was a customer aswell. i was also actively using the machine so i wasnt simply there for fun", "They'd also complain if the toilets and changing rooms were not clean, so, sometimes you just can't win!", "ok, so the woman went up to her and asked her to move machines while she was actively working out???? no, that doesn\u2019t make sense. I think you misunderstood what you read.", "No, that appears to be what happened- the woman wanted to boot her off early so SHE could have the one machine of the six or seven identical ones that SHE liked best. Ridiculously entitled but not unbelievable.", "I mean that's literally exactly what is described by OP, yes", "if OP is actively working out then it changes the judgment to NTA, but they really make it seem like they\u2019re just sitting there watching a video - in between sets, or just catching a breather and getting some fresh air after finishing. \n\nOtherwise, why would they mention they were watching a video? thats completely pointless to the story and only serves to confuse people. \n\nasking someone to move machines, or even asking them when they will be done, is incredibly rude and uncalled for when that person is actively working out", "Nta, but I think gym-time seniority is completely irrelevant.", "I feel like we had pretty much this exact AITA about 3 months ago? I dunno why so many entitled people at gyms, but NTA in the grand scheme of it. Not worth arguing with her over, you can just say no next time and leave it at that.", "NTA. Her expectations were unreasonable and outside of social norms for gyms. As a side note - do not disclose to someone you are arguing with that you work there. The weirdo may start lying about the interaction to your boss, making your life harder for no reason. They have already shown themselves to be unreasonable in their initial approach, why do you think they would be reasonable in escalating the argument?", "As a regular gym goer I often use the same machines because of a view out of a window or the other machines make noises or something. I get that the person wants a particular machine... But!\n\nIf those machines are busy... I use a different one! Simple. \n\nIf all the machines are busy? I wait and use whatever one is free first!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut a simple NO would have been sufficient and reasonable.", "People are way too entitled. I'd have told her to kick rocks and put my music back on and ignored anything else she had to yap about", "NTA - sometime entitled people get butt hurt when someone does not immediately fall over themselves to do exactly what they want, when they want it. So what - she\u2019ll get over It.", "NTA for not moving,  but no, you don't have more rights because you've worked there.", "ESH   You should not argue with silly people. Ignore them.", "You're NTA. Both of you were kind of childish with the *I've been here longer* argument, but the fact is you were already using the machine and it's rude as heck to interrupt someone else's workout and demand they move to a different machine.", "NTA . . . because she's much worse. Reasoning that you should use a particular machine because you've worked there 9 years?  Not stellar, but I'd go off on her for her extremely rude and entitled behavior.\nNTA minus the 9 years thing.", "Your explanation impressed me as it included the realization that you could have handled it better\n\nI revise my qualified NTA to an enthusiastic NTA because you'll handle AHs better in the future.", "Aerobics classes are crazy like this.  People will go 15 minutes early to claim THEIR SPOT in the classroom and then just hang out until class starts. \n\nHeaven forfend someone get there before them.  IT'S MY SPOT!!!!", "Stupid demands require equally stupid rebuttals, you need to fight 'em on their level.", "Watching videos while OP uses a cycling machine makes her ... a Chad? Lol wut? NTA OP some of these folks don't seem to have very good reading comprehension.", "Or maybe the person bugging OP can go to the other machines that are available to use. NTA", "LOL On Saturday's I go pick up a church bulletin for my aunt and uncle. We live in the same town and they have mobility issues so can't go to church anymore. They watch the on-line service. People start showing up at 3 pm for a 4 pm service to get a parking space, it's hilarious. The church has plenty of parking. The dirty looks I get it I park in someone else's \"space\" if I am running late when I grab it... absolute death stares.", "As a former group fitness instructor I totally agree with this. \n\nThey would stand at the door and the moment a class ended they were shoving their way in a soon as they could! \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd I was on a platform!!!", "\u201cDeeply flawed\u201d\n\n The situation is not that serious. \nAnd as OP only brought up the longevity of his employment after the hateful heifer said she was entitled to use of the machine on demand because she\u2019d been using it for the last two years, OP was obvious using her own flawed logic against her. \nIt\u2019s actually a brilliant move that I\u2019m sure went right over the entitled hussy\u2019s head.", "He who? OP said they're female", "No, because if you wrestle with a pig, you both end up covered in shit and the pig likes it.", "Ahh.  Got it.  I was thinking weight machine so this makes a lot more sense.  Definitely NTA, although with that post title\u2026.", "Then I\u2019ll change my vote, cardio can be hours", "Who says i dont? :p"]}
