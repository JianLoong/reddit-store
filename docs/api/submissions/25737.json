And that \"customer is always right\" bs comes from a longer quote \"the customer is always right in matters of taste and style\" which this is fuckin not.

She was obviously rude and the primary AH, but your logic that you were more entitled to the equipment because of your employment history was absurd.

The fact she said no one else has ever had a problem changing machines with her when she asked, means she is obviously used to getting her own way and if it\u2019s true and you\u2019re the first person to stand up to her, she was probably shocked and a little entitled.", "Definitely NTA. This women is harassing people every time she goes to the gym making them change machine in the middle of their workout. Most people give in because they don't want drama, but this has just caused the woman to become more entitled. Hopefully now you've stood up to her she might just take a free machine without bothering anyone next time.

I think you misunderstood what you read.", "No, that appears to be what happened- the woman wanted to boot her off early so SHE could have the one machine of the six or seven identical ones that SHE liked best. Ridiculously entitled but not unbelievable.", "I mean that's literally exactly what is described by OP, yes", "if OP is actively working out then it changes the judgment to NTA, but they really make it seem like they\u2019re just sitting there watching a video - in between sets, or just catching a breather and getting some fresh air after finishing. \n\nOtherwise, why would they mention they were watching a video? thats completely pointless to the story and only serves to confuse people. \n\nasking someone to move machines, or even asking them when they will be done, is incredibly rude and uncalled for when that person is actively working out", "Nta, but I think gym-time seniority is completely irrelevant.", "I feel like we had pretty much this exact AITA about 3 months ago? I dunno why so many entitled people at gyms, but NTA in the grand scheme of it. Not worth arguing with her over, you can just say no next time and leave it at that.", "NTA. Her expectations were unreasonable and outside of social norms for gyms. As a side note - do not disclose to someone you are arguing with that you work there. The weirdo may start lying about the interaction to your boss, making your life harder for no reason.

I wait and use whatever one is free first!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut a simple NO would have been sufficient and reasonable.", "People are way too entitled.

Reasoning that you should use a particular machine because you've worked there 9 years?  Not stellar, but I'd go off on her for her extremely rude and entitled behavior.\nNTA minus the 9 years thing.", "Your explanation impressed me as it included the realization that you could have handled it better\n\nI revise my qualified NTA to an enthusiastic NTA because you'll handle AHs better in the future.", "Aerobics classes are crazy like this.

OP\u2019s sentence clearly states she was working out.", "He also said he was \u201cwatching some videos on my phone.\u201d To be fair, if it\u2019s a treadmill or similar, he could do that while also working out. If that\u2019s the case, I retract my comment.", ">it was a bike and as i said there were 6-7 more empty of the same exact one i as using\n\nif there were so many available bikes, why couldn't you use a different one?, why you had to start a scene over it?", "Lawd, if you sit in somebody's pew inside the service, the STINK EYE these old biddies give! Some have no filter and just straight up tell visitors to move out of *their* seat.\n\nSource: I am a pastor who then has to chase down the visitor after church ends and profusely apologize. [Yet 'they're a friendly, welcoming church' that just doesn't understand why they're not growing \ud83e\udd26]", "\u201cNo one else has a problem with it!\u201d \n\n\u201cGood for them\u201d put headphones in.", "I hate it when people are watching videos on the weight machines. \nIf it's a reasonable interval maybe, but usually they take so long. \nAlways feel like I should say something, but usually as long as it is, it's not as long that it's worth a conflict.\nMildly infuriating.", "OP is a woman (28f). I also don\u2019t know many gyms that have 6-7 of the same machine unless it\u2019s cardio equipment, so I\u2019m personally assuming that it was a treadmill/Crosstrainer.", "Why would she stop her workout that\u2019s already being tracked on the current bike she\u2019s using just because some woman can\u2019t use the other 6-7? Sounds ridiculous, also she wasn\u2019t the one to make a scene.", "When there are 8 other machines to use? That infuriates you mildly?", "I'm talking about weight machines where usually there aren't 8 other machines obviously.", "ESH", "ESH\n\nNobody has more right to a machine than anyone else. At that moment you had the right to finish your workout, but you working there has no bearing on your \u201cright\u201d to use a particular machine.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sick of entitled ppl. They want what you have. When told No the tantrum throwing starts.", "NTA. Some women are just too coddled by our society that they feel entitled to get everything they want.", "NTA. Next time after you say \"I'll be done in 10 minutes\" put your headphones back in and refuse to take them out. No further communication is needed than \"I will be done in x minutes\"\n\nIf she taps you on the shoulder again say \"I do not consent to you touching my body\" loud enough that others hear it. That usually makes them scurry away.", "Watching videos on your phone, at the gym. YTA.", "NTA!!", "Next time just say no. By all means let whoever know how long you will be. Beyond that you owe no explanation to anyone for anything. \n\nStop compromising yourself for others", "You're NTA.\n\nHowever, if you'll take some advice - don't argue with people like this. It's just a waste of breath. Instead, put your headphones back on and turn the volume up.", "I feel like in situations like these it is so easy to appease everyone and just move machines. If there\u2019s 6 or 7 of the same machine is it really a big deal if you move one or two down so this person can be in their preferred spot? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for saying \u201cno\u201d because you were clearly already there and told her you\u2019d only need ten more minutes, pretty normal and accurate communication, but if I personally am in this situation i\u2019ll probably just say \u201csure\u201d and move over because to me, it\u2019s not an inconvenience and everyone\u2019s happy.", "Nta. Would I have handled it differently? Yes. \n\nFood for thought. This kind of response to a almost OCD kind of behaviour would have just had me move. This is not a normal reaction from a rational person and it's simply not worth it being right. I am saying that out of the perspective of a mother of a autistic child. The response is just a very stressed and emotional one and you can't access reason with someone while they are in a state that resembles fight, flight, freeze. Pushing hard against that and causing the response to be worse is just unnecessary.\n\nI do find you have no right to a machine because you work there. You had the right because you were using it first. It makes you sound a bit spoilt to think of yourself as more entitled because of working there. I don't quite understand that reasoning. In my mind my manager would expect me to act overly polite and less entitled towards people who are customers because I work there even when being off.", "I agree with this, also I would add that in a scenario like this it's generally not a good idea to tell the person you work there if you're already off the clock, you're just giving them ammunition against you because now they know they can complain to your boss. Probably won't amount to anything, but it's best to just not open up that door if you don't have to.", "You\u2019re mistaken about it being a longer quote. The phrase \u201cDe gustibus non est disputandum\u201d is a Latin maxim which translates to \u201cIn matters of taste, there can be no disputes\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s no accounting for taste.\u201d \u201cThe customer is always right\u201d comes from a quote from C\u00e9sar Ritz, a famous hotelier. The original is \u201cLe client n\u2019a jamais tort,\u201d which translates to \u201cThe customer is never wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe customer is always right\u201d and \u201cIn matters of taste, there can be no disputes\u201d are two separate sayings, each with its own origin and context. It\u2019s possible that over time and with various interpretations and reiterations, these phrases have been merged or misquoted. But traditionally, they stand alone with their distinct meanings and origins.\n\nRegardless, the OP is NTA.", "That sounds more like OCD, being unable to fit any change into the workout.", "On. Headphones go on, earbuds go in.", "Some people just need to read before commenting."]}
