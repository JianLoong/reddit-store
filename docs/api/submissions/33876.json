I really want to thank all of you for your perspectives and advice. Just wanted to give an update\n\nRegarding Thanksgiving dinner, when my dad and Nicole arrived, I asked if I could speak with them both. My dad said he didn\u2019t want to talk and went into the living room. Nicole still remained by the front door, so I apologized for insulting her. She replied that she needed to leave and went to the living room. Overall, she still seemed rightfully angry with me. Dinner was awkward because my grandma would try to get my dad and I to talk, but he wouldn\u2019t really bother. After dinner, I pulled him aside and apologized again. He ignored me and went straight to Nicole. I still wasn\u2019t sure if I was heading back with him or not, so I packed everything just in case. When he was getting ready to leave, I asked him if I could come back home. He said Nicole wasn\u2019t comfortable having me home even though it had been a few days since the incident. I spent the entire night crying on the phone with my sister.\n\n  \nTherapy and Living Situation: After having my call with my maternal grandpa, he called my paternal grandparents a couple days later to discuss my situation. I overheard the call between them. My maternal grandpa expressed he was concerned about me, especially my mental state and asked my paternal grandparents if they were willing to talk to my dad about putting me in therapy. My grandparents said they\u2019d be willing to take me to their church\u2019s mental support group or talk with their faith leader who specializes in grief counseling. My grandpa pushed back on the idea and mentioned a need for more professional help, but they were not receptive to the idea. All three of them also had a heated conversation about my living arrangement. My grandpa said it was ridiculous for a grown man to throw out their daughter, and it was shameful that my paternal grandparents are not hard-pressed in helping me get back home. That\u2019s all I heard regarding the conversation.\n\n  \nNow, my grandma started taking me to weekly private sessions with the faith leader. I\u2019m not entirely happy with the arrangement, but it has helped me start to process my grief in a healthier way. Also, I am still living with my grandparents. I apologized over and over through text to my dad and through my grandparents, but he has not responded. My maternal grandpa has called my dad many times, but my dad blocked him. I am contemplating telling my school counselor next semester all the details regarding my dad and not omitting anything to protect him. I also wasn\u2019t invited to my dad and Nicole\u2019s Christmas dinner which hurt, but I\u2019m starting to not care to have a relationship with my dad. I don\u2019t know if my feelings will change. In a twisted way, it was good he didn\u2019t let me go back home with him. The space has helped me focus on myself.", "created_utc": 1703710947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sb48q/update_aita_for_insulting_my_fathers_girlfriend/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Just caught up on the original post; NTA.  You have nothing to apologize for, after what they did to your sister.  That was serious neglect.  I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but you and your sister would probably be better off with your grandparents, for your own mental health.  Your father is an irresponsible child, and it\u2019s only going to get worse with the new baby.", "I\u2019m so sorry that you have deal with this I\u2019m in tears whilst typing this. \n\nYou need to expose him completely he is able to get away with everything because people still believe he is a good father when he is a terrible one. \n\nAlso I would send him one final text message and tell him that he should disregard all previous apologies as you didn\u2019t mean them and you are happy for him to sign away his rights to your grandpa. \n\nThen go full scorched earth and destroy him, he should be ashamed of himself", "I'm so sorry your dad is such a weak person and that your grandparents are enabling him and refusing you the help that you deserve. You'll soon be 18, then you can move in with your maternal grandfather and get some real therapy to help you unpack the abandonment and abuse you've suffered. Get yourself stable and get an education so you can be there for your sister when she needs rescuing. I have a feeling that she will be used as a constant babysitter. \n\nI thy you should tell the school counselor *everything*, but if you can wait for your 18th birthday to do that, you should. Don't tell your grandparents or the faith leader that you're planning to report him or that you are planning to leave.\n\n\nBest of luck, OP. I hope things get better for you soon.", "You\u2019ve done the right thing to apologize for something you said while you were feeling big feelings. Whether you meant it or not is irrelevant, but as a child, you\u2019re not always going to have the restraint to not say things in times of overwhelming feelings. The ball is in your dad\u2019s court. As the adult who is supposed to be caring for you, it is his responsibility to bounce back from that experience and figure out how to make this new situation work for everyone involved. I\u2019m sorry that you seem to be left out of the equation at this point. Every child deserves better than that, no matter what you said. As a child who lost your mother at a young age, experiencing a new woman who seems to be trying to replace your mother is a hard thing to deal with, and your father should be helping you through that. Your dad should have been more receptive to your feelings and talking with and listening to you to help you feel less distressed about the changing family situation. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m just baffled by the thing you wrote about how you called your dad for urgent help after your sister was injured, and dad\u2019s GF just hung up on you. Any parent worth their salt would have been LIVID with a person who prevented their child from communicating a need for help like that. \n\nOverall, I really hope for the best for you for the future. You don\u2019t have control over your dad\u2019s actions and reactions, so all you can do is just the best you can to get used to the new circumstances. If you\u2019re staying with your grandparents for the foreseeable future, that may actually be best for you. Focus on doing your best at school so you can move forward as an adult, hopefully with healthier relationships. \u2764\ufe0f", "#[Please Find Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1809jnm/aita_for_insulting_my_fathers_girlfriend_and/)", "You're 17 if my maths is correct and still a minor.  Even if you've just turned 18, you are still a young kid.\n\nCan you live with your maternal grandparents as it sounds like you are currently living with your paternal grandparents?\n\nWhat your grandmother is doing now with the faith therapist will probably do more damage.  Would your maternal grandparents be able to perhaps pay for a real therapist but do it via telehealth unless you can drive yourself?\n\nIf your maternal grandparents can take you but they live too far for you to continue at your current school then it may be a matter of just getting through this last school year and you will be done by April/May.  It will fell like forever but if you focus on your schooling then it may distract you enough from your living situation to get you through.\n\nYou may also need some meds to help calm your brain so that the talk therapy can work.\n\nI have no respect for your father.  He was not there for you after your mother died... and it's possible that he wasn't there for you before that and your mother was doing it all.\n\nNicole is a nasty woman who just wants your father.  She probably didn't like the baggage (you and your sister) that came with him so has done her best to alienate you from him.\n\nHow much younger is Nicole?  Your dad may have another child to her... he also might not.. but he may find himself very lonely if he needs more support as he ages because you and your sister won't be there.\n\nBut after you finish high school you probably need to get out of where you are.  Either get a job and move out.  Or move out to college.  Focus on your future and where you are headed as your dad and Nicole aren't worth it and you are better than them. Don't let them drag you down.  You have your whole life ahead of you.\n\nThe school may have counselling services you can access too.  Speak to someone there about it.", "How old is your sister?

The father you knew died the moment he started dating Nicole. Mourn your father in the grief counseling. When you're allowed to get a legitimate counselor, process everything. Tell the school counselor everything, expose both of them. We're all supporting you.", "She definitely is. My dad has only gone on one major trip between Thanksgiving and now, and during that time, she stayed over. She also stays over on weekends too. I just hope he's better with the baby than he was with us. Ty for your support:)", "It's tragic he doesn't even realize he lost 2 of his children. Make arrangements with your sister to collect everything belonging to your mom and get them to your maternal grandfather before your dad and his gf decides to throw everything away. Try to be discrete. Since he's always gone, it might be easier to do so. Especially her jewelry, wedding dress, pictures, wedding rings, everything."]}
