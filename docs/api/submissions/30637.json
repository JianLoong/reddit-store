She mostly just wanted to celebrate with family on her birthday, my sister\u2019s family lives nearby and Mona is really close to her cousins. \n\nMy wife often has to travel for work, and she had an important conference the day after Mona\u2019s birthday, so she couldn\u2019t be home on the day. My wife felt bad about this, especially because Mona was really sad when she told her. So my wife promised that she had a wonderful surprise planned for the weekend after Mona\u2019s birthday, when she was home from the conference. I didn\u2019t know about this so I asked her later what she had planned. \n\nShe said she hadn\u2019t planned anything yet but she thought we could stay the weekend at a campground a few hours away, and bring Mona\u2019s cousins. That sounded like a great idea so I asked if I should arrange it, because my wife was already super stressed about the conference coming up. But she said it was fine, and that she would do a better job of planning it. \n\nMy wife brought up the \u201csurprise\u201d at least 3 or 4 times the week before Mona\u2019s birthday, and she was super excited. My wife left the night before her birthday and on her birthday itself, I just hung out with Mona and did normal things like getting her a piece of cake and pizza. \n\nMy wife came home Friday evening and I asked her if she\u2019d booked the campsite for the weekend. She was horrified and said that she\u2019d completely forgotten. I was pretty angry with her but I didn\u2019t say anything, I just said that Mona would be disappointed and that I would book for the next weekend. My wife said she was really sorry, and I said it\u2019s ok but you\u2019re the one telling her, because she\u2019s been excited all week. My wife was really tired so she went to sleep straightaway after hugging Mona. \n\nThen Mona was jumping up and down telling me how happy she was that mommy was back and she could finally know what the surprise was. I told her I\u2019m so sorry baby but mom forgot to plan the surprise, because she\u2019s been really busy with work. I promise it\u2019ll still happen though, probably next weekend. \n\nShe was really upset and angry with her mom. The next morning she asked my wife why she lied about the surprise. My wife said she didn\u2019t lie, of course not, it just had to be postponed. Mona said that her daddy said she forgot, and daddy doesn\u2019t lie. Now my wife is furious that I made her look bad in front of Mona and hurt Mona too.", "created_utc": 1699532950, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rbuty/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_her_mom_forgot/", "score": 3675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP was a massive YTA when he told the daughter she had nothing planned, he knew it would upset his daughter, and his wife, and did it anyway", "I just don't understand how she insists on planning and even talks about the surprise often but still forgets.", "ESH\n\n> My wife said she didn\u2019t lie\n\n#SHE \\*DID\\* LIE!!\n\n> So my wife **promised that she had a wonderful surprise _planned_** for the weekend after Mona\u2019s birthday\n\n> She said she **hadn\u2019t _planned_ anything** yet\n\nShe had **not** planned it.", "The daughter *should* feel that way, since she quite clearly *does* matter less to the wife. She's old enough to know the truth, and by the sounds of it, was already starting to figure it out on her own.", "You are morally bankrupt!", ">If your wife was a regularly neglectful parent\n\n\"Mona said that her daddy said she forgot, and daddy doesn\u2019t lie.\"\n\nIt sounds like mom has fudged the truth before.", "Mom deserves the wake up call. She basically forgot her kids birthday. She had multiple opportunities to sort it. Maybe she will readjust her priorities or ask for help in the future.", "In what way does it sound like she isn't? She said \"I have a surprise\" to her daughter *before she had any idea what her surprise was*. Then, she doesn't even plan anything and refuses to let her husband, the daughter's father, do any planning, and then she drops the ball.\n\nAlso it's unlikely \"Your mom forgot\" was the first thing he said. The 9 year old probably bombarded him with questions about why she couldn't know more about the surprise.\n\nAlso, what if the campground was fully booked for the next month and there was nowhere they could go, or the cousins were busy and couldn't come along? What does the mom have planned then?", "Where are you getting the idea that the wife isn't a regularly neglectful parent. All we know about her from the post is that she missed her kids birthday because of a work commitment and then made a promise she forgot about.\n\nThen in the comments we find out that this is a recurring theme \n\nStraight up sounds like a classic case of work over children to me", "More like NTA close to e s h", "This is not the first or the last time the wife promises crap and delivers shit though. I don't think the kid is really questioning who did the disappointing here.", "That is pedantic bullshit. It is clear from the OP that the daughter believed it was the weekend immediately after their birthday. Being a pedantic asshole to your child would still be disappointing to them.", "Nothing like completely neglecting to hold up a promise made directly to your childs face and pretending like everything is ok!", "Really? Mom hyping up the daughter 3-4x in a week before birthday only to forget and \"Dad doesn't lie\", not to mention rejected op's offer because she can do better are not enough to push mom into asshole category? Wow. People.", "Also she's 9 not 5, I know at 9 I could detect when someone was bullshitting me THAT much. Telling her that her surprise was that her surprise was actually next week or whatever he would have made up on the spot, would not have been believable and only make \"daddy a liar\"", "They are acting like kids are stupid, come on, they can perceive things, they live with the parents, they can learn to read them and their behaviors. Wife failed multiple times when given the chance to fix the problem and somehow she gets a green pass? Sometimes I don't understand reddit.", "100%. I\u2019m a big believer in owning your mistakes with your kids and saying sorry when you make them. It lets them know it\u2019s okay to make mistakes but to apologise for them when you do.", "Hell, every family film in the 90s had this as the plot device.  The mom here is basically Robin Williams in Hook.  The moral of the story was never \"help working dad lie better, it's not his fault!\"", "I think people are being a bit dramatic. Theyre making it sound like the girl just found out her mom tried to drown her in the bathtub. Finding out your mom forgot to do what she told you she would isn't exactly a life altering experience. She has a right to be angry, but that is part of life.", "Is it always the wife? Or just always the woman? I don't spend much time on this sub myself.\n\nThere are a lot of double standards for things which women can do and be defended for but men would never be allowed to or get called out for it. The wife part wouldnt seem to make a big difference to that.\n\nOf course there is some of the same that women cant do whilst men can but I feel like thats far less common.", "One might say the surprise was that Mom is a douchenozzle. /s", "I have dozens of reminders that go off every day to the point that most of them are just noise. \n\nIf you have a reminder for everything then nothing is important/stands out. \n\nIt is impossible to keep up with everything. Personally I spend the day putting out whichever direction is burning the biggest and deal with the order of priority from there. Many things don\u2019t end up getting addressed until they themselves are now fires. Not enough hours in the day.  Perhaps mom had to prioritize not losing her job and paying the bills before a birthday party.", "Because he could\u2019ve protected his child from being hurt. Instead, he let her get hurt because he was (rightfully) mad at his wife. I get why he\u2019s pissed, and I get the impulse to rat her out to their kid, but the end result, no matter whose fault it is, is that this 9-year-old child was hurt, and he could\u2019ve spared her that pain but didn\u2019t.", "Are we supposed to think the 9 year old is better off being told that her mom is neglectful?", "It\u2019s very obvious. As the mom, wife, and person who has a travel-heavy job, I\u2019m shaking my head at how absolutely zero room is given to the wife by some of these folks.  \n\nTravel is so taxing on the body. OP should\u2019ve known this and given grace to his own damn wife. IDK what she would\u2019ve said to the kid\u2014a lot of assumptions are being made that she\u2019d lie but we don\u2019t know because OP didn\u2019t let her like they agreed. \n\nOP was definitely YTA for not being a partner to his wife in this moment.  It\u2019s very telling that Mona thinks \u201cdaddy doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d Seems like as much as people think the wife wanted the \u201cglory\u201d of an epic surprise, OP wants the glory of being a saint-who-does-no-wrong.", "Agreed. It\u2019s always better to know one of your parents won\u2019t lie to you. Even for your own \u2018good\u2019. And mum was not made to look bad. I bet mum is always really busy for everything. \n\nOP was saving his daughter from the real surprise of learning who her mother really is.\n\nBecause honestly. The way OP writes and constantly mentions how busy his wife is\u2026 he\u2019s reaching in his own mind to justify this because it happens often.

They're treating her like she did all this work and put all this thought into it, when all she did was make a promise even before coming up with an idea, then eventually came up with the idea and literally stopped there, even when her husband asked if he should set it up for her.\n\nIsn't the idea of a relationship where the husband promises to take care of housework but leaves it alone for so long that the wife has to take care of it commonly considered a red flag? Because promising you're going to do something, and failing to bother at all within a reasonable time frame, or even an unreasonable one, is pretty thoughtless behavior?", "I find it weird that this didn\u2019t come up the entire week she was gone. He couldn\u2019t say, \u201cHey did you book the campsite?\u201d via phone or text over the course of the week? My husband and I do that for each other when we know the other one is bogged down in work and other concerns. I would *never* throw him under the bus like this to my daughter. My mom did that when my dad was too busy with work and I hated it. You have to be a team, and sometimes that means taking up the slack when life is making it more difficult and your spouse can\u2019t juggle as much as they thought they could.

She kept bragging about how cool her surprise was so clearly she didn't just forget did she?\n\nI can't see this sub telling a wife to follow up on her working husband to see if he has organised something for the kids.", "Well I wasn't expecting that. Teenage girls makes sense though", "I responded to your suggestion that the person above keep their sentiment when a birthday or anniversary is forgotten.

She could have just as easily said \"There will be a big surprise when I get back.\", in which case, it's not a lie.

You can use \"plan\" to mean \"the big idea\" or you can use \"plan\" to mean \"the blue print of how to get things done\".    When mom said she didn't have a plan then I think she was meaning that she hadn't nailed down all the details rather than she had no idea what they were going to do.   There is quite a lot of planning to do when going camping with other people's kids rather than go to the movies as a family", "Oh yes, the only two options were to build up false anticipation through a lie or to completely give up and not even bother. No chance she could have just said that she hasn't figured it out just yet, or asked the kid what she would want to do. And it's definitely a good idea to lie about it, and then keep it on the back burner for so long she forgot to actually address it, because I'm sure there wasn't a better option there either."]}
