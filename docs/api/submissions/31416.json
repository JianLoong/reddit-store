We both make around 100K per year.\n\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nI am a 40 yo female with a 40 yo boyfriend and this will be our 3rd year as a couple. I do make more money than he does, but we are both doing ok financially. Every year my birthday is about a month before my boyfriend\u2019s.  For his birthday, I plan a nice dinner out (get reservations and babysitter) and then get him a nice gift. He enjoys sports and concerts, so it\u2019s always tickets to a game or a concert in a nearby city, bought months beforehand. I will line up and pay for dinner and hotel with the concert/sports game as well, so it\u2019s kinda like two birthday celebrations.\n\nHowever on my birthday, Im assuming he forgets in the morning because he says nothing, but then comes home and ask me where I want to eat. So obviously it has to be a place that doesn\u2019t take reservations and does take kids. Then he gives me a small gift (flowers and a necklace from Amazon year one, a fuzzy robe and blanket year two) and calls it good.\n\nSo after my birthday this year when we ate out last minute and I received a similar gift, I decided to sell the concert tickets and just do a similar birthday for him. I asked him where he wanted to eat the night of his birthday, took him out to eat there (no kids), and gave him a small gift (new wallet and tie). He looked confused when opening his gift and now he says he\u2019s really disappointed we are not taking a fun little trip together for his birthday like we normally do. I said I\u2019m tired of putting more time, effort, and significantly more money into his birthday when he barely seems to remember mine.

In past relationships I have noticed that pattern in myself. I fed them and put more effort into feeding them, did elaborate birthdays, very thoughtful and meaningful Christmas gifts, did acts of service when they were busy (e.g. cleaned their house) but got about 20% of the effort/consideration/time etc back.\n\nTL;DR, I cared about them more than they cared about me\n\nI'm a broke student with some disabling congenital health issues. I do not have the time and energy, nor do I have the money to spend on someone who cannot care to show they give a shit about me. When a partner does the things I do for them (suprise me with take out after a long night of work, or offer to help with xyz that has been weighing on me) it shows they appreciate what I do for them, and that maybe they think about me when I'm not there (when they're not horny).\n\nTo compensate, I would subconsciously give more and more to try to \"win\" the affection and care I wanted, but this is not how it works with these people.  Do you know how I learned that? When I'd exhuast myself bending over backwards for them. My current partner who does give a shit about me has confirmed it. I can comfortably take care of him  the way I take care of my friends and family, and he gives me emotional support, does  dishes at my house without asking, and feeds me when I'm exhausted and would rather go to bed hungry.\n\n\nTry not to give people more than they will give to you: the others in your life who take better care of you deserve more of your money, time and energy than the ones who don't.", "Nope!!! U did right. Coz if he didn\u2019t mind the gifting part he wouldn\u2019t be offended by ur not so expensive gift.

My dh was like this with Christmas gifts. One year my big gift was new windshield wipers for my car. Another year was a drill. Another year he didn't buy me anything - although he did help the kids buy me new dishtowels. I cried that year, so he offered to take me shopping. I told him to forget it. He also knew that Christmas was very traumatic for me growing up so I already hated the holiday. \n\nSo one year I put as little thought into his gifts as he did mine. He got a flashlight and some car trinkets. He was so confused. \n\nBut ever since he's asked me ahead of time what I wanted, and he's done pretty good to get me what I asked for.  I think doing it back to him showed him just how much disrespect he was showing me and made him really think about it.", "NTA. You cannot nag or force your bf to care and to put thought into his actions. You teach people how to treat you and so far you've taught him that he can be lazy with your birthday but you'll still go all-out for his. \n\nThis won't be a popular thing to say on Reddit but there are a LOT of men just like your bf. Often they were raised in homes where good behavior was not modeled. They never had to put thought or effort into other people's birthdays or Christmas but they still were given great gifts and made a big deal over and they got used to that being the norm.\n\nSince you want the relationship to work you need to figure out if this is a dealbreaker. If not, lower your expectations! Let your bf do what he normally does and you do equally only don't do it in anger or revenge, let it go.", "What goes around comes around I guess.

We know how you think a relationship runs - with affection, thought, input and care as to the others feelings  \n\n\nHe made absolutely  minimal effort  - and now we know what he thinks is appropriate in a relationship .

With that said, and take this as an advice, don't set a precedent in a relationship with you paying more without having a good talk with your SO. \n\nLet him know how you feel because this is a relationship.

Maybe try to explain that to him.", "NTA. If you think you are, then by your logic, he's been an AH on your birthday for years. He's 40, he knows what he's doing, and he doesn't care. You do you, but I wouldn't stay with someone who can't be bothered in the best of times.", "NTA\n\nI'm living your life.  I like putting thought into gifts, where my gf does not.  I give good gifts and I usually get a bag of candy or something similarly less thought out for both Christmas and birthdays.  She wants a whole birthday week celebration, but doesn't want to give the same for any of our kids or me.  I quit doing it.  Why go all out if she isn't?  It's not worth it.  She knows it now as we've talked about it.  I suggest doing the same.  Talk about it so he knows why.", "NTA. If he wants you to put all that effort into his birthday, he needs to reciprocate. Kind of basic stuff. Like, why would you continue to go out of your way when he clearly takes it for granted? When he can never be bothered to go out of his way for you? \n\nBut, as I'm sure you know, you NEED to talk to him about it. Commnunication is important. Tell him how it makes you feel when he makes little to no effort on your birthday (less important to him, less valued) and how his disappointment this year is what you feel every year.

There is ZERO excuse for the level of laziness he\u2019s showing.  You are not his mother, you should not have to teach him to value you enough to put in effort.  The comments about you needing to communicate better are honestly disgusting, putting the onus on you for his behavior.  \n\nThe fact that you have to lower your level of partnership to show him how poorly he\u2019s taking care of you on your birthday would be a deal breaker for me.  I hope he figures out what a bonehead he\u2019s showing himself to be, and steps up as an equal partner for you.

Don't do wifey things for a guy who doesn't do husband things for you. Don't give someone your 100% if they're only giving you 25% in a relationship. Don't feel guilty for standing your ground.

Maybe all he cared was being treated to a lot of money and he is upset that it's not continuing.

It might be a good idea to keep the birthday more simple, but make your relationship anniversary the big event where both of you plan the ''fun little trip'' together.\n\nIt might also just be confusion since you did changed the birthday out of nowhere from his perspective. \n\nAnyway, use your big girl words and talk to your partner like an adult.", "YTA.

He actually expects OP to make a big deal out of his birthday yet does the bare minimum for hers every year.", "Double standards would exist as long as gender matters, because how'd we measure equality? Since the neighbour of ours is a pursueing an agressive, terrorising war against another neighbour of it, I'd like to ask, would you send ladies to compulsory army, in order to make things more equal, in order to achieve _exact_ equality. \n\nI see nothing wrong with ladies being privileged that in the world I live in. I want it to be that way. I'd love things as equal as possible, BUT I would only consider volunteering ladies on the front line IF things were to escalated. So not that ladies are great warriors for that matter. But I'd definitely let ladies have the privilege of _not_ being forced into front line war missions. \n\nI'm gonna have to agree with your point. Pointing out double standards might be necessary sometimes, but they going to have to exist. While most of the times it doesn't have to matter, but in many ways it more often does. A lot of people build their identity around it and it matters quite much atleast. No one is absolutely free of expectations, but I sure do ladies would be as free as they possibly can. We would _all_ benefit of ladies getting equal position in our society. And in all of them. \n\nWhat would you do to make things more equal?\nLet's start pursueing them ideas as a good start! :)", "I guess not on the Internet enough like everyone else because some of these terms are hilarious to me.", ">I also recommend OP remind her bf when her birthday is coming just to ensure he remembers this is his chance to make or break the relationship. Long term he shouldn't need the reminder, but once again communication helps ensure happier results.\n\nI agree with you with the exception of this part. \n\nOnce the initial conversation takes place, the onus is on the bf to take action moving forward to address the concern. Acting as a reminder for something he should already be aware of and was told specifically was a point of concern doesn't allow for him to actually put the appropriate effort into resolving the issue. Part of the problem is not putting in a reasonable level of effort and thoughtfulness into this special occasion. Part of the solution for that is remembering or setting a reminder of that occasion. That's a part of thoughtfulness.\n\nIf you were told your partner was unhappy with the effort you put into their birthday and you wanted to improve on this, would you actually need the reminder of the approaching date? Or would you make note of the next birthday and plan accordingly for it?", "dude read the thread you are replying to. OP literally says when she tries to talk to him about him not putting in enough effort he blows it up.", "And now it's being changed completely. She's no longer putting effort into *his* birthday either. She's giving herself something as well. But she's bringing him into it and he will be meeting her halfway. No one will be planning anyone's birthday *event*. That's the compromise. They will plan a couples weekend instead, together. Then, all they have to do, either of them, is focus on an individual gift. She has less pressure to go all out. And he has more time to focus on one thing instead of many.\nIt's not letting him off the hook. It's compromise.\nI have never gotten a bouquet of flowers from my husband. I've asked many times over the 11+ years we've been together, and mentioned how much I'd love to. He always answers with how they're a waste of money. Yet he has started to get me little live plants. I have a black thumb, always have had one. Can't keep a plant alive to save my life, but I like his plants. So he keeps them alive for me. That's our compromise there. He still stinks at gift giving though. I have wishlists and give him ideas, but he always goes with \"I *think* she'll like this.\" Usually it'll sit in a drawer. But I say thank you and I love his thought behind it. I do wish he'd look at the wishlists though. I tell him they're there for a reason, he just thinks lists are lazy and unimaginative. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "But it gets him involved and thinking of her. That's what she wants him to do.", "I'm glad we agree. Sorry for the novel", "Maybe I\u2019m odd, but that doesn\u2019t sound like the type of life that\u2019s very enjoyable. Barely tolerable, maybe.", "I\u2019m glad to hear she\u2019s doing so much better. As for him, can someone really be enjoying life and feeling all set if they\u2019re drinking themselves into a stupor on a regular basis? Food for thought lol", "My approach worked for me. I've been with my partner 13 years now. While yes ideally a reminder shouldn't be needed, a reminder also helps guarantee that proper action will be taken. Especially if it is many months after the original conversation about it. Better safe than sorry after all. If I give my partner birthday/holiday expectations up front he does a decent job meeting my communicated expectations. Sometimes he does a little extra just to surprise me too.\n\nOne conversation won't magically fix things either. It takes < 1min to casually mention an important date like a birthday coming up in a month or two as a reminder. If the bf messes up then he really is in trouble. If he wasn't reminded then it shows both the bf is an AH and OP still needs to learn to communicate because obviously the point was made. At that point they aren't a compatible couple.", "she says he makes that comment and then it turns into an argument. That isn't him blowing up that is the whole situation blowing up.", "No, you're still missing the point. Like sure, they could compromise and plan a trip together, but that's not going to make OP feel better about his lack of effort. She will still be taking the initiative to get the ball rolling on a trip. \n\nJust because your husband refuses to do something incredibly easy, small and cheap that you have told him point blank you'd love for him to do, doesn't mean everyone wants partners like that. Like we get it, your husband doesn't listen to you, doesn't give you gifts you want, but you're able to find a way to appreciate his lack of effort anyway. That's great. Not everyone would view that the same way.  I feel sad that your partner seems to so easily decide that your wants aren't important, but if it works for you, great. \n\nIt's ok to not want to \"meet halfway\" (which in this case would definitely be him dragging his feet to even plan half a trip). It's ok to decide that someone isn't giving you the same effort, so you're not going to put that effort into it. I would imagine this lack of effort and caring from him extends beyond just birthdays. Maybe that's something else for OP to consider.", "...you think of someone when you give them a glass of water. That doesn't exactly count, does it? He needs to think FOR her. People who love each other want to make them happy. Forcing them to think about you is not required. It literally defeats the purpose", "haha. You owe no apologies, I am verbose and admire those who have more economy of phrasing.", "\u2018it blows up into him saying \u201ci\u2019m never good enough for you!\u201d\u2019 \n\nthat\u2019s a manipulative response to someone trying to talk about the issue. that is him blowing it up."]}
