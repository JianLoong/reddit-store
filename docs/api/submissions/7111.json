I put up with her B.S. because I love my brother. But every time we\u2019re around her it\u2019s always her talking about going for a run that morning, working out, tricking some girl into filming a video with her, getting her hair or nails done, etc. Like she cannot sit down and just have a conversation.\n\nMy kids look up to their auntie, but I do try to \u201cdeprogram\u201d them whenever they\u2019re around her too much. I don\u2019t want them to grow up thinking it\u2019s normal to care what your butt looks like in leggings.\n\nWhich is how this whole thing started. We were all at mom\u2019s for dinner on Sunday and Jessica had brought some eyeshadow palette with her. She wanted to do a look for my oldest daughter. As soon as I saw it come out, I just said no. Absolutely not. My daughter got pissed and whined, but I just said no. Nuh uh. My kid is NOT going to become some talentless \u201cinfluencer\u201d \n\nJessica had the audacity to also complain. She was like \u201cOh come onnn, she asked me for this look! It\u2019s not like she hadn\u2019t worn makeup before.\u201d\n\nShe sounded like a fucking CHILD. I was just like \u201cAre you fucking serious right now? You\u2019re a literal toddler having a fucking toddler temper tantrum because I DARED to be the one to tell you no.\u201d\n\nShe said \u201cexcuse me\u201d and got up, but I wasn\u2019t done, so I just followed her and told her that nobody needs her to bring the room down every single time talking about how she \u201cgot to week 4 of her half marathon training\u201d or how she \u201crecorded a great video\u201d or whatever else. And that it\u2019ll be a cold day in hell before I let her antics rub off on my girls.\n\nShe turned around and continued the toddler temper tantrum by saying I was just jealous of her, insecure, and that people like me always want to \u201cdim\u201d peoples light. I just stared. Outside of 2nd graders, who actually throws a \u201cyou\u2019re just jealous!\u201d tantrum?\n\nShe called me a bitch and left, and I haven\u2019t stopped hearing the riot act from my brother, who says I went way too far, and that it was JUST makeup. Right, it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d makeup the way it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d counting calories until you\u2019re in a full blown spiral. He doesn\u2019t get that she is a MASSIVE problem because he\u2019s blinded by her looks and the whole \u201ccharming\u201d personality B.S. that\u2019s a key narc trait.

You don't have to like your SIL, you don't have to have the same interests or follow her lifestyle or whatever, but you \\*do\\* have a certain obligation to behave yourself around your children. What kind of an example do you think you set for them with this scenario? \n\nSIL wanting to do makeup on a niece is definitely not the catalyst for the kind of toddler meltdown you threw. You've done a wonderful attempt at describing what she said and did as ridiculous, but if you just look at her words, and more importantly her \\*actions\\*, she was so definitely the mature one here. \n\nShe brought out makeup to try out on your daughter (how old is your daughter? HAS she had makeup on before?) Your daughter verified that yes, she did want to do this. You said no (did you actually \\*say\\* the \"No, Nuh uh, talentless influencer\" part, or did you at least manage that much self-restraint?), she did a light protest, and you blew a gasket. \n\nYou start swearing at her and insulting her (in front of your kids, way to go), and when she did the adult thing of excusing herself in an attempt to de-escalate, and honestly get away from you, YOU FOLLOWED HER so you could continue to spew vitriol that you have obviously been waiting to unload on her. She attempts to defend herself, which you also insult, and SHE'S the one acting like a 2nd grader? Although honestly, 2nd grader is higher than the age of behaviour I would assign for you. \n\nYou DO sound jealous, and even if it's just a matter of being incredibly snobby and dismissive of how someone earns a living, you are mean and rude as hell.

Right, it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d makeup the way it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d counting calories until you\u2019re in a full blown spiral.

I'm laughing hysterically at you.\n\n\nYou waited and waited and waited for any small excuse to unload on her bc you don't like her. You're so jealous of her it's painfully obvious. Not wanting make up on your kiddo is ok. But you didn't have to take it that far. \n\nFollowing someone who has walked away is disgusting and bullying. You said no way I'm letting you off that easy and she didn't fight back! She made one comment and you wouldn't let it go. So she left and you followed her to harass her. If you're worried about anyone running off on your girls you should be concerned about yourself! JFC.", "YTA. Saying no to make up is fine. Following her to continue berating her? Asshole. You can not agree with or like her being an influencer without behaving in such a negative and toxic way.", "Yikes....yta. It sounds like you unleashed on her because you wanted too, and you took the first opportunity to justify it.", "YTA. It's totally normal to care what your butt looks like in leggings", "YTA you wanted to say those things to her and you were just looking for the opportunity", "ESH, you've left out important details. How old is the daughter who wanted makeup? \n\nTbh you do sound jealous and you're the one who started that argument and kept it going, all while calling her a toddler having a tantrum!", "YTA and sound jealous", ">Jessica had the audacity to also complain. She was like \u201cOh come onnn, she asked me for this look! It\u2019s not like she hadn\u2019t worn makeup before.\u201d\n\n>She sounded like a fucking CHILD.

If so, then she\u2019s TA for that. If she was just going to put makeup on your daughter for fun, then you are TA for overreacting. She\u2019s also TA for not backing off when you said no.

It\u2019s not hurting anyone, and you sound judgy and mean.", "Your SIL may not be my cup of tea either, but nowhere did you say anything she did that was malicious, or even rude before the fight you started. Her wanting to do your daughter\u2019s eye makeup even sounded kind. You overreacted. I understand wanting to teach you kids that the social media stuff is unimportant, but a lot of that comes from setting a good example yourself. YTA", "YTA. You literally chased her down yelling but have the audacity to call her the toddler. She is right you sound horribly jealous and bitter. Wearing makeup will not turn your daughter into an influencer but your horrible attitude will turn her into someone no one will want to be around", ">She said \u201cexcuse me\u201d and got up, but I wasn\u2019t done, so I just followed her and told her that nobody needs her to bring the room down every single time talking about how she \u201cgot to week 4 of her half marathon training\u201d or how she \u201crecorded a great video\u201d or whatever else.\n\n She ended the convo and you kept going. How does talking about training for a marathon or a great video bring a room down? This has me thinking that your reaction is actually what brings the room down. \n\n>But every time we\u2019re around her it\u2019s always her talking about going for a run that morning, working out, tricking some girl into filming a video with her, getting her hair or nails done, etc. Like she cannot sit down and just have a conversation.\n\nThat's... A conversation.

And I like looking at my butt in leggings. Not all pretty or charming people are narcissistics. And I say all this as a chubby ol hag. \n\nYou do, in fact sound jealous (oh, and I'm 40, not 2, but plenty capable or recognizing envy), or like you are projecting some unresolved issues.

However, nothing here suggests she threw a tantrum even after you insulted her multiple times and mocked what she does for a living. You threw a tantrum and after she excused herself politely you followed her to continue whining and insulting her.  Ding, ding PROJECTION!!!!\n\nInfo: How old is your daughter? If she's five, yeah don't put makeup on a little kid. If she's a teenager or tween, come on, she probably already has tried make-up and just wants to do it more neatly.", "YTA. Everything you described just sounds like things that many women are interested in or enjoy. So she talks about making videos, do you not talk about your job? So she cares what her butt looks like in leggings, do you not choose your clothing based on how it looks and how it makes you feel?

Take a step back and think about how your behavior comes across to others. You are a major asshole.", "YTA, interesting that you're viewing someone who is image focused as inherently being narcissistic. Like I feel like you've just pathologized all her behavior so that you could justify hating her for being an image focused woman.\n\nIt just sounds like you pointlessly hate her and are trying to find ways to ride on her in your head, and use this opportunity of her wanting to bond with your kid as your excuse to really go off on her and go on a rant that hopefully your kids will see is just based on shaming women who wear makeup? \n\nI think you should work on your catastrophizing, because wearing makeup is not a gateway into having an eating disorder and becoming a narcissist who only cares about their looks and obsesses about maintaining them. \n\nYou may not think you owe her shit, but you do, and you also owe your daughters better", "yeah YTA, even with you narrating this I'm on her side lol", "YTA.... jealous much?", "Ehh you both AH. You shouldn\u2019t criticize what she chooses to do. Just like she should have asked you permission to put make up on your kid before even letting the kid know she has it. You both don\u2019t respect each other and that\u2019s obvious. I know you love your brother but if you can\u2019t respect her and vice versa then you may have to ti LC. Or you can be an adult have a conversation with your brother present and inform her calmly and respectfully what your boundaries are in regards to your children and her content.
