All of her friends ghosted her because of her inability to communicate without shouting and screaming. As of a couple months ago, she was living on her own with her, at the time, 7 month old daughter as well as her current boyfriend. Her boyfriend who we will call Nick, had 3 children previously. They then had my niece and they were barely living. They had very little money. They were evicted from their apartment and were forced into living in my house. When they first moved in, everything seemed fine until my sister began to leave dirty dishes and food around everywhere. Blackberries on the floor, a whole gallon of milk and raw chicken breast unattended on the counter. We have 5 cats and 1 dog who are known for stealing raw or cooked chicken breasts off the counter. My mom has told her to clean up after herself because it is not her, mine, nor my fathers job to pick up her mess. Because of the food being left out, we got fruit flies. Dirty diapers were being left places and toys were everywhere. (Toys are understandable but you can at least push them to the side so no one trips over them, which I have) There\u2019s been many instances where I\u2019ve watched my niece and have not gotten a single thank you from my sister. I\u2019ve cleaned her dishes for her that were left out for a week and toys that were brought into the kitchen. She has no regard to take care of her or her daughters toys or left over food. She works part time babysitting. The child, Peter, she babysits comes to my house to be watched instead of staying at his moms. My mother suggested babysitting Peter at his moms house since my sister leaves a mess once he leaves. Instead of compromising or trying to tell my mother why she couldn\u2019t, all she said was \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work for me or his mom\u201d. That was a couple days ago.\nToday an argument broke out. My mom had asked if she spoke to Peter\u2019s mom yet about babysitting him at the mother\u2019s house and my sister said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work for us plus it\u2019s easier to watch him here.\u201d and my mom asked \u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t work for me?\u201d And my sister lost her shit. She was screaming at my mom (while holder her daughter), cussing at her with f-bombs saying she bitches about everything, for example: leaving food out, leaving the toy car in the FRONT lawn, not putting away her dirty dishes, not doing the dishes, not cleaning up crumbs found on the floor or sand tracked in from the outside. Throughout all of this my mother was silent, letting my sister go on her rant. Suddenly she turns to me and screams at me saying \u201c*NAME* was bitching about me leaving the fucking knives out on the fucking counter when I was fucking cooking and using them!\u201d I had cleaned up the utensils she was using being I was cooking at the time and it was too crowded.\n\nEDIT:\nSorry for the incomplete post and missing information.\n\nMy mother and I are both on the same page about wanting to kick my sister out.\n\nMy mom has asked my sister if she would like to try therapy many times but she has denied and even signed her up for a therapy session which she did not attend.\n\nThis is my parent\u2019s house and I am a teenager.\n\nMy sister has lashed out at family members attempting to help her with her child but only saw their suggestions as criticism.", "created_utc": 1687384477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fkoiq/aita_for_wanting_my_mother_to_kick_my_sister_and/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel bad for your niece because she is so young. I hope your sister can think about what she has done after some time.", "NTA. She's an adult and sounds like a nightmare to be around, so I don't blame you for wanting her out. You can love and support her from afar", "NTA.  Do a legal eviction. If you are able to, pay for a week at a residential hotel, move her out and change the locks. Do this before she has another baby.", "NTA and what a hellish situation for you and your mother to be living.", "NTA and you should call CPS. Let them know your sister is a danger to her child and needs to be removed from the situation. Raw chicken and milk left out? Recipe for food poisoning, which can quickly kill a child.    \nYou sister need to have something drastic happen before she will realize she needs mental health help.", "NTA! Maybe kicking your sister out will be a wake up call for her for how horrible she is she deserves to live on the streets not her baby though keep the Baby", "NtA. Sad about your niece. But your sister needs to go otherwise she\u2019ll ruin your lives", " NTA right now tell her She has NO right to cmaplain, I would have snapped already if I was in that situation, tell her to either do what is asked or GET OUT, either she does and finally shut up or she leaves ( When I first read the title I misread and thought the mom wanted to kick them out but you didn\u2019t want her too and I was thinking that you were an AH that doesn\u2019t understand the stress, but then I read the story)", "There really needs to be a serious conversation about her leaving with the child.", "You can ask, but it's her decision since it's her house.
