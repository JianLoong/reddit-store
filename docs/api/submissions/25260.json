According to the post it\u2019s a pattern.* \n\nNone of the women she talked to have gone on trips. This is a far cry from saying \"none of the other women have gone on trips\". Maybe she talked to 2 people. Maybe her department has multiple branches. Maybe it's a small company and only has 10 employees, and the other women are new/less qualified. \n\n*Smart leaders don\u2019t let this stuff develop.*\n\nI don't see how anything has \"developed\". I've worked at many jobs with primarily women in leadership positions, I didn't immediately think \"well this makes my workplace look sexist\". \n\nI don't think the manager looks sexist, I don't see ample evidence for a discrimination claim, and I think OP is setting herself up for failure here. \n\n*Have whatever take on it you want*\n\nThanks for your permission to have an opinion on the internet, I appreciate it.", "Seems like a weird thing to approach HR about in that case too. HR really doesn't care about what's good or bad for business in terms of stuff like sending people on trips. I think if OP came to them with this claim they'd laugh and tell her that her boss deals with these types of decisions. That's just my experience with about a dozen HR departments, so maybe it's different other places.\n\nEither way, I don't think HR should have been involved.", "\u2026\u2026is it really that unlikely that the 4 core people for sales calls would all be guys then? I mean the ratio of male to female employees might be suspicious by itself but I don\u2019t know your industry and some industries are heavy male or female. What makes you think gender was the deciding factor in you not getting to meet with clients? And I don\u2019t mean that in a combative manner I\u2019m seriously asking", "HR is always wrong. \n\nThe company is managing their human resources to maximize profits. Stop pretending like that is honorable.", "Have a good one.", "You literally said that bosses don\u2019t need justification for who they send on business trips. I know exactly how business works which is why I know you\u2019re wrong. If OP felt that her boss was hindering her career development, she had every right to report him. Would you have a problem if OP went to her boss\u2019s boss instead of HR? It\u2019s weird that you\u2019re defending a manger for making poor decisions and you seem to think OP should have just dealt with it.", "It\u2019s just part of the feedback that you can pass to HR about learning and development and they take it to management as a general point regarding the staff not only 1 person. Whatever happens is eventually up to management. It\u2019s usual process is a lot of companies.\n\nIn this case, it just feels that OP just pull the sexism card easily to cause some ruckus.", "Because new hire men are offered to tag along to learn, the same offer has never been extended to any women in the workplace. I was even turned down when I offered to cover my expenses just to go and observe and learn.", "You think the best strategy when you disagree with your manager's business moves is to report them to HR? Woof.\n\nAnd the boss provided justification: He's sending his 4 most capable people on the trip. The fact that you and OP feel this is a bad business move doesn't matter. He doesn't need to justify it to you or OP, only to whoever he reports to.\n\nEither way, none of this was proof of sexual discrimination or merited a HR report.", "If not a single female colleague had ever gone on one of these trips, that\u2019s a red flag.", "Yea, this was a poor decision on OP's part. I'll take your word on the HR feedback - truthfully I've found it best to avoid HR unless laws are being broken or I need something specific like Paternity leave.", "Are you saying that of the 16 men in your office besides the core four, most/all of them were offered the opportunity to shadow on sales visits with your core salesmen while none of the 5 women were when they were hired? Then obviously that\u2019s suspicious as fuck and something needs to be done about that manager NTA", "The issue here is sexual discrimination, not sexual harassment. The fact that you don\u2019t know the difference between the two is alarming. To answer your question: if I believe my professional development is being hindered for no good reason and my boss was dismissive of my concerns, I\u2019m either talking to their boss or HR. I have every right to do that. I don\u2019t have to sit by while an incompetent manager hinders my growth and I shouldn\u2019t have or resign because of it. Managers should be held accountable by their supervisors and their subordinates. Otherwise, there\u2019s a risk for abuse of power.", "1: We don't know a single female employee has never gone on these trips. \n\n2: Still wouldn't necessarily be a red flag. The majority of my job is run by women, does that mean I'm in a sexist environment too? I don't feel discriminated, but maybe I should file some reports with HR just in case?", " Not really\u2026. We don\u2019t have enough information to determine this. It could be the people start going after 4 years to this stuff, could be they were suppose to start going but business is down and they need the deals to go through and send the ones they think will push it to the line. \n\nDon\u2019t disagree that OP wants the opportunity or their favouritism. But sexism dunno. If there a new guy in and he got sent over OP, yes it is sexism for sure.", "Yes, as an example which caused me to bring it up. We have a  new hire from last month was offered to come on a trip for next month."]}
