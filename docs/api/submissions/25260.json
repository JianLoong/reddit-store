People who the boss like better are simply going to get better opportunities unless they are actually incompetent. The boss can literally just tell HR, I think the 4 men I send on the trips are my best people for the job and HR can't do anything about it unless you can prove the 4 men are serious fuck-ups in some way.\n\nYou, unfortunately, are going to have to move jobs. You've basically screwed yourself royally. Your boss and colleagues no longer trust you. They likely now believe that you will go running to HR the moment something doesn't go your way. You are never going on a trip and are going to be very limited in terms of upward mobility (if any at all).", "i agree. kick boyfriend in the nuts and tell\nhim\nto eat shit", "Dobby didn\u2019t mean to kill, not so sure about hr though", "Reddit is just a parrot regurgitating memes sometimes.

OP said she works in a male dominated field. Should she just keep bouncing from company to company until she finds one that will allow women the opportunity to advance?

What does this mean for the make-up of her company? Can I be conservative and assume there's a 3-1 male to female ratio? Is that fair? \n\n* Fact: OP says she talked to multiple other female employees about this, using words like \"they\" constantly. I'm going to give OP the benefit of the doubt here and say she didn't just talk to 2 other people because that would make some of her word choices a little off, let's say at least 3 other employees were part of this conversation. \n\nSo 3 other female employees plus OP would give us at least 4 women. A 3-1 gender ratio would give us at least a pool of 8 men (and 12 total employees), of which half are also never being allowed to go on these trips (because it's always the same 4 men, not just always men). Tossing a probability question into chat GPT tells me that were the 4 'permanent trip-takers' randomly selected there's basically a ~74% chance at least one woman would be included (and a ~26% chance no women would be). \n\nSo based on my (conservative, I think) assumptions and not even considering things like seniority, there's an explanation that involves no sexism. It may well be best for the business to always send the same people to these things as OP's boss suggests, we just don't know.
