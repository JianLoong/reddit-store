I pressed her to tell me because it bothered her so much, they've been together a while, it's not that surprising and she's nice, treats me well when we see each other and my mom never said anything about her. My mom told me that SHE was the reason for the breakup, that my dad cheated on my mom with his new wife. And she said that I was too young to remember but that this woman made our lives hell, that she sent my mom, her friends, and our family pictures of my dad next to her - the mistress. Worse, I don't remember, but my mom said she showed up at my birthday wanting to get me a present, and my dad threw her out before I saw it.\n\nOf course I was very angry, right? How would it not be, knowing that my dad did all this to my mom, I feel like I don't even really know him, the dad I know would never do something like that. When he got back from his honeymoon I didn't want to meet him or go to his house but he called my mom and talked to her about custody and she said I needed to go. And then it was shit, as soon as I got to their house he was asking me why I was upset if it was because he got married and whatever, and then his wife came to talk to me too, to see if I was okay.\n\nI wanted to ignore her but I was so angry, and as soon as I saw her I couldn't stand it, I blurted out that she should be ashamed of talking to me, of pretending that she was good, that she wasn't worth anything and that she didn't deserve my time or my attention, I said I didn't want to visit anymore because I didn't want to hang out with people like her and my dad and that my mom and I were much better than her.\n\nI know I passed the point but I was really angry. My dad lectured me, saying that this is a matter that is between him and my mom, that I can't treat people like that, no matter what the person does, but even more so I can't treat his wife that way. He said that just an AH tells anyone that you're so much better than them, that you can't say things like that. My mom called me afterward and also told me that this is not the way to behave.

It\u2019s valid that you are too. HOWEVER, she should never have sent you over to your dad\u2019s after dropping that information.

You're allowed to feel how you feel. However....I would suggest pulling your Dad aside and asking for his version of what happened. There's always 3 sides to every story.  Her version, his version, and the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle. \n\nYour Mom sounds like a good mom, but it wasn't cool her throwing you in the middle of her hurt feelings. That put you in an awkward situation you werent in before. It sounds like you used to have a good relationship with your Dads new wife. \n\nDefinitely talk to your Dad about what your Mom said and make it a point to listen to what he has to say with an open mind.

You have no idea whether or not your mom is telling you the complete story so you might want to cool your jets here because you for sure don't know everything that happened between your parents. \n\nBut hey, your mom's attempt at parental alienation has been working really good, hasn't it?", "ESH but you. Your dad and his mistress are awful people and deserved everything you said. Your mum should not have told you the way that she did, you're too young to know how to handle that kind of information. If you need distance between your dad and his mistress then I advise you take it. Do yourself a favour and don't blow up on them again, it doesn't achieve anything. Quietly disengaging from people works best, you could probably use some therapy too.", "NTA id be worried if you weren't upset. Too many times I've seen the kid take dads side & its messed up. Your dad & his wife ruined your family. If she didn't know he was married, itd be different, but she obviously knew. Sending pictures to someone's wife with you next to her husband, is fucked up & cold hearted. Your mom didn't even tell you until you pressed her.

You have every right to not want to be around him or the woman that not only broke up your family, but she also tormented her, her friends and family. That\u2019s a toxic person. It\u2019ll be funny when your dad cheats on her. If they allow it maybe take a break from going to see them for a bit. If they don\u2019t allow you to stop going then I would just stay in my room and have as minimal contact as possible.

I hope you're paraphrasing and he meant something different.  You could have handled this with more grace, but - and I mean no offense here - you're still a child. Your entire world just shifted out from underneath of you. Your relationships with family you loved and adored (including your fathers wife!) are now tainted. It's hard, for anyone at any age. \n\nDon't take what your dad said as you can't be upset about this (because your feelings are valid!), or that you can't share how you feel (time helps, gaining more life experience helps, therapy helps). If you start suppressing this and don't find a healthy outlet, it's a gateway to self destruction and finding solace in poor relationships. Sometimes people do deserve to be told off, because what they did was terrible. A blanket statement indicating otherwise can be so damaging, and I'm really upset your father said that to you.", "Nta I'd wanna know why my parents split", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe did NOTHING to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd stay out of your parents relationship ... you only know ONE side.", "NTA - Your father and his (now married) mistress lecturing you on how to treat people properly is high comedy.\n\nLife is about making choices and living with the consequences.  Your father and his mistress made their choices.  Now you get to make yours.", "NTA, as a teen getting things off your chest through telling adults how it is , is 100% the safest outlet for that anger. Don\u2019t let them gaslight you into believing that you need to bottle these feelings up, especially your mom who kinda started all of this by telling you in the first place. It\u2019s not cool at all. It became your business as soon as she shared it with you.", "NTA. Was it wrong of your mom to dump it on you? Yeah. Is this something that affected you in the end? Absolutely. You dad is wrong for a lot of reasons. Tough situations like this, kids always end up hurt the most. It should have been explained in a way that wasn't meant to hurt you.\n\nYou're so young and an outburst like that, though wrong, it doesn't make you an A-hole. It means you are hurting and need guidance. Not even a lecture or punishment, that's a heavy thing to carry for anyone.", "Exactly. \u2018It doesn\u2019t involve you,\u2019 except that it was her family ripped apart so it really does. It\u2019s her having to swap households on a regular basis, her not having a nuclear family and her listening to her mother moan about her father. So it really does involve her since it changed her entire life. Dad and step-mother don\u2019t like the consequences of their actions apparently, they just want OP to play happy families and then they can forget their guilt.

There's no way to know if she's even telling the truth (I've seen many cases where people were accused of having affairs with people they didn't even know at the time that the marriage was ending).", "Wouldn\u2019t it be weirder if the mom showed her proof of what, dirty text messages between dad and step mom? That\u2019s absolutely inappropriate to show a 14 year-old. I agree mom is the AH in this situation but she does not need to provide proof to a 14 year-old.", "The mom is an AH for dumping a ton of intense adult information on her kid then getting angry at her kid for lashing out at the people their mom basically painted as demons", "No, there's no mention, but she did say some things that the dad would've questioned if he didn't know what she was talking about.", "Since dad's defense was that it wasn't OP's business, not that any of it is untrue, I'd say mom was being honest.\n\nThat said, she probably shouldn't have given quite so many details. OP at her age should know the basics of what happened imo, but it sounds like mom got emotional and went a little too far. Humans do."]}
