I grew up in a well off family with two loving parents and I understood quickly how lucky I was. I always had a pretty good relationship with my parents as I grew up an only child. I got rather lucky out of high school and got into a career paying more than most 40 year olds make at 19. I was working saving money to buy a home by 23. They knew this goal and supported me. I thought I was easy to live with for the most part. I Kept my areas clean, I worked nights so they had alone time a good 3-5 nights a week.  I still took part time college classes while working 45-50 hours a week. And I was saving lots of money and had a clear goal. Right before I turned 21 they started dropping hints about me moving out, which caught me off guard because they knew and I knew what I was doing. I recognized how lucky I was to grow up with this environment but I was also working extremely hard  to set myself up. 45-50 hours a week in a stressful job overnight. No weekends or holidays off. I was sacrificing a social life and a healthy life for this goal of buying a house. By the time I turned 21 I was being told that I need to move out in two months, not really an option anymore. No clear reason why besides \u201c Its just time \u201c. I understand they have that right but was upset and hurt for the change with no clear reason. I was doing a lot but was still another year of saving away from being able to buy a house. Instead I had to get a  apartment alone for a year, its expensive where I am so with rent/bills from this its over $2500 which isn\u2019t a huge deal with the money I make but is really unfortunate  and will set me back 2-3 years more in saving for a house.\n\nThey were mostly supportive besides basically kicking me out out of nowhere. They helped me move my stuff ( 15-20 minutes away ) and I moved out two months ago. We still talk on the phone 3-4 days a week and everything is mostly fine but deep down I am hurt and resentful towards them. Still respectful and grateful for everything they gave me but not getting a reason and setting me back almost out of nowhere hurts. I dont know if it was jealousy for me doing something at this age they couldn\u2019t or if I was insufferable without knowing it? My mom has started to invite me over for dinner or for whatever and I usually decline even If I am not doing anything. I have gone over a few times in the last 2 months for 15-20 minutes but never for a dinner or anything. The same happened yesterday and I declined. I get a text from my dad saying your hurting her feelings. I feel bad but I am also angry because its always about them, nobody asks me how I am doing or realizes how hurt I was. Maybe its just too soon and I dont want to go visit them or maybe I am just a petty asshole, I am not sure.\n\nEdit 1: I have talked to them, they know how I feel and why. My issue isn\u2019t moving out I was more than capable of doing it and I enjoy living alone now. My problem is the guilt tripping for not wanting to visit so quickly. They helped me build a plan when I first got the job  and for them to abandon it with no clear explanation feels wrong to do to your only child but I understand its entirely possibly they changed their mind and wanted to live alone which is fine. I didn\u2019t complain and moved out right away. I just want some space without feeling bad about myself. That is the main issue. Looking at my calls and texts I realize I was downplaying how much contact they were making. I have a call from them almost every day. And invited to come over multiple times a week for the last month. I am very grateful for what they did for me.\n\nEdit 2: I want to also make it clear that I owned my own car. Paid for my own food/phone/gas/insurance/trips/clothes. I paid for basically everything besides rent.

Unless you are leaving out a lot of information (did you hold wild parties nightly? j/k) they just decided out of the blue that it was time for you to move out. That's odd. And doing that to you pushed back your well thought out plans 2 to 3 years, that's awful. I can't imagine doing that to my kids.", "Info. I know they knew about that goal but did they ever explicitly agree to housing you until you turned 23.", "NTA. They pushed you out before you were ready and are now trying to reel you back in before you are ready. Keeping a good distance is a good idea. Parents aren\u2019t owed your affection if they refuse to show you any. Move on, pick up the pieces and keep low contact.", "NTA-Feelings are never the reason for anyone being an AH. \n\nI encourage you to be the adult they want and talk to them honestly & calmly. \u201cWell I\u2019m trying my hardest to get over the hurt I feel too.\u201d \n\nThey need to know why you\u2019re hurting. Tell them that you felt kicked out; it has set you back years, and you are working to get over it. It\u2019s just going to take some time. Be sure to mention that you understand that they were well within their right to make the decision they made, but that doesn\u2019t change that you feel hurt by it.", "NTA - I get parents giving \"failure to launch\" kids a push to get them moving, but you were doing a very darn good job of adulting all on your own, with a solid plan in place around your financials, etc., that reallly made sense.  If your parents' goal was to be rid of you at age 21, they could have communicated that so that you could have planned accordingly.  You commented about possible jealousy that you have made this kind of progress more quickly than they did and it could be that.  I would have been thrilled to have a child acting so responsibly and with such a good roadmap and been glad to support that with something as low impact as the situation they had with you.\n\nThey may realize that their cold \"You are 21, get gone and go waste lots of money on rent in the worst housing market the country has seen in years, too bad, so sad\" routine has damaged the relationship they had with you.  Sadly, what is broken doesn't get fixed just because the ones who broke it decide they don't like the consequences of their actions.   Just as they had the right to throw you out with so little notice, you have the right to be saddened and hurt.  Take the time to settle into your independence and try to find some time for a non-parental social life.  They don't get to have things be all better just because they want it that way.", "I feel like there has been a major lack of communication between you and your parents. Both in regards to them really explaining the genuine reasons for wanting you to move out (and for the super short notice), but also with you not expressing how hurt you feel by that, and how that has affected you, and your desire to spend time with them. I really feel like there is more to them asking you to move out than they have told you. \nYou\u2019re NTA, but I think you should be honest with them about why you\u2019re not spending time with them, then maybe they\u2019ll be honest with you. \nGood luck!!", "NTA.  I'm sure lots of people will call you out for living at home that long rent free but you are just fortunate to have parents who can afford that.  Getting asked to move out suddenly with no reason can certainly be confusing.  Also its not like you don't speak to your parents you just aren't going over often.  You might be a little petty but hey we all are petty at times.  It feels good.", "NTA. If they wanted you to move out as soon as you turned 21 they needed to give you more than 2 months notice (and dropping hints does *not* count as proper notice). After all, it wasn't like you were sitting around the house playing video games. It's reasonable that you would harbor some resentment and it would take some time for your relationship to heal, if ever. And talking on the phone, inviting you to dinner, and pretending like nothing happened isn't going to fix things. Your father can text you about how you are hurting your mother's feelings all day long, but he isn't dealing with how they hurt yours.", "Nta, based on what you've said. Sorry things happened that way. I feel like you were behaving in a very adult and mature manner, and it might have been nice for them to reward you by letting you live at home and keep saving money.\n\nThey aren't necessarily assholes for what they did, but in your position I would also feel resentful.", "You can spend time with whoever you want to. But there's something that's not being said. You may not know it but there's more to the story. Find it\n\nNTA.", "You aren't just hurt and it isn't petty or anything even if you are. What are are is someone who had their trust broken. You trusted your parents. And they took an action that hurt you for no stated reason. They knew it was going to hurt you and throw a wrench into the plans they were aware of and had apparently supported until ... suddenly they didn't.\n\nIf you can, perhaps in writing if that feels easier/better, communicate this to your parents. You love them, you appreciate the support, but then they yanked that support for no reason they would explain and so how can you trust them? You are hurt and need time. The love isn't gone, but the liking ... the liking isn't there right now. And you need time to heal from them hurting you and essentially saying \"we don't care if this hurts you, we are doing it anyway\". \n\nNTA", "INFO: in your post you say \u201cright before I turned 21\u201d but in comments you say they started mentioning you moving out at 21 6 months prior. Which is it?\n\nRight now I\u2019m leaning toward ESH due to communication and the lack of sitting down together to clearly discuss each other\u2019s expectations and wishes. They should have sat you down to ask how long you expected to stay and how long they were willing to have you stay, and you could have done the same to express how long you were hoping to stay and what it would help you achieve.", "NAH - your goal is YOUR goal. Their prerogative is theirs.", "NTA\n\n\"A few times in the last 2 months\" already sounds like enough for someone who's already moved out. If they wanted you to be around often then they should've just... not kicked you out? When kids move out it's pretty common to not meet up with the parents that often because they have their own work and their own lives to tend to.\n\nI'm not saying that you should never see them, I'm saying that it sounds like you've already been visiting them frequently enough.\n\nAlso, are your parents fairly lovey-dovey? I wonder if they just wanted you out so they could return to a more NSFW lifestyle. I've heard stories of some parents kicking out their kids at 18 just so they can fuck whenever they want.", "NTA - but your parents are for the way they did this.\n\nMy son is in his mid 20s, and I started having conversations with him about expectations for him becoming an adult and what that means when he was a senior in high school and going off to college to become an engineer.  We would revisit him taking over more responsibility as he got older, and it was always a discussion of what i wanted transitioned to him and why.  For example, I made it clear to him that when he graduated from college, he needed to have a job lined up and he needed to find a place to live.  My reasoning as I explained it to him was I wanted to downsize out of the house and move to somewhere with more opportunities for activities than where we lived.  He also needed to start his own life in his own space.  This is what I did when I was his age.  So it wasn\u2019t a surprise and it was because both of us had different paths to take now that he was an adult and self sufficient and I was an empty nester.\n\non buying a house\u2026 his uncle encouraged him to do that, but I strongly discouraged it for several reasons.  For one, he didn\u2019t know if his job was going to work out, and buying a house is a big long term commitment.  Renting an apartment is a short term (1 year commitment), so if it\u2019s a mistake, it\u2019s recoverable.  If it\u2019s not the right location, you can move when the lease is up.  When you by a house, you own doing all the house maintenance.  So as a young 20 something, you should be free to be going out, hanging out with friends, hobbies, adventures, dating, etc.  having a house to maintain will consume a lot of your time that could be spent enjoying life.  My son rented for a year, didn\u2019t like the location, looked for a new rental, couldn\u2019t find one, bought a condo because his job has stabilized and he found an area he loved, which Was perfect for him because it is fairly low maintenance leaving him free time for his hobbies and girlfriend.  I am not suggesting you need to do the same, but I have see 20 something\u2019s his age wait to buy a house and then are consumed with house maintenance leaving them no time to get out and enjoy life as a young 20 something.\n\nyou are an adult now, and your parents are treating you like a child.  its time to respond to them like the adult that you are.  Dad, you and mom decided that I needed to live on my own.  Well, I am, but that also means that i don\u2019t have time to spend with you because I have adult responsibilities.  Politely, but firmly.  Dad, I am sorry mom is upset, but I am an adult and you asked me to leave to be on my own.  mom\u2018s job of raising me is over and she needs to start the next chapter of her life, just like you told me to do.\n\nyou need to decide how often you want to interact with them now that you have moved out.  I would strongly suggest that talking to them 3-4 times a week is too much.  They need to learn to be empty nesters, and you need to get busy with your life and meeting up with friends,etc.  I would suggest a timeout of a month with no contact to decompress and let go of the hurt from the way the booted you.  And then you need to think about how often you want to,see the,, which is maybe once a month for dinner.  It will never be as much as they want, and that ok because that\u2019s the circle of life.  You grow up, move out, and build your own life.\n\nhope this helps.", "NTA. OP, you sound like you have a lot of anger and resentment against your parents for kicking you out, but you never had a proper conversation with them. You need to sit them down and tell them that kicking out of the house without any notice had caught you off guard. Your parents probably thought that since you are earning well and independent, you didn't need to be under the home anymore. However, I think you should clear the air and explain how you feel. I hope your relationship will eventually improve.", "\"my dad saying your hurting her feelings.\"\n\nBut no respect for *your* feelings?\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were grateful and you didn\u2019t take advantage of their generosity. The disconnect is that they didn\u2019t validate what you were doing and it hurt you.

Turn it around and appreciate what they have done for you. Gave you a loving home, guided you to a great future so much that you were 'earning more at 19' than most forty years old and a good education. Then, they encouraged you to leave before giving you a timeframe. It seems to me you wanted to live off them to save for a house to buy in a few years, as if they haven't already done so much. While ideal maybe they decided it was time for you to go your own way because that's what parents do.

Lay out the fact that while you\u2019re appreciative of the life they gave you, you were struggling to understand why they kicked you out in the manner they did.
