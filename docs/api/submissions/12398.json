A wedding gift should be something both partners can benefit from. Tommy\u2019s comments were rude and entitled and he shouldn\u2019t have said those things within earshot of your best friend.

Stuff they prefer, that\u2019s the whole point of a gift registry.

Your present was something you buy for a birthday not a wedding.", "ESH Giving what would've been a nice birthday present as a wedding gift was a faux pas.

You were rude but pressing the issue is petty.", "ESH -\nI\u2019ve been the receiver of a personal gift on my wedding day.

Yes, theoretically people should be appreciative of any gift, but a wedding gift should be for the couple, not just one person.

Tommy shouldn't have reacted that way, but the fact is that when you buy a present to take to a wedding, it should be a present that the couple will both enjoy and/or find useful. Remember, engaged couples fill out the wedding registry ***together***, so getting something off of that list is the safest bet. While your gift was very heartfelt, it would have been better suited as a birthday present for her or perhaps a pre-wedding gift. Also, as a major bookworm, if I were to choose between receiving some first editions of my favorite books (which would be pretty pricey) and something more useful like cookware or crockery, I would choose the more useful gift because that would be something I could use on a regular basis without fear of destroying and ruining a very rare book. One final thing, if you're getting a gift for a couple, you really should think about both of them and not just the person you're closest to.", "ESH - Getting your friend books is a super thoughtful gift, but wedding gifts should be for the couple, not just one half of the couple. You're not obligated to give a gift at all, let alone one off the registry, but it's kind of generally rude to give a gift that only applies to one of them. \n\nThat said, *his* reaction is super over the top. Also, it's weird that he's telling your best friend that you're a pretentious asshole.", "YTA. You bought a gift for your friend, not the couple.

Who knows the couple better than THE COUPLE THEMSELVES? You know, the people who chose what to go on the registry?

Your intentions were clearly good, and Tommy is for sure an AH for the reaction if it was actually that severe, but wedding registries are thoughtfully built lists made by the couple with things that they feel are needed/wanted in their new life together.

You don\u2019t know them well, you only know one of them well.  You got her a present.  What did you get Tommy?  A big, fat nothing.  You should have looked at the registry to see what to get THEM as a couple, and saved the books for a birthday or Christmas.", "YTA. That\u2019s a great birthday present. Not a wedding gift.", "YTA. You get gifts for the couple at a wedding. If you only wanted to get a gift for her, you could have given it to her separately before the wedding. I literally just did this for a close GF. I gave her a present from me the week before the wedding and gave her and the husband something off the registry. If you can\u2019t afford both, then you should only do the gift for both.", "Oh please. NTA. We had people not even get us a card. We are still friends with those people.

You gave a meaningful gift to a dear friend. Once you are married you do not stop being separate people. You don\u2019t know her husband well, you gave a gift to celebrate her as your friend on her wedding day. It\u2019s so sad her husband can\u2019t appreciate this. Couples should be happy when their partner is happy.

If he dares complain on public everyone will see he's an idiot, and you have all these arguments to back you up. \n\nHowever I'd say keep an eye out for your friend Maria. She could very well have married a narcissist adult crybaby which can lead to a lot of pain.

He obviously got so many other things, he just sounds like he is mega greedy to be upset about something like that.", "NTA, but your best friend is. Why would she tell you what Maria's new husband had said? You can't go back and change the gift. And quite frankly, you're not obligated to buy anybody anything.

Also, your \"friend\" shouldn't have told you what he said.", "YTA. He was rude, but right. The point of a registry is to get a couple set up with things they need/want for their new home. \n\nI personally think anyone that goes off registry is rude (unless you\u2019re giving cash or a giftcard), because you\u2019re telling the couple that you know what they need/want better than they do.

I didn\u2019t have anything in my registry that we both don\u2019t use. And every other registry has had stuff that I would assume both members of the couple would be using.

You\u2019re referencing a book that was written at a time when men and women weren\u2019t considered equal partners in a marriage. Our society no longer abides by that belief.
