Either something happened to him mentally or tricked me into marriage by giving me something he knew I wanted. \n\nAgain take that at face value because that\u2019s how I would think since I come from a culture in which marriage makes you have a right to each other and we are happy with the way that is.", "Geez.

If the answer is yes you would even if you don\u2019t feel fat and disgusting than you should double down and tell him to stop or as what another person said, use his body the same way he uses your body, do to him the same things he does, or just keep on arguing with him till he gets the point. \n\nIf you would like it if you did not feel fat and disgusting, than you should kinda be happy that your husband is into you even if you don\u2019t feel that great about yourself and how you look is irrelevant to why he is doing it.

Or are you just hellbent on proving yourself right, if OP has a problem with our opinion on the matter than she should say so herself not you, furthermore if such a topic is sensitive coming online and asking a plethora of people is bound to get you mixed responses. If that is something she does not want she should not have come online and ask such a question.\n\nAnd if you are not mature enough to understand other peoples point of view that is your own problem and not mine. No where have i said that poor self esteem is more important than someone treating his wife as property nor did I or any other redditors who is saying things similar to what i am saying have in any way shape or form agree to that point.\n\nWhat we are saying is that OP explicity said that she feels fat and disgusting whenever her husband touches her and pointing out that her self esteem could be another cause to her reaction towards her husbands action\n\nNote here that i said \u201ccould be another cause\u201d \u201ccould be\u201d \u201canother\u201d not \u201c this is the reason why and you should let your husband do as he wishes. \n\nTo be honest with all this rage and determination you have to comment on our replies to OP makes me believe you have unsolved truama that you need adressing and are using us as an outlet\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "at least for this point so far, i dont see any downvotes and if so hopefully my +1 brings its back up a bit. but they have minimized ur post which is stupid af on reddit. i agree on ur stance as well.", "I agree completely", "Hello, reddit woman. I still disagree with you.  The first sentence OP says she does not like her ass being touched, it is not a turn on, and it upsets her.  The MAIN ISSUE is that her husband is ignoring her consent and treating her like property. It's fucking 2023, not 1692.  \n\n\nYou people are the only ones reducing the issue to OP's body image.", "Are you fucking for real? Married people are assaulted by their spouses all the time. Don\u2019t victim blame. Seek therapy", "he\u2019s the one physically assaulting her!!! saying he can do what he wants because she\u2019s his wife? touching her and doing things to her knowing she doesn\u2019t like it and has continuously asked him to stop? but okay she does something back to him and she\u2019s in the wrong for teaching him a lesson about not touching people places they don\u2019t wanna be touched. real nice logic here", "Maybe he needs to find someone else if he\u2019s incapable of not fucking sexually harassing his wife", "Omfg.\n\nOP's husband is sexually assaulting her. He even said \"I'll do as I please.\" Don't give him a fucking pass.\n\nAt the same time, escalating the situation by retaliating with more violence is definitely not the right solution. OP will end up dead.\n\nWhat the actual fuck, r/AmITheAsshole? I thought the hive mind was better than this.", "So to remove physical assault and make it even, she should shove a finger in his starfish every chance she gets? This example only applies if he doesn't like it. She should have just as much right to touch him in ways he doesn't enjoy as he does to her. I actually agree this isn't the way but sometimes ppl struggle to understand how they are making ppl feel until they are put in the same situation.", "Because you just called me a disgusting \u201chumanbeing\u201d. Did you want me to be nice to you after that? Oh sorry. You\u2019re a great person. Have a beautiful day full of sunshine and rainbows.", "I never said married people don\u2019t experience assault. I\u2019m saying your dumb ass logic makes no sense. You\u2019re saying that she should just start physically abusing him. Make it nice and even, right? Makes no sense.", "Yeah because it makes so much more logical sense to start physically abusing your partner to \u201cteach them a lesson.\u201d Let me guess, you hit kids too? And think it\u2019s good for them to grow up and be nice and strong and mentally ill\u2026 I mean emotionally stable. If there is any physical abuse or physical assault going on, OP should just leave the relationship. She isn\u2019t changing and neither is he. Clearly.", "But she should choose to stay ?? He should go find someone else but she should just stay and start physically abusing him. Okay.", "I know I am!! thanks", "No I\u2019m saying she should defend herself by any measure necessary", "He isn\u2019t listening, he isn\u2019t respecting her or her body, he won\u2019t stop. What he\u2019s doing has nothing to do with love, it\u2019s harassment and control.", "Dude. Lol.", "Clearly you don\u2019t see women as equal partners", "Fucking defending yourself when you\u2019re being assaulted is self defense not abuse fighting back is absolutely fair game", "Wouldn\u2019t have to defend herself if she just left. Problem solved", "Read any article or watch any interview of anyone who has experienced sexual assault in a relationship. The myth of \"they would just leave if it's bad enough\" is exceptionally overused and NOT REASONABLE. It is sometimes extraordinarily difficult to leave an abusive relationship out of fear for their/their children's safety if they left, lack of financial resources or support, and so many other things. Abusers control the abused, often isolate them, take away spending power, and make it very difficult to leave. Please please read some materials on sexual assault.", "just because it is difficult doesnt mean it shouldnt be done. if they dont respect u, leave. at this point, OP is not respecting themselves. for all pf those resorting to physical violence, its people like u, who are part of the problem. both are AH.", "FOR THE SEATS IN THE BACK"]}
