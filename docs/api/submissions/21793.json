My mom died when I was only 2 years old. So for the majority of my life, it's just been my dad and I. Well, he passed away 3 months ago it has been really difficult not having my dad around. I miss him so much (I'm in therapy which has helped but it's still so difficult).  \n\nWell, I now live with my grandparents on my dad\u2019s side. My grandma and Grandpa are 63 and 64 years old. They were both able to retire in their 50s and are in good health so they're able to do a lot. Growing up my grandparents always had me and my cousins over for sleepovers and just do different activities with us and sometimes even take us on vacations or road trips. \n\nWell, for whatever reason my cousins who are around my age (the ones I'm talking about are 15 and two 13-year-olds)  are convinced I'm so lucky I'm able to live with grandma and grandpa now. When in reality I rather have my dad around. I still get the typical grandchild treatment but they also have to do things like take me to practice, appointments, and soon school. Which they rarely did before. I also have chores and stuff now so definitely not like a constant sleepover and my grandparents. \n\nWell, last week my grandparents and I went on a couple of day road trip/ vacation to a small beach town it was fun. Well, yesterday a few of my Aunts, uncles, and cousins came over. My cousins are the ones who mention me going on the road trip with our grandparents I just said yeah it was fun. They started going on about how lucky I am and how much fun it is to be able to live with grandma and grandpa, how they bet I get to do fun stuff all the time. I finally got tired of it and said no it isn't all fun actually I rather have my dad and mom alive than live with grandma and grandpa. Well, I said it pretty loud so everyone heard me. My aunts (dad\u2019s sisters) got mad and called me ungrateful for everything my grandparents do for me  And said I'm acting like a selfish brat. My grandparents themselves said they understand what I was saying and it's not that I'm ungrateful for my grandparents I just rather have my dad still around. My aunts still keep calling me ungrateful and I'm just acting like an AH now. so AITA.", "created_utc": 1688936830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v9u94/aita_for_telling_my_cousins_i_rather_have_alive/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They see that you live with the \"fun\" grandparents who they always have a blast visiting.  Your aunt shouldn't have said that you were ungrateful and should address her children.  I am sorry for your loss.  I'm glad you had your grandparents to take you in, but that doesn't make in for the parents being gone.", "NTA. Ignore you aunt who is an A and clearly did not raise her kids well. Wishing for you parents to be alive does not mean you are ungrateful for for your grandparents, who sound amazing and understanding.", "First, I'm so very sorry for your loss.  NTA, because those kinds of comments are in very poor taste.  Is there a chance that your cousins didn't weren't even thinking in the context of you losing both of your parents when they said that?  Is it possible that they were just simply thinking of all of the \"fun\" you get to have with them?  At the age that y'all are, I could easily see that being their thought process, especially if they haven't experienced loss themselves.  Your aunt sucks for her reaction.", "You and your Grandparents are NTA - your aunt is a flaming one though.  Your cousins, if they haven't experienced loss the way you have, truly have no way to even begin to understand.", "NTA!!! You put your cousins in their place and they deserved it. You\u2019re grown aunts are AH for not even considering how it all must feel. Give it time and it will blow over. You weren\u2019t in the wrong at all.", "NTA - 13 and 15 sound like the perfect age to learn how to act like human beings but from the actions of your aunt we can all see exactly why they haven't learned yet.", "Omg NTA. I'm so sorry you had to go through so much at such a young age. Your aunt is so immature what is wrong with adults nowadays. It doesn't sound like you're ungrateful for your grandparents but seriously calling a child ungrateful because they wish their parents were alive what a monster.", "For what you are going through, no.... you are NTA. But.... your cousins are not understanding what it is like or you. They only know that they have fun when they go over so to live with them and have all the fun is what they are reacting to.", "NTA. First of all, I am so sorry and you have my sympathies.\n\nI think your cousins were being thoughtless, but you were justified saying what you did. Your cousins are old enough to learn some empathy for what other people are going through, and especially to not say things that might increase the pain that others are going through. And your Aunt should have supported you on it. I think parents like her, where she supports her kids no matter what, especially when they do dumb things, is what creates entitled and rude adults. In fact, much like your aunts are acting right now.\n\nYou are the one who suffered the most loss at this point, and all your aunts can worry about is that you spoke harshly to their entitled kids. They are the adults - they are the ones who should be supporting you in your time of loss. No sane person believes that you are ungrateful to your grandparents.", "NTA\n\nPlease listen to your grandparents and not the (weirdly and inappropriately) jealous rantings of your cousins and their parents.  Your grandparents know.  They understood exactly what you were saying.  They understand better than anyone how the situation has changed and that you're not just on permanent vacation with them.  You miss your dad, and the relationship you never even got to have with your mom.  Of *course* you do.  Your grandparents would like to have him still, too.\n\nThey know you love and appreciate them, and it's clear they love you.  Your relatives' comments warranted your response.  Please don't take to heart the crap they're saying.", "NTA in any way", "NTA your aunts are pure evil", "NTA. Absolutely NTA! Of course you would rather have your parents, that does not mean that you\u2019re ungrateful and I\u2019m glad that your grandparents understand. Your aunt and cousins must be lucky enough never to have experienced the loss of someone they love, if they can see that loss as being \u2018lucky\u2019 if it brings material advantage. Since they lost and uncle and brother it does not say much for their character IMHO. Please ignore them, and hug your grandparents extra tight. I\u2019m am sorry to you and to them for your loss, I\u2019m glad that you are all trying to live the best life you can in spite of that loss and I\u2019m sure your father would be too", "NTA\n\nYour aunts have done that thing where a person hears something, interprets it one way, and no matter what people tell them, they think they got it right. Obviously, you are grateful to have your grandparents, but your aunts probably didn't hear the beginning where your cousins were saying you were lucky to \"get\" to live with your grandparents.\n\nThey like only heard you say you want your dad, and they think you're being disrespectful towards your grandparents, not realizing that you were just trying to correct what your cousins were saying.\n\nYour cousins are only looking at it from how much fun they have with your grandparents and not from the point of view of no longer having your mom and, more importantly now, your dad. They are envious of how you get to have fun with your grandparents more than they do. It's also quite possible, as many kids do, that they wish they lived with someone other than their parents, without realizing what that actually means, and only looking at it from a very narrow viewpoint.\n\nI'm much older than you, and lost my mom a few years ago and I still wish she was here, even though my life has gone on and is, in many ways, better than when she was alive. Regardless, I do not consider myself lucky, because I still don't have my mom anymore. It's hard, and I'm sorry you have to go through the loss of your parents at such a young age. Just remember that your grandparents understand you and that the rest of them can all kick rocks if they don't want to take the time to understand you.", "NTA ignore your aunts, they are old enough to know better.  Your cousins I give some grace, they don't seem to understand that it's not all fun.  \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA- sorry about your dad and mom.", "NTA\n\nYou missing your parents does not take away from you loving your grandparents. \n\nI'd say your cousins are more ignorant than AHs.\nYour aunts and uncles ought to know better though!\n\nI don't think it would do any harm to reassure your grandparents that you realise and appreciate all they do for you, but don't feel guilty from wanting your parents, even just your dad.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss OP. \nWherever your parents are right now, I'm sure they couldn't be any more proud of the empathic and thoughtful young woman you are growing up to be.", "NTA at all.

I'm very sorry for your loss.", "NTA\nMy heart aches for you. You have lost the two most important people in your life, at a far too early age.\nYou are grieving the loss of your father, so your feelings are perfectly fine, and if your aunt, forgive me for saying so, has so little insight and is so immature that she cannot see, that you of course not are ungrateful that you now living with your grandparents, she's an a**hole in my book.\nI understand you 100%, and I'm sure your cousins haven't thought this through at all, although maybe they should. They are not that young. They only see and compare what you all previously had with your grandparents.\nI wish you all the best in the future.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sure grandparents feel the same.  Your aunts are the assholes.  Who in their right mind tries to make someone feel guilty for missing their parents", "NTA. You lost your father only 3 months ago\u2014you\u2019re still going through it and hearing that you\u2019re \u201cso lucky\u201d is OF COURSE going to be upsetting!\n\nYour aunt is a piece of work.
