My mom died when I was only 2 years old. So for the majority of my life, it's just been my dad and I. Well, he passed away 3 months ago it has been really difficult not having my dad around. I miss him so much (I'm in therapy which has helped but it's still so difficult).  \n\nWell, I now live with my grandparents on my dad\u2019s side. My grandma and Grandpa are 63 and 64 years old. They were both able to retire in their 50s and are in good health so they're able to do a lot. Growing up my grandparents always had me and my cousins over for sleepovers and just do different activities with us and sometimes even take us on vacations or road trips. \n\nWell, for whatever reason my cousins who are around my age (the ones I'm talking about are 15 and two 13-year-olds)  are convinced I'm so lucky I'm able to live with grandma and grandpa now. When in reality I rather have my dad around. I still get the typical grandchild treatment but they also have to do things like take me to practice, appointments, and soon school. Which they rarely did before. I also have chores and stuff now so definitely not like a constant sleepover and my grandparents. \n\nWell, last week my grandparents and I went on a couple of day road trip/ vacation to a small beach town it was fun. Well, yesterday a few of my Aunts, uncles, and cousins came over. My cousins are the ones who mention me going on the road trip with our grandparents I just said yeah it was fun. They started going on about how lucky I am and how much fun it is to be able to live with grandma and grandpa, how they bet I get to do fun stuff all the time. I finally got tired of it and said no it isn't all fun actually I rather have my dad and mom alive than live with grandma and grandpa. Well, I said it pretty loud so everyone heard me. My aunts (dad\u2019s sisters) got mad and called me ungrateful for everything my grandparents do for me  And said I'm acting like a selfish brat. My grandparents themselves said they understand what I was saying and it's not that I'm ungrateful for my grandparents I just rather have my dad still around. My aunts still keep calling me ungrateful and I'm just acting like an AH now. so AITA.", "created_utc": 1688936830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v9u94/aita_for_telling_my_cousins_i_rather_have_alive/", "score": 1416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cousins, if they haven't experienced loss the way you have, truly have no way to even begin to understand.", "NTA!!! You put your cousins in their place and they deserved it.

You weren\u2019t in the wrong at all.", "NTA - 13 and 15 sound like the perfect age to learn how to act like human beings but from the actions of your aunt we can all see exactly why they haven't learned yet.", "Omg NTA. I'm so sorry you had to go through so much at such a young age. Your aunt is so immature what is wrong with adults nowadays. It doesn't sound like you're ungrateful for your grandparents but seriously calling a child ungrateful because they wish their parents were alive what a monster.", "For what you are going through, no.... you are NTA.

First of all, I am so sorry and you have my sympathies.\n\nI think your cousins were being thoughtless, but you were justified saying what you did. Your cousins are old enough to learn some empathy for what other people are going through, and especially to not say things that might increase the pain that others are going through. And your Aunt should have supported you on it. I think parents like her, where she supports her kids no matter what, especially when they do dumb things, is what creates entitled and rude adults. In fact, much like your aunts are acting right now.\n\nYou are the one who suffered the most loss at this point, and all your aunts can worry about is that you spoke harshly to their entitled kids.

They are envious of how you get to have fun with your grandparents more than they do. It's also quite possible, as many kids do, that they wish they lived with someone other than their parents, without realizing what that actually means, and only looking at it from a very narrow viewpoint.\n\nI'm much older than you, and lost my mom a few years ago and I still wish she was here, even though my life has gone on and is, in many ways, better than when she was alive. Regardless, I do not consider myself lucky, because I still don't have my mom anymore. It's hard, and I'm sorry you have to go through the loss of your parents at such a young age.

At most they maybe trying not to talk about the elephant in the room.\n\nYour aunt is a total AH, just offended her kids look like spoiled brats who don\u2019t appreciate her being alive maybe and projecting. I\u2019d generally not expect much from people like that except opinions that highlight their views and wants, or image. Whether they realize they\u2019re doing it or not, it\u2019s not your problem. Please don\u2019t let that kinda person weigh on you - especially over this!!! \n\nYou deserve the grandparents you got because they understand you and your needs. Indeed take solace in that, but I fully see and acknowledge what you mean as it will never replace your parents or that want and need for them. I wish you the best of life moving forward, may this be the worst of your future. \n\nAnd remember grief has no timeline, just the wrong audience sometimes. You did the right thing by checking which noise to shut out - shut out your aunt in this case. F that noise. Know your parents stay with you, it\u2019s in our genes. I lost my dad as an adult and my younger brothers much younger, your parents will pop into your mind for a lifetime of milestones. And that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s how they stay with us, always present. You never need anyone\u2019s validation or approval of that. Ever.", "Oh, honey.\n\nNTA. Your cousins are young and can't even remotely begin to understand what you are going through. You have had to grow up faster than most. Don't be mad at your cousins - they genuinely don't know better. It's okay to tell them to stop saying how great it must be to live with your grandparents. It's okay to tell them how much pain you are in. If you do, try to put it in words that they might understand. \"It hurts so much I find it hard to breathe\" or \"I miss my dad so much it's like the whole world is now in black and white instead of color\" or something. But, no matter how you explain it, they won't understand until they lose someone close to them.\n\nYour aunts are AH here, but don't let it get to you. If they say it again, just tell them that you are very grateful for your grandparents. And if they really don't leave it, tell them you are very grateful for your grandparents so you don't have to live with them. Most importantly, your grandparents understood what you meant.\n\nAnd finally, I am so so sorry for your loss. Sometimes life is a bitch and unfortunately you had to find that out young. Wish I could hug you.", "Your Arsehole cousins keep drawing your attention to your altered circumstances. Which'll understandably make you constantly think about your parents. So no, NTA. I hope they finally shut the fuck up.", "Definitely NTA\nThere is something seriously wrong with your aunt\u2019s response. I seriously hope she realises how bizarre her response is. \nI do wonder if it\u2019s her grief (perhaps complete denial of the magnitude of the situation) to make her so thoughtless. Either way, no excuse for her response.", "No and it\u2019s disturbing these grown adults are beating you up over this. So common. It\u2019s obvious what you meant, his passing is still fresh. NTA", "Nta. Your aunt is. \nYou had a lot of things in your life that forced you to grow up. Your cousins didn't. They are more children. So i understand they only see the fun things. They need to have a talk about this. They are wrong ofcourse, but i don't blame them", "First of all OP, I'm very sorry for your loss(es)\n\nNTA\n\nYour cousins only see the \"fun\" side of living with your grandparents. Not to say your grandparents aren't loving, caring and fun. But, no one can really replace your parents (especially if you had a great relationship with them)\n\nI'm glad your grandparents understand where you're coming from. I can only imagine how hard it's been for you and the adjustments you've had to make.\n\nAs far as the rest of your family goes, fuck them.\n\nIf they can't see that you *are* grateful your grandparents are caring for you but you still have the valid right to be sad and upset about your dad, then their opinions and words don't matter.\n\n*Of course* you'd rather have your dad. There is NOTHING wrong with that.", "NTA They have no idea.", "I'm (59F) sure that your grandparents knew what you meant.  It was nice that you were able to spend a few days on a short vacation with your grandparents, but of **course** you'd rather have your parents still be alive!

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Lots of hugs.", "NTA what is wrong with your aunt??", "NTA. Its a thoughtless thing your cousins are saying, I assume just due to lack of perspective. Your reaction is understandable\u2026 your aunts\u2019 reactions, on the other hand, make your cousins\u2019 statements make a lot of sense.", "NTA, your aunt is, there are a lot of harsher words that are more fitting to describe her\n\nBoth you and your cousins are children, they're not seeing the bigger picture and not thinking of the other side of it, nothing wrong with what you did", "NTA it's quite possible your cousins are miserable at home, making them jealous, but you're not wrong for missing your parents.", "My sister is adopted and I hated it when she was having behavioural problems and people who knew would say \"she should be grateful.\" Having a home and a family isn't a luxury, it's an entitlement for children.", "Good point, if the aunts are still saying mean things to him, the grandparents should step in and say something to their daughters that they're being AH.", "My 4 baby cousins all under the age of 6, understand that they lost their grandma (also my grandma).", "Considering how much of a paragon of empathy that cousin is, I can't say I'm surprised that his mom is like this.", "Yeah, 15 is wayyyy to old to be telling a recently orphaned person they're lucky. In fact, 13 is pushing it too.", "Nta I'm glad you have grandparents that understand exactly what you mean! The adults in this situation should all understand that of course you want your parents! No one should make you feel bad about that!!", "Mt 7 year old would have more sense & kindness than to say these things.  Her friend lost her mum at childbirth & it's an unspoken rule amongst the gang that nobody mentions it unless she brings it up.", "Well it's easy to see why OP's cousin are as emotionally stunted as they are.

But she won't be very old when the situation flips from her mostly receiving their support to her providing them with hers more often than not, probably less than 30. \n\nJudging from her aunt's attitude, she might very well have to juggle being a parent to young kids and acting as her grandparents' primary support system in the future too.", ">IMO, sincerely telling her she is lucky would be a sign of impaired emotional intelligence in someone half their age.\n\nLike I said, I think 7 would be pushing it! I would honestly expect a 7yo to be sufficiently capable of putting themselves in somebody else's shoes to realize that even living the whole year like you're on vacation is not worth losing one loving parent, let alone two.\n\nI'd expect a 13 year old to also be able to put together that living with your grandparents full-time is *not* going to be like a constant vacation.", "They are 15 and 13, that's old enough to understand."]}
