I would say Alison and I have actually adjusted quite well, all things considered, and our relationship is fantastic. We are very close, and are a source of strength for each other. It has only been over the last year that I\u2019ve felt that things have got to a level of normalcy for us. \n\nMy wife\u2019s mother lives in the same town as us, and has been very helpful with things. I believe she views herself at times as a surrogate mother to Alison, stepping in to help from time to time. It has mainly been really good to have her in the picture, but over the last couple years, as my daughter has been in high school, my mother in law has started to overreach, in my view. \n\nShe has made the point that she thinks my daughter is clingy at times, calling me \u201cdaddy\u201d still, that kind of thing, and that it\u2019s \u201cborderline inappropriate.\u201dI have let her know that I appreciate her feedback, but prefer that she not be judgmental about our dynamic. She\u2019s also been open with me about her concerns about my daughter\u2019s posts on instagram, saying she is flaunting her body and there are too many bikini shots, etc. I have let her know that\u2019s an area I am fine with just letting Alison express herself however she would like, and that it\u2019s basically the trend for teens anyway. \n\nMy mother in law basically has said I need to adjust my parenting now that I have a 16 year old young woman in the house. I have (politely) let her know I will handle things how I see fit. \n\nAITA? I feel like she is intruding, but I also order if I have a blind spot on some of this stuff as a dad.\n\nETA: the advice and support I\u2019ve received here has been outstanding! I would love to hear advice on how to navigate dating (which I\u2019ve begun to do) in my situation, respecting my daughter.

If you have no concerns about your daughter\u2019s mental, emotional, or physical well being, then no one else should, either.\n\nIt may be time to tell grandma that she\u2019s welcome to love and support her granddaughter but her views on what is appropriate are not welcome and may result in less time around your daughter. That\u2019s a fair boundary to establish\u2026especially to your daughter.

Clinging to her remaining parent who she has a strong relationship with isn\u2019t unexpected or bad if she is independent and can function appropriately for her age. \n\nAs others have said, make sure you are talking to her regularly about internet safety and monitoring her online activity from anything that looks concerning to you. \n\nYour MIL has lost her daughter and it isn\u2019t shocking that she might be feeling extra protective of her grandchild because she\u2019s part of the daughter that she lost. So while it\u2019s frustrating and you are NTA for setting boundaries firmly and clearly, perhaps you can try to reassure her that you are keeping an eye on her online activity and share articles about teens and internet safety that align with your views and give her some actual things she should be on the lookout for. But again, set your boundaries and do not allow her to cross them. You seem like you are telling her respectfully. I get that it\u2019s frustrating and kind of insulting, I do think she is really just scared and wants to protect her granddaughter. I can\u2019t fault her for that.", "It is nobody's business but yours and Alison's if she calls you Daddy or whatever. It is not a universal law that at a certain age you need to stop saying Mommy and Daddy.\n\nAs far as the instagram goes, if those bikinis are appropriate to be worn to a public beach or pool, then it's *probably* appropriate to post on instagram. I'd recommend that Alison lock those posts, if only to keep MIL from having the vapors, but it's okay for a 16 year old to, well, have a body.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It's worth doing what you can to keep the relationship positive for your daughter and her grandmother but it's not appropriate for her grandmother to be trying to guide your parenting. I'd acknowledge her help and good intentions but gently remind her that you're doing ok and will continue to lean on her when you need to. Good luck!", "NTA but like others I do think you should make sure you\u2019ve addressed internet usage and what\u2019s appropriate/safe to post at any age (it\u2019s not like creeps stop creeping once she turns 18 you know?).  And there is a difference between a pic of a young woman being at the beach and she happens to be wearing a bikini and a certain type of posed picture in a bikini you know? Good to make sure that grandma is just overreacting to the former because the latter would be concerning to me for a 16 year old.\n\nThe rest of her complaints feel more like her thinking with a dirty mind. The implications of it aren\u2019t ok and I\u2019d not blame you if you were a little offended.", "NTA but why is MIL sexualizing your daughter????", "NAH.\n\nYou're parenting the best way you know how and it sounds like you have a great dynamic with your daughter. That's awesome considering your past trauma, I know that can be hard to get through but it sounds like you made yourselves a team to get through it together.\n\nMIL is probably a little more conservative (older generations are like that) and shocked by your daughter's internet behavior and your relationship dynamic. Guessing by your age, she's probably in her 60's? It might be hard for her to see your daughter posting stuff like bikini pictures because that is absolutely not in line with the \"modesty\" views that a lot of people in her generation follow. She might be overstepping in your eyes, but in her eyes, she is probably concerned and trying to share her concerns with you.\n\nIt sounds like you're handling it well though! Keep telling her your boundaries and asserting that you have the situation under control and are okay/comfortable with your daughter's posts and your dynamic. You are all working through a shared trauma together and your daughter is the last piece of her own daughter that she has.\n\nSomeone else mentioned internet safety, and I think that would be a good conversation to have with your daughter if you haven't had it yet. Have a talk with her to make she she's not posting anything like location or identifying features (her school, sports teams, her car or license plate if she drives, tagging locations, etc.), and make sure her account is set to private. I personally started dealing with stalkers around her age, so you want to make sure she's protected while still being able to express herself.", "NAH.\nGrandparents can have difficulty to adjust to grandchildren growing in a work so different from what we grew up in.\nEnglish is not my 1st language so the dad/daddy issue doesn\u2019t strike me as problematic. My almost 16yo daughter still call us the French equivalent of mummy and daddy, give us hugs, etc. We are very close and loving, but nothing creepy.\n\nConcerning Instagram, I\u2019m more concerned. If you daughter\u2019s account is private and you know the people following her, no real problem. Posing in a bikini on a public account is more dangerous. I have seen some of my daughter\u2019s acquaintances post \u2018suggestive\u2019 photos, with localisation or enough information to localise them and they can easily become targets. I don\u2019t know how much supervision of her social media you have but it\u2019s really worth having discussions with her (or do a little research and you\u2019ll find everything you never wanted to know about predators in social media).\n\nI think you should just be clear with MIL about the boundaries. That you respect her opinion, you will consider it and in the end make your own decision.\nYou seem like a great dad and you daughter is lucky to have you and her grandma", "No AH\"s here.  She is probably a little old schol, as am I, and is worried about not only her potentially risqu\u00e9 behavior, but also her safety.  It's great you let her be free with her social platform, but as her father it is your duty and responsibility to protect and guide her and its also possible your MIL is seeing things you aren't and from a different t perspective.  \"Daddy\" is a little odd, but I've heard it before and it's nothing off the wall creepy...as long as you aren't forcing her to call you that!  Haha...then it becomes creepy!  \n\nYour MIL means well and I'm sure you see that, and yes it can be frustrating to have someone else butt into your parenting since you've been doing it your way for the last five years.  Just let her know you understand how much she loves her grandchild and wants only the best...but that you just disagree in some forms.  I'm betting she is seeing her grand baby grow more into the daughter she lost and is hurting, too, and may just have that need to give input.", "NAH. Totally valid concerns on her part. And you are free to do with them as you wish.", "I'm seeing NAH.\n\nHer concerns are valid as is your decision to not let them lead your relationship with your daughter.
