Jesus, while I believe single moms have the right to have a social life, having a virtual stranger smoke up and fuck with a 3-y/o in the house is slightly creepy\n\nFull disclosure.. I am a female - older, who's 16 marriage ended suddenly. After a year or so, I started dating again and it was the first time I ever dated people who were actual parents.  I am a parent, but my kiddo was an adult when I started dating again.  It is honestly creepy what some parents will do. My partner and I have been together for a while. He didn't even let me meet his daughter until over a year of dating - she was 7 when we began.   I met her at 8 or 9.  I moved in when she was 12. She is 16 now.  We went slow. Her needs always came before mine and ours as a couple - and that's ok.  It hasn't always been easy, but I have no regrets.\n\nHad he invited me over to smoke and fuck when she was 7, would I have gone?!?  Probably,  but I would not have considered him as much more than a one night thing.  One-night things are fine, but honestly?!?!

They usually wait to do the tango when the kid is asleep because the kid has no boundaries (she is 2)", "I dunno, that\u2019s kind of generalized.\n\nI\u2019m a medical user and I\u2019m pretty regularly \u201cHigh on weed\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m also a good father of 2 young boys, and there\u2019s very little I can do with them without it that I can\u2019t do with it.  In fact, considering the chronic pain alleviation, I can do a lot more with them while using it.\n\nI don\u2019t see the weed as the issue here, I see the stranger, the casual sex with the kid home, and the flippant attitude about \u201cJust come smoke\u201d to be the problem. \n\nIf it was after the kid was asleep I wouldn\u2019t really see an issue though", "There you go. I'm a single mom, and my son hasn't met any of the dudes I've dated. Ever. Not until I know itbis serious. His dad, on the other hand? Every woman he dates hangs around the whole weekend he has our kid. Our son forms attachments to these women, and some of them has kids he befriends. Then they are gone and my son gets sad. It's fucking horrible.", "Yeah we were work friends but that\u2019s it, I never hung out with her outside of work and we only started texting this week. I would definitely be a stranger to her kid though", "Slut shaming.", "How many 'uncles' has this kid met getting up to pee or or a glass of water?", "I\u2019m not judging if people do that, I just don\u2019t wanna do that..", "Well, back in my day, we used to cook Cocaine and then smoke it. Called FreeBasing. Talk about paranoia. Ah, the good ole 1980\u2019s.", "She can smoke all she wants. I personally feel like inviting him over in the first place was already a bad call, but getting stoned with a stranger in your house while you have a young kid is not something I would ever do. \n\nOP dodged a bullet :).", "Well your kids can't get a contact high from a beer, and they don't inhale smoke. \n\nAlso when kids are that young, and awake, and you are the primary caretaker, you need to be very sober - like 1-2 drinks tops. If you can regulate your weed intake as easily as you can alcohol, that's one thing, but weed is far less regulated (ie, I know exactly how much alcohol I'm drinking with a beer) so it's riskier.", "Hello, I\u2019m a long-time weed smoker (over a decade) and smoking weed in front of your kids IS different than having a glass of wine or some beers. I personally think the stigma should exist for a reason. Weed shouldn\u2019t be around kids, period. It normalizes it way too much, and kids should not be smoking weed until they\u2019re much older, but they\u2019re gonna be smoking at like age 13 if it is normalized.", "Agree. As I said elsewhere.", "Absolutely agree.. OP NTA", "I don't disagree, except that it would probably be seen as less \"trashy\" if it was a glass of wine or two and OP was boyfriend and not fuckbuddy.\n\nLots of slut-shaming comments in this thread. Like I said, OP NTA.", "Don't married parents do this?", "Lol, you quit weed and became a junkie. That's low-key pretty funny.", "Yeah I\u2019m not judging her for smoking around her kid, I don\u2019t really involve myself in other peoples personal business. I just personally would not be comfortable smoking around kids of any kind, let alone one I have zero relationship with. \n\nIf im not chilling when im smoking, im not gonna have a good time", "As a medical user and father as well, I agree 100%. It's no different then being on prescription drugs around kids and I'd be willing to say at least 99% of the people having an issue with the weed around kids are on at least a handful of prescription drugs daily. I'd rather leave my kid with their high grandparents than any of the daycare teachers and there daily handful of mental health drugs.", "Not that they aren\u2019t allowed to smoke weed and have sex. But to expose your child to second hand smoke? As a parent you have a responsibility to your child\u2019s health. You can decide to smoke weed, but your child can\u2019t make that decision yet, nor should they be essentially hotboxed.", "I have a hard time agreeing with this. I don't think that there's anything wrong with Mom smoking or having sexual partners. I'm all for everyone having a good time, but you need to put the kids first and you need to set a good example for them. Or you end up with kids like me. Where they end up 28 and all the sudden there have different adult figures in their lives. They end up going to those adults because they're the ones that have displayed actual real life skills.\n\nYou have to teach children how to run their own lives. No one comes with those instructions. My parents did this kind of shit a lot, and all it did was show me how to not live my life. All it taught me to do was go to other adults in my life for real advice and to not trust my parents.", "Isn\u2019t that crack? \ud83e\udd23", "not really, you really shouldn\u2019t get drunk when you\u2019re solely responsible for a 3 year old either. the whole point of being responsible for a toddler is that you need to literally be responsible", "I\u2019m not married to this woman, and there really wasn\u2019t any courtship. It was supposed to be \u201csmoke and chill\u201d and it was pretty clear to both of us", "Yes, but their kid grows up knowing their parents fuck. OP's potential partner's kid will grow up knowing that on any random day, a strange man may show up to smoke pot and fuck their mom.\n\nAnd it may or may not be the only time the kid ever sees that dude.\n\nMom's allowed to fuck whom she wants, but it's a shitty thing to do her child, and it will likely have life-long ramifications.\n\nEdit to add the sentence about maybe the only time ...", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 yes they do or else Everyone would be an only child", "They didn't say they quit weed. They said they quit smoking around their child.", "Plus, apparently, none of these parents have ever left their kids  in the other room while they take a bathroom break, which somedays coincidently takes me 200% longer to do then take a hit off a piece.", "There's been no shortage of AITA stories involving parents with revolving door of partners. The comments are always filled with people with similar experiences talking about how traumatic it was because they always felt unsafe (or they actually were in unsafe situations) and how their parents prioritized themselves over their children.", "I was under the assumption that the child would be in their own room. I absolutely agree that they shouldn't be doing any of that with the child in the roo..", "Right, but to be fair, we don't actually know if she does this all the time or that she's a bad parent. Just that she had plans with this guy to smoke and have sex then was disappointed when those plans fell through. I just think society at large is way too hard on parents, especially moms, and that it's ok for them to let loose and have some fun. Provided it's within reason, which I'm assuming for your parents it wasn't \"within reason\" and that really sucks.", "Well, apparently it\u2019s similar? Learn something new every day. Thanks for the laughs! Funny guy.\n\n\u201cMany people use the term \u201cfreebase\u201d to refer to crack, the smokable form of cocaine. While both freebase and crack cocaine are a crystal substance that can be smoked in a pipe, they aren\u2019t made the same way.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.arkbh.com/blog/crack-vs-freebase/", "There's as much gray area between \"a glass of wine\" and \"drunk\" as there is between \"a few puffs off a joint\" and \"15 bong rips stoned.\"", "Coming from a former single mom. You did the right thing, OP. Especially if you're not comfortable.", "You would be surprised how much judgement I get in IRL for not wanting any new man around my son at any point. Unless he has a say in his whereabouts, I don\u2019t want men knowing where I live  or meeting my son. People give me shit about it, especially single mothers. Like I\u2019m robbing my son of something. Meanwhile, he is very happy about my decision to keep him out of my dating life. His father is very much alive.", "Someone who is smoking should be going outside, not just stay in a different room than kids.\n\n\n\nSmoke doesn't care what anyone wants. It doesn't listen to doorways, because there's sometimes also a crack at the top of the door or along the sides, so toweling the bottom of the door wouldn't work. Smoke loves travelling through the air because heat rises. If it happened to get near an air vent, the idea is also bunk.\n\n\n\n\nUnless the room is sealed air-tight and is completely aired out before opening the door, there is still a good chance that the smoke might get to the kid. Silly game to play with a developing brain, imo.\n\n\n\n\nFirst hand experience. I always knew. Attic, basement, two stories difference, I still knew.", "I'll agree with you that we don't know. We do however know that people, especially by the age that they're having children. Aren't super prone to change. This is probably happening frequently, and unless something does happen will probably continue into the future.\n\nAlso I would just like to point out that \" within reason \" probably includes having a babysitter. Saying don't worry about it they're in the other room, isn't really doing anything.", "Exactly. Personally I wouldn't do any of it, but also wouldn't fault someone for a puff or two or a beer or two.", "I think that's a reach. First of all, we know her age (26). And ask anybody in their 30s and 40s if they're the same person they were at 26. But I'm also not sure why that's relevant. Like, maybe you're right, and this happens all the time, but your assumption  is based on your own personal biases and not much else. \n\nAnd that second point we're just not gonna agree on. People have sex and smoke weed while their kids are in the other room all the time. And 26 y/o single mothers are not likely to be able to get a reliable and affordable babysitter. I think the expectation of getting a babysitter everytime is unreasonable. But I also think the OP isn't wrong for feeling uncomfortable with it.", "I appreciate the well thought out and meaningful discussion. I hope you truly have a nice day wherever you are.", "What? This man is sleazy for \n\n*checks notes*\n\nNOT wanting to have sex with a woman he doesn\u2019t know while her kid who he also doesn\u2019t know is home because the idea makes him uncomfortable? \n\nThat\u2019s sleazy?", "Same, you too", "For only wanting to see someone for sex and not hang out."]}
