I have no problem with casual sex or drug use, but with the kid there, it seems a little irresponsible. \n\nIt also depends on the age of the kid, but if it's young and there's an emergency and she's preoccupied and stoned, that's not good. \n\nIf it's an older kid and they come out of the room and see mom and some stranger smoking and bangin' in the living room, that's also not a good look. \n\nA rain check is called for her. :D", "NTA\n\nYour intuition is correct. It would be a bad move but honestly, if the mom is willing to do this with you then chances are you aren't the first. Caution with this lass.", "NTA.\n\n>She told me that her babysitter canceled, but she still wants me to come over to \"smoke and chill\"\n\nThis is very irresponsible. She wants to passionately hug and smoke while a 3 year old is present; yeah that's a nope for me", "NTA. If you weren't comfortable, you aren't comfortable.", "NTA \n\nShe sounds shady as a mom for finding getting high and having sex with strangers with her kid there acceptable! You made the right choice!", "NTA\n\nI would also feel pretty weird about it", "NTA- If you\u2019re not comfortable then you\u2019re not comfortable.  You aren\u2019t obligated to do something you\u2019re not comfortable with.  The fact that the mom is willing to do that with her kid around is irresponsible.  Dodged a bullet imo.", "NTA.     \nMom of the Year over there needs to get her priorities straight.", "NTA. If she's occupied with you, who's going to be watching her 3 year old? Nobody? That's not safe.", "NTA and very irresponsible of her. You did the right thing, shame on her.", "NTA - kids change everything", "NTA - it'd be a major libido killer for me, personally.", "NTA. She sounds messy. Just lose her number and keep going!", "NTA. You\u2019ve got to be really unaware to think , \u201chaving a 3yo child doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d Give me a fuckin break, there\u2019s no shame in being a single mom in her twenties, but it definitely does affect things like this", "NTA. Do not ignore the red flags.", "There probably never was a babysitter.\n\n She hooked you in, got you keen, and hoped you wouldn't change your mind when you found out.", "NTA, but if you're gonna date a woman with a three-year-old, you are gonna have to get used to hanging out with her and the kid eventually. Babysitters are expensive and cancel a lot. It sounds like it's too early in the relationship to be meeting her kids, but I also kind of feel for her because having young children can be an incredibly isolating experience.", "NTA. Not all judgement is bad; its called discernment. It is a bad idea to get high and hook up in front of a young child who needs constant supervision. She probably knows deep down its an irresponsible decision and she is projecting onto you.", "NTA at all, and this tells you a lot about her character. Bullet dodged", "Nta.   \n\nAnd run....\n\n\n  She let's strange men come to her house, to get in an altered state with a child present?  Not the type of girl you want in your life imo", "Reminds me when I caught my mom fucking a dude when I was not much older than her kid.\n\nIdeally you should be hosting her anyway, the kid deserves a safe space.", "NTA if you aren\u2019t comfortable with a situation you have every right to back out. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is and doesn\u2019t even mean you are judging the other person, you are just staying true to your own conscience.", "Nta", "Lol you made the right call, nta.   Geeze people, it's not like she invited him over for a dinner and watching the incredibles.   There were specific adult activities that he didn't want to do around the kid.  You absolutely made the right call.", "INFO:\n\nIs this like a first date? Or is this a relationship? Was this supposed to be a hookup? Or a casual evening chilling with a FWB sort of thing? Like what was the plan? What time in the evening would you have gotten there? Kids have bedtimes\u2026\n\nMore context would be helpful. Parents have lives too, and they work around having kids.", "NTA - find someone to fuck that is not okay with being under the influence of drugs with their kid around and a stranger.\n\nI smoke too, have for 15 years but ya ain\u2019t catching me doing that when I\u2019m the sole guardian for a 3 year old.

Based on your description, it sounds like this isn\u2019t a girlfriend/partner but more of hookup/casual situation.  I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable (and honorable) that you don\u2019t want to get high and have sex while her toddler is there.", "NTA. At all. That's not your kid. I would feel super uncomfortable smoking around a child, especially if it's not mine. Maybe, I'm a worry wart but I would be worried about something happening to the kid while I'm there (because I'm imagining that there wouldn't be much focus on the kid during said activities) and somehow being blamed.", "NTA. I like to smoke & chill but never around my child. She's TA.", "If you continue to see her then you will be the A H. You need to leave that ALL THE WAY alone. \nNTA", "NTA, that is a perfectly reasonable boundary.

If there's a sober adult there then it's not as bad, but yeah the mom here sounds too laid back.", "Kids go to sleep\u2026 how do you think 2 parents in one household get some?", "I\u2019m not judging her or anything, I know how it is. There was no talk at any point about dating or a potential relationship, this was gonna be a chill and see what happens kind of night.", "Yea but meeting a kid on the first date, especially when you\u2019re going over to smoke and be intimate is pretty inappropriate. Odd that the mom is encouraging it", "According to his other comments they\u2019ve known it other via work for a couple months, so \u201cstrange men\u201d is over the top. Still though, smoking when you\u2019re the primary caregiver to a 3-y-o is worrisome by itself.", "I agree, like I said in another comment, when I say babysitter I mean she was going to drop her kid off at a babysitter so we could have the house alone. \n\nI absolutely was not going to go over and have sex with her, while her kid was in the living room with a babysitter. That\u2019s not what was talked about at all.\n\nFunnily enough, your comment triggered some memories for me. I was raised by a single mom, and was always confused as a young lad as to why there were strange men around. I think I just cracked the code", "We met each other a few months ago, we worked at the same job. Earlier this week she DMed me, we got to talking about buttplugs and she said \u201cI might have one, come find out.\u201d She sent me her address and we made plans for Friday (today) and she said she would get a sitter.\n\nEdit: we were work friends and never talked about dating/hooking up while we worked together.", "I didn\u2019t outright say that on the phone. But from our texts its clear we both know what kind of night this was gonna be.", "Well, let me defend myself a little bit. I\u2019m not judging her at all, never once did I judge her. I told her I didn\u2019t want to smoke and fuck when her child was home. I\u2019m not married to her, I\u2019m not dating her, this is a hookup through and through. And I told her I wanted to reschedule\n\nEdit: my feelings are MY feelings. I said *I* feel sleazy, I didn\u2019t say anything about her. *I* am uncomfortable with being the random dude that shows up, says \u201cHey kiddo\u201d, smokes a blunt, and then proceed to have sex with her mom in the next room", "The fact this woman wants to invite a stranger over to do drugs and have casual sex when she has a 3 year old and thinks that doesn\u2019t affect anything is WILD. \n\nYour anecdotal evidence of fucking your wife is a non sequitur.", "Pretty sure if the babysitter has shown they would have left the house.", "That\u2019s one of my main concerns. Something happening to the kid. Even if her kid was asleep like some other commenter said, I would feel really really weird if her kid had a nightmare or needed help in the middle of the night. And I\u2019m just some dude in her moms bed", "See and I was thinking about this too.

If the kid's asleep in their room, it really doesn't matter, in my opinion.", "You made the right call. It\u2019s already pretty weird that she wants you to come over, without even having a proper date, while her kid is there and on top of that she also wants to get high.", "But based on your post you upset her, which suggests you cancelled in a way that shamed her, the A H is for how you made her feel in your execution. \n\nYou never said that you\u2019d be meeting the kid \u201cthe kid is in the other room\u201d.

Meaning her kid was not going to be at the house. \n\nI think I wasn\u2019t clear enough and you\u2019re misunderstanding me.

Must be very confusing.", "What\u2019s your reasoning?", "My reasoning is that you were expecting a single mum to go the extra mile. You just were just going to show up to get some. Ugh", "It\u2019s not like I told her \u201cGet a babysitter so I can fuck you.\u201d She\u2019s the one who asked me to come over, she\u2019s the one who said she would get a sitter.", "But when it wasnt that you didnt want to hang at all.
