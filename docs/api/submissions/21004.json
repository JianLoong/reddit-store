{"id": 21004, "submission_id": "14nbo0n", "title": "AITA for bringing my kids back inside when SIL sent her kid out to play?", "selftext": "29F. My husband and I live right next door to his sister (43f). We have 3 kids, she has 1. Now maybe I'm a bit of a helicopter mom but I refuse to send my kids outdoors to play without me. It's a big yard but it is fairly close to the main road and our youngest is only 6 and has ADHD/impulse control issues. Anyways, my SIL will send her kid outside for hours on end and never check on her. She just sits at her computer all day playing games. And now, where she knows I'm going to be outside with my kids, she just sends her kid out constantly expecting me to keep an eye on her. I've told my husband several times I'm getting a bit fed up with being a watchful eye to anyone but our kids and he said he would speak to his sister- which he did. Her response was \"I don't see the big deal where she's outside anyways and it's not like she needs constant supervision\". So in the end, nothing changed. \n\nWell, yesterday she sends her kid out and I decided to just leave. I brought my kids to the beach because I didn't want to watch another kid. Today, same thing but it was overcast so I just brought my kids indoors and we played board games. Well, my SIL just knocked on my door and said \"why did you bring the kids in? I just had Hannah get dressed to play with the kids\". So I reiterated that I'm not being paid to babysit and therefore I'm not going to be watching her kid every time my kids are outdoors. She then says \"so you are punishing the kids and not allowing them to play together?\" And proceeded to call me childish. I simply shut the door. \n\nHowever, now I'm wondering if I'm really the AH here. I wouldn't mind if it was every once in a while but it's nearly every single day this happens and I'm tired of assuming a parenting role for this kid.\n\nETA: my kids are 6, 10, 12. Hers is 9. Part of the reason I don't want to watch her is because she allows her daughter to play in the street or ride bikes in the street and it gets my kids pissed off because I don't allow it (again, it's fairly close to the main road). My 12yo is not a parent and therefore will not be forced to keep an eye on his siblings or another child. I refuse to parentify my child like I was at his age. My youngest has asthma and I need to be on standby with his inhaler. SIL never watches my kids, even when I've asked in the past because she \"can't handle that many kids\" or \"can hardly handle her own\". This is a one sided arrangement where I do all the parenting for her because she refuses to do anything with her kid.", "created_utc": 1688158062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbo0n/aita_for_bringing_my_kids_back_inside_when_sil/", "score": 2523, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Every time.  And she needs to reciprocate, either by watching your children, or by some other favor, taking work off of your plate.  E.g., if you're watching the kids, and she's preparing dinner, she prepares enough for both households, and sends some over to your house, so you don't have to cook that day.  \n\nHow long are you planning to be outside?  Do you have to leave at a certain point in time?  Do you have a specific activity planned, such as inviting their school friends over, where your niece would not fit in? Are your children in good health?  Is her child?  Has her child had breakfast/lunch, have yours, is she assuming you'll feed her child?  Will she be home so that you can send her daughter back when you're done having the kids play outside, or is she taking off somewhere?  \n\nI wouldn't make this about not being paid to babysit.  I'd make this about two adults communicating about a favor one is asking for, versus just assuming the favor will be done.   The problem isn't that she doesn't pay you, the problem is that she neither communicates nor reciprocates when she wants you to do her the favor of watching her child.", "NTA\n\nI once had a neighbor who would send her kid outside any time I was in my yard. I don\u2019t have kids. She was a cute kid, but I grew to resent the parents because I could not step foot into my backyard without that child being right there. \n\nFor the OP, one way to deal with this is to offer rotating play dates for the kids. OP watches them, say, from 1-3 on Monday afternoon and SIL watches them from 1-3 on Wednesday afternoon. \n\nThe kids get to play together, and both moms get a break.\n\nBe interesting to see if SIL is willing to watch all four kids.", "NTA.

Your 12 yr old could easily keep an eye on the 6 year old. When you say helicopter parent, I totally agree, it's a little over-bearing. All you need to do is look out every 10 mins or so and make sure all is well.\n\n\\#2 I don't see what the problem is, really. If you're going to be outside anyway, why can't your niece come over and play? Of course, she wants to play with her cousins. It's not really babysitting if you're literally just sitting on the porch and making sure no one kills themselves. If she wants to play in the street, you say no, those are the rules.\n\n\\#3 In the grand scheme of things, all you're actually accomplishing is keeping the kids apart and keeping them from having fun together.", "NTA.

If neither one of you wants to watch Hannah, your eldest is 12. Sign them up for babysitting lessons and they can be paid by the SUL to watch Hannah.", "ESH - I'm going to take the unpopular opinion here and say ESH. The SIL is an AH for expecting OP to watch her kid (but to be honest, I don't think the SIL expects that at all. I think SIL fails to watch her kid regardless of whether OP is there or not, which still makes SIL an AH). OP is an AH, because her actions aren't directed at SIL at all, because SIL could really care less if her daughter is being watched.  OP's actions are actually focused directly at SIL's daughter, who is the ONLY one being affected by OP's actions. OP's actions aren't forcing SIL to watch her kid, but it IS telling the 6 year old, \"I don't want my kids to play with or even associate with you. I don't like you\". \n\nThink about it. What if you were a 6 year old child who just came out to play with your cousins, and your aunt takes one look at you and immediately calls them in. How do you think you'd feel? OP really needs to find a better way to deal with SIL, because she's not the one being hurt here.", "NTA but you don\u2019t have to strain the relationship between your kids and their cousin. You absolutely don\u2019t have to supervise your niece but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t play with your kids. \nSil is ok with having her kid out unsupervised so you don\u2019t have to worry about her kid when shes outside. \nIf they are all playing together outside you don\u2019t have to \u201cbabysit\u201d her kid. Just focus on your kids and their safety. The other kid doesn\u2019t have to add extra supervision if you were never told to watch them in the fist place. Just watch your kids and let your niece do what she pleases.", "Kinda torn between ESH and AH. As I see, the kids are 12, 9, and 6. The older aged kids are most definitely old enough to occupy themselves without you hovering. \nHow do your kids feel about spending time with their cousin? If you are pulling them in just because you don\u2019t want to spend time watching another kid (who by all accounts is used to unsupervised play), you aren\u2019t really being fair.\nAt their ages, they really should be allowed time to spread their wings while not being constantly watched by the parents. \nTry communicating directly with SIL and kids, and definitely loosening the apron strings.", "ESH. \n\nBecause whether or not it's the question you are in fact the AH for not allowing your almost teenage child to play outdoors on his own. Even your preteen is quite capable of being outdoors on his own. And all four kids are capable of playing together without constant adult supervision. Since you insist on being outside, it makes sense that your niece would come and play with your kids. She can't play with them without you that leads to your SIL being correct, you don't want the kids to play together. Plus your judgement of her reasonable action of parenting her own kid and not feeling the need for constant supervision. \n\nOn your SIL's part, she shouldn't have pushed the issue. She should have accepted the no and moved on. She should move to have her child make other friends.", "Nta. And your comment about not parentifying your older kid is a huge bonus point for me. I was like the second mom in my house. The oldest sibling who my mom got to do everything. She had me young and by the time my siblings came along she was older and didn\u2019t want to run about after them so I was stuck doing it. Your right to take such good care of your own kids and not let her leech off you.", "YTA for believing that you should be watching the 9yo and taking your 10 and 12 year old kids away because you don't want to supervise.\n\nStop directly supervising all the older kids and let them play. Supervise your 6yo, let the others play together outside without your 6yo when you don't want to supervise.\n\nI N F O: if your youngest is 6, what are the ages of the other kids?", "YTA \n\nAnd projecting. \n\nYour 12 and 10 do not really need supervision and neither does your niece. You were \u201cparentified\u201d and I feel as though your meltdowns are more about not feeling forced or expected to watch a child you didn\u2019t birth. I knew something was off til your edit, then I saw it. You are already outside, i really don\u2019t see the issue. If the issue was that she is allowed to play in the road/ does play in the road, you would\u2019ve had that conversation if you really wanted the problem solved. \n\nYou are also an AH for how you spoke to some of the commenters asking you questions when you came here for judgement. People like you should be banned from posting, you came here, we didn\u2019t seek you out.", "NTA. If SIL is never willing to watch your kids, then you certainly don't owe it to her to watch hers.", "ESH. I get what you are saying. You really shouldn't have to watch her kid. But at the end of the day you are really just punishing your niece and your own kids. They are basically not being allowed to play with each other. A 9 year old really isn't a lot added if you are out there anyways. Even so, she shouldn't be your responsibility. I think the bigger issue is that you SIL parenting annoys you. I'm sure you are much more sensitive to shitty parents given your childhood. You probably hates that she gets away with being a neglectful parent. You doing these things will not make SIL a better parent. She will always be a shitty parent. Playing with her cousins is probably one of your niece's very few sources of happiness since she has a neglectful parent. There has to be a better solution though. For example, maybe setting specific days your niece is allowed to come over and/or the SIL has to agree that she will no longer let her daughter do the things you don't allow your kids to do.", "I'm leaning towards ESH here.\n\nIf you're already outside and the cousin is playing with your kids I don't see why it's such a big deal to watch your niece/nephew. \n\nI only say this because you actually are in potential of putting a strain on the relationship between your kids and their cousin. I grew up constantly around my cousins and all 5 of us look at each other like siblings, we literally all hangout together constantly, so maybe I'm biased and worried you're potentially robbing them of that sort of relationship. \n\nYes your SIL is a bigger AH for assuming you're okay just watching her kid, but if you're watching your kids play outside, I think it's kind of bizarre to sort of encourage an environment where you're not okay watching any one else's kids play with your kids. If it was a random group of kids strolling outside and they wanted to play with your kids, would you shoo them away as well? It's not like you can't tell your niece/nephew to go home when you guys go back inside.\n\nIf your niece/nephew is a total brat and handful to deal with, then my opinion changes to NTA, but otherwise, ESH", "ESH (SIL sucks much more) - I understand that your youngest has some issues, but you do sound like a helicopter mom. Kids that age are able to play outside together with so long as they follow the rules (physical boundaries of the yard, sticking together). \n\nIs the issue that the daughter doesn\u2019t play safely like you describe in the update? Or is this issue that you want to watch the kids and you want to demand that SIL watch them too. \n\nI think the aspect of the other kid playing in the street is a big issue. And it\u2019s a liability for you. So, that\u2019s super valid. But you seem mad that SIL doesn\u2019t helicopter parent like you do. A young kid is the one who is really being punished and I find that really sad.", "None of those kids need constant supervision. You\u2019re setting them up for future failure. YTA.", "**YTA**\n\nIt doesn't sound like your SIL needs you to watch her kid or is evening asking you to watch her kid. Your children might need to be supervised at all times, but not every kid needs that level of attention. You said yourself that she lets her daughter play outside by herself all the time. It's also pretty reasonable to believe that she is encouraging her daughter to go play with other children, not be watched by you. Other children who are her cousins/family. \n\nThis feels more like you're judging her and it comes at the cost of alienating your niece. Because if she comes out and you call your kids in and avoid her, you're making her feel terrible. That *kid* is your kids' family.", "Is it really a big deal if hannah comes out to play with ur kids? I rly dont get the annoyance here. Why cant ya just get along", "ESH is my default on in-law drama", "YTA.  She's not expecting you to babysit her kid, because her kid is 9 and can play without adult supervision.  If your kids are pissed off that her parents are less strict, so what?  That's part of life.  Don't keep the kids apart just because you're bitter your SIL is more laissez-faire than you.", "No verdict. No, actually YTA \n\nfor not allowing your kids to play outside just because another kid is out, and ONLY because the kids parent isnt  ALSO out with them. It seems there was literally no other reason.\n\nGenerally i would say helicopter parents are AHs - to their kids and their futute ability to think for themselves. This is more a parenting question than it is a AITA question. SIL is doing it the european way, it seems you do the american way. \n(when i was 6, from some point on i walked to kindergarten alone/w other kids, about 500-700m, crossing at least one \"major\" road)\n\nYou are exhausting yourself watching your kids, and your SIL trusts her daughter enough that she wouldnt need supervision 24/7. Obviously you were bound to clash if you try to enforce your views on each other.", "NTA - she should at least be paying you.", "NAH. I mean, you don\u2019t have to watch your niece so she can play with her cousins. It\u2019s weird of you though. It\u2019s also weird how judgmental you are of SIL. The playing game comment?

If OP feels the need to constantly be on the ready with the inhaler, again having the cousin there doesn\u2019t change anything.\n\nETA: OP, YTA for denying your kids and niece the opportunity to play together and develop a strong family bond of shared childhood experiences.

OP is literally just sitting outside watching her children like she would already be doing, and the niece just is playing along with them.

You have said that she leaves her kid out for long amounts of time, and doesn't check up on her , which is very irresponsible. Secondly , she doesn't check with you regarding the play dates which she seems to decide should be \"spontaneous\" . I can guarantee you even though she says that you needn't supervise her kid, if you turned your back away and God forbid something were to happen to that child, you would 100% be blamed for letting that happen.

But they apparently can\u2019t play in the yard unsupervised", "YTA \n\nI grew up with all my cousins, 21, including my sister and I, across 6 families. We all grew up in the same neighborhood. One of my aunt's lived across the street from me. Everyone was pretty much in walking distance. I grew up at all of my cousins' home. I have a core memory at every single one. And I have a few thoughts about this post. \n\n1. First thing first, you and your SIL need to have more of a schedule or an agreement on play dates and supervision if you insist on watching over your kids in your own yard. If your SIL doesn't agree on taking turns but also don't want to isolate your own niece from her cousins, you can offer certain days you can handle watching her. But as you stated, her mom trust her 9 year to play outside in yalls yards then you shouldn't have to feel to helicopter her too. Your kids know your rules, they must obey your rules. My family made it a point that regardless if the aunts and uncles were fighting, that shouldn't effect the relationship of us cousins. And it didn't. \n\n2. Have your 12 year old watch over your 6 year old. It's not parentifying your 12 year old. Growing up, this is how we were all able to hangout. We pretty much broke it up into groups, the big kids, the little kids. The older ones would keep an eye out on the smaller ones. And everyone else in the middle watches out for each other. But everyone watching everyone pretty much. This taught us a lot of responsibility and togetherness/community. But we never \"parent\" each other. I don't remember being a parent to any of my cousins. I don't think anyone feels that way. If anything bad happened we just ran to grab an adult. Like someone breaking a finger. Someone fell down. Literally any child related incidents we always grabbed an adult. And yes, we have 2 cousins who do have asthma. We were taught the importance and what to do incase of emergencies. And always remember to ask about their inhaler. \n\nBc of this, my cousins and I all are close to this day. We range from 35 to 11 in age and still see and speak to each other regularly.", "Esh. 12 & 9?!?! Your oldest is abt to be a teen, he deserves a little trust & privacy. Even 9. In your own yard at least. I get that you are sick of her taking advantage of you/not even asking, but don't punish the kids to make your point.", "YTA. SIL clearly trusts her daughter to be outside in the neighbourhood unsupervised. You're the one who thinks you need to supervise her. You don't. You don't even need to supervise your own kids out in your front yard, honestly.\n\nAt 12 years old, your eldest would probably rather be left in charge than have his mom hovering over him. It isn't \"parentifying\" to ask him to make sure his 6yo sibling doesnt run into traffic while you go make dinner. He can still come gets you if he needs to. It would be parentifying if he came to get you because he needed your help with something and you told him to deal with it himself. But keeping an eye on the younger siblings is a no-brainer for a 12yo.\n\nRegardless, all you're accomplishing is alienating your niece. Don't think for a minute that she hasn't noticed what you've been doing. I remember when I was a kid I went to a summer camp with my cousins when I was 10, and instead of picking me up my mom would just have me go to my cousins' house afterwards since it was walking distance from camp. My uncle was noticeably annoyed by this. Even though I knew even at the time that most of his anger was towards my mom, it still made me feel awful because I felt unwanted by family and like I was just an inconvenience.\n\nIf your SIL expects her daughter to be able to be safe outside by herself, then you can too. You don't need to do any extra supervision. Keep watching your own kids if you really want to. But don't vacate the premises as soon as their cousin shows up. That's straight up bullying by means of exclusion. You're bullying a nine year old", "YTa because ALL helicopter Moms are assholes. \"Near\" a main road? letting her kid \"riding a bike\" in the *gasp* street?

Heck, my sister who was 11 and I was 5, totally watched me and was given light responsibility. This was normal. \n\nYTA for taking away the kids' play time together because you're upset with your SIL instead of talking to her about it. SIL would be an AH for always saying no to watching your kids when you ask (if that is truly the case.)\n\nBut I really don't think she was expecting you to babysit her 9 year old.

And what 12/10 wants to play with a 6 year old all the time? Did you want to play with a 1st grader when you were in in 5th grade let alone middle school? You need to loosen the restraints. You are parentifying them by making them play with a 6year old all the time. I don't think a 6 year old is a \"problem child\" But they are at different ages and should have slightly different rules. You are being unfair. And I find you watching the 9 year old self afflicting work that you did to yourself. Simply don't watch her. I don't get how you are shock about cousins playing with each other all the time. Of course the 9 year old would go outside when their cousins are outside. You need to learn to trust your kids maam. If you can't then that is your fault for not teaching them street safety. And if you think it's unfair for your 6 year old find that 6 year old some friends or something.", "Mom's gonna go back to school too. Then she'll go to the job interviews. A mother's job really isn't done until she has visual confirmation the marriage has been consummated.", "I used to ride my bike all over town when I was 7", ">but not keep an eye out for a 4th (who is her niece)\n\nThe issue I think is that if something were to happen to the niece it would be OP's responsibility.", "Do you know what a 6yo adhd kid can do in 2 minutes, let alone 10? Yeah it\u2019s parentifying the kid to have to be responsible for the safety and well-being of a younger kid every time they go outside. Can the 12 year old not just enjoy themselves as the kid they are without worrying about what the 6 year old is getting into? Mom can sit outside and read a book and keep an eye on the ADHD kid with impulse control issues *herself* every minute.", "I mean some of the antics the other kids displayed was now what I realize, THAT kind of abuse", "The sister\u2019s kid doesn\u2019t need to be watched! Neither do two of OP\u2019s kids, unless OP has done such a shitty job raising them that a nine year old can\u2019t play in the yard (with a twelve year old present, no less) without mommy watching them like a hawk. Where the hell do they live, a broken glass factory on the precipice of an active volcano?", "That is bizarre.  My 10yo has free run all the way to the next farm, and can go see our neighbors alone, as long as she tells me first, and walks through the field not on the road.", "that made me so sad. Honestly, I'd just have the kid around as much as possible, it's a great chance to just love a kid, and they always need love. Esp when it's family! I imagine she'd be hurt and confused. Poor kid.", "The niece has autism (OP said in a comment). That probably requires more then benign neglect on the part of the OP. What if something did happen to the niece while the OP was out there, but was giving \"literally zero effort\"? You don't think she'd get nailed by the SIL saying she was out there, she should have been watching?\n\nCome on now...  \n\n\nETA:  Another poster nicely summed up the comments OP has made\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbo0n/comment/jq7sinv/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbo0n/comment/jq7sinv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\"Nofreetime991\r  \n\r  \nReading through OPs comments her niece is actively causing issues for OP when the niece comes out to play.\r  \n\r  \nNiece wants to play in the road because she is allowed to and won't even move for oncoming vehicles. OP is the one having to deal with this.\r  \n\r  \nShe is encouraging the 10 year old and 6 year old to do the same and when OP says no, her children become disgruntled with her.\r  \n\r  \nI read through everyone of OPs comments I could find. She was in no way an Asshole for how she replied.\r  \n\r  \nAnd exactly what conversation would have fixed her niece playing in the road since neither her SIL nor niece care when OP has repeatedly brought up the topic with them?\"", "Or that she trust her 9 yr old knows to play properly in the street.  My kid been playing in the street with friends since 7.  Did you only play in a yard or did you ride your bike in the road and play ball", "How was that not okay? I didn\u2019t really go on my own until I was a teen", "If I saw kids riding bikes in the street around here, I would call the sheriff; traffic is crazy and just a few months ago a kid got killed on an ATV.  I admire OP for caring enough to protect her children.", "I don\u2019t know. She doesn\u2019t let her 12 year old ride a bike on the street because it\u2019s too close to a main road and clearly thinks letting a 9 year old outside without constant supervision isn\u2019t good parenting. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to know without being in her neighbourhood but that seems like helicopter parenting to me.", "Granted the 6yo could already know how to do it. But if they don\u2019t then yeah op does need to work on that, as that can just set the kid up for failure in the long run.", "Dude I don't think anybody under like fifth grade should be playing outside unsupervised. \n\nLet alone an 8 year old.\n\nLike people can come snatch you or get hit by a car, or most commonly in my area, get attacked by a wild roaming dog", "I think the disdain is for the SIL refusing to do her job or reciprocate at all.", ">Hannah's 9. I won't even get into the \"back in my day\n\nYou won't. But I will. I'm 29. I was out in the backyard all day by myself when I was 5. I was biking around the block by myself at 6.\n\nOP is a helicopter parent personafide.", "I live in Germany, but here kids make their own way to school by age 6, cycle there by age 8 or 9. She is definitely helicoptering.", "In general, I'd agree. However, OP states 2 things that make me disagree in this case.\n\n1) The niece is allowed to do things that OP's children aren't, mainly playing in the road. If SIL doesn't make her daughter follow OP's rules or directions when OP is watching them, OP shouldn't be in charge of watching them.\n\n2) The niece has ASD. We don't know how this affects the niece in regards to her behavior, interpersonal skills, emotional regulation, or triggers. We also don't know if OP is comfortable with or equipped to handle the unique challenges that may come with it.", "Like the parentification OP is projecting on letting a 12 year old play unsupervised?  Have you read the replies? There\u2019s no need for any projection tbh.", "But if she's sending the kid over expecting her to play with her cousins, she has to accept that the cousins will have rules that will limit how she wants to play. She's not being taught that, and it's causing problems.", "I mean.... here's the thing.  When kids are at my house or I take kids to the park. Doesn't matter if it's my kids, my sisters kids, some neighbor kids... I'm in charge. When I was a kid, zero adults in the neighborhood would have hesitated to yell at a group of kids to stop doing something stupid, like play in the street and if some kids parent did get upset that I yelled at their kid I'd be like, well, you weren't there to parent so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nBut no adult has ever confronted me. They're more than happy to have their kids come to my house or the park. \n\nWhere I live, it's not rich people.  These kids, some of them have huge holes in the soles of their shoes, talking about \"the electricity is shut off\", whatever.  \n\nThey have problems. Mental, emotional. I don't know all their diagnosis and I don't know how to... do what some hired specialist would but I *do* know how to make boundaries, hold them, and reward good behavior.  Really... what more can you do. Just treat them all the same. Talk to then like they're a person. Listen.  \n\nIts not really... rocket science.", "I have read the replies. Op states very plainly that the 12yo is allowed to play unsupervised. What she does say about parentification is that she doesn\u2019t want the 12yo to constantly have to look after the 6yo. So yeah you need to work on your reading comprehension a bit.", "I read that the rule that was causing problems was her being allowed to ride her bike in the street.....I would say she doesn't have to follow that rule because it is not on ops property. However, If it has a hard line that she will not be allowed to play with her kids unless she doesn't go in the street to ride her bike then it is up to OP to draw that boundary and enforce/teach not SIL. If it was me though I would simply tell my kids u can't play there because I am in charge of you not your cousin. I do it all the time and 95% of the time they listen. The other 5% are teachable moments. I don't try to parent other people's kids when they are not guests in my home.\n\n Honestly op sounds like my neighbor. I no longer let my kid play with hers. When her son would come into my yard and so would she, barking orders at all the kids and telling them they were not allowed to do things because her son was not allowed to. She even asked a boy to leave my yard because he was \"too big to play with her son and would hurt him.\" She yelled at me for not watching her son close enough because I was inside doing dishes while they played outside. It. Was. Exhausting. but at the end of the day we were just fundamentally different parents and expected different things.", "I know, my partner\u2019s youngest has it. He has social issues and doesn\u2019t show much emotion, other than that he\u2019s like every other 14 year old. But we don\u2019t know how it affects the niece so it\u2019s hard to judge how similar to a neurotypical 9 year old she is. \n\nOP sounds a bit paranoid but things do happen. My brother was almost kidnapped twice out of our front yard at 3 and my ex boyfriend was almost snatched off his bike when he was 12. A van pulled up, opened up the slide and tried to pull him in. He was also hit by a car 3 times as a child, once in a cross walk. Things happen and it sounds like she\u2019s putting a lot of responsibility for the niece on herself.", "\u2018I'm not going to bring in my \"problem child\" so he feels left out, just so another kid can come play. What kind of bullshit is that? Lmfao \"yeah I need to make sure to keep MY kid indoors so another kid I didn't parent can have fun\".\u2019 \nSo she won\u2019t let the 12 year old go play without the 6 year old so the 6 year old doesn\u2019t feel left out , and calls her niece another kid she didn\u2019t parent."]}
