{"id": 21004, "submission_id": "14nbo0n", "title": "AITA for bringing my kids back inside when SIL sent her kid out to play?", "selftext": "29F. My husband and I live right next door to his sister (43f). We have 3 kids, she has 1. Now maybe I'm a bit of a helicopter mom but I refuse to send my kids outdoors to play without me. It's a big yard but it is fairly close to the main road and our youngest is only 6 and has ADHD/impulse control issues. Anyways, my SIL will send her kid outside for hours on end and never check on her. She just sits at her computer all day playing games. And now, where she knows I'm going to be outside with my kids, she just sends her kid out constantly expecting me to keep an eye on her. I've told my husband several times I'm getting a bit fed up with being a watchful eye to anyone but our kids and he said he would speak to his sister- which he did. Her response was \"I don't see the big deal where she's outside anyways and it's not like she needs constant supervision\". So in the end, nothing changed. \n\nWell, yesterday she sends her kid out and I decided to just leave. I brought my kids to the beach because I didn't want to watch another kid. Today, same thing but it was overcast so I just brought my kids indoors and we played board games. Well, my SIL just knocked on my door and said \"why did you bring the kids in? I just had Hannah get dressed to play with the kids\". So I reiterated that I'm not being paid to babysit and therefore I'm not going to be watching her kid every time my kids are outdoors. She then says \"so you are punishing the kids and not allowing them to play together?\" And proceeded to call me childish. I simply shut the door. \n\nHowever, now I'm wondering if I'm really the AH here. I wouldn't mind if it was every once in a while but it's nearly every single day this happens and I'm tired of assuming a parenting role for this kid.\n\nETA: my kids are 6, 10, 12. Hers is 9. Part of the reason I don't want to watch her is because she allows her daughter to play in the street or ride bikes in the street and it gets my kids pissed off because I don't allow it (again, it's fairly close to the main road). My 12yo is not a parent and therefore will not be forced to keep an eye on his siblings or another child. I refuse to parentify my child like I was at his age. My youngest has asthma and I need to be on standby with his inhaler. SIL never watches my kids, even when I've asked in the past because she \"can't handle that many kids\" or \"can hardly handle her own\". This is a one sided arrangement where I do all the parenting for her because she refuses to do anything with her kid.", "created_utc": 1688158062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbo0n/aita_for_bringing_my_kids_back_inside_when_sil/", "score": 524, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Every time.  And she needs to reciprocate, either by watching your children, or by some other favor, taking work off of your plate.  E.g., if you're watching the kids, and she's preparing dinner, she prepares enough for both households, and sends some over to your house, so you don't have to cook that day.  \n\nHow long are you planning to be outside?  Do you have to leave at a certain point in time?  Do you have a specific activity planned, such as inviting their school friends over, where your niece would not fit in? Are your children in good health?  Is her child?  Has her child had breakfast/lunch, have yours, is she assuming you'll feed her child?  Will she be home so that you can send her daughter back when you're done having the kids play outside, or is she taking off somewhere?  \n\nI wouldn't make this about not being paid to babysit.  I'd make this about two adults communicating about a favor one is asking for, versus just assuming the favor will be done.   The problem isn't that she doesn't pay you, the problem is that she neither communicates nor reciprocates when she wants you to do her the favor of watching her child.", "NTA\n\nI once had a neighbor who would send her kid outside any time I was in my yard. I don\u2019t have kids. She was a cute kid, but I grew to resent the parents because I could not step foot into my backyard without that child being right there. \n\nFor the OP, one way to deal with this is to offer rotating play dates for the kids. OP watches them, say, from 1-3 on Monday afternoon and SIL watches them from 1-3 on Wednesday afternoon. \n\nThe kids get to play together, and both moms get a break.\n\nBe interesting to see if SIL is willing to watch all four kids.", "NTA.

Now I know why my WOW guildmaster has been unavailable the last couple of days! \n\nJust kidding, you are NTA of course. You hit it on the head, she is using you and your kids as unpaid babysitters.

Your 12 yr old could easily keep an eye on the 6 year old. When you say helicopter parent, I totally agree, it's a little over-bearing. All you need to do is look out every 10 mins or so and make sure all is well.\n\n\\#2 I don't see what the problem is, really. If you're going to be outside anyway, why can't your niece come over and play? Of course, she wants to play with her cousins. It's not really babysitting if you're literally just sitting on the porch and making sure no one kills themselves. If she wants to play in the street, you say no, those are the rules.\n\n\\#3 In the grand scheme of things, all you're actually accomplishing is keeping the kids apart and keeping them from having fun together.", "NTA.

If neither one of you wants to watch Hannah, your eldest is 12. Sign them up for babysitting lessons and they can be paid by the SUL to watch Hannah.", "ESH - I'm going to take the unpopular opinion here and say ESH. The SIL is an AH for expecting OP to watch her kid (but to be honest, I don't think the SIL expects that at all. I think SIL fails to watch her kid regardless of whether OP is there or not, which still makes SIL an AH). OP is an AH, because her actions aren't directed at SIL at all, because SIL could really care less if her daughter is being watched.  OP's actions are actually focused directly at SIL's daughter, who is the ONLY one being affected by OP's actions. OP's actions aren't forcing SIL to watch her kid, but it IS telling the 6 year old, \"I don't want my kids to play with or even associate with you. I don't like you\". \n\nThink about it. What if you were a 6 year old child who just came out to play with your cousins, and your aunt takes one look at you and immediately calls them in. How do you think you'd feel? OP really needs to find a better way to deal with SIL, because she's not the one being hurt here.", "NTA but you don\u2019t have to strain the relationship between your kids and their cousin. You absolutely don\u2019t have to supervise your niece but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t play with your kids. \nSil is ok with having her kid out unsupervised so you don\u2019t have to worry about her kid when shes outside. \nIf they are all playing together outside you don\u2019t have to \u201cbabysit\u201d her kid. Just focus on your kids and their safety. The other kid doesn\u2019t have to add extra supervision if you were never told to watch them in the fist place. Just watch your kids and let your niece do what she pleases.", "Kinda torn between ESH and AH. As I see, the kids are 12, 9, and 6. The older aged kids are most definitely old enough to occupy themselves without you hovering. \nHow do your kids feel about spending time with their cousin? If you are pulling them in just because you don\u2019t want to spend time watching another kid (who by all accounts is used to unsupervised play), you aren\u2019t really being fair.\nAt their ages, they really should be allowed time to spread their wings while not being constantly watched by the parents. \nTry communicating directly with SIL and kids, and definitely loosening the apron strings.", "ESH. \n\nBecause whether or not it's the question you are in fact the AH for not allowing your almost teenage child to play outdoors on his own. Even your preteen is quite capable of being outdoors on his own. And all four kids are capable of playing together without constant adult supervision. Since you insist on being outside, it makes sense that your niece would come and play with your kids. She can't play with them without you that leads to your SIL being correct, you don't want the kids to play together. Plus your judgement of her reasonable action of parenting her own kid and not feeling the need for constant supervision. \n\nOn your SIL's part, she shouldn't have pushed the issue. She should have accepted the no and moved on. She should move to have her child make other friends.", "Nta. And your comment about not parentifying your older kid is a huge bonus point for me. I was like the second mom in my house. The oldest sibling who my mom got to do everything. She had me young and by the time my siblings came along she was older and didn\u2019t want to run about after them so I was stuck doing it. Your right to take such good care of your own kids and not let her leech off you.", "YTA for believing that you should be watching the 9yo and taking your 10 and 12 year old kids away because you don't want to supervise.\n\nStop directly supervising all the older kids and let them play. Supervise your 6yo, let the others play together outside without your 6yo when you don't want to supervise.\n\nI N F O: if your youngest is 6, what are the ages of the other kids?", "YTA \n\nAnd projecting. \n\nYour 12 and 10 do not really need supervision and neither does your niece. You were \u201cparentified\u201d and I feel as though your meltdowns are more about not feeling forced or expected to watch a child you didn\u2019t birth. I knew something was off til your edit, then I saw it. You are already outside, i really don\u2019t see the issue. If the issue was that she is allowed to play in the road/ does play in the road, you would\u2019ve had that conversation if you really wanted the problem solved. \n\nYou are also an AH for how you spoke to some of the commenters asking you questions when you came here for judgement. People like you should be banned from posting, you came here, we didn\u2019t seek you out.", "NTA. If SIL is never willing to watch your kids, then you certainly don't owe it to her to watch hers.", "ESH. I get what you are saying. You really shouldn't have to watch her kid. But at the end of the day you are really just punishing your niece and your own kids. They are basically not being allowed to play with each other. A 9 year old really isn't a lot added if you are out there anyways. Even so, she shouldn't be your responsibility. I think the bigger issue is that you SIL parenting annoys you. I'm sure you are much more sensitive to shitty parents given your childhood. You probably hates that she gets away with being a neglectful parent. You doing these things will not make SIL a better parent. She will always be a shitty parent. Playing with her cousins is probably one of your niece's very few sources of happiness since she has a neglectful parent. There has to be a better solution though. For example, maybe setting specific days your niece is allowed to come over and/or the SIL has to agree that she will no longer let her daughter do the things you don't allow your kids to do.", "I'm leaning towards ESH here.\n\nIf you're already outside and the cousin is playing with your kids I don't see why it's such a big deal to watch your niece/nephew. \n\nI only say this because you actually are in potential of putting a strain on the relationship between your kids and their cousin. I grew up constantly around my cousins and all 5 of us look at each other like siblings, we literally all hangout together constantly, so maybe I'm biased and worried you're potentially robbing them of that sort of relationship. \n\nYes your SIL is a bigger AH for assuming you're okay just watching her kid, but if you're watching your kids play outside, I think it's kind of bizarre to sort of encourage an environment where you're not okay watching any one else's kids play with your kids. If it was a random group of kids strolling outside and they wanted to play with your kids, would you shoo them away as well? It's not like you can't tell your niece/nephew to go home when you guys go back inside.\n\nIf your niece/nephew is a total brat and handful to deal with, then my opinion changes to NTA, but otherwise, ESH", "ESH (SIL sucks much more) - I understand that your youngest has some issues, but you do sound like a helicopter mom. Kids that age are able to play outside together with so long as they follow the rules (physical boundaries of the yard, sticking together). \n\nIs the issue that the daughter doesn\u2019t play safely like you describe in the update? Or is this issue that you want to watch the kids and you want to demand that SIL watch them too. \n\nI think the aspect of the other kid playing in the street is a big issue. And it\u2019s a liability for you. So, that\u2019s super valid. But you seem mad that SIL doesn\u2019t helicopter parent like you do. A young kid is the one who is really being punished and I find that really sad.", "None of those kids need constant supervision. You\u2019re setting them up for future failure. YTA.", "**YTA**\n\nIt doesn't sound like your SIL needs you to watch her kid or is evening asking you to watch her kid. Your children might need to be supervised at all times, but not every kid needs that level of attention. You said yourself that she lets her daughter play outside by herself all the time. It's also pretty reasonable to believe that she is encouraging her daughter to go play with other children, not be watched by you. Other children who are her cousins/family. \n\nThis feels more like you're judging her and it comes at the cost of alienating your niece. Because if she comes out and you call your kids in and avoid her, you're making her feel terrible. That *kid* is your kids' family.", "Is it really a big deal if hannah comes out to play with ur kids? I rly dont get the annoyance here. Why cant ya just get along", "ESH is my default on in-law drama", "YTA.  She's not expecting you to babysit her kid, because her kid is 9 and can play without adult supervision.  If your kids are pissed off that her parents are less strict, so what?  That's part of life.  Don't keep the kids apart just because you're bitter your SIL is more laissez-faire than you.", "No verdict. No, actually YTA \n\nfor not allowing your kids to play outside just because another kid is out, and ONLY because the kids parent isnt  ALSO out with them. It seems there was literally no other reason.\n\nGenerally i would say helicopter parents are AHs - to their kids and their futute ability to think for themselves. This is more a parenting question than it is a AITA question. SIL is doing it the european way, it seems you do the american way. \n(when i was 6, from some point on i walked to kindergarten alone/w other kids, about 500-700m, crossing at least one \"major\" road)\n\nYou are exhausting yourself watching your kids, and your SIL trusts her daughter enough that she wouldnt need supervision 24/7. Obviously you were bound to clash if you try to enforce your views on each other.", "NTA - she should at least be paying you.", "NAH. I mean, you don\u2019t have to watch your niece so she can play with her cousins. It\u2019s weird of you though. It\u2019s also weird how judgmental you are of SIL. The playing game comment?

I feel bad for the kids it\u2019s really not that serious.", "I agree and am shocked we\u2019re in the minority lol the oldest is 12!! Why is he being given the same rules as an adhd 6 year old. That\u2019s unfair. \n\nWhat do the kids want?? Do the older two want to go out and play?? Again, different ages different rules. This works with my 5 and 9 year old. Eldest has adhd but has been in therapy and meds for years. He is beyond trustworthy (now). \n\nAlso yeah, why can\u2019t you just sit on the porch for a bit with the younger? Say okay 30 min I\u2019ll watch you guys with bikes in the street. Extra 30 minutes I\u2019ll watch. Then little guy comes in with me, I\u2019ll check every 10-15 min, stay IN the yard or we will never do this again, get me if there\u2019s an issue. Also yell fire.", "Yup", "Agreed. These kids aren't toddlers. Let them play.", "You sound like you\u2019ve never had to be responsible for children. Or if you have, I\u2019m shocked they\u2019re all still alive. I hope OP reads this and laughs because I couldn\u2019t write a more ridiculous response if I tried.", "My SIL would never pay anyone to watch her kid. She once wanted me to take Hannah for 2 weeks so her and her husband could go to Florida and when I said she would need to pay me so I could feed her, she said I was ridiculous because \"we are family so I don't know why you'd expect payment\". She thinks my son or myself should just watch Hannah because we are family. I won't even let my son watch his siblings unless it's an absolute emergency because I don't want to partentify him.", "SIL\u2019s daughter is 9 not 6.\n\nBut this was my take too! The one losing out in the end is SIL\u2019s daughter. She\u2019s the one being penalized in all this.", "My 12yo is allowed to play outdoors without supervision. My 10yo and 6yo are not, for the simple fact that whenever my SILs kid tells them it's okay to be in the street with her, they listen to her and end up out there. Which they have been spoken to about multiple times but you know. Keeps happening the second I turn my back.", "My kids are 6, 10 and 12. Her kid is 9.", "All I can think of is all the abducted kids........", "I wouldn't say she's a complete handful. The big issue is that she is allowed to play in the street and my kids are not. It almost always leads to a argument because she will badger me about letting my kids play in the street with her because her mom said it was okay. Then it turns in to my kids being jerks to me because I stand by my \"no\".", "Yeah it\u2019s giving weird surveillance energy. They\u2019re in the yard! Why can\u2019t they just be in the yard? What in the panopticon hell.", "Then according to you op doesn't need to be outside period. Playing in the street is not ok and if something happens asthe9 y o doesn't listen to op to get off the road op would be blamed.\n\nNTA op", "I'm not going to bring in my \"problem child\" so he feels left out, just so another kid can come play. What kind of bullshit is that? Lmfao \"yeah I need to make sure to keep MY kid indoors so another kid I didn't parent can have fun\".", "Why?", "Do you know what it means to loosen the apron strings?", "That \"it takes a village stuff\" is bullshit.", "My uncles and aunts took care of me and my siblings for 8 weeks when my parents were on pilgrimage (they were supposed to only be 4 weeks, but the travel agent didn't book the return tickets and they couldn't get the money together to book alternatives).\n\nThey took care of everyone else's kids at various points as well\n\nAlso when I was 12, I was going upto half a mile down the road to the local park by myself on my scooter\n\nOP seems a little overprotective of the older kids", "I was thinking more about contagious diseases, such as colds, where you don't want the kids making each other sick.  But the asthma is a good point.  I'm not sure I'd trust her to be watchful for asthma attacks.  But she can reciprocate with other ways of helping, if she wants your help. \n\nAre you in the US/Canada?  With your child having asthma, be careful about outside play if you're in an area that's affected by wildfire smoke right now.  The air quality is horrible, and can make asthma worse, plus many of the fine particulates released by the partial combustion of a wildfire are carcinogens, which could cause your children long term problems. If you are in the US, [AirNow.gov](https://AirNow.gov) is a good resource for checking your local air quality, to give you information to plan what activities are safe.  An AQI of 100 or higher is considered \"unsafe for sensitive groups\" which would include your son, due to his asthma.  Quiet activities indoors, ideally with windows shut and a HEPA filter running in the room, may be a safer choice for him.", "By ASD do you mean autism?", "Well NTA then neither can you", "So I wouldn't do the paid angle I would lean into the \"sorry that is two many kids and I can barely Handel my own\"", "Oh man, NTA! I would do the exact same thing as you. It blows my mind that people just let their kids run around outside for hours unattended without even having them check in. My kids are absolutely not allowed to do that stuff. Let her think whatever she wants of you, she is the one that isn\u2019t even watching her child.", "Same. I was a latchkey kid at five, walked to and from school alone. In 4th grade I would walk home some days on the highway with a friend and our shortcut included shimmying across a drainpipe over a huge ravine. Different times and not in a good way.", "I agree 100%", "The oldest one is 12 he is about to be in middle school he should be allowed to go out on his own within reason. OP won\u2019t even let him bike in the street lol that\u2019s a bit much don\u2019t ya think? They\u2019re not even on a main road just near it. I get if she\u2019s worried about the younger kids but if they\u2019re all playing IN the yard the 12 year old can easily keep an eye on them and get mom or her sister if needed. She is a self stated helicopter parent and her kids are gonna suffer from it.", "I have a son and two step children. They somehow managed to survive childhood and become thriving adults. I also worked in day care for many years. All those kids seemed to do perfectly well. So I really don't think you know what you're talking about.", "Welp.... if that's the case stand your ground. What have you got to lose?", "An older child occasionally babysitting siblings is not \"parentifying\". I watched my sisters for an hour or two starting when I was 12 (same age gaps as your kids) so my mom could run to the grocery store or whatever and have some peace.\n\nMy youngest sister also has severe asthma and was hospitalized with collapsed lungs and pneumonia constantly. My mom never hovered nearby with her inhaler \"just in case\". They were left in a place we all knew about and everyone knew how to recognize an asthma attack.\n\nHovering and smothering your kids could lead to the resentment you're so worried about causing with regards to parentification.", "I was playing basically unsupervised by the time I was about 8 or 9; there were always other kids around and we never went outside the neighbourhood.", "Wow, times have changed! At 12, I was not only staying home alone occasionally, I was babysitting other people's kids! I think I was allowed out with no supervision around 5 or 6, so I can see keeping your neurodivergent kid under a closer eye, but I can't imagine why you think you need to watch the 10 and 12 year old. In four years your oldest will be driving", "imagine being 12 and not being able to be outside because \"the neighbours kid is outside, but their parent isnt. Mom doesnt like that, thats why you cant be outside anymore\"\n\nsounds like bs to me", "Umm, the 9, 10 and 12 year olds are quite old enough to be playing together outside without your supervision.\n\nIf you're restricting the rest of them to only being outside supervised due to the 6yo, you're really limiting them.\n\nAlso the 12yo is probably old enough to supervise the 6yo without you ...", "Man, she I was 6 I walked my sibling to school and prelareenything needed. And this is in a quite large city. How does she dare even expect you to also take another child she she's literally doing nothing?", "Idk i feel I would just give the \"your mom isn't their parent\" speech and if they continued pressing, just send them back to their house or talk to the mom about teaching her kid to respect other parents wishes.\n\nYour SIL seems very neglectful though, sending her kid outside and letting them play in the street unsupervised is concerning", "\u201cjust so Another kid can come play\u201d. That kid you have such disdain for is your NIECE, and in return you are leaving HER out when you all so obviously pack it up and go in when she comes out. \n\nI thought my mom was overbearing and insufferable with her hovering. you may be e en worse. My moms overbearing ways affected her children well into their adult lives. Love and care\nFor your children but don\u2019t stunt them. \n\nYTA.", "When I was 13 I had 8 cousins and 2 nephews younger than me. We spent all our holidays together and had a great time hanging out and playing together. The youngest child was only 1 yr old and we would go to ice cream parlours and snack joints in a huge group (just 1 other adult for supervision). We all understood that whoever the adult was with us made the rules and everyone had to abide by them. The older kids took care of the younger ones. Guess what - we are all in our 40s and 50s and still very close to each other. \n\nNo it was not parentification. It's just being responsible and learning to care for family.", "Yes, it stands for autism spectrum disorder", "It's not even a random kid, it's their cousin / OP's niece!!", "Is it parentifying if at 12yo you're babysitting other families for cash because you chose to do it? I mean, that's what I was doing at 12yo.\n\nAt 12yo my kid would have been mortified if I was still supervising him outside. But he pretty much had free range of about a mile around our house, a bike, and a scooter at that point. He and the neighborhood kids were out and about, not in front of our house.\n\nOh, and he was \"playing in the road\" because he was riding his bike in the road instead of on the sidewalk because that's what's legally required.", "My 12yo is not a parent and therefore he is not going to be in charge of keeping watch of other children. I'm the parent, not him. I did not ask for judgement on what you would do in this situation. I asked if I'm an AH for not watching my SILs kid while she's outdoors.", "Yeah that's an every day conversation between her and I. Doesn't help that when I speak to SIL about it, she says \"well she's allowed to play in the street and nothing's ever happened so I don't see a big deal here\". It's just a constant fight.", "I was playing unsupervised by the time I was 8, as long as my sister, who is about 3 years younger than I, and I were with other kids and stayed in the neighbourhood.", "Or Atrial septal defect.", "There's no cash involved, and sis has never offered to pay either of them for babysitting.", "But you don't need to watch SIL's kid, you're only acting like you are. You're actively not letting your children play with their cousin. It's lonely being an only child and if I hadn't had my cousins to play with I would have been very sad.", "But how much do you actually have to watch a 9 year old? Are you often telling her to get out of things or stay in the yard? Most kids that age can play outside and go to their friends house with 0 supervision.", "I'm sorry but that's bullshit. You are raising your kids to be afraid of their own shadows and unable to take care of themselves for even 5 minutes without mommy holding their hand. You don't need to supervise a 12 and a 10 year old in a suburban area in your own backyard. That's ridiculous. At that age I was taking public transport to go to school on my own everyday and going on school trips abroad where we definitely weren't being micromanaged like this.", "Ok,\n\nYTA for believing that you should be watching the 9yo and taking your kids away because you don't want to supervise.\n\nStop directly supervising all the older kids and let them play.", "It\u2019s not parentifying unless you expect the older one to watch them for hours or days while you work or something. Having the 12 year old keep an eye on the younger ones while they all play is called being a responsible brother not forcing them to be a \u2018parent\u2019 lol. Give the kids a break they will suffer from your constant helicopter parenting.", "See that's a very dangerous mentality. Of course nothing bad happens, until it does, and if/when it does, it's catastrophic.", "I mean it\u2019s not babysitting lol", "There\u2019s no reason to babysit, the sister doesn\u2019t care if her daughter is unsupervised OP took it upon herself to think they need constant supervision and now all the kids are being punished for it. Especially in the yard for Christ sake most kids at those ages beside the 6 year old should be allowed to play in the neighborhood and use there bikes and scooters without a helicopter parent worried the whole time.", "I'm constantly having to tell her to get out of the street because she doesn't move for oncoming vehicles. Or telling her to stop calling my kids to the street, since she's allowed to play out there.", "NTA if something happens because she plays in the street you will be blamed . Good on you for not putting responsibility on your older kids."]}
