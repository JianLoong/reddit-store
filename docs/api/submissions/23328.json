Somebody else's behavior sucks, and you're justifiably angry.\n2. You let it go on till you're super mad.\n3. You take an action against the person that is extreme enough to express all that saved-up anger.\n4. Now instead of paying ANY attention to the initial issue, the other person is (pretty justifiably) super pissed about YOUR outrageous behavior.\n\nEnd result, NO PROGRESS on the original issue, and not only does the other person now hate you, their friends and family also think you're completely nutballs for YOUR extreme behavior.\n\nRight now, she is the only AH in this situation. If you threw her possessions away, clearly ESH.", "Yes, YTA if you do that.\n\nWhat you need to do is start dealing with the problem, not being passive aggressive.\n\nTell her you're going to start only doing your own laundry and cleaning up only your own stuff.  Tell her  if she leaves stuff piled up in a common area, you're just going to dump it beside her bed where she can deal with.\n\nFrankly you should probably be having a much broader conversation about how she needs to become a full contributor to your family, and if she won't, well, you can evaluate whether you're prepared to keep being taken for granted.  I eventually left a relationship like that once.\n\nBut throwing stuff away (that you will end up having to replace) because you'd rather be passive aggressive isn't going to achieve anything.", "No, i suggest u start putting it in trash bags in-front of her. And if she doesn\u2019t want it thrown away she can pick it up and put it away herself. I don\u2019t think you should actually throw it away just act like u will. Have u ever been with little kids and have to threaten to throw their toys away so they\u2019ll pick up? Like that", "INFO Why isn't she cleaning up after herself?", "Don't throw her things away you'll make everything worse. Instead have a serious conversation about her behavior and how you can't tolerate it anymore.", "NTA for being frustrated but stop throwing her stuff out. You need to have a serious talk with her. Something is not right. Did she lose her job? Medical problems? Depression? Something is causing her to be basically checked out.", "NTA\n\nWhere are all of the calls of weaponized incompetence and carrying the mental load? \n\nBetween the group telling the OP to talk it out( even though he clearly stated that he already did that ) and the armchair psychologists, it never fails that this sub turns from a judgement sub to an advice sub whenever a woman is at fault.", "I personally wouldn't throw others stuff away. But I would be insanely frustrated as you are. But she will never change. This is the way she will be all the time now. She sounds lazy and unappreciative of what you do. Also very hypocritical of her to expect your daughter to do it but won't lift a finger herself. Hopefully you can get her to do her part. But I fear that won't happen and you will either have to put up with it or move on.", "ESH. \n\nLike totally understand the frustration, but you ultimately know the reaction to your plans so you're making a bad situation worse. Throwing her stuff out isn't going to have her suddenly do the things that you're wanting. \n\nI'd sit down and tell her you're growing resentment for how little you feel she does and ask that you each can divide these things more fairly and actually do them, because it's going to be a stupid thing that ends up breaking the relationship if it continues.", "YWBTA for throwing her things away.  Find a containment strategy you can live with, like a laundry basket that sits in the corner or in a closet.  When she doesn\u2019t put her stuff away, it takes about 10 seconds to toss it in there", "NTA. It was E S H but I read your comments that \u201cher stuff\u201d being thrown away is literal garbage.

Tell wifey that you will no longer tolerate her behavior and if she wants to be a child you will treat her as a child.  Make a chore list and she needs to complete x number of items on the chore chart each day.  Start controlling the access to the money.  Dishes not done?  Then you take daughter out for a meal and leave mom at home because she has too much to do to be able to go.  Do your and the daughters laundry and show her how to put it away and keep her room nice.

Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see the forest for the trees.", "Excellent take. TY.", "Because she\u2019s lazy. She lived with her parents when we met and Dad was a clean freak, so she never had to. That\u2019s my assumption anyway. Her car is a mess; mine is clean. Her clothes are everywhere; mine are neatly folded or hung up. She sits on the couch while I cook dinner and then back to the couch while I clean up. I avoid confrontation because she loses her temper or runs away and there\u2019s no closure.

Usually, if one person cooks, the other person does the dishes.   Obviously if someone isn't feeling well, or has to go out, or whatever, we just handle it, but even just having this basic, adult understanding of a \"fair\" division of effort over meals makes it tension free.  \n\nIt's a basic question of respect for your partner, which you deserve.", "Why are you with her then?", "I agree to an extent. But leading by example is always better.

But when there are 4 sets of half-empty shampoo/conditioner bottles collecting in the shower and have been there for 5 months and it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s using them, I toss a set. Random papers and receipts that don\u2019t serve a purpose: gone. All the hangars and labels that come with new clothes that she takes off and leaves on the dresser: trash. It\u2019s more cleaning up after her. Or I fold my laundry and the kids\u2019 laundry, but just add hers to the pile.", "Why u gotta focus on what they can\u2019t do\ud83d\ude2d", "That does make a difference. \n\nBut ultimately you need to talk to her, because doing all this is clearly frustrating for you. Understandably. \nI know you said you've talked about it. And this is just a guess, but I'm assuming you've told her things like \"you need to pick up your stuff\" \"I'm sick of cleaning up after you\" \n\nBut I think (if you haven't already) then you need to have a really frank discussion, where you sit down and tell her how much this is bothering you, how it's impacting how you feel about her and how it will continue to impact the relationship you have. This is the kind of stuff people let stew for years. It slowly makes the two of you drift apart, understandably and then it either ends with you showing your kids a noncommutative relationship, that's full of resentment and unhealthy, or you likely end the relationship. \n\nAsk her how she sees the house. Does the mess bother her, does she feel she could do more or is she also feeling she's at capacity? You didn't mention if she is working, full time? Part time? Is she a SAHM? How many kids do you have, is she default parent, does she feel she doesn't have time for this. \n\nYou need to work together for a solution. I think it's easy for the parent who goes out to work to think \"she's got loads of time, she's home all day....\" But sometimes got the primary parent they can also feel they are drowning. Help each other out. She shouldn't be doing nothing, but you need to be aware if she is doing stuff that you simply don't see. \n\nIf after a chat you both feel she's doing enough or simply not coping well with balance and you're clearly finding it all too much, then consider if you can afford a cleaner now and again.", "In that case NTA. But has she been evaluated for depression or is she just lazy? Either way there needs to be a serious conversation here and she needs to get medical help if needed & pull her own weight.", "I don't I was clarifying my prior comment. but when they put a stick in a fire and try to light a patch of dry grass with it or pick up a hammer (currently using i dont just leave them about) so they can \" fix a window\" which isnt broken. I have to tell them not to. I do distract them by getting them to \"help\" with what I'm doing so they can learn.
