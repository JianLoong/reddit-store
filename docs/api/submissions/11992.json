During the worst parts of his illness I was frequently cleaning up after him, his vomiting, his loss of bowel control. I pulled muscles and injured myself helping him move. He found that emasculating. So I can see how he'd find it appealing that someone still saw him as the old him when he was healthy and strong and I became the nurse figure. So I tell myself that and I don't hate him.\n\nBut I went years without sex because he was sick. The loss of libido was an expected temporary side effect of his medication. I accepted that and made do with being celibate. I feel guilty talking about how painful it was because I should be greatful he survived and that is so trivial given the situation. But I would masturbate in hiding, didn't even get a vibrator because I didn't want him feel bad or awful for not being able to do it.

None. And, honestly, I\u2019m happy I did. As it turns out, on my dads side, my family is a bit, shall I say, weird? They\u2019ve got a lot of views and beliefs that I strictly disagree with and they have this extremely fake persona that I also don\u2019t like. They\u2019re not great people in my eyes and I\u2019m very thankful I didn\u2019t have to grow up around them and be forced into their lives and make a connection with them. They\u2019re exhausting people. \n\nEspecially now that I\u2019m older and more opinionated, I\u2019m even more glad. As I got older, I started to learn more family secrets that I was able to process and understand. A lot of this information involves my mom - honestly, she had a pretty crappy childhood and an even crappier adulthood. I wish she didn\u2019t have to go through that even though it means I\u2019d never have been born. It wasn\u2019t anything super over the top, but it was a very large amount of her sacrificing her life to take care of 2 kids while my dad went off to war. I can definitely tell she regrets this. Now, why is this relevant? Because your kids, one day, are going to learn what\u2019s happening to you right now one way or another. Then, they\u2019re going to see their grandparents veeeeery differently, and it will probably possibly turn hostile.\n\nI know you want to protect your kids and allow your grandparents to be in their life, but take it from someone who didn\u2019t have that - I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care that they weren\u2019t involved because, well, I just don\u2019t. They probably won\u2019t either. They will, however, care when they realize the horrible people their grandparents are. Kids notice a lot more than you realize. It\u2019s the same thing as staying in a marriage for kids - don\u2019t do it. It fucks up your kids beyond belief. This will do less damage overall since it\u2019s grandparents, but damage will still be done. \n\nDon\u2019t keep family in your life because you think it\u2019ll benefit the kid.

Dump the toxicity from your life. It's only another form of cancer. You don't need it.", "They are not good grandparents. They allowed their grandkids dad to run around on their mom while he was staying with them. This led to their grandkids family breaking apart.\n\nWhat they are doing with your kids is done out of guilt and as a way to keep tabs on you.\n\nThey and their future sidepiece-in-law can worry about him and they can buy another house where you don't have to worry about them trying to pile up at your house to visit their cheater son/boyfriend. Make no mistake, if your ex comes to your house, they will all expect you to be courteous and allow them and the sidepiece to stay at your home to be close to the cheater.\n\nYou don't owe them anything. Your vows said in sickness AND IN health. Not in sickness so he can get healthy and cheat with the help of his parents. He broke the vows and left the marriage. You are no longer obligated to him.\n\nAnd don't let them pull the \"what about the kids card\". If he was worried about his kids, them he would have been spending as much time with them as possible, especially since he could have actually died. If his parents cared about the kids, they wouldn't have given him a place to stay so he could continue to cheat. If the sidepiece cared about the kids, she wouldn't have jumped in bed and pursued a relationship with their married father, wrecking their life.\n\nTell this family of cheaters and enablers no and start blocking numbers.

At all. You\u2019re just a resource to them. Stop doing their jobs and fixing their messes.", "What kind of \u201cgood\u201d grandparents allow and encourage the parent of their grandchildren to carry on an affair?", "I\u2019d sell the house regardless. In their eyes they own half of the house because they contributed to half of the original purchase cost. To them it will always be the house that they paid for. Sell the house and buy a different house. New house, new start.", "They\u2019re also not good grandparents if they condone their father cheating on their mother. The audacity of these people!", "If they are applying pressure now, I\u2019d suggest putting it on the market now to sell. Whether you you sell immediately or in the next year,  the house being in the market adds a physical hurdle to him moving in. Also it gives you time to have frank age appropriate conversations about how the \u201cDisney dad\u201d is to you and what his family is expecting of you and cheating circumstance that broke up your family, if you haven\u2019t already", "Half the down payment.* Which is probably 5%-10% of the purchase cost."]}
