He loves them and is loved by them. \n\nWhen I look at it as an outside observer, I can understand what he was going through in falling in love with someone else. During the worst parts of his illness I was frequently cleaning up after him, his vomiting, his loss of bowel control. I pulled muscles and injured myself helping him move. He found that emasculating. So I can see how he'd find it appealing that someone still saw him as the old him when he was healthy and strong and I became the nurse figure. So I tell myself that and I don't hate him.\n\nBut I went years without sex because he was sick. The loss of libido was an expected temporary side effect of his medication. I accepted that and made do with being celibate. I feel guilty talking about how painful it was because I should be greatful he survived and that is so trivial given the situation. But I would masturbate in hiding, didn't even get a vibrator because I didn't want him feel bad or awful for not being able to do it.

None. And, honestly, I\u2019m happy I did. As it turns out, on my dads side, my family is a bit, shall I say, weird? They\u2019ve got a lot of views and beliefs that I strictly disagree with and they have this extremely fake persona that I also don\u2019t like. They\u2019re not great people in my eyes and I\u2019m very thankful I didn\u2019t have to grow up around them and be forced into their lives and make a connection with them. They\u2019re exhausting people. \n\nEspecially now that I\u2019m older and more opinionated, I\u2019m even more glad. As I got older, I started to learn more family secrets that I was able to process and understand. A lot of this information involves my mom - honestly, she had a pretty crappy childhood and an even crappier adulthood. I wish she didn\u2019t have to go through that even though it means I\u2019d never have been born. It wasn\u2019t anything super over the top, but it was a very large amount of her sacrificing her life to take care of 2 kids while my dad went off to war. I can definitely tell she regrets this. Now, why is this relevant? Because your kids, one day, are going to learn what\u2019s happening to you right now one way or another. Then, they\u2019re going to see their grandparents veeeeery differently, and it will probably possibly turn hostile.\n\nI know you want to protect your kids and allow your grandparents to be in their life, but take it from someone who didn\u2019t have that - I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care that they weren\u2019t involved because, well, I just don\u2019t. They probably won\u2019t either. They will, however, care when they realize the horrible people their grandparents are. Kids notice a lot more than you realize. It\u2019s the same thing as staying in a marriage for kids - don\u2019t do it. It fucks up your kids beyond belief. This will do less damage overall since it\u2019s grandparents, but damage will still be done. \n\nDon\u2019t keep family in your life because you think it\u2019ll benefit the kid.

She was helping her husband through his sickness for YEARS.  Later, she found out he was cheating on her after he recovered.  They ended up splitting up.  \n\nThat kind of hurt never goes away.  I understand you not wanting to house him/see him/become his caretaker again.  That\u2019s not only emotionally draining, but physically as well.  NTA.", "NTA.\n\nMy opinion may sound harsh, but it is the pragmatic reality of divorce. The choice is 100% yours, and this is why...\n\nWhen you get divorced, unless it is explicitly written in the settlement, all obligations and entitlements cease to exist. You got the house, so he has no more right to it than would some stranger.  End of story.  You also no longer have a personal commitment to each other, so he has no right to expect you to do anything for him.  You owe him nothing, and he doesn't owe you.  That ended the day those papers were signed.\n\nYou can choose to stay involved to any extent that you both agree upon, and you can just as freely decide to cut him out of your life completely (except for co-parenting if applicable, of course). Neither of those scenarios is \"wrong.\"\n\nSo.... tune out all that noise from him and his family.  Think about what is right for *you*.  Do not let them manipulate you.  If you sincerely believe you should help him, then go ahead and do so.  But if you don't, your conscience should be clear.", "NTA. It really does suck that he's sick again, but that's a \"Him\" problem now, not an \"OP\" problem. I'm sorry you had to go through with that, and you seem very nice and kind and not bitter. Don't let the in-laws or ex mess with you. What's he planning on doing with the gf, when he's staying at your house,? Bringing her also? I couldn't deal with that, not that soon for sure and I highly doubt your ex MIL would put up with it either, if she were in your shoes. It's weird how some people expect others to do shit they personally would not put up with. And if people are saying do it for your kids, have they asked your kids? Obviously they love their dad, but a lot of kids are happy to have the divorced parents apart. Definitely NTA\n\nEdit: that's YOUR house, don't let anyone bully you or push your boundaries. Sounds like you gave up a lot when he got sick", "you took care of him, the kids, and the house, and was basically there for him at his lowest, and this is what he did to you? that\u2019s so fucked. the fact that they got engaged on the day that your guy\u2019s divorce was finalized?? and the fact that your ex-in laws were supporting his behavior and are going on social media saying that his new gf has always been there and has always made him laugh is so fucked up. like what about you? you were legit there for him through thick and thin, and you get no appreciation? wtf? and they now are telling you that he should stay in the house that he sold for you? they want him back into your life? THE AUDACITY! it\u2019s like they want to re-traumatize you again bruh. \n\ntbh you don\u2019t owe them shit anymore. he\u2019s your ex husband, why can\u2019t his mistress take care of him?? why can\u2019t his parents take care of him?? i\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this OP.", "NTA.\n\n>His parents feel that I owe him for getting the house and should let him stay there for the 2-3 months his treatment is at the facility\n\nNo. He owed you for taking care of him and the household while he fucked off when he recovered. That's your house. \n\nIf he wants to stay close by the hospital, he can get an apartment. If he wants to see the kids while he's there, sure. He doesn't get to come back when it's hard. \n\n>especially not if I end up being his nurse and caretaker again\n\nThat's what they all want. Don't stop what you're doing. If they want him to have somewhere to live, there's apartments, Airbnb's, and hotels.

AND announced his engagement to her after the divorce! Oh heck no NTA! Don't let him or his parents guilt you you into having him stay there. If they try telling you oh well he let you have the house remind him and everyone else how he cheated and it's his way of a sorry ass apology of cheating. Like your over here taking care of him the kids and dealing with insurance and here he is laughing at his clown ass gf jokes.. you have every right to be bitter..I would too. So no he can't stay. His clown gf can help him during this rough time for him .let's see who's laughing now. It's obviously none of my business but this makes me so mad! Plz update us OP!!!!!!", "Heck no, let his new partner take care of him. You have paid your dues. He should sort his accommodation without involving you.", "NTA. people who use their partner as caretakers while cheating on them is messed up. ungrateful guy.", "there are other ways to be supportive without having him in YOUR home. being supportive is not limited to physically bearing the burden. other people, i\u2019m sure, are being \u201csupportive\u201d and they are not cleaning up his body fluids. be like them. be supportive from a safe distance. do not enmesh your daily life back with this emotional leech. you have an abundance of love and kindness. give some to yourself and your kids as they go thru their dad\u2019s illness. kids are often ignored and they can use a bunch of love too. look into that and see what you can do to support them instead. their dad already has all the support he needs.", "Sometimes you have to suffer the results of your own actions.  I feel much empathy toward you and your ex-husband.  Cancer is a nightmare, but that doesn't excuse the harm he caused you and your family.  Everyone who thinks he should stay with you needs to go away because they have no say in your life now.  They should pay for him to stay somewhere if they are that concerned.", "His new girlfriend and he should just move closer to the hospital. You made sacrifices so why shouldn\u2019t she. You are NTA.", "Please don't do this.  I wouldn't ask my ex husband for the time of day, much less to take care of me in the event of cancer.  Tell him, his mistress, his parents, and anyone else that thinks you should take care of him to take a long walk off a short pier.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t spend his healthy days away from you, he spent them cheating on you. Nothing forgives what he put you through not even cancer.", "The idea that this request is just an offer of a place to stay is so obtuse; you\u2019ll be expected to treat him civilly and help him when he\u2019s in need, and not just that, you\u2019ll need to hide any tension and hurt and resentment from your children, making YOUR home no longer a place of rest and safety. This is an unfair ask, and you saying no doesn\u2019t reflect poorly on you. It\u2019s a consequence for his poor judgement and weak character.", "Follow your heart - no matter what your decision is, you are not TAH.", "Oh, wow, some people really do have the audacity. Everything you have given him, all the time, energy, emotional support, financial support, raising his kids, and he just dumps you like that. And still thinks he is entitled to ANYthing else from you? No. Cancer does not give anyone the license to be a total AH. The house belongs to you, it's the least you deserve. NTA", "I\u2019m sure they would be better off renting him a place so he can bring the woman who always cheers him up with him. No way do you deserve to be playing nurse maid to a man who cheated on you, while you helped nurse him back to health. I would just say sorry no can\u2019t help this time, I have a full time job and kids to raise, this time is all on his fianc\u00e9. NTA in anyway", "NTA. Tell him to make you an offer to buy you out. Otherwise, he chose to not be your responsibility when he ended the marriage, so he can figure it out without you. He\u2019s someone else\u2019s concern now.  Love, a cancer survivor that never used it as an excuse to be an asshole. Ps- my family would\u2019ve never backed up my behavior if I did that.", "NTA. His girlfriend can take care of him. He betrayed your trust and you don't owe him anything. \n\nYour kids can visit their dad. Don't be a doormat to him.", "NTA. Tell him and his parents that While you have a certain amount of empathy for his situation, your own hurt and resentment after he betrayed and abandoned you has poisoned the well. It would be extremely unhealthy for both of you to even attempt to share a roof for a single night, much less for the entire course of his treatment. You are personally unwilling to be his personal caregiver and you will not tolerate having \"a stranger\" in your home to care for him - and for the record, it wasn't \"generosity\" on his part, it was \"the least he could do.\"", "You took care of him the first time, he rewarded you with a mistress and a divorce. \" Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me\".

You owe them nothing.", "PLEASE put yourself first for once! That man is horrid garbage and hoping for free care! Let his mistress figure his care out. It's not your responsibility at all!

He didn\u2019t exactly \u201cgive\u201d you the house. Had you went to court he probably would have been lost it to you anyway as you were paying majority on it and it\u2019s the kids home.

Cancer or no, he\u2019s brought this on himself.", "NTA, so while you were caring for him and his chidren and dealing with his illness and working he reconnected with his old girlfriend and cheated on you resulting in the end of your relationship. You don't owe him a thing. He can rent a hotel when he needs to be in town for treatment. Since he had time to have a relationship with his ex-girlfriend while you were married during his last bout with cancer it seems like he doesn't need to be near the treatment center 24/7.", "Do they expect his affair partner/fianc\u00e9e to also stay in your home?", "NTA\n\nConstantly being the *bigger person* will chip YOU away to nothing.\n\nHe may be a *loving father* but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s a *good* father.\n\nHe spent his healthy time cheating and allowed his children to watch the worst without the best to give them comfort and hope.\n\nThat\u2019s selfish\u2026well before touching on his cheating, he didn\u2019t put them first, he won\u2019t now that he\u2019s sick and scared.\n\nIt\u2019ll just be a rerun of the first time only now your kids will be older and more able to see that it\u2019s okay to **use** people when you feel sad or sick.", "NTA, the more I read the madder I get at his audacity. Let him stay with his mom or get an Airbnb near the cancer center.", "NTA- If they feel he needs housing and a caretaker, his parents are more than welcome to take on that role.", "NTA.  What he did to you is pretty rough.  Tell his parents to butt out.  It isn't their call nor their business.  Tell Ex to get his girlfriend/fiancee/wife to take care of him.", "NTA do NOT let him in your house.", "NTA. OP you have shown more grace and kindness in even considering this than they have shown you throughout the whole ordeal. \nThey are trying to manipulate you into being his carer again, using your children to do so. You owe them nothing. \nThe house is yours, it was awarded to you and only you. His parents and the new GF can care for him this time, you have done more than your fair share.", "NTA in any way shape or form!", "NTA.  You need to focus on yourself, and your kids.  He, his wife, and his parents need to figure out his treatment.  He and his health, are no longer your responsibility.", "Nta gf can take care of him.

I might even offer it at full price to his parents/ex. Let them put their money where their mouth is. And let them hire a care taker for him or take care of him", "Ah hell no. It's the side chick's turn. NTA.", "OP, you are a treasure. It is not good for the kids for you to have suffer through letting him live in the house. You were the good and dutiful wife and mom.  He made his bed, which means when he went down this road he knew that he'd be accepting whatever comes with that path.  Very sorry that his family has put you in this position.\n\nLove to you and your children.", "Definitely NTA and big hugs to you for going through all this. \n\nFirstly, I know people are going to try to make you feel like you're standing in the way of him curing his cancer if you refuse his request to stay with you, so I want to make something clear to you. You are NOT preventing this man from receiving treatment. At most, you're slightly inconveniencing him. He is an adult who can figure out a different living situation that doesn't involve infiltrating your home and forcing you to be his unwilling caretaker and servant. Between him, his parents, and his fiance, they are more than capable of sorting out a different game plan. \n\nSecondly, I advise you to consider house hunting. This home legally doesn't have strings attached, but selling it to trade for a home of your own independent choosing will ensure that no entitled person will be able to truthfully assert that you somehow owe anything to the man who abused your  loyalty and betrayed you. Just download some house hunting apps and give it a peek at the very least. You might see something you really like in an area that you'd enjoy, and I think living in a place of your choosing versus a house that serves as a memory of your marriage might help you along in your healing journey.", "INFO:  Is she still in his life? Will they be expecting that she will be able to come to your house and visit him and hang out for hours at a time? \n\nI'd be really concerned that you may be the one he and his family have chosen because they think that they can most easily take advantage of you.", "NTA. Mom and dad can buy him and the GF a new house and then when he gets better and cheats on her, she can have that one.", "NTA. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Jvhk0uyIg) sums up how I feel. The new girlfriend and your in laws should be caring for him.\n\nThis kind of bullshit is well known in medicine. When my sister got cancer, she got the talk from the nurses how she may not see her partner anymore. Luckily she was with a very good man who stuck by her, but I've seen it happen to other patients often enough. The woman gets sick and is abandoned; the man gets sick and the wife puts in all the effort to helping him, only for her husband to whine about his needs and find a new woman as soon as he is better.\n\nDo not let him in the house. The divorce was a divorce. You are under no legal or moral obligation to care for him, full stop.", "Also with tenant laws can\u2019t he try to stay longer? Imagine if he gets his fianc\u00e9 to stay with them too and she also can\u2019t get kicked out. This is too much to ask.", "Please sell the house and move far away from these people.", "You have clearly never stepped on the metal jacks of my childhood!", "Holy shit."]}
