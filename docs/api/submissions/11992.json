They have no sympathy for cheaters, and probably think you\u2019re ex-husband deserves no sympathy.  \u201cHe reaps what he sows\u201d, will probably be a common response.\n\nI try to have a \u201cWhat would Jesus do\u201d mindset.  It\u2019s easy to help people who are good to you.  Helping someone who wronged you is very difficult, but very rewarding.  As long as you don\u2019t let him take advantage of your kindness.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019re technically NTA.  His parents are wrong for saying you owe him for getting you the house.  That\u2019s manipulation on their part.  Now that you\u2019re divorced, he\u2019s no longer your responsibility.  Letting him stay at your house would be an act of kindness, but not an act of obligation.\n\nDon\u2019t let hatred or anger motivate your decision, but do what you feel is best for everyone including yourself.", "NTA\n\nThe home is yours because of your kids and because he cheated.", "NTA\n\nYou received the house as part of your divorce settlement.  You could have gotten his retirement accounts or something similar instead of the house, if there were such assets to be had.  Stop thinking of the house as being \"given\" to you.  It was awarded to you as part of the divorce settlement, not \"given\" to you as prepayment for future caregiving.\n\nBut you getting assets from the divorce don't entitled your cheating Ex to free housing, utilities, food, and caregiving.  Your Ex and his AP can find their own housing near a cancer center.  \n\nIf it's important to his parents that your Ex get care and housing, they can figure out how to help provide that.  He's your Ex which means that it's no longer your responsibility.\n\n\"While I empathize with Ex's plight, I won't be housing nor providing care for him.  Due to the circumstances of our divorce, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to provide those services.  At this time, Ex needs the support of his family and close friends more than ever, and I am not longer either of those.  I hope that Ex recovers from his illness quickly, and I'll be praying for him.\"", "NTA He owed you the house for cheating on you. It's the mistress' job to buy a house near the hospital with him now.", "NTA\n\nNo way. Last time this happened you were married. Now you\u2019re not. Your duty to him is one of a co parent, not a spouse, which means you just have to keep the relationship between him and the kids front of mind. This doesn\u2019t extend to you letting him into what is now YOUR home. \n\nFurther, when you did take care of him as your wife, he cheated on you. Who knows what he will do when he is staying with you in the same position but only this time as your ex husband with really no duty to you. \n\nIf his parents are that concerned let them take care of him or at the very least fund that care themselves.", "NTA, having a cheating ex in your home is something no one could reasonably ask and if they're suggesting you owe it to him you might ask if you also owed him caring for him and the children during his treatment while he was off fucking his mistress.  NFW, those people have shown that they could not care less about your well being and you really shouldn't have them in your life anymore.", "NTA man has the audacity to cheat after you\u2019ve been keeping the ship afloat and taking care of him and everyone else alone? Sounds like karma is getting him now.", "NTA. Let his girlfriend take care of him.", "NTA.\n\nNo, you are not his nurse, his cleaning woman, his secretary, or his chef.\n\nHe screwed you over when you were nothing but supportive and caring, under the guise of needing space for his mental health. He's an asshole. Did he give you the house to apologize or has he always thought he could run back into your life when he chose to?\n\nYou don't owe him shit, and please feel free to let your former in laws know it.", "Ohhh man. I really was about to side with him until I got to the cheating part. NTA and I\u2019m sorry you had to spend so much of your emotional energy, time and money on him.", "It sounds like he was generous in the divorce, in a marriage your debt is the other's debt. \n\nA fair divorce would have meant selling the house, paying off his medical debts then splitting the money left over 50/50.\n\nI think because you're kind of in his debt you should do all you can to help him, so I think YTA if you don't", "NTA.  His parents and his fianc\u00e9e can take care of him and find a place locally for him to stay.  The house is not big enough for all of you and his caretakers.", "NTA. Even without the cheating and whatnot, caretaking is a full time job and it\u2019s very taxing emotionally, mentally, and physically. You\u2019re not his wife anymore. You have no obligation to do this.", "NTA - he f'ed around and found out that actions have consequences.\n\nThis goes under \"it would be nice\" - it would be nice for you to let him stay at the house but you are no means obligated to do so. And in your position, I don't think I would. It would just be too painful.", "NTA,  nta.  Just, no.  just.,  it is impossible.  just, - the in-laws, the ex, the wife, the messy part, and the smell, and the insults, the innuendo, the bad days, the crowded, the taking shifts, the caretaking, the sleeplessness.  Make a casserole, and send a card .", "I think you are going to have to approach this bluntly. Do not be nice. Tell your previous in laws that you don\u2019t want to be around a f*cking cheater. \nPeriod. Don\u2019t speak with them any more about this situation. Feel free to say this same thing to your former husband. Best of luck. NTA.", "NTA\nNothing is owed for the past. You ended the marriage on both your terms. \n\nIgnore your ex-in laws' comments. They're thinking of their son and have unreasonable expectations of you.\n\nIf you were to let him stay you would end up as his nurse, because you live there. He would be a heavy presence bringing up pain for you. And, gods forbid, he doesn't get better, you'll end up having to deal with all that awfulness. \n\nPlease don't put yourself through that.", "NTA. He wants the same dynamic as before, with the added benefit to him that he \"owes\" you nothing because you are no longer married, while benefiting from the fact that many people would feel obligated to look after the sick person staying in their home.\n\nHe gave up the house because he's an AH who cheated on the wife who sacrificed and stood by him while he was sick. His parents may have helped pay for the house, but *he* is the one who gave it away. \n\nYou aren't part of his support network anymore. It sucks that he's sick again, but that is not your problem, and you have no obligation or moral responsibility to help him in any way. He's on his own this time and it's his own fault.", "I am struggling with this so much. I don't think I hate him, a part of me still loves him as an old friend. I definitely wouldn't want my kids to suffer the devastation of losing their father. He loves them and is loved by them. \n\nWhen I look at it as an outside observer, I can understand what he was going through in falling in love with someone else. During the worst parts of his illness I was frequently cleaning up after him, his vomiting, his loss of bowel control. I pulled muscles and injured myself helping him move. He found that emasculating. So I can see how he'd find it appealing that someone still saw him as the old him when he was healthy and strong and I became the nurse figure. So I tell myself that and I don't hate him.\n\nBut I went years without sex because he was sick. The loss of libido was an expected temporary side effect of his medication. I accepted that and made do with being celibate. I feel guilty talking about how painful it was because I should be greatful he survived and that is so trivial given the situation. But I would masturbate in hiding, didn't even get a vibrator because I didn't want him feel bad or awful for not being able to do it. And all this time I was making do thinking he wasn't able to, he was sleeping with a whole another person. And that disloyalty still makes me cry.", "They announced their engagement the day the divorce was finalized. That still hurts so much.", "He cheated on her while she was taking care of him. She\u2019s definitely NTA. She doesn\u2019t owe him anything.", "Unless it's an at fault divorce, ie adultery. So, no. She doesn't owe him shit", "She\u2019s in his debt? Did you miss where she took care of him and their family during his cancer treatments? He owes her.", "Yikes. She took care of every single thing while he was sick, being a caretaker is extremely taxing. She carried their lives on her back and he still cheated on her. He\u2019s the reason they got divorced in the first place. The least he could do is take HIS medical debt with him and leave the house.", "\u201cIt would be nice\u201d if he didn\u2019t fuck another woman while he was married, too. I feel so bad for OP.", "NTA. Given all this, I don\u2019t think it would be wise to accommodate him, unless he\u2019s just coming for his treatment and then leaving immediately for wherever he lives now (so no caregiving duties are involved at your place).\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be his caregiver. His fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t be in your home to be his caregiver. Maybe if he had a 24/7 nurse it would be possible. But how comfortable would you be with his fianc\u00e9 visiting him within your home, even if she wasn\u2019t providing the caregiving?\n\nI think a better bet is helping them source a small rental, and maybe doing the sort of things you would do for a friend who you had a problematic history with. Providing some meals, or other means of support that don\u2019t involve you putting yourself in an awful position", ">He had fully recovered from his cancer by then. \n\nWell apparently not fully.   I actually don't think you have much choice here.   Your kid's father doesn't need to be stuck in a studio somewhere while going through whatever treatment he needs.  He needs his kids and to be surrounded by the familiar.\n\n>especially not if I end up being his nurse and caretaker again. \n\nHome health.   If his insurance won't pay for in-home care, his parents should.   That should be a hard line for you.", "I just read your above comment about how him and his affair partner are engaged.  If he\u2019s in a committed relationship, living with his ex-wife would be inappropriate.  I realize appropriateness isn\u2019t the biggest priority, but it could be a factor in your decision.", "This is so heart breaking to hear. Please don't give in. You owe him nothing. You sacrificed so much for him only for him to turn around and betray you. He has a fiance/wife. It's now her responsibility to take care of him.  You have to concentrate on taking care of yourself and your children.", "Oh what the fuck. I kind of hate this guy and I don\u2019t even know him", "I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel like a bad person because it\u2019s convenient for them. You\u2019ve suffered enough at his hands. He has a family. They will figure it out.  It\u2019s time you take care of you.", "Oh wow.  I am so sorry he put you through that.  NTA.", "He's definitely an A but it sounds like she got a lot more than 50/50 split from the divorce, which legally he would have been entitled to", "They were married during that time, isn't it expected?\n\nHe's definitely an A for cheating, don't get me wrong. But sounds like financially she got a much better deal in the divorce.", "Again, not in the case of an at-fault divorce for adultery. If she'd used the adultery against him, she could have kept the house, given him all of his debt, AND received a shit ton of alimony and child support, along with reimbursement for anything he spent on his affair.", "She deserved to get more in the divorce after he cheated.", "Loyalty and fidelity are also expected.", "Where on earth do you live that that's your laws?!", "The US... just because at fault divorces aren't the norm anymore, doesn't mean they don't still happen, especially in equitable distribution states."]}
