He loves them and is loved by them. \n\nWhen I look at it as an outside observer, I can understand what he was going through in falling in love with someone else. During the worst parts of his illness I was frequently cleaning up after him, his vomiting, his loss of bowel control. I pulled muscles and injured myself helping him move. He found that emasculating. So I can see how he'd find it appealing that someone still saw him as the old him when he was healthy and strong and I became the nurse figure. So I tell myself that and I don't hate him.\n\nBut I went years without sex because he was sick. The loss of libido was an expected temporary side effect of his medication. I accepted that and made do with being celibate. I feel guilty talking about how painful it was because I should be greatful he survived and that is so trivial given the situation. But I would masturbate in hiding, didn't even get a vibrator because I didn't want him feel bad or awful for not being able to do it.

Does she only accept him when he is healthy and you\u2019re supposed to do the hard work when he is sick? And then send him back to her when it\u2019s all going to be easy-peasy?

It's gross that anyone would try to make her feel guilty for not taking him in now. \n\n\n> He needs his kids \n\n\nActually, hard as it is to believe, it isn't all about him.

Fair for them? Because it's not. At all.

You owe both of them nothing. But be warned, they will absolutely try to alienate your children against you for denying them.
