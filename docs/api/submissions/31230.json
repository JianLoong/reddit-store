Your car woke your half-sister so he'll yell at you to make sure she stays awake?\n\nBy his actions, he seems to be on a power trip and is incredibly frustrated that the trip keeps being interrupted.\n\nI realize we're only hearing your side, and there's probably more to it.

From an activity that both of your parents would allow. Your mom isn\u2019t home, so stepfather takes the opportunity to make up rules on-the-spot to try and assert his dominance over you and try to undermine your mom\u2019s authority over HER child - knowing that if your mom WAS home, she\u2019d put a stop to his nonsense.\nStepfather is definitely TA. If he has a problem with your mom\u2019s rules for you - he needs to talk to HER about it first - not just try to play the \u201cI am the man of this house\u201d card.", "It might be easier to decide if we knew the ages of OP and the half-sister. I\u2019m guessing that OP is a teenager. If the half-sister is much younger (toddler, infant ), I could see the frustration. But if he screams about everything (some parents do), I can understand the attitude. I would address this with your mom.", "I say NTA.", "ESH him for how he handled it and you for speaking to him that way. Clearly when you are at their house it\u2019s normal to have some rules and expectations and he is part of the household and the father of your half sister. Also how much noise did you make coming home? Is it not normal to respect the sleep of your half sister. You really think threatening to not come home to your mother anymore is a good thing to do? And is that showing maturity? Because wanting to be treated like an adult comes with showing maturity not throwing tantrums\n\nI think you really to talk to your mom and stepdad and find a way to all get along.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are there common rules your Mom has agreed to which you are challenging? How old are you? Has your Mom said to him who is responsible for things like rebukes? Not enough to add a rating here", "ESH - Your post lacks in context but you definitely come across as difficult and bratty.", "NTA, OP. I'm also 41. And I actually think it's too easy to automatically stereotype teenagers as 'snotty' and 'defiant'. Sure, they can be. But these stereotypes are often a way to invalidate them, on occasions they actually have a point - by insinuating they are always 'deliberately' and 'unreasonably' defiant, because of their hormones/life stage. \n\nThey can be expected to have perfect adult 'maturity', when we wouldn't expect adults to never respond in an argument. Yhe same behaviour from adults, would be seen as standing up for themselves (or just normal human arguing). Ask yourself seriously - if this scenario played out identically (but OP was 30), would you refer to OP as 'defiant' and 'snotty'?\n\nWhat was OP supposed to do here? They did something their mother allows. An adult with no parental authority (over OP) then launched into OP about it, with unreasonable complaints about 'engine noise'. OP walked away, to avoid further argument. \n\n30 mins later, the same adult seeks out and confronts OP in OP's own space, trying to take their keys off them. Throughout, stepfather was overstepping his bounds; trying to dominate through anger and threats, etc. And trying to PUSH OP'S buttons, by trying to take the keys (and car access); impose a curfew OP wasn't actually expected to have by her mother; claim limitless authority over OP because it's the stepfather's house (though it's also OP's mother's), etc.\n\nSo what was OP supposed to do? Stand to attention and say 'yes sir!'? Or suggest they sit down and talk calmly about it, and get into family therapy? OP just defended themselves; called his bluff; etc. Comments that might 'push his buttons', were only a defense to inappropriate power plays the stepfather was trying to make.\n\nMost people would do that in an argument - yet it's only teenagers, who are condemned for it. The stepfather is supposed to be the adult, yet he was acting like a child. OP has the right to object.", "What you\u2019re saying has merit.  But reading the thread, it\u2019s clear the OP is an AH who is having issues at least in part from being from a broken home.  The mom is an AH for not setting good boundaries, and for not being willing to discipline.  And the stepdad is an AH for his hotheaded behavior.  ESH, except the half-sister (based on what\u2019s been given)."]}
