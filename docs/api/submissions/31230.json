Are there common rules your Mom has agreed to which you are challenging? How old are you? Has your Mom said to him who is responsible for things like rebukes? Not enough to add a rating here", "ESH - Your post lacks in context but you definitely come across as difficult and bratty.", "NTA, OP. I'm also 41. And I actually think it's too easy to automatically stereotype teenagers as 'snotty' and 'defiant'. Sure, they can be. But these stereotypes are often a way to invalidate them, on occasions they actually have a point - by insinuating they are always 'deliberately' and 'unreasonably' defiant, because of their hormones/life stage. \n\nThey can be expected to have perfect adult 'maturity', when we wouldn't expect adults to never respond in an argument. Yhe same behaviour from adults, would be seen as standing up for themselves (or just normal human arguing). Ask yourself seriously - if this scenario played out identically (but OP was 30), would you refer to OP as 'defiant' and 'snotty'?\n\nWhat was OP supposed to do here? They did something their mother allows. An adult with no parental authority (over OP) then launched into OP about it, with unreasonable complaints about 'engine noise'. OP walked away, to avoid further argument. \n\n30 mins later, the same adult seeks out and confronts OP in OP's own space, trying to take their keys off them. Throughout, stepfather was overstepping his bounds; trying to dominate through anger and threats, etc. And trying to PUSH OP'S buttons, by trying to take the keys (and car access); impose a curfew OP wasn't actually expected to have by her mother; claim limitless authority over OP because it's the stepfather's house (though it's also OP's mother's), etc.\n\nSo what was OP supposed to do? Stand to attention and say 'yes sir!'? Or suggest they sit down and talk calmly about it, and get into family therapy? OP just defended themselves; called his bluff; etc. Comments that might 'push his buttons', were only a defense to inappropriate power plays the stepfather was trying to make.\n\nMost people would do that in an argument - yet it's only teenagers, who are condemned for it. The stepfather is supposed to be the adult, yet he was acting like a child. OP has the right to object.", "What you\u2019re saying has merit.  But reading the thread, it\u2019s clear the OP is an AH who is having issues at least in part from being from a broken home.  The mom is an AH for not setting good boundaries, and for not being willing to discipline.  And the stepdad is an AH for his hotheaded behavior.  ESH, except the half-sister (based on what\u2019s been given).", "NTA. I am the dad of two young ladies who live week on week off between their mom\u2019s house and mine. My younger daughter despises the new guy because he is always in her grill. She does EXACTLY what you do to get him to back off. I encourage her standing up for herself as many have told me he goes out of his way to be a dick. I\u2019ve had run ins with him and he wouldn\u2019t dare overstep with me. He\u2019s been told to back off of my daughter or fuck around find out. \n\nFor reference, he\u2019s the guy that started banging my wife at work. Both my girls know why my marriage ended. Stick to your guns, your mom married him and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to like him.", "NTA.  Your mom and dad have the final say on parenting decisions.  That said; it doesn\u2019t mean you get to disrespect your mom\u2019s husband.  I would not have given him the keys but I would have told him if you have a problem with anything I have done you should take it up with my mother and father.  Threatening to make you move out plays right into your hands and pits your mother against her husband.  Not a great position for him but that\u2019s what he signed up for when he married a woman who already has a child (or children) with another man.  For your mom\u2019s sake I would try to get along with him but I would not let him bully you either.", "NTA - 9pm isn't even late and even if by chance your car did wake your sister up.

Also they\u2019re a minor of some kind if they did have a curfew/have to go to separate parent\u2019s houses. definitely bratty but I think it\u2019s deserved in my opinion. \n\nStep dad\u2019s reaction was too much and harsh, his yelling probably kept the sister up and who asks for their step kid\u2019s keys?

Stand up for yourself just be mindful, ya know?.", "NTA however I do think if your mum and her husband have different rules to your dad maybe you should respect those. The way you are describing your encounter with your mums husband lets me believe this is a regular occurrence. If you want to have a relationship with your sibling and your mum and her husband I would suggest a chat with your parents and your mums husband . This way you can speak directly about this issue which is bigger than coming back home late / not. I wish you all the best of luck in this.", "I don\u2019t understand the part where you say she wasn\u2019t happy you stayed on your own for a few days?

You come in late, you wake a child, you have no manners and you bait your stepfather because you know you can get away with it.
