I would never trust him. Is he only bothered because you have a boyfriend and not a girlfriend or did he know you were gay?", "I'm gonna go with NTA.  This is a huge thing that your Dad did, and he obviously hasn't earned your forgiveness or your trust.  He doesn't get to ask for the same just because he wants it now and didn't think you deserved it back then.  And he doesn't get to blab to other family members to try to get someone on his side.

No one will deny that it\u2019s a terrible thing to lose your wife and have to be the one who tells their kid their mom is gone - however, lying to your child for 3 weeks and telling them their mom will be home soon, when in reality she was dead the whole time, was absolutely the wrong way to handle it. I would also have trust issues if a parent did this to me. Was what you said a low blow? Sure, but he was the one who brought up trust and honesty, and he needs to understand that what he did to you was dishonest and ruined your ability to trust him. I hope he someday comes to that realization so you guys can heal and move on together.", "I have noticed that most people who post on here always end with something about family members all calling and texting to back up the person an OP is having an issue with. How do all these family members find out what happens in someone else's home? When I was a child we were always told that what is said at home, stays at home, which I thought meant our family discussions/issues were not to be discussed with everyone else. Seems like no one can keep anything to themselves nowadays. It's really no one else's business what goes on between you and your dad.\n\nWith that said, I'm very sorry for you losing your mom and your dad not telling you. It's bizarre. How did he have a funeral for her? I've never heard anything like this before. I don't blame you one bit for making the comment about him not being honest with you about your mom's death.\n\nI think you and your dad could benefit from some counseling. I think it will be hard for you both to go forward without some professional help. Wishing you all the best and again, so sorry for the loss of your mom.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and your family kept your mothers passing away from you for 3 weeks.\n\nI am guessing you never had the opportunity to go to her funeral as a result. \n\nYour trust in your father and family has been damaged and if you don't feel comfortable sharing news about your life with your dad he has to understand that his actions have consequences and if he wants to regain your trust he has to work at it.\n\nI have one question: Did your dad ever explain his reasoning for keeping it from you?", "This is horrendous. I'm so fucking sorry your dad pulled that shit. I cannot imagine the mess that would have made of my relationship with my mum if she had done the same. Lying to your child about their other parent dying is the most brutal, cowardly and unfair thing you can do. He had a choice to be honest with the child he bears full responsibility for about one of the worst things that can happen to us, and instead chose to protect himself and add a complete betrayal from one parent to the devastating loss of the other. Grief can make us do strange things, but we still have a responsibility to our kids whose entire world is shaped by us.\n\nOn the other hand, it is hardly unusual for a 17 year old to not tell their parents they have a boyfriend. We don't exactly live in a culture where young people are enabled to have healthy, happy sexual and romantic relationships with the full knowledge of their parents in most cases. \n\nNTA. Your father is a hypocrite and getting other family members to bombard you with texts is hardly grownup behaviour.", "Wait! You didn\u2019t attend her funeral? No other family members came to your house?", "take 3 weeks to reply to him", "NTA\n\nAnd ask your father why he is so insecure that he as a grown ass man needs to call in his flying monkeys for help to deal with a 17-year old. That's pretty pathetic.", "Did your father know you\u2019re gay, and was trying to be supportive? Also, being gay and saying you have a boyfriend/coming out is a big thing for you, it\u2019s not so much about him, but you. So I think if he was responding to you coming out (no context, so I\u2019m just assuming), it\u2019s an overreaction on his part, and he should consider your feelings more than his own feelings about not being in the know. You tell him when you\u2019re comfortable. \n\nAbout your mother, I\u2019m sorry to hear and it sounds like you are still not quite over the way he handled it. He definitely could have handled it a lot better. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t get to attend the funeral and say your goodbyes? That\u2019s really horrid. I would say have a talk to him about it and how it affected you. The trust issue is totally understandable. It\u2019s so traumatising to deal with loss. What\u2019s more in that way and at 11 years old. \n\nNot defending him. It sounds like he cares a great deal about you, but he\u2019s terrible at communicating and expressing it. You can both go for joint counselling if you are open to repairing your relationship with him.", "Nope! Cheap shot, but not the asshole. Not being told for almost a month that my mom had died would wreck me forever! What about the funeral to say good bye?", "I wanna believe dad just didn't know how to use his words from his own traumas, but really as much as it might explain the 3 week wait...it wasn't okay.   \nNTA but your dad is. If he wants a relationship with you, he needs to understand that trust takes years to rebuild. It didn't just magically fix over a few years.", "NTA, but both of you need therapy.", "NTA, his lie was absolutely horrific. If it was me, I would never trust him again.", "I m gonna say its half NTA and half YTA. \n\nI fully understand your frustration and lack of trust because of that and its wrong what he did. Your emotions about that enormous of betrail are valid and he has to accept that he hurt you immensly with that. \n\nBut from his perspective his life was in shambles and he lost the love of his life from one moment to the next which is difficult to handle even for an adult. And its easy to say that he should just pull it together and be there for you in that moment, but also remember that this means shouldering your grief to and pretending to be strong to help you through it, while he propably bearly held on to his own concious at that time. Making that stupid decision in that moment to regain himself so he could shoulder your grief too propably seemed like a good idea to him at the time. Doesnt mean that it wasnt a stupid mistake to do so or that he wouldnt regret it later. \n\nOn the side of you guys hopefully getting over this (if you wish for that). Have you ever had a genuine adult (on equal level) discussion about that time? One without any blame, but just two people talking about what they felt in that moment and how it affected each of you?  It propably would help both of you realise the others perspective and whats needed to overcome this. If you fear that you or him might take it too far you can ask a neutral 3rd person to mediate.", "I mean yeah it was shitty but so is not telling your child that their mom died so\u2026NTA", "NTA he F\u2019d up big time by not telling you about the loss of your mother for 3 weeks.

NTA", "NTA.\n\nI would tell your dad that you brought it up, because even though you try not to let it bother you, it STILL hurts. It still makes you mad when you think about it. It still upsets you to remember how he hid that from you, but he expects you to then be willing to be perfectly open and honest with him.\n\nThat involving other family members in this, doesn't make him look 'more right', it makes him look like a dick who can't say sorry for his past mistakes and how that has impacted your ability to trust him.\n\nLike, I'm sure you want to trust him. But it is pretty hard to trust someone if they never admit that hiding a big thing from you was the wrong call. If they don't acknowledge that, then how can you know going forward that they won't make the same mistake about something else?\n\nYou would like to believe him but the best indicator of future behaviour is past behaviour and his past behaviour was to hide the truth and lie to you.

I told him about 3 hours after it happened once I had,gotten home from the hospital. My son went to the funeral home to see his deceased dad with me and was present at his dad\u2019s massive funeral with over 400 people there.

Misguided and so very dumb, but still love.\n\nMy parents did something simular when I was 8. My great grandmother who was more of grandmother to me than my actual one was dying. She practically raised my mom and babysit me and my brother all the time, always gave us chocolate raisins. I loved her. But she was dying and she was suffering. So my mom and dad instead conspired to remove the kids from the equation. My dad took us on a trip to family in another country. They didn't tell us she was dying or when she died during the trip and the funeral was held. We found out month later that my grandma had died because that was how long it took for my mom to process all the grief and pain.\n\nIt sucked but it wasn't malicious and I do not hold it over her head for the rest of my life.

What he did was wrong. But you\u2019re trying to equate a man losing the love of his life and trying to find a way to tell his child that their mother is dead\u2026to you hiding a girlfriend. Lol. It\u2019s ok. You will grow up", "What is WRONG with all of you?? There do exist situations where *everyone* is wrong, which is why we have the ESH judgment on here. In this case, it not only applies to OP and his father, but to all of you saying N T A as well. \n\nWas OP's father right to not tell his son that his mom had died, for 3 weeks? No. Could we also recognize that the man had just lost someone he presumably loved and was also trying to accept being a single father AND breaking the news to his 11yo son? Yeah, have some empathy while also recognizing that he probably did not make the right choice. I will also say we don't know what happened in that hospital room between father and mother. People sometimes make ludicrous deathbed requests. Regardless, Dad was wrong.\n\nWas it acceptable that OP used something he knew would hurt his dad in an argument, intentionally and knowing how much it would hurt his father? NO, IT IS ALSO NOT OKAY. There are a million other replies he could have had, but he picked his mom's death. Gosh I'm disappointed in everyone. Are we really people who just say that hurting others is justifiable for pathetic reasons? There may be situations where OP would NOT be the AH such as if Dad said \"your mom would be disappointed in you, didn't she always tell you not to keep secrets?\" At which point OP would reply \"You're the one who didn't even tell me she died so don't bring her up.\" And yes, people say hurtful things during arguments. But THEN they recognize that what they did was hurtful and move on together.\n\nI love how people are 1) telling OP to run and NC once he's 18. 2) assuming Dad is mad because OP is gay, and not *gasp* just hurt that he feels like OP is blocking him from his life. I'm convinced all the posters so far are angry 17yos who wish someone would justify theit bad behavior too.", "First of, OP. I'm sending love your way. Losing a parent is never easy, and your resentment at your dad is valid as well. \n\nThere are no assholes in this situation - just people who need to help each other overcome their trauma.

Just watching them get more and more excited that mom is coming home knowing that she never will be? \n\nOP\u2019s father has no justifiable defense for doing that to a child and that you think he does is very concerning. Do you frequently think it\u2019s ok to lie about significant events to people?", "The child missed his mother's funeral and he should just act as if nothing happened??", "Did the Dad find this post, cuz.......", "OP is 17. Buy a clue dude.", "> \u201c<LovedOne> wronged you? Never speak to them again! Break up/ go NC/ nothing you can do is wrong!\u201d\n\nI'd agree with your point if \"wronged you\" meant \"ate the half-sandwich you were saving for later in the fridge,\" but \"lied about the death of your parent by stringing you along telling you she'd be home soon?\"\n\nMaybe it was just a grief-borne epic mistake, but actions--mistakes or not--have consequences, and OP's trust in him is still clearly broken.", "> this very small snippet.\n\nI'd say lying about the death of their mom is a lot bigger than a small snippet but sure.", "A small snippet that probably defined their relationship and hurt OP tremendously. But yeah it's just a small thing.", "I\u2019m sorry but lying to your child about their mother\u2019s death? Yeah that is unforgivable. How dare he ever expect that his son should tell him anything! He broke the trust when he lied to his child about his mom dying.", "Wow you are soooo superior.   Everybody clap for this redditor for being soooo much better than the rest of us.", "You think lying to a kid about their mum's death is small? Hope you don't have kids.\n\nThinking about it, sounds like you do and they don't talk to you.", "\nYour response makes sense, if you ignore 2 things \u2014  \n1) The commenter didn\u2019t tell OP to do anything, they were speculating about the future of this family relationship.  \n2) Context is a thing, and we actually do have some context here. The fact that Dad lied about OP\u2019s mom being dead for 3 entire weeks, and and even now \u2014 having been confronted with the fact that this is (as it would be) still weighing on OP and causing a rift in the relationship \u2014 still refuses to capitulate or face their guilt in any way . . . yeah, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this leads to a low/no contact situation either.", "There is no such thing as disagreements on here, only relationship ending arguments that will forever ruin OPs support systems.", "Agreed", "OP didn\u2019t cut his mother out, she fucking died bro. And because dad dealt with it in the shittiest way possible, OP no longer trusts him.", "His*", "You\u2019re assuming things. For all you know OP\u2019s dad could have just been venting or asking for advice", "Unbelievable lack of emotional intelligence there", "LOL ARE YOU KIDDING? It's not that hard? Have you ever had to do it? The widows I know say it's the hardest thing they've ever done.", "Thank you. I think your method is way better for the grieving process", "Only reason i didnt vote e sh is because op\nIs asking specifically if they are wrong for what they just did.\n\nWhich essentially boild down to\n\n\nDad: hey ip wish you would have told be you were dating. Its inportant we stay honest with each other\n\nOp: tell that to your dead wife!!!!!\n\n\nWhich somehow in true aita fashion the whole sub ignored cause they fixated on background information", "apologising and making amends only works when the other party actually accepts the apology\u2026 op says he\u2019s found it really heard to trust his dad since he was *11 yrs old* and is still angry, which i really don\u2019t think is normal for a person who\u2019s made their peace with someone and has a healthy family dynamic. we don\u2019t know what happened in those six years. there\u2019s no esh or yta or nah etc etc because history matters, and i can\u2019t judge op or his father\u2019s actions based off this one argument. \n\ni\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t. but this is my comment so i felt like pointing it out. \ud83d\udc80", "OP is male, and I think it\u2019s pretty obvious why a teen would keep a same-sex relationship a secret from a parent they couldn\u2019t trust.", "The fact that OP's dad's reaction to their fight was to go tell their relatives about it to get them on his side isn't a good look and indicates he hasn't learned much in the past six years. \n\nOn top of that, an initial lie about the mother's death wouldn't have been great, but he kept on lying about it for three weeks, including coming up with new lies after the first two weeks.", "Nope. He made his son wait three weeks for a mom that would never come home.. he doesn't get a pass. You realise how messed up that is ?", " fuck that. He's the dad, he should be there for the child not make excuses. I get that he was mourning and he has my sympathy but you can't have your child miss their own parent's funeral, that's messed up. \n\nI just keep thinking about little op waiting for the mother that never came home and it breaks my heart and it definitely broke the trust op had in his dad and trust is important when coming out to a parent ( it's a boyfriend not a girlfriend)", "I\u2019m not as sympathetic to the \u201che did t know how to tell you\u201d argument. Presumably the hospital where OP\u2019s mother was treated and OP\u2019s school both had counselors on staff who could have helped him in that. It\u2019s a difficult thing to tell your kid, but lying was not the answer and there were resources he could have used to help him in this.", "My point is that you\u2019re saying OP misunderstood his fathers intentions, I\u2019m saying that doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter that the father wasn\u2019t trying to be vindictive, his actions hurt his son and there are consequences. One of those consequences is clearly that his son doesn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing big events in his life.  If his father wants that to change it\u2019s on him to apologize to his son.", "You're the least intelligent and empathetic redditor I have had displeasure to come across. Losing a wife will never mean more than losing a loving parent. People remarry new spouses all the time and some even forget they ever loved a person before while a child who lost his mother at a young age will bear this title till they die. You should really get off the internet and not share your opinion with anyone till you grow some common sense.", "It was the OP\u2019s mother. You don\u2019t think losing your mom at a young age was devastating? His father may have been grieving & at a loss of how to tell him but his lies made her loss more traumatizing to the OP.  That lie will scar him for the rest of his life and he probably will never fully trust his father. Also OP is a male so admitting he has a boyfriend comes with a whole slew of issues. Does his dad know he is gay/bi? Will he be accepting? Is he ready to come out? It is not as simple as saying hey I am dating someone.", "you didn't read it with very much comprehension because if you had you would know that I'm his son not his daughter lol", "He wasn't dishonest, he just didn't think something like that needs to be shared with a person who has no regard for him. The dad destroyed their relationship for nothing really and now he's reaping what he has sown. You're saying that as if his mother didn't die and it was some random person to OP and only the father lost a loved one. It was some evil stepmother that died, it was OP's actual mother. You seem to have missed that.", "I know, it's a typo, but please don't change it!", "Cats really are tiny blenders.  Terrible what they can do to a human body.", "Where did I say that?", "Good one, but not everything is black and white", "Yeah,  17 not a child or mentally handicapped dude.", "17 years old is old enough to be informed her behavior isn\u2019t cool.

Some reading comprehension could be useful for you", "To be fair, \"you didn't tell me mom was dead for 3 weeks\" genuinely qualifies as a good reason to end a relationship with your parent.", "Yes, his mom died, and yes, his father handled it badly. That doesn\u2019t mean a random internet poster recommending he cut out the remaining parent in his life isn\u2019t an absurd comment.", "Good catch, fixed", "When you lose your spouse and you have to tell your small child their mom (or dad) is dead\u2026get back to me.

But you do you boo.", "Of course intent is important , ever heard of manslaughter or murder, big difference.\nI never said his father was not wrong.\nI firmly believe his father should talk about it and apologise. But let's be clear here. The OP only said he didn't tell his dad about his relationship, no mention of him not saying anything  because of what his father did. OP led us to believe that basically when dad asked him why he didn't tell him, Op used what his dad did to throw it back at him. So Op is YTA for using it vindictively. Anyway we are not supposed to be debating between ourselves. AITA Is about opinions. not whether  commentators opinions are correct or not.", "You must be a teen. That is not what i said at all. You are acting as if the father didnt lise a thing that day.", "OMG \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Nor did I say it was.

It's a major event.", "Question, at what age is someone no longer a small child in your eyes? Because OP was 11 when his mom died and to me at least an 11 year old should be perfectly capable of understanding death.", "What about making the child miss their own mother\u2019s funeral? After all, for most of the world, three weeks means missing funeral arrangements.", "Nobody is acting as if OP\u2019s dad didn\u2019t lose a loved one. But it is fucked up to lie to your kid and continually tell him that his mom is coming home when you know she\u2019s not. It may have been his own grief that caused him to lie to his son, but that doesn\u2019t excuse the harm he caused. If he didn\u2019t feel up to telling his son the day it happened, he should have asked a family member, family friend, hospital employee, or school counselor to tell him instead. Nobody made OP\u2019s dad lie to him, and however much pain and anguish he was feeling in the moment doesn\u2019t make it okay that he did that.", "No, i'm middle aged just not an idiot. That's exactly what you said. I said that both lost someone that day and should have been together in this but the father chose to make an extremely stupid decision and thus not only lost his wife that day but also his son.", "[removed]", "It\u2019s not about understanding death it\u2019s about the parent\u2019s ability to explain.

As a parent you need to be willing to put your children ahead of your own emotions when necessary. If you\u2019re not capable of that then you are not a good parent, and you should not be having children. If you\u2019re not able to explain major life events to your child then you are not emotionally regulated enough to have one.", "No, absolutely wrong on all counts. That's what being a parent is about - doing the hard things, even the tragic things, for the benefit of your child. Grief does things to you, but it does not remove the fact that you are being selfish, even cruel, to deny your child a final goodbye to their mother, like OP's father did. If you are not strong enough to do that as a parent, then you need to be strong enough to at least apologize that you lied and know you have broken trust with your child, and actual put in work to rebuild that trust.\n\nAs a father, it should never be all about you, even in grief. And that's what OP's father did - made it all about him, at the awful expense of his child.\n\nAlso, it's clear you only care about the feelings of the father who lost his spouse. What about OP, who lost his mother? The father got to say goodbye to his wife, but did OP get the opportunity to say goodbye to his mother? Not knowing how to say that to your child is not an excuse. I'm absoutely going to judge a parent for unrepentantly damaging their child, as should anyone with common sense.\n\nOf course, you're much too superior to everyone else here, since it's clear you don't actually care about the child in this situation. I guess the magnitudes of OP's pain don't matter, because *what* about the poor grieving dad? I suppose losing your mother, never seeing her again, and being lied to by your father simply pale in comparison to the father's overwhelming grief./s\n\nBy the way, lying about having a girlfriend is nowhere near the realm of lying about your mother dying. Obviously. You should be embarrassed.", "Bruh. Ops dad literally made op wait for his dead mother to come home for weeks. It's inexcusable. \n\nImagine it... Little op waiting for mom to come home from her trip for weeks... Nope shes dead, has been for three days, he missed the funeral all cause daddy was selfish."]}
