This is a huge thing that your Dad did, and he obviously hasn't earned your forgiveness or your trust.  He doesn't get to ask for the same just because he wants it now and didn't think you deserved it back then.  And he doesn't get to blab to other family members to try to get someone on his side.

No one will deny that it\u2019s a terrible thing to lose your wife and have to be the one who tells their kid their mom is gone - however, lying to your child for 3 weeks and telling them their mom will be home soon, when in reality she was dead the whole time, was absolutely the wrong way to handle it. I would also have trust issues if a parent did this to me. Was what you said a low blow? Sure, but he was the one who brought up trust and honesty, and he needs to understand that what he did to you was dishonest and ruined your ability to trust him. I hope he someday comes to that realization so you guys can heal and move on together.", "I have noticed that most people who post on here always end with something about family members all calling and texting to back up the person an OP is having an issue with. How do all these family members find out what happens in someone else's home? When I was a child we were always told that what is said at home, stays at home, which I thought meant our family discussions/issues were not to be discussed with everyone else. Seems like no one can keep anything to themselves nowadays. It's really no one else's business what goes on between you and your dad.\n\nWith that said, I'm very sorry for you losing your mom and your dad not telling you. It's bizarre. How did he have a funeral for her? I've never heard anything like this before. I don't blame you one bit for making the comment about him not being honest with you about your mom's death.\n\nI think you and your dad could benefit from some counseling. I think it will be hard for you both to go forward without some professional help. Wishing you all the best and again, so sorry for the loss of your mom.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and your family kept your mothers passing away from you for 3 weeks.\n\nI am guessing you never had the opportunity to go to her funeral as a result. \n\nYour trust in your father and family has been damaged and if you don't feel comfortable sharing news about your life with your dad he has to understand that his actions have consequences and if he wants to regain your trust he has to work at it.\n\nI have one question: Did your dad ever explain his reasoning for keeping it from you?", "This is horrendous. I'm so fucking sorry your dad pulled that shit. I cannot imagine the mess that would have made of my relationship with my mum if she had done the same. Lying to your child about their other parent dying is the most brutal, cowardly and unfair thing you can do. He had a choice to be honest with the child he bears full responsibility for about one of the worst things that can happen to us, and instead chose to protect himself and add a complete betrayal from one parent to the devastating loss of the other. Grief can make us do strange things, but we still have a responsibility to our kids whose entire world is shaped by us.\n\nOn the other hand, it is hardly unusual for a 17 year old to not tell their parents they have a boyfriend. We don't exactly live in a culture where young people are enabled to have healthy, happy sexual and romantic relationships with the full knowledge of their parents in most cases. \n\nNTA. Your father is a hypocrite and getting other family members to bombard you with texts is hardly grownup behaviour.", "Wait! You didn\u2019t attend her funeral? No other family members came to your house?", "take 3 weeks to reply to him", "NTA\n\nAnd ask your father why he is so insecure that he as a grown ass man needs to call in his flying monkeys for help to deal with a 17-year old. That's pretty pathetic.", "Did your father know you\u2019re gay, and was trying to be supportive? Also, being gay and saying you have a boyfriend/coming out is a big thing for you, it\u2019s not so much about him, but you. So I think if he was responding to you coming out (no context, so I\u2019m just assuming), it\u2019s an overreaction on his part, and he should consider your feelings more than his own feelings about not being in the know. You tell him when you\u2019re comfortable. \n\nAbout your mother, I\u2019m sorry to hear and it sounds like you are still not quite over the way he handled it. He definitely could have handled it a lot better. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t get to attend the funeral and say your goodbyes? That\u2019s really horrid. I would say have a talk to him about it and how it affected you. The trust issue is totally understandable. It\u2019s so traumatising to deal with loss. What\u2019s more in that way and at 11 years old. \n\nNot defending him. It sounds like he cares a great deal about you, but he\u2019s terrible at communicating and expressing it. You can both go for joint counselling if you are open to repairing your relationship with him.", "Nope! Cheap shot, but not the asshole. Not being told for almost a month that my mom had died would wreck me forever! What about the funeral to say good bye?", "I wanna believe dad just didn't know how to use his words from his own traumas, but really as much as it might explain the 3 week wait...it wasn't okay.   \nNTA but your dad is. If he wants a relationship with you, he needs to understand that trust takes years to rebuild. It didn't just magically fix over a few years.", "NTA, but both of you need therapy.", "NTA, his lie was absolutely horrific. If it was me, I would never trust him again.", "I m gonna say its half NTA and half YTA. \n\nI fully understand your frustration and lack of trust because of that and its wrong what he did. Your emotions about that enormous of betrail are valid and he has to accept that he hurt you immensly with that. \n\nBut from his perspective his life was in shambles and he lost the love of his life from one moment to the next which is difficult to handle even for an adult. And its easy to say that he should just pull it together and be there for you in that moment, but also remember that this means shouldering your grief to and pretending to be strong to help you through it, while he propably bearly held on to his own concious at that time. Making that stupid decision in that moment to regain himself so he could shoulder your grief too propably seemed like a good idea to him at the time. Doesnt mean that it wasnt a stupid mistake to do so or that he wouldnt regret it later. \n\nOn the side of you guys hopefully getting over this (if you wish for that). Have you ever had a genuine adult (on equal level) discussion about that time? One without any blame, but just two people talking about what they felt in that moment and how it affected each of you?  It propably would help both of you realise the others perspective and whats needed to overcome this. If you fear that you or him might take it too far you can ask a neutral 3rd person to mediate.", "I mean yeah it was shitty but so is not telling your child that their mom died so\u2026NTA", "NTA he F\u2019d up big time by not telling you about the loss of your mother for 3 weeks.

NTA", "NTA.\n\nI would tell your dad that you brought it up, because even though you try not to let it bother you, it STILL hurts. It still makes you mad when you think about it. It still upsets you to remember how he hid that from you, but he expects you to then be willing to be perfectly open and honest with him.\n\nThat involving other family members in this, doesn't make him look 'more right', it makes him look like a dick who can't say sorry for his past mistakes and how that has impacted your ability to trust him.\n\nLike, I'm sure you want to trust him. But it is pretty hard to trust someone if they never admit that hiding a big thing from you was the wrong call. If they don't acknowledge that, then how can you know going forward that they won't make the same mistake about something else?\n\nYou would like to believe him but the best indicator of future behaviour is past behaviour and his past behaviour was to hide the truth and lie to you.

I told him about 3 hours after it happened once I had,gotten home from the hospital. My son went to the funeral home to see his deceased dad with me and was present at his dad\u2019s massive funeral with over 400 people there.

Misguided and so very dumb, but still love.\n\nMy parents did something simular when I was 8. My great grandmother who was more of grandmother to me than my actual one was dying. She practically raised my mom and babysit me and my brother all the time, always gave us chocolate raisins. I loved her. But she was dying and she was suffering. So my mom and dad instead conspired to remove the kids from the equation. My dad took us on a trip to family in another country. They didn't tell us she was dying or when she died during the trip and the funeral was held. We found out month later that my grandma had died because that was how long it took for my mom to process all the grief and pain.\n\nIt sucked but it wasn't malicious and I do not hold it over her head for the rest of my life. You only have one parents and you will regret it if you let this define and rule your relationship with him. And what you said was understandable but still cruel.", "YTA. Listen I get it. What he did was wrong. But you\u2019re trying to equate a man losing the love of his life and trying to find a way to tell his child that their mother is dead\u2026to you hiding a girlfriend. Lol. It\u2019s ok. You will grow up", "What is WRONG with all of you?? There do exist situations where *everyone* is wrong, which is why we have the ESH judgment on here. In this case, it not only applies to OP and his father, but to all of you saying N T A as well. \n\nWas OP's father right to not tell his son that his mom had died, for 3 weeks? No. Could we also recognize that the man had just lost someone he presumably loved and was also trying to accept being a single father AND breaking the news to his 11yo son? Yeah, have some empathy while also recognizing that he probably did not make the right choice. I will also say we don't know what happened in that hospital room between father and mother. People sometimes make ludicrous deathbed requests. Regardless, Dad was wrong.\n\nWas it acceptable that OP used something he knew would hurt his dad in an argument, intentionally and knowing how much it would hurt his father? NO, IT IS ALSO NOT OKAY. There are a million other replies he could have had, but he picked his mom's death. Gosh I'm disappointed in everyone. Are we really people who just say that hurting others is justifiable for pathetic reasons? There may be situations where OP would NOT be the AH such as if Dad said \"your mom would be disappointed in you, didn't she always tell you not to keep secrets?\" At which point OP would reply \"You're the one who didn't even tell me she died so don't bring her up.\" And yes, people say hurtful things during arguments. But THEN they recognize that what they did was hurtful and move on together.\n\nI love how people are 1) telling OP to run and NC once he's 18. 2) assuming Dad is mad because OP is gay, and not *gasp* just hurt that he feels like OP is blocking him from his life. I'm convinced all the posters so far are angry 17yos who wish someone would justify theit bad behavior too.", "First of, OP. I'm sending love your way. Losing a parent is never easy, and your resentment at your dad is valid as well. \n\nThere are no assholes in this situation - just people who need to help each other overcome their trauma.

Ask him why he lied to you, and you will find out that he was probably trying to protect you.\n\nHe may have gone about it the wrong way, but he did what he thought was right for you. \n\nSpeak to him, and you will realize that he meant no harm when he lied.

He was in shock, bereaved, etc. He shouldn't have lied to you, but there's no widely accepted way to tell a child her mother was killed.", "YTA because I think you mis understood your dad's intentions.\nYou have to think about the trauma he went through with your mum passing, but he also wanted to protect you and save you from grief. Clearly he was not thinking straight. Any action born out of a desire to protect is not vindictive.\nYou choose to not tell your dad about your boyfriend. Why was that?.

He hypocritically insisted that you tell him all major events in your life, even when he refuses to do the same. \n3. When you called him out, he sicced flying monkeys against you. \n4. He never apologized for anything, nor acknowledged how his actions hurt you. \n\nYour mother would be rolling in her grave at how your father is treating you. His behavior is absolutely vile and inexcusable. \n\nMy advice to you is to begin preparing to leave the house when you turn 18. Start saving up if you haven't already. Reach out to friends to see if one of them will let you live with them.

I'm sorry you lost your mom.", "NTA OP your dad should have pulled you out of school to be at her bedside if it were possible to do so in time. Not telling you for 3 weeks is absolutely gutless of him, especially awful to string you along like that. You were 10y not 2y. And fully capable of understanding. What did he do about her funeral?

You've matured now enough to hold him to account as an adult. \n\nThat came out in the moment because you clearly still resent him for it, try and express in a more measured way again. He fucked up big time and he needs to own that. You could maybe apologise for HOW you said it but not what you said just to get the ball rolling and then talk about the real issue. \n\nIt kind of sucks but it works as a method for resolving conflict when one side has a lot more to make up for.

Dad may never earn that trust back and Dad needs to become ok with that. OP did nothing wrong here.

This is probably the easier reasoning to use then.\n\n Who knows what he said to the family. I'd respond with \"I expected better from you guys, it's rather disrespectful to jump to conclusions and attack people that you call family. My father asked me what broke my trust in him and I was honest with him, but he didn't like our heart to heart and didn't accept that him hiding my mother's death and lying about it affected me negatively and made me lose trust in him (which I can't control). The fact that he has shared this private conversation and has people attacking me for trying to be honest with him, just shows me that this family cares more about the image of family rather than being a family. Please focus on your own drama, as this has only made me lose respect in you as a \"family member\" since you couldn't even have the respect to ask me about this situation before assuming like an ass.\"", "Yeah, that's what i was thinking as well, in my country it's usual for the funeral take place in 5-7 days.

You absolutely have every right to throw that in his face when he is asking you to tell him important things.

What a thing to happen to an 11 year old without your dad's BS. He needed to hear that and your other relatives are wrong to call you selfish. You have done nothing wrong here, just used his own logic against him which he didn't like because he knows what he did was wrong. You've got no reason to be sorry because what he did was wrong, cruel and selfish. If you haven't discussed it, do. Tell him exactly how it made you feel and how you now view him.

Wanted to say so b/c when someone talks this kind of sense I so often see replies saying \"you're not in the wrong, you don't have to\" etc. Not saying there's no such thing as pushing someone to be \"the bigger person\" when in fact they're the victim here and should be supported--for sure that happens and never should--but we bring out that interpretation sometimes when it's not needed. Not giving an inch is the right approach with awful people, but treating decent flawed people who've screwed up and are being defensive like they're awful people tends to backfire for everybody and block reconciliation that could actually have happened and been authentic & good.\n\nI really like the way you explained it--to get the ball rolling. Apologizing for what you can reasonably apologize for (like how you said it) isn't giving in, it's showing the other person you care and are willing to bend a bit... you're not in an attacking posture, basically. If behind the defensiveness they're feeling awful about what they did, that opens up a space in which they feel like they can say so and you might get the genuine apology you need.\n\nHonestly it's a lot to ask of a 17yo and I definitely don't blame OP if he can't bring himself to do it--he knows his dad and I don't. But it's definitely worth considering.", "I was wondering this as well, Since it was 3 weeks. Im guessing OP did... :(", "I think all they meant was that OP has more options open to them once they turn 18. It can give a sense of hope for some young people who feel like they have zero control.

OP is NTA and owes Dad nothing, especially trust.  Dad managed to go about 3 weeks without showing any kind of emotion that could give OP the idea something was wrong.  And it's not like Dad was just sitting around going through the motions of every day life while ostensibly gathering the courage to say something.  He spent time planning and attending a funeral, which usually involves some type of family gathering afterwards, while specifically going out of his way to make sure OP noticed nothing.  That is so beyond fucked up.", "Right?!?!? I don't understand any of the e s h votes", " I don't think that any apology would have cut it, and I don't think the father truly gets it anyway if he lectures his about full disclosure now.\n\nI can get with the idea that he found it hard to believe his wife was dead, and avoided telling his son because it would make it somehow more real, and his focus would have to shift to his son instead of his own feelings of grief. \n\nWhatever he was actually thinking or feeling,  he avoided the reality of the situation with regard to his son, and let his son bear the brunt of his avoidant strategy. *Nothing's going to set that right.*", "OP's father refuses to talk to his son about his mother's funeral but you think he apologized?

I had no need to see my dad\u2019s body inside a coffin to get closure and I assumed most people would feel the same way. I didn\u2019t need to see him because I was there holding his hand when he died and I felt the moment his soul/spirit/mind/whatever you believe in left his body. I also knew he was dying for a couple of days before that, so I think my mind was preparing for it.\n\nThen my cousin died suddenly in a car accident a few years ago and I discovered that sudden, unexpected death was a whole different animal for me. I just *could not* process that he was gone. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but it was like I was waiting for someone to tell me it was a sick joke and my emotions would not settle on the idea that he was dead. The dam only broke when I saw him in the coffin. I needed to SEE him and say goodbye in person in order to grieve.\n\nAlso (apologies because this part is morbid), the accident was really bad and the mortuary had to use a lot of putty and strategic placement to conceal the damage.

And it doesn't need to be a negative experience honestly that I bring something up. If someone contradicts themselves I tell them. That's why I can relate that much because I do it a lot since people contradict themselves all the time. It is not only about hypocrisy, it is... I can not tell enough, I am German, I can not shut my mouth if something is inaccurate or illogical or contradictory. When I said they tell me I would never forgive it was just adding in reference when it's about shaming me.\n\nFunny was a friend who often asked: \"when did I say that?!\" And I showed him because he said it in MSN (yes, long, long ago) or in e-mail until he became really angry that he hates I log everything (I did for inspiration) because it is like he can never take back what he said. I laughed. Don't ask then? Ntm. it makes no difference about that since I remember in the first place, I just can not prove it then and being angry about a proof is kinda poor.
