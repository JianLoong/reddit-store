{"id": 25625, "submission_id": "162oq2d", "title": "AITA for being a bridesman to a close friend at her wedding even though my girlfriend was asked not to come?", "selftext": "A very close friend of mine since college got married recently. She and I have been friends since freshman year of college and since we work in the same field in the same city we've remained pretty close. We'll call her Tina. I started dating my GF Alex a year and a half ago. They DO NOT get along. So I can't pinpoint exactly why they don't.  Alex always says she just doesn't like Tina. Tina typically is just responding to Alex's energy. I don't try to get them to be besties, but I just want for them to get along because they both are very important to me. \n\nSo when Tina got engaged and she told me that she wanted me to be in her wedding which I was incredibly excited to do this for her. It however was difficult for me to make a decision as to whether or not to do this because Tina told me she wasn't fully comfortable with Alex coming. Which I guess makes sense, since they don't like each other. However I personally didn't feel like I had a dog in this fight. Their beef is theirs, not mine and I don't see why I should be limited in my relationships with either of them.\n\nI told Alex I wanted to go and she was apprehensive. She said that if Tina didn't want her to go, she didn't think I should go. I said I didn't think it was fair for her to say that. This is a huge event for Tina and she really wants me there and I really want to go and she really wants me there. I also said that there are friends of Alex I don't get along with and I don't stop her from seeing them. Alex eventually relented and said that she didn't care if I went or not. Months go by and the wedding happens and Tina's wedding comes up, at this point it's too late for me to just quit last minute and Alex again tells me that she doesn't want me to go. \n\nThis is like a week out of the wedding. I told her I couldn't flake last minute like that and I went to the wedding and had a good time. Now, Alex is telling me that I'm a huge dick and that I care about Tina's feelings more than hers. Now she's pissed at me when she gave me the go ahead to attend the wedding without her.", "created_utc": 1693138132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162oq2d/aita_for_being_a_bridesman_to_a_close_friend_at/", "score": 962, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seriously? And don\u2019t cop out by saying it\u2019s their beef and you\u2019re staying out of it. \n\n\u201c\u2026I personally didn\u2019t feel like I had a dog in this fight.\u201d  Uhh, yeah, you do. Stop being so milquetoast. You will wind up losing your relationship with Alex. Maybe you just don\u2019t care?\n\nYTA.", "> Alex eventually relented and said that she didn't care if I went or not.\n\nYou cannot be that oblivious. No woman has ever meant that.", "YTA.  Are you sure there isn't something more to this story?  I can't imagine on what planet Alex wouldn't be invited even if she isn't Tina's favorite person.  Like did she un-alive her cat or something?!?!?  Tina sounds very small and petty.\n\nAnd yes, you do appear to care about Tina's feelings more than Alex's.", "When your partner and your close friend don\u2019t get along, you definitely need to figure out why (not stick your head in the sand, sweep it under the rug  \u201cI can\u2019t pinpoint\u2026\u201d stuff)", "YTA\n\nOnce Alex was specifically excluded she shouldn\u2019t have had to tell you that you shouldn\u2019t go if you valued her as a girlfriend, it should be basic knowledge for someone in a relationship.\n\nWell, she had to tell you because you mentioned you wanted to go, and you didn\u2019t take the hint and argued your way into her relenting. Now that the event is close, it\u2019s no surprise her feelings have resurfaced and you have no grounds to hide behind the \u201cshe gave the go ahead\u201d because she told you her true feelings and you argued her into conceding. She probably mistakenly hoped that time would make you come to your senses.\n\nShe should be breaking up with you soon, most girlfriends would. \n\nP.S. I\u2019m not surprised Tina and you are great friends, because she showed her true colors. Nobody likes every partner their family and friends ends up with, but they just suck it up and deal with those partners when they have to, they don\u2019t pull classless moves like excluding your GF.", "YTA - It is normal for partners of people in the wedding party to be invited. Your girlfriend must feel horrible to be excluded like that. I would not even be friends with somebody who so openly expresses their disapproval of my partner. I can fully understand that your girlfriend is uncomfortable for you being friends with this person and you chose her over your girlfriend which is another slap in the face.", "It feels like there is probably something deeper going on here, but for the sake of simplifying it, YTA.\n\nChoosing a friend over a partner is always going to cause trouble. They shouldn't be remotely on the same level, and I'm guessing everyone will catch that you blame 'Alex's energy ' on why they don't get along. \n\nI'd consider this a significant betrayal, and Tina isn't innocent either. Sure, we all want to have the 'perfect' wedding day, but it shouldn't come at the expense of one of our best friends. If I'm Alex, I'm calling it a day on this one.", "YTA but you will find that you will be unlikely to mend the damage to your relationship with Alex, she will always remember that you picked Tina over her (and Tina is being an AH for not inviting your partner- I mean really?!). Alex is understandably hurt and you are prioritising your fun day over her.\n\nEdit - AND it was obvious that Alex did not want you to go, and was hoping that you would choose her of your own accord without her having to push you into it. Instead you heard what you wanted to hear - that she was giving you her blessing - rather than what she was actually saying. Relationship 101.", "YTA and I doubt you'll need to worry about your GF for much longer.", "YTA you're choosing your friend over your partner. You need to find out what the issue is so you can actually take a stance rather than I'm just not getting involved. Perhaps Tina's been really rude/disrespectful to Alex and that's why Alex doesn't like her/has attitude.\n\nAlso intrigued what you would do were you to end up marrying your gf, because there's no way she's going to want Tina at her wedding so would you choose your partner or your friend again??", "If you marry your gf, then Tina most definitely is not coming. Don't even ask.", "YTA for prioritizing your friendship with Tina over Alex.  It was out of line for you to be IN the wedding and then not allowed to bring Alex as your guest.", "INFO: Why doesn\u2019t Alex like Tina? I doubt it\u2019s \u201cfor no reason.\u201d", "YTA\n\nTina is a shitty friend and you\u2019re a shitty boyfriend. I can\u2019t imagine not inviting my friend\u2019s partner to my event. I don\u2019t absolutely love some of them but as long as my friends choose to be with them I can be decent.", "Info: \n\nHave you ever had a conversation with Alex on why she doesn\u2019t like Tina? \n\nHave you and Tina ever hooked up? \n\nDo you realize that if you and Alex ever get married, that Tina is not going to be invited? Are you ok with that?", "INFO - I feel like there's something being left out...  Has Alex really been the instigator in every conflict between her and Tina?  If so, then she has no right to be shocked when she's not invited to Tina's wedding.  And it's kinda toxic of her to expect you to abandon a close friend because she antagonizes them.\n\nI'm tired of the comments saying you should always choose your partner over friends- NO! NOT ALWAYS!\nAny partner that MAKES YOU choose between them and a close friend is toxic and unhealthy.", "YTA their beef will only get worse because of this and you obviously made a choice. Tina shouldn't have asked this from you and you should've told her that when you did.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t fight Tina to have Alex attend? It\u2019s a freaking dinner where she might have to say hi to her and then she would be so busy with everyone else at the wedding. \n\nNot a dog in this fight?! You literally have your SO in this fight which would make it your fight too. \n\nYour a big AH. Seriously Alex should leave you if this is how you think. You owe her a huge apology and if you want any kind of future, you should pull back from Tina. And don\u2019t be surprised when Tina doesn\u2019t like your other girl friends and they don\u2019t like her. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone who was a groom\u2019s woman in my best friends wedding. My buddy is important to me so I bent over backwards to make sure his girlfriend/wife felt comfortable with me and not find me a threat. And guess what, I am still best friends with him and now his wife.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t feel like you had a dog in this fight? How invested in this relationship are you? After a year and a half you should be to the point where you are in you are on your girlfriend\u2019s \u201cside.\u201d Unless you believe that they hate each other so badly that one or both would cause a scene at the wedding, which from the information you provided doesn\u2019t look like a concern.", "YTA for agreeing to be in a wedding that your GF is barred from, but YWBTA if you dropped out this late in the game.  \n\nGood luck, AH!  You really stepped in it this time, and I really hope that \u201cTina\u201d is a great friend worthy of ruining your relationship over.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA. If you plan on being with Alex long-term, her feelings should matter to you. You're essentially telling her that your friend is more important to you. Someone \"finally relenting\" to something means they just got tired of trying to make you understand their position.", "How could you not see that one coming...\n\nESH - youre tah a bit because you didnt solve the issue with Alex. She clearly was not ok with it and I personally wouldnt have gone without getting the OK from Alex because thats my partner. I also would have gotten invested in the conflict because of couse it concerns you as demonstrated. Youre not escaping it by ignoring it.\n\nAlex is tah because while she obviously had issues with it, she disgregarded them herself and still expected you to read the room instead of communicating clearly. She also never came around to clarify why she didnt want you to go.\n\nAnd Tina is TAH for inviting just one person of a pair to a romantic occasion, ofc that creates a weird tension. It would have been the minimum to allow Alex to come and be adult about their issues for that day to enable you to join.", "YTA   and your gf is mentally exiting your relationship.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are going to a wedding where your gf was explicitely uninvited / not invited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are an AH.

Now if you had a significant other who you care about, THAT would be different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour relationship will not survive this. Your gf can do better. If your gf has any sense, expect to be single when you come home.", "YTA. The fact that you hold Tina\u2019s feelings at a higher importance than your partner suggests to me that there\u2019s more to y\u2019all\u2019s relationship than you\u2019re disclosing here. You\u2019re essentially juggling two women. You blame the other woman for your gf not liking her. Of course she wouldn\u2019t like her! You have some type of close, serious relationship with another woman. Imagine if the shoe were on the other foot. If this was just a platonic friend college, she shouldn\u2019t matter as much as your gf. Then she\u2019s decided to exclude your gf from this major event that you absolutely must be in attendance to show your love and support. Why because the other woman simply doesn\u2019t like your gf. You\u2019re triangulating and insisting that your partner accept this other woman who btw is excluding her. WHAT?? Even if this was some type of normal \u2018friendship\u2019, the fact that the other woman is rejecting your gf and you\u2019re ok with that \u2014 it shows how little importance you\u2019ve placed on your relationship. You couldn\u2019t be more inconsiderate. This scenario where your esteemed friend has drawn a line in the sand and you\u2019re accepting of that, is a huge red flag here. You\u2019ve made your choice. Your gf would be best advised to leave you to your other woman and find someone who values her.", "YTA - If you don't really care to find out *why* your old friend hates your GF enough to ban her from a wedding.. you don't care enough about your GF to continue dating.\n\nLike, at least get all this information? Because *the vibes are bad* is actually not a reason at all.", "**YTA** \n\nTina should not have prohibited you from bringing your gf as your date, just because of \u201cbad vibes\u201d. Weddings are full of couples and dancing. It is odd that you were expected to go solo. \n\nTina and Alex both know this is just a power move on Tina\u2019s part. \n\nAlex expressed her opinion *months ago* and asked you not to go. You didn\u2019t listen to her.", "YTA and if you go to this wedding you most likely won\u2019t have a gf anymore. And Tina will most likely never forgive you for saying no last minute. So now it\u2019s whether you want to prioritise your relationship with Alex or your friendship with Tina.", "You realize that if you and Alex decide to get married at some point, she won\u2019t want Tina in or at the wedding. \n\nIf you\u2019re serious about Alex you need to figure out what is going one.", "If Tina really wanted you there, she could easily tolerate Alex being there too.  This is Tina being purposely hurtful to Alex, and you going along with it and endorsing it.  YTA", "NTA.  Your girlfriend knows Tina is an important friend to you.  She has made no effort, has decided she \"just doesn't like Tina\" and has kept things bad between them.  Of course she was not invited to the wedding!  What was she expecting with her behavior?  There is such a thing as trying to get along, or excusing yourself.  Is she going to be a dick to all your friends one by one and then insist you only hang out with her?  If she had made an effort, or had a concrete reason for never giving your friend a chance it would be different.  This is Tina's wedding, not some almost date you are going on with Tina.  Your girlfriend needs to see that her actions have consequences.  And that it is normal to be baseline polite with your partners close friends even if you don't especially like them.", "YTA, don\u2019t worry too much, you\u2019ll probably be single soon. \n\nYou always back your partner and now you have given your friend the most \u201cimportant\u201d status and dismissing your partners feelings. Even if they don\u2019t get along, your partner is your partner, she should of been invited.", "YTA. so you plan on inviting Tina to your potential wedding with Alex? Because that won\u2019t happen. The wedding and the whole relashionship I mean.", "Your friendship mean more then your relationship you probably went on and on how you can\u2019t let your friend down and allow your friend to talk shit about your girlfriend \n\nYTA.   For missing out why they don\u2019t get along because you do know", "Alex and everyone in this thread are crazy. If you don\u2019t forbid Alex from seeing her friends that you don\u2019t like or have beef with then she should not do the same. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s an AH move for both of them to drag you into their beef and expect you to pick sides like this. You aren\u2019t going to the wedding to make some statement that you think Alex is wrong and Tina is right, you just want to support a friend on their special day. That\u2019s all. NTA", "I wouldn\u2019t say that YTA in this situation, I\u2019ve been in a very similar situation and it certainly wasn\u2019t clear cut. \n\nYou probably should have made the effort to include Alex into your friendship with Tina in the betwixt time between the engagement announcement and the wedding, there was time to sort this out, and going along with her being excluded doesn\u2019t exactly exhume confidence in your relationship with Alex.\n\nThat said. Tina is a life long friend, and wanted you involved in her day. That\u2019s lovely. \n\nI think this situation could perhaps have been handled with a bit more emotional intelligence for the two women in your life who are important to you. For not trying to resolve that situation before now is probably an oversight on your behalf, but I suspect it\u2019s gone too far to resolve now. \n\nNow the wedding has passed, if I were you I would focus on your relationship with Alex to ensure she feels secure in your relationship with her\u2026. Else this may just be the beginning of the end.", "Of course you are a YTA, and what did you think was going to happen? Where my partner is not welcome, I don't go either. It's actually very simple. I'm not sure that your relationship will survive, because your partner is not a priority.", "YTA...\n\nIts groveling time with Alex, and time to reconsider if Tina is as good a friend as you think...", "YTA. If you want to prioritize your friend\u2019s feelings over your girlfriend\u2019s that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t expect your girlfriend to stay with you. I hope she has the backbone and self-esteem to get out of this situation.", "Yta you're about to be single lol", "yta\n\nyour partner should ALWAYS come before your friends but by accepting the wedding invite you made it clear that you place tina above alex\n\nI won\u2019t be surprised if alex dumps you after this", "NTA.  Tina is your good friend, so much so that she asked you to be in her wedding party and you were happy to do it.   \n\nI would say even if Alex never gave you her \"permission\", you had every right to go.  Even if you were married to Alex, I would say the same thing.  There is no big drama between the two, they just don't like each other. So why should that preclude you from being friends with Tina and supporting her at her wedding?\n\nThis is about Alex's ego, nothing more.  If she can't get over it, that's her problem.", "You\u2019ve got yourself in a tough spot here. I\u2019m going with NTA. Your partner shouldn\u2019t make you choose between them and a longtime friend. She is looking for drama.\n\nYes, in the end you have to choose your partner over all else, but it sounds like she\u2019s resented your friendship with Tina from the beginning, and has been gunning for you guys to end it. That\u2019s completely ridiculous and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve stuck to your guns about maintaining this friendship. Good friendships last longer than many romantic relationships.\n\nTina is under no obligation to invite someone who hates her to her wedding. So she\u2019s not TA either.\n\nIn the end, you\u2019ve got to decide who\u2019s most important to you. In the long run, you have to choose your partner. So is Alex enough to give up your friendship with Tina? It looks like she isn\u2019t.", "Yta. If it was important to Tina that you attend, then she would have included your gf. You chose your friend over your gf. \n\nBut since you know that Tina doesn't want to be around her, you will obviously never invite Tina to anything that includes your gf, right? So she won't be coming to any birthday parties, holiday events or your future wedding I'd you marry your gf. She and you set the precedent so you both have nothing to complain about.", "Friend should invite girlfriend who doesn't have to go. The invitation would be a sign of respect for your relationship. Since friend is reacting to gf's hostile energy. My take?  Gf is jealous. This is someone important to you?  Shares your career?  Oh yeah. Jealousy.  Even though friend is marrying another the friendship and closeness bothers her. Right or wrong to have these feelings I don't know but she does. She should be included", "Yes. You're 100% the AH. \n\nYTA", "You are an idiot. You\u2019re relationship with one of these women is over. Maybe not now but soon.\n\nIf you decide to marry Alex you know Tina\u2019s not invited, right!\n\nAlex will never tolerate Tina being in her life or yours, you have to choose. \n\nIf you choose Tina, no woman will ever tolerate her because it is clear you have a problem setting boundaries. \n\nChoose Tina and die alone, unless you can convince her to leave her husband for you. \n\nYou\u2019re The Asshole.", "NTA\n\nI love how whenever it\u2019s a guy uncomfortable with a male friendship it\u2019s all NTA for the woman.", "NTA\n\nyou were never going to win that one whichever decision you made.", "NTA when you are trying to stay neutral but don't be surprised when your girlfriend wants to throw parties or have group gatherings and Tina is not invited.

You don't accept an invitation that specifically excludes your girlfriend and you don't invite someone to a wedding and tell them not to bring their partner.", "YTA, it\u2019s one thing for Tina to ask you to be in the wedding, but to do that and then literally tell you that your significant other isn\u2019t invited at all is completely unacceptable. I\u2019d have right then and there explained that\u2019s not going to work. Why would you want to spend the whole day at Tina\u2019s wedding without Alex? It\u2019s a pretty memorable occasion and borderline romantic for couples. How much fun can you possibly have without Alex? I think you must have some kind of romantic feelings for Tina to actually consider this. That or you have zero respect for Alex/don\u2019t like Alex really, and either way YTA. You don\u2019t get to just leave your significant other at home whenever you want because your friend told you to.", "Need info: why does she hate Alex so much? If they never had positive interactions I wouldn\u2019t want Alex at the wedding either. Caught between a rock and a hard place really.", "NTA. I\u2019ve met girls and instantly taken a dislike to them and there wasn\u2019t a solid reason for it so that whole there has to be a reason they dislike each other is totally wrong. You don\u2019t always like everyone. Second this was your friends wedding and you committed to being there. I\u2019m not one of those people where I start seeing someone and my friends become second class so no I don\u2019t judge you on that. Third for all those insisting Tina should have invited her please I\u2019m not inviting someone to my wedding that I don\u2019t like not a chance. At the end of the day though I think you can safely say this relationship is done for", "YTA \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel like I have a dog in this fight\u201d you are literally the only reason they know each other, for you to somehow absolve yourself of any responsibility in getting involved in this is mind blowing", "Coming from a guy\u2019s perspective, YTA!!!!!!", "NTA.

I don't think your going to be in a relationship for long to worry about the fall out.", "NTA. Idc what anyone else is saying. You told her and she relented and said she doesn\u2019t care. Obviously she should have stated her truth clearly but didn\u2019t. She can\u2019t go back and forth and lack basic clear communication. Assuming nothing super crazy happened between you and the bride or between your GF and the bride it\u2019s all petty. They need to hash it out someway.\n\nEdit for typos", "Yeah 100% YTA and shouldn\u2019t have gone in the first place without your partner. It\u2019s clear you chose your friend over your partners feelings, also the fact that you have no idea why they don\u2019t like each other says a lot.

Do they just not vibe, or do they get into screaming matches and shoving each other over the tiniest thing? Unless these two women get into actual arguments, I think its ridiculous of Tina to exclude Alex. You keep saying she\u2019s your friend and its important to her for you to attend, especially as a bridesman. You should have put your foot down about Alex attending when Tina first asked you. If she really wanted you there she wouldn\u2019t care about your plus one. What are the chances she\u2019ll even say more than five words to Alex at her WEDDING?", "NTA\n\nAs far as I could tell, you're not in a committed relationship. If you were engaged or together for 4 or 5 years, but really, you guys are just dating.  Did I miss anything like you're living together?\n\nEven if your SO got along with the bride, it wouldn't be uncommon for the OP not to have a plus one without a commitment. Additionally, the OP is going to be running around with wedding party responsibilities. It's not like they will be spending much time together. \n\nHowever, is being right worth it?  Is this your hill to die on?  This could plant a seed breaking up the relationship. Being right doesn't mean you win.  Perhaps a compromise?  Go to the ceremony, do the pictures, and skip the reception?", "You are a complete delusional asshole.", "Wtf is up with all these YTA judgments?\n\nDude has known Tina for years and they're clearly close. If his girlfriend can't handle him having this friendship, that's her own issue to solve. Everyone here is an adult treating this like the end of the world, it's not. Also why does GF even want to go to this wedding? If my husband and I were in the same situation, I'd be happy to skip the wedding of someone I don't like. \n\nAnd lastly, can we all stop pretending that we should read our partners minds? It drives me up the fucking wall when I tell hubs that I'm fine with whatever and then he goes on a damn journey trying to figure out what I really mean because \"everyone knows that when a woman says that she really means it's not fine.\" (Therapy is helping) If it's not fine, then use your freaking words. Or at least understand that you said it was OK and now your feelings are your own problem. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Alex doesn't get to change her mind so late in the game.\n\nIf she hadnt changed her mind. I would have been  NAH.  It's a no win situation.", "NTA, you\u2019re right that their beef is their beef. It\u2019s unfair that you\u2019ve been dragged into the middle of it. You said yourself that your gf has friends you don\u2019t get along with and you don\u2019t pitch a fit about her seeing them. She seems to think her feelings are more important than yours", "I'm the off vote. NTAH. Everyone involved consented to your participation.  You are a member of the wedding party. You have an obligation.  If it were truly such an issue, there were reasonable times to discuss it.\nNow is it wrong to not invite Alex?

She and I have been friends since freshman year of college and since we work in the same field in the same city we've remained pretty close. We'll call her Tina. I started dating my GF Alex a year and a half ago. They DO NOT get along. So I can't pinpoint exactly why they don't.  Alex always says she just doesn't like Tina. Tina typically is just responding to Alex's energy. I don't try to get them to be besties, but I just want for them to get along because they both are very important to me. \n\nSo when Tina got engaged and she told me that she wanted me to be in her wedding which I was incredibly excited to do this for her. It however was difficult for me to make a decision as to whether or not to do this because Tina told me she wasn't fully comfortable with Alex coming. Which I guess makes sense, since they don't like each other. However I personally didn't feel like I had a dog in this fight. Their beef is theirs, not mine and I don't see why I should be limited in my relationships with either of them.\n\nI told Alex I wanted to go and she was apprehensive. She said that if Tina didn't want her to go, she didn't think I should go. I said I didn't think it was fair for her to say that. This is a huge event for Tina and she really wants me there and I really want to go and she really wants me there. I also said that there are friends of Alex I don't get along with and I don't stop her from seeing them. Alex eventually relented and said that she didn't care if I went or not. Months go by and the wedding happens and Tina's wedding comes up, at this point it's too late for me to just quit last minute and Alex again tells me that she doesn't want me to go. \n\nThis is like a week out of the wedding. I told her I couldn't flake last minute like that and I went to the wedding and had a good time. Now, Alex is telling me that I'm a huge dick and that I care about Tina's feelings more than hers. Now she's pissed at me when she gave me the go ahead to attend the wedding without her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Yta, you chose the one you want over the one you're with", "First I think Tina is the A. She knows that\u2019s who you are with. She shouldn\u2019t have put you in that position especially as there doesn\u2019t seem to have been an event that caused this. Be an adult and just be polite. No one said she had to hang out with Alex. I also think you should have said no. You chose her being an immature ass over you gf. I\u2019d have been very upset that it was even a question. It would be different if Alex had done something really wrong and had caused this. I think Tina is probably jealous", "INFO: How big is the \u201chuge event\u201d wedding? Did you just not get a plus one or is it just that Alex can\u2019t be your plus one? Did other people not get plus ones or was it limited to you?\n\nUnfortunately, when close friends and SOs don\u2019t get along, you get caught in the middle. That being said, it was an A H move for Tina to ask you to be in the wedding party and not let you bring your GF. And unless it\u2019s a small-ish wedding, it was an A H move for you not to defend your GF, assuming you\u2019re serious about her. Plus ones are normal, especially for someone asked to be in the wedding party. I\u2019ve seen friendships spectacularly explode over a bride gatekeeping a bridesmaid\u2019s plus one. \n\nAlex saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t care\u201d if you went or not? That was her saying she didn\u2019t want to have a fight but still wanted you to stand by her.

It\u2019s up the the people getting married to make the guest list. Why would your gf want to go to a wedding of someone she doesn\u2019t like?

If she couldn't suck it up and get along with Alex for the length of the wedding then she should have asked somebody else.\n\nThere are situations where you don't give somebody a plus one, but this is not one of them. \n\nAnd since Tina was very much in the wrong, you were in the wrong for agreeing, especially since you *knew* that Alex didn't want you to go. She told you, with her words, that she didn't think you should go. The fact that you argued her down over her perfectly reasonable point does not make you in the right, it just makes you more YTA.\n\nFurthermore: you did have a dog in this fight, and you chose Tina over Alex. Also, you know perfectly well that Alex wasn't asking you to never see Tina again, she was asking you *not to be part of her wedding party*, so your silly argument about how you don't keep Alex from seeing those friends you don't like was totally invalid and you know it.\n\nYou need to apologize, big time.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what irked me here too.

I refused to allow his girlfriend to attend, not out of any petty revenge, but because the few times that my (now) wife had interacted with her, she was simply horrible.  My best friend is an adult and can date whoever he likes, but we weren't going to allow a person like her to possibly derail our wedding, especially since we already had to deal with my wife's sister, who is also a real \"winner.\"  He also understood that this was our wedding and our decision to make.  She did not and wanted him to back out.  The man has been my best friend and \"brother\" for over 30 years, and he chose to attend.\n\nThey broke up a few months before our wedding.  My best friend started noticing the behaviors that we had seen, so he called it quits.

It's not a grand statement and there's nothing disrespectful about excluding someone you do not like from an event you're organizing and paying for. If it were any other event, say a big party, would there still be an issue? \n\nShe's literally just inviting people she actually likes to her wedding. Alex is making it into a huge deal when it doesn't need to be one.", "It's not to appease the \"rules\", it to be a good friend to someone she supposed likes enough to ask him to be a bridesman. It's a dick move to put your friend in that position with their SO so you suck it up and include the person they share their life with. Otherwise you are not going to be able to remain friends for long. At least not close friends.\n\nEtiquette is what we as a society have decided is the best way to behave. It changes and evolves, but generally you will be in the right if you follow it. No one is going to force you to though just like no one is going to force you to put your cart back after shopping. Not putting back though will get you labeled an AH.", "The good reason is that OPs girlfriend doesn't like her?\n\nDo you regularly hang out with people who don't like you? I don't haha. Especially don't want them at my wedding!", "lol what? You really think OP wants to cheat with Tina? What if Tina was male? Anyway, it\u2019s  not OPs job to settle the beef of other people. He\u2019s not their dad and they are adults so they can do it themselves. \n\nAlso stop being so obtuse. Alex is using the fact that she doesn\u2019t want OP to go as a reason for why he can\u2019t and should not go. Why else would she even tell him that if it wasn\u2019t a reason for why he can\u2019t?", "That is called lying he didn\u2019t need to wear her down because he doesn\u2019t need her permission to do basic things she doesn\u2019t own him? She doesn\u2019t get to control she gets to have boundaries and he isn\u2019t required to follow him a boundary is \u201cif you go without me I\u2019m leaving\u201d not \u201cyou CANT DO THIS\u201d", "No one was forced to bring someone who wasn't invited (because they're the source of the drama/beef) to the wedding", "Okay? Then you also shouldn\u2019t ask their partner to be in your wedding party.", "Not even that the bride doesn't like the gf... gf openly doesn't like the bride. It's super weird to expect an invite.", "No, I don\u2019t regularly hang out with people I don\u2019t like but I absolutely had people at my wedding who I barely knew or even didn\u2019t like as much as others. Unless I hated them to the point they made me uncomfortable I\u2019d be fine. I like the spouses of some of my close friends other than others, I absolutely would not expect my closest friends to understand that their long term partners can\u2019t come because, \u201cI don\u2019t like them.\u201d My best friends would expect a better explanation and they would be right to so do.", "That and why would she turn around and throw it in his face as some sort of gotcha if she wasn't trying to force him to choose her comfort over his friend's wedding? I swear I cannot wrap my mind around these comments lmao this is so clearly an attempt from Alex to control her partner and it's so normalized that people don't see anything wrong with it.", "He chose his friend over his girlfriend. There is no way he is so oblivious that he actually thought his gf was okay with his going. Tina gave him an ultimatum to pick her or his girlfriend and he chose Tina.", "She never said you can't do this. Are some of you having trouble understanding the difference between \"I really don't want you to go\" and \"YOU CANT GO\" if I need to explain I will.", "She shared how she felt, and he didn\u2019t listen at all until he got the answer she wanted. \n\nLet me make it clear, I don\u2019t agree with Alex and I certainly don\u2019t think she \u201cowns\u201d her bf. But what we\u2019re trying to point out is that the bf can\u2019t even be bothered to try to understand his gf. He doesn\u2019t even show that he cares\n\nIf Alex was invited to a guy friend wedding and the guy specifically uninvited OP due to mysterious beef, I also think SHE would be an  a hole if she didn\u2019t try to understand both sides.\n\nPlus she never said \u201cYOU CANT GO\u201d she said she didn\u2019t want him to go. MASSIVE difference", "No its not. You shouldn't have to fight thus hard when you don't want your partner to do something.", "They've only been dating for a year and a half though. Their friendship is way longer than that. More than double the time.", "Why would I consider that though? I don't owe it to someone's partner, who I barely know and am not friends with, to consider *their* feelings about *my* wedding.", "SHE DOESNT GET TO CONTROL WHAT HE DOES SHE DOESNT GET A SAY IN WHAT SHE WANTS HIM TO DO SHE DOESNT OWN HIM", "Okay and I\u2019m telling you what the widely accepted rules of etiquette are for having someone in your wedding party specifically. The deal is that you\u2019re asking a lot of them for your special day in terms of time and money and in return they get a +1 regardless of relationship status. If she didn\u2019t want the girlfriend there that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s her wedding, but she should\u2019ve invited him as a guest if she didn\u2019t want him bringing a date, especially since I can almost guarantee everyone else in the wedding party got a +1. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly rude to do when she\u2019s asking him to go to the rehearsal dinner the night before and spend time rehearsing, spend money on a specific outfit, and then spend the entire wedding day doing things for the bride/with the bridal party. Because of this the rules are different for the bridal party, no matter how much the bride spends on guest meals the members of the wedding party have almost always had to spend more to be in the wedding.", "I doubt you'll get anywhere with this point. The majority of commenters here seem to think it's totally normal to prioritize a romantic partner above all else, including to the detriment of your friends. \n\nOP made the right decision in going. Alex is gonna have to figure out how to handle her feelings. Therapy would probably help."]}
