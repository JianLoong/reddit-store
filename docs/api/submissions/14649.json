I thought something bad had happened but Elle told me that she was crying because she became 2nd in their grade. That night I decided to take her to her favorite restaurant to celebrate and cheer her up a bit so the 3 of us went to celebrate then I took the girls to their mom's homes. \n\nAn hout later Elle's mom called me to tell me I'm an asshole for only celebrating Jade. I told her that it's not like we oredered a cake with Jade's name on it or didn't take Elle with us.

The way you set this up very obviously overshadowed Elle.\n\n> or didn't take Elle with us\n\nYou took her WITH you. As in, she was not the essential party, or the person being celebrated. She was an optional celebrant.", "YTA Not only for showing obvious preferential treatment, letting Elle tag along to Jade\u2019s celebration is not treating Elle well. But you are teaching Jade that throwing a fit gets rewarded. This scenario would have been a great time to teach Jade a valuable lesson about not always coming in first, being a good sport so to speak. You did a grave disservice to both girls.", "YTA - It\u2019s totally normal for one child to excel at a certain area and another child to do excel in different areas. You\u2019re supposed to show love and appreciation for both of your daughters not the one you believe is better at something.\n\nYou celebrating only Jade\u2019s achievement is such an asshole move. Especially having Elle there the entire time and not celebrating her\u2026for something she equally participated in.", "YTA. Regardless of who \"needed cheering up\" or \"did a better job,\" both girls should have been celebrated. Also, you do realize that test taking is not indicative of itelligence, right? It just means that certain people do better on standardized tests, which very rarely translates to real world success.", "YTA.\n\nThe dinner was for one kid and the fact that your ex called means that the 15 year old felt excluded and hurt but didn't know how to tell you.", "YTA. If you wanted to play favorites, then take them out separately. Instead you let Elle be third wheel even though she did *great*. Unless this is a class size of 18 people, it sounds like 17 is still an accomplishment for a daughter you obviously don't think is very bright.", "YTA, both of them did extremely well, both deaerved to be celebrated", "YTA\n\nStop comparing your children to each other!\n\nThey are 2 separate people with different talents and abilities. \n\nAnd you should really get Jade to understand that even if she tries her hardest, she will not always be first, and that's ok. And, that someone else's accomplishment (Elle's for example) can also be celebrated.\n\nJust because Elle didn't do as well as Jade, doesn't mean that Elle didn't accomplish something great for her. What you're actually teaching your daughters is that if Elle never does as well as Jade, then it doesn't matter how well she does, or how hard she tries, she'll never be good enough. And, at the same time, your teaching Jade that her only worth comes from her comparison to others, and she's only worthy if she does better than everyone else.\n\nTeach them that their best effort is good enough, and that is worth celebrating!", "YTA and here's what stands out to me.\n\n*First Elle arrived and happily told me that she became 17th in their grade*\n\nThen you completely ignored Elle in favor of Jade the entire evening making her accomplishment nothing. An accomplishment that **she was proud of**. You showed her that meant nothing in your eyes.\n\nYeah, way to go dad. You just showed her that you don't love her as much as being first. You let her tag along to see how amazing Jade is. I'm sure that was a wonderful experience for her. \n\nNext time I promise you she won't even tell you how she did.

Guess which one got to choose dinner? Both. They both did a great job so Friday she chose dinner and he chose dessert while Saturday he chose dinner and she chose dessert. \n\nIt would be so easy for my daughter to feel inferior to her brother. All I would have to do is praise him for his usual straight A report card and barely acknowledge her improvement. Kinda like you did with your girls. Instead, I highlighted both accomplishments equally.", "So here\u2019s a question for you, OP. Are you TRYING to create a situation where your daughters grow up to dislike and resent each other? Because that\u2019s what happens when a parent plays favorites, as you are.

So stop being an AH parent and do better.", "YTA. You could have celebrated both on passing the test. Elle probably told her mom about this because it hurt her feelings.

I hope Elle finds a point in her life where she cuts you out for good, for her own health, and I hope it\u2019s soon.", "YTA - Both girls passed their test.  The fact that you singled one out above the other is disgusting.  There seems to be such emphasis on Jade that she cried because she didn't get 1st.\n\nYour an asshole and Elle's mom is right.  Way to show Elle you don't care about her", "Yta. \n\n You could have just gone out anywhere. But you chose to go to the better kids' favorite restaurant.  That's not cool.", "YTA.  You are playing favorites based on grades which is a poor ranking system.  And there's nothing wrong with NOT being competitive, not everyone is and that doesn't mean you are not going to do well.\n\nI've known kids that did amazing in school and turned out to be duds in college or later life and kids that didn't do as well in school that excelled after they graduated.   What should matter is that they are doing the best job they can as well as improve where they can.  And know how to handle let downs such as only being 2nd like Jade was.  Trust me, Elle was watching and seeing how you favored her sister and won't forget.  If not for this, I'm sure elsewhere as you described your daughters.", "YTA. Regardless who did better both are wonderful achievements. You should've taken both of their accomplishments into consideration. \n\nI understand tending to the daughter who was more emotionally distraught but there are better ways than singling out the \"better\" daughter to appease her.\n\nyou probably made Elle feel like she's not good enough. hence YTA", "YTA. And yet you continue to argue that you did nothing wrong. Why bother posting here if you\u2019re gonna act like a baby? \n\nYou show obvious favoritism and are very dismissive with Elle. I hope they both learn that you are not providing them with proper guidance and that they both deserve to be cared about, regardless of a test grade. \n\nAlso, Jade will certainly spin out when she is unable to reach your stupid expectations for what perfection is and that is when you will lose both of your daughters. And you will have no one to blame but yourself, simply due to the fact that you can\u2019t handle that you\u2019re wrong.", "I don't know out of HOW many that 17 is.  but it seems pretty good to me as well.(per comments still top 26%)\n\nYou absolutely could have celebrated both.   And boohoo Jade got 2nd so we have to pamper her pity party?\n\nOP=YTA\n\nElle will remember your attitude that she isn't worthy according to you.  TRUST me 35 yrs from now SHE will remember.  IF you love her, figure out a way to stop being so judgmental.  Turns out that Valedictorians aren't necessarily the most successful person in the class.  Lots with lower grade points achieve success.  And you'll should figure out how to help Jade deal with her compulsion to be first.  She will have problems in life if she perceives 2nd place as failure.\n\nPS Smart people will tell you FAILURE is the best teaching tool out there.  And learning to deal with failure is one of the most important lessons.  Instead, people like Jade see themselves as \"Failing\" if they aren't #1 and they spiral, just as she did(emotionally) this time.", "Info: Was Elle upset about this too, or just Elle's mom?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You see it as preparing them for the world but what you\u2019re really doing is driving a wedge between the girls so it\u2019s harder for them to develop a relationship that will help them maintain family after you\u2019re gone. You will be lucky if the oldest daughter wants to keep you in her life after she starts her own adult life. You\u2019re also setting a bad example of how to treat family so it\u2019ll be harder for her to have healthy relationships where people trust and support each other.  \n  \nHopefully, you\u2019re just a troll.", "Yep. Definitely a yta for this reason. And in addition, I do think the school is an ah as well. Each kid tried so hard to get the best results, no need to rank them. \n\n(With the wedding example; venues don\u2019t hold a list with the prettiest bride-biggest cake-darkest suit or what ever.

Unless dad wants to be judged every day on how his contributions to the household are, compared to those of the other members)", "That's crazy! My brother and I are like 168 and 170 I think. I always have a hard time remembering it because my mom refused to tell us who had which score. She said she was afraid the smarter one would tease the other.

Was it by a significant amount?\n\nEdited to fix typo", "What maths are you using? That's top 26.15%, but why the hell did you round up?

What can you do? My parents never told me mine, which seemed shady, or maybe I forgot it.

I rounded up to the largest whole number because no one was using decimals. You can't say top 26%. You can only say top 27% without decimals. How is any of that remotely weird?\n\nThe other part, I don't know who you're arguing against. I said I agree top 27% (or 26.15%) is a good score. I don't think her father should deliberately make one of their daughter's accomplishments worse ... Do you think I'm OP?", "And if he keeps raising Jade to believe she gets a comfort dinner and that second place is worth crying over, she's not going to be good at being a functional adult. Ellie will learn how to take care of herself, because of how her father treats her, while Jade will react to very positive responses by crying. She's only young, so she may grow out of it, but not if she's babied like she is currently.", "Don\u2019t be surprised when she stops talking to you, you aren\u2019t invited to her wedding and she finds someone more deserving and a better person to walk her down the aisle either.
