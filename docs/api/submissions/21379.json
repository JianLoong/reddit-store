To put it bluntly, she was a bad influence. (Drugs, shoplifting, bullying, etc). She also lied about being pregnant, having abortions, and having miscarriages several times (this is important). I stayed friends with her for so long because she wasn\u2019t always like that and she used to be so sweet, but eventually it became very obvious that my friend had changed. I felt uncomfortable with the way she treated others.\n\nI\u2019m a people pleaser so I didn\u2019t want to tell her that I didn\u2019t like her anymore so I just tried to distance myself slowly. When she realized, she did NOT react well. It escalated to full scale bullying which absolutely ruined my senior year. Her bf at the time, (M16), Ryan also jumped in on the bullying. For a while, I was receiving death threats, insults about my looks and religion, and a ton of rumors. I tried EVERYTHING to get them to stop. I tried ignoring it, I tried asking them to stop, I tried laughing it off. They wouldn\u2019t quit and my mental health was at an all time low due to some other things going on in my life at the time.\n\nNow, onto the story at hand. One of the rumors that they decided to spread was that I was gay. Honestly, I didn\u2019t care that much. It was annoying but it was my last year of high school so I didn\u2019t care what people thought of me cause it wasn\u2019t really ruining my \u201clove life\u201d or anything lol, and they had already thoroughly ruined my social life. However, there was one day when I had a very bad day and I was tired of everything that was going on when I got a text from Ryan. It went like this:\n\n\u201cHey! I heard you got a new girlfriend! Gay lives suck! Oh, my bad, I meant gay lives matter.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never snapped back. I\u2019m a pretty soft spoken person but I had had enough this day. At this time, I knew Maddie was telling people she had a miscarriage again but she had lied about it so much in the past and no one saw a positive test so I didn\u2019t believe her. So I texted Ryan back and my exact words were:\n\n\u201cHey! I heard Maddie had another miscarriage! Congratulations! Oh, my bad, I meant my condolences.\u201d\n\nIt was a petty cheap insult, I\u2019ll admit that. Ryan did not take it well. I got a a veryyyy long paragraph of threats and insults after that but they never bothered me again. That being said, school ended soon after so they didn\u2019t have many chances to mess with me after that anyways. \n\nI feel bad for saying it to Ryan though because he had only known Maddie for a few months and doesn\u2019t know about her history of lying so he probably really did think she had a miscarriage with his child. Part of me feel bad but another part of me thinks that they deserved it.
