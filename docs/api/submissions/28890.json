Time to sit down and have a real conversation about her plans and put an end date to her staying with you guys. Reddit will scream lawyer up and legalities at you and that might be an issue but I would start with a conversation. \n\nAnd you can of course say that you don\u2019t like the surprise houseguests but it can also be that she wants to date and feels safer bringing the guys to your place then going to their place? Just a thought.", "Nta. She's not a roommate or a tenant. She's a homeless house guest you allowed to stay to get back on her feet.\nHer bedroom is for a safe place to live. If she wants to get laid, she can move into her own place. \nYou're allowed to set strict boundaries on who is allowed into your home, and who can have visitors.", "NTA.  All of the guests in your home must meet with your approval because the safety of everyone is at stake.  Sister should be shown the door if she breaks the rule again.", "INFO: Am I understanding this right, that she IS working now (having found and quit a job and then landed another job already)? \n\nIf so, why is she still there? I understand wanting to let her save for a rental so not asking her rent, but is there at least a plan for her to move out?", "NTA if she wants to have visitors she should move out and have her guests over in her own place. I think if she already has a job you're well within your rights to tell her to move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She could quit and say, sorry, no job, can't go.", "I just wouldn't want strangers in my house through the night at all. I don't think the sister is wrong for wanting to date but I just wouldn't feel safe myself in this situation.\n\nAnother conversation is a good idea, about moving out, job hunting and no strangers in OP's house. They could at least meet up beforehand socially.", "Yeah she lost her job in June, got a job in august-left because it was toxic and found a new job in September. Yeah I think it\u2019s time my husband and I sat down with her to go over a game plan. I think our hesitation is that we didn\u2019t want to overwhelm or kick her when she\u2019s down but now I think she\u2019s taking advantage.", "Yeah, I think that's the real issue, she's staying past when she needs the help. If she's on her way out and it's very temporary that she's staying with you then you're entirely reasonable to say no guests. If it were longer term it would be more difficult to \"justify\" that rule (though you'd still have the right to make it). \n\nNTA"]}
