He always claims he wants to involve me in higher level projects but never does, thus stagnating my career development. I\u2019m in my 20\u2019s and female. \n\nINFO:\n1. In a meeting with me one time, he was complaining about a female co worker to me saying she was \u201cstepping on my toes\u201d.

In response to these statements, I told him I liked the female co-worker and thought she was an asset to the team, to which he said nothing in support.\n\n2. The boss was asked to take several days off work one time due to him loosing his temper and yelling in a meeting. (I wasn\u2019t in this meeting, but his brief LOA was announced). \n\n3. He put myself (female, 10 years younger than him) on a performance plan with no merit or warning. One statement in the plan was actually a lie that I was able to prove to be untrue. Some examples included me being 5 min late to a meeting that he moved the time on the last minute. Or me not understanding subjective directions from him (he would tell me to do a certain task \u201ca few\u201d times, and held me accountable for doing the task 3 times and not 4 times). \n\n4. I reported him one time to our team lead for gaslighting me and diminishing my knowledge. He was trying to accuse me of not understanding how to do my basic job functions, and kept sending me messages on our slack documenting these claims. At this point I had been in my position over a year and was fully aware of how to perform basic job functions. I tried calling him to clear the air and explain the situation at hand, but he wouldn\u2019t take my call. Our of fear, I called our team lead to clarify that I knew how to perform basic job functions and I didn\u2019t want my boss to build a false narrative about me. (I don\u2019t know if any follow up was done on this conversation, but I know the team lead talked to him about the report). Ironically, the only items my boss noted that were \u201cperformance issues\u201d with me were AFTER I met with the team lead. My boss has never previously mentioned any of the supposed \u201cperformance issues\u201d to me prior. I\u2019ve always wondered if the performance plan was a retaliation from him. \n\n5. He regularly has told me that the team leads on other departments \u201cnever know what\u2019s going on\u201d and need to have reminder notes sent to them daily. \n\n6. I included all of these above concerns in his performance review (and several more) and he ended up still getting promoted to a new team. The only people he took with him to his new team were men.\n\nI guess my conclusion is- should I have just let it go and not pursued a report.", "created_utc": 1667778805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo6v9o/aita_for_reporting_my_boss_to_hr_anonymously_for/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When she finally reported her female boss to HR there was no investigation and my daughter ended up being fired a week or so later. She had lived through months of the same kinds of things, being yelled at, undermined, disrepected, told her work wasn't up to standard, etc., and it wore her down. She got a new job where she's been seen as the asset she is and has had two promotions and raises in ten months. She's up for another one in the new year. Her voice is heard and her input actively sought out now.  Your workplace isn't going to get better. It's time to move on.", "NTA you did the right thing and his behaviour needs to be documented. It sounds like he could potentially be trying to force you out of the job by treating you so poorly. Make plenty of evidence by screenshotting chats and emails incase you need it to defend yourself", "NTA. If he put you on a performance plan before meeting with you to discuss what needed to be corrected and how to correct it, he\u2019s a liability for HR and opening up the company for a retaliation lawsuit. They need to know, and if they continue to promote him despite the complaint, that\u2019s on them.", "The only thing you can do to these fools is report them.   The HR Department has to follow up and determine if there is merit.  Most of them are so full of themselves that they make all kinds of mistakes while trying to prove other people make all kinds of mistakes.  He did.  You didn't.  Hopefully it comes out against him and they see him for the poor employee that he is.\n\nI had a supervisor in another department take a disliking to me.  I just avoided her, wouldn't even look her way, and kept it all business when I had to interact with her.  She had to go to a meeting once about \"Workplace Violence\".   She asked the instructor if it was considered workplace violence when the employee looked at her differently.  The instructor asked, \"Are they giving you dirty looks?  or what exactly is the look.\"  She says, \"No, not a dirty look.  Just one where she really doesn't look at me.\"  The instructor laughed at her and said, \"No, if someone just doesn't look at you then you can't consider it hostile.  They probably just don't like you.\"  I guess the whole room started laughing at that.  Another supervisor came back and told me what went on.  Making something out of nothing is a special class all supervisors take.  It's good you keep track of everything.", "Personally, I would be very conflicted. I usually err on the side of reporting things like this, but my own career has stagnated because of this. I don't think you would the asshole for reporting this, but there is a strong possibility you will pay a price for it. Never underestimate the ability of the chain of command to not even recognize a problem exists, let alone handle it equitably.", "ESH. \n\nHe's worse because he's in a position of power, but you're bringing up things like his yelling when it happened during a meeting you weren't attending.\n\nYou're not doing anything to reduce the toxic environment, you're adding to it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This may actually constitute a hostile work environment (ie: discrimination related to a protected class, in this case gender), but you'd really need to call out the ways in which it meets a legal threat to have any chance of action. \n\nI would just start taking very good notes and think about whether you're willing to go to the EEOC if required (I think that's the acronym. :p)\n\nI thoroughly recommend reading Ask A Manager for advice around this topic, as it comes up a bit.

Because that could cost them money. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US you\u2019re probably at will. Which means that you can be fired for any reason. If they get tired of hearing you complain, they\u2019ll just get rid of you. Because at the end of the day they see all of their employees as cogs with some having more value than others. \n\nRight now your boss has more value to them than you do. So you have a couple of options. You can accept that your company sucks and make a plan to move on. Or you can consult an employment lawyer to see what you need to file suit and spend the rest of your time there gathering evidence. \n\nBecause the only way things will change is if there is a monetary or regulatory penalty to the company.", "Based on what you're describing to build your case here: its clear that you have no idea what a hostile work environment actually is. There's no indication that any of his behaviors are clearly tied to your being a member of a protected class and if your belief that he's \"diminishing your knowledge\" (no idea what that even means) by telling you your performance isn't meeting his standards as the person who literally has the role of assessing your performance relative to his standard is all you have you will simply embarass yourself and destroy all credibility moving forward. \n\nIt's possible he's targeting you for being a woman. It's also possible you're not as good at your job as you think you are and you're choosing not to hear that message to the point that it has had to move to a formal performance improvement plan. I suspect it's the latter based on your laundry list here, not cruelly, truly, but by your own telling. Your professional development is your own responsibility and 30 minutes a week with a manager is actually a lot more one on one time than most people get with their managers. You have to get that you're one of many and management of people is a small percentage of what a manager actually typically does. If he has 10 folks under him that's 300 minutes or 5 hours a week devoted to face time. 20 folks? 10. You get the picture I hope. He's telling you to be more independent and what he expects and how you're not meeting those expectations and you're drawing the wrong conclusion by he just doesn't like me because gender.\n\nHe's allowed to dislike a coworker who also happens to be a woman. He's allowed to share the opinion that other colleagues suck. This stuff makes him a bad manager but it doesn't make your work environment hostile. Take time, self reflect, see mistakes, and take the feedback as an opportunity to grow and learn and improve. You wouldn't be the AH, you would just be naive and high maintenance and unhappy with the outcome in doing so. Going to your team lead and making statements about gas lighting and false narratives is so outside of professional norms, it really is, and if I was your manager I would honestly be wondering why I had you on my team at that point too and having a similar conversation.\n\nAskamanager.org is awesome.
