I can't make an accurate call on reporting the request since we don't know enough.\n\nI completely get feeling off about the situation, but it doesn't sound like you think he was trying to case your apartment to see if it's a good target or anything. You were just thrown by a question you wouldn't normally be asked in that social situation and it took a minute to answer. Given what you've written here I think he was just nervous about his bubble guts and figured a small gamble in asking to do something against policy versus clenching and heading all the way to a cafe from a 4th floor walkup or something. That policy equally protects him from bodily harm, so it wasn't something most people would expect..I think the irritation in his voice came more from \"I gotta take a dump lady!\" (I'm sort of assuming gender tbh) than social engineering/pressure. \n\nHas he been your delivery person for long? Was there something you're not saying in his body language (or maybe not in uniform?) that makes you worried about him delivering to you in the future? If there's other situations and this feels like an escalation it's worth thinking through whether this was an awkward one off or something larger. \n\nIf you realize that you're the frog in the boiling pot and this is the latest in pushing your comfort levels, it could definitely be a lower-stakes way to report inappropriate behavior.", "YWBTA. He asked to use your bathroom, you said no, so he left? Holy shit, and you survived! Don't get a guy in trouble for such a basic human interaction.", "YTA\n\nHe asked, you said no, he left.\n\nDid you feel very unsafe, or did you simply not like the curt tone this peasant dared demonstrate before your highness?", "So let's see.\n\nHe needed the bathroom. He asked politely. You said no. He thanked you and left.\n\nYTA.", "Yes bro you already said no. This is a simple interaction with a stranger and someone who mightve just been needing the bathroom. You must dwell on alot of things huh?", "YWBTA\n\nAsking to go to the bathroom is a pretty normal interaction. He asked, you said no. He thanked you and left. \n\nWhy do you need to think more on it and want to report him to make him lose his job? \n\nThis is a tough job, and a lot of the times they are only fixated in getting to the address in the shortest time, and not so much happily looking around and noting the shops around them.", "YWBTA. He need a bathroom, asked politely, and left when you said no. You have no reason to dump on him.", "Yes you would be the asshole. You said no and he went away. Why are you still on this. Nothing happened", "Yta he just needed the bathroom and left when you said no", "YTA. It would be different if he got angry when you said no, but he thanked you and left.", "YWBTA if you reported him.\n\nI've worked in the freight industry and the toilet provisions for drivers are abysmal. This is specific to my country so not necessarily the same as where you are.\n\nDepending on where these drivers are collecting packages from, they might not even have access to a toilet when they start work in the morning if they're collecting parcels from local businesses. They're not supposed to refuse a request from a driver to use the toilet, but many still do. Usually the people delivering to your house will be different than the ones collecting from local businesses, except if the company is short staffed (which is fairly likely.) \n\nHGV drivers are expected to take breaks from driving so can plan to stop at service stations during their journey. Drivers of smaller vans that deliver to houses are given routes that they need to stick to, otherwise they probably won't be paid if they go off route and end up doing overtime, and nobody wants to do work they're not being paid for (again, not sure on the legality of that but it happens.) Coffee shops usually only allow customers to use their toilet, so he'd need to spend time buying a coffee or something, which can take a while if they're busy. Also, it's likely they're using a company GPS so might not indicate shops in the same way Google maps does.\n\nThis type of work can be very common with people with social anxiety or poor social skills since you're on your own most of the time.\n\nThe decision whether or not to allow someone into your home is up to you, so it's okay if you refused his request. I'm just saying it's possible that he did simply want to use the toilet and chose to ask you for the reasons above, and not because it was something sinister.\n\nEdit: Also, bear in mind that whenever you order something online, lots of people see your name and address, there'll be several admin staff, several warehouse staff and at least two drivers. Depending on the item you've ordered it can be pretty easy to take a guess about your age/gender (warehouses generally get the same sort of freight, so the staff get used to what's coming in and recognise things just from the shape/colour of boxes etc., there doesn't have to be any text on the boxes detailing what's inside.)", "Yes, you would. He wasn't rude or anything and probably didn't wanna take the extra stop, wasting 5 minutes and get behind his delivery times.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say NTA. Delivery drivers should never ask to go into someone's home to use the bathroom. I guarantee you that it is against company policy because it creates a horrendous risk for the company. The fact that he would ask is extremely weird and unprofessional. Especially when he got irritated with you and pressured you to answer. There is something not right about that interaction.", "NTA all these other voters must live in Mr. Roger\u2019s neighborhood bc in the real world you don\u2019t do this, ESPECIALLY when public options are readily available. And this just happened to be a man, if a woman asked my answer would be the same. And honestly it could be a real issue for the company (the customer could have a legitimate or fake complaint) or the man himself (even if he\u2019s a saint, he\u2019s asking to go in a stranger\u2019s house) so really that boundary protects everyone. The reality check could just as easily keep HIM out of danger. \n\nI will change my answer if he works for Amazon. That company treats their employees horribly and they probably aren\u2019t allowed bathroom breaks and the gps is probably tracked bc they\u2019re monsters who want to use every second their employees exist. So if it was Amazon then leave the man alone. He hasn\u2019t gone pee in like a week probably.", "Soft YTA. \n\nIt could be that he genuinely needed the bathroom but didn't know about the bathrooms located nearby. He just was not very polite to ask to use ur bathroom so maybe he was urgent. I mean, he immediately backed off after you mentioned there were other bathrooms nearby? So maybe he was urgent to use the bathroom.\n\nBut, it's understandable that it's scary to let a complete stranger in your house use the bathroom. So in a way, it's good that you didn't let him in?\n\nI don't think he would be fired simply because he just asked to use the bathroom if you called them up anyway.\n\nIt really just sounds like a normal interaction: he genuinely needed the bathroom and didn't know where else to look.", "Tricky one! \n\nDepending where you are (in Australia? Mention of \u2019cafe\u2019 suggests you might be), these guys get paid peanuts and hunting about for a loo is a real issue.   \nBUT\u2026 there was a cafe NEXT DOOR?   \n\n\nI never have an issue letting tradies use my toilet, but a parcel guy is a bit different\u2026 You say you had \u2018a very weird vibe\u2019, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to say NTA and to let them know. If he does it once he probably won\u2019t get fired (no where enough delivery drivers in Oz!), but if he has a pattern of it then possibly.   \n\n\nOnly real issue I see is if he\u2019s your local courier expect grief in the future if you complain about him. I had the local Fastrack guy fuck up on a parcel, swear black and blue he\u2019d delivered something into my letterbox (which there\u2019s zero possibility it\u2019d fit!) and forever after I made every effort to never, ever, get something delivered by Fastrack, and the one occasion he was supposed to deliver he didn\u2019t knock, he didn\u2019t even come to my place, he just made my parcel be \u2018collection from delivery centre\u2019. Ie\u2026 he refused to deliver to me again.", "NTA, because driver should have asked for nearest bathroom instead.

If some predator knows what he's doing, he knows better than to make a scene at someone's house when he doesn't have control of the situation. It's possible that it was nothing, but if it was nothing he can go next door to the cafe for the bathroom or any thousands of gas stations on the way to his next drop off.

Its about him giving weird vibes, about him having opportunity to literary ask next door cafee which he could not miss. You clearly are not reading what i said also. I told her to ask police about the situation because they actualy have experience with stuff like that and they can actualy give her good advice if she should report it to company or not. I didnt say reporting him to police..."]}
