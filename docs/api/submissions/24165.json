Although, that's a weird request on it's own and I'm pretty sure it's against the policy of most delivery companies, the whole interaction was very weird.\nThe guy straight up asked me to use the bathroom the moment I got the package into my hands (wasn't exactly polite about it). I kinda froze because I was caught of guard, my polite side thinking sure let him use the bathroom, but all my instincts saying otherwise. Then the guy clearly irritated said \"Well just tell me yes or no?\" To which I responded by informing him that there was a cafe right next to my house , told him exactly where, although impossible to miss, he thanked me and left. \nI don't know if I'm exaggerating or overthinking it, but the whole interaction had a very weird vibe and made me feel really uncomfortable. Also I should note that I live in a quit busy area and there are literally 20 coffee places and restaurants within less than 500 meters, which made the request even weirder and hard to believe it was sincere. There's no way that, even if he somehow didn't pass by any of them on his way, he didn't see them on the GPS... \nI was thinking of contacting the company and letting them know about the whole interaction, which will probably get the guy fired. But days after, I'm still thinking about it.. it truly made me feel uncomfortable and I'm thinking it's a possible safety concern issue I should inform them about. So WIBTA if I contacted the company and possibly get the guy fired in the process?\n\n\nEDIT:  Ok I didn't expect so many comments, so I'll try to clarify a few things.\n\n1) I don't want to get the guy fired, especially over something that could be a misunderstanding from my part, that's why I  was hesitant about reporting the incident\n\n2) I don't live in the USA, here everyone can use a bathroom in a cafe freely so that's what made it weird.\n\n3) I wasn't thinking about reporting the guy just for asking to use my toilet, but because I perceived the whole interaction as weird... The tone, the body language, something seemed off. Sorry can't explain it better through text. Also the reason I was thinking about reporting the event was out of concern in case he wasn't sincere and someone else ended up letting him in.\n(Ps. He wasn't wearing a uniform but I don't know if it is something required from the specific company)\n\n4) Don't worry I'm not going to report it.", "created_utc": 1691472219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l8jup/wibta_if_i_got_a_delivery_guy_fired/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't make an accurate call on reporting the request since we don't know enough.\n\nI completely get feeling off about the situation, but it doesn't sound like you think he was trying to case your apartment to see if it's a good target or anything. You were just thrown by a question you wouldn't normally be asked in that social situation and it took a minute to answer. Given what you've written here I think he was just nervous about his bubble guts and figured a small gamble in asking to do something against policy versus clenching and heading all the way to a cafe from a 4th floor walkup or something. That policy equally protects him from bodily harm, so it wasn't something most people would expect..I think the irritation in his voice came more from \"I gotta take a dump lady!\" (I'm sort of assuming gender tbh) than social engineering/pressure. \n\nHas he been your delivery person for long? Was there something you're not saying in his body language (or maybe not in uniform?) that makes you worried about him delivering to you in the future? If there's other situations and this feels like an escalation it's worth thinking through whether this was an awkward one off or something larger. \n\nIf you realize that you're the frog in the boiling pot and this is the latest in pushing your comfort levels, it could definitely be a lower-stakes way to report inappropriate behavior.", "YWBTA.

He asked politely. You said no. He thanked you and left.\n\nYTA.", "Yes bro you already said no. This is a simple interaction with a stranger and someone who mightve just been needing the bathroom. You must dwell on alot of things huh?", "YWBTA\n\nAsking to go to the bathroom is a pretty normal interaction. He asked, you said no. He thanked you and left. \n\nWhy do you need to think more on it and want to report him to make him lose his job? \n\nThis is a tough job, and a lot of the times they are only fixated in getting to the address in the shortest time, and not so much happily looking around and noting the shops around them.", "YWBTA. He need a bathroom, asked politely, and left when you said no. You have no reason to dump on him.", "Yes you would be the asshole. You said no and he went away. Why are you still on this. Nothing happened", "Yta he just needed the bathroom and left when you said no", "YTA. It would be different if he got angry when you said no, but he thanked you and left.", "YWBTA if you reported him.\n\nI've worked in the freight industry and the toilet provisions for drivers are abysmal. This is specific to my country so not necessarily the same as where you are.\n\nDepending on where these drivers are collecting packages from, they might not even have access to a toilet when they start work in the morning if they're collecting parcels from local businesses. They're not supposed to refuse a request from a driver to use the toilet, but many still do. Usually the people delivering to your house will be different than the ones collecting from local businesses, except if the company is short staffed (which is fairly likely.) \n\nHGV drivers are expected to take breaks from driving so can plan to stop at service stations during their journey. Drivers of smaller vans that deliver to houses are given routes that they need to stick to, otherwise they probably won't be paid if they go off route and end up doing overtime, and nobody wants to do work they're not being paid for (again, not sure on the legality of that but it happens.) Coffee shops usually only allow customers to use their toilet, so he'd need to spend time buying a coffee or something, which can take a while if they're busy. Also, it's likely they're using a company GPS so might not indicate shops in the same way Google maps does.\n\nThis type of work can be very common with people with social anxiety or poor social skills since you're on your own most of the time.\n\nThe decision whether or not to allow someone into your home is up to you, so it's okay if you refused his request. I'm just saying it's possible that he did simply want to use the toilet and chose to ask you for the reasons above, and not because it was something sinister.\n\nEdit: Also, bear in mind that whenever you order something online, lots of people see your name and address, there'll be several admin staff, several warehouse staff and at least two drivers. Depending on the item you've ordered it can be pretty easy to take a guess about your age/gender (warehouses generally get the same sort of freight, so the staff get used to what's coming in and recognise things just from the shape/colour of boxes etc., there doesn't have to be any text on the boxes detailing what's inside.)", "Yes, you would. He wasn't rude or anything and probably didn't wanna take the extra stop, wasting 5 minutes and get behind his delivery times.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say NTA. Delivery drivers should never ask to go into someone's home to use the bathroom. I guarantee you that it is against company policy because it creates a horrendous risk for the company. The fact that he would ask is extremely weird and unprofessional. Especially when he got irritated with you and pressured you to answer. There is something not right about that interaction.", "NTA all these other voters must live in Mr. Roger\u2019s neighborhood bc in the real world you don\u2019t do this, ESPECIALLY when public options are readily available. And this just happened to be a man, if a woman asked my answer would be the same. And honestly it could be a real issue for the company (the customer could have a legitimate or fake complaint) or the man himself (even if he\u2019s a saint, he\u2019s asking to go in a stranger\u2019s house) so really that boundary protects everyone. The reality check could just as easily keep HIM out of danger. \n\nI will change my answer if he works for Amazon. That company treats their employees horribly and they probably aren\u2019t allowed bathroom breaks and the gps is probably tracked bc they\u2019re monsters who want to use every second their employees exist. So if it was Amazon then leave the man alone. He hasn\u2019t gone pee in like a week probably.", "Soft YTA. \n\nIt could be that he genuinely needed the bathroom but didn't know about the bathrooms located nearby. He just was not very polite to ask to use ur bathroom so maybe he was urgent. I mean, he immediately backed off after you mentioned there were other bathrooms nearby? So maybe he was urgent to use the bathroom.\n\nBut, it's understandable that it's scary to let a complete stranger in your house use the bathroom. So in a way, it's good that you didn't let him in?\n\nI don't think he would be fired simply because he just asked to use the bathroom if you called them up anyway.\n\nIt really just sounds like a normal interaction: he genuinely needed the bathroom and didn't know where else to look.", "Tricky one! \n\nDepending where you are (in Australia?

I had the local Fastrack guy fuck up on a parcel, swear black and blue he\u2019d delivered something into my letterbox (which there\u2019s zero possibility it\u2019d fit!) and forever after I made every effort to never, ever, get something delivered by Fastrack, and the one occasion he was supposed to deliver he didn\u2019t knock, he didn\u2019t even come to my place, he just made my parcel be \u2018collection from delivery centre\u2019.

I don\u2019t know why you want him to be fired over this. \n\nSometimes you drink that extra coffee cause wow you\u2019re tired but Owh does it make you need to go suddenly, and so he asked\u2026 you said no, it was done. He thanked you after getting directions, it\u2019s quite possible he was thinking \u2018need to pee need to pee, get this delivery done, omg I can\u2019t hold it. Ask, ok no worries I\u2019ll go where you said\u2019. \n\nI\u2019m all about safety but why ruin his life for this", "YWBTA\n\nNot for denying the bathroom use. I don't blame you for not wanting a stranger in your house. But all he did was ask and besides that he was polite.", "YTA.  He asked, you declined, he left.  Maybe he was a little brusque because he was absolutely desperate to go.  To then try and get him into trouble with his employer is seriously AH behaviour.", "YWBTA. \n\nGuy asked, you said no, guy left. Weird, but no hassling. \n\nConsider this scenario: you\u2019re at gas station, guy walks up and asks you out, you say no, he leaves. Weird maybe, but accepts your answer and leaves with no hassling. Not a creeper. \n\nAny amount of not accepting your answer or arguing or lingering around or trying to negotiate for your particular bathroom or of hassling you in general when you said no would instantly change the situation. But from what you said, he just left. \n\nI\u2019d just let it go.", "YTA if you report him. He asked, you said no and he left. Those drivers get times on their deliveries. He may not have felt he had time to find an open business and park etc. I can understand not letting him in but why would you report him when he left?", "NTA - as someone who formerly worked in transportation and logistics, it's very much against most delivery companies policies for delivery drivers to ever enter a residence. There are so many liability issues. The driver should be aware of those policies. Filing a complaint about the driver would be appropriate. In most cases that I've witnessed, the driver will receive a reminder of company rules.", "YTA I\u2019ve let strangers use my bathroom, am still alive. You said No and you still want to be a jerk about it. Chill.", "NTA for saying no, but a mega AH if you think that he could get fired over a simple question and decided to report him. He might have kids, he might have a UTI or IBS, his curtness could be autism, you don\u2019t know anything about him except he delivered your shit. What the hell is wrong with this planet?", "I'm not sure why everyone is voting YTA. Have we not heard of home invasions, assault, and rape? It is completely inappropriate to even ask someone to use their bathroom if you are delivering a package. The driver should have made a pit stop. The fact that the driver was aggressive makes it even more potentially dangerous.", "OP is the dude that drops his phone when someone asks him for the time.", "It\u2019s quite normal for delivery drivers to ask if they are desperate. They spend their entire shift driving around there are no toilets in their van. They also can\u2019t go off route as they have to delivered a certain amount of packages in their shift. My mum was a driver and she would try to plan going to business when she delivered, but sometimes she never delivered to any and if she was ready to burst she\u2019d have to ask people. Men she worked with would bring bottles with them to piss in them or they would have to pee in a bush. Its a shitty job and sometimes they gotta take any toilet they can get.", "Public options aren't always readily available and take a lot of extra time. Here in the Netherlands delivery people are paid for the amount of packages that they drop of in a timeslot. That means that any delay cost them their income. So it will cost them less time and thus less money when they are able to use a customers toilet if nothing else is on their route", "I am a female and I say YTA. It\u2019s fine she didn\u2019t let him in but he accepted it and left. Why get the guy in trouble?", "Maybe. I would be. I wouldn't let use my toilet for that reason. That's my toilet which i keep clean not for strangers to use! \n\nI wouldn't think of being attacked in OP's case because if he wanted to attack he could do it without asking to use the bathroom . But her feelings are valid. If she values her safety and her clean toilet, that's how it should be! She doesn't owe anything to the delivery guy. She just has to pick up her parcel on time, which she did.", "And the ones that do often demand you buy something.", "Because they are given strict times to deliver a certain amount of parcels and don\u2019t have time to stop somewhere nearby", "In the parallel universe where that happened, OP is asking if they would be TA because the delivery driver was 5 minutes late cause he stopped to pee.", "When i was 12-13 i was riding my bike in the hood as usual. I was close to the river turn when i saw two men from the distance. For some reason i stopped and my heart jumped. I rode back home.\nSometimes the body just screams that something is off with those strangers", "My mums a delivery driver and they will all ask if they desperately need a wee. They have no access to a toilet as soon as they start delivering", "No, you are behaving like some noble worth too much for peasants working for you. \n\nDelivery man asked, delivery man got answer, delivery man went away. Good thing OP isn't scared of wind.", "Yeah, its the power of human brain. Sometimes your brain will analyze the situation and tell you its dangerous. You cant really tell why exactly but its good to listen to your instincts :)", "Come on, there is plenty of public places where you can go instead of asking customer. I understand some emergency can happen with number two, but it also depends on how you deliver the message. The OP had weird vibes from guy and made the right decision to not let him in. If he was nice and polite and no other places around where to go, situation would be different.", "You\u2019re not allowed to leave your route and you have a strict time frame to stick to. My mum has had to pee in bushes before and a lot of men pee in bottles. It\u2019s a shitty job. The guy was likely about to piss himself and that\u2019s why he was so short. Shouldn\u2019t be fired for it be accepted no and left", "Well depends on country and company i guess, like sure this is bad what you said and its mindblowing that person has to pee in bottle and any employer should be punished for having this as norm between employees. But from perspective of customer, its not your problem and to let stranger access your house can result in unwanted situation. Especially as woman to man if you have bad vibe about him. You can use Google and find plenty of cases what happened. Some people are dangerous and you never know what that person will do. Your safety is always priority.", "Your original comment said he shouldn\u2019t even ask. I\u2019m explaining to you why he asked. OP has never said their gender so you are assuming they are a woman. You\u2019re allowed to say no, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask. I\u2019ve already explained going to a public toilet isn\u2019t possible. OP is an AH if they get this person fired for it because this person didn\u2019t try to force their way in or fight over it they just asked and left as soon as they said no. As I\u2019ve already said asking customers is likely is only way to use a toilet without getting in trouble and shouldn\u2019t be punished for asking.", "YWBTA - it's perfectly fine and acceptable to say no when a stranger asks to enter your house, but when you said no and gave instructions of where else to go he thanked you and left. to me that seems like a perfectly normal and respectable conversation and you would be going way overboard to complain to management and probably get him fired. I would just let this rest and forget about it, it's a lot less unnecessary hassle for everyone involved.", "Yea you probably are. It could have been an emergency. Next time hopefully it's you and everyone refuses you... \ud83d\ude43", "So you want to make a complaint to get the guy fired because he dared to ask you if he could use your bathroom? Just for asking? Seriously? You say you got a weird vibe because he was kinda rushed and curt with the way he asked. How is it weird to ask to use someone's bathroom? \n\nINFO: #. 1 Have you never had to \"go\" really badly? 2. Have you never been in a situation where you had to ask to use someone else's? 3. How many delivery companies have you worked for?\n\n>Although, that's a weird request on its own and I'm pretty sure it's against the policy of most delivery companies\n\n>I was thinking of contacting the company and letting them know about the whole interaction, which will probably get the guy fired. But days after, I'm still thinking about it.. it truly made me feel uncomfortable and I'm thinking it's a possible safety concern issue I should inform them about. \n\nThis happened days ago but you're still fixated on it? If it's getting to you so badly I say you call the company to let them know that one of their drivers made you uncomfortable because he had to urinate and that's a possible safety concern that they should take care of immediately! If they don't already have a policy about this they need to make one asap. No more making \"weird requests\" to the people they are delivering items to, ie: asking to urinate in their bathrooms. And from this point further, due to safety concerns all delivery drivers must stop urinating! \n\nYTA. For still thinking about it and wanting to call his bosses to try to get him in trouble. Seriously it's not that deep. You're trying to make more out I this than there is. Are you always this dramatic?", "you can\u2019t be serious. get your head outta your ass.", "Lol loving all the comments calling OP the AH, I know she wasn't expecting that", "Public options were available. So even with that point he shouldn\u2019t have asked. And that may be a cultural difference between your country and mine. In my country they go into schools and shoot our kids. So some caution is smart. Idk if OP is in the US so idk the culture around it in her area, so I\u2019m willing to be wrong there. But regardless, it\u2019s a liability. He\u2019s taking on risks he shouldn\u2019t for himself and his company. He\u2019s welcome to take that risk but there may be consequences. One being that being approached like that at their home may make the customer uncomfortable, which is still valid. \n\nTo me, the only people who are in the wrong are the employers if that\u2019s why he asked. Guilt tripping people into \u201cbeing nice\u201d for strangers has put a lot of people in bad situations. I wouldn\u2019t call unless it became a repeated problem personally but i think it\u2019s a valid complaint. I\u2019m usually the type to take the over-worked employee\u2019s side and i think kindness is necessary and important. But do not ask to enter a stranger\u2019s home unless it\u2019s life or death. I don\u2019t necessarily feel he was wrong, but i do feel like it\u2019s kind of a gray area where both people just have to do what feels best for them (as long as he legitimately just desperately needed a bathroom).", "This^^", "Telling tehm no is not a problem, from what I understand, but potentially getting them fired seems a bit over the top (unless there is further information that I am not aware of).", "NTA", "YTA. he asked, you answered. I don\u2019t understand what your issue is.", "Bro people act funny when they are having a bathroom emergency. Time is of the essence. A deer in the headlights response is not helping him at all.", "Making someone lose their job is no good", "There is absolutely No valid reason for a delivery driver to ask to use your restroom. They know it's against policy.  It's possible that he really needed to go. It's also possible that he was wanting to case your home. It's also possible that he was a predator looking for an opportunity.\n\nPersonallly, I believe you have an obligation to report it, just in case it's the latter reason.\n\nNTA if you do, Y T A if you don't.", "He asked me for the time because he said his phone died and I told him no because I didn\u2019t feel safe looking down for a second at my watch. Should I report him?"]}
