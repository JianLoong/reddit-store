Her boyfriend is rather lazy and does the bare minimum, basically works 30 hours a week and sleeps or plays on his phone the rest of the time.  Any home or car maintenance is usually done by myself or my husband.  My BFF also works about 30 hours a week but does all the housework and child care.  \n\nThey were both laid off during COVID and didn't pay any rent or put anything aside from stimulus money (rather they spent it on frivolous items).  Well once things started back getting normal again they started paying rent but kind of ignored the 16 months they didn't pay.  Again spending whatever extra they had on unnecessary stuff.  Well she recently got a letter of eviction giving her till the 15th of next month to vacate.  Both my husband and myself have encouraged her to talk with landlord, seek help from family, talk with county, and even talk to legal aid.  She has done none of this and instead decided to drink and bury her head in the sand.\n\nNow she has mentioned moving in with me and my family (husband, daughter 17, and son 13).  As much as I'd love to help her I just can't.  I am a neat freak - she is not, my kids attend school regularly - her's miss a lot, my 17yo works a lot on top of school - her 20yo lays in bed all day doing nothing but smoking pot (legal here) and having guys over.  Lastly she has lots of pets and I mean lots 13 dogs and 14 cats.  I have my own hobby farm but they are well kept after and cleaned up after, her's are not as much and there is often messes around the house.\n\nSo would I be the asshole to leave her, her family, and her pets to be homeless?  I have offered to go with her to talk to organizations but again she is just ignoring it all.", "created_utc": 1694799182, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jjlak/wibta_to_not_let_my_best_friend_of_many_years/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is deeply irresponsible, and it shouldn't be you who deals with those consequences. She has options, she's just choosing the easiest one for her. Even just the humans moving in would be insane, and I wanna bet you'd end up doing the chores along with your husband, without help from anyone else.\n\nAlso, 13 dogs and 14 cats in a small apartment? WTF? That's insane.\n\nYou can't let this person encroach in your life anymore than she already has. Her suggestion to move in with you under this circumstances (when it's not even the last resort) is selfish.", "NTA.\n\nTaking in \\*6\\* additional people isn't the solution.

You don't have to take them in, and contrary to what she thinks, that would be a disaster for everyone.\n\nYou should also expect this to be the end of your friendship, she's going to blame you for everything when you say \"No, you can't move in here\".", "Let her know that if she's expecting you to take her in that you aren't prepared to do that, but you can go and talk to legal aid with her. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

From what you said, they've wasted their money and put themselves into this situation.  Either of them can get a 2nd job, everyone is hiring, and work hours and pay the landlord back.  They'll eat all your food and not replace it.  DON'T DO IT!", "NTA. You have helped her, you provided resources and options she did have. \"You may not move in with me. Your options are to talk to these organizations and/or your landlord or vacate the premises but you cannot move in with my family.\" \n\nAlso, FWIW having that many pets is likely against her lease and if the landlord found out, could be evicting her for that reason alone. Also, depending on local jurisdiction, could be against local code as well without some kind of license.", "You can't help people who won't help themselves.  I know it's hard, but it's true.

You are not responsible for her, and helping her as much as you have is already very kind of you. If she wants a partner that can help her, she needs to divorce her deadbeat husband and find one. Also, 13 dogs and 14 cats? In a three bedroom? There\u2019s no way all of those animals are getting their needs met. That is a hoarding situation. I would reconsider this friendship entirely based on that alone.", "NTA.  You need to immediately disabuse her of this notion she has that you and your husband are going to allow them to move in.  Get her sober and let her know.", "NTA Letting her in will not be an opportunity to get her life together; it will ruin yours and I\u2019m sure it will be quite difficult getting them back out.

They (her/BF/oldest child) did this to themselves, they need to work full time and possibly get second jobs to get caught up.  It was not just out of the blue they were evicted.

Do not do this to your children.", "Nta, they have 4 possible income earners in their household and choose to be irresponsible. It is not your problem to feel bad for not opening your home to a very horrible situation that will end up happening if you did.

They could probably use the stability.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m not sure what state you are in but there are state programs that help with back rent from Covid times (paid directly to landlord but tenant has to apply for it). She needs to look into something like that or see if she can work out a payment plan. \n\nShe and her husband sound pretty irresponsible and it\u2019s not up to you to pick up the pieces. She needs to stop the drinking and help herself.", "NTA - you would be an AH to inflict that clusterfuck of a household on your family. The 20-year-old can get a job and her own place. Your friend needs to deal with the rest by being an actual adult. I would, for their sake, ask if there's any way you could help with the animals.

Her place is probably condemned at this point.", "NTA your primary responsibility is to your own family. Nothing good will come of letting 3 lazy negligent adults & 3 minors into your home.

In my state, landlords must first give a notice to quit (by a certain date).  A lot of people mistake this notice for an eviction - legally, it is not.\n\nIf the tenant doe not leave, the LL next has to go to court and get a court date, which will result in a Summons to Court being issued to the tenant.  Next, on the court date, if the judge agrees with the LL, the judge issues an actual Eviction Notice that gives the tenants 14 days min to leave.", "Let her.

She was getting assistance but the landlord wouldn't fix the leaking roof (very bad leaking roof) so assistance would not pay their portion and offered to move or not give her assistance.  She chose the later for reasons I explained.  I do feel bad as she has helped me through some tough times but I just can't see all of them moving in here.  Honestly we can't afford it as my husband's company has been doing on again off again lay offs and I was injured in an accident and been off work for 7 weeks now and will be longer.", "Your friend has serious problems that you absolutely cannot help her with even if you wanted to. As someone else here stated, don\u2019t set yourself (and your family) on fire to keep someone else warm. Especially when that someone will sit by the campfire and not shed a tear for your sacrifice.
