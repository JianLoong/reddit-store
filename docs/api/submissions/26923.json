Her boyfriend is rather lazy and does the bare minimum, basically works 30 hours a week and sleeps or plays on his phone the rest of the time.  Any home or car maintenance is usually done by myself or my husband.  My BFF also works about 30 hours a week but does all the housework and child care.  \n\nThey were both laid off during COVID and didn't pay any rent or put anything aside from stimulus money (rather they spent it on frivolous items).  Well once things started back getting normal again they started paying rent but kind of ignored the 16 months they didn't pay.  Again spending whatever extra they had on unnecessary stuff.  Well she recently got a letter of eviction giving her till the 15th of next month to vacate.  Both my husband and myself have encouraged her to talk with landlord, seek help from family, talk with county, and even talk to legal aid.  She has done none of this and instead decided to drink and bury her head in the sand.\n\nNow she has mentioned moving in with me and my family (husband, daughter 17, and son 13).  As much as I'd love to help her I just can't.  I am a neat freak - she is not, my kids attend school regularly - her's miss a lot, my 17yo works a lot on top of school - her 20yo lays in bed all day doing nothing but smoking pot (legal here) and having guys over.  Lastly she has lots of pets and I mean lots 13 dogs and 14 cats.  I have my own hobby farm but they are well kept after and cleaned up after, her's are not as much and there is often messes around the house.\n\nSo would I be the asshole to leave her, her family, and her pets to be homeless?  I have offered to go with her to talk to organizations but again she is just ignoring it all.", "created_utc": 1694799182, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jjlak/wibta_to_not_let_my_best_friend_of_many_years/", "score": 780, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their situation is the result of their actions.", "That\u2019s not \u2018a lot of pets.\u2019  That\u2019s HOARDING.  There is no landlord in their right mind who would want to keep them.  They need to figure this out without destroying your life.  And they WOULD destroy your life.  NTA", "NTA... Tell her absolutely not and tell her NOW. You are there to help gove her phone numbers to social services only. \n\nIt wouldnt work, youd just lose your home, relationships, money, belongings and then everyone would be worse off. It would be cheaper to rent her a hotel room for a few weeks. Cash so that they are responsible for damages", "Soooo NTA. I don\u2019t know about in your state, but in some, once a person has lived at a residence for a certain length of time, it is a major PITA to get them evicted if they refuse to leave on their own. I could totally see this rather lazy lot being that kind of tenant.\n\nAlso, ask yourself if you are capable of supporting 4 more dependents and their 27 pets, because that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing.", "NTA, she\u2019s delusional.  They will never move out if you let them in!!  Lock your doors and get a security system or cameras and please don\u2019t vacate your home for an extended period of time.", "She has 13 dogs and 14 cats?? Is this even real?? Call the Humane Society or the equivalent first, and get those animals to safety. If this is real, do not let that whole lot into your home. Absolutely No. The adults are clearly fine with waiting for everyone else to save them, and ignore reality.", "NTA. They need to sort themselves out, and this might be the pressure point to do it.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYou aren\u2019t leaving her to be homeless! You already do her house and car maintenance\u2026. And now she is hoping you\u2019ll solve her current problem too.   \n\n\nShe\u2019s making decisions that are leading to her becoming homeless.

She\u2019s got a 20yr old\u2026 so she\u2019s not a young adult. Her kids can work and pay for things. Her BF can. She has 27 four legged animals \u2026. Holy hell.

Unless you have a mansion, adding 6 people and 27 animals to your home would be insane.  \n\nShe needs to deal with her own problems, like having her 20 yr old find his own place.  And both of them need to look into 2nd jobs if they can't afford what they had.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s way too many pets! Could you call animal control for them? Or help rehome them?", "YWBTA if you let them move in. It will drastically have negative effects on your own home and family. Your friend and her family need a hard wake up call. If you give them an easy way out of consequences, it takes away the opportunity they have to learn to be better people.\n\nWhy are you friends?", "NTA you won't be leaving them homeless, THEY ARE.", "Why be BFF with this person?  Sounds like disaster.", "If you let them in I can pretty much guarantee they will never leave\n\nNTA but honestly does she bring anything to this friendship?", "i mean she screams messy household out loud. i would not take them in. especially the lazy bf. NTA", "NTA- You have to look at this backwards: if you do let them move in, how do you get them out again? If there a viable plan that you can believe they will stick to that gets them to their own place on a reasonable timescale? At the moment you're saying you can't see a way to more than double the size of the household and make it work. If you do let them move in and all your concerns are valid, you're then in the position of being the one forcing them out of the place they are living. Possibly by literally packing their stuff up around them and putting it on the lawn. Stick to not being TA for saying no, not being TA for kicking them out a year down the line will be way more stressful.", "It sounds like no matter what you do it would never be enough.  It appears that she believes the world owes her.  A 20 should be contributing to the household.  The number of animals is crazy if you are not working a full time job, how do expect to feed then along with the humans in the home.  Your friend has chosen not to be proactive or even reactive, I hate to say this but some people need to hit rock bottom before they get themselves moving in the right direction.", "I would probably ignore her for a few years- why start something you know you can\u2019t cope with? \nShe and her family are impossible- just say a definite - NO- with no guilt, no explanations, no listening to her- just say no- and walk away. Under no circumstances let her into your home- get security cameras,etc- whatever you have to do to protect your home", "This situation is a dire warning that a tidal wave of bs had you in its sights. Get out of the way and save your family while you can. Don\u2019t cave. Don\u2019t pause. This will ruin you if you don\u2019t say no.", "Nta. This is the bed she made. This is the life she CHOOSES. You cant force her to change. But you also cant be expected to burn down your own house to save hers.", "NTA. Your BFF sounds trashy. Your friendship would be ruined if you enabled her and moved them all in. That would be insane. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. Once they set foot over the threshold you will never get rid of them. Six extra people not to mention all the animals. Can you genuinely see them paying their way with all the bills? Not a chance! You are not making them homeless if you don't do it. They have brought this on themselves.", "I wouldn\u2019t let her. She has proved that she nor anyone else in the family cares about bills or taking care of things. You wouldn\u2019t be able to get them out and your friends ship probably wouldn\u2019t not last. \n\nYour family would be out out and have to deal with the drama. You also don\u2019t want a 20 stinking up the house with pot and having strangers over. That\u2019s not something you want around your kids and who knows if they would steal.( friend\u2019s daughter hookups)", "I work for a nonprofit that is specific to helping people experiencing homelessness. You will be doing her no help if you let them move in. She has multiple issues here: a 20 year old lying around smoking pot and not contributing to a household clearly in need, a boyfriend who is no better and an actual animal hoarding problem. She is going to have to deal with these things and if you let her move in, you are only delaying the inevitable and harming your family in the process. \n\nI was a lifeguard for a long time through school, and one of the things they teach you is that a drowning person can be dangerous in their desperation. They may try to grab you to feel more safe but in such a way that now both of you are drowning. To ameliorate this, they teach you how to go under water and push the drowning person off, and try again to help them safely. As a last resort, you are taught to back off and tread water until they tire enough that you can safely complete the rescue. This is a metaphor for life and helping people. You cannot let someone drowning take you down with them. It does no good and now there are two victims. Tell her no, so she can start the process of putting her life back together. You are not responsible for your friend, as much as you may love her.", "Woah! 13 dogs and 14 cats? Who does that?\n\nNTA\n\nIt's not your fault your friend is a mess. Keep in mind that you might need to draw boundaries and cut her off.", "NTA your first responsibility is to your children. Their well-being comes before your best friend. Do not let her move in with her family. It will be a train wreck.", "NTA. It will wreck your mental health, put a big strain on your family amd eventually ruin your friendship if she moves in.", "Could you imagine living with all those animals never mind the lazy people also. Do not let them move in you will never get rid of them. Let her sort her own life out it\u2019s not your job.", "NTA. Sod that\u2026 you\u2019d be a fool to allow them even one night in your home.

OP, make it VERY clear to her that they can't stay with you.

Don't let them stay for a single night.", "yeah they seem so\u2026opposite to be bffs?", "This is what I'm thinking. 27 animals? Wtf!!", "If she looks it up, these types of people will want OP to fill out the application then guilt her if she says no. This is \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" and the only way to deal with toxic people trying to use you is start saying flat-out no. Don't get on the ride. \n\nSome shelters or groups charge surrender fees for pets. If OP looks up the service, they will expect her to pay. They will just refuse of it costs money otherwise. Then, feeling guilty about these pets, OP will pay fees for every one of those animals. \n\nNope on out of there like there's a rocket on your back, please.", "No no no. Do not help with the animals. They will get more and ask you to care for them. The animals are probably feral or poorly behaved bc no training. Get a rescue involved. This is not OP's problem. She already admitted to being way too accommodating, feeling guilty saying no to her friend, and making up excuses. None of these are healthy. \n\nJust say no. They need to learn that choices have consequences", "I\u2019m stealing this phrase", "I wish awards were still a thing because that phrase alone deserves all the gold on Reddit.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "And they will destroy her house, family and marriage", "No way should you subject your family and yourself to that fiasco.

Your answer is a NO WAY", "Tell her to enjoy that car ride then. \n\nHonestly, what do you get out of this \"friendship\"?", "guess she\u2019s going to live in a car then\u2026", "I have just one dog and between food, treats, and medicine, he's quite a bit older so he has arthritis, making his medicine most of the cost.  I probably spend about $300 a month, then throw in grooming 4 times a year, it all adds up.  \n\nI can't imagine having more than 2 animals.", "besides all the pets who in thier right mind would let a literal farm into their house and the kids on top and the two lazy parents????", "Why is she a friend?  It appears you have different values.", "OP said the BFF's family lives in a three-bedroom house, not an apartment.", "You\u2019re still making excuses \u201cI can\u2019t afford it\u201d. Just say no. You don\u2019t need a reason. You can do it!", "The reality is your friend needs to get on birth control and relinquish almost all of her pets.
