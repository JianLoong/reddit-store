I would be LIVID if any of my employees were being this shady. It\u2019s not only bad of that person, but it shines a bad light on the business. You\u2019re not the only one this person is doing it to so this should be reported. Honestly I would record the entire situation next time and then bring it to the owner as proof", "Just tell him next time: I see you overcharged again, I don't want to have this discussion every time, so from now on I will not tip if you overcharge, so the costs come down the same for me.", "NTA and stop allowing for the double charge. The next time it happens call the manager over. The bartender really is stealing from you and you need to explain that to the manager, they will fix that real quick. How many other people are being over charged? Those are fraudulent charges.", "NTA. Just tell him to remove the overcharge AND don't tip. He'll learn the lesson the soon enough. It's your money, and this is not ok, so why would you tip them at all after this happened so many times?", "NTA, why would you tip someone for stealing from you", "If it's happened a few times and he knows about it, get him to fix and don't tip. He'll learn pretty quick to charge correctly.", "What the hell. \n\nI would be physically incapable of not saying something. \n\nBut NTA, obviously.", "NTA\nIf it were up to me, I\u2019d have a little chat with whoever is in charge because overcharging customers is not right", "Former bar manager here.. not sure how this would work with a fancy pos system or whatever high tech shit places are using now but I can\u2019t tell you how many bartenders I\u2019ve fired for over charging customers and pocketing the money. They\u2019d charge double prices for singles, top shelf price for low ball shots, etc but they\u2019d ring it in as regular price and pocket the difference from the total to count towards their tips.\n\nEdit to add: NTA. If she hasn\u2019t learned how to properly ring in customers by now, she\u2019s either doing it purposely or she\u2019s in the wrong industry.", "NTA\n\nBut you should point it out for two reasons:\n\n1. So it\u2019s clear that you are, in fact, tipping.\n\n2. So their recorded stock levels aren\u2019t out.", "NTA. In simple words, you don't have to tip when you don't want to.", "NAH. You\u2019re well within your rights not to tip but the basis of your logic is where I\u2019m not on board. You can\u2019t swap a tip (that goes directly to the server) with an overcharge (that goes to the bar). The better thing would be to point out the mistake yet again (even if it\u2019s frustrating) and then decide whether or not you want to tip.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t want to tip due to the poor service, I can understand that.

I would email mngmt if possible.", "Definitely mention that to a manager/owner as that is a big mistake to be making on their end, also this overcharge would likely not go toward tips and would just go toward the bar instead", "I guess I haven't considered it that way, and I don't really know the owner. But this is a good point. I'll see if I can bring it up without stirring up too much crap.", "But is the bartender being shady?  The overcharge is in the POS, which means that money is in the owner\u2019s pocket, not the bartender\u2019s.  Sounds more like the bartender is struggling with the POS, which would be easy to do with the terrible setup OP mentioned on the POS system.", "I hear you, but the issue is it's a small place, the bartender is usually the only front of house person there. There's someone in the kitchen also, but there's not really a manager person.", "This", "Honestly, this should be brought up to management if it's a regular occurrence with one particular person. For all they know, this new bartender is ringing in an extra 6 pack, having OP pay for it, then sending it home with friends or taking it themselves at the end of the night. Or even deleting the charge but keeping the difference to make more money. I've been a bartender long enough to have seen quite a few tricks.\n\nIf it's an honest mistake, management will make sure the new guy is trained better. If not, they can keep an eye on shady practices. \n\nNTA", "Ok, let's say I get a burger, two beers on tap, and a six pack to go. All the other bartenders charge me just that. This person charges me for a burger, two beers on tap, and TWO six packs to go. Every single time. So no, it's not a one off or some sort of off premise charge, otherwise it would be consistent across bartenders.", "Yeah it doesn\u2019t matter if you know him, trust me, most small business owners care and image/word of mouth is HUGE to them. Even if the person gets fired that\u2019s not your fault ok? What they are doing is extremely illegal and you are doing the business a very large kindness I promise you that", "I think it\u2019s very reasonable to talk to the manager or the owner about the issue, but I can\u2019t believe the bartender is being shady.  If the payment system is set up as badly as you\u2019ve described, he probably can\u2019t see all the items either.  It\u2019d be a right pain to not be able to quickly check a ticket before asking for payment.  I suspect it\u2019s an honest mistake, after all that money is ending up in the owner\u2019s pocket, not the bartender\u2019s.\n\nApproach it as the POS system seems to have issues, you can\u2019t see your own tab, and this overcharging issue keeps happening, and you\u2019ll be doing everyone a favor.", "Management works as well. Just ask to speak to the manager.", "It can be shady all right. They over charge, then delete the extra 6 pack before fully closing out the bill and pocket the difference. So, not necessarily true that the money goes to the owner. Of course, not necessarily true that the bartender is being shady either.", "Or they're just taking home the extra 6 pack."]}
