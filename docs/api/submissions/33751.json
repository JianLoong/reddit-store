My 20 living close family members (brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews) have stayed with us from the 18th and will continue to until tomorrow. A further eight people joined us yesterday for Christmas dinner and a Christmas party.\n\nMy older brother (40M) and his husband (53M) usually help me with the Christmas dinner and they did this year as well but there were a few more guests than usual and we needed more hands on deck so I asked my younger sister (30F) to help. She agreed, if reluctantly, once she saw how much needed to be done and got to work.\n\nShe muttered when she started that I had better pay her back for this, to which I laughed because I thought it was a joke. There is a very high chance that I misinterpreted this because I do have autism and recognising sarcasm is not one of my strong points. But she didn\u2019t object so I took my interpretation as the correct one.I was and am incredibly grateful for her help and thanked her for it many times. Once the cooking was done and the food was served in our dining room, I made sure to mention the contribution that everyone had put in to the meal, by name, as I do every year.\n\nMy sister then, this morning just before she was about to leave (everything packed up in her car, saying goodbyes to everyone), asked me how much I was going to pay her. I asked her what she meant and she said that she had agreed to do it with the idea that she would be paid for it and she wasn\u2019t my slave. I said I wasn\u2019t going to pay her because it was a favour. Also, I\u2019ve done a lot for her during her time here so if anything, it was her paying me back. She just glared at me and asked again for her money and I said I don\u2019t have anything for her.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask again and left after telling me I was being pissy with her for no reason. We\u2019re normally on very good terms so this was surprising - I don\u2019t remember us ever arguing before now so I think I either did something very wrong or she was in a bad mood because she was hung over and I only did something slightly wrong.

I feel that everyone should contribute in some way when it comes to family gatherings. In this case OP had help but needed more and asked sister to step up. If sister really was expected to be paid, she shouldn't have helped without finalizing how much she'd be paid. She'd be an TA for this though because in my family we usually don't pay each other for helping out unless it's their profession e.g. going to aunt's clinic, hiring second cousin to be MUA for an event etc. \n\nBtw, why is poo mode activates for AITA posts?", "NTA\n\nBut why not follow through.

I think it's perfectly normal to expect people to be willing to help out here and there when they're are a guest at a family dinner / celebration... or even if just a guest at one. You were hosting the dinner for free, and I assume everyone who stayed with you from the 18th on (was your sister included in this) was staying for free, all meals included and everything. \n\nThat said, if your sister truly hates helping that much, perhaps amongst your large group there are one or two others who may have been better about pitching in without complaint and in thanks for all the hard work you've done as a host.", "NTA.  The usual state of affairs is that people pitch in around large holiday events to help the host - whether they are friends or family.  I had some friends around for Xmas dinner and some of them helped me clean up, do you seriously think I offered them time and a half for holiday pay... especially after I cooked a huge meal at my own monetary and muscle expense? No.  Of course not. It is also not your fault that you did not recognize it as genuine, this was so far outside the norm that she needed to be absolutely explicit if this was her request.\n\nI would send her an invoice detailing her portion of the cost of room and board, the cost of the meal, and your labor for hosting.  Then I'd deduct her pay for the mild assistance she provided and ask her when she's paying you.  And I'd not invite her around to another event I hosted.  But I'm petty like that.

I'd ask one family member who you think will have insight and won't spread it as a rumor.\n\nFor instance, does she feel signaled out and has noticed a pattern in who you ask for help? It doesn't excuse her behavior, but it could help you know how to handle the conversation with her.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Family helps family. \n\nWe stayed at my inlaws on Christmas day/night. Me and hubby helped get stuff ready, helped put the food out, helped clean up etc. God even our 6yo helped hand out gifts and collect all of the rubbish. There were only 14 people and we still helped.\n\nToday (boxing day) we were at my mums house. I helped her get some food ready, me and hubby set the table, we helped pack up etc. There were 5 of us. Oh! And my hubby moved some heavy stuff around for my mum and sister. \n\nYou help each other at times like this. I'd never expect my family to pay me if we help them.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is out of her mind with ingratitude. Tell her you deducted the price of her food and room for 9 nights from her wages and there was nothing left over. \n\nOn a more serious note you can point out that she had no intention of paying *you* for the work if she hadn't helped out, so she can't then expect *you* to pay *her*. You have been providing room and board for her (and 27 other people!) for several days, so her helping out for one meal is literally the least she could do. You shouldn't even have had to ask.

In our family it's always been all hands on deck to get Christmas dinner ready at a reasonable time. Even as a 10 year old I was expected to help with the easier tasks.

It's only good manners to help out when the hosts are struggling.", "You're NTA. Even a 5  year old kid knows everyone should pitch in at a family meal and no one gets paid. How did your sister make it to **30 years old** without realizing she should pull her weight?", "NTA your sister is an ass! Who charges family to help out during the holidays, especially when she was staying in your house and eating your food?!?! Additionally, she knows you are autistic so she should\u2019ve made it clear to you from the very beginning - she knew that what she was asking for was ridiculous. Lastly, she isn\u2019t 14, she\u2019s 30 years old! That is way too old to expect payment and create this drama. Don\u2019t pay her. Let her pout. She\u2019ll get over it. I would never ask her to help out again though.", "So did she pay for the room she slept in ? The water and electricity she used ? Did she contribute financially to the food and drinks she had during her stay ? \n\nNTA. I don't even get how you have to ask people to help out. Maybe it's a cultural thing but I always ask the hosts if there's anything I can do to help with the cooking and I'm always helping with the clean up. That's basic for me.", "NTA.  Sorry you have an entitled twit for a sister.  Did she pay for any meal? Did she pay for accommodations?  It\u2019s all hands on deck for large family gatherings.  That\u2019s just common sense.

My 20 living close family members (brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews) have stayed with us from the 18th and will continue to until tomorrow. A further eight people joined us yesterday for Christmas dinner and a Christmas party.  \nMy older brother (40M) and his husband (53M) usually help me with the Christmas dinner and they did this year as well but there were a few more guests than usual and we needed more hands on deck so I asked my younger sister (30F) to help. She agreed, if reluctantly, once she saw how much needed to be done and got to work.  \nShe muttered when she started that I had better pay her back for this, to which I laughed because I thought it was a joke. There is a very high chance that I misinterpreted this because I do have autism and recognising sarcasm is not one of my strong points. But she didn\u2019t object so I took my interpretation as the correct one.  \nI was and am incredibly grateful for her help and thanked her for it many times. Once the cooking was done and the food was served in our dining room, I made sure to mention the contribution that everyone had put in to the meal, by name, as I do every year.   \nMy sister then, this morning just before she was about to leave (everything packed up in her car, saying goodbyes to everyone), asked me how much I was going to pay her. I asked her what she meant and she said that she had agreed to do it with the idea that she would be paid for it and she wasn\u2019t my slave. I said I wasn\u2019t going to pay her because it was a favour. Also, I\u2019ve done a lot for her during her time here so if anything, it was her paying me back. She just glared at me and asked again for her money and I said I don\u2019t have anything for her.  \nShe didn\u2019t ask again and left after telling me I was being pissy with her for no reason. We\u2019re normally on very good terms so this was surprising - I don\u2019t remember us ever arguing before now so I think I either did something very wrong or she was in a bad mood because she was hung over and I only did something slightly wrong.

NTA", "NTA Does this person ever host? If so, does she do it all herself, no help from anyone else *at all?* I'm guessing that is a \"No\". Tell her that if her participation is transactional then her attendance is as well and her future buy in for attending xmas is 1/20 (or however many guests) the cost of your labor and food costs for the whole event because if she thinks only her time is worth something she has another thing coming.  \nEd: Do that as a fall back. I'd leave it unless she brings it up again.", "NTA but rather than going all Reddit on her and escalating the bitchiness, why not ask her what's going on with her? Maybe she's experiencing some financial difficulties,  maybe she feels used at these events, maybe she's got something entirely unrelated but highly stressful going on in her life or maybe she's just being a jerk. You won't know until you ask.", "NTA. Send her a request for 8 days of lodging at the local market rate.", "Wtf?! If she ate, THAT was her payment! \n\nNTA, but ew for her behavior", "NTA - it seems you never agreed to pay her. Also she doesn't have a figure of the agreed amount. So I'd say \"sure I'll pat you the amount we agreed on, if you can tell me what it was.\" There wasn't an amount, so no payment due.", "NTA.\n\nDid she stay with you? Then you've paid equally to how much she saved in hotels and sustenance. Which is A LOT for a whole week.", ">Edit: People do help out in other ways, which is why I went to my sister because she was the only one who wasn\u2019t busy\n\nSo this tells me that sister is  spoiled and lazy and believes she is the only one who shouldn't have to help out. Does she think the whole family is supposed to cater to just her? Wow. NTA. Do not pay her.", "Nta, your sister is the one being pissy and rude.  She's a bit hard to take, family usually does do things for Xmas meal...she seems like a rude, ungrateful family member, ask her when she's going to pay you for the room and board while she stayed in your home, if she continues her spoiled ungrateful money demand.", "[removed]", "NTA you hosted her and her family IN your home for how many days and she wants money cause she helped you cook? Imagine the hotel stay charge, plus food (I'm assuming she ate but didn't help pay for), add it all up and send a bill.", "NTA- you hosted everything! And she stayed with you. You already saved her money. And family should help family. In my family, helping the host, whether is cooking or dishes, is a must. It\u2019s how we thank the host.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nYou did not misread anything. 99 out of 100 people would have thought she was joking because the idea that she would expect to be paid for helping out where (1) she is the beneficiary of you hosting her for just over a week, (2) she is the only one not already helping in some form, and (3) there is a lot of work to be done for everyone to enjoy a large family gathering... is just ludicrous.\n\nTake a good look at this sister. Is she generally one to never help, one to expect to benefit from your (or others') efforts without contributing anything herself? If so, it's possible the reason you've gotten along so well historically, is that you've been willing to go along with her demands and expectations. Just a thought for you to consider.\n\nGoing forward, see whether this was an aberration or her true perspective. It sounds like she's not inclined to lift a finger on her own, so I doubt she will initiate an apology for expecting to be paid, much less for not having offered to help to begin with. BUT, if you have a conversation with her... (Does she expect to stay with you for just over a week and enjoy the festivities but not contribute in any way? Does she notice how everyone but her helps in some way?) See what her answers are. Does she acknowledge that people do help, that she should help but then also offer an excuse for herself (e.g., she's tired from her work; she doesn't like or feel comfortable doing the job she was assigned; she didn't expect to have to because she never had to before)? Does she hold firm that it's not her job to help?\n\nIf she acknowledges that she should help, then maybe work with her a little. Ask her what jobs she would like to do as her part of pitching in next gathering. Then you've got an understanding and pre-agreement with her that may make this a non-issue next time.\n\nIf she insists she should not have to do anything, then tell her that she will not be staying with you next gathering. She is welcome to show up on Christmas Day, see everyone, and leave the same day. You gift to her is treating her to the Christmas Day meal and hosting her in your home for that day. You are not obligated to offer her even that, and you certainly aren't going to offer more than that to someone who refuses to lift a finger to pitch in without expecting to be paid.", "NTA this is soo rude of your sister", "Tell her before you pay her you will be deducting your labor, lodging, electricity and food costs that she used.  Then let her know what she owes you .  I'm sorry but I'm a little petty and would let her know that next year she needs to pay upfront for everything I just listed above and if she doesn't let everyone know what a spoiled brat she is.", "I\u2019d give her a bill her for the meal then tell her we\u2019re even on what she earned helping out but she still owes you and the other slaves a tip.", "NTA. Did you sister stay with you? Did you charge her rent?\n\nIf this turns into something serious, try pointing out (1) you paid for most of the food as the host, and (2) it's normal for everyone to pitch in, and that's why everyone did. You could also point out that you didn't charge her money to stay.\n\nWhat's going on with your sister? Is she under some extreme financial stress? Or is she dealing with some long-term issue about being used by family members in some way? It might be worth finding out.\n\nIt's also possible that your sister is just an ass. Also worth knowing for future reference.", "What was your husband doing?", "NTA. You help during Christmas. I bring cinnamon rolls and tidy the breakfast dishes. She can suck it up.", "NTA.\n\nHelping family cook for Christmas dinner is not something one should expect to be paid for.", "NTA you hosted her and her family for Christmas so they didn\u2019t have to pay for a hotel. I would be petty and say fine, show her the typical minimum wage for a line cook for how many hours she helped and then deduct that from the nightly hotel rate for nearby hotels. Then send her a bill for the remaining part she owes you for hosting her in your hotel.", "She stayed at your house for free, I don\u2019t know why she would expect payment for contributing to a family gathering and celebration. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Ask her for lodging costs since it sounds like she just stayed at your home for a week.", "Was the (30f) a typo on the sister? sounds more like (14).\n\nNTA", "I mean, there were like 25 other people sitting on their butts not helping. A good portion were probably kids, I'd be a bit salty if I was literally the only person called out and put to work.\n\nI wouldn't have expected to be paid (thats weird), but singling out one person to put to work is not the way to go.  Either say \"I need someone to do xyz\" and try to get volunteers.  Or spread the work around.", "> Btw, why is poo mode activates for AITA posts?\n\nLook at the stickied mod post in this sub. \"\u201cProctologists Only Orifices\u201d (POO Mode\u2122 for short)\", by the way.", "Tell her she can host next year", "Me too this is good", "Also add room charges plus meal charges for all the meals she ate while staying at her home.", "100%, even if she doesn't actually intend on making her pay. I honestly cannot believe a 30 year old grown woman would act this way and be so oblivious to how rude she's being, especially after all the favors OP has already done for her. I expected a teenager.", "this has to be a joke.", "This person has definitely been taken off the holiday guest list lol.", "It is basic politeness as a guest to offer your host a hand. If you can't handle that, don't  accept offers to be a guest. (From a Midwest US perspective anyway).  This is also a family dinner, not a dinner for acquaintances or a work dinner.   Families pitch in.", "He'll in my family we even make sure the Littles do something.  It may not really be helpful, but it teaches them to be a part of the family and makes them feel like they are contributing.  A 5 yr old can cut out Christmas cookies or help set the table with supervision (if available)", "Different households handle these type of events differently. It's all about the precedent here.", "This is a really weird take. This was not a wedding or a birthday party where your interpretation might at least make some sense. Hosts in those kinds of celebration get gifts from the guests which make up the cost and work a bit while they don't have to give their guests presents in return. \n\nThis was a huge Christmas party where the whole family wanted to meet up and celebrate and OP did everyone a huge favor to provide a place for that and not just for one day, but for a couple of days which many stayed. They should rather pay OP and her husband for all the work, costs and stress instead of demanding money. \n\nWho knows if anyone else was willing to do so much. Without them they might have needed to rent a place and everyone might have needed to pay for hotel rooms for a number of days. The sister helping with dinner is not doing much in comparison and she really should have offered to help on her own for free. \n\nOP is NTA.", "my thought too.  is your sister ASD as well?  cause she is way off social norms to expect to get paid for helping prep a family meal.", "If the sister needs financial help, it's on her to say so, instead of passive-aggressively demanding payment for helping make Christmas dinner.", "[removed]", "The sister is way too old to just now be learning the concept that food/drink/holiday cheer takes real work. How does someone get that old and thinks Christmas is when *everyone else* waits on you.", "Exactly. She should have asked her sister if she enjoyed the food and having a place to sleep. That should have been payment enough...", "At Thanksgiving this year with my family I took over doing the turkey entirely and managed it pretty much top to bottom.\n\nYesterday when at Christmas with my girlfriend's family, her mom wasn't confident on her rib roast so I sous chefed for her and made sure that it came out exactly how she wanted. I also scratch made gravy for them when my gf's dad expressed wanting some.\n\nIt's just...part of the holidays. Everyone pitches in for love of helping everyone out. Demanding to be paid would get you excised from my invite list, for every holiday and party, frankly.", "I think this is the sisters way of saying she wants to host next year with no help from anyone.", "Your sister is a selfish AH.

What a conclusion to come to.", "Where does it say anything in this post about tge girls character?", "Yes, do that - because even at $100/day for room and board, which is a very low rate, (especially with these holiday prices and inflation!), there is no way she contributed $600 worth of labor to the family meal.
