My 20 living close family members (brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews) have stayed with us from the 18th and will continue to until tomorrow. A further eight people joined us yesterday for Christmas dinner and a Christmas party.\n\nMy older brother (40M) and his husband (53M) usually help me with the Christmas dinner and they did this year as well but there were a few more guests than usual and we needed more hands on deck so I asked my younger sister (30F) to help. She agreed, if reluctantly, once she saw how much needed to be done and got to work.\n\nShe muttered when she started that I had better pay her back for this, to which I laughed because I thought it was a joke. There is a very high chance that I misinterpreted this because I do have autism and recognising sarcasm is not one of my strong points. But she didn\u2019t object so I took my interpretation as the correct one.I was and am incredibly grateful for her help and thanked her for it many times. Once the cooking was done and the food was served in our dining room, I made sure to mention the contribution that everyone had put in to the meal, by name, as I do every year.\n\nMy sister then, this morning just before she was about to leave (everything packed up in her car, saying goodbyes to everyone), asked me how much I was going to pay her. I asked her what she meant and she said that she had agreed to do it with the idea that she would be paid for it and she wasn\u2019t my slave. I said I wasn\u2019t going to pay her because it was a favour. Also, I\u2019ve done a lot for her during her time here so if anything, it was her paying me back. She just glared at me and asked again for her money and I said I don\u2019t have anything for her.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask again and left after telling me I was being pissy with her for no reason. We\u2019re normally on very good terms so this was surprising - I don\u2019t remember us ever arguing before now so I think I either did something very wrong or she was in a bad mood because she was hung over and I only did something slightly wrong.

I feel that everyone should contribute in some way when it comes to family gatherings. In this case OP had help but needed more and asked sister to step up. If sister really was expected to be paid, she shouldn't have helped without finalizing how much she'd be paid. She'd be an TA for this though because in my family we usually don't pay each other for helping out unless it's their profession e.g. going to aunt's clinic, hiring second cousin to be MUA for an event etc. \n\nBtw, why is poo mode activates for AITA posts?", "NTA\n\nBut why not follow through.

I think it's perfectly normal to expect people to be willing to help out here and there when they're are a guest at a family dinner / celebration... or even if just a guest at one. You were hosting the dinner for free, and I assume everyone who stayed with you from the 18th on (was your sister included in this) was staying for free, all meals included and everything. \n\nThat said, if your sister truly hates helping that much, perhaps amongst your large group there are one or two others who may have been better about pitching in without complaint and in thanks for all the hard work you've done as a host.", "NTA.  The usual state of affairs is that people pitch in around large holiday events to help the host - whether they are friends or family.  I had some friends around for Xmas dinner and some of them helped me clean up, do you seriously think I offered them time and a half for holiday pay... especially after I cooked a huge meal at my own monetary and muscle expense? No.  Of course not. It is also not your fault that you did not recognize it as genuine, this was so far outside the norm that she needed to be absolutely explicit if this was her request.\n\nI would send her an invoice detailing her portion of the cost of room and board, the cost of the meal, and your labor for hosting.  Then I'd deduct her pay for the mild assistance she provided and ask her when she's paying you.  And I'd not invite her around to another event I hosted.  But I'm petty like that.

I'd ask one family member who you think will have insight and won't spread it as a rumor.\n\nFor instance, does she feel signaled out and has noticed a pattern in who you ask for help? It doesn't excuse her behavior, but it could help you know how to handle the conversation with her.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Family helps family. \n\nWe stayed at my inlaws on Christmas day/night. Me and hubby helped get stuff ready, helped put the food out, helped clean up etc. God even our 6yo helped hand out gifts and collect all of the rubbish. There were only 14 people and we still helped.\n\nToday (boxing day) we were at my mums house. I helped her get some food ready, me and hubby set the table, we helped pack up etc. There were 5 of us. Oh! And my hubby moved some heavy stuff around for my mum and sister. \n\nYou help each other at times like this. I'd never expect my family to pay me if we help them.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is out of her mind with ingratitude. Tell her you deducted the price of her food and room for 9 nights from her wages and there was nothing left over. \n\nOn a more serious note you can point out that she had no intention of paying *you* for the work if she hadn't helped out, so she can't then expect *you* to pay *her*. You have been providing room and board for her (and 27 other people!) for several days, so her helping out for one meal is literally the least she could do. You shouldn't even have had to ask.

In our family it's always been all hands on deck to get Christmas dinner ready at a reasonable time. Even as a 10 year old I was expected to help with the easier tasks.

It's only good manners to help out when the hosts are struggling.", "You're NTA. Even a 5  year old kid knows everyone should pitch in at a family meal and no one gets paid. How did your sister make it to **30 years old** without realizing she should pull her weight?", "NTA your sister is an ass! Who charges family to help out during the holidays, especially when she was staying in your house and eating your food?!?! Additionally, she knows you are autistic so she should\u2019ve made it clear to you from the very beginning - she knew that what she was asking for was ridiculous. Lastly, she isn\u2019t 14, she\u2019s 30 years old! That is way too old to expect payment and create this drama. Don\u2019t pay her. Let her pout. She\u2019ll get over it. I would never ask her to help out again though.", "So did she pay for the room she slept in ? The water and electricity she used ? Did she contribute financially to the food and drinks she had during her stay ? \n\nNTA. I don't even get how you have to ask people to help out. Maybe it's a cultural thing but I always ask the hosts if there's anything I can do to help with the cooking and I'm always helping with the clean up. That's basic for me.", "NTA.  Sorry you have an entitled twit for a sister.  Did she pay for any meal? Did she pay for accommodations?  It\u2019s all hands on deck for large family gatherings.  That\u2019s just common sense.

My 20 living close family members (brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews) have stayed with us from the 18th and will continue to until tomorrow. A further eight people joined us yesterday for Christmas dinner and a Christmas party.  \nMy older brother (40M) and his husband (53M) usually help me with the Christmas dinner and they did this year as well but there were a few more guests than usual and we needed more hands on deck so I asked my younger sister (30F) to help. She agreed, if reluctantly, once she saw how much needed to be done and got to work.  \nShe muttered when she started that I had better pay her back for this, to which I laughed because I thought it was a joke. There is a very high chance that I misinterpreted this because I do have autism and recognising sarcasm is not one of my strong points. But she didn\u2019t object so I took my interpretation as the correct one.  \nI was and am incredibly grateful for her help and thanked her for it many times. Once the cooking was done and the food was served in our dining room, I made sure to mention the contribution that everyone had put in to the meal, by name, as I do every year.   \nMy sister then, this morning just before she was about to leave (everything packed up in her car, saying goodbyes to everyone), asked me how much I was going to pay her. I asked her what she meant and she said that she had agreed to do it with the idea that she would be paid for it and she wasn\u2019t my slave. I said I wasn\u2019t going to pay her because it was a favour. Also, I\u2019ve done a lot for her during her time here so if anything, it was her paying me back. She just glared at me and asked again for her money and I said I don\u2019t have anything for her.  \nShe didn\u2019t ask again and left after telling me I was being pissy with her for no reason. We\u2019re normally on very good terms so this was surprising - I don\u2019t remember us ever arguing before now so I think I either did something very wrong or she was in a bad mood because she was hung over and I only did something slightly wrong.

You host an event that is too big for you to handle. Your siblings were guests and had to help. Yes, it is what \"family \" does. But, maybe they want to enjoy the time as a guest. \nMaybe next year,  hire a few neighbor kids to help.", "NTA. I don't even understand the concept... At Christmas, *everyone* helps out, so that *everyone* can enjoy the festivities. The payment is the finished meal that I'm sure your sister partook in. I can't imagine a majority of the adults in my family just sitting on their asses not helping. Everyone is just in and out of the kitchen, cooking, tidying up, looking after the younger kids... \nRegardless of who's hosting, we all help out. Even me, who's disabled and physically can't help much, I can still do some things that are helpful (such as keeping a few kids entertained with crayons and paper, or holding a baby so the parents can do their things in peace), and I bring stuff I've prepared beforehand. \n\nIf someone demanded to be paid, I'd laugh too. Then we'd probably point out that everyone helps out and everyone has pitched in buying food - why should one person get paid for doing what all of us does to have a nice Christmas together?", "NTA. I'd ask her how much she wanted and tell her I'd deduct it from the rent she owed for staying at my house.", "YTA - If you can afford to host all of those people for that long, you can afford to hire help.", "Nta. I agree with you completely. What is poo mode? What causes poo mode to be activated? I thought it was an aita thing. Lol", "Exactly! Sister was hosted for 8 days for free with all meals and was so ungrateful and lazy she expected to be paid for helping out! What the hell is wrong with some people? NTA Maybe next year her invitation can go missing. I really don't understand people like her! I always offer a hand to my hosts.", "This is the way.  Bet you\u2019ll be ahead by several hundred dollars.  Going rate for each night she stayed + every meal she ate that you provided - min wage for her \u201chelp\u201d = she needs to get a clue.", "I would do exactly the same. NTA.", "Ohhh I absolutely love this!! Do it and let us know her response lmao", "That's petty! But that's totally something I would have said to the sister. OP, NTA, but explain to your sis how much effort you put into the hosting, maybe she sees straight and stops with the nonsense.", "This! Please do this!", " NTA. \nIn a family, I would hope we would all help each other out regardless of the time of year. My mum is stopping with us until New Year, she has pitched in with a few chores, e.g. she does the handwashing up after dinner each year, but the meal prep, cooking and serving is done by my husband and I.\nWe help each other out throughout the year, money only changes hands if costs are incurred.", "This is the key phrase:\n\n- you can point out that she had no intention of paying you for the work if she hadn't helped out, so she can't then expect you to pay her", "OP could send Sis a bill for all the previous years she hosted with no help from Sis. It you're partaking in the meal and the host asks for help (which in my experience they rarely do if unless they really need it) you get off your butt and help. Peel veg, set the table, move in extra chairs. This is basic gratitude, no?", "Yes, it really does suck (pun intended) when the undead drop in...", "Don\u2019t forget to charge for meals!", "This.", "Exactly, say OP could say they took the cost of their meal and board out of their pay for helping out", "Before I went no contact/low contact with much of my family, family holidays in my family were the adult women and teen girls doing everything and the men sitting, snoozing, and watching tv. At Friendsgivings, it's also common for the female guests to help out while the male guests sit and watch football. I'm Gen X and most of my friends are my age and older including boomers but even my millennial friends seem to do a lot more of the cleaning and putting away than their bfs/husbands although some of those millennial men help more with the cooking.", "Exactly this. We had christmas lunch at my sister's. There were 17 of us, including my small niblings. She had to completely transform her living room with these 3 collapsible tables that were arranged in a horseshoe shape to fit us all in.\n\nHer and her partner did the cooking before we all arrived.  I helped with finishing off and serving, clearing plates etc. Then when dinner was over, It was all hands on deck to clear the detritus, collapse and remove the tables, and restore the living room. Even the kids helped. The only one who didn't was my SIL, who is a bit lazy, and my mum who frankly has done her time. It wouldn't cross anyone else's mind to not help, nor would anyone demand payment. \n\nIt took all of 10 mins and we had a really enjoyable day.", "Yeah, I am also confused OP had to explicitly ask for help with 28 family guests around.", "Agreed NTA! Kudos to you OP for hosting that many people successfully. Even when my family goes just to thanksgiving everyone is hanging around asking if they can help - we even have the tradition of assigning jobs through random picking (helping tear down, serving water, serving dessert, washing dishes) - people often do more than their assigned job. \nCrazy to think she\u2019d need to be paid to help out for a meal she participated in.", "Dear Sis, \n\n8 Days \\* $150 rent/day + 8 Days \\* 3 Meals/day \\* $15 cost/meal - 8 days \\* 8 Hrs/day \\* $15/hr = 1200 + 360 - 960 =  $600 is what YOU owe. \n\nPls send $600 money as per the above calculation that you owe me by check/draft/bank transfer/paypal/venmo asap as it will accrue interest at 10%/annum.  Good of you to remind me of this, we will do this next year as well. Next time bring your SO/Children/friends as well, it might turn into a money making machine\n\nRegards OP.", "Oh, I didn't mean only help at Christmas. I meant help at times when it's needed.", "Exactly! It goes much quicker when it's all hands on deck, then everyone can relax and have a good time.", "Precisely! Sure, we might have to ask the teens to help set the table or whatever, but everyone else just helps out. It's stressful enough at Christmas for a large family gathering, even when everyone helps out. Can't imagine how stressful it would be if 25 people just sat and waited like they're at a restaurant? No one volunteered to help? \ud83d\udc40"]}
