When he moved out he worked too much to be able to take good care of one by himself, but when we got together and I eventually moved in with him, we decided to get cats. Got the cats and his parents got super toxic for years. Mind you, they never visited him before I moved in. 2 times a year what he told me. They never forgave me because \u201cI was the problem and that I forced him to do this\u201d. We were \u201cselfish and should return them back to the shelter\u201d.
