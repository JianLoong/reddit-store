In this market that's pretty amazing!", "NTA. You are not prioritizing your dog over your brother. You are prioritizing your OWN LIFE over taking over your parent's responsibilities.", "NTA.\n\nTheir assumptions are not your problem, especially as they failed to inform you of any of them.", "What?! Huge NTA. They don\u2019t get to dictate how you want to live and it\u2019s def not your responsibility to support your brother.", "NTA. If they NEVER told you about this then they have zero expectations. If they did say something to you then you still wouldn't be an AH, but would raise more questions for sure. \n\nYou are living your life and they need to respect that. Your brother has options and to tell YOU to get rid of your new furbaby is just unconscionable.", "NTA. \n\nPretty inconsiderate of them to make a plan based on your time, resources, and consent without actually gaining your consent. \n\nYour home, your family, your choice.", "NTA.

Nor are you obligated to house your brother.", "NTA, and they shouldn't bill you for anything. It's your house not your brother's.", "NTA\n\nI am break out in hives allergic to cats.  \n\nOne of my siblings has 3 of them.\n\nI have never once been angry at them about it.\n\nSuch is life", "NTA\n\nI hope your family comes to their senses and realize how stupid they sound lol. I would get another dog just because now.", "NTA\n\nI love how they are trying to control you.  Your home, your decision.  You decided to get a dog.    \nThey don\u2019t get to volunteer your home for your brother to live in\u2026. Does he even want to attend a school where you are?  Wouldn\u2019t he rather be with other students his own age?", "NTA your brother is in no way your responsibility! It sounds like your pup saved the day! You don\u2019t have to have an unwanted house guest your parents drop on you! Congrats on the new family member! We didn\u2019t get a pic tho", "NTA. They never told you that they planned on having your brother stay with you. Even if they did, it's your choice to let that happen or not. They're still making decisions for you when you're a grown adult. I wouldn't blame your brother for any of this unless he also was in on the plans without telling you, or maybe your parents told him you agreed and he doesn't know the extent of what your parents are doing.\n\nDon't get rid of the dog. If you want to support your brother there are other ways you can do so.", "NTA. How ridiculous. The only way you\u2019d be an ass is if you made an agreement regarding your brother and your parent\u2019s financial help. They are acting so entitled and lack self awareness. I hope you enjoy your new home with Bradley!", "NTA - It's the excuse that's as old as time... \"We helped with W, so you should return the favor with X, Y, and Z!\" Your parents really dropped the ball here and trying to cash in on their investment of helping you pay for college with little to no respect to you as a person. At least this happened before they emotionally and financially ambushed you out of nowhere but I would go no contact for a bit to let them stew in their perceived entitlement being denied.", "NTA. Now stop evading the dog tax", "Definitely NTA. And it is wrong for parents to hold tasing you over your head like that. \n\nWhat does your brother think of this whole situation", "NTA. Sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "NTA! Wow not only are they trying to dictate your life but they planned to offer your home to your brother without your permission. I\u2019d get a second dog.", "NTA. Also, lol at the \"bill me\". *Chef's kiss*", "NTA.", "NTA.  You've always wanted a dog and now you can have one.  Your parents never said anything to you about their plans, but those were *their* plans *not yours*. It's a shame about your brother's allergies.\n\nI grew up with a brother who was allergic to everything with hair. My mom always told me that I could have a whole farm when I grew up and every kind of animal I wanted. Welp, I gave birth to a child who has allergies just like my brother.  I ended up rehoming a wonderful 8 year old dog to my in-laws bc my son was sssooo allergic.  I still cry about that sometimes.\n\nI feel for you.", "Nta for getting a dog. \nBut yta for the way you're handling the argument.", "NTA  Enjoy your home and Bradley, the wonder dog.", "NTA unless you don\u2019t provide the dog tax.", "If you play the \"we paid for X and you owe us\" card, and you get Uno Reversed with \"then send me a bill,\" you have no right to complain about it. Also, Bradford is probably a better person than your whole family. He can stay and they can go. NTA.", "NTA.  I am allergic to cats.  Everyone in my family has at least 1 cat perhousehold.  I live 3,000 miles away from my hometown.  I get back to visit a couple times a year, but I would never expect or demand anyone in my family get rid of their cats to accommodate me.  Keep your dog, your brother can live in a dorm.", "NTA they are your brother's parents, not you and you're not responsible for housing your brother. I think your response to be billed was fine and it's insane that they've made plans for your brother in their heads and now are mad because you didn't know?? Keep the dog.", "NTA.  They sound super entitled and controlling to think that they get to tell you who will stay in your home, and what pets you can own.  You are an adult.  If they tell you to get rid of the dog again I would just cut contact.", "NTA...Dude, you handled that like a boss.  I've got nothing else to say except \"Can I borrow some of that wax you shine that spine with?\"", "NTA. You are 26. You own your own home, presumably have employment and pay your own bills. No one gets to dictate what goes on in your home. \n\nEnjoy Bradley and the many years of companionship to come!", "NTA", "NTA. Noone who knows the love of a dog would ever willingly give it up because someone else told them to. They have no right to your house and no right to tell you what to do. It's sad your brother is allergic and will never know the love of a dog, but that stopped being your problem when you moved out. Dogs are the best!", "you gotta let us see the dog", "NTA... trying to control you and your life from a distance is weird and wrong. Considering their stance, I dont think you are out of line.", "NTA, what in the entitled fuck? Keep posting pictures of more dogs you\u2019ve \u201cadopted\u201d.", "Interesting how brother is choosing a college where OP moved to", "NTA. Prioritize yourself not your Brother. Your Brother are your parents sole responsibility. Its your house. Your money. Your dog. Yours. And Yes to cutting ties to toxic family.", "NTA - how could you have known!? And no way are you getting rid of the dog, THAT would be irresponsible. They're just mad because their plans are ruined.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nKeep the dog. \n\nThe family was rather presumptuous that the brother could just stay with you while in school.\n\nOne of the perks to having cats. My stepmother is just that allergic.", "NTA. I feel like this is a sneaky way to ensure that you *never* got a dog because there will *always* be another reason for you not to get a dog. So hold your ground and enjoy life with Bradley!", "NTA\n\nFuck them. Do not give up your new friend.", "NTA your parents just leapt to conclusions without mentioning it to you and you have taken the responsibility for a living creature. you accepted your brother's allergies all your life and now grown with your own home, you are doing what you want in your home.\n\nthey are not just worried about a visit, they expect someone to live in your home for years\n\nas for helpnig you in school, guess they were going to help your brother by telling him to live with you.", "NTA dog tax! I love huskies but don\u2019t want the work.", "You're absolutely NTA, and I love the way you handled your parents.\n\nI'm curious though -- has your brother shown any interest in going to college in your city/state or moving in with you, or is this just more BS from your parents?  (I can definitely see him wanting to move out of their place!)", "NTA! Omg this is crazy!", "NTA you have no responsibility to your parents or brother. They should have been helping you because they are your parents and that\u2019s their job, not to have you be responsible for their other child.", "It is unfair for parents to hold you like this.", "\u201cWhat we haven\u2019t told you, and would be an unreasonable request even if we had.\u201d NTA!", "Bu-but OP is supposed to be a mind reader! Of course he should have known that! /s", "They sound too entitled and controlling to think they can tell you who lives in your house and what pets you can own.", "Yup. You\u2019re only TA if you don\u2019t pay your tax.", "Right, them helping her financially was their decision and it's fucked up to have strings attached"]}
