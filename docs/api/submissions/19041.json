You were so mature in understanding all those years that a dog just wasn\u2019t a possibility, and if anything they should be happy for you to finally get to have that in your life.

It\u2019s also completely ridiculous to 1) ask you to return the \u201cfavor\u201d of their parenting, and 2) expect you to somehow know that expectation without ever mentioning it to you, and call you irresponsible because of it.

You might consider that a win. \n\n I\u2019m in exactly the same position - my spouse is allergic to dogs and one of our adult kids got a dog - so we simply don\u2019t go there. It means we don\u2019t see the grandchildren as much and can never babysit in their house when they need a sitter or even have Christmas or birthday dinner there but it is their house and they have chosen. In fact it is a very good way of ensuring you don\u2019t see much of them if that's your intent.", "NTA, I waited over almost 20 years before I got my cat, I understand your brother allergies suck.

My ex-boyfriend always wanted animals but couldn\u2019t have one when he grew up. When he moved out he worked too much to be able to take good care of one by himself, but when we got together and I eventually moved in with him, we decided to get cats. Got the cats and his parents got super toxic for years. Mind you, they never visited him before I moved in. 2 times a year what he told me. They never forgave me because \u201cI was the problem and that I forced him to do this\u201d. We were \u201cselfish and should return them back to the shelter\u201d. Our relationship didn\u2019t work out in the end (6 years, and they were unfortunately a part of that) so I took the cats and left since we agreed on that if anything happens with us, I should have them since they followed me around everywhere.

Enjoy!", "NTA. not even close. remind your parents that you're an adult, who has his own home and you are allowed to do as you see fit in your home. guilt tripping you because they helped you, now in turn you must help your brother is a sure way for them to not hear from you. it's not your job to be a third parent for them.", "NTA.  No Mom and Dad tough crap!  Dog is staying.\nCongrats on your dog!", "NTA.   It would be nice to discuss their plans for you housing your brother for his college years in advance with you.  Enjoy your dog :)", "NTA. They should have let you know upfront that paying for college came with strings attached.

They were expecting to tell you probably right before school started and it\u2019d be too late to get him in to student housing. I\u2019m also betting that once he was in your home they\u2019d tell you at the last minute that you\u2019d be hosting holidays with them staying there and then having your brother stay in the summer since he\u2019s already there. Also then it\u2019s on you to have to boot him out someday instead of them. Nope.

Brother will pay much higher tuition for an out-of-state school. Staying with you eliminates most housing costs. Although, I'm not sure your parents intend to give you any money for him.  If he stays in-state the lower tuition will help cover his dorm costs. Keep your dog and let your brother choose an instate school. NOTE: I do not care if the college near you is your brother's \"dream school\". He can't afford it without you sacrificing dog ownership. So he and your parents need to come up with a new plan.", "NTA.\n\nAnd this whole college thing is really confusing.\n\nSo, they\u2019re sending him to an out of state college?

How did they know where you were going to purchase your house? Did they just decide wherever you lived is where he would go to college. I laughed out loud for real when you told them to invoice you. That was excellent. It is not your responsibility to help your brother through college, it is either his or theirs. You are not his mother. Stick to your guns. Give Bradley a big hug for me.

Also why does he need to stay with you rather than dorms/his own apartment?", "So them helping you out was only conditional under the assumption that you'd eventually help your brother out? Yet they never thought to voice these conditions and assumptions to you? Man, NTA, but your folks sure are.

You \u201cowe\u201d them for \u201chelping you?\u201d Lmfao. No one told them to bump uglies and have kids. That was a choice, providing for you and your brother was the consequence.

Your home, your kid.\" or simply stop replying to them at all.\n\nThese people are absolutely ridiculous!
