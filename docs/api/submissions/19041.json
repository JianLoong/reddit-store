NTA.", "NTA. Enjoy your life with your Bradley. Dog tax though.", "NTA. Your parents sound controlling and your brother isn't your responsibility. He is theirs.

In this market that's pretty amazing!", "NTA. You are not prioritizing your dog over your brother. You are prioritizing your OWN LIFE over taking over your parent's responsibilities.", "NTA.\n\nTheir assumptions are not your problem, especially as they failed to inform you of any of them.", "What?! Huge NTA. They don\u2019t get to dictate how you want to live and it\u2019s def not your responsibility to support your brother.", "NTA. If they NEVER told you about this then they have zero expectations. If they did say something to you then you still wouldn't be an AH, but would raise more questions for sure. \n\nYou are living your life and they need to respect that. Your brother has options and to tell YOU to get rid of your new furbaby is just unconscionable.", "NTA. \n\nPretty inconsiderate of them to make a plan based on your time, resources, and consent without actually gaining your consent. \n\nYour home, your family, your choice.", "NTA. While I feel bad that your brother's allergies are so bad, your parents have no right to dictate how you live in your own home. Enjoy having your own home where you can do whatever you wish, including having one or more fur babies.", "NTA this is the reason we move out - to do/get/buy the things we couldn't under our parents' roof. You finally got the opportunity to have a dog and took it. Good for you! (Dog tax, please.)\n\nTell your parents that they can support your brother's post-secondary the way they supported yours. That's their responsibility, not yours. Thank them for whatever they did and move on.\n\nYour home is not theirs to dictate what goes, who stays, and when. Pbth to them.", "NTA", "NTA. They just wanted to pawn your brother off on you. That's all this is.", "So they expected you to take care of your younger brother throughout college??? In this economy??? NTA", "Nta they can't hold being a responsible parent over your head and I understand your sentiment there, idk if your parents realize how unreasonable they're being", "NTA. The only reason I'd even consider saying you're the AH is because I see no pictures of said puppy.\n\nFuck your parents, enjoy Bradley.", "NTA it's your home.", "NTA.  As for Bradley?  He's....a good boy! Yes, he is.\n\n... I love huskys.  Lol", "NTA why do they feel like it's your own job to take care of your brother?
