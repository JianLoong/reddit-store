It's just this one occasion, and it's not like you'll *have* to spend time with him. Not telling you to invite him either, but if he comes along, so what?", "NTA\n\nYou could however use the opportunity, of being invited and attending, to rub his nose in the fact that he was completely wrong. This is a celebration of you graduating, your day.\n\nYou never mentioned if he went back to college....if not, then it will also highlight his failure and him being the college dropout.", "NTA, you can invite whoever you want. It doesn\u2019t sound like mom is a great support either considering the identity theft; but if you\u2019ve put that behind you\u2026 Congratulations on your graduation!", "NTA. Your brother was saying you were going to fail. Why let him be there when you succeed?", "Nta", "While I\u2019ll give an NTA based purely on what you\u2019ve written here, he hasn\u2019t done anything unforgivable and I think EWSH if you didn\u2019t invite him without at least trying to clear the air.  If you and your brother were as close as you say, it would be worth trying to extend an olive branch.

His snide remark about you dropping out was undoubtedly unnecessary, but you do have to keep in mind that when he expressed needing to take a break from classes, regardless of whatever personal reasons he may have had for doing so, you chose to be critical of his choice instead of showing support when he needed it, so it's possible that he was really hurt by that and elected to not be supportive of you in kind.  \n\n\nRather than allowing him to come so that he can witness proof of your success and potentially eat crow, you're wanting to create an incredibly uncomfortable situation for your entire family based off of one off-hand comment he made years ago that, from the sounds of things, doesn't even reflect how he feels about you having attended college anymore.  \n\n\nUltimately, it's your decision, but do understand there will almost certainly be ramifications if you don't let him go and that the sole person responsible/at fault will be ***you***, not him.", "NTA Do what you gotta do but this may kill any chance of rekindling a sibling relationship as your mother said.", "ESH. \n\n-your brother wanted to drop out. Financially this is a huge toll. He didn\u2019t need a lesson (I\u2019m assuming he had plenty from your mom). He told you because you guys were closed and that\u2019s what felt right to him \n\n-he told you he\u2019d be there when you\u2019d drop out. Was it him not believing in you? Or was it him being petty by turning around the situation that had happened to him and telling you that as opposed to how you behaved, if you were to drop out, he\u2019d actually support you ? Are you reading too much into it ?\n\n-how did you and your mother resolve the credit card issue ? Your brother\u2019s reaction would really depends on it. Clearly his words are terrible. But if you resolved this issue by realising it\u2019s not what had happened, your brother would have been right saying you\u2019re a liar as he would have thought you\u2019d lied (but actually it was just a misunderstanding). \n\nHonestly the precursor of all that was you not supporting him (who likes a nagging brat ?) and then you maybe reading too much into his comment about dropping it. You took it as him telling you youd fail, he might have done it to let you know that even you were not supportive when he had yo drop out, he\u2019ll be the bigger person and support you. \n\nHis actual insults regarding the credit card were bad, but the rest of the situation depends on how you fixed the issue with your mom. Why are you not upset with her for messing up your credit ?\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to invite him, go for it. But at the end of the day that\u2019s the thread ruptured. If you\u2019re ready to end this relationship with your brother then go for it I guess ?", "NTA. Your brother wants you to fail because everytime you succeed it reinforces how poorly he's doing in his own life, everytime you tell someone about an achievement or good thing that's happened to you, he'll view it as a subtle attack on him.

Invite him specifically to the ceremony. Tell him youd love for him to be there when you graduate and make sure your mother hears it. Rub.it.in. Sister", "NTA he didn't support you and then for your mother to do that and him to call you out your name is a no. He can go celebrate his own success and college degree. Enjoy your day because it's all about you and you can want positive energy around. Keep checking your credit though cause what your mom did absolutely inexcusable.", "NTA and it's your graduation so you can include anyone you want. It sounds like your brother has been nasty and unsupportive anyway. But if you miss the relationship you had with your brother and want to see if it can be repaired, you could extend the invitation as an olive branch. Up to you.", "What have I missed? I've read your mother committed credit fraud against you putting debt in your name and probably ruining your credit score but is still on the talking/graduation invite list but your brother made a flippant comment mirroring how you made him feel but he's probably not going to get invited? \n\nMaybe you two just need to talk it out, you went up against your mum for what she did, talk to your brother and smooth it out before you lose each other for good, you said you were close before, why risk losing the potential to be that again over mis-communication and hurt feelings? \n\nIf he's not interested at least you tried and know where you stand before making it worse when there was a chance to heal it.", "I think in general it is something most people would not say though. Most people are like congratulations! I'll be there every step of the way. I have never heard someone ever be like \"I'll be here to support you when you drop out.\" The brother had to have realize how poorly it sounded. Maybe other words were exchanged to explain what he meant further but at the moment it does come off that the brother holds some bitterness toward OP.", "You were able to forgive your mother for identity theft, but not your brother?\n\nI mean, if that's how you feel, cool, NTA. But honestly, I'd either invite both or neither.", "I\u2019d invite him. Let him decide if he wants to come or not. All the issues written about here about him are small, trivial (in my opinion), and in the past. Let them go; stop dwelling on them. \n\nThe celebration of a \u201cgraduation\u201d is about moving forward. \u201cGradus\u201d is the Latin root word of it; it means \u201cto go\u201d or \u201cstep.\u201d You are an educated lady now, not an emotional teen; please behave as maturely as possible. Congratulations on your graduation!", "NTA\n\n\"she said that it was ultimately my choice but that it would probably end our relationship altogether\" To me it looks like your brother already did that by himself.\n\nSurround yourself with people that wants the best for you, not people that are expecting you to fail.", "You\u2019re doing him a favor. Who even cares? Graduations are oh so boring.", "It\u2019s time to do the mature thing and invite your brother to your graduation. If he is also mature, then the two of you may salvage a relationship that went off the rails when you were both teenagers (a.k.a children).", "I mean, I think his response to you was because you were Very unsuportive of him when talk to you about droping out. You focused on money over why he needed a break, that wasn't cool.\nAbout him calling you names, that IS another story and Very wrong. You probably need to talk.", "NTA But if you invite him, he will get mad because you will be \"rubbing his nose in it.\"", "ESH, you a bit more.\n\nYou realize you started this, right? He wanted to do a gap year (or months), you pulled alleged stats out of your butt and shat them on him. I don't know where you are, but every study I've ever seen shows gap year students return, and in the long-run, a small percentage of them typically outperform other students.\n\nSo, after you told him he'd fail if he took a gap year, he took the petty opportunity to clap back when you got your spot. He gave you as much support as you gave him.\n\nThe stuff with your Mom and the credit card is irrelevant.\n\nInvite whom you want to your graduation, and accept the fallout from your decision.", "Nah, he\u2019ll probably try to downplay your accomplishment somehow. I mean, you can invite him but do expect some negative comments. Have your answer ready.", "A lot of universities and colleges convocation auditoriums have limited seating capacity, and audience is by tickets only. My undergrad, I was trading various favours to get extra tickets. For graduate stuff, I was in a different country, so I traded my tickets for ummmm, extra drinks at the pub celebration afterwards....  \n\n\nSo if the OP only gets 2 or 4 tickets or whatever, they might really prefer those seats go to those who supported and were really there for them through the ordeal that is post-secondary education.", "I think I did a poor job of explaining the credit card thing. It wasn't identity theft. I was put on my mother's credit card as an authorized user as a kid. My mother's intentions were to help me build my credit but it didn't work out since she stopped paying. We were able to work it out with the bank to take my name off the card and erase any negative effect it had in my credit which is why I forgive her. The reason I haven't forgive my brother is becuase I feel like he said those things to be malicious or vindictive. After reading these comments I think the best thing for me to do is talk to him and ask him if he believes the things he said or not. Maybe we can move past it, maybe we can't. I'll see him on Christmas, I guess that's when I'll ask.", "Ew"]}
