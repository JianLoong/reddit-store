He\u2019s proven he\u2019s okay with someone cheating and will cover for them", "Do you know for sure that roommate doesn't have an open relationship agreement with his girlfriend? Maybe they both see other people and know about it?", "Yeah the fact that he's so insistent on covering for his flatmate is sus af. It may be because the flatmate has also covered for him and he has cheated on you.  Or he just doesn't have a good moral system. Either way no bueno.", "Have an upvote for 'bedroom buddies' \ud83d\ude01", "Please tell the girl her BF is bringing women home at 11:30 at night. By no means are you the AH for telling the truth about this situation to the person being harmed. People who say \"mind your own business\" like weak-bumbledick only feel that way as long as its not THEM being wronged. I can 99% Guarantee every person would want you to tell them.", "Honestly dude bro code isn\u2019t defending cheaters or covering up for them. Bro code is more like not trying to have sex with the person your bro is interested in. I\u2019m sad that the bro code has been corrupted all these years. We need an Order 66.", "OP, get an STD/STI test for yourself to just to be safe because your boyfriends dismissal of your feelings and his willingness to go along with his bedroom buddies \"extra curricular activities\" is a little worrisome that he might have is own \"extra curriculars\". Please protect yourself first.", "Tbh I also think you should find the gfs details on social media and tell her. If they can havr a bro code to havr rach others backs, you can have a sister code and have hers too.", "I don't think it's bro code TBH. If they're sharing a room your boyfriend might not be able to like, afford to move out to a better living situation. He's just not wading into a situation that could blow up. It doesn't necessarily say anything about how he feels about you.\n\nAnd: nothing happened. You said this girl left because she was uncomfortable. So for all you know, his actual GF hasn't been exposed to any STIs or anything. Also, like, have you ever told a GF she's being cheated on? Or that her boyfriend tried it with you? I'm a white lady, a guy hit on me pretty aggressively and said something pretty racist about his Asian girlfriend in the process. So I contacted her - she flipped out at me. It did not help the situation, it just made her defensive. You may have good intentions, but girlfriends aren't necessarily inclined to believe other women who come forward with this kind of information. In fact, in their minds it can be \"evidence\" that you \"want their man\" because you're a \"jealous hater\" etc. You're trying to do a good thing but it could blow up in your face.\n\nI'm not sure it's your place to wade into this relationship. Even if this guy is acting shady in some ways. If your boyfriend is stuck in a lease with this person and can't afford to bail, he may just be keeping his head down because he needs to more or less keep the peace.\n\nSeriously: my advice is don't read anything into this and stay out of it. Your BF is stuck living there for now. You should just keep your heads down until he can move out.", "I wouldnt want my partner to tell his GF either cause I have to share a room with this guy.  After his GF finds out and OP is home who do you think all his frustration will come out on?", "> Maybe im naive...\n\nThat'd be my bet, yes.  It's the only way the whole story makes sense.  I mean, if there was no intent of cheating, nobody should have objected to telling the girlfriend.", "NTA, but it isn\u2019t actually any of your business and you should really consider the consequences. The right thing to do is tell her. Your boyfriend just showed you that he\u2019s not so disgusted by cheating that he isn\u2019t willing to just look the other way with his friend. What does that mean for your relationship?", ">she has told me that their relationship is monogamous and exclusive\n\nWeird since you hardly have any contact with her. I've never shared that sort of relationship info with any other women I barely know. Nonetheless, NTA, although I wonder about your current bf getting mad at you for wanting to snitch on a would-be cheater.", "That's what gets me. I don't agree with cheating on SO, but bf is obviously in a less than stellar situation, making his roommate angry at him isn't gonna help. Especially cause she's her bfs guest.\n\nShe can do what she wants but it won't make anyones life easier.", "It is more the fact how he told her to mind her own business. He should have said that she was right and roommate was a cheating asshole. But that he has to live there so he can't say anything if he wants to keep it civil.", "People are getting downvoted because of gender dynamics. Reverse the genders and it\u2019s \u201cgirl you\u2019re an adult you don\u2019t need to tell anyone anything\u201d \u201cyou go girl \ud83d\udc85\u201d And who knows what else.\n\nAnd yet no one cares about the BF who other an expressing a slightly unpopular opinion, may have to deal with the fallout of potentially losing his bed because of it.", "Just tacking on an extra two cents, but I don't understand why he couldn't tell you during your private conversation something like \"Yeah I don't like it but I live with this dude not his gf so I'm just dealing with it\". Why did he need to curse at you or get angry?", "This is an interesting point. If this is the reasons he should let her know that.", "This is not great advice because the girlfriend could blow up at her and add another level of awkward to the situation.\n\nThe BF is what sounds like stuck in a weird living situation because he probably can't afford anything better. He's within his rights to not rock the boat, esp since the attempted cheater can't seem to seal the deal with any of these attempted one-night stands.\n\nIf GF is being exposed to STDs, that's one thing. If women come back to this apartment and see that these guys are sharing a literal room like in StepBrothers and bail? I mean, leave it. 100% Just leave it and don't try and make OP's boyfriend fuck up his living situation. \n\nHe is sharing a ROOM with this guy - that means very little privacy. If the guy gets angry he could steal or destroy his belongings, shred his passport/important documents, I dunno do all kinds of weird aggressive damage, just to be an asshole. BF is right to want to keep his head down.", "That is bad advice because you're only thinking about the girlfriend and not about how this would affect the boyfriends living situation. Remember they share a room so if things go bad it can really be detrimental to the boyfriend or even get him kicked out or his stuff stole them broken. You don't know what the situation could turn into. \n\nThe roommate could be a crazy person. The girlfriend could be a crazy person. I've seen both. I've seen it when they're both crazy and by even insinuating there's cheating going on. It causes so many issues so if she's ready to let her boyfriend live with her in case things go bad with the roommate, go ahead and say something, but if she's not willing to put her place as a safe place for the boyfriend then she should stay out of it", "Well, \"bros over h--s\" may have different interpretations, but enabling cheating and false bro-solidarity may be one of most common.", "Right but wouldn\u2019t it be appropriate the for the boyfriend to explain this to OP rather than just shouting at her \u2018it\u2019s none of her business\u2019???", "I will admit I never thought about it this way", "This! In a real world scenario man has to keep his tenancy.", "This!   Then it would be, a the friend of roommate is coming over.  Sure tell gf, she knows her to! \n\nNot all that hush sh*t. \n\nAlso the fact the other girl was uncomfortable with the dude having a roommate. (And that late in the evening?)", "Yeah makes sense, thank you. Dont get the downvotes for asking a question but hey\ud83d\ude02", "Yeah that's what I'm thinking. Boyfriend and roommate both seem... not great. \n\nNTA OP, but do know that things may not go well if you tell her", "What? We only know the OP knows the gf through OP\u2019s bf and his roommate. We don\u2019t know how much time they\u2019ve spent together either at the apartment or otherwise. They could very well all hang out by means of their respective boyfriends and still not have exchanged numbers.", "Exactly", "Boyfriend made his bed, he and his friend can both lay in it.", "He chose his path. It\u2019s time to walk it.", "Exactly. That's where I found the red flag too...if he's wanting to keep things peaceful with the roommate, why would he be so quick to be aggressive to his girlfriend?", "That's so f obvious I can't beleive one has to explain this.", "You never thought about it loool maybe plug your brain\n\nRedditors ofc don't give a shit about ruining your bf relation with his roomate and having to find another place to live, they just want cheaters to be punished", "Of course, self absorbed people never do.", "I haven\u2019t acted on anything, so there\u2019s no reason to call me self absorbed", "It must be so blissful living in a world without nuance."]}
