We talked before dinner, it went well. The guy is polite but quite cold and more of an analyser.\n\nJust before we divulge in our food, I advise us to put our hands together as normal with my daughter and wife. Her boyfriend did so and was keen on joining us in prayer. Though, my daughter has been quite sacrilegious lately. Instead of holding mine and her mother\u2019s hand, she just held his and started praying aloud. She says \u201cFather his boyfriend\u2019s name\u201d and proceeds to say foolish things like \u201cmay god (the guy next to me) help me find my way in this cruel world\u201d. I was shocked as this is abhorrent, as a devout person to see my daughter technically pray to a man? It was the most profane thing one can do. My wife just laughed and thought it was funny. I proceeded to ask her \u201chow she could say that?\u201d and she said \u201cwell, I prayed to the God of my faith\u201d meaning her boyfriend. Her boyfriend just let go of her hand and whispered something in her ear. She proceeds to apologize and said that \u201cshe was just speaking honestly\u201d.\n\nWe finished dinner on an awkward note and when my daughter was helping me in the kitchen I told her that \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see her again if she were to pull stunts like that\u201d. She got upset and just said she was heading out anyways. Proceeded to drive back to wherever she came from and my wife has been upset with me after I informed her of what I said.

My very devout aunt (my mom\u2019s sister) was visiting us and it was time to say grace (which we did as a family anyway) but I chose that meal to say a \u201cfunny\u201d grace. And believe it or not, my aunt thought it was funny, but it was my mother (who was not as religiously conservative as my aunt) who was livid. \n\nBut my aunt knew that most of the time, I was a good, kind, respectful kid. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where your response here is what makes you the AH. I\u2019m not denying that what your daughter said was unkind and disrespectful- but are you really willing to sacrifice a lifelong relationship over this one moment? Walking her down the aisle, getting to know future grandchildren, being able to see her best moments as well as being supportive in her worst? \n\nIf you are willing to sever ties over something so small, I\u2019d say that you have a problem with being unloving and unable to accept religious differences, not your daughter.\n\nListen to your wife.", "The dude is gross for living with a barely legal teen while he\u2019s pushing 30, but your faith should not be used as a weapon to judge and isolate her.

This could create an uneven power dynamic where your daughter is relying on this man for everything, and she is unable to be independent. On the other hand, he might be a wonderful man and this may be a great relationship. However, if things do go south, she will need someone else who can support her in her time of need. If you walk away now, she might not consider you a safe person to go to, and she might be more likely to be stuck in this bad situation. When it comes to the religion itself, I'm not sure what you practice, but most religions have an emphasis on forgiveness and understanding.

With a father like this, it's no surprise that she would go quite far in rebelling. \n\nYou're lucky she didn't give a \"hail Baphomet\" and ask that we each find reason and science, followed by a loud \"thanks be to Satan\" because that's the kind of thing I'd do if you were my father.\n\nIf your religious tradition is more important than your daughter, who is clearly testing boundaries, then you are most certainly TA.", "ESH you can\u2019t stuff church down someone\u2019s throat, then at 19 with possibly her first real boyfriend, expect her to go back to that faith without finding her own way. \n\nIt\u2019s funny church people always teach tolerance towards others but never really practice it.", "While I don't agree with your daughter's behaviour, as someone whose mother has cut off contact because of religious bullshit, YTA.\n\nYou are essentially telling her that your love for her is conditional.

Just because she's your daughter doesn't mean she has to have the same belief system as you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I was shocked as this is abhorrent, as a devout person to see my daughter technically pray to a man? It was the most profane thing one can do.\n\nThere are far worse things happening in most churches these days than what your daughter did, and saying it's the most profane thing one can do is an exaggeration. \n\nI hope you can see that your reaction could have been better.", "YTA", "YTA. I agree with you that your daughter shouldn\u2019t have \u201cprayed\u201d like that at your dinner table, but she\u2019s 19, on the cusp of adulthood and starting to find her own path in the world. She is trying to figure out how to act like an adult and how she wants others to see her. The fact that her boyfriend said something discreetly to her and she apologized means he is a good influence on her and she is willing to learn/respect other people\u2019s boundaries.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but she\u2019s going to be making a lot of her own decisions from now on and they might not be the same decisions you would make.  You don\u2019t have to like it, but you don\u2019t get to dictate her relationships, religion, or behavior anymore. You can have expectations for when she is at your home, but you have made the transition from \u201cparent who is raising a child\u201d to \u201cparent that has raised a child\u201d.  You are a secondary character in her story now. It\u2019s bittersweet and heart wrenching, but it\u2019s life. Let her fly.

You think she worships her boyfriend\u2014 no wonder! when the father who is supposed to love her cuts her off for her first mistake! She even apologized and you can\u2019t explain why what she did was offensive until after you\u2019ve decided she fails your test?\n\nYou are supposed to teach your kid. You failed.

You being so pushy about it has probably more than a little to do with your daughter choosing a different path.\n\nDisowning your child is a super \u201creligious\u201d thing to do.

YTA.", "Yta - 1 - cause you're talking about her like some unimportant less than human being thing just because she doesn't hold your beliefs and cause she doesn't want to do what you want. Yta for insinuating that she is acting like shallow gold digger . Yta for overreacting like that. Lastly , there is so much context missing but i have a feeling she never held your beliefs and not even your wife approves of the extreme religiousness you hold. I have this weird feeling that your daughter grew up being forced to be religious and resents your household, it gives me fuck off from strict home as soon as she turned of legal age vibes. Congrats on never seeing your grandkids and dying alone. Unless you repent", "she is not lost.  she has expanded her thinking and is moving in a different direction, which is contraindicated in your very devout life.  you have a very narrow view of what is acceptable and she has moved away from there.  try and let her grow into her own person without so much judgment.  what she did was childish and disrespectful.  her boyfriend was gracious.  please find a middle ground so you can get through this awkward time and learn to respect each other.  esh.", "YTA: Your religion is more important to you than your daughter. Wow.", "YTA. Assuming you\u2019re American, the very first right in the first amendment of the constitution is freedom of religion. Whether you agree or disagree, it is her right. Should she have said some gobbledygook during what she knows to be your prayer time, no.  But how tolerant are you to say you never want to see her again. Is that truly a Christian thing to say?", "YTA\n\nNever let politics or religion divide your family.  Neither is worth it.  Family matters above just about everything.\n\nPlus, she\u2019s 19 and doing what teenagers do.  Tell her you are disappointed in her behavior and that her actions hurt you.  If your family loves each other, they will come around.\n\nCutting her off over a silly prayer is a great way for you to lose more then your daughter.", "It sounds like your actual issue may be that your daughter is dating someone much older than her. It sounds like maybe her problem with you is actually that you're judging her over her lifestyle choice so she's choosing to poke fun at yours. Maybe you need to be the bigger person here and accept your daughter and apologize. It sounds like religion was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAnd I was 19 when I started dating my husband, who was 27 at the time. We've been together almost a decade and have three kids. Sometimes love just makes sense, and it doesn't have to make sense to everyone else. If your daughter is happy then why the fuss about their ages? It would be better to get to know him so you can find out if it's just a good fit or if there are actual red flags you should be concerned about.\n\nYTA", "Exactly this. OP is way over reacting but even if his daughter doesn\u2019t share the same beliefs she could have been more mature about it", "Yep\n\nESH\n\nAnd OP, you\u2019re highly judgmental. Imposing any way of life on another is not pious, let your daughter be and she won\u2019t rebel. It\u2019s ok her boyfriend is stoic. She\u2019s not lost for enjoying the honeymoon phase, and if she is it\u2019s just life at 19, she will find her way (just don\u2019t discourage her will).", "No, he\u2019s NTA. He already said she\u2019s been sacrilegious lately but whatever, and he still made an effort to be good family and had his daughter and her MUCH older boyfriend (let\u2019s be real, at those ages the gap might as well be doubled for how far apart they are in maturity) to a pleasant dinner. She came in and deliberately belittled his faith and did something she knew he\u2019d find terribly offensive. How hard is it to just hold hands and stay silent while everyone else prays?", "To me it sounded more like he didn\u2019t want to see her again IF she were to continue praying like she did in his house, not that he never wanted to see her again at all. He just wants her to respect his home, which she should. \n\nShe can believe and pray to whoever she wants but she\u2019s fully aware of what her parents believe and when she is in their house she needs to respect that. She was making a mockery of their beliefs.", "Agreed. She was being edgy and pushing boundaries in a very rude way, but OPs response wasn't equal.

Despite not approving of her choices, he\u2019s still trying to be a loving dad and had her and her boyfriend over. He wanted everyone to say Grace for dinner; that\u2019s no more imposing religion on someone than a Muslim asking you to take your shoes off before coming inside. How hard is it to be respectful, hold hands and just be silent? She attacked him for wanting them to just say Grace. He said they talked before dinner and it went well, so presumably he wasn\u2019t preaching all night.
