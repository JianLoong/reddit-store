Keep in mind, you have to work with this guy, so what happens on these double dates will likely be whispered about at work.\n\nYour girlfriend appears to have an addictive personality, since she tends to both overeat and get drunk. Unfortunately, that is not something you can address until she's ready.", "NTA. She did embarass you. If she regularly drinks like this, it could easily be linked to her putting on weight.

Relationship status? - You don't have to answer any of these, of course. They are just to illustrate that it is not as simple as saying that she has become embarassing.", "NTA. I'm sorry your girlfriend has weight problems and is insecure about them - it doesn't sound like she is happy right now. But that was not the appropriate venue for her to rant about her frustrations. It was a work related event, and you needed to be professional. She wasn't. Even if she didn't make not-really-jokes about her weight gain, she is TA for getting drunk at a work related event. That is always a bad idea.", "NTA\n\nThis was a work related dinner, not a dinner party with friends. A", "NTA. \n\nI think it's commendable that you apologized to them.

Her behavior\u2014both the getting drunk on your company's money and then monopolizing the conversation and joking about herself all night\u2014sounds like she thought she was out with old friends. I can see why this is embarrassing to you on a professional level, because the new worker didn't get a great first impression of the team he just joined.", "NTA.  GF behaved inappropriately at what was really a business dinner.  In these kinds of professional settings, especially with coworkers you don't know well, you tone down your true self a few notches and you make sure you don't drink too much.\n\nHaving said all that, this meal would have been WAY more appropriate as a work lunch ostensibly on company time and paid for by said company.  Manager made a really suspect decision here as well, but of course isn't responsible for GF's behavior.", "NTA. But for the future reference - work-related dinner should be between colleagues. Turning it a into double date was the first mistake.", "NTA but she needs therapy. This is her inner monologue coming out.

My doctor hasn\u2019t said anything about it but everyone else in my life has. I\u2019m not grossly unhealthy, but meds I take make me retain weight.

Equally as important.", "Even aside from the weight thing, getting that tanked at what\u2019s basically a work dinner - when she\u2019s meeting these people for the first time - is a red flag.

They aren't your friend. They are coworkers.", "Her monopolising the conversation is the problem, for me. Doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s talking about her weight, or the weather, or gardenscaping.

That is what\u2019s most embarrassing, to me.", "She doesn\u2019t get to decide what makes you uncomfortable. \n\nFor the record, your weight isn\u2019t a problem but your attitude and behavior are the problem and at this point there is no future for us.", "NTA.

It's ok to be what society defines as \"over\" weight as long as you're healthy and know your limits but getting drunk on casual nights out with a couple she doesn't know and joking about how she used to be what society defines as in \"acceptable\" weight but now she is not, are all signs for help. I truly believe that she just doesn't want to accept the fact that she is in danger now cause of her weight, loosing weight especially in late 20s and 30s is not easy and the beauty standrads when she was in her teens (based on her age now) was all about being skinny and slim and lean.   \nExplain to your co-worker that she had a night \"off\", everyone deserves to be vulnerable and in my eyes she embarrased herself, not you.
