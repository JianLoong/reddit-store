Sometimes males are only comfortable with male doctors when it comes to examining private parts. Same goes for females.

Why would sports involve seeing a kid naked?", "I have an eight and a nine year old - one of each gender.  They do still need access to the whole body, though for the most part, the doctor will just ask if they can either pull up their shirt or pull down their underwear.  My doctor is very clear with both my kids about who should/shouldn't be asking them to do that, and always gets consent.", "I had a wonderful male pediatrician and don\u2019t remember ever being uncomfortable.

The doctor pulls down her pants for two seconds just to take a quick look at her crotch (while reminding her that no one else should ever ask to see her crotch but her parents or a doctor) and I guess lifts up her shirt for a sec to check her abdomen, that's it.", "I remember having to take my shirt off for scoliosis testing but that was the extent at regular physicals. But for continuity of care, my pediatrician was also the one we went to when I had other illnesses, too, and there were a couple of times when I had to undress more fully.\n\nFWIW I had a male pediatrician until I was maybe 12 and we moved, and was comfortable with him, but I don't think I would have been comfortable if it had been my friend's dad, to draw the parallel to this story.", "The comparison is probably being made because boys do need to get naked and have their balls fondled at a physical.", "No but that isn\u2019t the point. The point is that boys do and it\u2019s uncomfortable with two women", "Yeah. I think this is very place dependent. The US is not very evidence-based compared to a lot of other countries. \n\nRoutine genital exams in children (beyond infancy) are not evidence-based. Periodic health exams beyond infancy/toddlerhood are actually not evidence-based either. \n\nIn other places, primary care practitioners will only examine children\u2019s bathing suit areas if there is a specific reason to do so. It is not routine. \n\nNTA. Going to the mother of a friend is not good practice.

Bravo!", "The problem is OPs son does not want to go to the other doctor, presumably you had no problem going to your doctor. \n\nThe issue is not having a doctor of the opposite sex. It's bodily autonomy.

That's the cash price.", "Good reading comprehension as that is not at all what I said, but you just continue your life of ignorance. Have fun!", "Funny.   I didn't say she makes all the appointments,  I pointed out that she was making this one, and that's clearly stated in the post.   You said that OP usually makes all the appointments,  but I don't see that anywhere.

I switched when I was 16 because he retired, but I still remember his low, soothing voice and his calm, patient demeanor.  He was 30-50 minutes away depending on traffic, but he was recommended to my parents when I was a baby, and they wanted someone they (and I) could trust, even if if meant a bit of a drive. \n\nHowever, if I switched from a female to a male pediatrician (who happened to be a parent of my friend) at age 9, PLUS my \"non-preferred\" parent was now in the room for an in depth exam of my body, I'd be really uncomfortable. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I did too, but after puberty started the nurse practitioner did the naked parts of the exam, and he was not in the room. If something has come up during those exams, I would have been sent to a gynecologist, and not gotten treatment from my pediatrician. My mom was always in the room for all exams. My dad almost never took me to the doctor, but that was because his job was far less flexible than mom's. If my dad had ever been the one to sit with me through a physical, after it was established that this wasn't the norm, I would have been uncomfortable, even at 9. Likely more due to the change itself than anything else.\n\nAnd it could be that OP's kid just doesn't want this change, and isn't worried about a woman doctor or being naked in front of his mom. And that's still valid, and a good reason to keep seeing his existing doctor who he likes and trusts.

I never even had that happen when I was growing up. The only time my pants came down was when I got my vaccinations in my butt and I was NOT HAPPY lol", "That sounds creepy. Standing up?

My doctor stopped diaper checks a while ago, and my daughter is only 3", "why exactly does the doc need to see her crotch though?\n\nwe don't get physical exams like that in the UK unless there's a problem that needs looking at.\n\nIt's pretty invasive to have that done once a year and i don't understand why it's done routinely in the US.    I'd have hated that as a child.", "That makes sense. My husband and I just went on a huge comparison of what our doctor visits were like growing up and he was talking about exactly that.", "At age 9?", "Thank you, yeah, I think I got my back up about the implications. Most of the time the gender of a doctor doesn't matter. Whatever the son is comfortable with and communicates to his parents is the right thing. I just hope this isn't a situation where the son is telling both parents what they want to hear.\n\nNot a lot of people are understanding about the SAHD thing.

My 8 year old and 11 year old have gone to the same pediatrician their whole life. If I just randomly started taking them to another, they would definitely voice their opinions and should be heard.

I always thought it was more of a check of pubic hair growth myself but I also never cared to ask as a child", "Also from the UK, I'm finding this all rather bizarre. Other than standard vaccinations (most of which after toddlerhood were done at school anyway) I only went to the doctor when sick.", "There is a bigger push now for pediatricians to recognize and report signs of abuse. They are looking for proper development but also any signs of redness, swelling, bruising, or cuts/scratches.  The abuser may be the one who brought the child in, or the abuser has made threats about telling anyone about the abuse, so asking outright is not a reliable way of screening.", "At every age.", "I am so fiercely protective of SAHD!!!

Of course it does, absolutely. \n\nMisogyny is the hatred of women but it is is also a culturally ingrained concept that expresses itself differently than literally hating a woman to her face.\n\nFor example, telling boys they can't wear pink is an example of misogyny because pink represents something feminine. And it is bad for boys to appear feminine. Why would that be bad if we didn't hate women or femininity? \n\n\"You play ball like a girl\" is another great example, name that movie! It's not literally like, punching a woman in the face, it's subtle microaggressions that guide our patterns of thinking and put us in binary boxes.\n\nMisandry is not culturally ingrained, it doesn't exist in any institutionalized level. It's hating men to hate men. It's not because the misandrists see masculinity or male gender stereotypes as a threat to their personal identity. They hate men because they hate men, but it doesn't guide our entire country's  idea of gender.", "Could you give an example of misandry then because you just further added an example of misogyny. \n\nI still have trouble understanding how a woman\u2019s dismissal of a 9 year old boy\u2019s comfort in a medical environment (in front of a female doctor) while having power over that child is somehow enforcing archaic gender roles or perpetuating any type of ingrained system (like your example of pink being a girl\u2019s color). \n\nIf we were to use something similar to your example the mother is dismissing the boys comfort and agency \u2026 because that is associated with girls/women and therefor eit is perpetuating some patriarchal system of consent and comfort?  \n\nI understand the general idea and how it can be applied to a lot of incidents, but for this specific instance just don\u2019t see how that applies here. Seems the mother and doctor would have the power and the mother is attempting to negate something that is strongly thought of as a beneficial thing for girls/women in the medical environment (comfort in the process).  So I guess that is my sticking point here. If this specific incident is misogyny then can there really ever be misandry?"]}
