My ex was even going to send over our son's records to her office.\n\nI told her that she had no idea what she was doing.

Sometimes males are only comfortable with male doctors when it comes to examining private parts. Same goes for females. For example, as a female I\u2019m not comfortable with a male doctor giving me a Pap smear. It\u2019s not that I think males can\u2019t be professional, I\u2019m just not comfortable baring my female parts to another man that isn\u2019t my partner even though I know it\u2019s part of a medical exam and not sexual. I know not all woman feel that way.

That's what you were used to.\n\n*This* child has always had a *male* doctor. This is not an idea time to change that.", "My son has zero problems with me being in the exam room.", "While creepy might not be the right word exactly, 9 years old is definitely of an age where puberty is hitting, they might be starting to get self conscious, and if there's a doctor and doctor visit routine they're already comfortable with it's not a good idea to suddenly switch it up without a *very good* reason. Frankly, at 9 I do think it should be fine for the parent (no matter the gender) to step out of the room for a couple minutes for aspects the kid might feel uncomfortable with others seeing. \n\nI'm glad your experience was so great, but we're talking about something entirely different. He *has* a doctor he's been very comfortable with for years. Would you have been as comfortable with your childhood doctor if you had a different one you trusted until right around onset of puberty and then suddenly got switched over to him?", "My pediatrician as a child was the father of a boy I went to school with. It wasn't like going and getting checked over in the living room, it was a doctor's office. Evan as a kid I didn't have a problem with it because at the end of the day he's a doctor and I'm a patient just like anyone else", "\u201cMy childhood doctor wasn\u2019t creepy!!!!! No one else\u2019s doctor is also!!! You ask why? cause mine wasn\u2019t!!!! BELIEVE MEEEEE!!!!!!\u201d", "Wrong.\n\n\nThe parent has to be in there and there's nothing weirder than going on a playdate with your friend and his mom checked your junk.", "Pls get off of Reddit for a moment and take a break.", "Sorry, but I won't even be alone in the room with a doctor with my genitals exposed. I am female and they *always* have a nurse in the room. Your suggestion that mom \"step out\" for *that part* is not something I'd be comfortable with. The \"extra person\" is to protect both doctor and patient.", "I feel like that should be included. I figured he had to at least go with since he stayed in the room with son, but her mentioning leaving work early to take son seemed like maybe it was on her", "We hardly argue and never in front of him. We spend more time together than most married parents. He doesn't even know about this.", "when quite young. it was based on immunization. thar os why i asked what country ?", "Exactly. Many diseases present themselves during childhood too", "where ?", "He's a second grader. Frankly not capable of self advocating. Sure, ask him a direct question. \n\nBut second graders would chose no physical at all, not understand things like insurance coverage, etc. \n\nBuild confidence in your kiddos, yes. But putting them in the middle of what's already a giant Flashpoint between his divorced parents? Nope.", "I tend not to go to the doctor at all if it's not a possibly broken bone or a gushing wound. And when I say Urgent Care, I don't mean the ER, I mean urgent care clinics that can see you without an appointment and have equipment on hand that my primary care physician may not have in their office, like x-ray machines. \n\nI have rolled my ankle and hurt my back on several occasions due to an issue with hypermobility. Going through my former PCP meant I then got a prescription for an x-ray, then made an appt with a separate facility for an x-ray, and then waited for the x-ray facility to send my PCP the results which took a lot more time to find out what the issue with my ankle was. Luckily it was not broken, but in the meantime my treatment was delayed. So I prefer urgent care to get that out of the way more quickly and then go see my PCP (or a specialist) for the follow-up care.\n\nAnd yes, don't go to the ER unless it is indeed an emergency. You'll waste their time and yours.", "Wow. Are we really talking about a 9 yo? \nThis is so so sad. I get that there are cultures where children are heavily sexualized but what you are implying is absolutely disgusting.", "So you're not going to ask him?", "In the US.  I can say for sure NY, and I'd imagine many other states as well.", "Not to be rude but I don\u2019t see how any part of this comment is relevant. \n\nYou don\u2019t go to the doctor regularly and yet have the need to tell OP what to do with his kid. Who regularly goes to his preferred doctor? What am I missing here?"]}
