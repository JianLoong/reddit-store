You broke rule 1 in friendships. You got involved when you should have stayed out of it. Not only are they enemies but now you got yourself tangled up in this. Friendships which go sour are inevitable. You want to stop the friendship from ending. Sometimes there is nothing you can do but sit back and let it go bad. I know young people want to save things but as you get older you will learn, nothing can be done for the most part.", "Yta. \u201cShe reminds me of my ex\u201d oh brother", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
