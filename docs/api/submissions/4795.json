{"id": 4795, "submission_id": "zmpu90", "title": "AITA for not giving up my part in a will?", "selftext": "I (18f) recently had a close friend of mine pass away. He was old, so I knew it was coming but it was still a shock. For some backstory, we had met while I was working in a bakery, he was a frequent guest and we always chatted while I helped him. I learned he was from Vietnam and I learned how to say \u201chave a good day\u201d in Vietnamese just for him. We eventually met up outside of my work and became fast friends. I\u2019ll call him Mr. N.\n\nWe\u2019d meet up and just chat for hours. He\u2019d teach me basic sentences in Vietnamese while I helped him with English. He\u2019d tell me stories of his life back in Vietnam, about his family. How he never had any children because his wife wasn\u2019t capable, and how his family practically disowned him for marrying a black woman. (it wasn\u2019t so much a problem that she was black, more that he wasn\u2019t marrying a Vietnamese woman). How I was like the child he never got to have. How he\u2019s sure his wife would have loved me. He even bought me an ao dai for my birthday. I loved it. I wish I could say goodbye one more time.\n\nA few weeks passed, and I had to go in for the reading of his will. The others were looking at me in confusion, since I\u2019m obviously not Vietnamese.\n\nDuring the reading Mr. N\u2019s siblings were left like 1k each. But he left me his estate and everything in it and 15k, along with enough money set aside to pay for my college. He gave it to me, instead of his family which made them quite upset. I can understand that, really, but I\u2019m also mad at them. This was their brother and they\u2019re whining about the money? If I could give it all up just to hug him one more time I would. But then again, what should I expect from people who gave up their brother so easily?\n\nThey tried to dispute the will, but it failed early on, with his lawyer confirming that Mr. N was of sound mind when making the will. They tried to claim that he was schizophrenic and couldn\u2019t have been in his right mind, but it was super easy to disprove that. He was in the hospital constantly, and I never saw any signs of schizophrenia and neither did any medical professionals. The only reason they even asked me was because I was the only person to have visited him, which broke my heart.\n\nEverything legal got dealt with, but his family confronted me after and basically demanded that I give up my portion of the will. They said that \u201cif I was a good person\u201d I would give them what was rightfully theirs. I snapped and told them if they really cared about family, they wouldn\u2019t have cut their brother off over him marrying a black woman. That if they really cared, they would have visited him in the hospital at least ONCE.\n\nI told my mother about this and she\u2019s saying that I should have been more forgiving, since they\u2019re grieving too. But I don\u2019t think they are, not truly at least. I do feel guilty that they aren\u2019t getting as much as me, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think they deserve it.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not giving up what was left to me in a will?", "created_utc": 1671123009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmpu90/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_part_in_a_will/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They deserted him and you were there for him. Take the money and enjoy life like he would have wanted you to", "YWBTA if you do give it up. Do not for any reason give it up.

Quite often, both families overlap, but not always which appears to be the case here: Mr. N choose you as part of \"his\" family, more than he choose the family he was born it, since that family basically outcasted him.  \nKeep the inheritance, if only for the symbol it represents: the love Mr. N had for you.", "NTA- he obviously cared about a great deal and I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nIt would seem you were the one who kept him company while they abandoned him.

He left it to YOU because you did more for him than alm his family put together.  He's been even too nice to leave anything to his family at all. It's not being \"family\" that gives you the rights on a person's hard worked money and estate, but what you have been for that person. Your friend's last wish was to leave you everything because you made a real difference in his life. By giving it away you would literally symbolise that his wishes don't matter. Don't do that to him.

His wish was clear and don\u2019t feel bad for him giving you something he wanted you to have. Don\u2019t allow anyone to take anything away from you or make you feel bad. He thought you was appreciative enough to have it so let it go. If they harass you get a restraining order.", "NTA he left them so little and you so much for a reason. They probably didn\u2019t spend much time with him or care for him when he was alive so what right do they have to anything after he\u2019s gone.

Screw his family", "NTA\n\nIts Mr. N's money, to do as he pleased. If he wanted to light a bonfire with it he could. And he chose to give to you. He had someone visiting him, and that's more than enough reason. \nI'm sorry for your lost.", "NTA. He wanted to leave his money to people who genuinely cared for him and about him.

You cared about him.  You were his friend and he probably considered you family more than his so-called siblings.  Family doesn't end at blood.  He was probably very grateful for the time he spent with you and that's why he left you his estate.  And that's all the reasoning you need to respect his wishes, and accept what he left you.", "Omg NTA. Not even a little. You brightened his life and now he has left you something so you can continue to have a bright future. What an amazing people you must both be.", "NTA he wanted you to have it, not them. His wishes should be honored.", "Not even close my dear.", "NTA. He had put you in his will with a sound mind. You didn't carouse him into anything. If his family haven't been a-holes to him for the majority of his life he would left more to them. They are just pissed that someone not blood-related got anything", "NTA. Sometimes you choose your family rather than are born into it.  He chose you.  And it looks like for good reason.", "NTA.  You're just learning that death can really bring out some really nasty aspects of people's personalities.   You were the daughter he always wanted, and he treated you accordingly in his will.  You were kind to a lonely old man when his own family failed him.", "NTA.\n\nThey weren't so much grieving as they were greedy.\n\nHe appreciated you for who you were, for being there for him, and he had the right to choose what to do with his estate. Out of respect for him, you should abide by his will.", "NTA. You wanting to give up the money to hug him one more time is why he gave it to you. You are empathetic and sympathetic. You showed him unconditional love & support when his \u201cfamily\u201d didn\u2019t. THAT is why he left the bulk of his estate to you.\n\nEventually, if you choose & can afford it after school, set up a scholarship in his name. Maybe talk to the attorney so you know what to plan on.", "NTA", "NTA,\nDon\u2019t budge. Those were Mr N last wishes\u2026.

His family had nothing to do with him while he was alive, didn't visit him in the hospital, but have the nerve to show up with their hand out after he dies? Hard no.", "NTA. He left it to you, as a final Goodbye to a friend. This is your Goodbye, he tried expressing how he felt in one final action. \n\nHonor his memory. Do with it what he intended. He knew exactly what he was doing, he had age and experience. You'll remember him forever, which is how it should be.", "NTA you reap what you sow. \nHe acknowledged your friendship and his family's limited role in his life. That'd not something for you to feel guilty for.", "NTA. It doesn't matter what you or his family think, the decision was his to make.\n\nThough your mum is right, they are grieving - grieving the loss of the money they thought was heading their way, not their relative.", "NTA they aren\u2019t grieving for him they are grieving the money they thought they would get from his death. He knew what he was doing and you clearly deserve the gift he gave you. Bringing someone joy at the end of their life is one of the greatest gifts you can give someone.", "LOL NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your friend, and to be quite blunt fuck those people. They only come around when there\u2019s something for them. Them never visiting in the hospital made me tear up. \n\nIf you really want to try and \u201cgive back\u201d I\u2019d suggest making a donation to a charity you believe your friend would appreciate. \n\nKeep being an amazing human being and good things will continue to come to you!", "NTA\n\nWills often bring out the worst in people", "NTA.   They are the family that he had.  You are the family that he wanted.", "NTA. Their behavior proves why Mr. N left the bulk of his estate to you: you and he cared about each other, they just wanted money.

Go to college, invest what's left over, and continue to be a caring and kind person you are. Feel no shame for taking money away from entitled AH.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you lost your friend :(. Sounds like he wished to pass his belongings onto a child, and you kind of ended up being that for him. \n\nHonor him by using everything he gave you wisely!", "NTA, but just for future reference you wouldn't usually refer to someone's fertility difficulties as not being \"capable\" of having children. You can just say she/they were \"unable\" instead. It's a subtle difference but the latter has less blame attached.", "NTA\n\nAlso, you can be forgiving and still keep the money.\n\nYour friend went out of his way to make sure you inherit everything. Don't shit on his dying wish.", "NTA.\n\nIn fact, it's my understanding that their are some protections in the law for \"next of kin.\" So the fact that they were unable to prevail against you is an indication that your friend took extra and very deliberate steps to ensure his estate would go to you. He really, strongly wanted you to have it.", "NTA, in fact, you\u2018d go against your friend\u2019s will if you did. They\u2019re not grieving, they\u2019re only sad they\u2019re not getting the money they were hoping for. If they had loved him, they would\u2019ve shown that while he was alive. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and I hope you don\u2019t let those greedy AHs get to you. Your friend wanted to help with your education because he loved you like family. Blood doesn\u2019t matter.", "This story is sus, but if it is actually true then NTA.", "NTA. They didn't care about him, they cared about the money. HE cared about YOU because you cared about him, and it showed. You were there for him when his \"family\" had written him off and I'm sure he was lonely, he told you himself that you were like a daughter to him, so when he made his will, he left the bulk of it to you who had given your time and love to him instead of his family who did not even show up towards the end.\n\nGiving in to them would not be what he would want.", "Huh.

His family is grieving the fact they didn't get his money, not Mr. N himself.\n\nYou sound like a lovely young person and I'm so glad Mr. N had you in his life. Use the money the make the life you want for yourself and make him proud.", "NTA. They are grieving over the money not the man. Sad. Keep that money!", "NTA The answer in these cases is ALWAYS Not The Asshole. It was his money to do with as he pleased, he chose to leave it to someone who was kind to him when he was lonely instead of spending it on vacations or donating it to charity.  \n\n\nYou don't have a relationship with these people. Ask them if there are any family heirlooms or sentimental items they want, offer them any family photos you find in the house, and then block them on social media and their numbers on your phone. If part of the estate was a house I'd recommend selling it and starting over somewhere else so they can't harass you in person.", "NTA - he wanted you to have it because he knew you cared about him. Check out the movie Grand Torino. Different story, but similiar sentiment.", "NTA. He gave it to you for a reason. Put the money to good use.", "NTA as a South Asian person I have seen this money thing repeat with several families. Those people are like vultures, you don't need to give them even 1 dollor. Stick to it.", "NTA.  There's a reason he gave it to you and not them. that reason being you actually cared about him.\n\nYou talk to him hang out with him. he cared for you just like you cared for him.\n\n he knew what kind of family he had that's why he left it to you.\n\nYou might feel bad about all this but they brought it on themselves. \n\nHe didn't want to give it to his family but he wanted to give it to you.", "My dear girl. You gave that man more love and kindness than his family, there at the end especially. He chose you as his daughter and he wanted you to be cared for and to go on to build an excellent life for yourself. YWBTA if you dishonored his wishes and love by giving it away to people who he clearly felt did not deserve it. You're NTA, and don't let people guilt you. The *block* button exists for a reason. Take care of yourself. Remember him fondly and go do great things. I'm so, so sorry for your loss, I know no amount of money can heal that hole, only time <3", ">I told my mother about this and she\u2019s saying that I should have been more forgiving, since they\u2019re grieving too.\n\nNo, that's a silly mindset. They deserve *nothing*. They're lucky they got the token $1k each lool\n\nNTA - you clearly had a connection with Mr N that he greatly appreciated.", "He knew exactly what he was doing.  Use your inheritance to further yourself.  You will be fulfilling how he wanted to be remembered & how he wanted his life's funds to be spent.", "NTA but you will be if you go aaist his will.  He worked hard to make sure they couldn't contest it and to give his estate to somone who actually cared about him forwho he was.  You brought family and friendship to the end of his life and he wanted to give you a thankyou.  His bio family is only intrested in his money do nit give in to them", "NTA. Go to college and honor his memory by being you. You made a big difference in his life, and I\u2019m glad he passed with someone who cared for him.", "NTA, not even a little. \n\n1. He wrote that will when he was alive to decide how his estate would be handled after this death. This is his right and it sounds like he was very clear.\n2. It sounds like his family is lucky to have had anything at all and not be completely cut out. Sounds like your friend was a really good guy. \n3. It sounds like he had his wife in mind while he made the will: you were the kid they never had, and he knew she would have loved that you were taken care of. \n\nMy advice? Go to school with the money, and then do something good in the world with part of the rest of it. Pay his love for you forward!", "Nta. Legally it's yours, they can f off.", "NTA\n\nThey're greedy, not grieving.", "NTA - Tell your mother they\u2019re not grieving the man, they\u2019re grieving the money.", "I live half the world away from my parents. A friendship in their twilight years like the one you described would give me so much peace and happiness. If his siblings cared for him at all, they would be grateful for the happiness you brought him. \n\nYou gave your friend one of the most meaningful gifts you can give, your time and love. Never let anyone cheapen or dismiss that op, you deserve everything he left you, and that's what he thought too.\n\nOh and NTA", "NTA. \n\nMr N had a will. That's the end of it. \n\nMy father's girlfriend tried this same shit. It was all about the money. Luckily my father had a will.", ">They said that \u201cif I was a good person\u201d I would give them what was rightfully theirs.\n\nThe thing is, you WERE the good person, which is why Mr. N left you his estate.\n\nNTA.  Mr. N's wishes were that you get his estate, not his family.  Respect *his* wishes, not their demands.\n\nediting to add:  I love the story of your relationship and that you valued one another so much.  I'm sorry you've lost Mr. N and send you love.", "NTA - they are not grieving, they are just thieving. Their lack of involvement in his life is precisely why HE CHOSE to give you what mattered to him, instead of them.\n\nHe made his choice. Honor him by sticking to it.", "NTA. I think your mom *meant* to say \"greedy\" instead of \"grieving.\"", "NTA.\n\nYour friend choose to leave you his property.  He had reasons for the choice and you should honor that choice. That means do not give them your inheritance. Enjoy it, go to college and make him proud.\n\nHave a wonderful life", "NTA you are absolutely right they don't care that he died they only care that they didn't get all of his money. The only reason they got 1k each is because that's the legal amount to be given to blood related family so they can't dispute it when they die. Meaning if he had it his way they would all get absolutely nothing. Giving them money now would be a spit in the face to Mr N.", "NTA.  Your friendship brought a tear to my eye.  You meant more to Mr. N than any amount of money.  Don't you dare not take the money and use it to make a life for yourself that would delight Mr. N.", "You are learning that death can actually bring out some really bad sides in people's personalities. When a lonely old man was abandoned by his family, you were kind to him.", "He wanted this for a reason. These people's pressure on you to satisfy their selfish desires will dishonor his memory.", "NTA. Just want to add that I'm glad he had you to share the little time he had left. He found more family in a complete stranger and becoming fast friends with, than his own family. You sound like a great person and truly cared about him. I truly wish more people cared more about the person than the size of the share of inheritance they could receive from someone's death.", "This.\n\nNta", "IMHO, he did leave the money to his family.\n\nJust not folks he was biologically related to.", "Exactly this OP. For all intents and purposes, you were his family.", "They are grieving for the money they lost, not the person they lost."]}
