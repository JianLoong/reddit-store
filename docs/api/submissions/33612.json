Children of alcoholics are at a higher risk of developing an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and other substances. Children of alcoholics are at a higher risk of being put in dangerous situations. \n\nMy advice is to leave and never ever let your ex be alone with your daughter. When you leave, he will spiral. He will drink more because no one is there to guilt him into being sober. He will get new shitty friends that also has substance abuse problems. He will bring them around your daughter. His judgment will be impaired by all the alcohol. And if he pass out, your daughter will be alone with dad\u2019s new, shitty friends.

Whatever happens to him if you leave is not your fault. He is responsible for himself. He needs to want to get clean. \n\nYour responsibility is to protect your daughter. She is the child.
