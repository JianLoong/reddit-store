The party consisted of Adam(53m), Adam's wife(49f), Bryn(47m), Bryn's wife(49f), Claire(52f), Daisy(50f) and me (37f). Not sure if ages are relevant but added anyway.\n\nBit of back story: I've worked for the company for just under a year so this is my first Christmas do with this company. As a whole, we all work together well and they seem to be a fairly good company, I just don't get on with Claire very well. I'm polite and professional but she is a quite lazy and slacks off at work and expects others to pick up the slack. She also really likes to be the centre of attention. It's quite a skill with how well she can pivot a conversation to something she wants to talk about. She is also very aware that I really don't like being touched, especially when it's unexpected. It makes my skin prickle and gives me shivers, I don't know why but it is what it is.\n\nLast night she started getting touchy feely with me. It started with putting her hand on my shoulder to talk to me, then putting her hand on my neck and pulling me close to her, then feeling my neck. Each time I'd politely tell her to let me go and move her hand. She then stood in front of me, slid her hands up my neck and the back of my head and locked her fingers in my hair, pulled me close and rested her forehead on mine. I wriggled free and told her to please stop, she's making me uncomfortable. She then put her arm around me and started stroking my neck. I pushed her off and said \"Claire, stop touching me, I've told you multiple times to stop\". She got upset and walked off.\n\nThe next thing, someone strokes the back of my head. I swing round and grab the arm. It was Bryn and he was apologising saying Claire said to stroke my hair and see what I do. He apologised over and over and said he had no idea it would distress me.\n\nThen two hands grabbed my shoulders from behind. This time it was Adam, he laughed and said Claire has been telling everyone to touch me to see what I do. I said she was a dick, she knows I hate being touched, she wouldn't leave me alone and I shouted in the end to get her away from me. He said I was being dramatic. I explained as above what she had been doing. \n\nBryn came over to apologise again, and offered a fist bump, which I accepted.\n\nThere was an ongoing argument the whole ride home, only Bryn and Adam's wife were on my side. The others said I was dramatic. I genuinely am baffled.

You asked her to stop and she didn't.

Claire sucks.", "Wft, you're describing a group assault. NTA", "NTA.~~File a complaint with Human Resources.~~ Meet with your attorney before you have a formal session with your boss to discuss this incident. You, a mature HR professional, don\u2019t know how to react to this drunken harassment. And if they treat *you* this way, how are they treating lower ranking female staff?
