The party consisted of Adam(53m), Adam's wife(49f), Bryn(47m), Bryn's wife(49f), Claire(52f), Daisy(50f) and me (37f). Not sure if ages are relevant but added anyway.\n\nBit of back story: I've worked for the company for just under a year so this is my first Christmas do with this company. As a whole, we all work together well and they seem to be a fairly good company, I just don't get on with Claire very well. I'm polite and professional but she is a quite lazy and slacks off at work and expects others to pick up the slack. She also really likes to be the centre of attention. It's quite a skill with how well she can pivot a conversation to something she wants to talk about. She is also very aware that I really don't like being touched, especially when it's unexpected. It makes my skin prickle and gives me shivers, I don't know why but it is what it is.\n\nLast night she started getting touchy feely with me. It started with putting her hand on my shoulder to talk to me, then putting her hand on my neck and pulling me close to her, then feeling my neck. Each time I'd politely tell her to let me go and move her hand. She then stood in front of me, slid her hands up my neck and the back of my head and locked her fingers in my hair, pulled me close and rested her forehead on mine. I wriggled free and told her to please stop, she's making me uncomfortable. She then put her arm around me and started stroking my neck. I pushed her off and said \"Claire, stop touching me, I've told you multiple times to stop\". She got upset and walked off.\n\nThe next thing, someone strokes the back of my head. I swing round and grab the arm. It was Bryn and he was apologising saying Claire said to stroke my hair and see what I do. He apologised over and over and said he had no idea it would distress me.\n\nThen two hands grabbed my shoulders from behind. This time it was Adam, he laughed and said Claire has been telling everyone to touch me to see what I do. I said she was a dick, she knows I hate being touched, she wouldn't leave me alone and I shouted in the end to get her away from me. He said I was being dramatic. I explained as above what she had been doing. \n\nBryn came over to apologise again, and offered a fist bump, which I accepted.\n\nThere was an ongoing argument the whole ride home, only Bryn and Adam's wife were on my side. The others said I was dramatic. I genuinely am baffled. So aita for not wanting my colleagues touching my body?\n\n##edit: I am the company HR manager.

Idk if that's the right word.", "Sexual harassment and bullying, imo - there was a toxic mix of both going on there. I would also pull in the company owner and the company lawyer on this one. You are currently in a position with witnesses to demonstrate a deliberate sexual harassment campaign that was actively participated in and encouraged by the manager. This. Is. BAD. Though... honestly before the company lawyer, you might even go talk to a lawyer yourself first and discuss whether to talk to the company lawyer yourself, or if it's in your best interest to have your lawyer draft a letter regarding the incident (or anything else they might suggest), and present that to the boss and co lawyer to address with the employees in question as they see fit.\n\nAt any rate, this must have made for an awful experience for you.

People can behave very badly when it is their job on the line or they see an opportunity to curry favor.

Don't count on anyone to back you up if there's a chance it will hurt their standing in the office. \n\nAs for dealing with Claire directly, only you know what is in keeping with your office's tone and what you're comfortable saying. Claire's type of mean spirited teasing cuts both ways. If you end up in a situation where she's touches you again, you could freeze her out or you could go dramatic (they're already calling you dramatic anyway) -  you could say to her, loudly, \"Claire, NO! That is a NO\" like she's a bad dog (without actually saying \"bad dog!\"). Hopefully it will embarrass her, and if she complains you can tell her you were \"just joking.\" I bet she wouldn't like being called the office's designated creeper, or hearing the reason she keeps people who say no is because she can't find anyone to say yes, etc.", "Hope things go well :)", "Not turn a blind eye.

She keeps calling herself a dog whisperer so it'd be very fitting.", "Please do report it. My sister was violently r*ped after a works drinks do and a huge reason that some didn't believe her from the office was that they'd been him touching and flirting with her. They'd all seen her say a firm no multiple times but they thought because he kept going back to her it was all harmless. \n Until people went and she was suddenly alone and being brutally attacked.  Women are the least likely to support women and regardless of the gender or sexuality of the perpetrator it isn't acceptable. No is a complete sentence so we have to work hard to get people to recognize this and make a safer world for ourselves and our daughters.", "Good! Where i work, that person would have been fired already.", "You're younger, likely prettier because of it, and probably not as overbearing and therefore more approachable. \n\nFor people like clair, that's a threat to be taken down.", "Yes you should follow the policies and procedures like you would like it happened to someone else from the team. \n\nINFO Do you have an employee assistance program/service? \n\nIt might help for you to talk with someone about what happened/Claire\u2019s behaviour and even help prepare before having conversations with Adam or Claire. Obviously the HR manager needs to be professional and appropriate but you have difficulty managing your emotion response given you as the victim of this harassment.", "I was just discussing this with my husband and he concurred. Claire pulled an actual literal dominance power move on you when she locked her hands behind your head.\n\nOne of my (late) bull terriers would pull a very similar move. As soon as a guest would sit down on the sofa, she'd hop up and perch on the back of the sofa behind them and put her two paws on top of the guest's head. The rest her head on her paws like she was the head of the guest's body. \\[Don't ask why I would let this happen, I'm ridiculous\\]. She wouldn't move, I'd have to pick her up carry her away. Claire pulled an actual honest-to-goodness animal kingdom-type pack hierarchy move, like something a dog would do. \n\nThis may be the real reason most of your office mates backed her up instead of you; not because what she didn't wasn't wrong (it was!), but because people gravitate towards the person with power and align against the person seen as weaker. Nobody wants to be the next victim.\n\nIf you end up having to handle this on your own, I think the key might be to turn the tables on Claire so that she ends up being the one who is belittled (\"Claire, use your words, not your hands!\" in a school teacher voice) and the group sees you won't be bullied.\n\nOn a total different note - is it possible Adam's wife backed you up because she's seen Claire get handsy with office mates before, namely Adam? You're not working with a bunch of swingers are you? Because that's a whole different ball of wax.", "Hmm. You might be onto something. She does keep comparing bodies which is really weird. Me and the boss are very active peope. We weight train and hike (not together, just a shared interest) and if ever we discuss anything we've been doing/focusing on, she has to pivot the conversation", "Haha excellent!

Nip this in the bud fast!!!! Could you have an attorney write Clair a letter and CC it to your boss that you do not want any sexual touching happening.
