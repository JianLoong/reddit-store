The party consisted of Adam(53m), Adam's wife(49f), Bryn(47m), Bryn's wife(49f), Claire(52f), Daisy(50f) and me (37f). Not sure if ages are relevant but added anyway.\n\nBit of back story: I've worked for the company for just under a year so this is my first Christmas do with this company. As a whole, we all work together well and they seem to be a fairly good company, I just don't get on with Claire very well. I'm polite and professional but she is a quite lazy and slacks off at work and expects others to pick up the slack. She also really likes to be the centre of attention. It's quite a skill with how well she can pivot a conversation to something she wants to talk about. She is also very aware that I really don't like being touched, especially when it's unexpected. It makes my skin prickle and gives me shivers, I don't know why but it is what it is.\n\nLast night she started getting touchy feely with me. It started with putting her hand on my shoulder to talk to me, then putting her hand on my neck and pulling me close to her, then feeling my neck. Each time I'd politely tell her to let me go and move her hand. She then stood in front of me, slid her hands up my neck and the back of my head and locked her fingers in my hair, pulled me close and rested her forehead on mine. I wriggled free and told her to please stop, she's making me uncomfortable. She then put her arm around me and started stroking my neck. I pushed her off and said \"Claire, stop touching me, I've told you multiple times to stop\". She got upset and walked off.\n\nThe next thing, someone strokes the back of my head. I swing round and grab the arm. It was Bryn and he was apologising saying Claire said to stroke my hair and see what I do. He apologised over and over and said he had no idea it would distress me.\n\nThen two hands grabbed my shoulders from behind. This time it was Adam, he laughed and said Claire has been telling everyone to touch me to see what I do. I said she was a dick, she knows I hate being touched, she wouldn't leave me alone and I shouted in the end to get her away from me. He said I was being dramatic. I explained as above what she had been doing. \n\nBryn came over to apologise again, and offered a fist bump, which I accepted.\n\nThere was an ongoing argument the whole ride home, only Bryn and Adam's wife were on my side. The others said I was dramatic. I genuinely am baffled. So aita for not wanting my colleagues touching my body?\n\n##edit: I am the company HR manager.

A clear head, accurate and detailed notes, and the fact that you're absolutely in the right should make this an open and shut case. Good luck! Also, I know lots of people that don't like to be touched, especially unexpectedly. When I meet or leave from them, I say \"air hugs\" or something like that because CONSENT!", "I don't mean this to sound rude but how are you an HR Manager? Isn't this like on page 1 of HR 101? \n\nWith that said very much NTA. These people are outrageously rude and are harassing you. It's insane they'd they do this to anyone but to do it to an HR person is even more baffling. They deserve to be fired. Absolutely appalling behavior.", "It is almost always harder to advocate for yourself when it's dealing with a bad thing and not a positive. Lots of positive energy. You've got this.", "Ask for the footage from the venue. Explain there was an HR incident between two employees that needs addressing.", "But her boss is Adam, he was part of the harassment and then told OP she was being dramatic. She needs to find a way to report this with him sabotaging her. \n\nWould be good for OP to also figure out Claire's relationships within the company.", "I can't believe I didn't even think about this aspect!! Now I'm mad all over again. I do not want my team to think we just let this happen. I'd be devastated if someone didn't report being harassed because they thought we turned a blind eye to it.", "Ooh OK, I'll try and do that now. Thank you", "I'm really not sure what there is to be jealous about. We all have our jobs to do and we get on with them. She does struggle and gets behind (she struggles to focus) so some of her work gets passed to me and Daisy to catch her up.", "I thought about this today actually. He has been so supportive and reasonable until now. It could go either way I guess.", "Yeah, definitely shocked. I feel rather stupid now though because my head has cleared and procedure has kicked in mentally so I'm starting the process.", "I'm a terrible HR manager, I support my staff and protect them from the bosses. I give out my direct line number to staff so if they have any concerns or just want to vent about an annoying situation, they can (and they do). \n\nBut in all seriousness, I know I need to get my head straight and follow procedure here. I just could not work out why I was being called the arsehole here.", "Where the harassment occurred is irrelevant.", "If Claire was a man, it would have been seen as clear sexual harassement. Documente everything, ask everyone their testimony and show Claire that you consider this as an incident which won't have consequences yet, but can if she does it again to you or anyone else. \n\nI am pretty sure that it's the kind of strange move some kids do with their teacher, to be the little favorite or their worst nightmare. It's a way to prove \"I can trick the most important person in the group to like me\", and will probably get worst with time. You need to put a clear stop. NTA.", "NTA. Definitely get in contact with the company owner and get this reported.", "Holy shit. I am stressed reading this! This is so incredibly inappropriate! Absolutely NTA!!", "NTA. Claire is a troublemaker. She should be written up. Shut that shit down.", "NTA. \"Do not touch me\" is a whole and complete sentence. To ignore that \"to see what you will do\" is middle-school behaviour, not the actions of adults in their damn *fifties*. And furthermore, the kinds of touches they were using were not the kind coworkers would even use. That's the level of touch you expect from close families or a life partner.", "NTA\n\nThis is sexual harassment. If the roles were reversed you would most likely be fired for this type of behavior. Just because it is a woman harassing a man does not make this acceptable behavior in any circumstance. Plain and simple no is no.", "I agree with everyone else but also think you should take this TO your boss and have them write it up since you are an employee and the victim NTA", "what the fuck!!!! as someone who also fucking hates ppl touching me unexpectedly, i feel for you so hard. i am so sorry almost everyone around you sucks shit", "NTA.  Demand they hire a third party to adjudicate because you've got to fire Claire", "NTA And you definitely should file a complaint with your HR department. Not only was she basically physically assaulting you, but encouraging everyone else to do it too. She sounds unhinged.", "Good god definitely NTA but leave that company. She is a dick evidently but if your boss isn't even taking it seriously where do you go from there? Run while you can.", "Nta\n\nI'm an old man and I hate to be touched.  I'm at the point now where I just hurt people when they touch me.  So I don't go in public much anymore.", "NTA. respect people's boundaries. It's basic courtesy and intentionally causing problems just to get a rise out of someone makes you an Ass.", "NTA\n\nGET A LAWYER. Since Adam is your boss and was involved in this issue, you need to obtain your own separate legal counsel immediately. Do not discuss the issue without your lawyer present and have your lawyer be the one to make your intentions known, and that he may not speak to you about the issue alone at any time. Seriously, no private conversations with anyone involved, not even Bryn. You should decline to say ANYTHING to anyone about the issue in the absence of legal counsel.", "Yes, I'm going to insist everyone does a sexual harassment course.", "Right on the fucking money. I am ENRAGED on your behalf OP. I have to resist the urge to get violent when people repeatedly disrespect my personal space. I really do not like being touched and I am vocal and polite most of the time about this fact. I have definitely shouted at people before for repeatedly touching me. If gender roles were reversed people would have no issue with your coworkers being punished. But \u201cBeCaUsE yOuR a MaN\u201d you can\u2019t be sexually harassed or assaulted? Horseshit. Go to bat for yourself! Fight for this or they will never respect your boundaries. Or start looking for another job. You deserve better.", "LOL, you're so right. Claire decided to harass the *HR manager.* Claire is not bright.", "You're right. Got my HR hat on now. I'm on it!", "If you are indeed the HR manager then shouldn\u2019t you be aware of the company policy? Why are you allowing this? They don\u2019t have any reason or right to touch you. The whole thing just seems very strange now. If you\u2019re an HR manager you would know what your rights are. You would know what the procedure is. And you should know what to do. What are you gonna do about this?", "Well. Shit. Idk.", "That's exactly why people go to hr, because even if they normally know what to do, being in the situation... Clouds judgement? Idk if that's the right word.", "Sexual harassment and bullying, imo - there was a toxic mix of both going on there. I would also pull in the company owner and the company lawyer on this one. You are currently in a position with witnesses to demonstrate a deliberate sexual harassment campaign that was actively participated in and encouraged by the manager. This. Is. BAD. Though... honestly before the company lawyer, you might even go talk to a lawyer yourself first and discuss whether to talk to the company lawyer yourself, or if it's in your best interest to have your lawyer draft a letter regarding the incident (or anything else they might suggest), and present that to the boss and co lawyer to address with the employees in question as they see fit.\n\nAt any rate, this must have made for an awful experience for you. I'm really sorry they did that.", "I've seen way more than my fair share of bad behavior in the workplace, and that includes a lot of betrayal. People can behave very badly when it is their job on the line or they see an opportunity to curry favor. Try to visualize different outcomes - what do you want to see happen - and think about who has leverage to make it happen as well as who would feel threatened. Don't count on anyone to back you up if there's a chance it will hurt their standing in the office. \n\nAs for dealing with Claire directly, only you know what is in keeping with your office's tone and what you're comfortable saying. Claire's type of mean spirited teasing cuts both ways. If you end up in a situation where she's touches you again, you could freeze her out or you could go dramatic (they're already calling you dramatic anyway) -  you could say to her, loudly, \"Claire, NO! That is a NO\" like she's a bad dog (without actually saying \"bad dog!\"). Hopefully it will embarrass her, and if she complains you can tell her you were \"just joking.\" I bet she wouldn't like being called the office's designated creeper, or hearing the reason she keeps people who say no is because she can't find anyone to say yes, etc.", "Hope things go well :)", "Not turn a blind eye. I'm going to put my HR hat back on and I'm going to follow procedure, just like I'd do if any of my team were foing through this. Got a bit lost but I'm back on track", "Yeah, my head was so muddled I forgot the policies and procedures are there for me too. Got my HR hat back on now!", "I so want to say bad dog to her haha. She keeps calling herself a dog whisperer so it'd be very fitting.", "Please do report it. My sister was violently r*ped after a works drinks do and a huge reason that some didn't believe her from the office was that they'd been him touching and flirting with her. They'd all seen her say a firm no multiple times but they thought because he kept going back to her it was all harmless. \n Until people went and she was suddenly alone and being brutally attacked.  Women are the least likely to support women and regardless of the gender or sexuality of the perpetrator it isn't acceptable. No is a complete sentence so we have to work hard to get people to recognize this and make a safer world for ourselves and our daughters.", "Good! Where i work, that person would have been fired already.", "You're younger, likely prettier because of it, and probably not as overbearing and therefore more approachable. \n\nFor people like clair, that's a threat to be taken down.", "Yes you should follow the policies and procedures like you would like it happened to someone else from the team. \n\nINFO Do you have an employee assistance program/service? \n\nIt might help for you to talk with someone about what happened/Claire\u2019s behaviour and even help prepare before having conversations with Adam or Claire. Obviously the HR manager needs to be professional and appropriate but you have difficulty managing your emotion response given you as the victim of this harassment.", "I was just discussing this with my husband and he concurred. Claire pulled an actual literal dominance power move on you when she locked her hands behind your head.\n\nOne of my (late) bull terriers would pull a very similar move. As soon as a guest would sit down on the sofa, she'd hop up and perch on the back of the sofa behind them and put her two paws on top of the guest's head. The rest her head on her paws like she was the head of the guest's body. \\[Don't ask why I would let this happen, I'm ridiculous\\]. She wouldn't move, I'd have to pick her up carry her away. Claire pulled an actual honest-to-goodness animal kingdom-type pack hierarchy move, like something a dog would do. \n\nThis may be the real reason most of your office mates backed her up instead of you; not because what she didn't wasn't wrong (it was!), but because people gravitate towards the person with power and align against the person seen as weaker. Nobody wants to be the next victim.\n\nIf you end up having to handle this on your own, I think the key might be to turn the tables on Claire so that she ends up being the one who is belittled (\"Claire, use your words, not your hands!\" in a school teacher voice) and the group sees you won't be bullied.\n\nOn a total different note - is it possible Adam's wife backed you up because she's seen Claire get handsy with office mates before, namely Adam? You're not working with a bunch of swingers are you? Because that's a whole different ball of wax.", "Hmm. You might be onto something. She does keep comparing bodies which is really weird. Me and the boss are very active peope. We weight train and hike (not together, just a shared interest) and if ever we discuss anything we've been doing/focusing on, she has to pivot the conversation", "Haha excellent! Yes, Claire can get very handsy with Adam and it drives his wife nuts."]}
