We met later in life and I\u2019m almost 50 and I have 3 boys from my ex.\n\nWhen my body could not carry his baby, I offered for him to leave and find happiness with someone that could have his baby.

Since then, I have assumed we were family and it was the 5 of us and I have built our family and our relationship on us and plans for just us into our old age.\n\nSo, I did not take it well.  I brought up a lot of unhealed pain of losing a baby with him in the beginning.  We have fought almost non-stop since this has come up.  At this stage, I can almost say with certainty I do not want some extended family, baby at 53 yo, share my husband and fund him having another family.  I can only assume that he would chose being with the baby and subsequently the woman (who is single and he doesn't see any issue with this) over us, in any instant if the baby or she needed him.\n\nI am overwhelmed and have been struggling to trust him.  I feel this is betrayal and deceit.  I don't know this woman and now wonder what he's been saying to initiate this and who else he has floated around the idea that he is open to having kids, being the fun uncle, splitting a baby (they discussed percentages of time)!  This has opened something in him that will never be satisfied with me and our kids because this need for a bio-baby is so strong now.   It\u2019s been a few weeks and feel like this marriage is over.  I dont see how I can come back from this betrayal and how he could come back from NOT wanting this.  He has said \"this is an opporunity for him to have the best of both worlds\".\n\nAITA for not being open to supporting him?  I have said to him to explore his options despite me and my emotions because I don't even know if I can be with him any longer.  I now can't trust him or that this will ever be over.

Have I lost a reason and perspective?\n   1. See above. Yes, maybe a bit.\n3. Is this the world now - no loyalty for family?\n   1. This one I get, and that feeling is part of why you're not open to it, because it would involve him developing a psuedo family outside of your marriage. For some people, this can be done, for others not so much. If it's a boundary for you, and he's aware of that, it's totally reasonable you'd be upset.\n4.

OP should contact the woman to get the truth.", "Um.  Yeah, NTA.\n\nThe only way I'd entertain such an idea would be if my wife were on board (most important factor), if it were done in vitro (non-negotiable), and if it were promised to be anonymous (eg. nobody told who bio dad was, at least until kid's adulthood).", "Thank you", "Thank you", "I am really sorry to hear that you understand this exactly.

Because if he\u2019s hoping you fund his baby with her, I would immediately separate money and look into talking with a lawyer about divorce. Books be a reason she\u2019s after him too.

Well, hopefully he can reconcile his job with the upbringing of HIS child... All that's missing is that you should supervise this child while he sleeps or goes to work.

She doesn\u2019t want full time parenting and nor does he (a whole other things). Financial and legal parts they have discussed but he has not shared with me. They have met and talked these details  without me, hence, where my mistrust and betrayal come in.", "My gut tells me that because she is single as well, there could be ulterior motives here.  Having his baby would be a sure way of keeping him there - easily and especially if she knows he has wanted this so badly.", "Well he is an AH. He made a promise to her by marrying her and choosing to stay with her and her children.\n\nHe is a MAJOR AH for putting her through this instead of just opting out way earlier.\nThis is betrayal.", "OP never said she didn't want another child, she *can't have* another child. \nIf his desire to have a baby is more important than his current family, then he should have ended it *before* he had detailed co-parenting conversations with the other woman.

What the actual F!", "I mentioned this above:    \nEven with counselling, I believe this \u201copportunity\u201d or his need for genetic offspring will never be settled for him.  If I stayed, I would be constantly unsettled, waiting for the next woman or opportunity to rear its head...in 2 years, 5 years, 10 years....  \r  \n\r  \nAnd what answers do I really need someone to tell me when I know he wants a baby and has, unconsciously, subconsciously, openly brought this into our lives? \n\nHe is a person who does not know himself, he is a person that his need surpasses all else and he is a person whose promises and commitment are secondary.  This is seen because even with me being so broken by this, he continues to discuss this with her.", "Thank you!!!", "OMG!  Your poor friend!", "It is hard for sure.  \nShe is not a lesbian but would make this a bit easier for sure where she actually may not be \u201cafter\u201d him!

I am pulling back from pettiness and anger and hurt and focusing on listening and observing and healing to make a good, clear choice for me and the kids.  \n\nAnd heck, live an amazing life free of drama and diapers!", "No she didn't.  She said break up with me and have a baby.  Not cheat on me, have a baby, and then we can be coparents with your affair partner.", "Thank you.  I appreciate your perspective.  \n\nThe betrayal is not that he asked but that he is even entertaining this after having opportunities to do this before (not in our mid-50's).  The betrayal was how it was presented - who is this woman and how could she think it was okay to ask which leads to what has he said to make this okay?  This is not a random comment (IMO).  \n\nI feel betrayed because at this stage it is an US thing and his inability to protect us and his current family and this need of his will not end.  \n\nAnd the new betrayal is, as you eluded to, that he is not ready to let it go and it is happening outside of me (before I made my final \"you have to make a decision for yourself and not because of me or the kids because you will live with regret and resentment.  I can already see regret and resentment happening because I was not able to have his baby (calls me a liar and that I deceived him) after I lost our baby in the first few years.", "I think what OP is mostly upset with is that he didn't just ask \"hey how would you feel if I had a baby I could coparent with someone else?\" It was that he had a whole in-depth conversation with another woman about impregnating her and raising a baby with her, discussing time and financials, and then brought it up to OP. Especially after reassuring OP he was happy with their current family. That alone is a betrayal, the fact he blindsided her with it, and went behind her back to meet with another woman to do this. These are the things that are decided as a family, and with your spouse.", "I can understand that he is not an asshole for asking.  And yes there are some unique family set ups but this was not my future plan after I very clearly gave him an out years ago when I couldn\u2019t conceive and again most recently because this may be his second chance.  \nI know this most recent go sow your seed may sound crazy but I think this is because I am mostly out and don\u2019t know how to come back from this and if he is free he can actually have something he has always wanted (more than me and us). Saying with with love to him. \n\nThe betrayal more comes from how this all came about - how does one have a conversation about this that this woman would think this is an option?  Who else thinks this is an option?  \nThe assholeness comes from his promised me and to this family that this was our life and future.  I totally get things change and stuff comes up unexpectedly but me and the kids had put a crap ton of hope and expectation that this was our unit and our future together with the expectation of him to defend us and his family above most things.  But here is the one thing that is above the promise.  This is my hurt speaking.  And I know this because the conversations are still happening even before I said you should explore this for your self because this will never be settled for you and he agreed.  \n\nI appreciate your perspective and comments.", "I actually very much agree with you...which is why I gave him the option when this came up previously (after I lost our baby) and in the last few weeks.  I do know what it's like and would not want him to be denied this opportunity. \n\nMy challenge with your consideration is that how can he stop being there for a child he has always wanted at 5%? 20%?  or whatever split they decide?  I have dreamt of us growing old, but not him leaving our bed at 2 am because his baby's mother is sick or she needs him and his help, or baby won't stop crying or is sick?  I have to be very clear that this is a very huge possibility for at least the next 10-18 years of my life if I stay.  How could I deny him that?  Of course, I wouldn't if I actively chose to go down this path with him.  And she is single - what about all the times I don't go or cannot be there because of the other 3 kids or work or whatever the situation is - what happens that she is lonely and starts feeling for him or him her?  Hormones are high and I dont know her for a rock...it is another possibility.   \n\nLots of thoughts and unknowns...", "I actually very much agree with you...and it was out of love and support when I gave him the option to find someone that could give him a baby after I lost our baby and found out I couldn't have anymore and AGAIN in the last few weeks to make sure he makes the decisions for himself so there is no regret or resentment.  I do know what it's like to have kids, and AGAIN, I would give this up rather than deny him this opportunity. \n\nI agree that some of this could be based on insecurity and fear, but also the broken promises and my whole world shaken and unknown, and the future that WE both talked about may be very different - which was about me and him, not me and him and her and baby.  I understand this sounds cold, but he actively and purposefully chose me and the kids as his family then.  Other options don't involve a whole other pseudo family that I am not clear if I am expected to financially or emotionally (because I would be losing a part of my husband (the flip side, I would gain another woman and another dependant in my mid 50's to my family)) support.  \n\nI am still processing all this...", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
