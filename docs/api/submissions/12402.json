You weren't asked if the little old lady could run away with your umbrella like a mischievous storm imp. You were asked to share your umbrella with a little old lady who had none, in heavy rain. You admit yourself in comments that if you just stood near her, you could have covered both of you with the umbrella at once. You weren't parting ways. You weren't walking and needing to keep pace with each other. You were stationary at a bus stop. Share the umbrella.\n\nP.P.S. I first read (and internalized) that poem as a teenager, in a book targeted at teenagers. Apparently even at my rudest, moodiest, and most emotionally toxic life stage, I was still somehow further ahead than you currently are as a 32M. That's not praise of myself. That's a sad, sad reflection on you. Do better. Please, do better. The world is sadder with you acting the way you're currently acting, and will be better when you relent to the pressure towards goodness that I *know* you feel, even if right now you resent and resist that pressure. Accept it as the *positive* kind of peer pressure. Extend your umbrella to the next little old lady shivering in the rain. You will be better for it, and the whole world will be, too.

I suggest you read that post. Because oh man, dude. If someone said to me in real life what you're saying to the internet anonymously... \n\nI guarantee you that if people know this side of you, they are already withholding from you all sorts of opportunities and recommendations they would otherwise provide you (and do provide to people they actually trust to act decently). You're the creepy selfish guy who can't be trusted to do the obvious right thing, and tries to rationalize his poor behaviour away with rigidly legalistic nonsense about what he 'technically owes' others, as if doing the bare minimum of what we 'technically owe' others (according to what, criminal/property law? As if that's all there is to human society?) is the difference between being an AH or not. Because AHs who withhold temporary-umbrella-sharing from little old ladies in the rain (and who claim it's on principle because the umbrella is 'their's', not explain that it's because they were paralyzed with anxiety and awkwardness or other mental health problems)... oh man actually, if you need this explained to you then I can't help. This is too basic. This is preschool. *It's nice to share,* bro. *No one cares that it's your umbrella,* bro. *That elderly woman is a vulnerable member of your community,* bro, and by failing to care for her in this easiest-possible way that most of us would feel *emotionally moved to do,* far from feeling reluctant to do, you are very clearly marking yourself out as someone who none of us can trust. You are the villain in the Disney movie. The snooty bad guy sniffing and jerking his umbrella away from the little old lady shivering in the rain. Can't you *see* the cartoon of yourself, vividly, in your mind? Even if you don't, most people in the real world do. \n\nI just cannot even. Maybe you won't see it, even if you think about it. And if that's the case... I only hope you tell people in real life exactly how you think, so we can all avoid you and not waste our time mistaking you for a decent member of society.", "[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6xoro/meta\\_this\\_sub\\_is\\_moving\\_towards\\_a\\_value\\_system/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6xoro/meta_this_sub_is_moving_towards_a_value_system/)\n\nPlease try not to learn your values from Reddit. It will not go over well in the real world. (And if you try to build yourself a bubble of only Reddit-similar friends in the real world... ugh, you're all going to spend your lives shivering cold in the rain.)", "Never said she did, or that he should give it to her entirely, for that matter. \n\nMy take is that he could and *should* share, because that is the kind, courteous, decent thing to do. And that he is within his rights but still the AH for refusing.", "Well since you're such a fan of context, perhaps you should go back and read my first comment, which said that *this sub* almost always defaults to the same logic you used. Not that you specifically make the same judgement in any situation, but that you are making a judgement *in this instance* that relies on the same (imo flawed) logic this sub often uses to justify unkind behavior. But I get it, it's very human to react defensively. Perhaps we can move past that reaction and have a conversation that *isn't* laced with petty jabs?\n\nMy concern here and reason for commenting is driven by my observations of a lack of compassion on a societal level, not a lack of random stories of compassion. It's quite saddening to see so many people agreeing that there's nothing at all wrong with someone refusing to help in such a simple situation. All the more so that it seems to be the default attitude of this sub.", "Being cold can suppress your immunity, as can anything that causes stress. If you\u2019re exposed to a virus and subject to environmental stress - e.g. emotional stress, strenuous exercise, or your body having to expend a lot of energy keeping your core temperature up because you got wet and cold - you have an increased risk of infection taking hold. If you\u2019re also elderly and therefore have a weaker immune system, and struggle more than someone younger to regulate your temperature, the risk is even higher.", "I\u2019ve never met someone who could do frequently miss the point and still sound so smug. In my initial response to you, I understood that you were talking about the sub at large, and I was making a comment on my own response - which you specifically chose to comment on - my feelings on it, and my thought process when it came to obligation. You then decided to take that, quote it heavily out of context, and twist it into a message that\u2019s the exact opposite of what I was saying to make some sort of \u2018point\u2019 that doesn\u2019t quite stick since it doesn\u2019t make sense given what you\u2019re quoting - or trying to quote.\n\nWe can also point out that my making that initial response to you has nothing to do with you quoting it out of context and twisting it to say something different then what I was very clearly saying, but you know", "And this is where we get into annoying territory, because I like being a little shit sometimes. Note that I never said you couldn\u2019t get sick due to the effects of being cold, but that I said the cold itself could not get you sick. Many people think that the cold itself is what gets you sick, as though somehow it carries germs. Hence \u2018common cold\u2019", "You know who I am? I\u2019m that guy that wears shorts in the middle of winter. And I\u2019m 49. And I hardly ever get sick.", "So apparently we cannot drop the jabs. It is Reddit after all.\n\nThis is clearly not going anywhere, so let's keep it civil per the sub rules and agree to disagree, shall we?", "Well, of course the cold itself can\u2019t make you ill. It\u2019s the effect it can have on your immune system that\u2019s the problem. Especially if you\u2019re vulnerable for other reasons, like being very young, or very old.", "Ahh you\u2019re the person I\u2019ve envied my whole life. I\u2019m the one who all my friends send memes to for \u201cthat friend who\u2019s always cold\u201d.", "I would hardly say that was a jab, but sure. But those in glass houses, eh? Commenters like you love to act innocent even though your own posts are far from above board. And of course, you keep ignoring the fact that you quoted me out of context because your smug ass doesn\u2019t like admitting that you might have fucked up\n\nAnd it\u2019s 3am where I am. I have no more patience today for smug redditors who try to make a point while misunderstanding a paragraph a 5th grader could parse out", "Yes I\u2026.that\u2019s what I said. That\u2019s exactly what I said", "Yes. I was agreeing with you."]}
