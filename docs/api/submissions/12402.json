I will say that you could have compromised and tried to share the umbrella, but depending on the size that probably wasn\u2019t possible", "NTA\n\nShe is free to ask. You are free to decline. This is a pretty low stakes learning moment for the lady who was sans coat and umbrella. It's a little water. Don't sweat it.", "NTA but you\u2019re not winning any prizes for charm either.  Next time just say no.", "Ehh NTA.  I understand that it\u2019s courtesy and polite to give your umbrella to the old lady, but it\u2019s your stuff and no one else is entitled to it.

It happened years ago and I still think about that guy here and there. I hope he's doing well.\n\nSo, are you an A-hole for not offering/sharing/giving your umbrella? I guess not, it's yours.

Maybe. Are you required to do it just because she was old and you are young? No. Does that make you an asshole? No.", "No one can make you be a decent human being though, can they?  Just hope you are never in need because Karma may bite you.", "How would you feel if that old lady was your mom or grandma. Think before you speak next time dumbass.", "Wow. YTA.", "YTA. Taking care of the elderly in your community will literally benefit every single person eventually. Not you, your karma will be different.", "Would there have been room for you to both stand under the umbrella and get some shelter? If so, YTA.", "NTA.

You're telling me ALL of you would just let an old lady standing in the pouring rain? What if that was your grandma and you found out someone just let her be vulnerable like that?

Just don't be mad when you come home to your castle and find yourself covered in fur and all your servants transformed into singing furniture.", "YTA - I mean sure you have the right to keep your umbrella\u2026 it doesn\u2019t mean your not an Ah though. You couldn\u2019t share it with the poor woman?

Unless you purchased something child sized, most umbrellas easily accomodate two humans when just standing next to eachother.", "It's your umbrella, but did you have to be such a dick?  It would not have hurt you to share your umbrella with the \"old woman\" out of simple decency.  There is so much hate and selfishness in the world today.  Can't you spread a wee bit of kindness?  Not doing so makes you a bit of a jerk, but your attitude, that makes YTA.", "NTA but hope you never need to ask anyone else for anything that they paid for with their own money.", "Your not an asshole technically I suppose but I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to know you.", "Yeah I'm gonna say YTA old lady is at a greater health risk, and you can get wet for 5 minutes.", "I'm in my 50's, so was brought up to be a gentleman,  to be a decent person  to have good manners.
