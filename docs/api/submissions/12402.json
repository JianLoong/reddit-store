Personally for me YTA and my reason is that you know yourself you were being shitty and it shows by the way you are trying to give excuses and blame the old lady for not being prepared. Sure you don't have to, but that doesn't make it the right thing.", "Ugh. Definitely YTA. If there was enough room under the umbrella for both of you and you had a raincoat, why not share? If there was only room for one person, but you still have a raincoat, why not let her use the umbrella until the bus arrives? You still have the raincoat. Or conversely you could've let her borrow the raincoat. \n\nI also don't get why OP didn't just ask the old woman \"hey, do you want to use my umbrella?\" since it was the other person who suggested letting her use it in the first place. Maybe the old lady was enjoying the rain and didn't mind getting soggy. Or maybe she was getting cold but didn't want to say anything because she felt awkward. \n\nIdk, I feel like this one is kind of obvious. You're not obligated to do anything kind, but ignoring people around you and deliberately being unkind is asshole territory.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou don't have to share, but why not decline politely. \"Sorry, I need it as I've got some walking ahead.\" \"Sorry, no, actually it's borrowed and I have to return it.\" \"Sorry, I can't help you.\"", "NTA but definitely no gentleman", "It\u2019s also important to be responsible for yourself and prepare.", "So? Oh no! whatever did we do before the apps?", "So did you", "OP called her an \"old woman\".\n\nWhat if she's more than a grown adult? What if she's... old? You know, elderly? Potentially beginning to experience cognitive decline? Confusion, memory loss?\n\nThis could straight up be someone's fragile grandmother at the beginning stages of Alzheimer's, who left the house for a long walk when it was warm and sunny (which the OP admits it was) and then later that day got trapped standing stationary at an uncovered bus stop in the \"pouring\" rain, miserable and confused and sad about how her day turned out. And then a young man (safely dry from *both* a raincoat *and* an umbrella large enough that he admits he could have fit them both under it) is asked to temporarily share his umbrella with her... *and he says 'No'.* And then this poor elderly lady has to just sit there at the bus stop next to this person who openly rejected her as unworthy of even a symbolic gesture of care, miserable and rejected and neglected by her community, unprotected under pouring rain despite protection being *right there,* just withheld....\n\nThis OP is totally the AH. I hope all of our grandmothers (and mothers as they age) meet better young people when they experience bad circumstances in public. My heart hurts thinking of my mom being rejected like this, if she needed someone to share their umbrella and they refused. I would disown a friend if I found out they did this. No one is worth knowing who would brazenly say they deliberately withhold umbrella-sharing from little old ladies caught in pouring rain, on the premise that they \"paid\" for their umbrella so they don't 'have to' share it. It's one thing if someone just has crippling mental health issues and reacts badly when asked, but *feels* badly about it later.

He admitted in another comment that his umbrella was large enough that he could have shared it and they both would have fit underneath, but he chose not to because he's a precious whiny baby about his \"personal space\".\n\n(Okay, he only chose the last two words. But all of it is true.)", "What I find amusing is the old lady did not ask. Some random third party asked on her behalf and she already now has a raincoat from that third party.", "Who said charity should be forced?\n\nThat's a different question from whether you're an AH for refusing to share your umbrella with a little old lady exposed under pouring rain at an uncovered bus stop.\n\nWhich OP is. An AH. \n\nI hope that's never your mom, aged and senile, suffering from dementia and confused about how quickly the weather changed from warm and sunny to pouring rain, then the emotional pain compounded by a younger community member going out of his way to refuse to temporarily share his umbrella despite being asked.", ">Is it nice?
