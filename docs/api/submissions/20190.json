Normally I wouldn\u2019t care, your hair your choice, but, my photographer was willing to take a variety of family photos throughout the day. Not just your typical wedding pictures. This was also the first time my sister had EVER dyed her hair. \nI called her after she posted some selfies on social media and asked if she was planning on keeping her hair that vibrant for the wedding. She told me it was none of my business and I would know in 2 weeks, on my wedding day. I let her know I didn\u2019t care if she planned on keeping it but my photographer would have to know before hand bc I would have to pay for extra photoshop in photos she was in. \nMy sister EXPLODED. \nShe told me it was not my place to change how she expresses her sexuality (apparently the colors she dyed her hair are the colors of a pride flag of some kind). I asked her what she meant by that, and she said she was finally ready to accept who she is and be open about her sexuality. I said I was proud of her but asked if she was planning on using her dyed hair to come out at my wedding? She said she wasn\u2019t going to say anything to our relatives, but if someone asked why she dyed her hair she would tell them the truth. \nI asked her not to use my wedding as an opportunity to come out to our relatives but she said it was easier for her since they would all be in one place. \nI begged her not to and she can tell people any other time. She agreed but said she would not be comfortable with me photoshopping her hair in family pictures bc she viewed it as limiting her self expression. \nNow this is where I might be the asshole. \nI told her I paid over $2000 (a lot for the area I got married) for the photographer and these would be our first family photos since our parents got divorced. And our ONLY family photos of us as adults.  These pictures will mean a lot to our parents and grandparents and I would not let her ruin them with her self done box dye job. (For more context, our family is VERY fair and her hair clashed HARD with the colors of the wedding.) I ended the conversation by telling her if she isn\u2019t comfortable being photoshopped then we wouldn\u2019t do extra family pictures in my wedding day and she wouldn\u2019t have to be worried about being on camera and I hung up. \nShe texted me a couple days later to tell me she actually forgot to ask off work and couldn\u2019t come to my wedding anyway (this was lie, she had actually planned a last minute, extended vacation with friends that overlapped my wedding day)\nSo AITA?\n\nEDIT: a few people have asked for some clarification. She dyed her hair a deep, Royal purple/blue and her natural color is a light blonde. When I offered to photoshop her hair it was at my own expense, not hers. I also offered to just lighten it to more or a pastel shade to be less eye catching. My main concern was the specific group family photos we planned to take, which my parents and grandparents were very excited to have in their homes. \nShe also was back to a blonde shade for her vacation and has not dyed it since.", "created_utc": 1687286760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ejewo/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_express_herself_at/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Generally I would think that you can't dictate someone's hair style for a wedding, but to make it into a giant billboard to come out is crossing the line. At least you didn't have to pay extra for photoshopping her out.", "NTA. Your sister chose the ONE day EVER that\u2019s about you and your spouse to try and make it about her. She is the AH.", "NTA. It's like people that try to do proposals at someone's reception, or show up to the wedding in a white dress. Somebody else paid for this event as a celebration of their wedding, no it is not okay to use it for your own agenda.", "Is coming out at weddings the new thing bc I keep hearing stories like this. I\u2019m bi so I did give my family a heads up, but I would never do that at some else\u2019s event and if I caught wind someone was trying that with me then they can stay home. \n\nLook I don\u2019t think you can decide what hair color someone has on your wedding. You can have an opinion, hell you can talk shit even but you can\u2019t really tell them to change it. That being said, I think your sister planning to come out at the wedding is tacky and real AH move.  NTA for me, hopefully you guys can work it out at some point.", "NTA\n\nYou have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to appearance and aesthetics on important occasions such as a wedding. Her intention by changing her hair was to get attention directed toward her. It sounds like it wasn\u2019t done tastefully, just rainbow flag colors to announce to your guests her orientation. \n\nIt was disrespectful toward you and the importance of the occasion. All she wanted to do was hijack your wedding.

Your sister is a massive AH", "INFO: at the risk of a dumb question, would the photoshopping have been to revert the sister's hair back to her natural color in the photos, or just extra work to make sure the photos would still look good, given OPs note about how the hair would clash with everyone?\n\nEdit: Typo fix 1", "NTA,\n\nI do think this got out of hand. But she decided to take your wedding day and make it about her. That\u2019s an ahole thing to do. At the end of the day it\u2019s your wedding and you have last say on what happens during it. It sucks that it ended the way it did. Honestly she could\u2019ve chosen another time.", "NTA\n\nSo, a few thoughts.\n\n* Weddings are celebrations for the people getting married, and *only* the people getting married, unless otherwise specified and approved by the bride & groom.\n* It's bad form for wedding guests to draw attention to themselves from the bride and groom (e.g., inappropriately white dresses/gowns, poor behavior, etc).\n* Box-dying your hair in bright, bold colors is fun!\n* Box-dying your hair in bright, bold colors two weeks before a wedding where you're an important and valued guest is kind of an asshole move, especially if you throw a tantrum about wedding picture photoshop edits. \n* Coming out is a ***big deal***, obviously (shouldn't be, but that's a whole 'nuther conversation).\n* If you're going to use a wedding as a coming out event:\n  1. Don't.\n  2. If you absolutely must, run it past the bride and groom first and get their approval.  \n\nI reckon that the sort of person who piggybacks their \"big news\" (engagement announcement, new baby announcement, divorce announcement, super amazing car loan interest rate announcement\\*) is also the sort of person who might actually burn you alive if you even thought about doing the same at *their* wedding.\n\n\\* - I mean, this one's probably okay, as long as you're not, y'know tapping a glass and \"Can I have everyone's attention, please?\" about it, cuz that'd be super weird.", "I'm a bit mixed. Where the 10% of me thinks you might be TA is just the expectation that every aspect of appearance at a wedding is a controllable factor, but I get your sister's desire to feel like she wants her appearance to be a reflection of who she feels she is, especially if she might be feeling like she denied herself for such a long time. She just picked one of the loudest parts of her looks to adjust, unfortunately. It also seems a tad much to ask for the photoshopping to be done - that part feels like an active denial of her identity.\n\nI lean more towards 90% you're NTA, mainly because your wedding is your day; it's reasonable for you to expect certain things look a certain way, especially as close as two weeks to the wedding. Sis could've picked a more subtle way of embracing who she is out of respect for you - but she picked nearly the loudest way possible, disregarding that the day was for you and your spouse. Your sister is definitely the AH for intentionally scheduling something when your wedding would happen, and then lying to you about it - especially when she's going to throw the idea of being more honest and comfortable with who she feels she is. Does she not think you're owed some honesty when she's demanding the opportunity to be \"honest\" with herself? Sister seems like she wants to scream and cry about getting to do what she wants but absolutely won't allow you to get what you want. On a day meant for you and your spouse.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is the equivalent of someone proposing at another person\u2019s wedding. You don\u2019t take the spotlight from someone else. Makes it even worse because she\u2019s your sister.\n\nAs for her \u201cdying her hair for her sexuality,\u201d \u2026 what? I know this has become a trend topic lately but it honestly doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. If you\u2019re queer it becomes like a character trait. I\u2019m straight and have never dyed my hair, celebrated it, or went out of my way to tell someone.\n\nAnd you aren\u2019t the a-hole for not wanting stupid hair in your family photos. Because that\u2019s exactly what unnaturally dyed hair is, stupid and looks bad (in my opinion of course). But you also can\u2019t dictate it. Just one of those things you have to let go, it\u2019s no one else\u2019s fault your sister will look dumb. Then again, if she did it for the sole reason of letting her family know she\u2019s queer or whatever, feel about that how you will. I could go into more detail on this if you gave the color(s), but you didn\u2019t so oh well.\n\nThen she won\u2019t come to your wedding.. truly petty and her actions speak loud to her character.\n\nOverall, you are NTA and your sister is the a-hole.

She\u2019s wrong for planning to come out at your wedding, as it\u2019s pretty clear she was going to do.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely ridiculous for thinking you get to dictate someone\u2019s hair for your wedding or photoshop it afterwards. If you\u2019re that worried about actual humans \u2018clashing\u2019 with your wedding colors, you\u2019ve taken several wrong turns towards BridezillaVille.", "My opinion on this is going to be unpopular and I already know it, but I'm of the camp that you don't get to control the people in your wedding or what they do with their body just because you are getting married. It's hair dye, it just doesn't feel that deep to me. \n\nAnother commenter said she's wrong for planning to come out at your wedding - that's not how I read it. It sounds like she's saying that if someone asks her why she dyed her hair that color, she would say because it's the pride flag and she's in the community. I don't really think that's the same thing as making your wedding about her coming out - it doesn't sound like she was planning on grabbing the mic and making an announcement or something, but correct me if that is what she did. \n\nI have a hard time understanding why her hair color would \"ruin\" your photos. I don't tend to look at things like that in family wedding photos - I look and say \"aw, look how nice it is that everyone was together and happy to be there.\" Truly, I think you're the only one who would really feel that way when looking back, and that's a shame for you because it tells me that you care more about aesthetics than the reality that everyone is there and able to get together.\n\nTotally uncool of her to skip your wedding entirely to go on vacation because of this. That feels petty and dumb, and it's a shame she missed a day she won't be able to get back.\n\nESH.", "yeah, kinda. The important thing should be that everyone is in there, the rainbow hair or whatever really isn't that big of a deal, and certainly doesn't ruin them. I don't understand why it was such a big deal", "\nE. S. Here\nHer more than you for trying to use your wedding to come out. I get finding your true self, but have respect for your sister.

Your wedding is not the place for big personal announcements and the pictures are yours to do with as you wish. You didn't ask her to change herself, you are making the pictures you want.", "ESH. She shouldn't view your wedding as an opportunity for her to come out to your family. That is your day, not hers, and she has no right to steal the spotlight. However, you cannot police the way her hair looks, and it is hurtful that you gave her an ultimatum of having her hair photoshopped or being removed from family pictures altogether. Hair can be a huge part of a person's identity, and refusing to let her be herself for your own aesthetic pleasure is a terrible way to treat your sibling. I know your wedding can be one of the most important days of your life, but is it worth this much heartache over some hair dye?", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have tried to use your wedding to come out. You for wanting to photoshop her hair so you could have your own fantasy family photos.", "Of course NTA\n\nWowsers", "NTA\n\nIt's just common curtesy to not dye your hair or make a huge outlandish change right before someone's wedding.

The fact that she didn't redo it before the vacation speaks volumes.", "No one ever harassed you or tried to kill you because you're straight though, right? That's why there's no straight pride.", "Because coming out as heterosexual has never required an act of courage. People are imprisoned or killed for being gay in some parts of the world.", "The bisexual flag is pink& purple& blue not just purple \ud83e\udd26\n\nNTA it sounds like she's trying to start shit and imo you'd be better off just letting her have her hair as she wants it as you may be playing into her desire to cause drama & get attention by ousting her from the wedding or by telling her to change it\n\nJust make sure she's not planning on wearing white to the wedding & don't play into her BS.... \n\nor you can ban her but that'llprobably be giving her what she wants & was possibly baiting you to do\n\nINFO: Does she have a history of this sort of behaviour?"]}
