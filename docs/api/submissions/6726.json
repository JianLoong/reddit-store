My parents are conservative and up until a few years ago, were completely against tattoos and non-ear piercings. I got my nose pierced at 20, after I'd had my job for almost a year. After getting it, and explaining that I liked it and that's all that matters, my mom loves it, and though it felt like pulling teeth, my dad accepted it. Both my sister and myself have visible tattoos, and my argument with my dad, who is an artist, was that we just wanted the art on ourself so we also can be art. I did the whole \"My body is a temple, and it's MINE to decorate/destroy.\" It was a matter of standing up for my feelings. Parents don't own their children's bodies. Why is that so hard to understand? So what if you don't like something? It's not on your body.
