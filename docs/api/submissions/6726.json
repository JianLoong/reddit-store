My parents are conservative and up until a few years ago, were completely against tattoos and non-ear piercings. I got my nose pierced at 20, after I'd had my job for almost a year. After getting it, and explaining that I liked it and that's all that matters, my mom loves it, and though it felt like pulling teeth, my dad accepted it. Both my sister and myself have visible tattoos, and my argument with my dad, who is an artist, was that we just wanted the art on ourself so we also can be art. I did the whole \"My body is a temple, and it's MINE to decorate/destroy.\" It was a matter of standing up for my feelings. Parents don't own their children's bodies. Why is that so hard to understand? So what if you don't like something? It's not on your body.

The only thing stronger than their bigotry is their need to objectify women.\n\nBut yes, I know a lot of bigots who are EXACTLY like that. They just get so offended by a woman who could not possibly be attracted to them because they're lesbians. As though it's not their garbage personalities that would scare any reasonable woman off.

I\u2019m not only very well employed, also highly recruited by other firms. His outdated opinions are not accurate (and I have 3 kids, 2 of whom have tattoos and are also highly successful).

He insulted her sister, his own daughter, and she defended her sister. John created the problem. \n\nYou've let your husband bully your children for years, and they finally have the power to make it stop. They don't have to sit there and take it because they're adults.
