We have a beautiful daughter, \"Amara\" (14f) who has decided to start wearing bindis in day-to-day life two months ago (Before anyone asks, no I didn't pressure her into this decision. This was all on her own and I don't even wear bindis daily). I helped her buy a bindi bag and Amara had carried it around with her whenever she'd be gone from home from more than a day ever since.\n\nLast weekend, I let Amara go to my SIL \"Bree\" (45f)'s house. Bree has two kids, \"Danielle\" (15f) and \"Chase\" (13m). Saturday afternoon, Amara called me crying and told me that Danielle and Chase had been teasing her about the \"dots\" on her forehead since Friday.\n\n\nThat morning, Danielle and Chase had grabbed the bag out of her room and dumped it into the pool as a \"prank\". It sank to the bottom, and since Amara can't swim, she wasn't able to grab it. \n\nAmara went to Bree and told her what happened, and Bree took Danielle and Chase's side, saying it was kids being kids and that they did Amara a favor with that prank.\n\nI comforted my daughter over the phone, and went to go pick her up soon after Amara said she didn't want to be at Bree's house anymore. \n\nOnce I got there, I helped Amara put her bag into the trunk before going to Bree to confirm the story. Bree confirmed it, and doubled down on what she said hard.  \n\nI was irritated at that and soon left with Amara. When we got home, I told Luke what happened and he suggested not having Amara go over to Bree's house until Bree apologizes for saying that the kids did Amara a favor by throwing her bindi bag into the pool, and the kids apologize for the incident itself.\n\n\nI agreed with that being a good idea, but checked to make sure Amara was okay with it first. Amara said that she doesn't even want to see her cousins or aunt now anyways, so I sent Bree a text explaining that Amara wouldn't be coming over under they all apologize.\n\n\nI didn't get a response at first, but when I did, Bree was telling me that was unfair and that I was punishing her and her kids over a dumb prank. I just replied that I just want an apology for my daughter and that should be a simple request.\n\n\nBree didn't reply back, but my MIL ended up calling me and telling me that I was horrible for not letting Bree see her niece and that both Amara and I needed to get over the incident when I explained Amara doesn't want to be around Bree or her kids either.\n\n\nLuke is on my side with this, but my MIL won't stop texting about how I need to just let this go and let bygones be bygones\n\nEdit: I ended up editing this since I accidentally used my husband's real name a few times due to getting angry while writing this post.", "created_utc": 1700214228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xbjas/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_to_go_over_to_my/", "score": 4706, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having to deal with this from your family is another level.  It should never have happened. \n\nAnd tell your MIL that since Bree cannot look after your child snd treat her respectfully, her comment about not letting Bree see her niece is ridiculous - this implies not only that Bree is owed visits, but also that she loves her so much and you are keeping them apart.  And that is absolutely not the case here.  There is no way that Bree can truly love Amara if she is rubber stamping racism against her niece.  This is a subtle gaslighting, but it is gaslighting.  Love is not about just feeling affection or blood ties - it\u2019s about respect, as well. Your daughter is not respected in that house.  Nor is she respected by your MIL. \n\nYou do have a problem, though.  You and your husband left it as an apology, but I don\u2019t think these people will even know where to begin with one.  I think you should leave this to him for now, but I genuinely think that he needs to have a serious talk with all of them (including MIL) about the implications of what they did/said.  Based on the conversations, nobody even seems to be acknowledging that this is anything more than a prank.  Do you really want your child to even be around your MIL who thinks it\u2019s OK that her white grand kids are racially bullying her mixed race grandchild? I don\u2019t know how accepting they have been of your ethnicity, but there are a lot of people who have the attitude that \u2018They\u2019re X, but they\u2019re just like one of us\u2019.   Meaning, rather than celebrating the differences, they are glossing over them and choosing to focus on the similarities, and specifically, how well you have minimized your culture in favor of theirs.  That\u2019s racism of a certain kind, as well, and given that your daughter was bullied for showing an affinity for her South Asian heritage, it seems to be at play here. So please consider whether an apology is enough, or is possibly just a starting point. \n\nNTA.", "I'll never understand how people can justify telling a \"victim\" to get over it, but then refuse to tell the offending party to get over it and apologize!?!?!", "NTA this would be a hill for me.

The gems are:\n\n* My kid can still drown, you told me you can't drown proof them!  I don't care if it would take \"extraordinary circumstances\" for them to drown after they learn to swim!  If they can still drown what's the point!\n* There's no money in swimming!  The only college scholarships are for football, soccer, baseball or basketball! (That doesn't change the fact that your football player son is in summer gym, and they come to the pool for some of their classes.  Your dumbass son, who knows he can't swim, volunteers to be a part of the team for the bellyflop contest.  If the guard currently on duty is easily intimidated because they are the same age that means *I* am one of the ones dealing with your panicking linebacker son in the diving well.  If I'm on duty, I'm public enemy number 1 because I'm older than all the high school kids and they can't intimidate me into letting him participate with threats of making my life hell at school because I'm in *university.*  They were shocked when I started cracking up laughing with those threats and informed them, I'd graduated high school two years ago).\n* We don't live near an open body of water; we don't need to know how to swim! (thinks about the large lakes and river in our area and shakes my damn head).\n* Lifeguards are RACIST.  There aren't any black lifeguards!  I only want my kids learning from a black lifeguard because you know a white lifeguard is just going to let my kid drown! (You are part of the problem.  If you don't teach your kids how to swim, don't encourage their swimming then they can't be a lifeguard because they have to know how to swim and swim well.   \nI'm going to ignore that last part you AH.).\n\nThese were what I heard firsthand twenty years ago.  Some of the guards that I mentor now, still hear them.  First, we have the uphill battle of changing people's attitudes towards swimming.

The cousins and aunt think, \"ha ha, this symbol of your culture is weird and dumb so you should just throw it away and be like us!,\" is a harmless way to think. And maybe if it just stopped there, it mostly would be.

It subverts the purpose of the more specific label, which is to describe a pattern or campaign of behavior.\n\nIndividual instances in an ongoing campaign of bullying are instances of abuse and manifestations of the ongoing bullying. But bullying refers to the pattern of behavior, rather than the specific incidents. These kids abused their cousin, on a xenophobic and/or racist basis. It remains to be seen if it becomes a pattern, becomes *bullying.*\n\nETA: In a very direct sense, calling it abuse is less severe because abuse can be incidental, one-off, but calling it bullying suggests a pattern of abusive behavior. It suggests multiple instances of abuse. So if anything, calling what is actually bullying \"abuse\" is more minimizing than the inverse. Calling what is actually an isolated instance of abusive behavior \"bullying\" is suggesting the problem is bigger than it necessarily is.", "There\u2019s the definition of bullying and then there\u2019s the connotation of what bullying means.
