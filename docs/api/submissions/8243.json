Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: When was Anna added to the group chat?", "NTA\n\nI'd suggest (as I've mentioned in other responses) **using a \"Catalish\" approach to the family group chat with your sister**. I'm a believer in playing with languages and mixing languages can help with everyone's comfort levels while still enabling communication. It'll also help ease Ian into communicating in Catalan as he can control how much he's using, for example: ***avui*** *I had* ***classe***, that kind of thing.\n\nI'd also suggest **looking into Facebook groups for Catalan learners**, many such groups organise virtual meetups and putting faces to languages helps learn them. It also might be easier for someone else to correct him! Mind, I think the cool kids are probably now on **Discord**.\n\nI'd also check to see if you can **watch your fav. series and movies dubbed into Catalan**. For example, this [article](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/actualidad/20220630/1001829708/son-primeras-peliculas-series-netflix-incluye-catalan-act-pau.html) (in Spanish, sorry!) says that season 1 of Emily in Paris has been dubbed into the language. (I'm only thinking of getting a VPN so I can watch Star Trek in other languages). This will help with getting his 'comprehensible input' and for **listening**, in general, and for learning some slang.\n\nFor **reading**, I tend to start with my fav. Agatha Christie books as I can remember who killed whom and why and so I can focus on the language itself. I've used her to start reading in Spansh and French, and now am doing so in Portuguese. AC may be a slightly old-fashioned vision of language, but other sources can provide more up-to-date language use!\n\nRemember that for adult learners, **a big issue is that adults frequently have to learn that it's OK to make mistakes** and that **making mistakes doesn't mean that they sound stupid**. I like to remind my students that learning to speak our native languages wasn't easy, we just don't remember our childhood frustrations (*why do we say \"I went\" and not I \"goed\"?*)\n\nAdditionally, there's an expression in Irish that I love: *Is fearr Gaeilge briste, n\u00e1 B\u00e9arla cliste* (Broken Irish is better than clever English) meaning that it's much better to speak \"badly\" in another language and make mistakes than only speak well in one language. (I do know that there are other issues involved with Irish, and that's only one of the interpretations of that expression!). Still, in Ian's case, it's much better for him to speak \"broken\" Catalan than only English. He'll appreciate your family and your culture a lot more.\n\nThis [link](https://www.movingtobarcelona.com/learn-catalan/) may offer some useful resources. Likewise, there's a Catalan [sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/catalan/) here too!\n\nFinally, I will say that **I've found it feels really odd to change languages with the same person**, so you may well find that your relationship with Ian might not *feel* the same as you get to know each other in another language. You might not feel comfortable correcting him, for example. This is why finding an outside group for him to practice with will be useful!\n\nBest wishes to you both. I hope his Catalan journey goes well.\n\n(Catalan is on my list of languages I want to learn!)", "Germans start learning English when latest they are 10 years old, likely earlier, having written conversations in English when you have time to look up stuff etc.\n\nNta\n\nAnd literally no problem to converse in a different language that way.", "Writing in both might help, I also made him a notebook with some phrases/vocab and will now and then tell him some words or useful things.\n\nShe never stated she doesn't like him or made any negative comments. On the contrary, several times she has said we make a great couple, we seem to be very stable and happy and that she is happy for me.\n\nIt caught me by surprise and I have honestly no idea where this comes from. They're also planning on moving to Germany this year so she'll have to speak a different language very soon (she knows German and has been studying it for some years)\n\nFurthermore, when talking with my mum about it she mentioned how quite often, when we meet in person or via videocall, they (sis and sil) will switch to German to talk to each other since no one else in the family speaks German", "Oh I wish I could do that, we have a somewhat strained relationship and pretty much anything I (or my parents) say she doesn't agree with she will get very defensive about and has sort of a 'I can do no wrong' attitude.\n\nI am quite low contact with her and generally just let things slide when she's being entitled or rude (for 2 years in a row we videocalled for my birthday and she didn't even say happy birthday or ask about my day) but I was not gonna let her be rude to my partner. She's my family and I chose to put up with her, he didn't get a choice as she is my family and he's dating me.", ">Ian is never going to learn to speak Catalan fluently enough to do anything other than make small talk when living in the UK or anywhere else that Catalan isn't spoken full time\n\nMany speakers of English who have learned the language in their home countries where other languages are spoken might disagree! I've had students who've done very well in their IELTS/TOFEL without ever leaving their home country.\n\nIf Ian can find online chat groups and watch and listen to Catalan media, he can learn quite a bit. Catalan may not have all the exposure that English has, but there are over 9 million speakers of the language, so there should be plenty to get him started prior to immersion.", "I don't really remember, but I'm quite sure it was when they were living together already so maybe a year and a half into the relationship? Ian was added when we visited, so about a year and 2 months into the relationship", "Could it just be that your sister is upset about moving to Germany and is trying to cling onto Catalan because she will miss her family and culture? She won't be hearing Catalan every day, and it won't be in the family chat.", "Honestly, I think you should use that newly gained borders you now have for your boyfriend and be kinder to yourself as well. You don't have to take it and she will have to be a bit less selfish to gain your company.\n\nFamily is something we are born into but we choose how to live with it or make a new non biological family", "Well, it sounds like she is TA then. \n\nI like SIL's idea to write in both languages. Maybe she can talk your sister into doing the same?\n\n Also, maybe it's time for a 'Coming to Jesus' (serious conversation) with sis. If she gets defensive easily, try and use \"I feel ..\" lingo to express how her actions affect you, while making the focus more on you than her. I only say that because I wouldn't want my partner to have to deal with that type of behavior. Not without at least trying to improve said behavior first. \n\nNTA", "Honestly, rather than totally change the language of the group, point out that you'd appreciate a Catalish approach!\n\nStudies show that mixing languages (translanguaging, to be technical!) can actually help learning as mostly people will replace like with like (ie, verbs with verbs, etc.) and there's some practice involved. \n\nSo mixing Catalan and English (and even German) could make your BF feel more comfortable, teach him some vocab (you can correct his pronunciation) and your sister can still chat in her language.", "Maybe, she has a groupchat with our parents and several friends she'll keep in touch with as well. She's been talking about moving to Germany for years, it was always their plan, but maybe it's becoming more real now. It feels weird thought because we don't really use it all that often, it's more just for big updates or random pictures of food we made or somewhere we went to.", "I kmow, I've never been the best at standing up for myself. I probably should, but I'm afraid I will do/say something to make her angry or cause a scene and my parents will be dragged into this and made to pick sides", "It was my sister's idea, but my SIL is doing the same.\n\nWe don't have much contact with her, but the tines I have tried to set some boundaries - like when I told her I use they/them in English - she made it all about herself and then she and SIL sort of teamed up against me. She was saying how she does not feel comfortable using they since it's a new thing, how she would rather use something else - if I said I felt uncomfortable being referred to with the wrong pronouns she sort of doubled down on her being uncomfortable. Eventually I stopped arguing but she has since started using they (mostly because everyone else does, including my parents even though their English is not the best)", "She sounds like a major PITA. I'd avoid her as well.  \n\nHer response to your preferred pronouns makes zero sense. What was her proffered replacement for they/them?\n\n(At this point, I'm wondering if she's just a self-centered  AH or an actual narcissist)", ">She was saying how **she does not feel comfortable using they since it's a new thing**, how she would rather use something else - if I said I felt uncomfortable being referred to with the wrong pronouns she sort of doubled down on her being uncomfortable.\n\nErm, *actually*... the use of a singular they in English has been documented since Chaucer and Shakespeare!", "I love your whole chatty multilingual family.

We'll definitely check all the resources you linked as well!

Quite a bit is not being fluent enough to follow a conversation and understand all subtext of a conversation. Ian isn't moving to Catalan it doesn't sound like...immersion is never going to happen.", "Literally, if someone can get a high enough score in either IELTS/TOFEL that means that they are qualified for undertaking university study in an English-speaking country. Many people do manage to do this without having left their home countries. \n\nLikewise, people manage to pass the Deutsches Sprachdiplom der Kultusministerkonferenz, the CELPE in Brazilian Portuguese, the Dipl\u00f4me approfondi de langue fran\u00e7aise, etc. without leaving their home countries. In many cases, **they need to prove a C1/C2 level before they can get the visa to undertake their studies**.\n\n**Getting to a C1/C2 level without immersion in the relevant language community isn't impossible**. Many manage to do it. But no one at an A1/A2 level could be described as fluent. Ian is, at the moment, at an A1 level.\n\n***Immersion*** (or learning in situ) is much more beneficial when people have a gist of the language before they arrive (how it works, what the verbs look like, how to ask where the toilet is, food vocab. etc.). *It's not necessarily defined as* ***moving*** *to the language community*, rather it is being exposed to it, being there. That could mean a three-week stay. \n\nI think we miss a lot of subtext in our own languages! When we're in another language community, of course, we'll miss subtext. For example, we may not quite get the jokes, but I've seen this happen with people who fluently speak the language of the place where they are, but who didn't grow up there.", "So in Catalan there are either neopronouns, which I prefer to not use, or just he or she. I'm AFAB but I prefer to use he/him when there is no neutral option (or qhen the neutral option is something I don't want to use).

They only speak their mother tongue. French, German, etc. would be their *additional* language.\n\nRegarding IELTS, you need to get a 6.5 to be allowed study in the UK (it's required by the university AND for the visa), so, if you can get it, you're supposed to have \"good enough\" English to survive the university experience. Of course, it's a starting point and better language skills will kick in.", "NTA.\n\nBut maybe El can write things in Catalan in Google Translate and then post the translation into the group chat?  Or even bf can do that - but just the opposite.\n\nPeople need to look for simple solutions and learn the art of compromise."]}
