Although, this is probably the last chance I'll give him and I am strictly putting my foot down.\n-Some asked what do I get from this relationship, he's not all that bad. There are some instances wherein he makes me feel happy too. Things just get overwhelmingly shitty at times.\n\nSo I talked to him, I made him choose if he wants to break up or change for the better. He chose the latter. I'm giving him one last chance to prove himself. Don't worry, I took notes of y'alls advices and insights. I won't let myself get stepped on anymore. I'm sorry if some you got pissed at my 'people pleasing attitude', I've been trying to get past that. I really do hope that the both of us get to deal with our own bullshits, for our future's sake. Thank you, everyone!!! I love you all!!!! I'll do my best to cherish my self-worth more.\n\n----- update end -----\n\nSo I (F21) and my BF (M22) have started living together for about a year now. We're renting an apartment which I am already paying for as well as the internet fees, which totals to around 250 USD. On the other hand, he's only spending around 90 USD on our other bills. These bills may seem low and cheap, but this is already high cost of living in our location. In comparison, I have been spending quite a lot, but he isn't financially well-off so I understand the comparison.\n\nAlthough these past few months, I have been shouldering quite a lot of his financial responsibilities too, mostly on our food costs. Aside from that, my share of household chores are quite a lot compared to his. Everything's been dragging me down lately since it's becoming heavy on me. I have tried communicating this to him quite a lot of times now, but all I receive are sorries and excuses. \n\nTwo days ago, our friends and us went out and they wanted to have dinner outside because it was already late that night. I agreed to eating out with them because I was tired and hungry. Aside from that, I wanted to come home and rest immediately rather than having to prepare and cook. On the other hand, I asked my BF if he wanted to eat with us. He refused and said he will just eat at home. I even told him I was sorry because I have no extra money to pay for his food that night.\n\nWhen we got home, he immediately told me to cook. I was shocked to hear that and told him he can cook if he wants to, but I can't cook for him because I already want to rest. He got mad at me and we've been giving each other the cold treatment ever since.\n\nPersonally, I find this fight really immature, but this kind of thing just keeps repeating and ends up with me saying sorry and going on with his ways because I don't want a fight anymore. Now I've been thinking that I don't want that any more. I'm done being his walking wallet and his personal nanny, and I want him to realize that.\n\nSo AITA for not cooking for him that night?", "created_utc": 1694590580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hgles/aita_for_not_cooking_for_my_boyfriend_when_he/", "score": 515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And he somehow has you wrapped around his finger to make you think that you breaking free from your full time bangmaid and sugar mommy role for a couple hours is something to be ashamed of. I urge you to reconsider this responsibilities split and seriously evaluate whether or not you'd be better off alone, with just your bills to pay and mess to clean and without worrying about a grown ass man tantrums.
