We're renting an apartment which I am already paying for as well as the internet fees, which totals to around 250 USD. On the other hand, he's only spending around 90 USD on our other bills. These bills may seem low and cheap, but this is already high cost of living in our location. In comparison, I have been spending quite a lot, but he isn't financially well-off so I understand the comparison.\n\nAlthough these past few months, I have been shouldering quite a lot of his financial responsibilities too, mostly on our food costs. Aside from that, my share of household chores are quite a lot compared to his. Everything's been dragging me down lately since it's becoming heavy on me. I have tried communicating this to him quite a lot of times now, but all I receive are sorries and excuses. \n\nTwo days ago, our friends and us went out and they wanted to have dinner outside because it was already late that night. I agreed to eating out with them because I was tired and hungry. Aside from that, I wanted to come home and rest immediately rather than having to prepare and cook. On the other hand, I asked my BF if he wanted to eat with us. He refused and said he will just eat at home. I even told him I was sorry because I have no extra money to pay for his food that night.\n\nWhen we got home, he immediately told me to cook. I was shocked to hear that and told him he can cook if he wants to, but I can't cook for him because I already want to rest. He got mad at me and we've been giving each other the cold treatment ever since.\n\nPersonally, I find this fight really immature, but this kind of thing just keeps repeating and ends up with me saying sorry and going on with his ways because I don't want a fight anymore. Now I've been thinking that I don't want that any more. I'm done being his walking wallet and his personal nanny, and I want him to realize that.\n\nSo AITA for not cooking for him that night?", "created_utc": 1694590580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hgles/aita_for_not_cooking_for_my_boyfriend_when_he/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A grown man stunting his health rather than learning how to cook something basic is pathetic. The fact that you feel somehow responsible for this is pathetic. What exactly does he bring to the table? You pay the majority of expenses, are shouldered with most chores, and it seems like he doesn't even provide emotional support because there's no way someone acting like this in this specific instance is a caring and supportive partner the rest of the time. And he somehow has you wrapped around his finger to make you think that you breaking free from your full time bangmaid and sugar mommy role for a couple hours is something to be ashamed of. I urge you to reconsider this responsibilities split and seriously evaluate whether or not you'd be better off alone, with just your bills to pay and mess to clean and without worrying about a grown ass man tantrums.

So at least keep in mind that this particular behavior won\u2019t be tolerable or sustainable for you to give in to 5 or 10 years from now. So if you are going to keep the relationship?
