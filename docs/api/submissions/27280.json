At that point, it's assumed that she expects traditional gender roles from you, but not the same in return, and got upset when you pointed that out. It also has nothing to do with income, it's about the gesture.\n\nIf it was only expected that you pay for her, then YTA.

Bad call. But, you could have apologized. Instead, you gave the worst analogy ever, one that makes you sound misogynistic. Doing more chores shouldn't impress any guy except those cringy alpha males. It was her birthday. You sound really cheap and not generous.", "ESH - what kind of friends and partner go out for someone\u2019s bday and let the guest of honor pay? You should have been (discretely) splitting it with the friends. How much everyone makes is irrelevant.", "ESH...I think your analogy is rather crass.  That said, I think it's ridiculous for her to expect you to pay for three extra people without discussing it beforehand.", "ESH\n\nYour gf invited her friends to for her bday meal ..... then expected you to pay for everyone??? What were her friends contributing? Why should it all fall on you? That's messed up, regardless of what you earn. You clearly don't know her friends very well, for you to need to make a good impression. She's an AH for that!!!\n\nYou now, you should have paid for you and your gf, as it was a meal you planned. You should be transferring the money for yours two meal back to her! AND, your finally comment about cleaning and whatever, I understand your frustration but completely childish and unnecessary!

But then, you *could* have offered to pay for at least her, it being her birthday and with you making 2-3x more. \n\nYou two need to sit down and make a deal about how birthday/anniversary/etc dinners are going to go.

It was her Birthday dinner ffs, not just a random outing.", "You're not the asshole for letting her pay the tab for everyone. I wouldn't have paid for her and all her friends. That said, I would have asked the waiter to split the bill and pay just for my meal and my girlfriend's. \n\nYou're definitely the asshole for the comments afterwards.", "YTA but also ESH? I'd honestly be so embarrassed if I went out to a birthday dinner with my friends & my boyfriend and I was the one who paid. Like, that would legitimately upset me lol. Also- I am so confused every time I read one of these stories?? Do people in relationships not communicate about how their finances work? Everyone has different finances & boundaries- it's so important to understand your dynamic with your partner. I make it very clear early on in relationships where I stand/ discuss how we take care of finances.   \n\n\nEither way, as one of the previous commenters said, this is more of an optics issue and I honestly agree. I think the friends are major assholes too. How do they not at LEAST pay their own checks- much less the birthday girls? But also you should've paid for yours & hers at the very least. The reason I say YTA is because that analogy is absolutely horseshit. No one should have to pay for their own birthday dinner and its not about gender roles either so your analogy makes no sense. I, as a female, would not allow my bf to pay for anything on his birthday. Your analogy sounds misogynistic at worst, and really just incomparable and dumb at best.  \n\n\nAlso, a lot of commenters think expecting you to pay for 5 people is UNREASONABLE. I kind of disagree. I think it truly depends on your expectations for a relationship/communication. I grew up in a traditional family where the men fight over who is grabbing the check/ get offended if you try to pay for dinner, so that's what's normal for me. However, if that's not what's normal for you too- that's fine. Once again, it goes back to communicating about finances and knowing your partner.", "Yes yta can\u2019t believe you made her pay for her own birthday dinner lmao bum", "Partially the ass\\*\\*\\*\\*, you should have paid for your girlfriend but not for the whole party she invited with her.

That was super nice of you. \n\nInviting you to dinner with her friends was her initiative and it\u2019s weird to expect you to pay for it. It\u2019s also weird to tell your SO what a good impression they would have made on their friends if they had paid. \n\nIf you\u2019re proud of your SO, you should be convinced they\u2019d make a good enough impression by simply being the way they are. \n\nI think your response was meant to make her think about what she was actually saying and she deserved that, regardless of the timing (bday).

Y\u2019all already celebrated her birthday and you got her an expensive gift. It\u2019s super weird that you were invited to go out with her and her friends and they expected you to treat everyone. It seems like they invited you JUST so you could pay for everyone.\n\nAlso your analogy was super bad lol so YTA for that but NTA for not paying which is what the main issue seems like. I understand you were trying to illustrate she wants me to pay to impress people I don\u2019t know so she should do _______ to impress people she doesn\u2019t know.

Of course NTA", "YTA for both.\n\nYou should have paid for the dinner. Making a good impression on her friends was the present she was looking for. Instead her friends think you are a cheapskate.  If you really couldn't afford to pay for her friends, then you should have made that clear to her friends (in advance, not in front of GF) and then paid only for her dinner and yours. OR you don't agree to have dinner with the friends--you let her go without you. You can be sure her friends would not have let her pay.  YES your GF was trying to \"show you off\" to her friends and you completely blew it.  It does not matter at all if you knew them well or not.  Now they think your are either very poor or very selfish.\n\nYour comparison was completely off-base.

If her friends don't make some noise about paying for themselves, they are also assholes, but way more critical not to be the AH to your GF on her birthday.\n2. When your GF brought it up, you got defensive and doubled down on your assholery. The analogy you made was misogynistic and dumb.

It's a two way street folks. \n\nYou also did a ton for her birthday, and I'm sure would've paid if the two of you had been out to eat.
