At that point, it's assumed that she expects traditional gender roles from you, but not the same in return, and got upset when you pointed that out. It also has nothing to do with income, it's about the gesture.\n\nIf it was only expected that you pay for her, then YTA.

Bad call. But, you could have apologized. Instead, you gave the worst analogy ever, one that makes you sound misogynistic. Doing more chores shouldn't impress any guy except those cringy alpha males. It was her birthday. You sound really cheap and not generous.", "ESH - what kind of friends and partner go out for someone\u2019s bday and let the guest of honor pay? You should have been (discretely) splitting it with the friends. How much everyone makes is irrelevant.", "ESH...I think your analogy is rather crass.  That said, I think it's ridiculous for her to expect you to pay for three extra people without discussing it beforehand.", "ESH\n\nYour gf invited her friends to for her bday meal ..... then expected you to pay for everyone??? What were her friends contributing? Why should it all fall on you? That's messed up, regardless of what you earn. You clearly don't know her friends very well, for you to need to make a good impression. She's an AH for that!!!\n\nYou now, you should have paid for you and your gf, as it was a meal you planned.

But then, you *could* have offered to pay for at least her, it being her birthday and with you making 2-3x more. \n\nYou two need to sit down and make a deal about how birthday/anniversary/etc dinners are going to go.

That said, I would have asked the waiter to split the bill and pay just for my meal and my girlfriend's. \n\nYou're definitely the asshole for the comments afterwards.", "YTA but also ESH? I'd honestly be so embarrassed if I went out to a birthday dinner with my friends & my boyfriend and I was the one who paid. Like, that would legitimately upset me lol. Also- I am so confused every time I read one of these stories?? Do people in relationships not communicate about how their finances work? Everyone has different finances & boundaries- it's so important to understand your dynamic with your partner. I make it very clear early on in relationships where I stand/ discuss how we take care of finances.   \n\n\nEither way, as one of the previous commenters said, this is more of an optics issue and I honestly agree. I think the friends are major assholes too. How do they not at LEAST pay their own checks- much less the birthday girls? But also you should've paid for yours & hers at the very least. The reason I say YTA is because that analogy is absolutely horseshit. No one should have to pay for their own birthday dinner and its not about gender roles either so your analogy makes no sense. I, as a female, would not allow my bf to pay for anything on his birthday. Your analogy sounds misogynistic at worst, and really just incomparable and dumb at best.  \n\n\nAlso, a lot of commenters think expecting you to pay for 5 people is UNREASONABLE. I kind of disagree. I think it truly depends on your expectations for a relationship/communication. I grew up in a traditional family where the men fight over who is grabbing the check/ get offended if you try to pay for dinner, so that's what's normal for me. However, if that's not what's normal for you too- that's fine. Once again, it goes back to communicating about finances and knowing your partner.", "Yes yta can\u2019t believe you made her pay for her own birthday dinner lmao bum", "Partially the ass\\*\\*\\*\\*, you should have paid for your girlfriend but not for the whole party she invited with her.

That was super nice of you. \n\nInviting you to dinner with her friends was her initiative and it\u2019s weird to expect you to pay for it. It\u2019s also weird to tell your SO what a good impression they would have made on their friends if they had paid. \n\nIf you\u2019re proud of your SO, you should be convinced they\u2019d make a good enough impression by simply being the way they are. \n\nI think your response was meant to make her think about what she was actually saying and she deserved that, regardless of the timing (bday).

Y\u2019all already celebrated her birthday and you got her an expensive gift. It\u2019s super weird that you were invited to go out with her and her friends and they expected you to treat everyone. It seems like they invited you JUST so you could pay for everyone.\n\nAlso your analogy was super bad lol so YTA for that but NTA for not paying which is what the main issue seems like. I understand you were trying to illustrate she wants me to pay to impress people I don\u2019t know so she should do _______ to impress people she doesn\u2019t know.

Of course NTA", "YTA for both.\n\nYou should have paid for the dinner. Making a good impression on her friends was the present she was looking for. Instead her friends think you are a cheapskate.  If you really couldn't afford to pay for her friends, then you should have made that clear to her friends (in advance, not in front of GF) and then paid only for her dinner and yours. OR you don't agree to have dinner with the friends--you let her go without you. You can be sure her friends would not have let her pay.  YES your GF was trying to \"show you off\" to her friends and you completely blew it.  It does not matter at all if you knew them well or not.  Now they think your are either very poor or very selfish.\n\nYour comparison was completely off-base.

Me and my partner trade off paying for dinner every time we go out, with birthdays being the exception.

If her friends don't make some noise about paying for themselves, they are also assholes, but way more critical not to be the AH to your GF on her birthday.\n2. When your GF brought it up, you got defensive and doubled down on your assholery. The analogy you made was misogynistic and dumb.

It's a two way street folks. \n\nYou also did a ton for her birthday, and I'm sure would've paid if the two of you had been out to eat.

Paying for your significant other/friend/family member for their birthday dinner is kinda standard unless there's some other extenuating circumstance (but given that OP made a point to say he makes so much more money, doesn't sound like he's broke or there are financial concerns at play). Literally has nothing to do with gender roles, would be the same if their genders were flipped. It's just the nice thing you do for someone's birthday when you go out and you care about them.", "You could have still paid enough to cover just you and her. But your analogy - not only it's a shitty analogy but it also makes you sound misogynistic. Good luck recovering from that.", "Then you grab the bill and say \u201cI\u2019m paying for girlfriend and me!\u201d", "Paying for her alone would have been enough to make a good impression but instead you turned it into some misogynistic power-play about her doing chores and cooking when your friends are over, when she said that it would\u2019ve been nice if you had paid for her birthday dinner, you\u2019re the asshole dude \n\nYTA", "Both of their retorts are distractions from the harder things to say.\n\nHer: I felt embarrassed tonight. I know you do a lot for me privately but i also want my friends to see you taking care of me because I\u2019m proud of our relationship and want them to share that positive feeling. \n\nHim: it makes me feel insecure that our relationship is more than you and me. It makes me feel vulnerable that other people might be watching and judging. And I feel uncomfortable that anyone would think I don\u2019t appreciate you.", ">After saying goodbyes to everyone when we were in car my gf said something really weird(out of her character) that I should have payed the bill in restaurant it would have made really good impression about me in front of her friends\n\nOp said she said he SHOULD have paid the bill", "Her issue is clearly the money, she said he SHOULD have paid but she was the one who invited HIM out with her friends!!!", "You're totally right. He did buy her an apple watch. \nBut paying for a birthday dinner instead of letting her pay for them both is just such a societal etiquette which he clearly lacks.  \nThe biggest reason he's an AH though is how he doubled down with that dumb analogy though. That alone made the whole situation worse.", "If he was concerned about who was paying for what, then he should have clarified that with the birthday girl before he \"happily accepted\" to go to dinner with these friends of hers.  And in advance can mean before they order if he doesn't know any of their numbers.\n\nSorry if I'm struggling how to do something I would never do.  If I was taking my GF to dinner on her birthday, I would pick up the check, period.  If I couldn't afford it because 3 friends showed up unannounced, I would ask the waiter to split the check. ANYTHING, frankly, but allow my GF to pick up the check.\n\nDid he happily accept assuming someone else--anyone else--would be buying HIS dinner?  Did he really think it would be OK to allow the birthday girl to buy not only her own dinner, but his as well?  Never mind 3 others?\n\nNo logical person would believe that the person earning 1/3 would offer to buy dinner on their own birthday.   Actually I find it highly unusual that the waiter would hand the bill to GF, who would obviously be the \"guest of honor\" at this dinner.", "She DIDN\u2019T ask him to pay. She said she wished he had paid because it would\u2019ve looked good to her friends.\n\nShe\u2019d like her friends to think that she\u2019s with the kind of guy who picks up the check on his gf\u2019s bday \u2014 someone who operates with a fundamental spirit of generosity. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t about the money.

Be like a duck and let it roll off your back.", "Pointing out the double standard in gender roles would be, \"Hey, assuming that the man is supposed to pay for things is a gendered double standard, and I don't think we should be engaging in it.\"\n\nWhat OP did was say that she should do performative women's work to make his friends see he got a good one. That's AH behavior, and makes it an ESH.", "Why didn't you pay for the both of you? Just cause it's her birthday. Why would you let her pay for you too?", "Read it again, he said he had dinner planned but not for this particular outing with her friends", "No, he did not plan a birthday dinner.\n\nHe planned and did a small celebration at midnight with a cake, flowers and a gift.\n\nThe girlfriend of the GF asked to join them for the dinner and he agreed.\n\nWhat I do not understand is why the 3 friends did not chip in and pay for the birthday girl.\n\nWhy did the friends expect the birthday girl to buy dinner for everyone?\n\nAlso very sexist to expect the man to pay for all the women.\n\nI could understand OP paying for his GF and himself and he should have but not the others.", "Her friends might have seen that hundreds of dollar watch too which he bought for her but yeah let's forget about that and call that guy cheapskate", "They're also cheapskate. Why is he solely responsible for the meal? What about them... why do they deserve a free meal?", "But doesn't her analogy makes her seems like gold digger or leecher.

She doesn\u2019t expect him to pay. She knows he doesn\u2019t pay more than his share. She wanted him to appear to be better than he is in front of her friends. This wasn\u2019t a money complaint. It was an optics complaint. A character complaint.", "I agree he should have paid for himself and her but it sounds like the full bill was given to her by the waiter..... so for him to take the bill and ask the waiter to split it, so he wasn't paying for the friends..... that's seems so awkward. \n\nI definitely don't agree with the analogy, however, I understand he's reasoning for doing so. He stated in a comment somewhere that he only said it to basically show her that gender role she's putting on him is stupid. She wants him to match his gender role by paying for the women but she got upset when he mentioned stereotypical female roles. He claims he'd never expect that of her but wanted her to see how her trying to put him in a gender box to impress her friends is stupid, as is him putting her in a gender box to impress his friends.", "If it would have been me in the situation, the only thing I would have assumed to be paying for would be mine and my partners. Especially if it was my partner's birthday. Not for one second would I consider paying for the two extras without being asked to prior to the meal. It doesn't matter who makes the most money, if I invite someone out for dinner I'm paying for it. I don't care if they make more than me. That shouldn't even be a factor.", "He already showed a fundamental spirit of generosity when bought her apple watch(check the prices) and still wishing on him to pay for dinner. Man I feel bad for your partner like even after spending hundreds of dollars gf is still not satisfied aka leecher.", "I took it as more of a response to point out the double standard, but I guess I would have to hear the tone to know for sure. I don\u2019t think he literally wanted her to do more chores around his friends. In context I think my interpretation is more likely.", "Rather than expect him to pay the bill to impress them, she should have just flashed her wrist \ud83d\ude02", "No, it doesn't. You're her boyfriend, you make more than double. And you are sitting there nit picking \"ohh I already did this for you, so I'm not gonna do that for you\".  \nYour relationship sounds transactional.", "No it doesn\u2019t. He invited HER out for a birthday dinner. The assumption is obviously that is part of her gift.", "The fact that she was visibly upset because he didn't pay the bill, implies she EXPECTED him to pay the bill. She invited him out with her friends, with the expectation that her and ALL her friends were getting a free meal!!! That's wrong to expect that. Hoping is very different to expecting! And she expected it! Or she wouldn't have said you SHOULD have paid. Had she said 'o I wish you had paid, my friends would have found that so sweet' maybe a different story but she said he should have paid to make a good impression!!! \n\nIf she knows exactly what he's like (as you've stated) why the heck did she invite him? And are we missing the fact that NONE of her friends put their hands in their pockets? But yet she's only upset with him", "You keep saying wishes... 'wishes' and 'should have' are both very different. Wishes implies there was a hope, should have implies there was an expectation! \n\nAre you serious? He bought her a bloody apple watch!!! Those things aren't cheap but as well as paying for the watch, he must (after being invited to HER get together with her friends) pay for her meal and 3 other people (he doesn't even know them). \n\nYes, he should have paid for her meal but why is there an expectation to pay for the friends.", "It\u2019s not about the money. She didn\u2019t say that he hadn\u2019t spent enough or that she expected him to pick up the check.\n\nShe essentially said that she wanted her friends to think that she was with the kind of guy who picks up the check on his gf\u2019s bday.", "I, female, saw it the same way as you did.", "You think in context the guy who told his gf to do more women's work in front of his friends in order to impress them did it in a reasonable tone to show a double standard is more likely than him being an AH? Whatever you say.", "Yeah, no... Id say whoever invites pays and you agree with it before going out. Her comment was unecessary, Id say ESH because both statements are very AH-ish", "You actually sound like a leecher/gold digger like even after spending hundreds of dollars you still expect him to pay wow.", "No she invited him out with her friends lol. Go back and read it.", "I don\u2019t agree. She didn\u2019t flip out. She said that she wished he\u2019d pretended to be generous in front of her friends. He\u2019s just not that kind of guy.", "I believe that the spirit of her comment was that it would be great if he\u2019d shown off to her friends. I do not think her comment indicates that she expected him to pay or that he was obligated to pay.\n\nShe would like to be with the kind of guy who picks up the tab on his gf\u2019s bday.  That\u2019s it! \n\n(There are some unknowns here. One is whether, when the waiter gave her the bill, the bill was already split. We don\u2019t know if she picked up the tab for the whole table or just for the two of them. I do think it would be weird for her friends to allow her to pick up their tab.)", "It doesn\u2019t make him an AH though for not automatically offering to pay for 3 people who are not his friends (he did state 3 friends in the post but 2 in a comment). Your comment goes on about comparing her waiting on his friends is not the same, but it literally is. You\u2019re putting him in a gender stereotype \u2018it\u2019s polite for you to pay you should automatically offer who raised you\u2019 like what! Who raised you to offer to pay for dinner for 3 people out of the blue, clearly have money to burn. I would never expect that of my partner, not without a conversation first. \n\nHe could have offered to give her money for his own and her food if money was the issue but why should he have to pay for everybody and why does it make him an AH for not jumping to buy dinner for everyone? Entitlement much\n\nEdit: in fact I\u2019d call the friends more of an AH than him. What kinda friend sits there and let\u2019s the bday girl pay for them, my friends split the bill and pay for the bday girl", "Yeah, given the context here that is more likely. He was comparing doing household chores and him paying an expensive dinner bill for her and her friends. Both are traditionally gendered actions that for years have been expected by society. Seems like a great way to expose the absurdity of her request.", "Look, I make almost 150k. My husband makes the same. When we were dating, he paid for my birthday dinners and I paid for his birthday dinners.  \nYou asked for judgement and I gave you my judgement. You didn't like it so you went for a personal attack. You're an AH all around and I hope she leaves you.", "You keep saying wished.... why? She said SHOULD! as stated before those two words have different meanings! \n\nYou're right, she may not have flipped out but she went in to a huff because her expectations were not met. If she knows the type of guy he is (your words, not mine), why did she invite him??? Using your logic, sounds like shes setting him up to fail?", "Then honestly, she should have communicated that a bit better. I think if how op described the event is accurate (highly doubtful, usually are on here) then her thoughts and feelings were not conveyed properly. \n\nI agree he should picked up the tab, had he invited all of them out but in this instance, he's just a tag along (no offence op). He was invited out on a girls night. So to invite someone out on your get together and then wish (I'm going to use your wording) they would pay for the whole group, that's not cool. \n\nYou're right, there are many unknowns but from how op worded it, I'm getting the impression the whole bill was handed to the gf and she paid (maybe that's because I'm from the UK, we don't get handed split bills, not I've ever seen anyway). If she paid for him and her, he's defo the AH. However, if she paid for the whole table..... well my initial comment still stands.", "I\u2019m female. I pick up the tab for the whole table on occasions. I do it automatically. To me, that\u2019s just good manners.\n\nHe didn\u2019t HAVE to. He wasn\u2019t OBLIGATED to. \n\nHis gross assholery, though is equating generosity and subservience. \n\nGenerosity isn\u2019t a uniquely male trait.", "FYI, you're not talking to OP anymore, that's a different commenter that jumped in there", "He didn\u2019t say she was huffy or mad. He even said her comment was out of character. This was about optics to her. She thinks he SHOULD pretend to be generous when other people are looking. Or, she wishes he pretended. Or she just wishes her friends didn\u2019t know he\u2019s not generous.", "Really, though, he\u2019s the AH for telling her that she should impress his friends with subservience.", "I\u2019m female too! Well done for you for having enough money to be able to do that, not everyone can. And just because it\u2019s stated OP earns more again does not mean he should pay for other people. Again this is why you have a conversation about it before hand", "Yeah I realized that afterward lol\nJust another loser though who thinks paying for someone's dinner means they're golddiggers. Probably under 25 and working a low wage job thinking everyone is after the money he doesn't have", "Why do you assume he's not generous? Because he didn't pay for this one thing for ALL her friends, that SHE invited HIM to? \nHad he got her some garden picked flowers, a bottle of evian and some Aldi branded chocolate, then went on to not pay for her bday meal..... I'd back your corner..... he bought her an apple watch! Again, they're not cheap! So she got a really expensive gift and then stated 'he should have paid for the whole groups meal, to make him look good in their eyes'? \n\nMaybe if her friends don't think he's generous, she should flash her wrist at them!!!", "O 100%, stupid move on his part but in the same breathe, why should something so trivial impress his friends, the same way she wants something trivial to impress hers. \n\nI don't agree with either statement from both sides! And for that, they're both AH in my eyes. Neither should have to do anything (potentially out of character) to impress each others friends.", "He\u2019s an asshole for equating generosity and subservience.", "No but multiple gifts AND the dinner? No matter who makes what, unless its established beforehand, pay your part and bring it up later. Have a discussion.", "Asking someone to pay for their dinner after getting expensive gift is exactly gold digger behaviour but ofcourse you are women you don't see anything wrong with that lol", "Have you ever been anywhere when someone who absolutely didn\u2019t have to picked up the check?\n\nIt is generous. It\u2019s well-mannered. It leaves everyone with a good feeling. It\u2019s just\u2026a good thing to do. That\u2019s it."]}
