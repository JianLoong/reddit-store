I clearly pushed the door to keep it closed (it didn't even open enough to have a crack open it was still in the door frame) Granted I did it a little hard because of the force he uses to open said door, the reason I didn't go the \"I'm in here\" route is because it never works with any of my family they always open the door regardless of how many times I say it and then close it right after so I found that way works best. Next thing I know my dad's upset because I could've broke his foot (I didn't even hurt him) my mom starts yelling like always about how Im such a dick to everyone and she is sick of how I keep treating people and she's sick of me slamming things /sure I intentionally avoided my little cousin but that's because she's loud and 4. Even though I never really leave my room and when I do I normally don't talk to anyone except dinner or to my brother. Of course I raised my voice to ask why the fuck they don't knock she didn't take that well she goes that's not an excuse to be slamming things.

Also, as for how you responded, your parents shouldn't yell at someone yet expect you not to yell or get angry back, that's just unfair. \n\nYour parents sound rough to say the least, but something tells me you're not old enough to get away yet. I'd definitely recommend opening up to someone close to you that you trust and feel comfortable with: a teacher, friend, other family members, hopefully they can help you out a bit.", "NTA - you deserve privacy, especially in the bathroom. I know you said they\u2019re not trying to invade your privacy, but it seems like they honestly just don\u2019t care. \n\nI\u2019d do two things in your shoes. The first is to ask them if they\u2019re trying to see you naked and how they\u2019d feel if someone barged in on them naked. The second is to get a door stop. The rubber ones are pretty cheap and can be jammed under a closed door to at least stop them if they aren\u2019t actually trying to see you naked.", "Maybe you should rephrase your title from \"slamming the door\", which usually implies it was open, to \"pushing the bathroom door to keep it closed.\"\n\nAlso, your family should move the hamper (dirty laundry bin) outside in the hall. The dog will get bored of knocking it over after a few times - lol (if that's the reason it's in the bathroom). We had the bottom (floor level) shelf of a hall closet that we used for a hamper.", "NTA, but your family has boundary issues.  It's not right to just walk into a room with a closed door without knocking.  It's called common courtesy.  They are completely disrespecting your privacy.  I started knocking on my kids doors when they turned 13.  Show respect to your kids & you will be respected back.", "NTA, a rule in the house is me and my younger sister can not under any circumstances lock our bedroom doors, and we aren\u2019t allowed to slam out doors either (they will remove our doors) but that being said if either door is closed they will always knock even if my door is cracked open they will knock. And really no lock on a bathroom what if there is guests?", "NTA. If it takes Dad's broken foot for the family to learn a modicum of courtesy (knocking before entering bedrooms and especially bathrooms) that normal people extend to perfect strangers, not to mention family members, then so be it.\n\nDad's are typically leaders in families so he should lead by example first and stop this disrespectful and unruly policy that seems to have taken root in your household. He should also insist that everyone else stop it too. Soon, maybe your mother (who was just abusing you to ally with your father instead of suggesting the new, safer, more effective policy rather than the \"no-nock warrantless\" intrusion policy) will follow suit, and then your siblings, and who knows, maybe even the dog - lol.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents are treating your house like a house instead of home (if that makes sense). You absolutely have a right to be upset. If you haven't already, I'd try sit them down and have a serious conversation about how you feel and how your not being listened too (assuming your safe and comfortable go do so). \n\n(Im talking out of my ass here and this is all my opinions, but yeah take care)", "NTA. They don't respect you and they don't value your privacy. We have two kids, a teen and a young adult. In our house we rarely lock doors but we always knock and wait for a response before entering. That way no one gets embarrassed. You might want to keep a door wedge nearby.", "NTA.\n\nMy parents always respected  our privacy and never barged in on us (even when we were downstairs bonging in my brother's room. I had the bong and my back to the door as he opened it so I hid it even though he could probably smell it. We (my 3 older siblings and I) were pretty sure my parents knew we were smoking pot, but this  way he had \"plausible deniability\").\n\nYour parents might be concerned your are using narcotics (pot, crystal, pills, etc ...) and maybe that's why they have the barge in policy. You should really get those interior door locks fixed. We had the twist doorknob type which could be opened from the outside with a nail through a little hole. They're not meant to be secure, but  they are a reminder to knock before entering and delay entry so the occupant deserves privacy, regardless of their age. Next time anyone barges in on you, tell them: \"Your late. I already masturbated today. If you really want to watch so bad, we can make an appointment for tomorrow.\" It just might shame them enough to cease and desist - lol.", "Make a busy/occupied on one side and Free on the other and place it on the door. NTA", ">they say it's their house and they can do what they want\n\nThere's a difference between house rules like \"take off your shoes when you come in from outside\" or \"everyone eats together for meals\" and not respecting the privacy of your child. It's not difficult to knock on a door and wait for the answer. Also, putting laundry in the basket is not an emergency."]}
