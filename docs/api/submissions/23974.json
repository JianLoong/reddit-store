We have a great relationship and get along really well and I could really see myself spending the rest of my life with him. There is only one problem\u2026 his mom (I will call her Mary throughout this story). \n\nAfter almost a year of our relationship I really wanted to meet mary and  my boyfriends dad but he kept pushing it off. Eventually he decided to set some things up so we could all go out to eat. When I first met his dad he was nice but I kinda got the feeling Mary didn\u2019t like me. \n\nEventually as I started to get to know them more Mary started making really rude comments to me about what I was eating. She would say things like \u201care you really going to eat all of that?\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t you think you should watch your figure a little bit, my son doesn\u2019t like fat girls\u201d etc. I would laugh it off as a joke but my boyfriend and his dad never said anything. This happened every time we would eat with them and I started to lose my patients. This went on for months. \n\nEverything came to a boiling point at tonight\u2019s dinner we had. She started with her usual comments but something about this one comment made me lose it. \u201cI didn\u2019t cook a lot of food today so please try to restrain yourself. I know it\u2019s hard for your kind\u201d. She made me feel like some kind of child and I lost it. I slammed my fork on the table and stood up and yelled \u201cMaybe you should consider restraining yourself. Last time I checked this is the second plate you\u2019ve gotten fat bitch?\u201d Mary and my boyfriends dad was shocked. Mary started crying and I immediately felt bad. Before I could even say anything my boyfriend grabbed my hand and took me to the car and we went home. It was silent on the way home and I asked if he wanted to talk and he said \u201clet\u2019s just talk about it tomorrow\u201d he then went to bed but I can\u2019t help but feel bad. \n\nI need to know if I was out of line. So Reddit am I the asshole for calling my boyfriends mom fat while at dinner?\n\nEdit: A few people have been asking what she meant by \u201cyour kind\u201d. I don\u2019t want to jump to any conclusions because I don\u2019t know for sure what she meant but I assumed it\u2019s because I\u2019m black and the percentage of obesity is high In the black community.", "created_utc": 1691287516, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jdh2b/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_mom_fat_at_dinner/", "score": 6154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems like something else is going on here.", "NTA. OP, your boyfriend's mother is not only fat-shamer, but a total racist. Yes, obesity is a problem throughout the US, and her behavior towards you is obnoxious, disrespectful and disgusting. She got what she deserves. Also OP, you need to reevaluate your relationship with your boyfriend, because until you told his mother off, not once did he ever defend you. I don't think your relationship will last.", "A lot of people are saying E S H. I could understand that\u2026if not for the \u2018your kind\u2019 comment of his mother\u2019s. Girl, she\u2019s a fat fucking racist. She\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t get called something worse. \n\nThe fact that your boyfriend hasn\u2019t stood up for you and then allowed his disgusting racist mother to make racist comments to your face\u2014I\u2019m so sorry, I hate the classic \u2018leave his ass\u2019 jumps people make on Reddit, but if he can\u2019t see what his mother is doing and won\u2019t stand up for you, leave him. One of the nastiest types of racism is **ambivalence**. Your boyfriend seems ultra ambivalent. He knew she was racist when he tried to keep you from meeting her. So he knows his mother is a racist and he expects you to put up with it, because\u2014and I\u2019m so sorry\u2014he doesn\u2019t think you deserve respect. \n\nAnd you do deserve respect. Not just because of the color of your skin but for the individual that you are. You deserve a man who will tell his asshole mother that she is a racist and to shut the fuck up. \n\nHe will never stand up to her. He has no spine and does not deserve you in any reality. Please talk to him and help him face facts, and if he can\u2019t, then leave his pathetic ass. You don\u2019t deserve this treatment. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She shouldn't dish out what she can't stomach herself. What's really amazing is how her rude and abrasive behaviour was ever countenanced in the first place. Don't feel bad,OP. Every woman has a boiling point.", "NTA bc she had it coming. If she apologizes to you then I\u2019d also apologize to her, if she doesn\u2019t tell your boyfriend he can go to dinner there alone from now on.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend\u2019s mother has been body shaming you for months while your boyfriend and his father have done nothing. When it finally boiled over in your incident in question, they continued to do nothing while your boyfriend gave you the silent treatment for the rest of the day. You should question what position you will be in your boyfriend\u2019s life, is his mother more important or are you more important to him.", "NTA, the fact that full grown adults think it's okay to talk to younger generations like this is sickening. Though I probably wouldn't have thrown \"b***h\" in there - I would've either been just as subtle with my comeback (ie - don't you think it's inhospitable to place portion restrictions on guests when you're already on your second plate?) Or I would've been blunt about my boundaries (ie - I don't appreciate being talked to like that and I won't tolerate veiled insults anymore. I'd like to get along for your son's sake but I can be just as vicious if you continue).\n\nETA - OH SO SHE'S RACIST TOO. Alright I'm officially rescinding the second part, calling her a b***h was well deserved.", "NTA. Sure, what you said was mean and may end the relationship, but this woman has been egging you on with her behavior for a long time because she dislikes, disrespects, and is jealous of you. Sometimes people with a bad attitude and character like to pick away at others and then act the victim when the person they've been abusing loses their cool and acts out. By you losing your cool, you fall into a potential manipulation whereby they get to position themselves as a victim even though she's been consistently horrible to you.\n\nI get the sense Mary acts the victim when she's been aggressive or passive-aggressive, and if she has been this way with her family and they have been cowed by her behavior for 20+ years she ain't going to change now.\n\nYou're young and it may be time to move on.\n\nIn the future, using assertive positive communication earlier as suggested by some other posters is a good idea. If you do this it means identifying the extent of the problem and the other party's maturity level sooner and avoiding potentially being an asshole by yelling insults.", "ESH.  Calling bf mom a fat bitch \u2026 yeah, sorry, that\u2019s an AH move even if it\u2019s true. Saying it out loud to her face is a deal killer, but who cares.

I feel you could have gotten your point across without them. I say good on you for standing up for yourself. \n\nMy guess is that she is jealous of you. Maybe this will be a good time for yall to get to know one another. If you really see your relationship moving past this, it is worth sitting down and telling her how you feel. You aren't a child. Neither is she. Good luck OP.", "ESH, though almost YNTA. \n\nWhat the actual hell? Her behavior is shockingly unacceptable. If my mother treated anyone, let alone a partner that way, she would never hear from me again and good luck for her when she gets old and sick. \n\nThat being said, while I can empathize with your response, you also going low is not great. It's not great from a decency perspective, plus it never ends up working. And I say this as someone who has a temper and *has* snapped back in similar situations.", "Eh I chuckled.\n\nI think calling her a fat bitch was a case of you not setting boundaries earlier. You should have said something milder sooner. Although rude I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole so I guess NTA but just barely.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to set boundaries.", "ESH\n\nI mean, you were not **wrong** to respond rudely to her, but I don't approve of your choice of language, *especially* when it comes to working in a gendered insult.\n\n> \"I didn\u2019t cook a lot of food today so please try to restrain yourself.\"\n\n\"Sure, I'd be *happy* to demonstrate to your family what restraint looks like, for once. I suppose they have to learn somewhere!\"", "YTA for how you handle conflict. You don't wait for it to build then explode. You address it calmly the first time it happens...Things like \"Your comments make me uncomfortable\" or \"Can we please not talk about this, I find it inappropriate\". Shut her down every time she mentions it and firmly set boundaries. \"I won't be able to join you for dinner if the conversation will be about XX\". Let her know that you won't tolerate her behavior from the get go. To often we just suck it up until it reaches the boiling point...not a good strategy.", "NTA.

I am going to presume not for the below. \n\nI get it, and it sounds like from your edit she's racist.\n\nShouting at her in the way you did was not the best way to handle it. Although I bet it felt good in the instant. \n\nIt clear boiled up and over, understandably, but maybe discussing with your boyfriend when it first happened you could have prevented it getting this far. Either by breaking up with him sooner, of becuase he stood up to his mum. But also he should know it's wrong and should have done it without you saying anything. \n\nHe's an ass for not doing it himself. You're not in the wrong for being upset or annoyed. His mum is an absolute AH.\n\nIt's hard to judge becuase you really went in, but omg did she deserve it.\n\nI'm going with NTA because it sounds like she's racist and your boyfriend hasn't stood up to her. You shouldn't have to talk to him to get him to know what's right.", "NTA. OP, you realize this woman is racist right? It\u2019s really concerning that your boyfriend didn\u2019t say anything in your defense when his mother was bullying you multiple times. \n\nYou were pushed to the breaking point, I don\u2019t think you were wrong to respond with explicit language to her disgusting behavior and comments.\n\nEdit: she had no problem calling you fat and dehumanize you with \u201cyour kind\u201d, but was crying when you said something in kind back to her? Nah\u2026", "NTA. But the bigger problem here is your bf, not his mum. Why are you tolerating a man who allows his mother to speak to you like this? Girl, show yourself some respect and leave that man.", "ESH but justified I think. I mean you should have put a stop to this months ago with your bf. Why would he let his mom talk about you like this out loud? Why would you stay with someone who wouldn\u2019t stand up for you? \n\nI think calling her names was like a sucky thing to do (bc calling people names is sucky) but I understand how your fuse was short after ~months~ of this sort of treatment.", "ESH. And here is why. You were talked down to but you ramped that up to 1000% by responding the way you did.

Take your own feelings seriously. If someone repeatedly insults you, stand up for yourself in a civil way before the situation snowballs. In this situation, you could have told your boyfriend early on that you felt humiliated by his mother's behavior, and asked him to talk to her about it. You could have let him know that you weren't going to tolerate being insulted any more, so the next time it happened, you were going to get up and leave.\n\nThis would have been more dignified than losing control of your anger and making a scene, which Mary then used to make herself look like the innocent victim.

She also said she realized after meeting these guys that her ex was low key like that too. Like this girl was so excited about me just because I wasn\u2019t a huge woman hater. I actually felt so bad for her because the bar was so low. I told her I have a business actually that revolves around supporting and pushing women athletes and she almost cried when she heard that because I was the opposite of all the douches she met. \n\nIt\u2019s funny because my gf said she was shocked when we talked about ex\u2019s I spoke so highly and kindly of all mine. I took responsibility for the ones I screwed up and that I was really lucky to have met so many great girls, even if it didn\u2019t workout. Which is true.

I very much genuinely believe the stuff I say about women, the support I give and know truly how much bullshit they deal with. It has been very easy to date and find women who are interested because I can understand and empathize with women\n \nSo many of these guys who complain about not getting women could easily get the attention of women if they made half the effort to learn and discuss the women\u2019s side of life. \n\nMy gf and my ex both said they fell for me so quickly because how aware and easy to talk to.

Which made them more comfortable than ever because they knew they were safe and I understood what they experienced. \n\nMy point is. These Andrew Tate fans could easily get girls if they could just see women as individual fucking humans but it\u2019s too hard for them. I\u2019ve heard some literally say that all women want is rich men and girls all have an easier life and just want too party. And I was like you can\u2019t surely believe that every single person wants that and so many actually do. Like there are so many women all around them who are nothing like that.

Do you seriously think these guys would be okay all of a sudden with their daughter dating a black guy? \n\nYou should feel anger and empathy about how we face abuse and then on top of that have to worry about how we respond. That\u2019s what should upset you, not the poor racist person. \n\nYou thought you made a good point. It took this man 30 years to get less than 200 people to be a little bit less racist. Think about the thousands he talked to and still decided to be racist despite being confronted by a kind, smart hardworking man. Thousands of people heard him talk and said nah, black people are still scum and we need them eradicated. KKK literally wants me and my family dead or out of the country and you think I\u2019m a bad person because I wouldn\u2019t talk to them or care about if they get hurt or not?\n\nWhere do white people like this seriously get the courage to tell black people how to respond to kkk and nazis? You\u2019ve literally never experienced it and yet here you are defending racist and calling me a terrible human. I AM BAD BECAUSE I SAID I DONT CARE IF RACIST GET HURT. \n\nYou have no idea what it\u2019s like to deal with racist people and how terrible and haunting it can be. My first lasting childhood memory is a mom and daughter called me n-word and spitting on my face. Do you know how fucked that is? But you want me to go pluck a flower and give it to them so hopefully they don\u2019t spit on someone again? \n\n\n time trying to convince racist people not to be racist? You don\u2019t have to worry about racism as a white person, so why don\u2019t you spend your time talking to racist people to change their mind. Y\u2019all are so comfortable telling black peoples what to do and how they have to do it. If you think it\u2019s what people should do then you do it. \n\nAnd your comment saying I\u2019m finding excuses to hit people or whatever smug comment that was.  I love how you people change around what I say to sound like I\u2019m some crazy violent guy. Lol. Yeah man, I\u2019m such a psycho because my roommates racist friend who called me the n word in my own home and other racist and I stood up for myself and told him exactly what would happen if he racially abused me. The utter disrespect and dehumanization of racism absolutely justifies my reaction. See how you tried to minimize the racism and maximize the violence. You frame it that I\u2019m looking for it when I clearly told you I was the one being harassed with racism. \n\nThis shit doesn\u2019t work. I see right through your effort to make me out to be a violent thug. If you don\u2019t racially harass someone you would never have to worry about violence. But something tells me you don\u2019t care about the racism, you just hate the part where there\u2019s consequences for being a horrible person. Every incident I\u2019ve dealt with like that has been constant name calling and harassment. \n\nI get it. Racist are scared how there are so many more consequences for their behaviour. People fighting back, losing their jobs and their friends. It\u2019s never been worse to be a racist and that scares and upsets you because you are racist. Byeee", "Nothing at all, I'm just happy and wanted to share. Apologies to u/blacknatureman if it came across as dismissive or tone-deaf.", "It didn\u2019t. Lol. I\u2019m happy for you. I\u2019m just giving you shit, lol. It\u2019s cute and I\u2019m happy you are so happy for her. Usually I break the tension of discussing serious race issues with jokes. My gf\u2019s dad was an incredibly kind person and good guy and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re also very kind and a good human. Don\u2019t let us making a little fun of you prevent you from being proud of your sister and family for treating someone well and like family. We need more people like that.\n\nYou should be excited for your sisters cute babies. It\u2019s like Will Ferrell says \u201cinterracial kids are Gods photoshop\u201d they will be adorable", "My mom also makes homophobic comments. I call that out when she says it and I happen to hear it. Thank goodness she doesn't do it on social media and she does listen to reason somewhat. But yeah, we need to tell our parents off sometimes.", "Exactly. My moms my best friend and incredibly kind and open minded woman. She made sure I knew homophobia was bad since I was a little kid. But she\u2019s older and not that media literate and she kept getting so much hateful anti trans shit. She didn\u2019t say anything terrible but she repeated some clearly untrue things about trans people. She kept trying to engage me in it even though I didn\u2019t want to discuss it. Finally, I told her extremely clearly that you\u2019re trying to engage me in a topic I don\u2019t want to speak about with incorrect facts, you\u2019re bordering on being inappropriate. I can clarify what you\u2019re misunderstanding but I will not tolerate any negativity or spreading of misinformation. This also isnt a topic to discuss often, it\u2019s unnecessary. She knows and trust me, so she\u2019s no longer falling down that rabbit hole the way so many fucking Americans are. I Don\u2019t even blame my mom the YouTube algorithm is so deplorable.", "Yup! OP edited to add that she is black.", "It helps that her dad taught her how to punch. She used those skills a few times in middle & high school when boys were inappropriately touching her. She is also a Gemini.", "True, they want people to read MLK but only certain things. I Have a Dream speech and things like that.", "Totally agree. OP wins by getting out of a relationship where no one truly respects her. If the BF learns anything about how to respect people, then he wins as well. Otherwise, he was never going to learn anyway.\n\nThere is no excuse at all for how the mother treats OP and there is also no excuse at all for EITHER of the other two for not stepping in to correct that behavior. Seems as though racism is pervasive in the family even if it's only to fully tolerate it by the part of the BF and father.", "Your boyfriend and his dad are fucking just as useless as that fat batch, I'd never let my family say that shit to my girlfriend.

So Mom is probably racist.", "Accurate. People on this sub are major doormats. Like person trashes your ass, well dont kick them out cuz they have nowhere to go. Major doormats.", "Sorry, I didn't express myself very well. I completely agree with you. If a family member is being a nightmare, then going NC is probably a healthy way to go.\n\nMy point was meant to be that SHE had to make that decision, not her BF. As difficult as it is... it is her mother.  You are completely right \"toxic is toxic.\"", "The problem is that you can react two way;\nCivility and passivity, or violence. Racists want the violence because it's what they expect, they know how to handle violence. What they can't handle is kindness because it ruins their perception of superiority.", "This isn\u2019t true at all. Lmao. Stop it. Just stop. Stop fucking trying to convince being kind is the key. You have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019ve laid out in my other comments spending years doing that and it never changed a thing. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just between yelling or kindness. It\u2019s 2023. There\u2019s calling out and assessing racism. Letting everyone know what they said and how they feel. Challenge them to say it aloud. Tell their bosses and coworkers what they said. Confront them and stand up for yourself. I\u2019ve called out tons of people and ripped them a new one. \n\nAlso, do you think the racism and interactions happen between people I can just spend time with or that they\u2019ll even listen. \n\nThe last two times I got called a n word it was by drunk guys at the bar. What should I have walked over there and bought them a beer. Do you think if I turn my cheek and walk away and that guy has no consequences he\u2019s just going to change his mind about racism. \n\nThese comments make it so clear in regards to who has no idea what that experience actually is and how it happens. Stop trying to make black people still fight for equality. \n\nSame people who tell us to react to racism with kindness also say white privilege doesn\u2019t exist. Not a single one of them has ever worried about how their actions reflect their race, not a single one of you has experienced constantly going over to someone\u2019s house to face racial insults and belittling and felt obligated to keep going to change the mind of racist. \n\nWe are tired. I\u2019m 30 I\u2019ve been done justifying my existence. I have enough friends, family job security where I don\u2019t give a fuck personally what racist people think and I\u2019m not going to be kind to them. I\u2019m going to make it very clear how I feel and if they continue to be racist, that is on them. Seems like the perfect example of fuck around and find out. So sick of wearing kiddy gloves with white Redditors who are so entitled they think they can tell us how to behave. Why don\u2019t y\u2019all spend your free time explaining to racist why they shouldn\u2019t be racist then? Huh how often you do that? Is there any topic in the world where y\u2019all keep your opinions to yourself?", "I'm wondering if the weight comments the mom made in the past were really just to hide the racism she has against OP", "I agree.

And I have seen enough egregious incidents just in my city to know that the \u201ca few bad apples line\u201d is disingenuous.\n\nMy point is that dismissing police issues is ignoring institutionalized racism, a concept that I simply didn\u2019t realize was as pervasive as it is until I really, really looked at it.\n\nI agree with you that OP faced blatant racism, and tacit support of it by bf and his dad.", "Okay, maybe I just misunderstood you because  a few of other commenters here are arguing with me about being patient and kind with outright racist, which is totally unfair to ask. To subject them to repeated racial harassment in the hopes they may become a little less racist. Its a common aspect of experiencing racism that a lot of people don\u2019t realize. \n\nI thought you were comparing yourself and saying you changed your min, so can they. But dealing with deeply racist people is so much different than having discussion with an open minded person that\u2019s already illustrated they can adjust their beliefs. \n\nI like coming into reddit and having civil discussions and sharing experiences and information with other and id listen to you the same way if you spoke about being a woman. \n\nBut I don\u2019t have the energy or mental health as I get older to deal with stubborn illogical and mean racist people. They steal your happiness, chip away pride and securities. Their words cut deep and they take little pieces of you. My strongest child hood memory from elementary school is being racial attached and spat on by racist mom and daughter when I was like 10. Can you imagine your kids strongest memory from before they were a teen is being called the n-word and trying to work through that alone as a child\u2019. These are the type of people some commenters are telling me I owe them a conversation and to respect them. They want black people to set themselves on fire to keep the racist warm and I\u2019m not doing that anymore \n\nSorry for the misunderstanding as I\u2019m assuming now you weren\u2019t inferring the same thing^ as them. \n\nI\u2019m very thankful for people like you who can pivot their opinion. But that\u2019s because you\u2019re pivoting from a reasonable position. People who are deeply racist are not coming from reason, so to reason with them would be pointless usually", "I know it's a nitpick but she did not go lower.  calling someone a fat beotch,  in response to straight racism,  is not going lower.", "\"A riot is the language of the unheard\""]}
