We have a great relationship and get along really well and I could really see myself spending the rest of my life with him. There is only one problem\u2026 his mom (I will call her Mary throughout this story). \n\nAfter almost a year of our relationship I really wanted to meet mary and  my boyfriends dad but he kept pushing it off. Eventually he decided to set some things up so we could all go out to eat. When I first met his dad he was nice but I kinda got the feeling Mary didn\u2019t like me. \n\nEventually as I started to get to know them more Mary started making really rude comments to me about what I was eating. She would say things like \u201care you really going to eat all of that?\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t you think you should watch your figure a little bit, my son doesn\u2019t like fat girls\u201d etc. I would laugh it off as a joke but my boyfriend and his dad never said anything. This happened every time we would eat with them and I started to lose my patients. This went on for months. \n\nEverything came to a boiling point at tonight\u2019s dinner we had. She started with her usual comments but something about this one comment made me lose it. \u201cI didn\u2019t cook a lot of food today so please try to restrain yourself. I know it\u2019s hard for your kind\u201d. She made me feel like some kind of child and I lost it. I slammed my fork on the table and stood up and yelled \u201cMaybe you should consider restraining yourself. Last time I checked this is the second plate you\u2019ve gotten fat bitch?\u201d Mary and my boyfriends dad was shocked. Mary started crying and I immediately felt bad. Before I could even say anything my boyfriend grabbed my hand and took me to the car and we went home. It was silent on the way home and I asked if he wanted to talk and he said \u201clet\u2019s just talk about it tomorrow\u201d he then went to bed but I can\u2019t help but feel bad. \n\nI need to know if I was out of line. So Reddit am I the asshole for calling my boyfriends mom fat while at dinner?\n\nEdit: A few people have been asking what she meant by \u201cyour kind\u201d. I don\u2019t want to jump to any conclusions because I don\u2019t know for sure what she meant but I assumed it\u2019s because I\u2019m black and the percentage of obesity is high In the black community.", "created_utc": 1691287516, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jdh2b/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_mom_fat_at_dinner/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, obesity is a problem throughout the US, and her behavior towards you is obnoxious, disrespectful and disgusting. She got what she deserves. Also OP, you need to reevaluate your relationship with your boyfriend, because until you told his mother off, not once did he ever defend you. I don't think your relationship will last.", "A lot of people are saying E S H. I could understand that\u2026if not for the \u2018your kind\u2019 comment of his mother\u2019s. Girl, she\u2019s a fat fucking racist. She\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t get called something worse. \n\nThe fact that your boyfriend hasn\u2019t stood up for you and then allowed his disgusting racist mother to make racist comments to your face\u2014I\u2019m so sorry, I hate the classic \u2018leave his ass\u2019 jumps people make on Reddit, but if he can\u2019t see what his mother is doing and won\u2019t stand up for you, leave him. One of the nastiest types of racism is **ambivalence**. Your boyfriend seems ultra ambivalent. He knew she was racist when he tried to keep you from meeting her. So he knows his mother is a racist and he expects you to put up with it, because\u2014and I\u2019m so sorry\u2014he doesn\u2019t think you deserve respect. \n\nAnd you do deserve respect. Not just because of the color of your skin but for the individual that you are. You deserve a man who will tell his asshole mother that she is a racist and to shut the fuck up. \n\nHe will never stand up to her. He has no spine and does not deserve you in any reality. Please talk to him and help him face facts, and if he can\u2019t, then leave his pathetic ass. You don\u2019t deserve this treatment. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She shouldn't dish out what she can't stomach herself. What's really amazing is how her rude and abrasive behaviour was ever countenanced in the first place. Don't feel bad,OP. Every woman has a boiling point.", "NTA bc she had it coming. If she apologizes to you then I\u2019d also apologize to her, if she doesn\u2019t tell your boyfriend he can go to dinner there alone from now on.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend\u2019s mother has been body shaming you for months while your boyfriend and his father have done nothing. When it finally boiled over in your incident in question, they continued to do nothing while your boyfriend gave you the silent treatment for the rest of the day. You should question what position you will be in your boyfriend\u2019s life, is his mother more important or are you more important to him.", "NTA, the fact that full grown adults think it's okay to talk to younger generations like this is sickening. Though I probably wouldn't have thrown \"b***h\" in there - I would've either been just as subtle with my comeback (ie - don't you think it's inhospitable to place portion restrictions on guests when you're already on your second plate?) Or I would've been blunt about my boundaries (ie - I don't appreciate being talked to like that and I won't tolerate veiled insults anymore. I'd like to get along for your son's sake but I can be just as vicious if you continue).", "NTA. Sure, what you said was mean and may end the relationship, but this woman has been egging you on with her behavior for a long time because she dislikes, disrespects, and is jealous of you. Sometimes people with a bad attitude and character like to pick away at others and then act the victim when the person they've been abusing loses their cool and acts out. By you losing your cool, you fall into a potential manipulation whereby they get to position themselves as a victim even though she's been consistently horrible to you.\n\nI get the sense Mary acts the victim when she's been aggressive or passive-aggressive, and if she has been this way with her family and they have been cowed by her behavior for 20+ years she ain't going to change now.\n\nYou're young and it may be time to move on.\n\nIn the future, using assertive positive communication earlier as suggested by some other posters is a good idea. If you do this it means identifying the extent of the problem and the other party's maturity level sooner and avoiding potentially being an asshole by yelling insults.", "ESH.  Calling bf mom a fat bitch \u2026 yeah, sorry, that\u2019s an AH move even if it\u2019s true. Saying it out loud to her face is a deal killer, but who cares.

I feel you could have gotten your point across without them. I say good on you for standing up for yourself. \n\nMy guess is that she is jealous of you. Maybe this will be a good time for yall to get to know one another. If you really see your relationship moving past this, it is worth sitting down and telling her how you feel. You aren't a child. Neither is she. Good luck OP.", "ESH, though almost YNTA. \n\nWhat the actual hell? Her behavior is shockingly unacceptable. If my mother treated anyone, let alone a partner that way, she would never hear from me again and good luck for her when she gets old and sick. \n\nThat being said, while I can empathize with your response, you also going low is not great. It's not great from a decency perspective, plus it never ends up working. And I say this as someone who has a temper and *has* snapped back in similar situations.", "Eh I chuckled.\n\nI think calling her a fat bitch was a case of you not setting boundaries earlier. You should have said something milder sooner.

I suppose they have to learn somewhere!\"", "YTA for how you handle conflict. You don't wait for it to build then explode. You address it calmly the first time it happens...Things like \"Your comments make me uncomfortable\" or \"Can we please not talk about this, I find it inappropriate\". Shut her down every time she mentions it and firmly set boundaries. \"I won't be able to join you for dinner if the conversation will be about XX\". Let her know that you won't tolerate her behavior from the get go. To often we just suck it up until it reaches the boiling point...not a good strategy.", "NTA.

I am going to presume not for the below. \n\nI get it, and it sounds like from your edit she's racist.\n\nShouting at her in the way you did was not the best way to handle it. Although I bet it felt good in the instant. \n\nIt clear boiled up and over, understandably, but maybe discussing with your boyfriend when it first happened you could have prevented it getting this far. Either by breaking up with him sooner, of becuase he stood up to his mum. But also he should know it's wrong and should have done it without you saying anything. \n\nHe's an ass for not doing it himself. You're not in the wrong for being upset or annoyed. His mum is an absolute AH.\n\nIt's hard to judge becuase you really went in, but omg did she deserve it.\n\nI'm going with NTA because it sounds like she's racist and your boyfriend hasn't stood up to her. You shouldn't have to talk to him to get him to know what's right.", "NTA. OP, you realize this woman is racist right? It\u2019s really concerning that your boyfriend didn\u2019t say anything in your defense when his mother was bullying you multiple times. \n\nYou were pushed to the breaking point, I don\u2019t think you were wrong to respond with explicit language to her disgusting behavior and comments.\n\nEdit: she had no problem calling you fat and dehumanize you with \u201cyour kind\u201d, but was crying when you said something in kind back to her? Nah\u2026", "NTA. But the bigger problem here is your bf, not his mum. Why are you tolerating a man who allows his mother to speak to you like this? Girl, show yourself some respect and leave that man.", "ESH but justified I think. I mean you should have put a stop to this months ago with your bf. Why would he let his mom talk about you like this out loud? Why would you stay with someone who wouldn\u2019t stand up for you? \n\nI think calling her names was like a sucky thing to do (bc calling people names is sucky) but I understand how your fuse was short after ~months~ of this sort of treatment.", "ESH. And here is why. You were talked down to but you ramped that up to 1000% by responding the way you did. Talking to people like that is NEVER ok\n\nEDIT: After telling my hubby what happened he said my mum makes comments like mary when she eats around us towards me and thats why i have an ED im constantly struggling with.
