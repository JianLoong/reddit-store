It helped so much to be validated so thank you all again.\n\nA lot has happened since I made my first post so I\u2019ll try to condense it as much as I can.\n\nAfter reading your comments and realising I actually do have a reason to want to spend a date alone with my girlfriend I decided to try to talk to her when she got home and also explain a few things to her that I did not realise myself until reading your comments, sometimes it\u2019s hard to get your point across properly through text so it\u2019s always best to speak face to face. \n\nWhen my girlfriend came home later that day I tried to talk to her but she blew up and nothing really was solved so I tried again the next day and it went pretty much the same way, she was denying she had done anything wrong and telling me I was the one in the wrong. Eventually I just told her that I couldn\u2019t do this anymore or be with someone who thinks that what she did was ok, I think this sent her into a panic because she became even more verbally aggressive to the point I just left the convo and didn\u2019t talk to her. We barely spoke for a few days while I tried to figure out what to do until she came to me and asked to talk. She explained that she had thought about what I said to her when she came home and understood why I was upset. I then found out that her sister had been feeding her a lot of hate about me and explained that because of her mental health condition she can be very easily manipulated into a certain viewpoint, which I honestly do see. She apologised and I did tell her how hurt I was by everything and it will take a long time to get over this to which she said she understood. Some of you suggested placing boundaries in the relationship, I brought this up in the conversation, suggested a few boundaries and she has agreed to and respects this which I was quite shocked to hear.\n\nSince that day things have been ok between us and we have been taking things slow, she has also come to the realisation that the relationship she has with her sister is extremely toxic and how manipulative she is. A fight happened between them a few days ago, I don\u2019t really have the space to go into detail but it really put into perspective how narcissistic and manipulative she is.\n\nMy girlfriend has since again apologised to me for everything and I have accepted her apology. I can see how she was being manipulated by her sister. I\u2019m not sure what will happen moving forward but just wanted to give an update as people have been asking and to let you guys know that things between my girlfriend and I have now been sorted.\n\nThank you all again for your comments on my first post, it really did help with resolving this situation! I just hope that my girlfriend doesn\u2019t get sucked back into her sister\u2019s way of thinking again. We will just have to wait and see!", "created_utc": 1693703808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168jo95/update_aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_want_to/", "score": 777, "replies": ["Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ve2da/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_want_to_spend/)", "I'm a bit concerned... if she is so easily manipulated what's to stop her from being manipulated by a coworker, boss, or another family member?

I\u2019m a sucker for a happy ending, and you sound so thoughtful & sweet, so I\u2019m really happy things are working out. \n\nGotta say though, her default of \u201cverbally aggressive\u201d is worrying. I hope she\u2019s aware that how she acts isn\u2019t ok\u2014it sounds disrespectful af :/ Maybe the phrasing just makes it sound worse than it is?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to have those convos, especially with people we love. You deserve to be treated with dignity, love & kindness. Arguments can be had without using words to hurt others. I hope she grows with you, and reflects on her behaviour.", "Hmmm.  This relationship does not sound healthy. You\u2019re NTA.", "Glad you set boundaries and she opened up about the problem. Hopefully things work out and she gets therapy as well.", "The update is certainly promising and hopeful.  Moving very slowly is very smart, hard to get past how originally she flat out said that niece and sister get 100 preference in any activity, but seems to be moving forward in right direction.\n\nIf I may though\u2026 this is a gf.

It shouldn\u2019t be this hard\u2026", "I read this post and thought maybe this is one of those rare occasions with a happy ending\u2026 but then I read the original post and I no longer think this is actually a happy ending.\n\nYour gf has done a massive 180 because you didn\u2019t talk to her for a few days, not because she\u2019s had an epiphany about her behaviour, this just feels like self preservation kicking in.\n\nI hope it\u2019s not the case but your gf is very likely going to change her stance again in the future. If she\u2019s still talking to her sister and is this malleable then it\u2019s going to come around again.

You are someone who is quick to forgive and empathetic enough to feel with a person even when they're being monstrous.\n\nYou need to get out. Even if she says she's working on it, even if you clearly communicate your boundaries. She'll never be able to respect them. She'll never not be manipulative or narcissistic in her behavior, unless she goes to therapy and seriously works on herself for years. Most people are not capable of that, and even if she were, you do not want to be part of this journey. No matter how much you love her. She is going to go nuts and hurt you again and again, until you have no strength left and leaving becomes insanely hard. The dopamine Hits are hard to resist.\n\nFor the love of your soul. Get out.", "** oops sorry, missed genders\u2026 \nI can see you mean well, but sometimes we need to take on the hard stuff for the people we love.

Just because someone has a mental health condition, doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t deserving of someone to love them and help them grow.

OP, I\u2019m glad you figured out the sister was manipulating the situation, but it worries me that your GF\u2019s default setting when confronted on anything is to verbally abuse you.

Didn't her sister agree with you in the last story?\n\nNo offense but this sounds like your girlfriend is feeding you a line of bullshit. Sounds like you're the one being gaslit here.

Hope you two can built an happy and stronger relationship.\nIf you can, therapy would be amazing for her and for both of you", "So... I'm glad for this update. But I'm concerned, too... Like - look at how all the problems you had are now her sister's fault, actually. Your very valid concerns have all been externalized. It's not her fault, it's her sister's way of thinking that's to blame. That's a depressingly common tactic - \"It's not *my* fault, it's trauma from my mother, it's because my ex cheated on me, it's that new coworker bringing me down,\" anything to avoid taking responsibility, facing consequences, having to change. I'm not saying that's for sure what's going on, nor am I saying it's intentional behavior on her part if it is, I just think you should be careful - because she was the one treating you badly, not her sister. Whatever thoughts or feelings did or didn't come from her sister *initially*, at the end of the day she was the one who wasn't treating you with the grace and the respect that you deserve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI *really* recommend reading Lundy Bancroft's \"Why Does He Do That\" if you haven't - can't remember if it came up last time, but it's very relevant here despite the kinda heteronormative title.", "screams BPD.", "Jfc not everyone and everything is narcissism.
