{"id": 13537, "submission_id": "1269aja", "title": "AITA for evicting my tenant who is a single mother of 3?", "selftext": "I posted a eviction notice on my tenants door today. For background, my tenant is a early 30s female, who signed a lease with me almost 2 years ago. At the time, she was listed as the only occupant apart from her dog, a medium sized pit-bull, who I approved. In the last six months, I have learned that she also lives there with her three children. They are with her one week on one week off. The condo I own is a one bedroom. It\u2019s about 600 ft.\u00b2. That means every other week there are four people and a dog (and some cats. I\u2019ve also heard) living in that little space.\n\nMy tenant has started getting complaints about three months ago for having her dog off leash. The building is small and relatively tight knit. I don\u2019t live in the same city as the apartment so I didn\u2019t realize that there had been any issues until the first fine came out from the strata. The strata council president (who is a friend) finally told me that there had been numerous attempts to tell her to put her dog on a leash and pick up after him. These verbal warnings were all ignored , she received a fine (which she said she would pay and still hasn\u2019t) in early December. \n\nSince then I have also started getting noise complaints from the other residence. It\u2019s an older wood frame building and the sound insulation is not great, to say the least. At least six other people have told me personally that they have been affected negatively by this tenant- the downstairs ppl directly below the unit wrote an email outlining how they can\u2019t sleep because the kids are up until 2 am seemingly without supervision. \n\nToday was the final straw for me, and the people in the building. The tenant was at work and her ex/baby daddy was apparently babysitting. He took his dog and the tenants dog down to the lobby off their leashes. We have a strict leash policy, and when he ran into the council president, he was politely asked to put his dogs on their leashes. This polite ask escalated to the point where police where called. The altercation distressed several residents. I know this isn\u2019t directly the tenants fault, but her guest was the cause of this and she is the reason he was on the property in the first place. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for posting an eviction? I feel like I\u2019m between a rock and a hard place because everyone wants her gone. I told the strata about the eviction and not one person vouched for her before I posted the notice. I do feel terrible that she probably doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go, and she said she will dispute the notice but I\u2019m as confident as one can be in these situations that she will lose in arbitration given the number of ppl that are supporting it.", "created_utc": 1680144864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1269aja/aita_for_evicting_my_tenant_who_is_a_single/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunately they lied and it\u2019s actually 3 kids ages between 6-16 every week from Thursday - Monday. \nIt\u2019s such a small space and you can hear them all constantly arguing which is likely from all being cramped together. The kids get up early and stay up late and the noise is just constant. From a neighbours perspective it\u2019s really soul destroying - especially because most of the residents in the flat deliberately chose the flats on the basis they were childfree. \nThere have been countless times that I\u2019ve stayed late at work or stayed at a friends rather then trying to relax with stomping, screaming, arguing and kids crying above me. I\u2019ve laid in bed crying tears of frustration desperately just wanting a few minutes of peace. I suffer from severe anxiety and since they moved in above me my mental health has steadily got worse as even when it\u2019s quiet i\u2019m waiting for the noise to start up again. \nThere have been countless complaints made but so far nothing has been done, I think in your situation you\u2019ll be improving your other residents lives in a big way by evicting her. \nI know it\u2019s easy to feel guilty but your tenant got herself into this situation by lying and breaking rules, it\u2019s not fair that other people who follow the rules then suffer for that. \nNo one is going to see a single mother with three kids become homeless, it sounds like her kids would benefit from being in a more suitable space anyway. \nYou might need to get legal advice if she digs her heels in and refuses to leave but I think based on the complaints you\u2019ve had and the warnings you\u2019ve given that you\u2019ve every right to ask her to leave. I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty about it as it sounds like you\u2019ve been lenient enough but you are not responsible for her poor choices.

The only tenant they ever had to evict in 35 years was a 21 year old pregnant woman and it was 100% because she was in *flagrant* violation of the terms of her lease. The apartment was leased to *her* and it ended up that she had her boyfriend, her sister, her sister's boyfriend and their newborn living there, in a tiny 1br apartment. My parents spoke to her three times, reiterating that only SHE could live in the apartment. They might as well have been whistling in the wind.  \n\nEviction proceedings started and the whole crew ended up leaving in the middle of the night about 2 weeks later, stiffing my parents on the rent. Thankfully, they required first and last month's rent as well as a security deposit up front, so they were covered and we had a new tenant 2 weeks later who ended up staying up until my parents sold the house eight years later.\n\nWouldn't you know, crappy tenant ends up sending us a letter asking for her security deposit back about 2 months after leaving  in the dead of night?!??! The nerve! My parents laughed and had their lawyer (a family friend) write up a list of all the damages she left in the apartment as well as the cost to fix each of them, which was in excess of her security deposit, on the firm letterhead. The letter further noted that if she proceeded with any legal action, they would counter-sue for the actual cost of the repairs.\n\nWe never heard from her again...", ">Where is this building that's \"supposed to be childfree\"?
