He was a drunk and a heroin user, (I was, too, but I quit when I found out I was pregnant.) \n\nI got pregnant about year into our two year marriage, because Colby messed with my birth control, since he was \"afraid I was going to leave him\". I got pregnant and gave birth to a wonderful little girl, Anna. Colby didn't work, and there were complications for me from the birth, so we ended up moving in with my parents, and Anna had to sleep in their room because Colby couldn't handle waking up at night and I physically couldn't for a few months while I healed. \n\nWhen Anna was nine months old, my mom died suddenly. Colby wouldn't watch Anna for any of the funeral planning or the funeral itself, and that was the final straw for me. I filed for divorce, Colby willingly gave up his parental rights, justifying his decision by telling me that Anna \"reminded him too much of my mom\" That was twelve years ago. \n\nI never denied Colby's parents access to Anna, and they've remained close, but Colby hasn't ever made an effort to see or speak to me or Anna in 10 years. The last time he spoke to her was when she was two, and that's because we saw him at a store. He had never paid child support.  I met a wonderful man, Lucas, around that same time and we've been together ever since. Anna had called Lucas dad since she was five, and we've had a good life together, he's Anna's dad, in her mind.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Colby's Mom, Linda, called me and said that Colby has finally gotten sober and that he'd like to have a relationship with Anna, and asked if she could give him Anna's phone number. I laughed out loud and said absolutely not. If he wanted a relationship with her, he had had plenty of time to reach out to me, or pay me any child support. Linda replied with \"he just can't hold a job, and he doesn't want to talk to you, just Anna. She needs her real dad in her life.\" I hung up on her. I talked to Anna about it, and she doesn't want to get to know Colby. We changed her phone number.\n\nNow she is blowing up my phone, saying that I'm being selfish for not allowing my daughter to have her \"real dad\" in her life, and how Anna will hate me forever. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Colby was ordered to pay child support, only 75 dollars a month, but hasn't held a job long enough for them to garnish his wages.", "created_utc": 1668200289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysmx3u/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_ex_husband_talk_to_my/", "score": 837, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Any visitation is contingent on his sobriety - how long has he been sober( i think i wouldnt be comfortable with anything under 1 year,) what steps is he taking to maintain his sobriety -aa, therapy etc. Any visit needs to be supervised by you. He may not give expensive gifts. He may not try and manipulate her to get more contact, (asking her directly to do things or asking you in front of her to make you the bad guy.) Ect.
