He was a drunk and a heroin user, (I was, too, but I quit when I found out I was pregnant.) \n\nI got pregnant about year into our two year marriage, because Colby messed with my birth control, since he was \"afraid I was going to leave him\". I got pregnant and gave birth to a wonderful little girl, Anna. Colby didn't work, and there were complications for me from the birth, so we ended up moving in with my parents, and Anna had to sleep in their room because Colby couldn't handle waking up at night and I physically couldn't for a few months while I healed. \n\nWhen Anna was nine months old, my mom died suddenly. Colby wouldn't watch Anna for any of the funeral planning or the funeral itself, and that was the final straw for me. I filed for divorce, Colby willingly gave up his parental rights, justifying his decision by telling me that Anna \"reminded him too much of my mom\" That was twelve years ago. \n\nI never denied Colby's parents access to Anna, and they've remained close, but Colby hasn't ever made an effort to see or speak to me or Anna in 10 years. The last time he spoke to her was when she was two, and that's because we saw him at a store. He had never paid child support.  I met a wonderful man, Lucas, around that same time and we've been together ever since. Anna had called Lucas dad since she was five, and we've had a good life together, he's Anna's dad, in her mind.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Colby's Mom, Linda, called me and said that Colby has finally gotten sober and that he'd like to have a relationship with Anna, and asked if she could give him Anna's phone number. I laughed out loud and said absolutely not. If he wanted a relationship with her, he had had plenty of time to reach out to me, or pay me any child support. Linda replied with \"he just can't hold a job, and he doesn't want to talk to you, just Anna. She needs her real dad in her life.\" I hung up on her. I talked to Anna about it, and she doesn't want to get to know Colby. We changed her phone number.\n\nNow she is blowing up my phone, saying that I'm being selfish for not allowing my daughter to have her \"real dad\" in her life, and how Anna will hate me forever. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668200289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysmx3u/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_ex_husband_talk_to_my/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She just doesn't have the sperm donor in her life.\n\nHe isn't entitled to automatically have a relationship with his bio child because he has suddenly decided he wants one.  He did nothing to take care of her or provide for her.  No help.  No child support.  Nothing.  He will have to wait until Anna is interested in a relationship and that might be never.  That's the consequences of his life choices.", "NTA since you actually asked Anna and she said she doesn\u2019t want to know.", "NTA. I am so sick of these people who basically abandon their kids and then when they decide to grow up or finally get their shit straight, they think they can just walk back in and pick up like years haven't passed.

He gave up his parental rights.\n\nI suggest you think carefully about his parents continued access to Anna if they are pushing for him to have a relationship with her.", "NTA. The fact his mom is calling you instead of him is one of many signs he\u2019s not ready to talk to Anna. Protect your cub, momma bear.", "Your newly sober (supposedly) deadbeat addict ex who isn't stable enough to hold a job OR put his big boy panties on and discuss his request with you directly feels that he's responsible enough to navigate complicated relationship issues with the pre-teen daughter he abandoned and ignored. What could possibly go wrong, right??\n\nYour daughter HAS her real father in her life. That's why she doesn't feel the need to talk to your ex. If he stays clean for an extended period of time, takes responsibility and busts his ass to prove that he is both ready and deserving of the POSSIBILITY of a chance, then you might reconsider a limited, supervised trial period. Or not. \n\nIf he doesn't agree to first prove himself and his sobriety, and respect any boundaries, conditions, or limits, he clearly isn't ready or deserving.", "NTA. No one is entitled to second chances. Besides, Anna has a dad already.", "NTA. but be mindful if she changes her mind and wants to talk to him.

You were nice enough to let his family still have access to Anna.", "NTA, coming from someone who has a deadbeat dad, you\u2019re doing the right thing. He should wait until he has his shit together (holding down a job, getting a place, etc) and gains enough maturity to speak with you about seeing his daughter before he can see her. \n\nHe probably is happy to be sober and see her but he probably needs to have more stability before reentering your daughters life. He should understand that because that\u2019s what would be ultimately best for your daughter, it seems like he\u2019s just thinking of himself. \n\nI think it was a good thing you told your daughter about  the situation so she knows he does think about her and want to see her.", "NTA because you left it up to your daughter.  If you made the decision on your own I'd probably have a different opinion.  But you did the right thing, 100%, by asking your daughter what she wants.  You can explain that to her grandma and if she can't accept that then that's something she needs to come to terms with or lose her visitation privileges as well.", "NTA. \n\nThis should absolutely be the choice of Anna, and since she doesn't want to get to know her biological father, that decision should be honored and respected by all adult involved.", "NTA\n\nIf your daughter knows he exists, knows he wants to meet her, and isn't interested in meeting him, then, you've done your due diligence.", "1\u2022You talked to Anna about it and she doesn\u2019t want to get to know Colby, so it would be wrong for you or anyone else to try and force her to.\n\n2\u2022 Linda saying \u201cshe needs her real dad in her life.\u201d is such a low blow to Lucas who has actually been there for Anna and helped raise her.

If he can't hold a job and helped absolutely nothing with your daughter, he needs more time to \"heal\" or he'll go back to his habits, and you do not need your daughter to even try and make a relationship with him if that's a possibility. He used for what sounds like a decade or more.", "NTA, and you need to remind Linda - a \"real dad\" doesn't bail on their child.  I would keep him far, far away - if he is \"clean\" good for him, he should then understand how detrimental it would be for him to re-enter her life right now.  He is being selfish and so is his mother!  She has Lucas - she is not going without!

Shame on the grandmother for buying into it as well. YOU are her parent and he had ample choice and chance before to be part of her life.\n\nThe statement rhat he doesn't want to talk to you but only Anna is also sketchy and rude.

If you prohibited that, then yeah you would be TA. \n\nI had a deadbeat that I met when I was around 18. He is in my life, sort of, and the relationship is on my terms.

I bet money they'll try to sneak him in for visitation", "NTA. He absolutely is. I get addiction and everything, but it has consequences. He doesn't get to be a dad when he chooses to. If it wasn't important enough for him then, it doesn't change anything now. She has a dad. When she is an adult, she can make the choice, but for now you're being a great mom protecting her from confusion and likely ending up being hurt at some point. Your ex lost his chance and now he has to live with that.", "NTA. He's newly sober, he needs to speak directly to you and not go through other people. If I were you, I'd change your daughters phone number, because while his mother asked if she could give it to him, her reaction at being told no indicates she will anyway.", "NTA his choice to not have a relationship with Anna for 10 years then all of a sudden changed his mind that sounds so stupid", "NTA", "NTA. He gave up his parental rights. Period. This literally means he has no rights to that girl as a parent. You are not obligated to let him see or speak with her. I will say, you do need to have a talk with her about her real dad if you haven\u2019t already. She *does* have the right to know who he is, and when she is old enough, she will be able to make her own decision about whether or not to have a relationship with him.", "NTA from the moment he messed with your birth control, and it only got stronger then.\n\nI\u2019d be rethinking letting Colby\u2019s parents spend time with your daughter.

Even if Colby has gotten sober, changed, and now made amends, neither you nor Anna are obliged to forgive him. \n\nI\u2019d recommend cutting off Colby\u2019s mother as well, since she\u2019s acting so toxically now.

Your the key parental figure this is your choice and she has a father figure in her life. Also, it was good of you to involve Anna to help make the decision.
