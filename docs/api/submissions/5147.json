At 16 your old enough to say I don't want to go to church. That's not family bonding. Your mom trying to force it to keep peace pretty much says it all. Any way you can stay at your dad's?

OP can get your dad involved and revisit the custody arrangements as you are certainly old enough to have an opinion wrt the court.", "NTA - from personal experience I can tell you the worst way to ***\"save\"*** someone is to force them. If you need/want God you'll find Him yourself, if you don't, then you don't. This is coming from someone who was over-churched at a very young age (both my parents have backgrounds in theology, I only attended Christian parochial schools, went to church/chapel every day, etc.etc.) I don't attend anymore mostly because of hypocritical dingbats like your stepdad and the Sunday school teacher.\n\nBut the key here is you're trying to make this whole thing bearable by either offering compromises (voluntarily excluding yourself from \"something we do as a family\" so as not to ruin it for others) or by engaging in the lesson (let's be honest you were calling out your teacher, but I can't blame you for that if he's as incompetent as you say). They're just angry you're not believing their way which 1) isn't how faith works and 2) is controlling as fuck. \n\nTalk to your dad and see if he can help you get out of this because it sounds like an unhealthy environment for you, your education, and your psyche as an impressionable teen. Because the problem with \"keeping the peace\" or \"getting through quietly\" is once you accept that as your only option it will creep into other parts of your life. Again, I speak from experience.

Good luck.", "Nta\n\n\"I'm sorry that you don't actually know how to read what you are supposedly teaching.\"  Boom, solid apology to the AH lol. \n\nYour step dad in is in a cult, and if you show free will, then his kids might think they *gasp* actually have some choice in how they live their lives. \n\nYou have a solid option in your bank pocket though. If your dad is game, you are old enough where the courts will let you choose which parent you live with. Tell your mom, if she pushes the issue again, you'll tell a judge you want to live with your dad full time, and if she keeps pushing the issue, you'll just never talk to her again. \n\nOr... just stay in the house like a sleeper agent, letting your step siblings know that they have a choice in how they live their lives, and that just because their dad is in a cult, they can choose another way.", "ESH including you.

Then came the discussion about the fossil record (which I guess was the summation of this guy's series; he sold used cars so it wasn't like a masterclass or anything). Whew boy.  \n\n\nSo he's set up this long (and stupid) thing and is like \"so what about dinosaur fossils.\" Apparently, according to fucking genius Brother Rodney, \"the fossil record was put there by Satan to make Christians confused.\" My hand shot up. \"Rodney, does that mean that Satan literally created those fossils and put them in the ground at varying strata just to confuse us?\" His response, \"yes, exactly.\" I look perplexed. \"Ok, so people made the fossils and hid them there because they were working for Satan?\"  \n\n\n Rodney: \"No not like that, Satan made the bones and put them there.\"  \n\n\n Me: \"So Satan has the power to create something from nothing. I have to say, Rod, if that's true he must not be all that different from God. Are you sure we're on the right side here?\"   \n\n\nI got kicked out. Later Rodney called my dad (who is similarly religious, but not dumb enough  to believe in creation \"science\"). My dad gave no shits. It was a glorious day.  \n\n\nAll that's to say, hang in there.

This is the greatest thing I have read all day. \n\nA friend of my daughter's tells a similar story about her older sister. Sister, 15 at the time, put a good face on mandatory church attendance at Mom and Step-dad's church up to her baptism in front of the whole congregation. When she hit the water in the baptistry, my daughter's friend's sister started screaming, \"It burns, it burns!\" and acting like she was in agony. \n\nAll the step kids (friend is the youngest of four; prankster was the oldest) were asked never to return to the church.", "NTA\n\nI would understand if Brad offered to take you if you want, and maybe a request to go for Christmas events (I like choral music myself and am atheist as heck), but to order you to go, change your world view and how you view religion is way off.

No-one should be forced to go to church if they don't want to. Jesus never forced anyone to follow him and considering he regularly hang out with prostitutes and defended at least one woman accused of adultery, he probably doesn't care about a woman's clothes and hair as long as she is a good person. Also fun fact from a native Greek speaker, there are several words in the Holy books that even we don't know exactly what they mean . For example it is claimed that saint Paul had spoken against homosexuality, but the word used was \u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, which we are not exactly sure of it's meaning .", "NTA.

Pre-Internet, we would have arguments/discussions and pull out all kinds of books and reference items to prove our point.\n\nTeacher was full of BS.

When I was 17, I got kicked out of Sunday school for asking our nondenominational teacher how she could teach two Episcopalians, a Methodist, an American Baptist and three \u201cI don\u2019t knows\u201d to get into heaven if all Popes went to hell for being the \u201cwrong denomination.\u201d Never had to waste a Sunday morning at church again. Instead, I got to practice my faith in the way that mattered most to me. I got to strengthen my personal relationship with God, instead of just listen to some blow-hard virtue signal.

I hope a solution is found where you don\u2019t have to attend.", "Have you talked to your dad about it?

It's tongue-in-cheek. They're saying that OP ought to use her parents' beliefs against them by pointing out that according to the Bible, God doesn't *want* people who don't believe in or respect him to pretend otherwise. So her *parents'* forcing her to do so is what's disrespectful and hypocritical. Hence why that commenter said to, \"Show respect for their God and stay away\".", "I\u2019m pretty sure the person was saying that stuff facetiously and maybe even suggesting that the OP should use it as an argument.", "I think it can be a location thing too.

There is no reasoning with this level of crazy! In my Methodist church, we do have Bible studies available for adults (it's completely voluntary!) but it's generally the kind of \"lesson\" where they'd have been thrilled to look at a linguistic difference and figure out what happened, and they look at the history from the time period...\n\nThis is NOT that kind of church...this is conform or flee territory and I'd vote with my feet!"]}
