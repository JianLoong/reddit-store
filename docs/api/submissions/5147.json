At 16 your old enough to say I don't want to go to church. That's not family bonding. Your mom trying to force it to keep peace pretty much says it all. Any way you can stay at your dad's?

OP can get your dad involved and revisit the custody arrangements as you are certainly old enough to have an opinion wrt the court.", "NTA - from personal experience I can tell you the worst way to ***\"save\"*** someone is to force them. If you need/want God you'll find Him yourself, if you don't, then you don't. This is coming from someone who was over-churched at a very young age (both my parents have backgrounds in theology, I only attended Christian parochial schools, went to church/chapel every day, etc.etc.) I don't attend anymore mostly because of hypocritical dingbats like your stepdad and the Sunday school teacher.\n\nBut the key here is you're trying to make this whole thing bearable by either offering compromises (voluntarily excluding yourself from \"something we do as a family\" so as not to ruin it for others) or by engaging in the lesson (let's be honest you were calling out your teacher, but I can't blame you for that if he's as incompetent as you say). They're just angry you're not believing their way which 1) isn't how faith works and 2) is controlling as fuck. \n\nTalk to your dad and see if he can help you get out of this because it sounds like an unhealthy environment for you, your education, and your psyche as an impressionable teen. Because the problem with \"keeping the peace\" or \"getting through quietly\" is once you accept that as your only option it will creep into other parts of your life. Again, I speak from experience.

If your dad is game, you are old enough where the courts will let you choose which parent you live with. Tell your mom, if she pushes the issue again, you'll tell a judge you want to live with your dad full time, and if she keeps pushing the issue, you'll just never talk to her again. \n\nOr... just stay in the house like a sleeper agent, letting your step siblings know that they have a choice in how they live their lives, and that just because their dad is in a cult, they can choose another way.", "ESH including you.

Then came the discussion about the fossil record (which I guess was the summation of this guy's series; he sold used cars so it wasn't like a masterclass or anything). Whew boy.  \n\n\nSo he's set up this long (and stupid) thing and is like \"so what about dinosaur fossils.\" Apparently, according to fucking genius Brother Rodney, \"the fossil record was put there by Satan to make Christians confused.\" My hand shot up. \"Rodney, does that mean that Satan literally created those fossils and put them in the ground at varying strata just to confuse us?\" His response, \"yes, exactly.\" I look perplexed. \"Ok, so people made the fossils and hid them there because they were working for Satan?\"  \n\n\n Rodney: \"No not like that, Satan made the bones and put them there.\"  \n\n\n Me: \"So Satan has the power to create something from nothing. I have to say, Rod, if that's true he must not be all that different from God. Are you sure we're on the right side here?\"   \n\n\nI got kicked out. Later Rodney called my dad (who is similarly religious, but not dumb enough  to believe in creation \"science\"). My dad gave no shits. It was a glorious day.  \n\n\nAll that's to say, hang in there.
