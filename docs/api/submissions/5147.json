At 16 your old enough to say I don't want to go to church. That's not family bonding. Your mom trying to force it to keep peace pretty much says it all. Any way you can stay at your dad's?

OP can get your dad involved and revisit the custody arrangements as you are certainly old enough to have an opinion wrt the court.", "NTA - from personal experience I can tell you the worst way to ***\"save\"*** someone is to force them. If you need/want God you'll find Him yourself, if you don't, then you don't. This is coming from someone who was over-churched at a very young age (both my parents have backgrounds in theology, I only attended Christian parochial schools, went to church/chapel every day, etc.etc.) I don't attend anymore mostly because of hypocritical dingbats like your stepdad and the Sunday school teacher.\n\nBut the key here is you're trying to make this whole thing bearable by either offering compromises (voluntarily excluding yourself from \"something we do as a family\" so as not to ruin it for others) or by engaging in the lesson (let's be honest you were calling out your teacher, but I can't blame you for that if he's as incompetent as you say). They're just angry you're not believing their way which 1) isn't how faith works and 2) is controlling as fuck. \n\nTalk to your dad and see if he can help you get out of this because it sounds like an unhealthy environment for you, your education, and your psyche as an impressionable teen. Because the problem with \"keeping the peace\" or \"getting through quietly\" is once you accept that as your only option it will creep into other parts of your life. Again, I speak from experience.

Good luck.", "Nta\n\n\"I'm sorry that you don't actually know how to read what you are supposedly teaching.\"  Boom, solid apology to the AH lol. \n\nYour step dad in is in a cult, and if you show free will, then his kids might think they *gasp* actually have some choice in how they live their lives. \n\nYou have a solid option in your bank pocket though. If your dad is game, you are old enough where the courts will let you choose which parent you live with. Tell your mom, if she pushes the issue again, you'll tell a judge you want to live with your dad full time, and if she keeps pushing the issue, you'll just never talk to her again. \n\nOr... just stay in the house like a sleeper agent, letting your step siblings know that they have a choice in how they live their lives, and that just because their dad is in a cult, they can choose another way.", "ESH including you.

Then came the discussion about the fossil record (which I guess was the summation of this guy's series; he sold used cars so it wasn't like a masterclass or anything). Whew boy.  \n\n\nSo he's set up this long (and stupid) thing and is like \"so what about dinosaur fossils.\" Apparently, according to fucking genius Brother Rodney, \"the fossil record was put there by Satan to make Christians confused.\" My hand shot up. \"Rodney, does that mean that Satan literally created those fossils and put them in the ground at varying strata just to confuse us?\" His response, \"yes, exactly.\" I look perplexed. \"Ok, so people made the fossils and hid them there because they were working for Satan?\"  \n\n\n Rodney: \"No not like that, Satan made the bones and put them there.\"  \n\n\n Me: \"So Satan has the power to create something from nothing. I have to say, Rod, if that's true he must not be all that different from God. Are you sure we're on the right side here?\"   \n\n\nI got kicked out. Later Rodney called my dad (who is similarly religious, but not dumb enough  to believe in creation \"science\"). My dad gave no shits. It was a glorious day.  \n\n\nAll that's to say, hang in there.

The rise in christo-fascism in the USA, at least, is taking us to VERY dangerous places. They want anyone who doesn't conform to their religious beliefs to die. I hope you can get out of there soon. I consider evangelical christian nationalism forced on anyone to be abuse.", "And idiots are really annoying. Don't thump that bible. Open it and read it pal. It admonishes us to study. Clearly Mr. Sunday School Goof Ball missed that section?", "in all fairness - most evangelical churches aren't even this conservative. This sounds more like Duggar level Gothard type nonsense. \n\nOP, they sound a LOT like the Pharasees at the temple and a whole lot less like Jesus.", "Congrats on rooting out that Manichaeist heretic.  Emperor Diocletian declared they should all be burned alive over 1800 years ago.  So this dude must have been hiding pretty well.", "Definitely NTA but how are they making her live under archaic Christian laws they\u2019re just making her go to church once.

Because my fat ass could afford to lose some weight. Sorry, your misspelling was too perfect to pass up.", "In any sort of discussion with someone who is deeply religious, you'll find that \"facts\" don't really matter. \"Facts\" aren't why they believe what they believe, and actual facts really won't change their mind. They repeat some words that they claim justifies their position, but when you decisively prove them wrong their position is entirely unchanged.\n\nGenerally, it's kind of a waste of energy to engage with these people. On the other hand, highlighting to the others in the class how much this dude was BS-ing might have actually been enlightening to some of them!", "Definitely NTA but how are they making her live under archaic Christian laws they\u2019re just making her go to church once a week.

Eventually, he drowns. So then he meets the Lord at the gates of Heaven, he's surprised and asks why He didn't save him. \n\n\n\nThe Lord replies \"I sent you three people to get you out of the water and back to safety!

It was just a thing you did if you were going into science or medicine or something like that and for British and American schools it was kind of a social class thing, too.
