I was assuming he meant marriage because T and M have lived today for 3 years, both have excellent paying jobs and M has brought up how she wants to get married. So when T started telling me about how he wants to get a ring for M I was assuming it was an engagement ring and was very supportive. a few weeks later, he sends me a picture of the ring with the caption \u201c it\u2019s time.\u201d Flash forward to the next night after that text I\u2019m at T and M\u2019s place to pick up something (important to note before going I was drinking at the bar down the street and decided to walk up to their place because they\u2019re about a 5 min walk from there). I get there and we settle in when I noticed the ring on M\u2019s hand and start congratulating them. T corrects me and says that it\u2019s actually a promise ring. I start laughing thinking it\u2019s a joke because T has been known for very inappropriate jokes. M looks down and T starts grilling me on why I would even think that. I say something to the effect of what even is the purpose of a promise ring if you\u2019re already living like a married couple. And that is where M goes off on T, talking about how long she has waited for him to get serious and that the ring seems so meaningless now. She ended up throwing the ring at him and leaving for her parents house. T just watched her leave and told me to stay and sober up but we ended the night in lots of laughs about the situation and a conversation on why it wasn\u2019t an engagement ring (long story short he wants to marry her, he doesn\u2019t even know why he called it a promise ring. Because he agreed that it\u2019s time for marriage.) I leave then the today I now have a bunch of texts from various different people saying I\u2019m an a**hole for laughing about the promise ring and how now M doesn\u2019t want to be with T. T is mad as well saying I need to apologize to M for making her feel like having a promise ring was embarrassing and that M would understand because I was drunk and an Idiot.
