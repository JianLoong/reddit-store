You just didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been looking forward to using the pool that day.\n\nYour daughter is completely valid in not wanting to see them. If it\u2019s been years and she\u2019s still mad, DIL must have done something truly dreadful. And you never discussed this type of situation before you moved into the community. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think your daughter is AH at all, it\u2019s unrealistic to ban your son\u2019s family from your home or the pool. You live there too and your grandkids did nothing wrong. \n\nI do think you owe your daughter an apology and a discussion about how similar situations will be handled in the future.", "NTA.  You have two children. Two set of grandchildren.  Your a Mom and grandmother and love both of them.  I think it's unfair to place boundaries on a mothers love.  My brother and I don't speak and I can't expect my Mom not to have her doors open only for me when my brothers around.  It's selfish way of thinking.", "NTA. You are entitled to have guests use your pool. Would your daughter tell her neighbours that they can't have guests over? \n\nI take it your daughter and son don't get along?", "YTA. \n\n>She ended the call by saying she was here first and I just had to follow her which hurt.\n\nTruth hurts. You did infact follow your daughter to this community to be close to her and her husband. \n\nIt is pretty disrespectful of you to allow your son to use the community pool, knowing that it makes her uncomfortable.  I would be pissed as hell if I were her. She is absolutely right about not being able to enjoy the amenities she pays for. \n\nDon't be shocked when your daughter sells, moves to a new community, and goes low/no contact with you.", "Assuming the HoA rules allow you to have guests\u2026NTA.

Godfuckingdamn - you will not ever win mother of the year. No wonder you find your DIL's behavior acceptable.", "I hope your daughter gets them banned and then moves away from you. YTA.", "> Or was it just to give your son and dil a tool to harass your daughter.\n\n\nBig YTA\n\nI've been on reddit waay too long, my mind immediately went to this possibility. too many evil mothers and MIL's out there.", "Money's On Daughter is already making moving plans and not telling Mom where they are gonna go.", "Are you forgetting that she had grandkids from her son who want to use the pool? So she can\u2019t spend time with her grandkids because daughter can\u2019t be an adult and be in the same outdoor space as her brother?

Let\u2019s be honest that\u2019s who really wants to use the pool anyway.", "> OP, you do know that your son and DIL are NOT coming over every weekend to see YOU!! They come for the free ammenities.\n\nI'm sure they're deriving pleasure from having OP demonstrate once again which child is her favorite.", "I had to scroll really far to find this comment. The daughter should act like an adult and be cordial with her brother and SIL. Don\u2019t have to like them to be around them. My own SIL told lies about me to my husband\u2019s entire family before my wedding. Guess what? I still have to see her and talk to her lol I hate her, but I still have to act like an adult. Daughter is 100% acting bratty and blowing things out of proportion. The mom can\u2019t just stop loving and seeing her own son and grandkids which sounds entirely like what the daughter wants. Mom pays to live there too.", "It\u2019s not her pool. It belongs to the residents of the community, of which her son is not.

I asked OP if she'd asked DIL to apologise to her own daughter, and OP's response was that as DIL's lies about her own daughter hadn't had the effect DIL had hoped for of the rest of the family turning on  OP's daughter, the daughter should just get over it. I think if DIL isn't mature and reasonable enough to acknowledge she behaved badly and she should apologise to her SIL, SIL shouldn't be obliged to spend time with DIL. DIL sounds like a toxic person.  \nOP says she moved to the gated community for the security of knowing her daughter and daughter's husband were living nearby. If the grandkids meant so much to her, why not move somewhere near the son and DIL?  Will she care when her daughter and daughter's husband move?", "Why didn\u2019t you move closer to your precious baby boy rather than your daughter?", "maybe read op\u2019s responses where she admits DIL was needlessly cruel to her daughter. and that some of their own family won\u2019t even talk to her son or DIL anymore lmao", "No your daughter doesn\u2019t need to \u201cget over\u201d.

She is not entitled to determine who her mother brings as a guest to the community pool they share.", "Being in an outdoor public area doesn\u2019t equate to spending time. Also daughter doesn\u2019t have to be anywhere she doesn\u2019t want to be, but to act like OP shouldn\u2019t be able to have her grandkids take advantage of amenities that she pays for is absurd.", "What does that have to do with the grandchildren using the pool? This is an argument between adults.", "I wasn't referring to the pool part. I meant that the daughter is not being a brat or unreasonable. She has every right to refuse to be around them. And it should be no surprise to OP that her daughter has refused to be around them and won't use the pool as long as they are around.\n\nYou said you were on OPs side that the daughter is wrong and a brat but she's not. She's protecting her remaining reputation because I wouldn't put it past the DIL to start her old ways up. Maybe I'm pessimistic but often if people go that route once they will do it again.", "The mother didn\u2019t have to follow her daughter into her new community as she tried to move on from the DIL\u2019s slanderous comments", ">Being in an outdoor public area doesn\u2019t equate to spending time.\n\nDepends how big the pool is.

Clearly the daughter wasn't thrilled that her mother purposefully chose the same gated community (I'm sure she could have found something similar and not in the same community) and now has to handle the fact her own mother thinks her DIL slandering her daughter was fine.\n\nThe daughter is completely right for not wanting someone who so casually tried to do harm to her (may not physically but the kids suffer from lack of family due to lies spread etc) for simply not being in her wedding around her. And thus she's decided to take herself and kids other pools lakes and such to avoid the woman who did so much harm. She's not being a brat she's basically saying \"you guys can have the pool. I'm taking myself and kids elsewhere\" and OP is acting like she's acting unreasonable.\n\nNo one should be forced to be around someone who did them harm, it's a reasonable boundary in place. The daughter chose not to come to the pool anymore since her mother has chosen sides. Simple as that.\n\nWe likely will disagree on this because I find fault in the mother and DIL. Not the daughter.

She lives there. She was there first. Like I said, once, even once every couple weeks would be understandable. There are gated communities that don\u2019t allow guests to use the amenities, OP should consider that before pushing the issue further.
