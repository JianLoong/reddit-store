Appreciate it's annoying when people do that (some people think it's cute and romantic unfortunately), but calling her selfish and throwing the food down is going too far. Carry on like that and you won't have a GF much longer I fear.", "YTA\n\nI completely get not sharing food. Some comments qre asking why you wouldn't share since she's your gf but I'm exactly the same. I don't share food. Mostly due to food insecurity and always being forced to share as a child, whilst getting in trouble if I dared to ask for someone else's food. My gf knows better than to eat my food without asking and she rarely even asks now, although I do offer sometimes.\n\nThe reason you're TA is because YOU DIDN'T TELL HER. You explicitly said 'yeah, sure' then got upset that she did it? Some people do to pick up on sarcasm. It is completely unfair to expect her to respect boundaries that you've never established. And then throwing it on the table in a temper tantrum? How old are you? It's such a minor thing (that was your fault, anyway) and you give a ridiculously dramatic, emotional response. Are you sure you're mature enough for a relationship?", "YTA maybe just growl and snarl like a dog guarding your food.", "YTA. You let her take a bite and then reproach it to her. Beside taking one bite won't kill you. And she proposes to buy more for you, and your answer is getting violent ? Also, you were angry you had less pie because she took one bite, so you slam it and proceed to ruin it and have even less pie because of yourself ? You have anger issue, you are not mature enough to be in a relationship, delusional, and resort to violence over a pie ? Keep waving these red flags high enough so she can't miss them and leave you", "You got mad because your GF wanted a bite of your second apple pie? Even when she told you in advance that she would like a bite of your food before you ordered? What a selfish take. Then again, it is McDonald's. It's not like they're on every corner with the same food available in all waking hours. Oh. Wait.\n\nYTA.", "ESH. I\u2019m not sure that selfish is the way I\u2019d describe the actions; but also, as a woman myself, I do get annoyed, just like OP, when other people, predominantly women though, do stuff like this where they say they\u2019re not hungry, and then have actions that show the opposite, as I think it is rude and inconsiderate. \n\nYou are either hungry or you aren\u2019t. The answer is a simple yes or no. Saying you are not that hungry to someone that is going out to purchase food is entirely misleading, a petty level of deceptive, and a lie by omission. I\u2019d rather people just go ahead and admit that \u201cYes, I\u2019m hungry. However, I might not eat the whole thing tonight. If I do not, I will leave the leftovers in the fridge to have for lunch tomorrow.\u201d or something like that. It is a ton more direct which is good when dealing with these situations. \n\nAnd, on that note, if you lie by omission and say you aren\u2019t hungry then do not steal food *(and yes\u2026asking for a bite when the other person picked out their food based on their own appetite is stealing food)* from other peoples plates when you made the choice to not ask for any yourself.\n\nThat being said OP\u2026.you sort of baited her too. If you had an idea that she was going to pull this stunt (shown by purchasing the second burger and fries) and decided to eat two apple pies on your own, no matter how bad that can be for your health, then you should\u2019ve gotten a third for her. Even if she hadn\u2019t actually eaten it, you could\u2019ve saved it for the next day too\u2026 \n\nYou didn\u2019t do that though, so the argument is partially your doing too and also leads me to believe more is in play for both parties.  I also think that maybe this was a habitual annoyance by your gf and you were trying to prove a point, but maybe using your words, instead of the in the moment food aggression, might\u2019ve been easier and less \u201cjerk\u201dy.", "YTA just say no", "Sorry to say, but if every interaction in your relationship ends up with counting, measuring, comparing, and fighting, you'll never have a lasting relationship.

If it was some expensive thing I\u2019d understand more but it\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s pie. This is extremely petty and shows you don\u2019t understand relationships.

Why couldn't she just have been upfront and asked for what she'd like rather than basically saying \"I'm fine\" when she wasn't. It's much more on her then op. This is understandable, unless shes pregnant, imo. Just like every time woman say \"I'm fine\" they really aren't, just seemingly not wanting to seem too extra. But why? Instead of expressing, instead of fronting. So she hasn't tried the pies before but after trying the 1st pie and liking it whats the issue with getting yourself some next time?. I mean how far are mcds from most locations. Not far. It wasn't do or die and op expected to enjoy those and its understandable to be irritated after her \"not being hungy\" yet eating a whole meal and trying his pie and then the 2nd that made him sarcastic or upset with isnt that wrong compared to his reaction of basically a lie. Like they're 2 for $2 it's not as big of a deal as redditors makes this seem. He is in the right. Nta OP", "Lol, I know. Whenever I do it, I am always wrong and get called out, though! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Agreed. I love when people go around saying \"you're an only child and it shows\" trying to imply we are spoiled or dont know how to share. But all I hear is biggest crime is that I was too bored cause I didnt have a sibling to fight with. We all have our own shit imo (only child or peeps with sibs) but I resent the stereotype that I am spoiled cause my mom chose to just have me cause that what we had time and money for.", "It would be wasted otherwise.  That doesn't really mean anything.", "This was an episode of Friends.", "NTA.  I HATE when people want to take bites or want some of my food to another level.  Can't stand it.  I used to hide my fries from my mom for most of my life.  She always wants a \"taste\" of everything.  She knows what everything I eat tastes like though.  I'd rather also pay for an entire other meal for someone than let them have mine.  I used to let her get away with it but not now.  I flat out refuse.  She gets pissed \ud83d\ude06.  I could have four tiny dumplings as a meal, and she asks for one.  Like this was all I ordered.  \nIt's rude at a certain point and not cute, especially when you don't have a lot.  She'll say there's other things you can have, but no, this is all I ordered for dinner.  \n\nAlthough you should have said no when she asked, she knew you didn't want to share.  It was obvious when you got her an entire meal she didn't want to get.  She just didn't care how you felt.  From now on though, just say no and that you're not sharing.", "NTA. I hate sharing food and won't do it. It's something I'm up front about to everyone I dine with. Considering that I can't think of anything more annoying  then people asking for a bite of my food. Next time just say no or buy an extra one of everything you're eating for some else to have a bite of", "I think you're kidding but I have legit done this to my partner when he comes after my tasty treats \ud83d\ude02 more in a playful manner, but still serious as hell.", "Because being in the presence of food makes people hungry and the bite she took was from a dessert which you really don't need to be hungry to enjoy.", "I get this way sometimes. I can have 0 appetite until I smell some yummy food, or I take a bite of some food. Then suddenly I'm hungry. It just happens...", "Maybe I'm reading into this too far but to me this behaviour goes right into the lizard brain. Sharing food is like \"we're bonded people, we share resources\", and getting someone some food is all \"we provided for someone we love and they're happy, that's great go us\".\n\nThis behaviour says to me \"please put yourself out on my account\".\n\nIs OP going to suffer without his pie? Nope. Is he not getting enough? Probably not. But it really looks to me like she wants to be reassured of his devotion or something by having him give her something he wants for himself.", "At the time she was fine with a bite, her bf bought her a meal and she should let it go to waste? Does your hunger not evolve the longer you wait to eat food? And it wasn\u2019t his *main* meal- it\u2019s a dessert that she wanted a *bite* of. Why be sarcastic when you could be straightforward?", "Eh. A lot of people just want to eat their partner's food because they want the taste of it, but don't want to have a 'meal'. I've seen couples fight over this before. \nHis reaction was definitely over the top, but I hate it when people do that shit to me.", "I think she needs to be more aware of herself.  My wife knows if she wants snacks, ask for them.", "OP seems to be in his first relationship ever. The \"I threw my food\" tantrums over sharing food is a big indicator of that.", "counter point. in my 20 year marriage, time and time again, I was forced to give up a \"bite\" that would turn into 1/2 my sandwich. They do it to be territorial. they do it for control.\n\nthe restaurants that have a \"my date's not hungry\" menu are AWESOME. extra 1/2 order of fries, 1/2 versions of the top entrees.\n\nPenn Jillette says that the most loving thing you can say to another person is, \"I'm cooking bacon, how many pieces do you want?\"\n\nI say, nip that just a bite BS right in the bud! nip it!", "It\u2019s very obvious in this thread who\u2019s had chronic food poachers in their life and who hasn\u2019t.", "Not surprised I had to scroll so far to see a fellow NTA. Nothing annoys me more than someone that does just this.  I'm not hungry but I'll have a bite of yours. I have had so many times that's just turned into basically sharing a meal.  OP was smart trying to get ahead of this by buying something even though she said she didn't want anything.", "She acted like the mouse in \u201cif you give a mouse a cookie.\u201d", "Hell no. My wife even jokes about how Tapas is my worst nightmare.\n\nIf we're fine dining, we'll share a bite so we can both experience the food. But a nacho or a bite of a big mac? If you wanted one, you should have gotten one.", "Agreed. But my youngest is effectively an only child. I asked him what he wanted for his birthday.\n\nNothing: I have everything I need. A newer laptop for school work, a kindle for watching history videos, a very good 2 year old phone, a large bedroom, musical instruments, clothes etc \n\nPersonally, I feel like I\u2019ve done something right \u2026 he appreciates what he has and understands that he wants for nothing.", "In 20 years, they\u2019re still tossing and turning all night, playing over ever nuance of this interaction.
