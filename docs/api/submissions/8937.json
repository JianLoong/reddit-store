I sarcastically said \u201cYeah, sure\u201d and was surprised when she actually took a small bite. \n\nI was really annoyed because i had already gotten her her own burger and i couldnt understand why she felt the need to take a bite out of every food I have.

Appreciate it's annoying when people do that (some people think it's cute and romantic unfortunately), but calling her selfish and throwing the food down is going too far. Carry on like that and you won't have a GF much longer I fear.", "YTA\n\nI completely get not sharing food. Some comments qre asking why you wouldn't share since she's your gf but I'm exactly the same. I don't share food. Mostly due to food insecurity and always being forced to share as a child, whilst getting in trouble if I dared to ask for someone else's food. My gf knows better than to eat my food without asking and she rarely even asks now, although I do offer sometimes.\n\nThe reason you're TA is because YOU DIDN'T TELL HER. You explicitly said 'yeah, sure' then got upset that she did it? Some people do to pick up on sarcasm. It is completely unfair to expect her to respect boundaries that you've never established. And then throwing it on the table in a temper tantrum? How old are you? It's such a minor thing (that was your fault, anyway) and you give a ridiculously dramatic, emotional response. Are you sure you're mature enough for a relationship?", "YTA maybe just growl and snarl like a dog guarding your food.", "YTA. You let her take a bite and then reproach it to her. Beside taking one bite won't kill you. And she proposes to buy more for you, and your answer is getting violent ? Also, you were angry you had less pie because she took one bite, so you slam it and proceed to ruin it and have even less pie because of yourself ? You have anger issue, you are not mature enough to be in a relationship, delusional, and resort to violence over a pie ? Keep waving these red flags high enough so she can't miss them and leave you", "You got mad because your GF wanted a bite of your second apple pie? Even when she told you in advance that she would like a bite of your food before you ordered? What a selfish take. Then again, it is McDonald's. It's not like they're on every corner with the same food available in all waking hours. Oh. Wait.\n\nYTA.", "ESH. I\u2019m not sure that selfish is the way I\u2019d describe the actions; but also, as a woman myself, I do get annoyed, just like OP, when other people, predominantly women though, do stuff like this where they say they\u2019re not hungry, and then have actions that show the opposite, as I think it is rude and inconsiderate. \n\nYou are either hungry or you aren\u2019t. The answer is a simple yes or no. Saying you are not that hungry to someone that is going out to purchase food is entirely misleading, a petty level of deceptive, and a lie by omission. I\u2019d rather people just go ahead and admit that \u201cYes, I\u2019m hungry. However, I might not eat the whole thing tonight. If I do not, I will leave the leftovers in the fridge to have for lunch tomorrow.\u201d or something like that. It is a ton more direct which is good when dealing with these situations. \n\nAnd, on that note, if you lie by omission and say you aren\u2019t hungry then do not steal food *(and yes\u2026asking for a bite when the other person picked out their food based on their own appetite is stealing food)* from other peoples plates when you made the choice to not ask for any yourself.\n\nThat being said OP\u2026.you sort of baited her too. If you had an idea that she was going to pull this stunt (shown by purchasing the second burger and fries) and decided to eat two apple pies on your own, no matter how bad that can be for your health, then you should\u2019ve gotten a third for her. Even if she hadn\u2019t actually eaten it, you could\u2019ve saved it for the next day too\u2026 \n\nYou didn\u2019t do that though, so the argument is partially your doing too and also leads me to believe more is in play for both parties.  I also think that maybe this was a habitual annoyance by your gf and you were trying to prove a point, but maybe using your words, instead of the in the moment food aggression, might\u2019ve been easier and less \u201cjerk\u201dy.", "YTA just say no", "Sorry to say, but if every interaction in your relationship ends up with counting, measuring, comparing, and fighting, you'll never have a lasting relationship.

If it was some expensive thing I\u2019d understand more but it\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s pie. This is extremely petty and shows you don\u2019t understand relationships.

A grown child who doesn't know how to share or treat other people with respect or compassion.", "I'm an only child as well so I know what you mean, it is always a shock to people when I say that I am. I fully admit to them that I'm spoiled. There's a difference, however, to being spoiled and being spoiled rotten. OP reeks of possibly having been spoiled rotten. (OP, YTA btw)", "He was willing to share by getting her, her own food. He handled this poorly but the fact that he doesn't like people eating off his plate doesn't have any bearing on if he's ready or not for a relationship.", "Yeah the fact that he bought her, her own burger and extra fries. To me at least makes it clear this isn't a one time thing. It's definitely an assumption and I hope OP clarifies, but I'd bet on it.", "Maybe. But as whiny as he was about a bite of apple pie, I feel like he would've said something to the effect of, \"she does this to me all the time.\"", "She asked if she could have a bite before he even bought the food. Not wanting to share, he bought her her own burger and fries. The only food she took bites from was the pie, which he gave her permission for. Nothing here suggests this is a repeating pattern.\n\nOP is the AH.", "You're a little insane", "Are your massive insecurities the reason you have to answer every single post mentioning you really have problems if asking your SO for a bite is a power play in your eyes? Or did you just never experienced a relationship?", "I mean he clearly did share, bought his gf her own burger, shared the extra fries, & a bit of his apple pie. All when she said that she wasn't that hungry. \n\nHe should have communicated like an adult, but it's fair to not like having people pecking at your food. & the gf's an adult as well, if she ate all that she was hungry and should've have communicated that.", "Someone got dumped by an only child and is still working through their feelings.", "I think it's fair to assume she does this all the time given how she asked for multiple bites of OPs food within just this one meal.", "Thanks for that diagnosis, doctor.", "No, I just enjoy knocking people off their moral high ground when their words or actions indicate they have no business being there.", "Maybe. I don't like to assume too much, as it never works out when I do, lol.", "Fair enough. I just have trouble believing someone would do this, asking for a bite of their SOs food, only once. \n\nIf it was a fancy meal or something, then maybe. But this was McDonald's. It is by no means a fancy place that you let your SO try your food because it's crazy expensive and you're not likely to go back any time soon. \n\nI have no issue with assuming she asks for bites frequently in light of this."]}
