Appreciate it's annoying when people do that (some people think it's cute and romantic unfortunately), but calling her selfish and throwing the food down is going too far. Carry on like that and you won't have a GF much longer I fear.", "YTA\n\nI completely get not sharing food. Some comments qre asking why you wouldn't share since she's your gf but I'm exactly the same. I don't share food. Mostly due to food insecurity and always being forced to share as a child, whilst getting in trouble if I dared to ask for someone else's food. My gf knows better than to eat my food without asking and she rarely even asks now, although I do offer sometimes.\n\nThe reason you're TA is because YOU DIDN'T TELL HER. You explicitly said 'yeah, sure' then got upset that she did it? Some people do to pick up on sarcasm. It is completely unfair to expect her to respect boundaries that you've never established. And then throwing it on the table in a temper tantrum? How old are you? It's such a minor thing (that was your fault, anyway) and you give a ridiculously dramatic, emotional response. Are you sure you're mature enough for a relationship?", "YTA maybe just growl and snarl like a dog guarding your food.", "YTA. You let her take a bite and then reproach it to her. Beside taking one bite won't kill you. And she proposes to buy more for you, and your answer is getting violent ? Also, you were angry you had less pie because she took one bite, so you slam it and proceed to ruin it and have even less pie because of yourself ? You have anger issue, you are not mature enough to be in a relationship, delusional, and resort to violence over a pie ? Keep waving these red flags high enough so she can't miss them and leave you", "You got mad because your GF wanted a bite of your second apple pie? Even when she told you in advance that she would like a bite of your food before you ordered? What a selfish take. Then again, it is McDonald's. It's not like they're on every corner with the same food available in all waking hours. Oh. Wait.\n\nYTA.", "ESH. I\u2019m not sure that selfish is the way I\u2019d describe the actions; but also, as a woman myself, I do get annoyed, just like OP, when other people, predominantly women though, do stuff like this where they say they\u2019re not hungry, and then have actions that show the opposite, as I think it is rude and inconsiderate. \n\nYou are either hungry or you aren\u2019t. The answer is a simple yes or no. Saying you are not that hungry to someone that is going out to purchase food is entirely misleading, a petty level of deceptive, and a lie by omission. I\u2019d rather people just go ahead and admit that \u201cYes, I\u2019m hungry. However, I might not eat the whole thing tonight. If I do not, I will leave the leftovers in the fridge to have for lunch tomorrow.\u201d or something like that. It is a ton more direct which is good when dealing with these situations. \n\nAnd, on that note, if you lie by omission and say you aren\u2019t hungry then do not steal food *(and yes\u2026asking for a bite when the other person picked out their food based on their own appetite is stealing food)* from other peoples plates when you made the choice to not ask for any yourself.\n\nThat being said OP\u2026.you sort of baited her too. If you had an idea that she was going to pull this stunt (shown by purchasing the second burger and fries) and decided to eat two apple pies on your own, no matter how bad that can be for your health, then you should\u2019ve gotten a third for her. Even if she hadn\u2019t actually eaten it, you could\u2019ve saved it for the next day too\u2026 \n\nYou didn\u2019t do that though, so the argument is partially your doing too and also leads me to believe more is in play for both parties.  I also think that maybe this was a habitual annoyance by your gf and you were trying to prove a point, but maybe using your words, instead of the in the moment food aggression, might\u2019ve been easier and less \u201cjerk\u201dy.", "YTA just say no", "Sorry to say, but if every interaction in your relationship ends up with counting, measuring, comparing, and fighting, you'll never have a lasting relationship.

If it was some expensive thing I\u2019d understand more but it\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s pie. This is extremely petty and shows you don\u2019t understand relationships.

That\u2019s good! Can I have one more? \n\nIt\u2019s not like she insisted on taking a bite out of his burger or friends after already eating her own.", "It's true, but at the same time... Com on, you are an adult, you should know how it works, it's not like it's the first time you ever see ordered food (\"you\" generic). There are too many adults who still behave like this, always saying they aren't hungry and then asking to eat from other people's portion... It can happen, sure, but at the 5th time you should learn and just place your order as well. Personally, I find it something to correct in someone's behaviour, it's very irritating and now that I am an adult I am very transparent in saying that I don't like this behaviour (yes, many people do this). One bite (usually reciprocal) is very different and useful to try new flavours, but there is this kind of people who always (and only) eat from your order and not even small bites... That thing is irritating. Just place your order lol.", "> It\u2019s completely fair and understandable.\n\nThe first time. But if it's happened in the past just ask for something small vs eating off someones plate", "But if you know that the smell of the food will make you want some like it does every. single. time. why not just ask for your own food? Some people order enough for themselves and don't like feeling shorted when \"just wants a bite\" leaves them with less than they wanted.\n\nShe ate her entire burger and the extra large fries and still came for his food!", "She literally planned to take bites of his food. I'm not hungry, I'll eat bites of yours  is a power play.", "Does the girlfriend suck for not reading minds?", "Yep, my sister would always get mad if I asked her to borrow something of hers, although she had no problem taking my things from me without my knowledge. Having siblings didn't tech her sharing (and definitely not kindness)", "I'm honestly one of those people who hates sharing. Especially my food. Not only am I autistic but growing up nothing was ever mine and now I get irrationally irritated when people take my food. Grew up with like 8 of my 11 siblings regularly in my life.", "Yeah. I've known quite a few people where their sibling relationships meant constant competition, especially over food. They'll scarf down an entire meal in like 2 minutes. Meanwhile, having grown up as an only child myself, I take my sweet time and have no issues sharing bites.", "Thank you for this.", "I had to Google that. They used potatoes back in the 70's. Now they use apples.", "I think it's a bit of a regular problem... Usually people are regularly doing this. My sister is like that, ALWAYS saying she doesn't want the full order but ending up always wanting some bites and reducing other people's portions. I admit it's a bit annoying because it's constant (of course I love her and everyone has their faults, nothing terrible). It's rare that people just do it sometimes and people got mad... Usually if people are irritated is because there is a pattern.", "\"Hey can I have a bite of your pie? I may have asked you to get me one myself, but I've never tried one before and I don't know if I would like it\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\\*takes small bite\\* \"oh it is good! can I have another bite?\"\n\n\"what kind of sick power play are you inflicting on me, you cruel emotional abuser?\"", "It's not really a germs issue... just don't want to share bites off of food that's in one piece.  We do share food but we don't bite into it.  If we share something we will cut it in half.  For me it's because my mom used to always demand bites of my food and she always ate very sloppy and she would get spit all over my food then I'd get disgusted and not want to eat it.  For my mom it absolutely was a power play.\n\nBut yea it comes off as a power play to see if he will let her take food from him.  It is incredibly annoying to be around people who want to take bites of your food all the time.  I don't mind sharing food but if I'm hungry I order what I want to eat.  If I'm expected to share I'd probably order differently or order more.  The reason I think this is an ongoing issue is because he tried to prevent it by ordering her her own food.  I think he over reacted and he should have told her no.", "And then the fight starts there, ha\n\nI agree, it's a power play", "She asked. \n\nHe said yes. \n\nHe got mad.", "Nowhere in that post does it say that.", "For real.. some people have just got such a bee in their bonnet about food, especially in regards to girlfriends. She even offered to get him a whole new one because of two bites like im pretty sure if he'd said no she would have just gotten herself one.", "Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but he said he had 2 pies, she ate one, and then also wanted 2 bites out of his. I don\u2019t think he needed to throw anything or get huffy, but it is annoying when someone refuses to acknowledge their own appetite. She went from \u201cI\u2019ll just take a bite of your burger\u201d, to a whole burger, fries, an apple pie and 2 bites of his. Why didn\u2019t she just say she was hungry and get a meal? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0for why didn\u2019t she just go get more lol no one should have an attitude but she probably does do that all the time. I know a lot of girls who CONSTATLY lie about being hungry and then gobble up their bf\u2019s food. It\u2019s not cute", "I mean though\u2026\n\nDid she take a bite of the apple pie because she\u2019s always wanted to try it, or because OP bought a couple and so they were available to her?\n\nI feel like if she was trying it for the former reason, then she simply could\u2019ve asked him to pick one up,  even if she \u201cwasn\u2019t that hungry\u201d. Many people I know who are not that hungry will eat just a dessert and not the dinner to go with it. \n\nThe fact that she seems to have only brought it up once they, the pies, were in front of her makes it seem like she did want it just because OP had it and not out of any extra interest. And that\u2019s pretty entitled if you ask me\u2026", "\"Wow, the number of people laughing at how ridiculous I am is impressive.\"", "No, but she does suck for not communicating that she was hungry and wanted food from McDonalds when it was offered.", "I know a lot of only-childs and most aren't this childish. Stfu with the generalisation.", "Damn, what only child hurt you so bad? GTFO with these garbage generalizations.", "Man, you really sound like someone with siblings right now - jealous and didn't get enough attention", "They were using them well into the 80s. I remember trying one when I was about 6. It was truly awful.", "I'm not agreeing with OP, but I think the weird part, where people start speculating on head games, isn't that she wanted a second bite of the same apple pie. It's that she wanted a bite of the second pie. From the description, it sounds less like GF wanted her own food, and more like she wanted to bite literally every thing that OP had. She could have just eaten one pie, but instead bit both of them.", "It is hard to say no to the grab. Especially in midreach. I\u2019m", "I reread it and you're right.  \n\nI think her saying \"I'll just have a bite of your burger\" and that he bought her her own to avoid that leads me to believe that she often wants bites of his food.\n\nHe should have just gave her the second pie and he did over react but I have to admit someone wanting bites of my food would drive me nuts.", "Yeah, it's one of those \"reddit is filled with unsocialized basement dwellers\" things.  Sharing food with your family and close friends is basic human behavior (heck, most animals do it as well) but here you'll get a disproportionately high number of people who can't fathom that.", "He had two pies and she asked for a bite, and she took a 2nd bite. She never ate one full pie and it seemed like OP got two pies because he wanted both for himself", ">She was curious as she\u2019s never had that before and asked if she could take a bite. I let her. When I started eating the second one, she asked for another bite again.\n\nYou're incorrect. He ate the first one and intended to eat the second one as well but then threw a tantrum and the pie (literally).", "Then he should have said no. Instead he said yes, and got mad when she did the thing he said yes to. That's not sensible and it makes him the AH", "This is DEFINITELY a repeating pattern. The \"bite takers\" always do that and then say \"It's just a bite\".", "I'm not at all saying OP is right, but to be fair the girlfriend clearly has communication issues too. He did ask her if she wanted food, gf responds by saying no and proceeded to ask him for bites of his food. (Which is already annoying, in my opinion) When he went ahead and acted on his assumption and bought her food regardless, she ate it. If she was hungry, she could have just said so. Sounds like it's an issue for both of them to work on, especially if something as simple as this escalated so quickly. \n\nYTA op", "It was kinda hard to tell from the way the story was written, I thought she took a bite from the first pie, he finished it, *then* she wanted a bite from the second pie, but if it's what you're talking about then yeah, I agree, that's odd. Maybe a power play, maybe an OCD thing or something.", "There was no grab. She was not midreach. She ASKED first. If he can't say no or accept that she asked for a small bite of a $1 pie from a crappy fast food chain, then he has no business being in a relationship.", "Fair enough. It doesnt bother me if my husband eats some of my food; he usually finishes it anyway, lol. Personal feelings are definitely a factor here.", "Yeah I can understand that people might have some reasons for not wanting to share but its the way they act like even asking is the most insane entitlement.", "Nah. Huge difference in making a big meal and sharing it versus someone wanting to take a bite out of my specific plate. OP went out of his way to buy GF her own burger and extra fries. He definitely overreacted in throwing the pie but people arent basement dwellers for not wanting to share the food on their plate", "Okay okay I appreciate the clarity. He honestly should\u2019ve got 3 pies. It\u2019s annoying that she is like that, but idk sometimes you just suck shit up for the sake of peace.", "I agree I think it's ESH though, she didn't handle this well either. If he communicated better and just said he didn't want to share she'd be TA", "You're right, it's hard to tell. It may have gone in the order you said. If she took a bite of the first, he quickly finished it, then she wanted another bite, and only the second was left, then that eliminates the last scrap of sympathy I might have had for him.", "$1.99 pie.\n\nIt's only a dollar if you get the 2 for $2 for just one cent mor...\n\nOh wait, he did. LOL\n\n2 pies. The unselfish thing to do, when she asked for a bite of the first pie would be to just give her one of the two pies, tbh. \n\nI mean, if she does it all the time, of course don't enable the mooching, but if this incident just happened the way that OP described then yeah, OP is for sure the AH.", "Not in that one, anyhow. They both sound exhausting,", "OP might have some food issues. I don't mind sharing food that I bought to share with people. I love cooking for people. \nIf I bought food for 'me' though, I will cut off your hand. That's mine. I bought *exactly* the amount I wanted. Get your own. \n\nAnd it is a huge thing that people will say they aren't hungry but nibble off their partner's plates. I am a woman, and it makes me want to throttle people. It's not about sharing food, it's about offering someone food, them refusing, and you get as much as you need, and then they want to eat *that*. It's frustrating. Especially if it happens a lot.\nHe bought her her own damn food, and she still wanted his food. Sure, it was \"just a bite\" but...this probably isn't the first time. If not with her, then with someone else in his family/friends.", "I kind of agree, to be honest. I may change my vote. I might be a little biased was my concern, because I absolutely hate sharing my food or drinks. It's a germ thing for me though. With partners I can tolerate it, but it's still not my favorite thing to do.", "Oh wow! Last time I was there they were like 2/$1.00, lol.", "There is no evidence that this is an ongoing issue, either. I have no doubt that OP would have shared that if it were. \n\nI think they are very young, and drama over things that seem small to others ensues on a regular basis."]}
