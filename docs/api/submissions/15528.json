How can someone take on bigger projects if they\u2019re forced to hand them over to other members of staff and excluded from meetings regarding them? I\u2019ve heard stories like this from women hundreds of times, it\u2019s not at all unusual or uncommon.\n\nThis is unfortunately the norm for many male-dominated environments.

Yeah, bud, that\u2019s sexism. \n\nSo what HR didn\u2019t find anything? HR\u2019s job is the protect the company, not her.

I don't think so. I can imagine that makes her feel like they treat her as a secretary. Why aren't the men being asked to take notes? You need to wake up and start trying to see things from her perspective. As a man, you're not qualified to comment on what it's like to be a woman in the workplace and should listen more, comment less.", " The part of this that really makes me think you might be TA is where you say \u201cshe judges co workers for things they say that have nothing to do about work\u201d. \nWhy shouldn\u2019t she? I don\u2019t understand your logic here. Surely this is an example of the existence of subconscious sexism within the industry? Which you acknowledge exists? Realistically this will boil down to how you approached the conversation. There is a huge difference between \u201cyou need to work harder\u201d and \u201cprove them wrong and make a difference in the industry\u201d, however both essentially have the same outcome. Be supportive, accept the injustices she experiences.", "YTA\n\nI worked as a software consultant and got to the position where I was the lead for a department, I was one of 2 women and whenever I would set up meetings with companies (mostly male dominated companies) I would always be asked by the clients to make them a cup of tea or coffee whilst they got the meeting started, or if I could take notes to email them. \n\nAlways had to respond with, \u2018Can do, but the meeting doesn\u2019t start without me as I\u2019m your lead.\u2019 Or \u2018I can\u2019t lead the meeting and take comprehensive notes.\u2019\n\nMy two colleagues that worked with me were male and they always assumed they were the leads and I was the \u2018admin\u2019. I have a male sounding name so that would have been a confusion, but I always called to set up the meetings and introduced myself and my role. I\u2019d ask the questions and they would answer to my colleagues. \n\nSo yes, there is everyday sexism in workplaces that you do not see. You are blind to it because you don\u2019t know you\u2019re doing it (if you are) or you don\u2019t see it because it\u2019s normal to you. \n\nThe company I worked for were so so with the sexism. Yes I rose through the company to the lead position but it took a lot of proving myself, taking initiative and insisting that my projects not her handed over. Literally refusing to hand it over unless there was a good enough reason. I wouldn\u2019t accept weak reasons and had to be firm and vocal about knowing what I was doing. Me and a male colleague joined the company at the same time. I had more industry experience (4ish years) and this was his first ever job, I had to fight to get the salary I was paid (I wanted X, they offered Y which was much lower and I bargained for Z which was in the middle), my male colleague was offered the X I wanted with no bargaining. They never even asked him how much he wanted. Yes the hiring committee were male as well. \n\nMy partner refused to believe that there was so much sexism in the industry as well until I told him about the salary stuff above.

You and her both have the same amount of experience in the industry, and she graduated with a 4.0 and honors so obviously she knows what she's doing just as much as you do (if not more).\n\nShe is given projects that are then taken from her, not invited to meetings, invited to meetings to *take notes* (genuine question: have you ever been asked to take notes in a meeting? She isn't a secretary, she has the same qualifications as you.), and her coworkers say sexist things about their wives and girlfriends. It's bad enough that her *and another woman* made an official complaint to HR.\n\nYou seem to think your girlfriend is blaming sexism even though by your own recount of her work environment, sexism is an issue. Which is no surprise, because you work in a historically sexist industry. Instead of telling your girlfriend to work harder or suck it up, you should really try listening to her and providing support.", "If you're a man, maybe just listen to her and sympathize with being a woman in a male dominated field.

I have a CS/math degree and she has an electrical / electronics engineering degree.\n\nI have been promoted to a senior level at my company and she has been promoted only once and is still a junior at her company.\n\nShe always complains about how things are unfair at all jobs she had (3 so far) and how she is not given opportunities, supposedly excluded from meetings (while still claiming she gets asked to take notes in meetings) and decisions.She judges her coworkers for things they say that have nothing to do about work like when they talk about their wives and partners.\n\nShe and another woman once complained about a coworker for being rude in meetings and HR (which was dealt with by a woman) did not find anything wrong and dismissed their concerns.\n\nShe recently had a performance review and was not promoted and told that she needs to take on more challenges and told me that she does but is always told to hand over projects to other people when she starts them and excluded from the meetings.\n\nI do believe that there is some sexism in the industry but I think she cannot blame everything on sexism and recognize that perhaps she has room to improve. She thinks that because she graduated with honors with a 4.0 that translates to industry performance. Her degree is also in electronics and more hardware focused. I expressed this to her and suggested she follow her manager's advice to grow and she got upset with me and called me an AH. I get her disappointment but I don't think it is fair for her to expect me to just agree to everything she says.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No t \u2018challenge the ideas\u2019", "I had a boyfriend like you when I was working in a really sexist workplace at the start of my career. My manager completely overlooked my achievements and only acknowledged begrudgingly when I was the top performer and everyone in the team started to take notice.  I was not given challenging work, opportunities or anything even I had proven time and again I was good at it. I was young and didn't realize what I was up against. My boyfriend would dismiss my concerns. I started to doubt my own abilities.\n\nIt was only after I moved to a different company where my manager was supportive and encouraging that I was really able to spread my wings. And I had dumped by AH boyfriend by then. Sexism in the tech-industry is rampant. So many men are threatened by women doing well. \n\nNote-taking  as most people have mentioned is inherently sexist. Think pretty secretaries walking behind the big boss man taking notes!! and so many men in tech would love to bring back the good ol days.\n\nYou are chipping away at her self-worth by not acknowledging what she is going through. And no, she is not imagining it. Support her or get out the way. She needs a new job and a better partner.\n\nand if it wasnt clear yet YTA!", "Your edit sounds more like it. Remember that women can have internalized misogyny, so a woman brushing off sexism isn't that surprising. You wanna believe society is past that, and I get it.

I\u2019ve been invited to meetings to take notes, run presentations, and any time someone wants a office holiday party or get together it gets delegated to one of us women in office. I had a male coworker make very inappropriate sexualized comments to me, yet when I reported it to my supervisor & Dept head, they sent me to training for \u201chow to deal with difficult people\u201d. Some of the first questions I\u2019ve gotten asked when starting a new team include \u201cwhy\u201d I don\u2019t have kids yet, and comments about \u201cnot getting younger\u201d.

When I just stared at him he proceeded to explain to me that it was a compliment. Luckily the owner of the company was in the room and told the client he doesn\u2019t look like the kind of client we want so the meeting was canceled. Then he explained to the client it was a compliment. \n\nI was very lucky that our company owner was raised by a single mom and would not put up with this type of attitude from anyone but I\u2019ve worked for companies that would absolutely think this is acceptable.", "Your GF should break up with you.

Don\u2019t use HR not ruling in her favor as a sign that her complaints were unfounded.", "YTA\n\nThere are so many people who have explained to you, in fantastic detail, how sexist the world still is, and your conclusion is to look it up because you can\u2019t wrap your head around it.

It\u2019s really frustrating. My brother never really listens when I tell him about it and always down plays it and it makes me feel bad about myself. I\u2019m sure your gf is looking for a sympathetic ear and you add further stress to her. Just listen to her and believe her. What does it do to you if you agree with her that it\u2019s frustrating instead of telling her it\u2019s her fault? Are you trying to help her succeed or are you trying to make her feel bad about herself? Sometimes your partner just wants to vent and doesn\u2019t want you to try and fix their problems.

I bet you'll start to notice things you brushed off as insignificant before. I experienced so much daily sexist stuff as a female engineer in Silicon Valley. But a lot of it is a blur now. What I remember most clearly is the day I was \"voluntold\" to take notes for the third meeting in a row and a respected male principle engineer looked up and said \"is she the only one with working fingers around here?\" I could have hugged that guy. If you've been promoted a few times, you could be that person for someone too.\n\nEta I just realized you said she was in EE. I was also a hardware engineer and it is real, real bad in HWE. You should believe her no matter her discipline but EE is extra awful for women.", "Things are going backwards. I wish men could disguise themselves as women and get a taste of it.

Think about this:\n\nDo men get invited to meetings to take notes, or do they get invited to participate? Sounds like she is telling you that she gets invited to the meetings not to participate, but to take notes. Women are apparently secretaries.\n\nDo projects men think up and try to spearhead to build their leadership skills get taken away? Probably not as often as it does for women. \n\nAre men rude to other men in meetings the way that they were to her and her other lady colleague? Probably not. The condescension is real.\n\nSexism isn't super blatant most of the time -- it's the little things that seem minor to men because it happens so infrequently to them that they don't see what the big deal is.

Obviously sexist if they were saying those things if they are not true but there would be no way for her to know without knowing their partners.\n\nHer main complaint is that she is prohibited from doing work and projects she starts are taken over by others and then she is excluded from the meetings about them despite being willing to continue them.

Surely anyone who has ever been in a professional meeting of any kind *must* know that?!", "In our dei workgroup we even made the CEO and corporate sponsor take notes, but it definitely all stemmed from our very first meeting where someone just volunteered a woman to be the note taker.", "See but there\u2019s a right way to give constructive criticism without dismissing her feelings", "I have worked with more women than just them and from my experience the women have on average been better performers, and the two I mentioned with exceptional qualifications like a Berkley PhD are the best I have ever worked with and more qualified than myself by far.", "I think she is being held back by it but I don't think it could possibly be the only reason,it almost sounds like 1950s level sexism the way she describes it.", "I did not say that, I said that those coworkers would be sexist for saying that about their wives if those things did not happen and they made it up.", "You don\u2019t always start back at the bottom each time you take a new job.", "Wow, I got downvoted for that?! Ok, let me explain. Being intellectually smart does not set you up for a career in industry. I have a PhD from one of the best universities in the world, it did not help much when i needed to interact with managers and customers. The OP is implying this might be the case when it comes to his GF. He might be right, or he might be making a sexist assumption. Either way, it is his opinion, not mine, so do cut down on the hate.", "That absolutely happens. You just never experienced it cause you have a penis.", "How many times have you been invited to meetings to take notes?", "I have more than one degree and around 20 years experience in design and marketing and my boss only has me come to meetings to take notes.", "Yes, sexism is fundamentally illogical.", "I am sure norms differ - most of my meetings don't have terribly intense expectations for minutes and I can often get a few comments in while note-taking. But as a general rule, being asked (or, more commonly, volun-told) to take notes means you are singled out as the least likely to contribute. I am at the lowest rung of leadership in my organization, and one of my biggest gripes about my current position is that it has evolved into several recurring meetings that I am expected to run, meaningfully contribute to, and take notes. It is...not possible and I am currently working to divest myself of minute-taking duties.", "So your experiences are going to trump your girlfriends?", "So this is exactly the point that dueltone is making. The women on average are better performers. They have to be excellent to be in the same roles where men just have to be good. Where are all the women who perform similarly to  the men instead of better? They are stuck taking notes like your girlfriend.", "They perform better *because they have to in order to progress*\nWomen have to work more hours, be better, achieve more, all while being pretty and nice and putting up with people like you doubting their experiences, all this just to be given a chance at being let into the boy's club.", "So what you\u2019re saying is women have to be incredibly more qualified and hardworking. Do you hear yourself at all?", "So you do see a connection between women having exceptional qualifications and work ethic in order to gain equal standing to men? \n\nA young tech professional I know was in a meeting where a woman gave a presentation on the status of a project she was heading up. She was articulate, well-organized, and informative. At the conclusion her male supervisor opened comments by saying, in front of their male boss and several coworkers (both male and female), \u201c*I really couldn\u2019t follow it. The sound of your voice is so annoying I stopped listening after the first couple minutes.\u201d*", "Women have only been allowed to have bank accounts of their own starting in the 1970s, marital rape wasn't outlawed until the 90s. As recently as the 70s it was controversial for women to wear pants. \n\nI don't know why men act like hardcore, blatant sexism is a thing of the past when men are still alive who could legally grope their female coworkers/employees and get away with it no-questions-asked.", "My friend was the only female articling student and was the only one assigned to bake cakes for the other lawyer\u2019s birthdays. \n\nThe 1950s sexism is still alive and well out there.", "Because it is.", "Just because something is true doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a shitty thing to say.", "Is it not sexist either way? You\u2019re saying what they\u2019re saying would be sexist if they were making it up\u2026why only if they were making it up? Have you considered they\u2019re clearly having these conversations in earshot of your partner? They sound gross.", "I don\u2019t understand why you are \u201cif\u201d\u2018ing this. \n\nThe coworkers said something sexist. There is no context where it isn\u2019t sexist. So why are you trying to come up with scenarios to defend them? Why are you taking the side of sexist men you don\u2019t k ow over your girlfriend?", "You are right. Obviously, something is going on, though, if she has only had 1 promotion in 3 different jobs, though.", "If I had an award to give you, I would. Thank you for saying this.", "So true.\n\n-- Woman in tech", "I would really like OP to answer this.", "I am not denying that she faces and has faced sexism at times. I just find it surprising that it would be to the extent she describes and I wonder if because she faces sexism she has a tendency to think that every unrelated obstacle is due to that.", "Because it doesn\u2019t directly affect them so they don\u2019t notice it and they all like to think they EARNED what they have. \n\nIt\u2019s all over OP\u2019s post and comments, he worked hard and is smart, that\u2019s why he\u2019s been successful. If only his girlfriend was as smart and capable as he is then she would succeed too \ud83d\ude44", "And that something could very well be sexism. It\u2019s common in the tech industry.", "You are denying them. You are denying them by acting like it\u2019s weird she has experienced it at every job just because the TWO women you worked with didn\u2019t. You\u2019re the one acting like TWO women out of thousands set the status quo. Maybe you should google and look at the countless interviews and studies on sexism in and out of the tech industry", "I felt the same way about racism until I took an entire college course about it. There is a lot that you can\u2019t see from the outside. Just cause you aren\u2019t a total jerk doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is the same way.", "Have you ever asked any of the women you work with about sexism in the industry? Rather than blithely assuming that somehow because you work with them it doesn\u2019t exist - I\u2019m not following your logic here. \nSexism in the tech industry is a hugely well known issue, so I\u2019m wondering quite how you\u2019ve missed it until now.", "You are so thick headed. Keep blaming women for sexism", "I feel so bad for her that she has to deal with sexism on all fronts - at work AND at home", "And it could very well be something else. Sexism is pretty common everywhere.", "I almost guarantee those 2 women have in the past and still experience it. They just don't talk about it because they don't want their accomplishments overshadowed by sexism. I would bet they have some stories that would turn OPs world upside-down.", "I am not saying that or comparing them and I don't know what those women faced earlier in their careers. Obviously when you have a phd from Berkeley and your name is on patents of products used everywhere in the industry people are going to respect you.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve had opposing counsel call me \u201cbaby.\u201d Sexism is a problem.", "How can you acknowledge how common sexism is everywhere and then turn around and say but it's probably not sexism?", "Don\u2019t you see the soft sexism in that though? A woman has to be highly accomplished to get respect. A man\u2026 not so much.", "Maybe you should get your head out of your butt and actually ask them what they went through. Just because you have a PhD from Berkeley doesn\u2019t mean people are going to respect you. You sound incredibly ignorant. \n\nMy college ex-boyfriend and I had the same degree. He told me I would amount to nothing and that if we were to stay together, i would need to give up my career aspirations cause he thought I would need to be at home with any kids we had.", "Consider that just because a woman has managed to work her way up to a good position, it doesn't mean that she hasn't faced sexism along the way. Simply saying that you have worked with very smart and accomplished women has relatively little bearing on whether those women have faced sexism or not. They got where they are despite sexism, not because there isn't any.", "That\u2019s an assumption that is not always true", "They\u2019re trying to minimize misogyny by pointing out that sexism happens to men too (without outright saying it), even though that isn\u2019t relevant to the conversation at all.", "That sounds awful I am sorry. Like do people just brazenly say things like amount to nothing to women?\n\nActually that is a good idea, I will speak to them and maybe get my gf to have a talk with them if she wants to.\n\nThat does surprise me, because when I see a PhD from Berkeley, CMU, Cambridge, Oxford etc I have an incredible amount of respect for that."]}
