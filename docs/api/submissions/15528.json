How can someone take on bigger projects if they\u2019re forced to hand them over to other members of staff and excluded from meetings regarding them? I\u2019ve heard stories like this from women hundreds of times, it\u2019s not at all unusual or uncommon.\n\nThis is unfortunately the norm for many male-dominated environments.

Yeah, bud, that\u2019s sexism. \n\nSo what HR didn\u2019t find anything? HR\u2019s job is the protect the company, not her.

I don't think so. I can imagine that makes her feel like they treat her as a secretary. Why aren't the men being asked to take notes? You need to wake up and start trying to see things from her perspective. As a man, you're not qualified to comment on what it's like to be a woman in the workplace and should listen more, comment less.", " The part of this that really makes me think you might be TA is where you say \u201cshe judges co workers for things they say that have nothing to do about work\u201d. \nWhy shouldn\u2019t she? I don\u2019t understand your logic here. Surely this is an example of the existence of subconscious sexism within the industry? Which you acknowledge exists? Realistically this will boil down to how you approached the conversation. There is a huge difference between \u201cyou need to work harder\u201d and \u201cprove them wrong and make a difference in the industry\u201d, however both essentially have the same outcome. Be supportive, accept the injustices she experiences.", "YTA\n\nI worked as a software consultant and got to the position where I was the lead for a department, I was one of 2 women and whenever I would set up meetings with companies (mostly male dominated companies) I would always be asked by the clients to make them a cup of tea or coffee whilst they got the meeting started, or if I could take notes to email them. \n\nAlways had to respond with, \u2018Can do, but the meeting doesn\u2019t start without me as I\u2019m your lead.\u2019 Or \u2018I can\u2019t lead the meeting and take comprehensive notes.\u2019\n\nMy two colleagues that worked with me were male and they always assumed they were the leads and I was the \u2018admin\u2019. I have a male sounding name so that would have been a confusion, but I always called to set up the meetings and introduced myself and my role. I\u2019d ask the questions and they would answer to my colleagues. \n\nSo yes, there is everyday sexism in workplaces that you do not see. You are blind to it because you don\u2019t know you\u2019re doing it (if you are) or you don\u2019t see it because it\u2019s normal to you. \n\nThe company I worked for were so so with the sexism. Yes I rose through the company to the lead position but it took a lot of proving myself, taking initiative and insisting that my projects not her handed over. Literally refusing to hand it over unless there was a good enough reason. I wouldn\u2019t accept weak reasons and had to be firm and vocal about knowing what I was doing. Me and a male colleague joined the company at the same time. I had more industry experience (4ish years) and this was his first ever job, I had to fight to get the salary I was paid (I wanted X, they offered Y which was much lower and I bargained for Z which was in the middle), my male colleague was offered the X I wanted with no bargaining. They never even asked him how much he wanted. Yes the hiring committee were male as well. \n\nMy partner refused to believe that there was so much sexism in the industry as well until I told him about the salary stuff above.

You and her both have the same amount of experience in the industry, and she graduated with a 4.0 and honors so obviously she knows what she's doing just as much as you do (if not more).\n\nShe is given projects that are then taken from her, not invited to meetings, invited to meetings to *take notes* (genuine question: have you ever been asked to take notes in a meeting? She isn't a secretary, she has the same qualifications as you.), and her coworkers say sexist things about their wives and girlfriends. It's bad enough that her *and another woman* made an official complaint to HR.\n\nYou seem to think your girlfriend is blaming sexism even though by your own recount of her work environment, sexism is an issue. Which is no surprise, because you work in a historically sexist industry. Instead of telling your girlfriend to work harder or suck it up, you should really try listening to her and providing support.", "If you're a man, maybe just listen to her and sympathize with being a woman in a male dominated field.

I have a CS/math degree and she has an electrical / electronics engineering degree.\n\nI have been promoted to a senior level at my company and she has been promoted only once and is still a junior at her company.\n\nShe always complains about how things are unfair at all jobs she had (3 so far) and how she is not given opportunities, supposedly excluded from meetings (while still claiming she gets asked to take notes in meetings) and decisions.She judges her coworkers for things they say that have nothing to do about work like when they talk about their wives and partners.\n\nShe and another woman once complained about a coworker for being rude in meetings and HR (which was dealt with by a woman) did not find anything wrong and dismissed their concerns.\n\nShe recently had a performance review and was not promoted and told that she needs to take on more challenges and told me that she does but is always told to hand over projects to other people when she starts them and excluded from the meetings.\n\nI do believe that there is some sexism in the industry but I think she cannot blame everything on sexism and recognize that perhaps she has room to improve. She thinks that because she graduated with honors with a 4.0 that translates to industry performance. Her degree is also in electronics and more hardware focused. I expressed this to her and suggested she follow her manager's advice to grow and she got upset with me and called me an AH. I get her disappointment but I don't think it is fair for her to expect me to just agree to everything she says.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No t \u2018challenge the ideas\u2019", "I had a boyfriend like you when I was working in a really sexist workplace at the start of my career. My manager completely overlooked my achievements and only acknowledged begrudgingly when I was the top performer and everyone in the team started to take notice.  I was not given challenging work, opportunities or anything even I had proven time and again I was good at it. I was young and didn't realize what I was up against. My boyfriend would dismiss my concerns. I started to doubt my own abilities.\n\nIt was only after I moved to a different company where my manager was supportive and encouraging that I was really able to spread my wings. And I had dumped by AH boyfriend by then. Sexism in the tech-industry is rampant. So many men are threatened by women doing well. \n\nNote-taking  as most people have mentioned is inherently sexist. Think pretty secretaries walking behind the big boss man taking notes!! and so many men in tech would love to bring back the good ol days.\n\nYou are chipping away at her self-worth by not acknowledging what she is going through. And no, she is not imagining it. Support her or get out the way. She needs a new job and a better partner.\n\nand if it wasnt clear yet YTA!", "Your edit sounds more like it. Remember that women can have internalized misogyny, so a woman brushing off sexism isn't that surprising. You wanna believe society is past that, and I get it.

I\u2019ve been invited to meetings to take notes, run presentations, and any time someone wants a office holiday party or get together it gets delegated to one of us women in office. I had a male coworker make very inappropriate sexualized comments to me, yet when I reported it to my supervisor & Dept head, they sent me to training for \u201chow to deal with difficult people\u201d. Some of the first questions I\u2019ve gotten asked when starting a new team include \u201cwhy\u201d I don\u2019t have kids yet, and comments about \u201cnot getting younger\u201d.

I said I\u2019m sorry but I need to get the meet started. He replied that I didn\u2019t look like what he expected from a manager. When I just stared at him he proceeded to explain to me that it was a compliment. Luckily the owner of the company was in the room and told the client he doesn\u2019t look like the kind of client we want so the meeting was canceled. Then he explained to the client it was a compliment. \n\nI was very lucky that our company owner was raised by a single mom and would not put up with this type of attitude from anyone but I\u2019ve worked for companies that would absolutely think this is acceptable.", "Your GF should break up with you.

I would just add, because I haven\u2019t seen this mentioned, HR exists to protect companies not employees.

Don\u2019t use HR not ruling in her favor as a sign that her complaints were unfounded.", "YTA\n\nThere are so many people who have explained to you, in fantastic detail, how sexist the world still is, and your conclusion is to look it up because you can\u2019t wrap your head around it.

And you really need to do some research.", "NTA but bro they're gonna tear you up and let you know it's all obviously against the woman here LMAO.", "There\u2019s sexism in every job I\u2019ve had. I own my own business now and I have had customers who \u201cwant to talk to the real boss\u201d or assume that the man I\u2019m standing next to is the owner or my superior. It\u2019s really frustrating. My brother never really listens when I tell him about it and always down plays it and it makes me feel bad about myself. I\u2019m sure your gf is looking for a sympathetic ear and you add further stress to her. Just listen to her and believe her. What does it do to you if you agree with her that it\u2019s frustrating instead of telling her it\u2019s her fault? Are you trying to help her succeed or are you trying to make her feel bad about herself? Sometimes your partner just wants to vent and doesn\u2019t want you to try and fix their problems.

I bet you'll start to notice things you brushed off as insignificant before. I experienced so much daily sexist stuff as a female engineer in Silicon Valley. But a lot of it is a blur now. What I remember most clearly is the day I was \"voluntold\" to take notes for the third meeting in a row and a respected male principle engineer looked up and said \"is she the only one with working fingers around here?\" I could have hugged that guy. If you've been promoted a few times, you could be that person for someone too.\n\nEta I just realized you said she was in EE. I was also a hardware engineer and it is real, real bad in HWE. You should believe her no matter her discipline but EE is extra awful for women.", "Things are going backwards. I wish men could disguise themselves as women and get a taste of it.

You owe her a huge apology.", "i hope you're single now lol", "Everyone has room to improve. But generally men are promoted on potential, women have to prove themselves over and over first.

Just because you haven\u2019t experienced something doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist. Why would your gf lie ?

She needs to document these incidents so she can defend herself at her review.", "YTA.  30+ years in software development here.

She doesn't need your skepticism, and she definitely doesn't need you piling on top of what the asshat tech bros already do at work.", "YTA. These things she talks about? Sexism. Think about this:\n\nDo men get invited to meetings to take notes, or do they get invited to participate? Sounds like she is telling you that she gets invited to the meetings not to participate, but to take notes. Women are apparently secretaries.\n\nDo projects men think up and try to spearhead to build their leadership skills get taken away? Probably not as often as it does for women. \n\nAre men rude to other men in meetings the way that they were to her and her other lady colleague? Probably not. The condescension is real.\n\nSexism isn't super blatant most of the time -- it's the little things that seem minor to men because it happens so infrequently to them that they don't see what the big deal is. These little things are so commonplace for women, especially in the tech world, that together, they signal to women that they are not wanted excepted to support men in taking notes or getting projects going to the man can take over.", "**AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA** \n\n^yta", "I am not denying that she is not smart.

Obviously sexist if they were saying those things if they are not true but there would be no way for her to know without knowing their partners.\n\nHer main complaint is that she is prohibited from doing work and projects she starts are taken over by others and then she is excluded from the meetings about them despite being willing to continue them.

And one day when he told me that he was thinking about leaving and did not want it to blindside me, and how he had complete faith in me to keep everything running, I laughed and made a nonchalant comment. I said, it wouldn't matter if I ran things very well, people would still credit you even if you were at another company, even if you were dead, people were more likely to say, hey look Joe's ghost is keeping things running instead of ever recognizing my efforts. \n\nMy manager was surprised and asked me what I meant. I told him that everything I do, he gets the credit even when he has nothing to do with it. People just assume he does it, it's like I don't exist. And then he finally started paying attention. Just the next day, he counted 5 instances where he was being thanked in front of me for work I had done. It didn't hit him until then. Then he noticed more things. How nobody listened to me even though I was the SME, that if I wanted someone to listen to me, I had to have him repeat exactly what I said and then people would agree. How the director said I had to prove myself before they would promote me even though I managed a senior engineer without twice my experience and I had the highest throughput of anybody in the team. How, whenever I flagged those issues, the director told me I had an attitude problem. Then he realized that I was not an angry person by default, it was because my workplace treated me as less than, like I didn't matter, like I wasn't even there.\n\nThe last thing my manager did before leaving was to push my promotion through.\n\nNow, I work in a FAANG. Of the 4 people on my team, the two women account for 87% of the output of the team. When we asked the manager, he said, women are better at multitasking, so you guys end up doing more. As if women are born with a multitasking manual. When we escalated it to his manager, he worked around it by having the women do the groundwork- the investigation, design, planning, architecture etc and then handed it over to the men - apparently because we were good at design and the guys were good at coding so this was playing to the team's strengths, never mind that my performance gets rated on the code I write,not the feature I design. And this way he gets to say that everyone did 1/4 of the teams output. When one of the men on the team, with 3 yrs of experience, told one of the women in the team with 16 yrs of experience that she didn't know what she was talking about and that he didn't have to listen to anything she says, the manager told her to have patience with people unwilling to learn and yet he told the disrespectful colleague that women would find him intimidating because of his words so to be careful. \n\nOh and btw, the other woman engineer and I both have Electrical engg backgrounds writing code for enterprise software that is literally in every computer. The guys on the team who account for 13% of the output even though their cumulative experience is the same as the women's cumulative experience? All CS graduates, including the manager. And I'll tell you this too - any engineer worth his salt knows that being a good engineer is agnostic of technology.

Continued to go to the two guys despite them being upfront with management that the other woman or I would be a more appropriate person to ask and both eventually gave up and would just ask us and bring them the answer and let them know that we told them. \n\nThey wouldn\u2019t listen to anything we said. They\u2019d hear what we advised and go to less experienced male coworkers and ask for a second opinion. They eventually started respecting the other girl a bit more when she started an engineering program, but still left her out of decisions she should have had a critical role in based on her specialized position- which was one that she was the only person certified and qualified to perform. In meetings (when they actually made an effort to include me) I would make suggestions based on years of experience, and they would ignore the info completely until a male coworker repeated it and then all of sudden it was a great idea. If I objected to a process or brought up that  something was a safety issue, or even asked for clarification on a process change or to be part of a meeting relevant to my role, I would get attitude from the manager (who was hired 3.5 years after me and had minimal experience hands on in the industry, btw. He had managed the schedules of people performing my job but couldn\u2019t operate a machine on his own) and he would snap at me for being difficult and to just do it because he decided it was happening. But he was happy to explain things in detail when asked to by a male coworker. And I would often be the one to catch up work that was behind or things that ended up getting messed up from his decisions, with very little recognition.\n\nThis stuff happens. And it happens a lot. And even by female HR reps, it goes unquestioned. My female HR rep pretty much ignored me when I brought up that I as a shift manager was being treated like I was incompetent compared to people with equivalent positions on other shifts who were less experienced, who\u2019s shifts had much lower productivity results than I did with my shift of 4 people across 2 departments compared to their 14 and 8, and happened to be male. If you are a woman working in a traditionally male dominated industry, you will undoubtedly notice that there are certain men that treat you like it\u2019s their mission to keep it male dominated. Prior to those 2 managers coming into the company I had one female and one male manager who were great, so it\u2019s not all men in these industries, and it\u2019s not all companies either, but one or two toxic ones can really make for a terrible work experience like your wife is going through. And just because HR brushed it off doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t happening. HR is a scam, they frame themselves to work for the employees benefit but they\u2019re really there to protect the company. They don\u2019t want to acknowledge things like this unless it gets too bad (i.e. too lawsuit worthy) to ignore.", "lol fuck off", "Yet again we have a person who is not discriminated against telling a person who IS discriminated against that it hasn't happened.\n\nYTA.", "So I've trained in the software, hardware, and support side of the industry (A+, Network+, degrees in electronic systems technogloy, multiple certifications for relevant skills like Telecommunications, soldering, circuit designs, troubleshooting circuits on a component level, etc.) and while my degrees aren't quite to her level YET, I can 1000% say that sexism especially on the side of the industry she went into is extremely prevalent.\n\nI've met so many people on all sides of the industry, and no matter where you look, it is there even from other women in the industry.

You only have to accidentally demoralise someone once to put them in a cycle of underperformance.\n\nYou can\u2019t believe it\u2019s so brazen, but generally it\u2019s actually not. It only takes one manager who is more picky and critical with women than with men and doesn\u2019t realise it to create an environment that makes it way harder for everyone to actually perform equally. It doesn\u2019t require that all the men in the workplace be leering sex pests, and that manager could just as easily be a woman as a man.
