For example, last Saturday she left her phone (with her credit card and driver's license in it) on the table while going to the grocery store. This meant that she had neither the grocery list, her phone, nor money with her. I was taking care of our son and noticed that she had left her things on the counter. Since the grocery store is just a 5 minute drive away and about 10-15 minutes by bus, I figured I should deliver her phone to her since we can't really afford to pay a driving ticket (for driving without a licence on her person), if it's at all possible to avoid, and that way she won't have to come back to get her card herself. Our son was drowsy so I put him in the crib and once I saw he was asleep I got on the bus and went over.\n\nAfter delivering the phone, my wife did not thank me, but rather asked whether our son was left unattended. I answered that I put him in the crib before leaving. She urged me to go back home but she was almost done with shopping and it would take longer to get back on the bus than to stay with her and drive back. She was not happy about this but decided not to make a scene at the grocery store. I tried to pick up some of the groceries on the list to help us get done faster, but that only resulted in an argument that made our shopping taking longer than expected.\n\nWhen we got back our son, he had woken up and was now standing in the center of the crib. This was exciting because he had never stood up by himself without someone else supporting him. We were both obviously excited and took lots of pictures, but my wife was surprisingly quiet and seemed moody. She then told me to go put the groceries away, which I did, but must have put the milk in the fridge precariously, because when she opened the fridge the milk carton fell out. It did not break, but my wife lost her shit, yelling at me for leaving the baby unattended and for possibly causing us to miss his first steps, and for not packing the groceries correctly, and for not being able to do anything right (her words, not mine).\n\nI worry that I am the asshole since my wife seemed very stressed out, but I'm also upset that she overreacted and yelled at me, and wasn't thankful that I saved her a trip home when she forgot her card.  \n", "created_utc": 1700591141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180noh9/aita_for_leaving_our_son_for_a_few_minutes_to/", "score": 607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because you put your child somewhere contained and safe, and they were sleeping at the time, and it's \"just a few minutes\".

Heck, growing up, my mother left my sister and me in cribs with a cat watching us, and went to the grocery store that was a 15 min drive away, and that wasn't a one off situation.\n\nBut there's also a need to look at a situation and go \"I have two choices in front of me, which is the better one to take\".

DON'T EVER EVER EVER leave a baby alone. Jesus. This story is a bit brutal but you could have had something like this happen in the short time you were gone.\n\nWhen I was in school, I had a friend who had terrible, severe burns all over his body and had both legs amputated as an infant. He was so badly burned, his teeth couldn't even grow in through his gums, so he had very few teeth. He had two prosthetic legs and one arm was basically melted to his abdomen so he couldn't use it very well. Not to mention, he was very shy and the way he looked profoundly affected his self esteem. Who knows how many more painful repercussions he had to deal with over the years from his mother making a really stupid, snap decision like yours. \n\nHis mother left him to go to the grocery store and guess what happened? The house caught on fire and there was nobody there to get him out. She came home to a burning house and couldn't get inside to get to her son. That poor baby nearly burned to death and had a lifetime of troubles because his mom decided to make a quick trip to the store without him. Because he was sleeping and she didn't want to wake him. Amazing how similar his story began to your lapse in judgement isn't it? Wouldn't you rather have had a simple ticket to deal with if something like this happened to your baby?\n\nIf I were your wife I would not be able to trust you to make sound decisions involving the well-being of your son.

To do something *that bad* you have to be absent from your duty to learn the most basic fundamentals about babies. For 10 months. It is proof of that parents absence in their duties.\n\n>I have no idea what you mean by this. What do you mean by \"who do you think neonatal medicine professionals see\"\n\nOf course you have no idea. Here are some definitions for you\n\n>Neonatal care is the type of care a baby born premature or sick receives in a neonatal unit.Units are a part of hospitals which provide care for babies soon after they are born. The word \u2018neonatal\u2019 means newborn, or the first 28 days of life.\n\nNew. Born. First 28 days. New. Neonatal professionals teach **new** parents. They don't know because they are **new**. This is the father of a 10 month old. Things having to be taught to *new* parents is *completely irrelevant* to this situation.\n\nThere is **no** reason to not know that level of basic shit after *10 months.* No way not to know other than completely neglecting your most basic non negotiable parenting duty to learn. The *only* way to not know something that fundamental after *10 months* is to not be actively parenting. Because parenting includes learning the things you need to know. Which he did not do.", "Why are you defending him when you already said YTA? Are you confused or something?", ">Right, but there are a lot of parents who are engaging in childcare but aren't attentive to the things that they should be. One instance of parental stupidity is not proof of parental absence.\n\n\nMy argument would be, this is not one instance of parental absence. If you were a present parent, you would be at least alerted to your baby not having consistent sleep cycles, starting to try to pull themselves up, putting non food items in their mouths, just generally getting into everything even at the crawling stage. \n\nThere is an alarming number of people who think kids just basically raise themselves, so you can just be on the phone or playing games or whatever and baby will magically evolve into a well-rounded human being. But, just because a parent is like that and *thinks* they're parenting, it doesn't make it true. OP might \"watch\" his baby 24/7, but is he really watching?", "No, they don't teach how to raise babies, that's too much. But the OBs I've worked with do go over how to put baby safely to sleep, basic hygiene and feeding needs, the car seat speech, the don't shake the baby speech, co-sleeping risks,  SIDS info, and general stuff to watch for that might warrant a doctor's visit.  I don't know if \"don't leave your baby unattended\" is part of the regular speech (probably not), but what they do cover, the implication is *you need to be careful with baby and watch them all the time*.", "YTA.

If my husband did this he\u2019d still be listening to me screaming at him. How dare you endanger your child that way. This was an incredibly stupid dangerous decision. You have a severe lack in judgement skills. Take your child with you when you leave the house.

He knows his wife won't call the cops on him because she's just as likely to get into trouble and see the kid land in foster care.  There are no witnesses.

When my kid was in preschool there was a kid with a that mom pulled this bs, left her infant in his crib while picking up other kid, 45-60 min *minimum*. She said 'god would protect him,' she couldn't seem to wrap her head around the fact that kids die when abandoned (you know OP, left unatended), god doesn't save them and her kid wasn't *special*. Not so long ago, 6 kids died in a fire when their mom went to the grocery store, bad shit happens when kids are without adult care.", "Yep. That was probably the single biggest takeaway from when I visited after my niece was born (first baby of the next generation). She was 2 months old (I'd held back on visiting to let the grandmas have first visit rights and not overwhelm my brother and SIL with guests) and even as the Third Backup Adult in the house it was stressful knowing that there always, always, at all times needed to be at least one on-duty adult. Even when she was sleeping or just hanging out in the swing or something. Someone had to keep an eye on her just in case.\n\nAnd that was with a 2-month-old, well before the stage of being self-motile. A 10-month old, though, is moving around and interacting with shit and able to get into So Much Trouble so quickly.

Boys weren't taught those things in the 1950s. It was unmanly,, you see. \n\nCloser to modern times, my grandson's stepmother wouldn't give him a needle and thread to sew on a button, because \"he might hurt himself.\" He was 12. *Twelve!*  I taught him to sew at 5, when he made a baby quilt for his auntie's upcoming baby.  \n\nI understand Impatience when a child who is helping takes 3 times as long to do a task, but you shut it down and let the child learn!", "\ud83d\ude06", "She would get in trouble as well for not leaving immediately when she found out the baby was indeed alone ....", "For me it was my TSH value that flagged out of normal range.
