Most troubling of all, he's brought dangerous people into our home and they've threatened us. He broke into our house while I was home alone, and I was extremely scared. He started shouting and cursing at me, which led to my first panic attack. I felt terrified and my body started shaking uncontrollably.

There is never a time or a place in this world where it is acceptable to cause harm to others, in any way, shape or form.\n\nI am sorry you had to go through that, on your won but you handled it really well. Keep calling the cops, so they can build a case. All the way down the line, your cousin has options to change his ways but if he doesn't, the prison system will sort it out for him.
