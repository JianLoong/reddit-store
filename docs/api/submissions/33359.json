My step-mom picked her and my dad\u2019s grandparent names before we were even pregnant and my in-laws picked their names within the first month of my baby being born. \n\nMy mom and step-dad haven\u2019t picked their names. My mom has a weird idea that the baby can\u2019t have two people called Grandma but needs to have at least one person called Grandma. Well my mother-in-law decided to be Grandma so my mom wants to be called something else but she hasn\u2019t picked a name yet. My baby is almost three months old now. He recognizes people and smiles when they interact with him. \n\nI ask my mom every few weeks if she picked a name but she keeps deflecting. My husband and I are getting annoyed as we just want to know what to call her when we are talking with the baby about who is coming over or who we are going to see.\n\nMy mom works in a school but with a difficult to pronounce name, she just has the kids call her Mrs. M. Would I be the asshole for calling her Mrs. M to my baby since she won\u2019t pick a grandparent name?\n\nEdit: I have given my mom multiple name options (Nana, Nonna, Lulu, Oma, Mimi, Grammy, etc) she shoots all of them for various reasons. She refuses to be called Grandma M because my MIL is already going to be Grandma. My mom doesn\u2019t want to wind up being referred to as \u201cthe other Grandma\u201d\n\nI\u2019m seriously stuck since she hadn\u2019t like any of the grandparent names I\u2019ve found/come up with. That\u2019s why my husband and I have said if she doesn\u2019t pick one herself, we\u2019ll call her Mrs. M. \n\nEdit 2: For those saying my mom hasn\u2019t had enough time to form her new identity name, I initially told her two years when we started trying to conceive that she should consider what her grandparent name would be. I brought it up again when found out I was pregnant. And reminded her throughout the pregnancy that the \u201cdeadline\u201d was approaching. And now it\u2019s been almost 3 months after his birth and she still hasn\u2019t picked a name but gives me all the excuses on why names I offer won\u2019t work ", "created_utc": 1702995204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m2tud/aita_for_having_my_baby_call_my_mom_by_her_work/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grandma K and Grandma S where the letters were the first initial of their last names.  The initials were dropped when only one of them was present.\n\nGrandma is a title.  Your mother is a grandma.  It\u2019s how we teach our kids and everyone else where the family fits in the family tree.  Uncle and Aunts are restricted to just one person, so why would grandma and grandpa be??", "This is fuckin stupid. Since when can't you have 2 grandma's??", "... What? \n\nSeriously? What is this? \n\nThis seems like a \"mountain out of a mole hill\" situation. I just can't figure out who is seeing the mountain and who recognizes it's a mole hill. \n\nSomeone pick a nickname, or the kid will based on what they hear being said around your Mom. \n\nI have no idea what your mom's thoughts are. Maybe she is afraid of getting old. Maybe she really wanted to be \"Grandma\" and was upset that someone else called dibs on it. Maybe she thinks the other nicknames are too cold (Grandmother M) or too silly. I don't know. \n\nMaybe she's worried about being second best to other grandparents, I have no idea. \n\nI don't remember when I started calling my Grandma (mom's mom) by that name, but I remember that I was instructed by my mom to call my dad's mom \"Abuelita\". It's a softer version of \"Abuela\" which means \"Grandmother\". I didn't know why until about a decade after she died, that it was because her other DILs (she had all sons) all titled her \"Abuela\" while their own mothers got to wear the \"Abuelita\" crown. They were cold towards my Abuelita, and encouraged their children to be more friendly with their mothers and ignore as much as possible their husbands' mother. \n\nSo, my mom decided that since we weren't using \"Abuelita\", that her MIL could be the one to hold that crown in our house. And it made my Abuelita happy. She wasn't happy about a lot of things, but she was happy about that. It gave her comfort towards the end of her life, since my father is her youngest son, and we were her youngest grandchildren. \n\nIt's crazy how a name can change someone's whole personality. I remember her as the sweet woman who gave me money for candy, and fed me cookies and milk after church when we visited, and told me stories of her home country. Meanwhile, my cousins remember her as a cold and distant and harsh woman. Was it the name? Or did she mellow with age? \n\nI don't know. But it's an interesting coincidence.", "This is so weird. Just call her Grandma M until she picks.\n\nI don't even know why people need special names, or why they both can't be grandma. I called all of my grandparents grandma and grandpa, and if they were in the same room or it would otherwise be unclear who I was referring to, I just called them Grandpa/Grandma followed by their first name. No problems.", "My grandparents must\u2019ve not had their grandparent names picked out so I called them Grandma/Grandpa Mom\u2019sLastName and Grandma/Grandpa Dad\u2019sLastName. No confusion. When we were together I would just say Grandma or Grandpa. Not that confusing. If you want to call her something just call her Grandma M not Ms. M. She can always modify that in a small window. I did have one set of grandparents decide they wanted to be called Meemaw and PopPop when I was 16, and I laughed so hard.", "YTA. \n\nYou wanna call her Mrs. M? When she\u2019s the baby\u2019s grandparent?\n\nRight now your kid is literally 3 months old. There\u2019s still plenty of time to pick a nickname.", "I would go with \"Grandma M\". Before I named my grandparents (yup) they were referred to as Grandma and Grandpa Lastname. Since that last name won't work, the initial should be fine.\n\nIf you go with this \u2b06\ufe0f (the default name) you won't be TA.\n\nAlready NTA for asking, though. Your mom is being unduly difficult.", "ESH\n\nThat's something you pick? If it's not a language or regional thing, you're talking nicknames but also title. They're picking their own nickname title???\n\nLet the kid pick or use language. My kids have grandma [name] and grandpa [name] on one side and grandma [name] and grandpa [name] on the other. In a English speaking area with no regionalisms, how is that not the default?", "YTA, call her grandma til she chooses a name.", "YTA / YWBTA\n\nShe wants her own identity as a grandmother. Many grandparents want that. Telling the child to call her \u201cMrs. M,\u201d simply because she isn\u2019t making the decision quickly enough for you, who won\u2019t be called by the name, is asshole behavior.", "Just call her \"Grandmother\" until she picks something else like Gigi.  She probably wont like the formality of it and will offer something else or be stuck with it.", "As children get older, they will develop their own nicknames as well based on what they can pronounce. Your child is way too young to be stressing about this right now. I\u2019m not going to call you TA but you do need to relax.", "lol tell me you\u2019re a first time parent without telling me.\n\nSo much drama over nothing. Your kid will ultimately decide what to call them.", "YWBTA if you start calling your mom Mrs. M as a way to give her an identity to your baby. He is not one of the kids from her school. There is plenty of time for a name to develop, and the child really determines the nickname in the end. \n\nSince the last name is M, why not Mimi?", "NTA, if she can't decide yet, decide for her and then change it if/when she picks something else. But Mrs M is too formal/impersonal for her grandchild. Most adults in school are referred to as Mr. Blank or Mrs. Blank, but it's a workplace, and it's respectful for students to refer that way. Mrs. M is like your child using your first name to call you instead of saying mum. Grandparents usually want something more endearing.", "You are getting a lot of good suggestions here! We had Grammy, Nanny and Grandma. Grandma was our great-grandmother.", "You got at least a year to figure that out. NTA but it nothing to stress over", "Don\u2019t call her Mrs anything to the baby. If she won\u2019t pick one of the nicknames, then just refer to her as grandma M for now. At 3 months, the baby is not differentiating names. They are learning voices but will not be able to receptively identify a person by name until at least 9 months. And even then it won\u2019t be consistent. You won\u2019t know for sure what that baby will name her until at least a year or 18 months, when they literally use a word for them for the first time. Besides which, there\u2019s a reason babies name their parents easy things to say, like \u201cmama\u201d and \u201cdada\u201d, because those are early developing sounds. So grandma won\u2019t be fully easy to say at 1-2 (for some kids even older) which is also the historical reason many have gone with nana or Mimi. \n\nRegardless a baby often chooses their own names for close people and things. Just relax and call her grandma to the baby until one of them tells you otherwise. That baby is not recognizing you saying anyone\u2019s name right now and certainly doesn\u2019t have the object permanence to know who you\u2019re referring to when she isn\u2019t even there. \n\n(Source: speech language pathologist and grandma/nana/popo/abuela/who knows to 5 month old baby who will eventually call me something but also doesn\u2019t know I exist until he sees me)", "Yta. Yall know the baby can't talk, and really cannot understand folks names at this point,right? Why not just go with a mimi or Nana or something, and ask her directly  what she thinks of it.

He can't talk yet.  And what's wrong with 2 grandmas?  I had Grandma Sue and Grandma Mary.\n\nTell her 'if you don't tell me your preference, I'll be calling you Grandma First Name to the baby.

You need to let her come up with it or let the baby come up with it when baby is really old enough to understand about grandparents. Your child is only 3 months of age. And just for context and an example, I had a particular Grandma name that I wanted to use because I like the way it sounded and because part of my heritage is French from what I was told growing up and I thought it would be cool to have that particular moniker for Grandma instead of grandma. 2 years in and my granddaughter still didn't pick up on it so one day out of the blue after her brother was born I decided to try a moniker I gave my mom's mother, mom mom and it took off. From that day forward I was my mom and to this day 11 years later almost 12:00 I've been going by the moniker my mom. And this took two years to find what worked with my grandkids. Even my grandson calls me mama. I am so proud today to have that moniker because not only did I use it for my own grandmother but now it's carried on through my kids children as well. My son has not had any kids of his own and he really doesn't want to have any but believe you me if he ever does any of his kids would be calling me my mom as well. I really again wouldn't push it too much your child is only 3 months old and when your child is old enough to distinguishing between the grandparents maybe your child will come up with something unique for your mother Mrs m is so cliche. That's what kids in school call their teachers sometimes. Or maybe their friend's parents. And if you want to use mom mom suggest it to your mom. And let me know I would love to find out if she used it or not. It's very unique. I've not really ever heard of anyone else using it in my area where I live. So maybe try that and see what she says.

She worked as a dispatch at a huge truck stop and her handle was Lady Bug. To this day, he and all her grandkids call her Bug lol stop stressing over it. The baby is 3 months old and won't remember anything she is told now anyways. Wait til she is older and if your mom hasn't picked a name, just call her grandma.
