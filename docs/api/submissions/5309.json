They've been together since high school. \n\nAshley and I do not get along. I find her to be lazy, useless, not the best mom, she's supercatty and her voice annoys me. She doesn't like me because I don't kowtow to her and I am very direct with Max. We largely avoid each other and that's fine.\n\nAshley and Max gave up good jobs to launch a business that failed epically. Long story. They both thought that they'd end up working a few hours a day and become millionaires. \n\nSince they both had to go back to work, they needed a sitter for their 4 (yes, 4) son's who are 5, 7, 9 and 13. It didn't make financial sense to get a sitter and have half your earnings pay for one.\n\nI'm just a single guy who works fully remotely and I love my nephews so I offered to watch them for free. Sometimes I have them more than their parents. I don't really feel the extra costs of having them around. I just think it's cool that they will grow up having their uncle as their sitter.\n\nI started butting heads with Ashley over her trying to micromanage me from her job. I don't do micromanage. I do things my way. When those boys get picked up, they get picked up with a full stomach,  homework done, all their boy energy gone and clean. I'm obviously doing an excellent job. I don't need direction. I'm with the boys, she is not.\n\nMax tried to intervene by asking me to \"work\" with her. I asked him to name me one thing that I need to work on. I'll wait.\n\nI was blunt with him and said this is a control issue and that's not going to \"work\" but I will sleep on it.\n\nThe next day I said in order for this to work, then I need to work for her. Therefore I want $19 an hour and since I don't like her, I also want to be reimbursed for gas and food. \n\nHe told me to be serious and I said I was. He said I know they can't afford a sitter. I said if he wants a free sitter then tell your wife to not to bother me unless it's an emergency.  I'll deal with him instead. \n\nThe funniest part is he is more controlling with his kids than she is. He still dresses the three younger kids and sleeps with them.\n\nEdit: The last fight was over when they do their homework. She asked that they come straight home or to my place and start in homework because it's a battle with them.\n\nI said no. I'm going to let them burn themselves out on the school playground and then bring them home to do homework. I have never had an issue with homework like she has. She's just lazy and controlling.  \n\nThen she'll text me at 3:15pm and \"reminds\" to bring them home.

If he was doing a shitty job, they can happily figure out another way to get childcare.  \n\nSo, worst case scenario, he is giving them pop tarts and cherry coke for dinner.

And yes, you can do someone a favour and still treat them terribly. \n\nBut OP is a massive AH because at every turn both in the post and comments he's clearly trying to present himself not just as a good caregiver but as a BETTER PARENT than the kids' own parents (who have far fewer resources than he does); is acting offended that their actual parent feels a right to have input into how her children are taken care of; makes snide remarks about parents who it seems to me are just doing the best they can with what they have (\"sometimes I have them more than their parents do...\" And? That's sad and difficult for their parents I'm sure, not some sort of statement of triumph for their uncle-babysitter); and just generally comes off as pretentious and completely lacking in empathy.

It's skilled, difficult, vitally important work and should be compensated as such.", "I mean, the problem is, it seems they made A LOT of poor financial decisions that they are now dealing wtih the consequences of.  If he provides them better food, that is definitely a fair thing to discuss.", "This whole post feels like he's trying to shit on their finances.", "Well, for me, the \"I don't like her voice\" is one of those things where after a certain point, anything someone does annoys you.  Was it necessary to the story?  No.  Does it paint a better picture of the relationship?  Absolutely. \n\nThis sounds like 2 people with a severe dislike for each other, but one of them (SIL) is also using the other for free labor.

Yes they made a bad financial decision and are now not doing great which is why he\u2019s babysitting for free and why I ultimately vote NTA. The food thing?
