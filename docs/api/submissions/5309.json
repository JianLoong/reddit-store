She doesn't like me because I don't kowtow to her and I am very direct with Max. We largely avoid each other and that's fine.\n\nAshley and Max gave up good jobs to launch a business that failed epically. Long story.

It didn't make financial sense to get a sitter and have half your earnings pay for one.\n\nI'm just a single guy who works fully remotely and I love my nephews so I offered to watch them for free. Sometimes I have them more than their parents. I don't really feel the extra costs of having them around. I just think it's cool that they will grow up having their uncle as their sitter.\n\nI started butting heads with Ashley over her trying to micromanage me from her job. I don't do micromanage. I do things my way. When those boys get picked up, they get picked up with a full stomach,  homework done, all their boy energy gone and clean. I'm obviously doing an excellent job.

Therefore I want $19 an hour and since I don't like her, I also want to be reimbursed for gas and food. \n\nHe told me to be serious and I said I was. He said I know they can't afford a sitter. I said if he wants a free sitter then tell your wife to not to bother me unless it's an emergency.  I'll deal with him instead. \n\nThe funniest part is he is more controlling with his kids than she is. He still dresses the three younger kids and sleeps with them.\n\nEdit: The last fight was over when they do their homework. She asked that they come straight home or to my place and start in homework because it's a battle with them.\n\nI said no. I'm going to let them burn themselves out on the school playground and then bring them home to do homework. I have never had an issue with homework like she has. She's just lazy and controlling.  \n\nThen she'll text me at 3:15pm and \"reminds\" to bring them home.

It's skilled, difficult, vitally important work and should be compensated as such.", "I mean, the problem is, it seems they made A LOT of poor financial decisions that they are now dealing wtih the consequences of.
