Don't go out with her because she will probably do that shit again.\n\nI was in a situation where a dude would say \"we should hang out later\" then ignore me for a day or two, then message me being super interested in me again. Turned out he had another girl the whole time!\n\nAll those times I altered my plans for the day thinking we would hang out (and we DID hang out and hook up many other times) only to be ignored was so hurtful and frustrating.

It\u2019s time to move on from her. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s not invested in this relationship/friendship as much as you are. Also, here she tried to act smart. Why did she say are we going to the movies the next day when she had no plans of actually going. She wanted you to say \u201cit\u2019s okay, some other time\u201d She did that so that she can later say oh! I did text and wanted to meet. This is manipulative behaviour.

She was wrong, and it's as simple as that.  I'd be just as irritated were I in your situation.

What did you expect when you made that snarky comment? That everything would be rosy and that all would be well? Did it also ever cross your mind...*she may have honestly forgotten your plans until you messaged her at 8PM?* And if this was something you planned with her, why didn't you message her long before she messaged you asking if you were still going?

Is this the same woman you\u2019ve been after since February? Cause if so I have a feeling she\u2019s trying to keep her distance without telling you to leave her alone. This comes off as you just feel entitled to her time because\nif she\u2019s just someone you talk to and she forgot your plans I don\u2019t understand why the response is to get angry.

You really did dodge one!!", "I get the irritation, but the point I'm making is that the snark was best left on the table. Instead of responding like that, you could have said, \"well maybe tonight isn't a good night then. Let me know when you're free and we'll try again then.\"\n\nI can PROMISE you that you would have had a completely different reaction. Now, she probably thinks you're a dick and wants nothing to do with you. She still sucks though for slamming the door on communication until the very last minute though.", "Fair enough, but as I said...it doesn't change my verdict.

You deserve better than this flakey date.", "Respectfully I disagree. A conversation would have been a much more appropriate way to resolve that. The point that I was making is we don't know if this was plans she made with her friend that conflicted with the plans with OP and she felt awkward and thus didn't tell OP as a result. SHOULD she? Yes. I'm not denying that she was in the wrong here too. But I really don't think that this was a situation where being snarky was necessary. This could have been just a bump in an early relationship that...needed ironing out. Now, the door's been slammed.", "lol why did you even engage an argument with someone who\u2019s essentially a stranger? She didn\u2019t care about the plans she made with you or your time.

It may be different if she reached out and apologized and gave a reasonable excuse, but the audacity to not respond and then try to assume that the plans are still on?", "NTA.

Im always talking to someone haha. But no, THAT ended in an epic fashion that deserves its own post one day. Just too lazy rn.", "In all candor it should be the last. \n\nNTA", "Her plans with OP were from the day before! She doesn't respond at all the day of the planned date and then the _next_ day she says \"so, hey what about that movie?\" and then can't make it that night either?\n\nCome on. If I have plans with someone and they don't respond to me at all day of, and then completely skip over the fact that they blew me off next time they text me? That's not any kind of relationship worth saving."]}
