When you\u2019re estranged from living family, you usually have some agency. You\u2019ve made that decision. \u201cOrphan\u201d is a completely different situation outside of your control.

They don't understand that it was your mother who ended the relationship... With a child. \n\nAsking about family is such a common question from new people and it would be painful to explain a complicated history like that to every new person and many vague answers might encourage others to prove deeper (many people without traumatic upbringings can't fathom that a parent would abandon their child).\n\nI think you should consider something clear, neutral, and which conveys a disinterest in talking further. \n\n\"I've been on my own since my father passed away, but thankfully I've built up a great chosen-family that supports me now\"", "NTA.\n\nYour friends shitting on you are not really your friends.
