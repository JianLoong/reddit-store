Now if his dad were dead and he went through the same situation with his mom I would agree with you.", "Because it's a straight up lie and belittles actual orphans.", "Given these circumstances, it seems pretty reasonable to me for you to say you don't have parents.", "I understand that this is obviously personal to you  but your trauma doesn\u2019t mean not to empathize. You are allowed to have feelings about it but you don\u2019t have to be a dick to someone who obviously isn\u2019t a malicious AH on this sub.", "That\u2019s your opinion and since this is about (ridiculous) semantics, he was not an orphan when he was 0-17. He was an orphan after 17, which is now. He is an orphan, he was orphaned at 17.", "It really doesn\u2019t.", "Tell that to a kid who didn't grow up with a parent. OP had one until 17. That's all he has to say. He sounds like he wants sympathy."]}
