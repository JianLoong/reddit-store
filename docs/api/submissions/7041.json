She doesn't even offer to share. \nBut that is not my issue with this. \n\nWe have water, lime water, tea, coffee and sparkling water to drink. And i think it impolite not just to drink what you are offered as a guest. \n\nI dont buy soda for everyday meals, but would buy it if i invited guests over for a birthday or some other celebration. And I dont think guest should require soda for meals on a Tuesday evening. And I feel it is kind of offensive that she feel the need to bring her own soda. \n\nWIBTA if I told her how i feel? \n\nWhen we visit MIL she never offers water with the food. Every meal is served with soda and beer, sometimes wine. I dont bring my own water even though i would prefer water with my meal. I drink some soda.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the judgement. I'm TA and will not bring it up to her. \n\nI do however feel there may be some cultural differences here. Where I'm from soda is not a normal everyday drink. As a child I was allowed soda maybe 6-7 times a year like for Christmas and birthdays. Today it's normaly served to children and adults who don't drink alcohol when others would get beer or wine. And I would feel the same if a guest brought beer or wine for themselves to dinner on a weekday. That's why I don't feel like serving it on a Tuesday and I still feel like her bringing her own soda is implying that I should be serving soda. Which makes me feel like a bad host. But you all right it does not hurt anyone that she wants soda and bring her own. \n\nSome of you seem to think this is about health, it is not. I'm not concerned for her health. \n\nI dont want to control what she drinks, but I did want to tell her, that she made me feel not good enough. But thanks to you all I will just swallow that feeling and avoid talking about the issue. \n\nAlso some of you asked about children - there are no children involved in this.", "created_utc": 1673423519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108z557/wibta_if_i_tell_mil_not_to_bring_soda_when_she/", "score": 4693, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Apparently MIL hasn\u2019t complained about it\u2026she just brings her own. When you go to her place, why do you feel unable to ask for a glass of water? You\u2019re family. Going to say that YTA here, but lightly.", ">I don't think guest should require soda for meals on a Tuesday evening.\n\nIt's soda, not a handle of vodka.\n\nShe's allowed to bring her own beverages, and drink them. I bring my own tea and water everywhere.\n\nAlso, you are a poor host if your guests don't have good refreshment options-especially if you know your guests preferences. \n\nYou're allowed to have ridiculous rules in your house about what people drink- but you must know that it IS ridiculous to forbid someone drinking some soda with dinner.\n\nYTA", "YTA, maybe it\u2019s just me but if someone I care about loves soda, and they even go as far as bringing it to respect the fact that we don\u2019t stock our fridge with soda, i would be grateful! And if I didn\u2019t mind having soda in the fridge, I would make sure to stock some for them since I\u2019m the host. It\u2019s just mindful hosting.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re pissed about it is red flags. Why does it trigger you that she brings her own drink when you won\u2019t provide it yourself? Genuinely curious if there\u2019s more to this.", "YTA. Please for the love of god get a grip on your main character syndrome. It\u2019s not some personal affront to you that she likes to drink soda at dinner. \n\nAnd honestly since you know she likes to drink soda at dinner and instead of just buying some for her to have when she\u2019s over there you\u2019ve decided to die on the \u201cI won\u2019t buy soda but also you can\u2019t bring your own\u201d hill so you\u2019re double the asshole. \n\nThis is an issue entirely of your own creation and it only lives inside your mind, not the real world.\n\nPlease get a grip. Your MIL is an adult woman who can choose what she wants to drink at any given time without your approval.", "YTA So she doesn\u2019t like your drink options and isn\u2019t expecting you to make a special purchase just for her.

This is weird and feels like it\u2019s coming from a place of judgement. So what if she likes soda. How does that impact your life? Let the woman drink her soda. You said yourself that you don\u2019t keep soda at your place. So, she brings her own. What\u2019s the big deal? Why do you feel compelled to control what she drinks?

Of your list of available drinks I will only drink one (water). I like soda, it's my preference, but if the dinner fits I'd also eat with a nice white or red. Sometimes I'll even take hot chocolate so I have something to drink that is hot while everyone else has their after dinner coffees.\n\nMost of my friends/family that host will provide some other option for me, or will ask the guests if they have preferences, otherwise they don't have a problem with me bringing my own. I don't have a problem with just water, but it always feels a little weird to be sitting there with a glass of water while everyone else is drinking coffee.\n\nIt takes nothing for you to accommodate her drink choice. Literally nothing since she's bringing it. If you don't want her to act like you're being a bad host, maybe provide things your guests will drink?

Maybe if my kids were older and were going to want some for themselves every time.\n\nHave you ever asked for a glass of water or helped yourself to one at their house?\n\nThis whole question is just weird, sounds like you don't like your MIL and are looking for things to complain about.", "I dont think its your place to decide what she drinks when she buys it herself, im diabetic and often bring my own drinks to social gatherings and family events.

Also, therapy for controll issues wouldnt be a bad thing.", " YTA this is weird, why are you offended? It\u2019s a drink, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s snubbing something you\u2019ve made for a shop bought version, she just has a drink preference like most people", "I bring a 12 pack of sparkling water with me in my car whenever I go to a person's house. It's not a knock against them. I just like to drink it", "YTA.    You don't even like soda!  If your MIL isn't a total moron, then she knows that!

Some folks just enjoy making up things to complain about, sheesh!", "Wow. So what you're saying is, \"I don't think this grown woman should make her own decisions about what she drinks with her dinner\"\n\nOf course YTA", "YTA\n\nShe likes soda,. If you do not want her to bring her own then provide what she wants. \n\nIf you want bottled water at her house feel free to bring some.", "Some people LOVE soda the way coffee people LOVE coffee.

Plus this isn't a guest you're having over once but a family member you seemingly have over often. It's actually kinda rude you're not more accommodating.\n\nAnd good lord, you're an adult. If you want water with your dinner, ask! If they don't have filtered water, bring your own.", "YTA  She knows you don't buy soda and apparently that's her preference.

Be an adult.", "YWBTA if you tell her not to bring soda.\n\nLet her live her life \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this is really a strange thing to get bothered by, also, you can bring your own water / tea when you visit her", "You would be the asshole, honestly. \n\nThis isn't being done to in a rude way. She just likes soda with dinner, and she knows you don't keep soda at the house, so rather than ask you to get some, she just brings her own without making a fuss. \n\nI think she'd be more than understanding if you brought your own water or seltzer waters to her house. \n\nThis is the type of petty nonsense stuff that makes the world and society as a whole more uncomfortable to live in than it ought to be. If we could all just practice being more laid back, and practice acceptance and appreciation for the quirks of the people in our lives, we'd be able to spread more positive energy and love to everyone in our lives. \n\nIt's a beautiful thing that you and your family members get together to have dinner and the opportunity to create stronger bonds and warm happy memories. The good days don't last forever - life happens, people grow old and pass away, and so many other families don't have the ability to feed more than just their own household or have get-togethers.", "YTA. Why do you care that your MIL wants to have her preferred drink with a meal? You said you don\u2019t keep soda in your home, she noticed that and brings her own rather than expecting you to stock it for when she comes over. \n\nWhy is it impolite to bring over drinks to a dinner gathering? If she brought a bottle of wine or case of beer for the gathering would you feel the same way?", "YTA sorry.   Your MIL has a thing for soda.  Sounds harmless to me.   Knowing that she loves soda (and its dirt cheap) you could provide it for her when she comes visiting.  When you visit her all you have to do to get water (I would hope) is ask.", "YTA. You don\u2019t offer her preferred drink so she just brings it instead of asking you to buy it. \n\nThe thing about you drinking soda at her house is just weird if you prefer water. Just ask for a water instead of being a martyr about it.", "YTA", "YWBTA. It\u2019s quite literally a non issue, based entirely on your feelings. Examine why it annoys you, could be quite beneficial to your long term growth.", "YWBTA. She's bringing her chosen drink for herself because she knows you normally don't serve it. How does that offend you? You even do provide soda to guests for celebrations so it's not like you're a soda-free home. \n\nAnd btw, you should be willing to ask for water or bring your own when you go to her home. You don't need to drink soda if you don't want it. SMH", "Yta, my aunt, takes diet coke everywhere. She doesn\u2019t expect someone else to provide her preferred drink.

We do usually bring enough to share though lol.", "Yta\n\nWhy don\u2019t you just buy a few bottles of soda, put them in a cupboard and then pop in the fridge when you know she\u2019s coming? Then you can offer it to her, she clearly likes it so why don\u2019t you have some in stock?", "YTA\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with providing yourself with what you want.

It\u2019s so easy.", "YTA. She is an adult and can drink what she wants, you don\u2019t need to micromanage her fluid intake. If you want water at her house, take it. But really, if you know she likes it, how hard is it to have some on hand for her if you are bothered she isn\u2019t drinking what you offered? I keep a few of all my family members/close friends favorite drinks on hand for when they visit. If it\u2019s just that she is drinking something you didn\u2019t offer and know she always drinks it, then have it. Then she\u2019s not offending you by bringing her own beverage.

It is nice of her to bring soda if that\u2019s what she wants instead of expecting you to buy it for her.\n\nFlip the scenario, if you went to eat at her place and all she offered was soda as a guest does that mean you have to drink soda?

It's okay to talk as long as you're not immediately combative. However, keep in mind that if she wants to bring soda, it doesn't affect anyone except herself.

A good host tries to make their guests comfortable, not dictate an adult woman\u2019s life choices.  \n\nAlso, just ask for a glass of water at her house! You\u2019re over thinking this and taking offense for no reason what so ever\u2026", "My husband and I only drink black coffee but I always keep a box of those individual creamers on hand for company. It's called being a good host, something the OP doesn't grasp.", "Smoke and a pancake? Cigar and a waffle? No?  Pipe and a crepe?", "Gosh darn it Barb! I've had this conversation with you MANY times. Soda at dinner is a Friday night occasion. Just because you're a sodaholic doesn't excuse you bringing soda to brunch on a Wednesday!", "I thought to add that just after I hit \"post\".  Amen!", "YEP! This right here. My sister and I regularly say to her boyfriend \u201cam I really a guest\u201d when I\u2019m over, LOL.", "Yeah, when I\u2019m at my sister\u2019s house I literally just get my water myself. One time her boyfriend offered me some before I had gotten myself a glass and I was like \u201cI\u2019m fine for now and I\u2019m v comfortable here so don\u2019t worry, I would 100% get it if I wanted it \ud83d\ude02\u201d (he has some line about being a good Jewish host and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s *really* a thing but my sister is going to convert and he\u2019s trying to train her to be a good Jewish hostess, but I\u2019m kinda like \u201cam I really a guest? I\u2019m her kid sister\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02)", "I will maybe have a glass of soda two times a month and still feel a bit guilty about how unhealthy it is. I can't imagine drinking several a day. I think I'd be very hard not to be  overweight if I did that.", "OP said MIL\u2019s actions make her feel like she\u2019s a bad host\u2026when she actually *is* a bad host. I cannot even imagine this level of petty/resentment towards anyone never mind my partner\u2019s family. \n\nI have family/friends who are gluten free and alcohol free, so I keep par-baked gluten free baguettes in my freezer and non alcoholic wines or sparkling cider on hand in the event of an impromptu visit.  You really only need to visit me once and I\u2019ll be sure to have alternatives on hands for the next time and keep trying to find really good products that we can genuinely enjoy together. \n\nIt\u2019s a fun challenge IMO, not even the least bit annoying. In fact, I learned oat flour is much better for thickening sauces than plain flour and have used it since. Makes for better pancakes too.", "That's what I was thinking. She knows MIL likes soda, why not score some points with her by buying her some?", "Using it like pedialyte makes much more sense. I guess the way it was marketed, as an American just visiting, I assumed it was more like gatorade which is something I usually also want if I'm hungover but it's less sweet. The most sugary beverage I've ever had was this watermelon soda from south america (not sure which country because I got it at a restaurant here in Florida) that tasted like straight cavities.", "Same here! I have in-laws who like to drink beer and ice tea. Those aren't our beverages of choice at home, but seeing that they like to drink them or have asked in the past when I didn't have any, now I just keep some around or buy either/both if I know they'll be coming over. It's one thing if it's the first time a person comes over, or they're not regular visitors. But it sounds like OP's MIL is regularly over for dinner. It would seem rude to me to not notice what they liked to drink and start keeping some around the house.", "I typically bring my giant water with me wherever I go, especially in the summers, but I have one friend who is truly (and inexplicably) offended when I bring my water to his house. So, when I\u2019m there, I leave my bottle in the car and spend the evening filling their stupid 8oz water glasses. People are weird.", "We always take Pepsi Max to my sister's house because we're fussy and they don't drink cola.This Christmas they bought some just for us! We all had a giggle over it as we ended up bringing the bottles they bought home with us. Extra Christmas present.\n\nSeriously, YTA because life is short.", "I don\u2019t think anyone needs to cater to someone\u2019s food choices if it\u2019s not a medical need if you invite them. Especially something like buying soda which is just crap processed sugary syrup. However, the fact that she doesn\u2019t want her to bring it is what makes OP TA here.", "Plus like OP added that MIL doesn't serve water with meals, she always has soda and other options so OP drinks soda. Like um, you could just ask for water if you actually wanted water? Why would that be an issue? And my parents-in-law usually don't have soda in their house because they don't drink it often, they'll have punch or other drinks when we get together, but mostly the family will just bring soda if they want it. It's never been a big deal. They usually provide food for the whole family, and people bring what they want to drink or drink what my in-laws have on hand. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f OP is just making a big deal out of nothing. If it bugs her that her MIL brings her own drink she could just do as you suggested and keep the soda on hand!", "Yep, I agree with you 100%. We don't drink much soda in our house at all, but my FIL likes Pepsi...so guess what, we keep some on hand for when he comes over to visit.", "Something about you doing your parenthesis as if this is a math equation and we are applying the caffeine free label to both things in the parenthesis because we are multiplying has made my day", "I'm not from the US, and I don't know anyone who drinks soda with meals. I remember when I was a kid, soda was reserved for special occasions - it was treated as an unhealthy thing and an unnecessary expense. \n\nWhen I visit my friends or the other way around, it's customary to offer tea/coffee, or maybe an alcoholic beverage. But if I knew that a person only drinks soda, I would keep a can in the fridge for them.", "Haha that\u2019s exactly how my adhd brain works!", "And not everyone drinks tea or coffee\u2026", "And there are fridges that dispense filtered water (if MIL doesn\u2019t have one thats a different story but i do know they are more common now)", "This is what got me. Why do you need to bring your own water? Just ask for a glass like a normal person. Furthermore, MIL only serves beer and wine with dinner! Sign me up!", "I have my big water bottle for my home and travel. \n\nI tend to drink from glasses when visiting friends/family but they do know that I will require a carafe of some sort when I see them.", "YTA.  She's trying to accommodate you by bringing her own drinks instead of bitching about yours.", "OP judges others and just assumes everyone else judges her harshly back.", "I am deceased. I can't give you gold so take my upvote.", "One of my great grandmothers used to drink soda with dinner, Italian family where the expectation was you would eat a lot of food, she would drink soda so she would belch and have her stomach feel more settled.", "> because I like a specific soda that's pricy\n\nAt first I read this as specific soda that's spicy...and I was like...Hmm That's a new one.", "A FRIEND OVER DURING THE WEEK!?", "Yes, yes, you're right but I need help!! I can't stop myself from being this offensive... *walks away in shame, literally holding soda filled glass in one hand*", "Me, too! I don\u2019t drink soda, but I have cans in the pantry for my friends who do. It\u2019s just not that hard.", "Exactly! I'm not a tea drinker (iced tea sure, but not hot tea) and for me, coffee is for the morning (go-go juice!)."]}
