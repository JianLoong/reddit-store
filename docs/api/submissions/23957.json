At first it was great, she instantly tidied up the place and generally made it a lot brighter, but for a couple of days every month she becomes absolutely awful. \n\n\nEloise has \u201cendometriosis\u201d which, as I understand it, is a condition which makes the tissue in your uterus weaker or something, anyways basically when she\u2019s on her period, all the things that normally suck about it are like 10x worse. Or at least that\u2019s how she explained it to me. Some of the things that she does on her period are: she uses my bathtub a lot to help with her cramps and though she always cleans up after herself, it\u2019s a little uncomfortable knowing she was just bleeding in it. She tends to throw up a lot on her period which makes my job (I work from home) really difficult because they can hear her in the next room over while I\u2019m on zoom calls. And guys, I cannot describe to you the smell. Like it\u2019s so bad and I\u2019ve bought her air spray to use after she uses the bathroom on her period and she has gotten better about it but still. Also, she\u2019s really lazy while she\u2019s on her period. Like sometimes she won\u2019t move for an entire day, just laying on the couch. Basically, it\u2019s become increasingly annoying for me to live with her during the (usually) 5 days or so when she\u2019s on her period. \n\nHer period is coming up and I decided I really couldn\u2019t stand the thought of having to deal with it all week. So the other day, I very politely asked her if she would be open to staying at a hotel while she was on her period so that I could get more work done and have warm water, and so on. I told her I would pay for it of course and help her pack, but she just looked at me kinda shocked.  She said she needed to think about it so I left her alone for the rest of the day. I figured she wanted to make sure there were good hotels around or something but at dinner she surprised me by saying she didn\u2019t want to leave for a week each month and that if I didn\u2019t want her here when she wasn\u2019t feeling well, then maybe we shouldn\u2019t live together. I told her she was being ridiculous and that this was no reason to ruin our relationship, but all of our friends are saying I\u2019m the asshole. If everyone says I\u2019m in the wrong I\u2019ll apologize, but right now it seems like we either break up or I have to deal with this until we do so I\u2019m kind of in an un winnable situation.", "created_utc": 1691266134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15j5c7n/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_leave_my/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Okay, I'll give you the cliff's notes version.\n\nEvery cycle, endometrial lining builds up in the uterus.  This is meant to provide a nutrient-rich place for a fertilized egg to land to start to grow a baby.  If a fertilized egg implants, hormone signals are sent to tell the body to keep the endometrium.  If it doesn't, no hormone signals are sent, and the lining is shed.  This is a woman's period.\n\nEndometriosis is when the endometrium grows outside of the uterus.  It might grow in the fallopian tubes, on the ovaries, or anywhere in the abdomen.  It doesn't take a super amount of brainpower to understand that endometrium DOESN'T BELONG outside of the uterus.  Far from making her uterus weaker, what endometriosis does is make extreme pain happen where the endometrium is growing, because it is growing in places it isn't meant to grow.\n\nThere is another thing known as adenomyosis, where the endometrium actually grows INTO THE UTERINE MUSCLE.  This is also super bad and painful and terrible and awful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that you are uneducated and lack the tiniest bit of curiosity to understand what your girlfriend is going through every month AND the fact that you're more concerned about your own comfort (ew, she bleeds in the bathtub, gross!  but she cleans it... but GROSS!) than your girlfriend's comfort tells me that you're not remotely qualified to be in a relationship with someone who gets a period.", "YTA.

You are incredibly selfish and unsupportive, she'd be better off if you broke up with her so she could find someone who is a decent, mature and caring partner. God forbid she lays about when she doesn't feel well, it can be really debilitating and she's losing a lot of iron, no wonder she's tired. I would feel so uncomfortable with you as a partner. You are a d*ck!\n\nAlso, maybe you should educate yourself a but more on these things. Endometriosis is when the uterus lining keeps growing, and leaves so much scar tissue on women, and there's nothing that can be done for her really, so have a bit of sympathy.

At first it was great, she instantly tidied up the place and generally made it a lot brighter, but for a couple of days every month she becomes absolutely awful. \n\n\nEloise has \u201cendometriosis\u201d which, as I understand it, is a condition which makes the tissue in your uterus weaker or something, anyways basically when she\u2019s on her period, all the things that normally suck about it are like 10x worse. Or at least that\u2019s how she explained it to me. Some of the things that she does on her period are: she uses my bathtub a lot to help with her cramps and though she always cleans up after herself, it\u2019s a little uncomfortable knowing she was just bleeding in it. She tends to throw up a lot on her period which makes my job (I work from home) really difficult because they can hear her in the next room over while I\u2019m on zoom calls. And guys, I cannot describe to you the smell. Like it\u2019s so bad and I\u2019ve bought her air spray to use after she uses the bathroom on her period and she has gotten better about it but still. Also, she\u2019s really lazy while she\u2019s on her period. Like sometimes she won\u2019t move for an entire day, just laying on the couch. Basically, it\u2019s become increasingly annoying for me to live with her during the (usually) 5 days or so when she\u2019s on her period. \n\nHer period is coming up and I decided I really couldn\u2019t stand the thought of having to deal with it all week. So the other day, I very politely asked her if she would be open to staying at a hotel while she was on her period so that I could get more work done and have warm water, and so on. I told her I would pay for it of course and help her pack, but she just looked at me kinda shocked.  She said she needed to think about it so I left her alone for the rest of the day. I figured she wanted to make sure there were good hotels around or something but at dinner she surprised me by saying she didn\u2019t want to leave for a week each month and that if I didn\u2019t want her here when she wasn\u2019t feeling well, then maybe we shouldn\u2019t live together. I told her she was being ridiculous and that this was no reason to ruin our relationship, but all of our friends are saying I\u2019m the asshole. If everyone says I\u2019m in the wrong I\u2019ll apologize, but right now it seems like we either break up or I have to deal with this until we do so I\u2019m kind of in an un winnable situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

AND THEN IT ALSO IS SHEDDING.\n\nImagine how fucking painful that must be. That tissue is being ripped from surfaces all over her abdomen, leaving scarred tissue and lesions. \n\nShe is not lazy. She is not gross. She is in SEVERE PAIN. Telling her to suck it up and take Advil is cruel\u2014Advil doesn't do *shit* for that kind of pain. \n\nIf you wouldn't be grossed out by her getting a cut while shaving in the bath, you shouldn't be grossed out by her getting some period blood in the tub and cleaning it right away.\n\nYou need a real shot of empathy real fast, pal.", "You've got to be an internet troll! Endometriosis can be so painful that Advil can barely do anything for the pain.", "This is a joke, right? Pain management for endometriosis is narcotics. Treatments of endometriosis can consist of surgery, whether to laser off the scar tissue, or hysterectomy. This isn't a hangnail and you need to figure it out quick.", "Hahahaha...\n\nHahahaha hahahaha hahahaha", "Hook yourself up to one of those period pain simulators. Take advil ahead of time\u2026", "That\u2019s not AT ALL how endometriosis pain works you muppet", "I don't have endometriosis and an advil still doesn't relieve the pain all the way. I can't even imagine what she is going through on top of being asked to leave her own home during a hard time.", "You gotta be kidding. You have internet where you can look for what endometriosis is and get information reasons, symptoms and how it is treated. You seem to be capable to do research but rather stay ignorant and buy ibuprofen. Jeez.", ">Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It can cause severe pain in the pelvis .....\n\nfirst thing on the page when i goggle the word.\n\nSEVERE PAIN\n\nPlease break up with her. You have put ZERO EFFORT into understanding what she experiences 1/4 of the month. \n\nZERO EFFORT plus shaming her for her bodily functions.\n\nYou are not mature enough to date her, and maybe you should limit  your dating pool to post-menopausal women who are past that pesky menstruation phase that you can't handle.", "YTA. I really hope you\u2019re joking. That\u2019s the stupidest thing you\u2019ve said so far and believe me, most of it was stupid and ignorant.", "The govt would beg to differ. You see once you had her move in, even with free rent, she is a tenant. If she doesn\u2019t willingly move you will legally have to evict her per your laws. That may take 3 months, 6 months or longer depending on laws and back log.", "Then you\u2019d have no problem with her finding somewhere else! Great glad we solved this for you.", "Wow. You\u2019re just doubling and tripling down on the ignorant stupid comments.", "I hope your friends figure out who you are and show this to Eloise so she knows she's *not* being ridiculous talking about not being together.", "that doesn't stop it being her home - it may not be her house/flat or whatever, but it is her home i.e. the place she lives", "Nope. You\u2019re partners, you share a home, it belongs to both of you for as long as you stay partners. Do you really think she should be treated as a guest in her own home just because you happen to pay for it? Your money entitles you to kick her out of her home whenever she is inconvenient for you?", "I told her money was not an issue, and I don\u2019t want to break up with her. She\u2019s sweet and funny and has been great to live with literally every other day of the month.", "So then what can I do? I feel like I\u2019m out of options and I know it sounds kinda selfish but im really at my limit.", "\u201cI\u2019ve tried nothing and I\u2019m all out of ideas!\u201d", "On YouTube there are videos called \"Irish People Try....\". They have one with the period pain simulator. Multiple twosomes. They have the guy go first and then the women. NONE of the guys could make it anywhere near the top setting while I'm pretty sure all of the women did. It's awesome.", "I\u2019m not kicking her out. I offered to pay for a hotel which will honestly probably be more comfortable than my apartment.", "Because people want a partner they can go thru good and bad times with and you are like bye I only want you for fun times.", "Have you done the math? Let\u2019s average a halfway decent hotel to be $100 a day. That\u2019s $500 a month. $6000 a year. She\u2019s 23, so she\u2019s got 20 years of periods left at least. $120K over your lifetimes.", "1. Encourage her to talk to her doctor ASAP and explain how much pain she is in. She may need a presciption pain reliever for her periods.\n2. Get rid the awul, unsympathetic and yes (YTA) idea to make her leave during those days. If it bothers you so much you can't be home with her and you like the idea of a hotel so much, why don't YOU go to a hotel and let her stay in the house with the amount of pain she's in.", "You should leave her and stay single. Forever. No-one deserves a partner like you, not even you with all your mind blowing assholeness.", "It\u2019s not kinda selfish. It\u2019s selfish.\n\nIf she had any other chronic illness would you make the same offer?\n\nWhat do you do? You talk to her. Ask her what she needs from you when it comes to support. Is there anything that helps or minimizes symptoms? Does her doctor have any advice for partners?\n\nIs her doctor recommending surgery? What other options are there? How can you help?\n\nHold her head when she\u2019s throwing up. Help clean the tub. Do whatever you can to help her not feel shame for something she can\u2019t control and doesn\u2019t want. \n\nDon\u2019t make the problem worse by ostracizing her and making her feel alone in her most painful and vulnerable moments.", "YOU\u2019RE at your limit? She\u2019s the one bleeding, vomiting, in incredible pain. How do you think she feels? Honestly if you are this selfish then you really shouldn\u2019t be in any relationship", "Aw, pumpkin.  You're suffering so much.  It must be exhausting for you to be such a selfish, unkind person.  Poor thing.", "What limit? You didn't do anything? Buying Advil is nothing? And all she is doing is use the things in her apartment, and be left alone.", "IDEA\n\nYOU go to the hotel for the week :)", "Consider investing in a sex doll, they don't have any \"gross\" bodily functions, and don't expect any emotional connection from you.", "Date men", "Have some damn empathy that\u2019s what you can do", "You can educate yourself properly. You can ask her what you can do to help. You can stop panicking about blood being in your bathtub because if it wasn\u2019t for your mother\u2019s menstruation, you wouldn\u2019t even exist. You spent the first 9 months of your existence floating around in fluid that would make you clutch your pearls if you found it in your bathtub. \n\nA lot of women with severe endometriosis need surgery to correct it and even that is not guaranteed. I\u2019m sure you would expect her to have sympathy for you if you were sick with stomach flu. Or would you be ok going to stay in a hotel while you\u2019re vomiting and dealing with explosive diarrhea? Seriously, grow up and learn how to have empathy for someone you supposedly love.", "It sounds selfish because you are selfish. If this is your attitude you should not be living with a woman, especially not one who has a medical condition that makes 1/4 of her entire month a literal hell on earth. YTA and I hope someone punches you in the balls, continuously, with brass knuckles, for 5-7 days every month so Eloise can tell you to take an Advil and get over it.", "You\u2019re obviously not mature enough yet to live with a woman. Not joking.", "Not kinda, it IS selfish.", "There's nothing comfortable about feeling like you've been exiled from your own home.", "Why don\u2019t you go to a hotel then?!", "You obviously have never tried to soak in a hotel tub because 1) the water doesn't get hot 2) a lot of hotels don't have tubs 3) the water pressure sucks!\n\nYes, you are wanting to kick her out for your own selfishness.", "You told her to stay somewhere else.  That is kicking her out.", "When you are sick would you rather stay in a random hotel (including transporting yourself to said hotel and bringing all your bags up and back down and then transporting yourself home) or your home, where you have everything you need, know where everything is, have food and water, medication, etc to feel better. Idk about you but the only place I want to be when I\u2019m sick is my own bed and the last place I want to be is a random hotel.", "Obviously not, since she wants to stay. And it\u2019s her apartment too. Don\u2019t pretend this is a favor for her, you\u2019re trying to make your life easier because you can\u2019t handle having a partner who has a chronic illness.", "Oh I get it, you're doing this for her comfort.  How noble of you.  YTA", "THIS EXACTLY. Who wants a fair-weather partner?"]}
