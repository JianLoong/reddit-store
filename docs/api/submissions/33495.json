It\u2019s never too late to suffer the consequences of your own actions. She\u2019s old enough to know how to act appropriately. \n\nWhen I was 13 my great grandmother gave me a little jar of pennies for Christmas and had I done anything other than look thrilled my mother would have killed me. But I knew my great grandmother had very little money and a bad memory. I hugged her neck and said it was the best present I got that year. At the time I was lying but while writing this I realized I still have that jar of pennies. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what else I got that year. Your daughter needs a heavy dose of empathy.\n\nEdited to add NTA. I apologize for the breach in etiquette.", "NTA - but don't just take away all of her presents, take that phone away, too.  Too many parents fail to set consequences for this type of behavior and then their adult kids go out into the world incredibly rude and entitled.  You would be doing us all a favor.", "\"She think is I am a huge jerk\" Of course she does, she's 16 and you're her parent. Her thinking that you are a jerk is a sign that everyone is doing their job.\n\nThe \"take away all her presents\" might be a little harsh. But overall NAH.\n\n(Only 4 more years until she's not a teenager, hang in there.)", "NTA I think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation of a teenager. As a side note, I\u2019d get her evaluated. She may just be an asshole, but I had similar issues and it turned out I had PMDD. I wasn\u2019t evaluated and received no treatment until I was an adult. And by then even my parents were convinced I had a bad personality which has been hard to come back from.  It\u2019s probably more her just being in that phase of life but I\u2019d just get her checked out, maybe do some counseling and see. Just in case.", "NTA.

Maybe a more directly related consequence would be to take away phone, computer, tablets (anything she can communicate with) and ground her over her Christmas break and perhaps a bit longer. If she can\u2019t socialize politely with people she finds annoying then she doesn\u2019t get to socialize with anyone. I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you still took away the presents too. What she is doing is insanely rude and disrespectful to an elderly disabled family member that loves her. This kind of brattiness needs to be nipped in the bud. Is she going to roll her eyes at a boss or a coworker that she finds annoying? That\u2019s a great way to get fired or written up by HR.", "NTA, but the reality is even if you follow through it won\u2019t teach your daughter the lesson she desperately needs to learn. Right now, best case scenario she is learning that she has to pretend to be fake in order to get presents. However, the real world will eventually teach her that she can\u2019t treat people like that and expect to succeed. She\u2019ll either be ghosted by all of her new friends in college/uni or she\u2019ll get fired from her dream job for being such a b**** to everyone she deems as annoying.

Those silent daggers and eye slinging shows her immaturity. Yes, even some old people pull that mess. And frankly, it\u2019s best that they stay home or in this case, go to her room. Taking away the presents I don\u2019t think is a good solution as to resort to that, means that she put an damper on the gathering. As a guest, I would vote, let her be elsewhere. If a gift, I would just leave it.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI feel so sad for your mother. She bought your daughter a gift and she been treated like this by her.\n\nYour daughter is just rude and I don't think she should be rewarded with gifts from her grandmother. You should ground but I solution I find effective is treating her like she is treating your mother. When she talks, roll your eyes, make signal for her to speak faster or slower. And if she complains (she will) you say \"what? Is that hurtful? So why do you do it to your grandmother?\"", "NTA, but don't take presents away.\n\nFirst and foremost: Trying to blackmail good behavior with taking away christmas or birthday presents NEVER DOES WHAT YOU WANT IT TO. If you think taking those away will suddenly make her less sour, it's gonna be a battle you will lose.\n\nIt should be very simple: She behaves well-mannered for \"set amount of time\". Don't expect her to be jolly all day, she's a teen, she simply won't be. Just give clear expectations of like \"I expect you to be downstairs and actively participating with family socializing for 2 hours during the afternoon and for the entirety of dinner, desert and x amount after\". Outside of those times, let her do her own thing up in her room where she's not bothering anyone.\n\nIf she isn't able to behave herself for that amount of time, she can go to her room without a phone, computer, TV, game console etc etc etc. She can just go sit in an empty room.  \nAnd subsequently for every hour or half an hour that she misses, she gets to spend another day at home, grounded, with no phone, computer, tv, e.t.c.\n\nThat way, you give her some leeway into being miserable on her own in her room, while also showing up for some family bonding. And you give her the opportunity, if she does mess up and gets sent to a mindnumbingly boring room, to change her mind about her attitude and minimize the damage for herself.\n\nAnd if there's the \"It's fine to ground me, because friends are not around at this time anyway\", then be sure to let her know that in addition to that time, she gets the exact amount of time grounded when the friends **are** around.\n\nTaking away gifts will just create more bad blood, and once you've done that and she's still sour, you have nothing left to do. So instead, keep in mind that she wants autonomy and to be an adult, so like an adult her choices will have coonsequences that are more longterm, will be consistent and make her actually THINK while suffering said consequences, so there is a good chance she will clean up her act on the spot instead of after the fact.\n\nAnd then one warning should be enough. \"Behave yourself, we made clear expectations. One more type of this behavior will not be tolerated.\"", "So punishments have to be connected to the crime that takes place: if she isn't polite, then she's not going to be invited to talk to Grandma/socialise with the family, which means Grandma won't give her gifts and neither should the rest of the family. We don't reward people who are mean to us. \n\nI think you're NTA. But when you take away presents you need to say why. \n\nEdit: I also think you maybe need to ask your mum if you can hold onto the gifts and apologize for your daughter's behaviour ruining her excitement for Christmas exchanges. And tell her your daughter can get them at her birthday if she shows a change. \n\nAnd please don't force your daughter to volunteer at an old folks home or to work at a foodbank. That's just inflicting her attitude on people who don't deserve it. If you want to change her attitude, I think you need to get her in therapy. I don't know how you make her more empathetic, I think that's a professionals job.", "Is your daughter kind of an introvert? If not, she really need to be \"educated \" well. Sometimes being harsh is needed tho. But if she is an introvert, you need to find another approach. \n\nNTA", "If your daughter don\u2019t stop with this nonsense.  I miss my granny everyday..", "I'd leave the presents but take her phone until school starts again.  She cares more about that than anything else it seems.

She has to live like that every day and figure it out - your daughter only has to have patience for her once in a while. \n\nAlso, you can talk about how you're dealing with this change in your mom, and that it's a tough situation for you, too, especially so when your own kid refuses to have some patience with someone you love very much, and who loves her (your daughter).\n\nTalk about how special the holiday is for her grandma, and how much she's been looking forward to celebrating it with her grandchildren. It would suck to make her feel badly because of something she can't control. Does your daughter understand that her grandma can't control how quickly she speaks?

Good luck, OP!", "I'm an introvert and I wanted to just sit in a corner and read, but I was taught and knew the social conventions. I understood I was going to be kinda bored and annoyed but that it was just a few days and I'd live through it. \n\nAlso, I was lucky that I talked to someone or read something that made me ask questions like \"what is your first memory\" and \"how did you and grandpa meet?\" and \"what was your first job?\" and other things like that.

That phone would go first. I hope you have it on a family plan with an app where you can take control of it.

You don't have to be all holly-jolly. You do have to sit there and be, at the very least, not rude. If you behave, you get your phone back after. If not, you get your phone back New Years' Day.\n\nIf she chose to not go or otherwise make a power play, then Christmas gifts would come into play.

I agree with the reasoning laid out by most folks itt, in that you are clearly not going to fix this problem by taking away her presents, but the more I think about it the more it just feels pointlessly cruel. Your daughter isn't arbitrarily choosing to act this way. She's acting this way because she feels this way. If you want to change her behavior, you need to help her understand and manage her feelings. Instead you have chosen to threaten her with something that's just going to make her even more unhappy. Why would you do this? You were a 16 year old once, same as you. Surely you remember how emotionally fraught that period in a child's life can be. There's no way you seriously think taking away her presents is going to help. No way.\n\nIf your goal is simply to punish your daughter by making her feel like shit, then yeah, go ahead.

The minute their health changed, it was still scary. \nI avoided seeing my grandmother as her health deteriorated because I was scared. I still regret it to this day, but even knowing that, when my grandfather started to get worse I also found myself kind of hiding and letting my parents talk when we visited. I was an adult though and knew I had to suck it up or I would regret it again. I imagine if I was 16 I probably would have reacted poorly too. \nI would talk to your daughter and see how she feels. Even if her grandmother\u2019s health seems fine otherwise, if her grandmother went from being fine when she was a kid and now is starting to have obvious signs of health issues, in this case issues with her speech, it could be freaking her out. \nDoes that excuse her being rude? of course not.

I would play the piano for her, tell her what was going on in high school, show her photos, etc. I don't know how much she understood or remembered from moment to moment, but it made her happy at the time. It makes me sick to think of someone being rude and dismissive to a vulnerable elderly person, and being 16 is absolutely no excuse. If your daughter is uncomfortable with illness or dying then she is unfortunately going to have a hard road in life, since those things are inevitable.
