Those silent daggers and eye slinging shows her immaturity. Yes, even some old people pull that mess. And frankly, it\u2019s best that they stay home or in this case, go to her room. Taking away the presents I don\u2019t think is a good solution as to resort to that, means that she put an damper on the gathering. As a guest, I would vote, let her be elsewhere. If a gift, I would just leave it.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI feel so sad for your mother. She bought your daughter a gift and she been treated like this by her.\n\nYour daughter is just rude and I don't think she should be rewarded with gifts from her grandmother. You should ground but I solution I find effective is treating her like she is treating your mother. When she talks, roll your eyes, make signal for her to speak faster or slower. And if she complains (she will) you say \"what? Is that hurtful? So why do you do it to your grandmother?\"", "NTA, but don't take presents away.\n\nFirst and foremost: Trying to blackmail good behavior with taking away christmas or birthday presents NEVER DOES WHAT YOU WANT IT TO. If you think taking those away will suddenly make her less sour, it's gonna be a battle you will lose.\n\nIt should be very simple: She behaves well-mannered for \"set amount of time\". Don't expect her to be jolly all day, she's a teen, she simply won't be. Just give clear expectations of like \"I expect you to be downstairs and actively participating with family socializing for 2 hours during the afternoon and for the entirety of dinner, desert and x amount after\". Outside of those times, let her do her own thing up in her room where she's not bothering anyone.\n\nIf she isn't able to behave herself for that amount of time, she can go to her room without a phone, computer, TV, game console etc etc etc. She can just go sit in an empty room.  \nAnd subsequently for every hour or half an hour that she misses, she gets to spend another day at home, grounded, with no phone, computer, tv, e.t.c.\n\nThat way, you give her some leeway into being miserable on her own in her room, while also showing up for some family bonding. And you give her the opportunity, if she does mess up and gets sent to a mindnumbingly boring room, to change her mind about her attitude and minimize the damage for herself.\n\nAnd if there's the \"It's fine to ground me, because friends are not around at this time anyway\", then be sure to let her know that in addition to that time, she gets the exact amount of time grounded when the friends **are** around.\n\nTaking away gifts will just create more bad blood, and once you've done that and she's still sour, you have nothing left to do. So instead, keep in mind that she wants autonomy and to be an adult, so like an adult her choices will have coonsequences that are more longterm, will be consistent and make her actually THINK while suffering said consequences, so there is a good chance she will clean up her act on the spot instead of after the fact.\n\nAnd then one warning should be enough. \"Behave yourself, we made clear expectations. One more type of this behavior will not be tolerated.\"", "So punishments have to be connected to the crime that takes place: if she isn't polite, then she's not going to be invited to talk to Grandma/socialise with the family, which means Grandma won't give her gifts and neither should the rest of the family. We don't reward people who are mean to us. \n\nI think you're NTA. But when you take away presents you need to say why. \n\nEdit: I also think you maybe need to ask your mum if you can hold onto the gifts and apologize for your daughter's behaviour ruining her excitement for Christmas exchanges. And tell her your daughter can get them at her birthday if she shows a change. \n\nAnd please don't force your daughter to volunteer at an old folks home or to work at a foodbank. That's just inflicting her attitude on people who don't deserve it. If you want to change her attitude, I think you need to get her in therapy. I don't know how you make her more empathetic, I think that's a professionals job.", "Is your daughter kind of an introvert? If not, she really need to be \"educated \" well. Sometimes being harsh is needed tho. But if she is an introvert, you need to find another approach. \n\nNTA", "If your daughter don\u2019t stop with this nonsense.  I miss my granny everyday..", "I'd leave the presents but take her phone until school starts again.  She cares more about that than anything else it seems.

Good luck, OP!", "I'm an introvert and I wanted to just sit in a corner and read, but I was taught and knew the social conventions.

You don't have to be all holly-jolly. You do have to sit there and be, at the very least, not rude. If you behave, you get your phone back after.

I agree with the reasoning laid out by most folks itt, in that you are clearly not going to fix this problem by taking away her presents, but the more I think about it the more it just feels pointlessly cruel. Your daughter isn't arbitrarily choosing to act this way. She's acting this way because she feels this way. If you want to change her behavior, you need to help her understand and manage her feelings. Instead you have chosen to threaten her with something that's just going to make her even more unhappy. Why would you do this? You were a 16 year old once, same as you. Surely you remember how emotionally fraught that period in a child's life can be. There's no way you seriously think taking away her presents is going to help. No way.\n\nIf your goal is simply to punish your daughter by making her feel like shit, then yeah, go ahead.

She cooked a lot so she always smelled like smoke which I didn\u2019t like. But even so, I hugged her and spent time with her. Then I went study abroad during my teen years and oh boy she\u2019s the one I missed the most. It killed me to realize I didn\u2019t have much time with her. After coming back I spent all my time listening to her stories, doesn\u2019t matter now often she told them. \n\nOP, she\u2019s 16. I think you have some serious parenting to do, it\u2019s not just about this one-time punishment.", "Going right ahead and assuming that is a NTA (Pssst. That means you're top comment and should put it in there.)", "Idk  but this teared me up.", "This isn\u2019t even just about manners. It\u2019s about basic kindness and decency. If she is nasty to a sick old woman, what kind of monster is she growing into?", "I was waiting for someone to write this.  You're addressing the actual issue.  The goal is to change the way she's looking at this - not to force her to interact with Grandma just to avoid punishment or loss of privileges.  If you do, Grandma's going to be able to sense it, which will defeat the whole purpose.  \n\nShe's exactly at the age where friends are the most important thing in her life.  Having to go even one or two days without contact with them probably feels like torture to her at the moment.  She needs help reframing that so that she enjoys herself in spite of wanting to be doing something else.  For everyone's sake, including her own.", "Exactly this. The real world will punish her much more if she behaves like this.", "If you don't mind me asking, what is that? I've never heard of it. If you don't want to talk about it I'll get off my lazy ass and Google it so no pressure :)", "This is the first sensible reply I have read in this thread.", "The daughter is actively being rude. She can have what feelings she wants but the eye rolling and hurry up motions are inexcusable. \n\nManners and politeness are part of life. She doesn't need to be a ray of sunshine but she needs to be a decent human being", "She might not be talking back to Grandma, but she's definitely letting her know she doesn't want to be there and is irritated by her impediment.  This woman is in a home, and is probably living for these rare times to enjoy her family.  Probably looking forward to it for months.", "wtf how?", "Yeah, hard to hide in the corner with your phone when your phone has been taken away and locked up for a period of time.", "Take the charger away and watch her use it less and less as she tries to make the battery stretch", "I came to say the same thing.  Start with the phone.  Add in a topic or a couple of pictures to discuss with grandmother so she knows where to start.", "Pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder.  PMS on crack. It's  an oversensitivity to the normal hormone fluctuations in the  luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.  The time after ovulation and just before menstruation. Severe rage and irritability, anxiety and panic attacks, depression and suicidal ideation. It's a endocrine disorder but also mood disorder.  Current research shows women with PMDD have an altered genome that causes the over sensitivity to hormone fluctuations.", "Another comment gives a good overview of the definition. As far as how it can manifest? \n For me as a teen, I used to feel victimized and then anger because of it. And I couldnt recognize that the feelings weren\u2019t based in reality. So I really thought while I was talking back or sulking that surely the people around me saw how justified I was or how poorly I was being treated. As I grew up, it became more centered in feeling depressed, anxious and rejected. Like on completely normal innocuous behavior I\u2019d be sure that a friend now hated me and that would turn into no one liking me and my life being beyond repair. And then the hormones would clear up and it would just be gone. I would have no idea why I had gotten so upset, so low. Figuring out what I had and getting it under control truly changed my quality of life.", "I agree the daughter is being rude. But she\u2019s also still a child. Which means she needs a parent. If OP just wants to take away her gifts and punish her, that\u2019s their prerogative. However, I don\u2019t see how that fixes anything, it will likely only make the situation worse. When kids act out, there\u2019s usually a reason. It\u2019s the parents\u2019 job to figure out that what that reason is and help navigate them toward a healthier outlet.", "No, introvert often means suffering in silence while counting the minutes until you can escape and lying to everyone's faces.", "I'm not a supporter of forcing kids to 'socialize' and fake being 'pleasant'.", "If it's an iPhone, OP can just mess up the password a bunch of time, locking daughter out of the phone entirely until the clock runs out. How do I know? My mom and I had to buy my niece a new iPhone because her father took it, she became an adult and he gave it back, and in the time he had the phone she forgot her login... every mistake added minutes. We ended up buying her a new phone, there's no way to bypass it, and she was locked out for like a week at that point.", "Book. Or drawing pad", "Huh that\u2019s kind of interesting", "So at what age do you think a \"child\" should have consequences for failing to have basic manners?", "But a big supporter of making fun of disabilities", "Lol you don\u2019t need to buy a new iphone if you get locked out but it will have to be completely reset.", "She deems elderly people with disabilities annoying. Maybe you need to have a talk with her about bigotry and abelism.", "I\u2019m not saying there shouldn\u2019t be consequences. But kids act out for a reason, it\u2019s a symptom. Finding out what those reasons are, and addressing the actual root cause of the problem will get you a lot further as a parent than just punishing a kid because they don\u2019t behave the way you want them to.", "Is she annoying? Rude? Critical? Cruel in that special way of old people? Also why aren't you so hellbent on forcing the older kids to interact?  Or are they old enough to pay for thier own phones?", "My guy this is not the subreddit to get an unbiased answer about your teenage kid. Most of these people are teenagers or continue to act like one well after their teenage years. They are going to identify more with your 16 year old and defend her until they are blue in the face. They don't care about manners or niceties.", "Nope.  See, here's the deal, if you don't have a resentful teenager at the event, then there won't be an issue."]}
