I work full time and make a decent money, and I have some savings set aside from what my late husband left us. I have been building a college fund for my son for past several years, and he knows this and was fully expecting to receive it when he graduates this year. \n\nOkay - so over the past couple years he\u2019s dated several girls for a few weeks to months at a time. They all seemed nice enough, and he was having a good time, so I didn\u2019t mind, as long as he was careful. But about 3 months ago he brought home his latest girlfriend (Lisa, she\u2019s 17), and we really formed a connection. She doesn\u2019t have a great home life, and started seeing me as a trusted adult in her life. Yesterday she called me in tears, and she was almost hysterical so I told her please come over straight away, it\u2019s going to be okay. She asked if my son was home and I said he was not. She came over and I tried to comfort her, and she said that she was pregnant and her parents were kicking her out of the house. I told her she could stay with us and would always be welcome here. She said she wasn\u2019t sure about that, in a kind of sarcastic and angry way. I asked her why and she said my son broke up with her because she was pregnant. \n\nI was furious with him - he was out with his \u201cfriends\u201d and I called him repeatedly until he picked up, and I told him I cannot believe I have raised such a selfish person who cannot even be bothered to support the girl he claimed to love, and his own fucking child. I said even if he does not want to take responsibility for this, Lisa and her baby are going to be part of our family that she is going to live with us. I said I would give his college fund to her to help her start a life for herself and the baby. He was shocked and said I should be in \u201chis corner\u201d because I\u2019m his mom. I said well fuck that, you don\u2019t deserve to have someone in your corner right now. Then I hung up on him. He came home late at night and went straight to his room. \n\nThis is such a messed up situation, I just want to hear someone else\u2019s opinion. Am in the wrong here? Was I too harsh, is there something I could be missing?", "created_utc": 1697110079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1764p3i/aita_for_telling_my_son_that_his_pregnant_ex_is/", "score": 792, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But before you go making life changing decisions like giving away your son\u2019s college fund I\u2019d 1) confirm the pregnancy and 2) get a paternity test. You honestly don\u2019t know the whole story here as of yet. \n\nIf it turns out she is pregnant and it is his, then by all means go forward with your plans of her moving in and being supportive. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d give away *his* college fund right off the bat though. If he is having a child, he needs to have an education and a stable job to financially support his kid. \n\nA honest heart to heart with just your son is definitely needed as well. I totally understand that emotions were flying high when this all happened, but you don\u2019t want to lose you son in the process of all this if you don\u2019t have to. Some tough love may be needed & he needs to be accountable for his part in making this baby, but completely pushing him away isn\u2019t what you want to do either. \n\nThen I\u2019d sit down with both of them and figure out all this is all going to work, what the expectations should be & are going to be with this dynamic. Will she be going. To school too? Helping around the house? Who\u2019s helping with appointments & expenses, etc. there\u2019s a lot here to work out! \n\nGood luck!

Have you even confirmed the pregnancy? \n\nThe point I\u2019m making is that giving away a whole college fund is a permanent decision, and you need to make sure your son is actually the father and he is really going to abandon his kid before you do that.", "Woah,  momma, i get it, I'd be pissed too. First and foremost, DNA test. She can be upset as she wants to but you nor your son shouldn't be saddled with the cost of raising a baby that potentially isn't his. This is to cover everyone's ass. Second, if this child is his, he needs to have an education so I would suggest you keeping the money yourself, using half paying for his schooling while he either works part time or takes out loans to cover the rest. There is no need to give this girl a lump sum of an entire college fund at once, that's mighty irresponsible.  You can help pay for the babies needs as they come with the other half of the college fund. As she is newly pregnant and 17, she can also get a part time job and start saving up until time for maternity leave bc I assume she's still in high school too so part time makes sense. As for the living arrangement, that's a tough one. If you have extra room, it's your house and you have final say as to who lives there and who doesn't. Your son may not like it but if he's the father, he needs to realize your not going to let your grandchild be homeless. As for anything else, only the future will tell, I'm just suggesting what needs to happen as of right now.

You can't know for sure, you don't know the girl that well to be able to tell for sure. What if she did this to get out of her house? Maybe your kid knows something you don't, so I suggest listening to him first.\n\n2. Don't strip him of the opportunity to go to college.

They all seemed nice enough, and he was having a good time, so I didn\u2019t mind, as long as he was careful. But about 3 months ago he brought home his latest girlfriend (Lisa, she\u2019s 17), and we really formed a connection. She doesn\u2019t have a great home life, and started seeing me as a trusted adult in her life. Yesterday she called me in tears, and she was almost hysterical so I told her please come over straight away, it\u2019s going to be okay. She asked if my son was home and I said he was not. She came over and I tried to comfort her, and she said that she was pregnant and her parents were kicking her out of the house. I told her she could stay with us and would always be welcome here. She said she wasn\u2019t sure about that, in a kind of sarcastic and angry way. I asked her why and she said my son broke up with her because she was pregnant. \n\nI was furious with him - he was out with his \u201cfriends\u201d and I called him repeatedly until he picked up, and I told him I cannot believe I have raised such a selfish person who cannot even be bothered to support the girl he claimed to love, and his own fucking child. I said even if he does not want to take responsibility for this, Lisa and her baby are going to be part of our family that she is going to live with us. I said I would give his college fund to her to help her start a life for herself and the baby. He was shocked and said I should be in \u201chis corner\u201d because I\u2019m his mom. I said well fuck that, you don\u2019t deserve to have someone in your corner right now. Then I hung up on him.

God bless you.", "NTA for calling your son out on being a jerk. His actions so far have been completely unacceptable.\n\nBut Id take a breath and not make any rash decisions.

First of, I would suggest you have a calm and friendly talk with your son, so you can hear his side of the story. Yelling at him, cursing him out, and even giving away his college fund is way over the line, and is not how you treat your children. It is very important that you listen to him, and hear what he has to say. There's likely way more to this story than what you've heard so far. \n\nSecondly, people tend to forget that getting pregnant requires two people. Staying safe during sex is just as much the girl's responsibility as the guy's. You can't blame your son for getting the girl pregnant, it was just as much her fault. Also, abortion is an option. If she doesn't have the child, this entire situation is as close to solved as it can get. \n\nThirdly, taking away your son's college fund is the worst thing you can do in this situation. You pretty much destroy any bond you have with your son, and the chance of him leaving and cutting ties with you is really likely. Also, if you ever want your son to be able to take care of a potential child, he needs an education. If you take that away from him, you're making everyone's lives a lot harder. \n\nYou completely overreacted and handled this situation really poorly. You should, as the adult, try to be sensible and handle this in a proper way, and not just let your emotions take control.

And I mean thank goodness this means she won't be pregnant and homeless.", "Why is that so hard for you to believe? She stated that this 17 year old doesn\u2019t have a great home life and sees OP as a trusted adult. Why is it so strange for them to have formed a parent-child type of relationship?", "Because she\u2019s emotionally stunted and projecting her single-mom feelings onto this girl she barely knows over her own kid. \ud83d\ude44", "As stated...check the statistics on single teen moms. \n\nExpecting teenagers to go from party town sexi fun to working, also in school, living together, reliable parents is a fantasy.", "I'm going with YTA because we don't know that. She took the girls word for everything and lashed out at the son without even trying to talk to him about it or give him a chance to explain or change his mind. Sounds like they both have impulse control issues and his knee jerk reaction at the news was not necessarily what he will do. There is always 2 sides to a break-up and we have no idea what actually happened. I would say E S H or N T A if she had sat down with him to talk about it first, but the way she went from 0 to 100 and put all the blame on him makes her worse. It takes 2 people to make a baby and Lisa needs to take responsibility for the consequences of her own actions too.", "He broke up with her because she got pregnant. Not cause she cheated. And if that was the defense why not say so? Why just say \"you should be in his corner\"", "Reign yourself in because I didn't say that. The choice to continue this pregnancy is her choice and hers alone, so yes, she selfishly chooses. I never said this pregnancy was created only by her, but you keep taking those leaps, right off the cliff.", "Agree. Urgh I\u2019m Trying not to be judgey but did she expect he was going to respond with? They\u2019re 17/18 going out for 3 months. Yeah sex. Consequences  responsibility blah blah blah but why would you saddle yourself with a kid so young when you\u2019re going to do this mostly in your own and you don\u2019t really have a clue about the 100% 24/7/365 commitment? Her career options are already limited. Social security will be scant. Cost of living going up. Babies having babies. That\u2019s not to say she can\u2019t be s good parent. But yikes!", "Unfortunately he doesn't seem to be great at pulling out", "I love this comment.", "If it\u2019s his.", "We don\u2019t know if it was unprotected or not- condoms, IUDs, the pill , etc. are all fallible and if this is the U.S., sex education in most states is non-existent.", "Why would him breaking up with her because he wanted her to have an abortion make anything about his behaviour better? It\u2019s not his choice. It\u2019s hers. If he was so adamant about not wanting a child he should have taken precautions.", "This is what i thought as well. It was harsh to give away his college fund when not sure yet the baby was his.  Overall,  if the son has an education the possibility of getting good high paying job is high and if the baby truly his,  he can support them.  But if the baby not his,  then you can forget your son.", "I m not sure but it didn\u2019t sound like he tried to defend himself or accused her of anything. OP talk to your son NTA", "In case OP is reading this, I couldn\u2019t disagree more with this take. OP is not the asshole for giving son\u2019s college fund away. Actions have consequences. He had unprotected sex at an age at which he was unwilling or unable to take care of a kid. That was his decision, no one else\u2019s. \n\nHaving a baby is an expensive endeavor and support is needed. If son doesn\u2019t want his college fund taken, then he needs to get a job to start making money to support the kid. That\u2019s literally the definition of what a parent has to do. \n\nAlso, OP is not hypocritical. Lisa\u2019s parents kicked their daughter out. OP is not kicking her son out,  but ensuring that he is responsible for his actions by using college funds to support what a father needs to support.", "No you're right, all women are good and pure and never ever do anything immoral or selfish, obviously men make up all cases of women doing bad things to make themselves look better.", "Even people with two dead parents make it work.", "you can go to community/state college without massive debt fwiw.", "I\u2019m a woman but I\u2019ve seen this before.", "Resentment? For dying?", "Agreed. All that\u2019s missing from this post is her yelling at her son that he\u2019s just like his father.", "A 17 year old with a bad home life they want to escape. She sees her bf has a nice mom and a stable home and wants that. This is her answer.", "That's a harsh take. OP is a mother, but she's not *just* a mother, and her son is being an asshole. Should she just overlook it because they share DNA?", "It\u2019s weird. She\u2019s a 44 grown ass woman who has only known this girl for 3 months. Are you all so emotionally neglected that you think this is normal??", ">He broke up with her because she got pregnant. Not cause she cheated. \n\nYou know this how? OP doesn't because she never actually bothered to have a conversation with her son. He got 1 word out, that's it. She should be in his corner until it's proven that's his child, the odds of this being paternity fraud are high.", "You said it, it's your quote man. We have ZERO idea where OP lives and if that's even on the table, or their personal feelings on abortion (while I think it's the only choice here, I can't make that for her and some people feel very strongly against it for various reasons). She's already pregnant, and most likely with OP's son's child. It takes two to tango and it's her body- if she wants to keep the baby, the law is pretty cut and dry as to his responsibilities (if OP is in the US, at least). \n\nThe one and only comment I've seen from OP is that Lisa wants to keep the baby, even if it didn't happen the way she had hoped. She's got time to think that over, but regardless of her choice, it's not selfish to not be forced into abortion. If OP's son didn't want a kid, he should have done a better job of preventing it from happening.", "it's an unfathomable amount of hardship to me", "Take my award!\ud83e\udd47 \ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "What, so a girl who's in a relationship gets pregnant and your mind automatically goes to the fact she's sleeping around? What kind of fucked up sicko are you? She's 17 FFS!", "Yesss, he definitely needs to get a paternity test. It probably is his though.", "Definitely a valid question.", "Who cares if it's his kid? The girl won't be any less pregnant, and OP is the only trusted adult in her life.", "Non existent? Bro I got the college level sex ed . I saw a condom go on a banana.", "The fact that sex ed. is almost non-existent in the US is the reason I am fairly confident that it was unprotected sex. \n\nYes, condoms fail but not as often as a ziplock bag.  My own son was using these because he didn't want to buy condoms.  Cost or shyness in the drug store, either way it's best to just provide them.  It's not like he would use them to wrap a sandwich.", "I agree he should have taken precautions.  He may in fact have taken the precaution of asking if she was on birth control, and she may have lied about it--we don't know. They may have used condoms incorrectly.\n\nIt makes a difference because this should be a joint decision.  If she is adamant about keeping the baby against his wishes then she has to realize that his contribution may be limited to court-ordered child support.\n\nPersonally the only time I didn't wear a condom was the times my wife and I were trying to have children, up until I had a vasectomy.  I think that is what all responsible men should do.", "Right?!!? Like OP is being soooo hypocritical. I feel so bad for her son.\n\nNot to mention, she\u2019s trusting some rando over her own son. Like huh?", "Yes, of course. But there is usually money that is for the surviving child's future. OP said there was savings from the late husband AS WELL AS the college fund. The savings can help the grandchild without stripping the son of something that was promised to him. That is going to create issues within the relationship that will likely never heal. Especially since this money came from his dead dad.", "Did they pick you?", "Cool misogyny, SIS.", "It's still a form of abandonment.  I got really pissed with my husband for dying.  I was left at the age of 37 with two teenage boys.  \n\nHow dare he leave me with 2 kids to raise, we were supposed to grow old together, he knew how hard it was for me when my mum died when I was a teen!\n\nIt's unreasonable anger, but it's usually there for a while at least.", "And for being left alone", "Well the son isn\u2019t dead so\u2026.", ">her son is being an asshole.\n\nIf that's not his baby how is the son being an asshole?", "Wow, you didn't need to personally attack me over a conversation lol. Her grandchild's mom now, so awesome. Feel how you feel but I think you're the weird one. Have a wonderful day though. \ud83d\ude01", "I don't think you need to bring other commenter's emotional needs into this, just because we're able to sympathize with a pregnant, homeless 17-year-old who hasn't had a great family life.", "How do you know? Clearly he got at least a whole sentence out", "Yup. In this respect I\u2019m glad I\u2019m female (and live in a country/state where abortion is legal). I\u2019d hate to be a male and the final decision is not mine (as it should be of course! ) coz no way I\u2019d want to be stuck being forced to be/financially support a kid I didn\u2019t want.", "I think they're just saying that they shouldn't sign over their only child's college fund until they're sure and have had a paternity test. OP barely knows this girl. Her son was only dating her for a short while. It's entirely possible that she's been seeing other people.", "Damn, are you thirsty for arguments or did somebody shit in your cereal? Maybe both.", "No. OP said the kids were dating different people for a couple weeks or months at a time. Unless a couple is in a long term committed relationship, it\u2019s completely reasonable to question paternity.", "He was sleeping around so it\u2019s equally feasible that she could be too. It\u2019s not a judgment, just a fact.", "You think 17 year olds don't sleep around? lol", "She absolutely shouldn't give his college fund away if it's not his.", "If it\u2019s not her sons kid this isn\u2019t OP\u2019s business and the girl definitely shouldn\u2019t be given any money. OP barely knows this girl, she\u2019s just acting impulsively", "Then It\u2019s not his responsibility and he shouldn\u2019t lose his college fund.\n\nThey dated for 3 months. Spare me the \u201ctrusted adult\u201d crap. She\u2019s known this girl for like 10 minutes and chose her over her own child.", "In my district we literally had zero sex ed, not even abstinence only.

Giving away the college fund is too far, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s at question here.", "No, she said her son was not Lisa. He has literally just broken up with her because she was pregnant after seeing her for 3 months.", "She said her son was doing that, not this current girlfriend", "Even if it is his, I wouldn\u2019t give thousands of dollars all at once to a 17 yr old pregnant woman.", "It\u2019s OPs money, so yeah it\u2019s OPs business. It\u2019s called free will.", "Surely he would have told his mom his concerns if he suspected her of cheating and the baby not being his.
