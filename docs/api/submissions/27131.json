A couple days ago, she met with me and the rest of the bridal party to discuss what the plan was for hair, makeup, dresses, etc. At first it seemed reasonable. She\u2019s going for a winter wonderland type of theme, so blue dresses (all in different shades, lined up as a gradient) with silvery accents, snowflake jewelry and soft makeup, even blue contacts for those of us without blue eyes. Last one\u2019s a bit weird, but it\u2019s no big deal to me, I\u2019ve worn color contacts for Halloween. \n\nThe bit that ended up being an issue for me is that Zoe requested we all get our hair dyed. A couple members of the bridal group are natural blondes (with dyed ends), and so is Zoe (but she wants to go platinum for the wedding), but the rest of us are two brunettes, a strawberry blonde (she wasn\u2019t \u201cblond enough\u201d?), and a redhead. I\u2019m one of the brunettes and I\u2019m the only one in the group who has never dyed or bleached their hair. I\u2019ve considered it, but I can never stay settled on what I want to do, and I\u2019d hate to spend money on something that I end up hating. On top of that, my mom spent from ages 5-13 flat ironing my hair almost every single day. It really damaged my hair. I\u2019m almost certain it\u2019s resulted in my hair being thinner than it used to be. I know bleaching can also damage your hair, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable taking that risk yet.\n\nI told Zoe I wouldn\u2019t be able to dye my hair. She insisted it would be fine, as my hair seemed quite healthy and she would be paying for the bleaching treatments for all of us. I again said no, thanks so much, but I can\u2019t. I asked if I could just wear a wig and she said no, that wigs are cheap and unnatural, and she wants us to have our real hair bleached instead of some cheap imitation for the day. After more back and forth, she told me I should go home and think about the fact that I\u2019m ruining her vision and that I\u2019d be ruining the photos and wedding video that she and her fianc\u00e9 (30 M) will be putting together for his grandparents (84 M & 82 F) to view, since they won\u2019t be able to fly in from Argentina. I apologized, paid for my meal, and left.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to dye my hair, but I also don\u2019t want to ruin Zoe\u2019s picture perfect day. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being difficult or wrong here, but am I?\n\nEdit: For a little clarification on how things stand and what\u2019s expected, I\u2019m a 6-7 on the hair color scale. The other brunette is a 5. Zoe wants the six of us to be at 9-10. She only wants herself to be platinum. She currently sits at a 10 on the scale. Also, I do not have dark eyes. My eyes are green. Two of the other girls do have light brown eyes though.", "created_utc": 1695053485, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lzpid/aita_for_refusing_to_bleach_my_hair_for_a_wedding/", "score": 4067, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So if you are quite pale with brunette hair, having really pale blond hair, could really wash a person out.

A couple days ago, she met with me and the rest of the bridal party to discuss what the plan was for hair, makeup, dresses, etc. At first it seemed reasonable. She\u2019s going for a winter wonderland type of theme, so blue dresses (all in different shades, lined up as a gradient) with silvery accents, snowflake jewelry and soft makeup, even blue contacts for those of us without blue eyes. Last one\u2019s a bit weird, but it\u2019s no big deal to me, I\u2019ve worn color contacts for Halloween. \n\nThe bit that ended up being an issue for me is that Zoe requested we all get our hair dyed. A couple members of the bridal group are natural blondes (with dyed ends), and so is Zoe (but she wants to go platinum for the wedding), but the rest of us are two brunettes, a strawberry blonde (she wasn\u2019t \u201cblond enough\u201d?), and a redhead. I\u2019m one of the brunettes and I\u2019m the only one in the group who has never dyed or bleached their hair. I\u2019ve considered it, but I can never stay settled on what I want to do, and I\u2019d hate to spend money on something that I end up hating. On top of that, my mom spent from ages 5-13 flat ironing my hair almost every single day. It really damaged my hair.

She insisted it would be fine, as my hair seemed quite healthy and she would be paying for the bleaching treatments for all of us. I again said no, thanks so much, but I can\u2019t. I asked if I could just wear a wig and she said no, that wigs are cheap and unnatural, and she wants us to have our real hair bleached instead of some cheap imitation for the day. After more back and forth, she told me I should go home and think about the fact that I\u2019m ruining her vision and that I\u2019d be ruining the photos and wedding video that she and her fianc\u00e9 (30 M) will be putting together for his grandparents (84 M & 82 F) to view, since they won\u2019t be able to fly in from Argentina.

You\u2019re going to **need** a wig after that, or you\u2019ll be rocking a very short pixie cut.", "I didn't mind the winter theme until the eye and hair thing came up. I got married in December because my husband and I both love Christmas. My girls wore royal blue, and there were twinkly lights and Christmas ornaments everywhere. Of course, everyone did their hair how they wanted and wore their own eyes to the wedding. \n\nThis is something else entirely.", "Why don\u2019t these brides just hire actors?", "I have a synthetic lace front that fools people I\u2019ve known for years. And that\u2019s even when I have been lazy and didn\u2019t glue it down. Modern synthetics can even be curled with heat. The one I\u2019ve got only cost me $85. She could spend less money paying someone to lay and secure wigs than dying your hair. \n\nShe is next level controlling. NTA. Back out of these shenanigans.", "I bet all the bridesmaids are of a similar height and build, as well. They were chosen for how they would look in the photos, not for being valued friends or family members.", "the grandparents from Argentina are really selling the nazi vibe", "Are all the bridesmaids pale with light eyes? Because the nazi theory is starting to make a lot of sense", "At least with a piercing it would take a lot less sessions and time to get done and you can remove it with minimum scarring in the future. It would take years to fully regrow your natural hair or lots of money and more time redyeing.", "Sad truth, but WWII era men kept fathering children til the 90s. It could be much closer family than that.", "But Ana (the sister from Frozen) has strawberry blond hair. So if it's Frozen-themed, why are the redheads having to dye?", "Are you okay? \n\nThis post says so much more about you than it does about Zoe.\n\nYou need to seriously reevaluate your self worth and overall life values if you think having someone this narcissistic and insanely unreasonable as a friend is normal.\n\nNo intelligent woman I know would even put up with this bitch (Zoe) for a second.", "My sister in law is Argentinian, and not the \u201cwhite kind\u201d. It\u2019s not a joke. Her parents are of Russian and Italian descent, they left, because \u2026well yeah.", "She might well be aware. But yeah, don't bleach your hair for this. A friend demanding this is very weird.", "I would say they're going off the theme of Elsa from Frozen if I hadnt seen the comments here. If they were going for a Frozen theme, being red head shouldnt be a problem given Anna is a red head. The whole enforcing the blonde hair and blue contacts for everyone makes it weird and raised the whole Aryan suspicion.", "The blue eyes made me wonder", "Right! Even on TV shows with a huge budget its easy to clock colored contacts. Especially blue ones.", "Plus the wedding is, like, 15 months away. Anything can happen during that time regarding appearances.", "Some people are worth melting for. \n\nBut maybe not this bride.", "I just told my husband how our vow renewals will be themed", "It\u2019s why Harry Potter didn\u2019t have green eyes in the movies. Daniel Radcliffe couldn\u2019t tolerate the contacts.", "I guarantee you this bride has never once paid close attention to any black women in her life, if there are any. Not enough to notice if they\u2019re wearing a wig. \n\nNo way in hell she can clock anything nicer than a Party City wig.", "yeah i\u2019m now leaning into the whole argentine nazi thing if she assumes wigs will always have disasters. There\u2019s really good lace fronts out out there not to mention glue or have someone professional lay it on. I do cosplay and im not black but the best wig tutorials are from black women", "Seconding this. I literally have an appointment on Saturday to get most of my hair cut off after severe damage from over-processing. It was mid-back, now fully half of it has broken off at chin length or shorter and I'm trying to salvage what's left. OP, do NOT take this risk!", "I am a ginger and never would I ever dye my hair for some Elsa fanatic. NTA", "I get the feeling once OP declines to be a bridesmaid, she will get disinvited all together. Which probably isn\u2019t a bad thing. I wonder what totally ridiculous rules she is telling guests to follow.", "They're all pale, and apparently the bride wants them to all have light blue eyes and platinum blonde hair. The theory about Nazis, eerily enough, makes a lot of sense.", "Now you know the answer to that. Do you think Zoe has any BIPOC friends? Frank for sure dies not. Heh", "I'm not sure I would feel safe attending her wedding.", "Fair enough! Thanks", "I have dark brunette hair color and to get the shade of blue I wanted back in my 20's  I needed two sessions of bleach to get it the whiteish as possible. It was a mess, and it was just my fringe. I cannot imagine what OP will have to deal with bleach over damaged hair.", "Yes. Years ago I wanted blonde highlights in my midbrown long  hair.. The hairdresser over cooked my hair with bleach and my hair started breaking.  I went from almost  waist length hair to a crop to conceal the damage. Then they tried to get me to pay. \ud83e\udd2c", "Never been on Broadway, but I've done a fair bit of community theatre and I've worn a bunch of wigs.", "and they don't fall off!", "I lived down there and it was surprising how much Nazi memorabilia was available at the Feria. Argentina is notoriously racist against any color other than clear. Drop out of this wedding OP.", "Yeah I came here to say this. What the heck with these overwrought \u201cvisions\u201d for a wedding anyway? I don\u2019t understand how that generation enjoys this shit. It sounds so very tedious to me (I\u2019m in my 40s; a good wedding to me is a short and loving ceremony and plenty of dancing with loved ones afterward).", "Sure, Ive got a buddy named Frank who was born and raised in Germany. But Germans aren't 60% of the argentine population.", "Can I suggest that the last line could be the frizz never bothered me anyway ?", "Reddit is truly filled with talent!", "Lol I would give you an award if there were still awards available to give", "There was a genocide in the late 1800\u2019s to try and get that done.", "That's sad. And racist", "I would like you to know that Gabriel the Angel had brown skin in A Charlie Brown Christmas, and that teacher can get fucked.", "OMG that\u2019s horrible and I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. I\u2019d like to remind that teacher that Mary and Jesus were Middle Eastern Jews. Wonder what she thinks they looked like?", "When I read your post I thought the bride request was absolutely bananas but when I read there was a redhead I gasped. Do not bleach your hair. But the redhead - it won't ever be the same and there is no good blending she can do, and red roots are bizarrely ugly. The best part of being a redhead for me (and natural brunette/anything!) is healthy hair and no money at the salon aside from cuts. This would cost 18 months for my length of hair - is she going to pay for the highlights and blending for that whole time too? It will destroy all of your hair, weird family from Argentina aside.", "As a natural redhead who frequently bleaches my hair, there's absolutely no way that my stylist can reproduce my natural color and it's a mess if I just try to grow it out. I've had to chop all my hair off twice now in order to get it back to natural.", "It. Will. Take. YEARS.", "Why on earth would anyone do this for a wedding?? It\u2019s an absurd and entirely disrespectful request.", "So she\u2019d have to either shave her head or deal with regrowth for literally YEARS so that someone can get some hokey, cliched wedding shots? Are you for real?", "Eventually, but it grows on average half an inch a month in adults. Depending on how long her hair is, it will be YEARS before her hair is ever the same again. And that relies on her having a very obvious line of regrowth because she won\u2019t be able to dye the virgin hair that comes through.", "Imagine that happening today! Hell, I was upset when I was 6  because I couldn't be the \"main\" angel because the teacher said Shelly, the girl with the long long hair had to be because Angels had long hair. LOL I was second tier.. but I ended up not being able to go because I got the measles.", "AMEN!"]}
