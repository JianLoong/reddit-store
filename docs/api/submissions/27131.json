A couple days ago, she met with me and the rest of the bridal party to discuss what the plan was for hair, makeup, dresses, etc. At first it seemed reasonable. She\u2019s going for a winter wonderland type of theme, so blue dresses (all in different shades, lined up as a gradient) with silvery accents, snowflake jewelry and soft makeup, even blue contacts for those of us without blue eyes. Last one\u2019s a bit weird, but it\u2019s no big deal to me, I\u2019ve worn color contacts for Halloween. \n\nThe bit that ended up being an issue for me is that Zoe requested we all get our hair dyed. A couple members of the bridal group are natural blondes (with dyed ends), and so is Zoe (but she wants to go platinum for the wedding), but the rest of us are two brunettes, a strawberry blonde (she wasn\u2019t \u201cblond enough\u201d?), and a redhead. I\u2019m one of the brunettes and I\u2019m the only one in the group who has never dyed or bleached their hair. I\u2019ve considered it, but I can never stay settled on what I want to do, and I\u2019d hate to spend money on something that I end up hating. On top of that, my mom spent from ages 5-13 flat ironing my hair almost every single day. It really damaged my hair. I\u2019m almost certain it\u2019s resulted in my hair being thinner than it used to be. I know bleaching can also damage your hair, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable taking that risk yet.\n\nI told Zoe I wouldn\u2019t be able to dye my hair. She insisted it would be fine, as my hair seemed quite healthy and she would be paying for the bleaching treatments for all of us. I again said no, thanks so much, but I can\u2019t. I asked if I could just wear a wig and she said no, that wigs are cheap and unnatural, and she wants us to have our real hair bleached instead of some cheap imitation for the day. After more back and forth, she told me I should go home and think about the fact that I\u2019m ruining her vision and that I\u2019d be ruining the photos and wedding video that she and her fianc\u00e9 (30 M) will be putting together for his grandparents (84 M & 82 F) to view, since they won\u2019t be able to fly in from Argentina. I apologized, paid for my meal, and left.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to dye my hair, but I also don\u2019t want to ruin Zoe\u2019s picture perfect day. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being difficult or wrong here, but am I?\n\nEdit: For a little clarification on how things stand and what\u2019s expected, I\u2019m a 6-7 on the hair color scale. The other brunette is a 5. Zoe wants the six of us to be at 9-10. She only wants herself to be platinum. She currently sits at a 10 on the scale. Also, I do not have dark eyes. My eyes are green. Two of the other girls do have light brown eyes though.", "created_utc": 1695053485, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lzpid/aita_for_refusing_to_bleach_my_hair_for_a_wedding/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A couple days ago, she met with me and the rest of the bridal party to discuss what the plan was for hair, makeup, dresses, etc. At first it seemed reasonable. She\u2019s going for a winter wonderland type of theme, so blue dresses (all in different shades, lined up as a gradient) with silvery accents, snowflake jewelry and soft makeup, even blue contacts for those of us without blue eyes. Last one\u2019s a bit weird, but it\u2019s no big deal to me, I\u2019ve worn color contacts for Halloween. \n\nThe bit that ended up being an issue for me is that Zoe requested we all get our hair dyed. A couple members of the bridal group are natural blondes (with dyed ends), and so is Zoe (but she wants to go platinum for the wedding), but the rest of us are two brunettes, a strawberry blonde (she wasn\u2019t \u201cblond enough\u201d?), and a redhead. I\u2019m one of the brunettes and I\u2019m the only one in the group who has never dyed or bleached their hair. I\u2019ve considered it, but I can never stay settled on what I want to do, and I\u2019d hate to spend money on something that I end up hating. On top of that, my mom spent from ages 5-13 flat ironing my hair almost every single day. It really damaged my hair.

She insisted it would be fine, as my hair seemed quite healthy and she would be paying for the bleaching treatments for all of us. I again said no, thanks so much, but I can\u2019t. I asked if I could just wear a wig and she said no, that wigs are cheap and unnatural, and she wants us to have our real hair bleached instead of some cheap imitation for the day. After more back and forth, she told me I should go home and think about the fact that I\u2019m ruining her vision and that I\u2019d be ruining the photos and wedding video that she and her fianc\u00e9 (30 M) will be putting together for his grandparents (84 M & 82 F) to view, since they won\u2019t be able to fly in from Argentina.

You'd have to do multiple appointments spread out over months to get to the level she's looking for without melting your hair.  Don't do that.  Don't permanently damage your hair for *someone else's* vision for one day.  If she wants the look, she needs to compromise with a wig.

This doesn't *immediately* imply superiority but has been integrated into the Western zeitgeist as a person who matches this description.\n\nIt's important to note there is a difference between \"Aryan\" and its convoluted history and multiple colloquialisms, and *Aryanism*, which is the harmful ideology that being physically fair *does* make one superior (which Hitler supported).\n\nImplying Zoe wants an Aryan-themed wedding, using Western influence, is technically accurate.", "It\u2019s because Nazis loved that look and then escaped to Argentina after WWII. Your friend very well may be descended from Nazis.", "The jokes are because blue-eyed pale blonde was the ideal for the Master Race.   I can see where that may not be where the bride is coming from (winter theme with all white and wintery), however for a lot of people, it may sound like she is some kind of Neo-Nazi.", "I mean she wants only blonde hair blue eyed participants in her event so that\u2019s the link clearly, plus you\u2019re on reddit where people like to joke. It\u2019s utterly bizarre to want to change someone\u2019s physical characteristics under the guise of \u2018winter\u2019.", "that's legit the vibe I got reading this! blonde hair and blue eyes is mandatory, huh? HMM.", "I've never worn color contacts, but I'd be super mad too. I'd have to spend an insane amount of money to get them in my prescription, because I'd be almost completely blind without the prescription ones. Not being able to wear my normal non-color contacts to help me see would be a HUGE dealbreaker.", "Maybe, maybe not. Argentina was a haven for high-level nazi officials looking to escape Germany and prosecution after the end of WWII.", "Hey, in no way do I think this is a reasonable request. It's weird. Like really weird. But that doesn't mean OP doesn't want anything g to do with her. If she does then that much less of a headache for her but if she doesn't dropping out is the only way around it.", "A lot of officials from nazi Germany fled to Argentina after the war so if the grandparents are very adamant about that then it would raise red flags", "Funny thing is if she gets her \u201cvision\u201d it\u2019s very likely in just a few years she\u2019ll look back at her wedding pictures and cringe", "Everyone's thinking frozen or some hitler-esque scheme, but I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  You're going to be awfully surprised when you enter the venue and see the groom in Arnold Schwarznegger's Mr. Freeze costume from Batman and Robin.", "She seems really hung up on the theme. Tell her to \ud83c\udfb6\u201clet it goooo\u2026.\u201d\ud83c\udfb5", "I think she missed the whole point of the movie, then if she loves it so much she wants to do a whole winter wedding and you all will be Elsa look alikes. \n\nBasic theme - be yourself. Being someone you aren't is what caused the whole trouble in elsa's life. And when she accepted herself and stopped being scared. Bam magic. Good relationship with her sister, whole kingdom is good again. \n\nSo maybe ask her to watch it again and pay attention. \nForcing people to wear contacts and dye hair is not very Elsa.\nOlaf would agree. \nOr tell her you will happily be Anna instead in her dress up play.", "Tell her to let it go cause these are horrible requests. I\u2019ll be surprised if she ends up with anyone in the wedding party. Even Olaf wouldn\u2019t put up with that!", "Actually now that you mention the decade, maybe they were actually not in the war, because they would have been babies. Possible children of Nazis that escaped?", "Honestly, I hope it\u2019s a joke, but I would not bring it up to Zoe. Let her keep her story of Elsa, whether true or a cover (and who knows, maybe she does think it\u2019s for Elsa and Frank is covertly doing it for a different reason). Even the hint of a mention of doubt re Nazis will likely blow up in your face.  You\u2019re already on her bad list for not complying - I would leave it at that.  This could go wrong in so many ways, both because this suspicions right or wrong. Seriously, if you were my friend, for the sake of your sanity (and maybe safety), I would leave it alone. Just tell her you don\u2019t want to do it, but you understand she has a vision and maybe somebody else would better be able to bring it to fruition.", "Wear a blonde wig and I will lend you my Star of David necklace.", "Like they can die happily knowing that their granddaughter has propagated an Aryan social circle in America.", "It\u2019s quite a scary thought actually.  Like she needs to do this blue eyed blond haired aesthetic to please her grandparents in  Argentina? That has Herrenmenschen written all over it.", "Tell her it'd be a real disaster if the stylist bleaching your hair over-processed it and you ended up looking like Angelica's Cynthia doll (*Rugrats*).\n\nIf she ends up kicking you out of the wedding for not complying, I think you can consider yourself to have safely dodged a bullet. This shit is just going to escalate from here.", "I feel extra bad for your friend who is a redhead. She will never get her natural color back if she bleaches it.", "Black women wear wigs all the time and manage them daily with minimal issues. The bride is banana pants.", "Don\u2019t agree; she\u2019s being unreasonable.", "Under no circumstances bleach your hair! I hope you\u2019re not considering it! I\u2019m getting married next year and I can\u2019t imagine putting anyone through that, as someone who has bleached my hair and had to get a buzz cut. It\u2019s insane to expect you to do it for ONE day that\u2019s not even YOUR wedding!", "NTA.  If you are so inclined, tell her that bridesmaids are meant to support the bride as her close friends.  You are not props in some Broadway musical.  If your hair is more important to her than your support on her big day, her vision is more impaired that coordinating colors can fix.", "But if it's bleached blonde it isn't your \"real\" hair now, is it?\n\nAnd turning brunette to blonde will be beyond disastrous to your hair's health.\n\nI would think you want your wedding pictures to reflect how your actual friends looked when they celebrated your union. But then I'm old.\n\nTell the bride she can hire a blonde actress to play you in the wedding, that way the pictures will come out fine.\n\nNTA.", "Let\u2019s pretend for a moment that the bride\u2019s demands aren\u2019t absolutely bonkers (they are) and just consider the logistics and potential outcome of bleaching your hair. \n\nIt takes a talented, experienced, and often expensive colorist to do blonde well. And because you\u2019ve never color treated your hair before, working with a top-notch colorist is that much more important. You simply don\u2019t know how your hair will respond to bleach. How will your color pull? What shade and tone will work best with your complexion? How will blonde work with your eyebrows and do they need lightened? How will you need to adjust your makeup? What happens if something goes awry, like you didn\u2019t realize your hair has a lot of red in it and you end up orange - who\u2019s paying for the second appointment to get it right? And then what the fuck are you supposed to do after the wedding? Who\u2019s paying to get your hair back to normal? \n\nThe bride is far more concerned with her (extremely strange) vision than she is with honoring her friendships with actual human women.", "\"meine gro\u00dfe, fette aryan Hochzeit\"", "Im trans, my eyes are wide open to that shit sadly the fact that the grand parents are in Argentina didn't escape me too", "It was my immediate thought when reading it and I'm still not completely convinced it's not a factor.", "Grandparents from Argentina too.", "I am guessing all the bridesmaids are caucasian?\n\nthose wedding pictures are going to look BORING if every girl is just a copy paste with identical hair and everything.. variety is way more fun, and sounds like there is a good variety of hair colours in the bridal party!\n\nSuper curious to know if the bridal party all has the same body type as well and if not, if bride is mandating  exercise regimes so you can all look like stepford wives", "I have astigmatism and the colour ones they recommended for me didn't \"fit\" so they kept floating around in my eye.

OK, byyeeeee* \ud83c\udfb6", "I remember hearing that the Nazis who fled to South America have compounds that are still active so this strikes me as possible.", "Really??", "Even if they were props/characters in a Broadway musical: most people on Broadway with long hair wear a wig.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Get it blonde, get it blonde, or don\u2019t talk to me anymooooreee! \ud83c\udfb6 I don\u2019t care if you never bleached your hair\u2026 go now to the hair salon\u2026 your excuses never bothered me anyway", "That would not be surprising. People who were in control and faithful followers of the Nazi ideology, and tried to take over the world with it - I honestly do not think they would give up those views just because the war did not go their way.  I could very much see this being a matter of fleeing, regrouping, and restarting.", "She will have to wait until it grows out naturally.\n\nIt took me 2 years to grow out my bleached hair, my hair grows relatively fast and I take B12 shots.", "Oh it\u2019ll be OVER for her. Even if she tries to dye it back close to her natural hair after the wedding, no dyes really do well in mimicking natural red hair. And it\u2019ll never be the same.", "Can\u2019t she just let her hair grow until her natural color/roots are grown out enough that she can cut away the bleached hair? I mean it would probably take a while, but wouldn\u2019t her proper hair eventually grow back out?", "Theoretically, her hair could return to her natural red at some point. But it would take SO long with no guarantee.  \n\nThis is a really crazy thing to ask of someone.", "That would take literally years. Is your red-haired friend willing to basically sacrifice her hair and completely re-grow it so your bride friend has the wedding photos of her dreeeeams?? Red is the hardest color to duplicate, and it's also the fastest dye color to fade.", "Who would be willing to do that??? It would look so weird in the meantime.", "It would probably take literal years to ever get her hair back to pre-bleach. Seems like a big ask for a one day event.", "It\u2019ll never be the same and your redhead friend would be really dummy if she went blonde for cosplaying as an Elsa assistant for her friend\u2019s wedding.", "It will be the same after growing out, but it will take years to do so.\n\nIt will likely look really bad while growing out though.", "It\u2019ll look really bad for the brunettes too.
