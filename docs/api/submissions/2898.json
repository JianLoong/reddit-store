It\u2019s professional mental health support to process the loss of the future you envisioned for yourself and the acceptance that a biological child is likely not in the cards for you. And it\u2019s support in navigating the healthiest and most ethical options for you moving forward once you\u2019ve accepted that reality - and *perhaps* that path includes surrogacy, adoption, or fostering. \n\nYou are not obligated to offer up your womb just because she is in pain.

I hope I am wrong but start taking some of these steps now since your family wants your sister to adopt your child and trying to demand you be a surrogate.\n\n1- call your dr and password protect your medical information. They will put a code on your chart that only you will know.\n\n2- save all text messages and record any conversations that is had about the subject. You may need this for a protection order later. Any thing that is said to you personally. Document it . Time, place, date, what was said and who said it.\n\n2- install a ring door bell and a camera in your home. If your parents, sister or anyone else has a key Chang all locks.\n\n3- let the hospital know where you are giving birth that no one is to be given any information about you or your child with out your permission. Let them know specifically your sister, mom or bil is not to be let around your child\n\n4- if you are not married. Draw up a will and appoint someone as guardian and your power of attorney. That away if something happens to you during delivery they will be the ones making medical decisions for you. Even if you and the baby daddy are together but not married your mother will be yours and the baby\u2019s next if kin. If documentation isn\u2019t already in place the baby daddy will have to go to court to get his rights. By then she can have grandparents rights established.\n\nI hope I am wrong but the above prevention steps may help later on. I have a feeling they are not going to give up on either forcing you to be a surrogate or trying to take this baby by claiming your unfit to raise it.\n\nI hope for your sake I am wrong. But they are already over stepping major boundaries with you and this child. This will not stop. You may need to get a protection order to protect your child. Protect your child at any coast even if that includes going no contact.\n\n\nEither way your sister, mother and bil are giving off major hand that rocks the cradle vibes.", "I sympathize with your sister, but she is WAYYYYY overstepping.
