{"id": 4819, "submission_id": "zmro81", "title": "AITA for wanting to build a fence that will block my neighbors' view?", "selftext": "Background: My wife and I scrimped and saved to buy a small piece of land and a trailer in rural Ontario after staying in hotels and friends' spare rooms throughout Covid. We are working to get everything up to code and are abiding by all the rules and laws, but funds are still tight. Most of our neighbors are incredibly kind and gracious, offering help whenever possible and we try our best to return their kindness.\n\nHowever, our neighbors across the street have had a bone to pick with us since day 1. The previous owner of the property had an older RV which came with the property and has blocked their view of the river behind us for years. I admit that it is a bit of an eyesore and had previously been working to get it to a point where it can be moved after we placed a more functional trailer on the property, in line with the barn behind us so as to not further obstruct their view. We did have to live in the original RV briefly while getting our \"new\" place ready, but it has since been vacant.\n\nIn attempt to make peace, I told them in the Summer I don't like to make promises but that I was working to get it moved before the end of the year, which I was. At first they responded well, but that did not last long. The husband actually does not seem to care much and is understanding of the situation. The wife, however, is out for blood. She has reported us to the city several times and the most recent, they sent an inspector who told us we needed an additional permit and could not have two trailers on the lot. I am making the case that the new trailer is actually now a home as we have lifted it over the wheels, placed at temporary skirt that will be upgraded/replaced in the Spring/Summer, plus it is a \"Park Model\" trailer to begin with, is not designed to be moved, and is now blocked in place by our hydro pole.\n\nI previously had every intention of moving the RV to give them their view back, but now I'm leaning towards doing the opposite. I do not want to be petty, but I no longer feel any need to go out of my way for these people, and instead would like my privacy from them. We are thinking of putting up a fence as they have reported us for other things that turned out to be a waste of city resources investigating as we had all the necessary permits in place already.\n\nTo make matters worse, due to our budget, I am going to building it from recycled materials. I have already spoken to several other neighbors who are all for it, and have even offered help/materials for the build. I still have qualms about depriving an elderly couple of their water view in their golden years, but they have straight up tried to have us removed from our home on multiple occasions now, so I do believe it would be warranted.\n\nEDIT: I should add that the community mailboxes for half our town are literally on our property as well. They were placed there when the lot was vacant and now they refuse to acknowledge that they are on private property. Obviously, we don't mind having them there, but I would have loved to be kept in the loop on things like changes/moves, which I've requested several time to no avail. So, we've wanted the fence for a while to give us some privacy from the constant stream of neighbors driving and walking onto our lot to get the mail. It's not about revenge, it is about having some privacy and not constantly being watched by people who want to see us homeless.", "created_utc": 1671127465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmro81/aita_for_wanting_to_build_a_fence_that_will_block/", "score": 349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
