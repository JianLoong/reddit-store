{"id": 4819, "submission_id": "zmro81", "title": "AITA for wanting to build a fence that will block my neighbors' view?", "selftext": "Background: My wife and I scrimped and saved to buy a small piece of land and a trailer in rural Ontario after staying in hotels and friends' spare rooms throughout Covid. We are working to get everything up to code and are abiding by all the rules and laws, but funds are still tight. Most of our neighbors are incredibly kind and gracious, offering help whenever possible and we try our best to return their kindness.\n\nHowever, our neighbors across the street have had a bone to pick with us since day 1. The previous owner of the property had an older RV which came with the property and has blocked their view of the river behind us for years. I admit that it is a bit of an eyesore and had previously been working to get it to a point where it can be moved after we placed a more functional trailer on the property, in line with the barn behind us so as to not further obstruct their view. We did have to live in the original RV briefly while getting our \"new\" place ready, but it has since been vacant.  \n\n\nIn attempt to make peace, I told them in the Summer I don't like to make promises but that I was working to get it moved before the end of the year, which I was. At first they responded well, but that did not last long. The husband actually does not seem to care much and is understanding of the situation. The wife, however, is out for blood. She has reported us to the city several times and the most recent, they sent an inspector who told us we needed an additional permit and could not have two trailers on the lot. I am making the case that the new trailer is actually now a home as we have lifted it over the wheels, placed at temporary skirt that will be upgraded/replaced in the Spring/Summer, plus it is a \"Park Model\" trailer to begin with, is not designed to be moved, and is now blocked in place by our hydro pole.  \n\n\nI previously had every intention of moving the RV to give them their view back, but now I'm leaning towards doing the opposite. I do not want to be petty, but I no longer feel any need to go out of my way for these people, and instead would like my privacy from them. We are thinking of putting up a fence as they have reported us for other things that turned out to be a waste of city resources investigating as we had all the necessary permits in place already.\n\nTo make matters worse, due to our budget, I am going to building it from recycled materials. I have already spoken to several other neighbors who are all for it, and have even offered help/materials for the build. I still have qualms about depriving an elderly couple of their water view in their golden years, but they have straight up tried to have us removed from our home on multiple occasions now, so I do believe it would be warranted.", "created_utc": 1671127465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmro81/aita_for_wanting_to_build_a_fence_that_will_block/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The neighbors wanted the benefits of owning your property without the expense and now that you've bought it, she'll continue to complain about every single alteration to the property as it happens. Building a fence, as long as it's permitted and up to code, will squash a lot of that nonsense because it will obstruct her view of your property and whatever goes on there. Install cameras to record in case some \"accident\" happens to your fence and keep records of all your interactions. Things can escalate over time, so keeping good records will work out in your favor.", "Nta. Obey the bylaws for sure but it is your property. Their view isnt your problem. Would be no different than planting a row of trees for windbreak/privacy.", "Your neighbors have been less than neighborly. I understand you want them to stop staring at you! NTA if you erect the fence. BUT be aware you're declaring war. Make entirely certain all your ducks are in a row. If they have anything at all on you, or any sway over local decision makers? They could retaliate in ways that would be unpleasant. they are probably doing this anyway. But this will increase their fixation & motivation.", "NTA.

If their view was that important to them, they could have bought the property when it was for sale. They did not.\n\nYour right to control what happens on a property only exists if you own it.

There is fine line between keeping the peace and appeasement and I would say letting your neighbor have his way falls strongly on the latter side.  As for fear of escalation, it seems to me that if there was a way your neighbor could have used truly problematic issues regarding your property, he would have done so already.  He made every attempt to remove you from your property.  Depriving him of his view is letting him off easy.  NTA.", "NTA. They fucked around.

You have been trying to get the RV moved (according to your own words), so it's not as if you were unwilling to compromise. The neighbor is the one who escalated the situation by going to the authorities, so even if it is a bit petty, you are well within your rights to put up the fence.\n\nI would check the regulations in your area regarding fences before doing anything, since the neighbor has already proven they are going to be a pain in the ass about every little detail...", "NTA.

I mean, I get it, we had a neighbor sue us over stupid stuff at my work, like employees riding bikes in our parking lot, and I wanted to do everything to annoy them, but didn't. The lawsuit was thrown out because the court saw we had \"risen above\". If you do it, that's totally ok and not an AH, but you catch more flies with honey and all that.

It's said that fences make good neighbors, but this really isn't that kind of a situation.  Would you be justified in doing this--totally.

You don't need to go out of your way to make her happy, and it sounds as if your neighbors are glad to help \"stick it\" to her.  You have to decide if you want to be the bigger person.
