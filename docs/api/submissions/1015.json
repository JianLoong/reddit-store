I was 4 at the time and she was 1. Two years later our mom was in a horrific car accident that changed our lives forever. My father was already married again at the time and they made the decision, him and his wife, to have her take over and \"raise us as their own children together\" even though my mom did nothing wrong and was technically still alive, just critically ill. My mom was left permanently disabled by her injuries and she was in hospital for almost a year and spent a further 3ish years in rehabilitation learning how to function again. During all this my sister and I were not allowed to see or speak to our mom and in this time my sister decided that my father's wife was her real mother and that mom was just \"dad's ex wife\" which was encouraged by him and his wife.\n\nMom was able to get to a place where she could ask the court for time with us. It started out supervised because of her disability and the time it had been since we had seen her. But the damage was done with my sister and her. My sister did not want to spend time with her, did not want her called mom. She would yell at me for hugging mom or calling her mom and would say I was \"hurting our mom\". It crushed mom. It crushed her in a way I still remember at that young age. It also made me very angry at my father and his wife.\n\nThe custody situation was fought back against by my father and his wife, who said mom's place in our lives interrupted our stability and family dynamic. We had to speak to many therapists and a GAL of the courts, I was spoken to by a social worker and the judge on the case. In the end it was decided that it was in my best interest to see my mom, and have a relationship with her, but that it was in my sister's best interest not to and to have things go back to the way they were (no contact with mom) for her. Mom was heartbroken and my father was furious that mom would get access to me.\n\nToday I am 18, in my senior year of high school and I now live with my mom and have cut off my father and his wife. I still talk to my sister but our relationship is very strained. We no longer feel like sisters. We almost feel like stepsiblings, because we do not claim the same parents anymore. That includes my father. She has talked about graduation and how she wants to be there. But she doesn't want to go with mom. She wants her parents there. I do not want them there. I do not want them in my life at all. She said she can't come otherwise. I told her I would not invite her parents just to have her there. I could hear her cry after I said it and she was mad at me for picking mom over \"my real family\".\n\nI feel bad. Despite how messed up this all is, I still love my sister, even though I'm not sure we can ever be close again. I don't want to hurt her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667465588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykwmlv/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_am_not_going_to/", "score": 1591, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then for 4 more years your Dad and SM \u201cerased\u201d your Mom, the issue is that you were old enough to have memories/connection, unfortunately your sister did not have the memories/connection.  To  a 6yo she was a stranger and one with disabilities that may have frightened her.  Again NOT her fault.  You were 9yo and saw past everything and saw you Mom.  \n\nYour sister formed a bond with your SM especially since that is who was her caregiver/parent during the formative years.  Your sister is wanting to heal her \u201cbroken\u201d family - that is her perspective.  \n\nI would suggest therapy for you because your anger is towards the wrong person - your sister.

You keep being you and be there for your mom. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, God your father is an absolute monster.", "Your dad is a true true AH", ">I could hear her cry after I said it and she was mad at me for picking mom over \"my real family\"\n\n\"YOU are part of my *real family*.  I'm choosing *you*, but you're making your attendance conditional on including other people in *your* life that I do not want in mine.  Why are *you* choosing them over me, your *real family*?\"\n\nNTA", "NTA - I agree, it's one thing if your mother choose to leave but she was forced from the accident.  Its double shitty that your father took the advantage to alienate you both from her while she was at her weakest and could not do anything. Its breaks my heart thinking she was in that hospital bed hanging on to life and not being able to see the girls she carried, birthed, and loved because of another one's spite.\n\nYour sister is not a little girl anymore; maybe one day if she has a child; she can really reflect and think about placing herself in her bio-mom situation and how it would feel if she lost her daughter or son like your mom did. Maybe than, her heart will soften on your mother's situation. \n\nShe is never going think of your mom as her real mom but what I don't understand is why she cannot view it as having two moms instead of just flat out rejecting her completely. Until then, I don't think there is anything you can say or do that would change her mind.", "Well I really hope your sister never has a child then is hospitalised for a year while some other woman steals her child. That would be a real shame. NTA", "NTA. Unfortunately your sister is telling you who she is. Arguably it's not her fault, her dad and his wife have done it to her, but the result is the same. \n\nNot getting to be part of your milestones is just another consequence of that.", "NTA- You have no obligations to invite your abusers to any major event in your life.\n\nAnd what you experienced was abuse. \"Parental alienation on the basis of disability.\"\n\nThrough no fault of her own, she lost excess to her children and you lost excess to your birth mother.\n\nStand your ground.", "> and in this time **my sister decided** that my father's wife was her real mother and that mom was just \"dad's ex wife\" which was encouraged by him and his wife.\n\nYour sister was 3. She hardly DECIDED anything at that age. Your sister is a victim here, of a sadistic father and an opportunistic and really cut throat step mother. \n\nThere will be a day when her parents crack and they let her know that your mother is her actual mother. She may discover this when she sees her birth paper (which I assume her parents keep locked away from her. \n\nShe doesn't deserve your hate or blame for sure. She was younger than you, she didn't have the knowledge or memories you did to refute the constant lies her parents told her. She didn't choose this. This is what was presented as truth and reality to her.\n\nOne of these days she'll probably buy a 23 and me kit and have her world rocked by what the truth is lol.", "Yeah, kinda. But she is way worse. Send the invite to whomever you want to your own graduation. She can come or not, but stop arguing with her about it.", "Heck I can\u2019t even imagine doing that to my hypothetical step-children.  (Admittedly, I have some amazing step-parents on both side who, with my parents, co-parented extraordinarily well, so I had good examples growing up)", "Her sister is 15 years old.", "She KNOWS.  OP has stated that the sister knows but just doesn't care.  She's no longer 3, but 15 now.  Yes, she's still a brainwashed child, but she can't claim ignorance of the real situation.", "NTA but unfortunately, she has chosen to basically be a super loyal member of a cult starring her \"parents\" as the cult leaders, so unless she *chooses* to leave the cult at some point it's really going to be better for your mental health if you just treat her as 'lost to you' and move on with your life. I wish you and your mother well.", "This is all very sad, if the cognitive dissonance ever loosens its hold on your sister she's going to need so much help unpacking what they did to her life..", "NTA. I truly wish all the best to you and your mom. I can't imagine what she must have- and must be- going through. I hope you two could see a therapist to process all this. \nAs for your dad- I would just be glad your mom and you are away from his vile presence for good. He and his awful wife deserve each other.", "This is just heart breaking, OP I am SO sorry that you were put through that kind of dysfunctional shit as a young child and the years that followed. I feel sorry for your little sister too, this all seems like it would be pretty traumatic.\n\nI can\u2019t believe how cruel your dad and his current wife have been, like I can, but I can fathom thinking that way. It takes a special kind of cruel to wish someone would die because it would make their \u201cperfect family\u201d picture easier, it takes a special kind of cruel in general. I\u2019m glad you and your mom are together, you both deserve the genuine love you are able to give each other.", "Right? I\u2019ve read some horrible stories on that sub, but I\u2019ve rarely been that angry at someone I don\u2019t even know", "\u2026 ask her if she would ever wish death upon a mother of two little girls, who loves them very much. If she says no, then ask what she thinks of people that would wish for a caring mother to die. If she condemns them then ask why her parents are different from this situation. \n\nI get the feeling you are being too protective of your sister, and you don\u2019t have much space to be if you want your relationship to survive. You have to be harsh and honest, put the mirror in front of her and let her face the reality of her awful actions. Because, yes, the moment she turned 14 she began her transition into a young adult, and should be held accountable for her actions too. Soon she\u2019ll get no do overs nor passes, so it\u2019s better for her to get used to that now whilst she has those privileges. \n\nIf she is not willing to face reality, tell her you\u2019ll be there for her whenever she chooses to wake up and see her parents for the garbage they are. \nIf she (god forbid) agrees with what they did to her, then tell her she should seek therapy on her own. She clearly has a mental disorder in that case, and needs all the help she can get. \n\nIt is not normal for a teen to discover they were forcibly taken from her dying mom and be ok with the waste of air that took her from mom. She either has a form of Stockholm syndrome or another mental disorder that those vile demons gave to her to keep her obedient and blind for them. \n\nI really hope your sister is freed from the horrible torment those two have put her through.", "Bless you for staying true to your mom. Tell your sister you hope she never has something happen to her and that her husband doesn\u2019t do to her what her father did to your mom. Karma is a Bitch but you are an amazing daughter and now women. Stay strong on your journey.", "OP your story made me remember a terribly similar story. Effectively, in this case, your sperm donor and his wife 'kidnapped' you from your mother for years to attempt alienation. Meanwhile [this story](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-bn04found112540-found-2009feb04-htmlstory.html), the grandparents didn't like the parents were moving and taking their grandchildren away. So while the parents were finishing up plans for the move and were going to return(after an agreed upon few weeks if I remember right), the grandparents thought up a way to keep the grandchildren indefinitely. They accused the parents of satan worship and sexual abuse against the children. They coached the kids, and since this happened during the Satanic Panic, there was a lot of social agitation at the idea of \"satanists\" hunting and hurting children (for an example, see West Memphis Three).\n\nAs they worked through the system trying to get their children back, it was discovered the grandparents were slowly and systematically emptying their home until one day they just weren't home with the grandchildren they retained temporary custody of. They went missing for 20 years. Even now, both children have decided to not talk to their parents or anyone, fully believing the story they were told about their parents.\n\nI'm not saying it's an impossible situation. But maybe while your sister is still young, and might listen, I'd show her everyone's opinions here, and also once you read more into the story, maybe tell her about it, because what happened to you is not terribly different to what her parents are doing to her right now.\n\nEDIT: [More information than the link provided earlier](https://www.middletennesseemysteries.com/article/474/rutherford-county-christi-and-bobby-baskin#:~:text=The%20Missing%20Persons,abduction%20as%20Mark%20attended%20seminary)", "Her reality was *shaped* by her dad and stepmom since she was 3. And I seriously doubt that as soon as the custody fight was over they stopped shaping. After all, OP still chose mom. I have no doubt they continued to warp the family to try and force OP to choose \"new mom\" and happily used little sister as a cat's paw. In fact I wouldn't be at all surprised if, because OP is NC and they can't get at her directly anymore, they were at home crying crocodile tears at or around LS so they can continue to emotionally manipulate OP through her. Which sucks for both OP and LS. But I think, OP, you're going to have to learn to set firm boundaries with LS as well, and that might mean she chooses them over you just as she did over your mom. If the two of you can afford it and she's willing, some family therapy for just the two of you might help with this, even if it's to agree to disagree. But either way, it's not feasible to allow her to emotionally blackmail you in this way. This is a fight they may continue to wage your whole life. Weddings, births, holidays, birthdays, etc. It's not fair or right but it's important you learn to set your boundaries hard and firm now.", "The sister is close behind. I can understand not having a connection to a mother you never knew, but she is a grown person who knows the situation,", "It's like you pulled all my emotions and thoughts out of my brain and wrote them down, better than I ever could.   1000% to everything you said.", "My mind protected me from some pretty severe abuse, I was watching some true crime show and it triggered a bunch of memories for me. \n\nIt was devastating for me and I almost didn't survive it. I'm just glad I had a therapist at that time who understood when I called for an emergency session it was dire. \n\nI'm sure the sister is going through something similar. \n\nIt doesn't mean you need to play into this delusion OP but just be aware. I hope you are in therapy, if so, ask your therapist how you can handle situations like this. \n\nIt will be a lot of work on your part, so be sure you want to do the work to have your sister in your life. There is no shame if it's too much.", "Honestly, it's not even a coping mechanism. She was one. She has zero memories of her biological mother as anything other than \"strange woman who tried to forcibly insert herself into my life.\" As far as the sister is concerned step-mom is the only mother she has ever had and known. \n\nDad and stepmom are vile people, but sister was either 4 or 5 when mom showed back up in her life she wasn't/was barely old enough to understand that mommy wasn't mommy. \n\nOOP was 4, would have had vague memories of mom, and would have been 7-8 and fully capable of understanding what went down. \n\nYes, sister has been brainwashed and lied to, but her reality has always been that stepmom IS mom. It's horrible, but totally understandable that she sees actual mom as an interloper.\n\nHer parents probably didn't even have to put much, if any effort into winding her up in more recent years. This random lady showed up when she was 4-5 and basically traumatized her by trying to insist she was mom and deserved to see her. It's pretty understandable that she'd hate this woman as a tween and teenager because the woman terrified her as a child. \n\nNo, absolutely none of that is fair to actual mom. Actual mom should probably sue the snot out of dad for parental alienation. But there's a reason the courts decided it wasn't beneficial for the sister to see her. \n\nFrom the sister's perspective Mom showing up is no different than a situation where a kid has been adopted, doesn't know it, and then bio mom shows up on the doorstep one day and announces she wants her kid back. Aside from the legal issues (which means nothing to a little child) that's effectively what happened. Instant removal of all stability in life. \n\nThat said, OOP should keep the ex-parents away from her. If sis can't come because she's 15 and can't travel alone, that's fine. She can make the college graduation she'll be an adult then.", "NTA, for sure. But to cut her sister some slack, she was only 3 when all of this started happening.", "She\u2019s a middle schooler and she\u2019s been brainwashed since birth.

It\u2019s like growing up in a cult or something. I\u2019m hoping that once she gets older and leaves her parents behind, she will reevaluate what happened.", "Don't answer if you don't want to, but did you ever learn about the circumstances of your mom's accident?", "This attitude will serve you well as you move forward in your life. Cutting out toxic people with no regrets, no apologies, is one of the best things people can do for themselves and so very rarely do people actually have the guts to go through with it. Best wishes to you and your mother and the life you're going to build as you continue to grow. You are a smart, capable young lady who understands what real family is. Blessings to you and yours.", "They caused permanent damage in the relationship between two sisters, most parents try to protect that relationship at all costs, but they chose themselves over you and your sister.  Absolutely despicable.", "Her world was shaped by her dad and step mom but reality is non negotiable.

Then they realised they weren't being disloyal to me if they accepted her and suddenly she was well loved.\n\nKids don't want to upset their parents and do what they think will make them happy in this case that was not seeing her bio mum. She is still a child and still feels that loyalty to her parents", "Exactly this!!\n\nYour mind protects you. You can litterally be oblivious to the fact that your mind is protecting you. But there are some behaviours that still show through that can help seeing there is something afoot.\n\nThen the delusion shatters and it crushes you. It's really hard to go through. I am glad you sought help and found it!! That's the only way to safely make to the other side without long lasting traumas\n\nFor the sister here, just because one understands her suffering doesn't mean they have to accomodate her delusion. It means when the sister finally shatters the glass, OP (and most likely the mom) will be there and forgive her behaviour", "I agree about her being young and it being instinctive to rewrite the memories. Though tbf, even 1yo can have strong bonds with their parents. Just because you don't actively and consciously remember it doesn't mean it doesn't leave a mark in your psyche.\n\nMy reasoning for calling it a coping mechanism is her reaction to the mom, even to this day. First, the mom never imposed herself, at least from what is told here. And the fact that, to this day, eve' being at the same event (not talking or even assuredly seeing the mom) triggers such a meltdown tends to lead towards a psychological hinderance. There is something very painful for her there. This is not the behaviour of someone that had to see a woman 4 times when she was 5 and then not be bothered by her afterwards. She hates her.

It means when the sister finally shatters the glass, OP (and most likely the mom) will be there and forgive her behaviour\n\nThis is so important right here. It took me so long to realize myself. I would let my sister call and pull down my own mental health because I felt bad that she didn't have the resources to get therapy. \n\nI no longer do that and she ghosted me, because I'm not allowing her to just endlessly dump on me anymore. \n\nI hope she finds her way, and I will be here when she does.", "To be fair, she was brainwashed into it.", "She\u2019s 14-15 and her parents have manipulated her and lied to her for her whole life. Also, she doesn\u2019t have memories of her biological mom, like OP does. It\u2019s awful, but she\u2019s still only a kid AND wholly dependent on her parents.

But it wouldn't be the first time I saw infertility trigger some truly despicable behavior.", "Ouch that very succinctly describes my situation with my estranged sister. My situation was quite different from yours but my sister and I had a very similar dynamic at those ages. I realized pretty early on that trying to get my sister to understand how our lived experiences were very different was futile, we were in two different realities that clashed in a way she couldn't and still can't accept. We really didn't talk from when I was 14-19 and she was 16-21. Eventually in my early 20s we started to sorta have a relationship again and would talk a few times a year but  my sister is the way she is and some of her behaviors I will not tolerate because I've learned I deserve better than that. I'd be glad to have her back in my life if she can develop some emotional maturity and stop punching down but she's going to have to come to me this time.\n\nAll of that to say adjusting your sisters skewed perception of the situation is not your responsibility to take on and there is no way to force it. At this point you have set a healthy boundary for yourself (proud of you) and if your sister refuses to respect that boundary so be it. Give it time, maybe when she grows up a bit more and gains more experiences in life she will be able to see things in a different way and your relationship can improve but it could take quite a while. \n\nEither way I think you would benefit greatly from seeing a counselor or therapist that can help you process this mess, it's a lot of trauma to carry with you so early in life.\n\n100% NTA", "I would just recommend to not push it.    Your sister has been told the truth, now it's up to her to accept it, or not.   \n\nGive your mom a HUGE hug for me.
