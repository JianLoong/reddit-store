I was 4 at the time and she was 1. Two years later our mom was in a horrific car accident that changed our lives forever. My father was already married again at the time and they made the decision, him and his wife, to have her take over and \"raise us as their own children together\" even though my mom did nothing wrong and was technically still alive, just critically ill. My mom was left permanently disabled by her injuries and she was in hospital for almost a year and spent a further 3ish years in rehabilitation learning how to function again. During all this my sister and I were not allowed to see or speak to our mom and in this time my sister decided that my father's wife was her real mother and that mom was just \"dad's ex wife\" which was encouraged by him and his wife.\n\nMom was able to get to a place where she could ask the court for time with us. It started out supervised because of her disability and the time it had been since we had seen her. But the damage was done with my sister and her. My sister did not want to spend time with her, did not want her called mom. She would yell at me for hugging mom or calling her mom and would say I was \"hurting our mom\". It crushed mom. It crushed her in a way I still remember at that young age. It also made me very angry at my father and his wife.\n\nThe custody situation was fought back against by my father and his wife, who said mom's place in our lives interrupted our stability and family dynamic. We had to speak to many therapists and a GAL of the courts, I was spoken to by a social worker and the judge on the case. In the end it was decided that it was in my best interest to see my mom, and have a relationship with her, but that it was in my sister's best interest not to and to have things go back to the way they were (no contact with mom) for her. Mom was heartbroken and my father was furious that mom would get access to me.\n\nToday I am 18, in my senior year of high school and I now live with my mom and have cut off my father and his wife. I still talk to my sister but our relationship is very strained. We no longer feel like sisters. We almost feel like stepsiblings, because we do not claim the same parents anymore. That includes my father. She has talked about graduation and how she wants to be there. But she doesn't want to go with mom. She wants her parents there. I do not want them there. I do not want them in my life at all. She said she can't come otherwise. I told her I would not invite her parents just to have her there. I could hear her cry after I said it and she was mad at me for picking mom over \"my real family\".\n\nI feel bad. Despite how messed up this all is, I still love my sister, even though I'm not sure we can ever be close again. I don't want to hurt her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667465588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykwmlv/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_am_not_going_to/", "score": 857, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then for 4 more years your Dad and SM \u201cerased\u201d your Mom, the issue is that you were old enough to have memories/connection, unfortunately your sister did not have the memories/connection.  To  a 6yo she was a stranger and one with disabilities that may have frightened her.  Again NOT her fault.  You were 9yo and saw past everything and saw you Mom.  \n\nYour sister formed a bond with your SM especially since that is who was her caregiver/parent during the formative years.  Your sister is wanting to heal her \u201cbroken\u201d family - that is her perspective.  \n\nI would suggest therapy for you because your anger is towards the wrong person - your sister.

He took the easy way out. What a terrible thing to do to young children.", "NTA your mom had something horrible happen to her that was not her fault. Visitation while she was in rehab should have been happening. Your dad and his wife wanted a picture perfect family and the way to do that was to cut your mom out. It was a selfish and disgusting decision on their part.", "NTA\n\nI pity your poor sister who was manipulated by your father", "NTA.  Your dad won't let her go by herself.  He's creating this situation and this conflict, not you.", "NTA I feel so bad for you, your sister, and especially your mom!! Your dad and step mom, I don't want to get flagged for name calling or bullying, but that was pretty shmevil. I have a son who's 2. If I was in your mom's situation it would absolutely crush me. \n\nI think your sister needs more time to mature to really grasp the situation. I think you made the right choice here. You can always do something on your own with your sister just the two of you to celebrate your graduation without your parents there.", "NTA.  Your father did a terrible, vile thing to you and your mother.  In her darkest time, tried to steal her children.  He left her isolated and abandoned.  There\u2019s no forgiving what he did.  Your sister is wrong for what she did to your Mom.  Don\u2019t invite any of them.  They all still only care about themselves.  Just take your Mom and chosen family.", "NTA at all. 1) I am so sorry for what you and your mother went through. 2) this is your event and no one\u2019s opinion matters except for yours. \n\nAnd life is long. Maybe your sister comes around one day. Let her cool off and gain a little more life perspective to see if she comes around when her brain develops a little more maturity.", "This is straight up one of the most shocking and horrifying stories I've ever read on here. Like, a horrific study of parental alienation and manipulation. Your father and his wife are evil.\n\nI'm so, so sorry to you and to your mom. You deserve so much better. I'm so sorry your sister is so deep in their clutches that she's been completely brainwashed. It's just incredibly sad. Your mom is very strong and resilient, and I'm glad you've stood by her.\n\nBest of luck to both of you. NTA, if there's any point in passing judgment here. But seriously, all my love to you and to your mom. \ud83d\udc95", "You were a young girl when all of this went down, and your life has been colored by it. If you can, try to keep your sister in the loop but she is younger than you and doesn\u2019t remember as much. Essentially, consider the brainwashing she has undergone if she throws painful words at you. But you don\u2019t have to accept phone calls and texts telling you what you NEEED to do, honeeeeee. Been there. Done that. Consider what will be able to let you look at yourself in the mirror and nod respectfully to yourself. What do YOU want to do?", "NTA. Your sister is trying to guilt you because she doesn't want to think too deeply about your dad and stepmom's horrible behavior. It's a self defense mechanism that you in no way have to take part in. You sound very mature and strong, congratulations on your future graduation and good on you for standing up for your mom!", "Nta, and your dad's a piece of work.", "NTA \n\nI genuinely feel like your sister is a bad person.  Truly.", "Does your sister know that she\u2019s her real mom? This is really disturbing behavior on her part. Adopted children even have more attachment to their bio parents. NTA", "Your sister is old enough now to know that your real mom is YOUR real mom even if it isn\u2019t hers. She is being incredibly selfish and sister by pushing this on you, giving you ultimatums snd trying to manipulate you. If she keeps doing this then I\u2019m sorry to say but it would be best to cut her off, but only if she keeps disrespecting and trying to manipulate you. It was ok when she was a child because she didn\u2019t know better, but she\u2019s too old to for that shit now", "If there is no travel involved, sister could just bring a friend for company. Sister is 14/15 now is old enough to do things with just friends and so going to a normal graduation shouldn\u2019t require an adult chaperone. Just someone to drive her and a buddy for company.", "It really reads like sis was brainwashed. I feel so sorry for her.", "OP and her sister are NTA, but sperm donor and his wife are some of the biggest assholes I've ever seen.", "Mine does too. It's all be so brutal on her and there's no fully happy ending in sight for her. I just hope this doesn't impact her health going forward. She's doing better now but I know this still weighs on her.", "Yes, I have, but it doesn't bother her what happened. She has her loyalties and to her mom is just the ex-wife even knowing the truth. She has no love for mom and has no bond or interest in her. That will always play a role in it I think.", "I think she always will see them as family and as her real parents. She has no loyalty or attachment or love for mom. She's just the ex-wife. A random woman I chose over my real family (how my sister sees it). I think even in the future she will still say my father's wife is her mom more than mom is. The best I can hope for is that she will maybe see that it was messed up or at the very least accept we don't view the same person as mom, never did and never will.", "I have no idea. I blocked them on social media, blocked their number, changed my email. I completely erased them from my life and plan to keep it that way.", "I have told her. I have made it impossible for her to deny. But she still considers the woman my father married as her only mother.", "My anger is toward my sister's parents. But I am frustrated with my sister too.", "Her falsely seeing her mother as her fathers ex isn\u2019t normal or ok. Her rejecting reality doesn\u2019t make sense. The woman who raised her should be important to her, but that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to reject reality.", "Your dad is a true sadist. His wife is about the same. \n\nNTA and my heart breaks for your mom and you.", "Your dad and his wife could have taken you and your sister to visit your mom so that both ofyou could keep the relationship with your mom. Your dad and his wife are the AH. You are NTA.", "Holy cow.  That's some dark, dark stuff you've had to deal with.  And your dad and his wife are truly awful.", "I would bet that if your sister became a mother (through any means) she might have a different reaction to the thought of a spouse stealing her child away from her.\n\nShe may never be a mom and if she is, hopefully it\u2019s in the distant future, but that is probably the point that things will click for her.", "With any luck, she'll understand if she becomes a mother herself.", "Your sister will likely resist the hell out of facing the truth because the truth will hurt so damn much. \n\nIt is likely your sister is going to end up needing a ton of therapy.  If you feel up to it, look into \"parental alienation\".  It's what your dad and stepmother did.  It's an incredibly damaging form of abuse.\n\nLooking into it may help you to understand a bit more about your own childhood as well.\n\nI'm sorry this happened.  It's horrifying how despicable your father is.\n\nI wouldn't sit here and wait for your sister to become a better person, btw, because it is possible she'll dig her head in the sand permanently.\n\nBut she was abused. And that messes people up.", "The sister was 3 when the accident happened. She was 1 when the parents divorced.", "she is the one hurting you not the other way around", "I'm sorry your sister is so set on her beliefs then. NTA for not wanting those who have been so terrible to your mom to be there for your graduation especially since your mom will likely be there as well. \n\nYour sister knows why you don't want them there...if she won't accept a compromise then that is her choice. She's still a teen, maybe things will change and maybe they won't...but I will say it took till my mid 20s(youngest) for me and my sister to talk things out and get along but we didn't have anywhere near this bad of an issue...now I'm the one she goes to when family members piss her off even tho growing up we were the ones who fought the most \ud83d\ude05\n\nAs cliche as it is....time will tell. I hope it gets better but I know it will be hard for both of you.", "INFO: why didn't your dad and step-mother have any children of their own?  Is she infertile?  Is that why they tried to convince you and your sister that your step-mother is your \"real\" mom?", "do your sister  know how to differentiate right from wrong ?\n\nit does'nt seem like it", "How old were you? How did you get out?\n\nJust curious to know if you feel like telling more of your story.", "I never will. I hate my father. I hate his wife. I do not claim either of them as parents or family. They will never know my children, will never see me marry, will never be part of my life again. As far as I'm concerned they were as good as dead to me the second they took me from my mom.", "I don't think it's them right now. But they are the reason for it because they made my sister believe mom isn't anything but dad's ex wife, so to her it would be going and not having someone to sit with, etc. I also think she wants to try and make me abandon mom and let her keep her fantasy going.", "She doesn't have a relationship with him. So she wouldn't, no. She's of the opinion he's the bad guy for his stance.", "She's also like 14, maybe 15, right now. That's still very young, and it's entirely possible she still can't actually process this.\n\nI also have a big problem with the court system that allowed zero visitation for the younger sister. This is a really bad case of parental alienation, and no visitation allows the lie to continue. Mandatory family therapy between the younger sister and mother should have been the call in place of visitation. Yes, it would be upsetting, but there's still a real good chance this is going cluck in place for the sister as an adult, and the older child not severing a relationship will ensure it can't fully be hidden. Just a move setting the younger child up for failure down the line.", "I have no idea tbh. It's not something I thought much about.", "I was technically still 17 when I did it. I just left. I went to stay with my mom and decided I was not going back. I was so close to 18 that I knew they couldn't really do anything. Then I went on a blocking spree. I have no regrets about any of it either.\n\nI'd have left sooner if I could. A lot sooner. As far as I'm concerned I would have happily lived and help take care of mom in her recovery than live with the people who did everything to steal both her children from her, and were successful with doing it with one of them.", "I\u2019m surprised the court didn\u2019t see the parental alienation they were doing.", "I hope you change your last name to your mother's. Your sperm donor and wife are despicable.\n\nNTA", "OP I really wish you all the best in your life. I feel terrible that for so many years you have had to carry this with you. \n\nI'll be honest, and this is not hyperbole on my part I promise you, your father and his wife are up there with the absolute worst people that have ever graced these threads. Truly repulsive creatures. \n\nBut it seems you neither inherited, nor absorbed any of their awfulness. You are an amazing young woman and daughter and I hope you find the peace you and your mother so value and deserve.", "She sure is living in a fantasy world", "I hated that too. I always always thought it was a dick move. The courts decided it was in my sisters best interest that she would gain nothing from a relationship with our mom and it would do more harm than good. Like I get she was upset by the whole thing and didn't adapt well. But for fuck sake mom almost died. She didn't abandon us. Or stop caring. And it in part could be what leads to the breakdown of our relationship for good too, if things can never get better.", "I mean if she can't have biological kids of her own, it would explain a lot.", "She knows the truth. She just doesn't care about it. It's not her truth.", "It's a fair point and unfortunately, parental alienation is very subjective to judges. Some take it more seriously than others. My sister had major issues with my nieces and only was able to ensure visitation after finally finding a lawyer that could stay on the case without bankrupting her. \n\nThe court almost always favors the parent who \"stays\", no matter what the reason was. In most cases, that just happens to be the mother because they are the primary care givers in most families. For my family, doesn't matter that my sister had documented physical abuse while pregnant, since she left, the court essentially helped her ex block access to my older niece initially. It was a lengthy and expensive process to even guarantee visitation eventually.", "Understood. I meant reading the comments could jolt some kind of sense. Seeing complete strangers judge this situation might help. Or it won't. It might be worth a shot. But up to you!", "She's still very young. Just keep with your boundaries and remember the version she believes is not your truth either. You can't prevent her from calling her stepmother mom, but you can insist on not calling her mom yourself. Your mom doesn't need to be excluded from your major life events. Your sister is old enough to start actively making her own choices going forward about what that means for your relationship, but it's not your fault if that means she doesn't come when your mother does.", "She's still dependent on them. Give her a few years, after she's lived on her own, or at least gone to college, she may come to understand.", "It might be. I don't see her anymore so I'm not sure if she'd read it. I could always DM her the link and hope for the best. Thanks!"]}
