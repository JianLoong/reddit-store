I was 4 at the time and she was 1. Two years later our mom was in a horrific car accident that changed our lives forever. My father was already married again at the time and they made the decision, him and his wife, to have her take over and \"raise us as their own children together\" even though my mom did nothing wrong and was technically still alive, just critically ill. My mom was left permanently disabled by her injuries and she was in hospital for almost a year and spent a further 3ish years in rehabilitation learning how to function again. During all this my sister and I were not allowed to see or speak to our mom and in this time my sister decided that my father's wife was her real mother and that mom was just \"dad's ex wife\" which was encouraged by him and his wife.\n\nMom was able to get to a place where she could ask the court for time with us. It started out supervised because of her disability and the time it had been since we had seen her. But the damage was done with my sister and her. My sister did not want to spend time with her, did not want her called mom. She would yell at me for hugging mom or calling her mom and would say I was \"hurting our mom\". It crushed mom. It crushed her in a way I still remember at that young age. It also made me very angry at my father and his wife.\n\nThe custody situation was fought back against by my father and his wife, who said mom's place in our lives interrupted our stability and family dynamic. We had to speak to many therapists and a GAL of the courts, I was spoken to by a social worker and the judge on the case. In the end it was decided that it was in my best interest to see my mom, and have a relationship with her, but that it was in my sister's best interest not to and to have things go back to the way they were (no contact with mom) for her. Mom was heartbroken and my father was furious that mom would get access to me.\n\nToday I am 18, in my senior year of high school and I now live with my mom and have cut off my father and his wife. I still talk to my sister but our relationship is very strained. We no longer feel like sisters. We almost feel like stepsiblings, because we do not claim the same parents anymore. That includes my father. She has talked about graduation and how she wants to be there. But she doesn't want to go with mom. She wants her parents there. I do not want them there. I do not want them in my life at all. She said she can't come otherwise. I told her I would not invite her parents just to have her there. I could hear her cry after I said it and she was mad at me for picking mom over \"my real family\".\n\nI feel bad. Despite how messed up this all is, I still love my sister, even though I'm not sure we can ever be close again. I don't want to hurt her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667465588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykwmlv/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_am_not_going_to/", "score": 253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It'd your graduation and you invite who you want. \n\n\nThat's absolutely horrible the way your step mum and dad prevented you from seeing your mum. They easily manipulated and controlled you guys and tried to coerced you into cutting her off.you were right to cut them off if they think they like.\n\n\nI'm sorry for your mum and hopes she's doing well.", "NTA why does your sister get to decide who your \"real\" family is? she doesn't YOUR Gradution so you decide who you want to invite and if the invited person decides against it, that is their choice as well.\n\nStop hurting yourself in the relationship with your sister, you deserve not to hurt, she is the one hurting you not the other way around", "NTA. Your father and his wife sound like truly terrible people, taking advantage of an accident to steal his ex's children from her... whoof! I can see why you cut them off. Presumably your sister knows all this as well, and is just siding with them because they're the only family she knows. Even so, I'd let her know that she has an invite, her parents don't, and if they can figure out a way to make that work you'd love to see her. (Assuming you'd love to see her - I don't think you actually said whether you actually wanted her to come?)", "NTA\n\nOof, this a lot OP. I\u2019m sorry to hear that the concept of \u201creal\u201d family has been so difficult for you and that so much hurt has happened along the way. \n\nINFO - does your sister have a different trusted adult that could chaperone her to your graduation? If she truly wants to support you she shouldn\u2019t need to bring people who have hurt you to YOUR graduation.", "That is just such a shitty situation. If your mum had left you by choice I could maybe see your sister's side but it was an *accident*. NTA but do try to cut your sister some slack and try to maintain a relationship with her since she is only 15 and might see things differently and change her mind once she matures a bit. \n\nHowever cutting out your father and his wife is completely your choice and justified. If they didn't try to just pretend like your mum died, none of this would have happened and you could still have a functioning family. I'm just wondering how happy they would feel if your mum hadn't recovered.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't get to decide who your 'real' family is or who comes to your graduation.", "NTA. Just invite your mom's side of the family and call it a day. Are you going to torture yourself for the rest of your life over someone who refuses to change? You can't change people. Learn that lesson now, it's less painful and it will save you unnecessary heartache in the future. Your sis and your \"father\" and step mom are poison.", "NTA. This is a really crummy situation. Your sister technically did grow up as her step mom being her \u201creal\u201d mom, it\u2019s all she\u2019s ever known. Whereas you were old enough at the time to have grown up with your mother for a few years before the terrible accident.  \n\nYour father and your step mother are absolutely terrible though. I cannot fathom trying to hold my children against their own mother after all of that. You are absolutely in your right to not invite your father and his wife to your graduation. Your sister has already chosen her side & alienated her mother, that\u2019s on her, not you.   \n\nPlease don\u2019t feel bad about this. You\u2019re not hurting her, she\u2019s hurting you. She knows you\u2019re no contact with your dad/step mom, she knows you\u2019re with your mother. Yet she\u2019s the one who\u2019s trying to put down the rules for your own graduation. Do not feel bad, she has chosen her path.", "NTA. Your mom is your real family.

I can understand not having a connection to a mother you never knew, but she is a grown person who knows the situation, who renounced her mother because her mother is disabled. they are despicable", "NTA. Your graduation. Your guestlist. She made the ultimatum. She got the answer.", "NTA. Your sister doesn't get to tell you who you need to invite to your graduation.  She is the one hurting you by refusing to acknowledge your mother.  Your father and his wife are disgusting people and you are doing the right thing cutting their toxicity out of your life.  Unfortunately due to their influence on your sister you may find that you need to take a step back from her too until she is older.  It sounds like she needs extensive counselling to sort out all the damage your father & his wife have done to her.", "NTA, your dad is an awful person", "Tell her one day, especially if she ever has children of her own, she might realise the reality of everything they\u2019ve put your Mom through, and then she\u2019ll regret her part in it all. They stole an injured woman\u2019s child and turned her against her Mother. That\u2019s truly evil.", "NTA.  Your dad and his wife are horrible.  There is always enough love for blended families unless AH are involved, like your dad and his 2nd wife.  Good on you, congrats on graduation!", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t have your sister at your graduation but DO NOT back down on your dad & his wife. If you cave now to keep the relationship with your sister, you\u2019ll be giving in forever.

You made hers. Now after all this time and change she\u2019s insisting you change things for her needs. Listen\u2026 never apologize for doing what\u2019s best for you.", "NTA. This is not something that should even be an issue. Your sperm donor and his wife did something horrible to you and your mother and you have every right to not want them anywhere near you. If your sister cannot see and recognize that, then it\u2019s a shame but it\u2019s not your fault. And you don\u2019t have to relinquish your boundaries to please her on YOUR day of celebration. I hope you and your mother have a great day and congratulations.", "Nope; she comes alone (or with a friend) or she doesn't come. This isn't about her or her pretend mother; it's your day.", "NTA", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA your sister needs therapy (you probably also, but not for that reason)", "NTA. My sympathies. Your graduation should with be the people who truly love, support and respect you. Your sister, and definitely her parents are not it. Might be time to put further distance with your sister if she is only focused on what she wants rather than your big day", "Info: have you ever talked with your sister about the real story? Explained how it all feels to you especially with the comments your uncle heard?", "NTA. Enjoy celebrating with your mom\u2014you both deserve that. Congratulations on your graduation.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for all you\u2019ve been through. Don\u2019t give into your sister. If you do it will teach her she can manipulate you the same way your father manipulated both of you. The fact that she\u2019s not even an adult and is pulling this shit is pretty abhorrent as it speaks to the kind of toxicity your father and step mother have bred in their household. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with drawing this boundary and telling your sister you love her and will always be there for her but just as you respect her decision to not see your mother, she needs to respect your decision to not see your father. \n\nCongrats on your graduation and best wishes on your future studies.", "Nta. Don\u2019t engage with her, it\u2019s not a debate, She has no say. She either comes or she doesn\u2019t. If it was me I would just go nc.", "NTA but either is your sister.  She was 3 yo when the accident happened and you were 6 yo.  She probably doesn\u2019t remember much, if anything, about your mom.  That isn\u2019t her fault at all.  Then for 4 more years your Dad and SM \u201cerased\u201d your Mom, the issue is that you were old enough to have memories/connection, unfortunately your sister did not have the memories/connection.  To  a 6yo she was a stranger and one with disabilities that may have frightened her.  Again NOT her fault.  You were 9yo and saw past everything and saw you Mom.  \n\nYour sister formed a bond with your SM especially since that is who was her caregiver/parent during the formative years.  Your sister is wanting to heal her \u201cbroken\u201d family - that is her perspective.  \n\nI would suggest therapy for you because your anger is towards the wrong person - your sister.  The anger should be towards your Dad and SM ONLY.  They are the AH here.  \n\nAs for your graduation- let her know that you will miss her but you respect her feelings and her choice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
