I was 4 at the time and she was 1. Two years later our mom was in a horrific car accident that changed our lives forever. My father was already married again at the time and they made the decision, him and his wife, to have her take over and \"raise us as their own children together\" even though my mom did nothing wrong and was technically still alive, just critically ill. My mom was left permanently disabled by her injuries and she was in hospital for almost a year and spent a further 3ish years in rehabilitation learning how to function again. During all this my sister and I were not allowed to see or speak to our mom and in this time my sister decided that my father's wife was her real mother and that mom was just \"dad's ex wife\" which was encouraged by him and his wife.\n\nMom was able to get to a place where she could ask the court for time with us. It started out supervised because of her disability and the time it had been since we had seen her. But the damage was done with my sister and her. My sister did not want to spend time with her, did not want her called mom. She would yell at me for hugging mom or calling her mom and would say I was \"hurting our mom\". It crushed mom. It crushed her in a way I still remember at that young age. It also made me very angry at my father and his wife.\n\nThe custody situation was fought back against by my father and his wife, who said mom's place in our lives interrupted our stability and family dynamic. We had to speak to many therapists and a GAL of the courts, I was spoken to by a social worker and the judge on the case. In the end it was decided that it was in my best interest to see my mom, and have a relationship with her, but that it was in my sister's best interest not to and to have things go back to the way they were (no contact with mom) for her. Mom was heartbroken and my father was furious that mom would get access to me.\n\nToday I am 18, in my senior year of high school and I now live with my mom and have cut off my father and his wife. I still talk to my sister but our relationship is very strained. We no longer feel like sisters. We almost feel like stepsiblings, because we do not claim the same parents anymore. That includes my father. She has talked about graduation and how she wants to be there. But she doesn't want to go with mom. She wants her parents there. I do not want them there. I do not want them in my life at all. She said she can't come otherwise. I told her I would not invite her parents just to have her there. I could hear her cry after I said it and she was mad at me for picking mom over \"my real family\".\n\nI feel bad. Despite how messed up this all is, I still love my sister, even though I'm not sure we can ever be close again.

Your father and his wife sound like truly terrible people, taking advantage of an accident to steal his ex's children from her... whoof! I can see why you cut them off. Presumably your sister knows all this as well, and is just siding with them because they're the only family she knows. Even so, I'd let her know that she has an invite, her parents don't, and if they can figure out a way to make that work you'd love to see her.

The fact that she\u2019s not even an adult and is pulling this shit is pretty abhorrent as it speaks to the kind of toxicity your father and step mother have bred in their household. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with drawing this boundary and telling your sister you love her and will always be there for her but just as you respect her decision to not see your mother, she needs to respect your decision to not see your father. \n\nCongrats on your graduation and best wishes on your future studies.", "Nta. Don\u2019t engage with her, it\u2019s not a debate, She has no say. She either comes or she doesn\u2019t. If it was me I would just go nc.", "NTA but either is your sister.  She was 3 yo when the accident happened and you were 6 yo.  She probably doesn\u2019t remember much, if anything, about your mom.  That isn\u2019t her fault at all.  Then for 4 more years your Dad and SM \u201cerased\u201d your Mom, the issue is that you were old enough to have memories/connection, unfortunately your sister did not have the memories/connection.  To  a 6yo she was a stranger and one with disabilities that may have frightened her.  Again NOT her fault.  You were 9yo and saw past everything and saw you Mom.  \n\nYour sister formed a bond with your SM especially since that is who was her caregiver/parent during the formative years.  Your sister is wanting to heal her \u201cbroken\u201d family - that is her perspective.  \n\nI would suggest therapy for you because your anger is towards the wrong person - your sister.  The anger should be towards your Dad and SM ONLY.

Its double shitty that your father took the advantage to alienate you both from her while she was at her weakest and could not do anything. Its breaks my heart thinking she was in that hospital bed hanging on to life and not being able to see the girls she carried, birthed, and loved because of another one's spite.\n\nYour sister is not a little girl anymore; maybe one day if she has a child; she can really reflect and think about placing herself in her bio-mom situation and how it would feel if she lost her daughter or son like your mom did. Maybe than, her heart will soften on your mother's situation. \n\nShe is never going think of your mom as her real mom but what I don't understand is why she cannot view it as having two moms instead of just flat out rejecting her completely. Until then, I don't think there is anything you can say or do that would change her mind.", "Well I really hope your sister never has a child then is hospitalised for a year while some other woman steals her child.

I feel sorry for your little sister too, this all seems like it would be pretty traumatic.\n\nI can\u2019t believe how cruel your dad and his current wife have been, like I can, but I can fathom thinking that way. It takes a special kind of cruel to wish someone would die because it would make their \u201cperfect family\u201d picture easier, it takes a special kind of cruel in general.

You have to be harsh and honest, put the mirror in front of her and let her face the reality of her awful actions. Because, yes, the moment she turned 14 she began her transition into a young adult, and should be held accountable for her actions too. Soon she\u2019ll get no do overs nor passes, so it\u2019s better for her to get used to that now whilst she has those privileges. \n\nIf she is not willing to face reality, tell her you\u2019ll be there for her whenever she chooses to wake up and see her parents for the garbage they are. \nIf she (god forbid) agrees with what they did to her, then tell her she should seek therapy on her own. She clearly has a mental disorder in that case, and needs all the help she can get. \n\nIt is not normal for a teen to discover they were forcibly taken from her dying mom and be ok with the waste of air that took her from mom. She either has a form of Stockholm syndrome or another mental disorder that those vile demons gave to her to keep her obedient and blind for them. \n\nI really hope your sister is freed from the horrible torment those two have put her through.", "Bless you for staying true to your mom.

Karma is a Bitch but you are an amazing daughter and now women. Stay strong on your journey.", "OP your story made me remember a terribly similar story. Effectively, in this case, your sperm donor and his wife 'kidnapped' you from your mother for years to attempt alienation. Meanwhile [this story](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-bn04found112540-found-2009feb04-htmlstory.html), the grandparents didn't like the parents were moving and taking their grandchildren away. So while the parents were finishing up plans for the move and were going to return(after an agreed upon few weeks if I remember right), the grandparents thought up a way to keep the grandchildren indefinitely. They accused the parents of satan worship and sexual abuse against the children. They coached the kids, and since this happened during the Satanic Panic, there was a lot of social agitation at the idea of \"satanists\" hunting and hurting children (for an example, see West Memphis Three).\n\nAs they worked through the system trying to get their children back, it was discovered the grandparents were slowly and systematically emptying their home until one day they just weren't home with the grandchildren they retained temporary custody of. They went missing for 20 years. Even now, both children have decided to not talk to their parents or anyone, fully believing the story they were told about their parents.\n\nI'm not saying it's an impossible situation. But maybe while your sister is still young, and might listen, I'd show her everyone's opinions here, and also once you read more into the story, maybe tell her about it, because what happened to you is not terribly different to what her parents are doing to her right now.\n\nEDIT: [More information than the link provided earlier](https://www.middletennesseemysteries.com/article/474/rutherford-county-christi-and-bobby-baskin#:~:text=The%20Missing%20Persons,abduction%20as%20Mark%20attended%20seminary)", "Her reality was *shaped* by her dad and stepmom since she was 3.

In fact I wouldn't be at all surprised if, because OP is NC and they can't get at her directly anymore, they were at home crying crocodile tears at or around LS so they can continue to emotionally manipulate OP through her. Which sucks for both OP and LS. But I think, OP, you're going to have to learn to set firm boundaries with LS as well, and that might mean she chooses them over you just as she did over your mom. If the two of you can afford it and she's willing, some family therapy for just the two of you might help with this, even if it's to agree to disagree. But either way, it's not feasible to allow her to emotionally blackmail you in this way. This is a fight they may continue to wage your whole life. Weddings, births, holidays, birthdays, etc. It's not fair or right but it's important you learn to set your boundaries hard and firm now.", "[deleted]", "It's like you pulled all my emotions and thoughts out of my brain and wrote them down, better than I ever could.   1000% to everything you said.", "My mind protected me from some pretty severe abuse, I was watching some true crime show and it triggered a bunch of memories for me. \n\nIt was devastating for me and I almost didn't survive it.

I hope you are in therapy, if so, ask your therapist how you can handle situations like this. \n\nIt will be a lot of work on your part, so be sure you want to do the work to have your sister in your life. There is no shame if it's too much.", "Honestly, it's not even a coping mechanism. She was one. She has zero memories of her biological mother as anything other than \"strange woman who tried to forcibly insert herself into my life.\" As far as the sister is concerned step-mom is the only mother she has ever had and known. \n\nDad and stepmom are vile people, but sister was either 4 or 5 when mom showed back up in her life she wasn't/was barely old enough to understand that mommy wasn't mommy. \n\nOOP was 4, would have had vague memories of mom, and would have been 7-8 and fully capable of understanding what went down. \n\nYes, sister has been brainwashed and lied to, but her reality has always been that stepmom IS mom. It's horrible, but totally understandable that she sees actual mom as an interloper.\n\nHer parents probably didn't even have to put much, if any effort into winding her up in more recent years. This random lady showed up when she was 4-5 and basically traumatized her by trying to insist she was mom and deserved to see her. It's pretty understandable that she'd hate this woman as a tween and teenager because the woman terrified her as a child. \n\nNo, absolutely none of that is fair to actual mom. Actual mom should probably sue the snot out of dad for parental alienation. But there's a reason the courts decided it wasn't beneficial for the sister to see her. \n\nFrom the sister's perspective Mom showing up is no different than a situation where a kid has been adopted, doesn't know it, and then bio mom shows up on the doorstep one day and announces she wants her kid back. Aside from the legal issues (which means nothing to a little child) that's effectively what happened. Instant removal of all stability in life. \n\nThat said, OOP should keep the ex-parents away from her. If sis can't come because she's 15 and can't travel alone, that's fine.

Then they realised they weren't being disloyal to me if they accepted her and suddenly she was well loved.\n\nKids don't want to upset their parents and do what they think will make them happy in this case that was not seeing her bio mum.

Just because you don't actively and consciously remember it doesn't mean it doesn't leave a mark in your psyche.\n\nMy reasoning for calling it a coping mechanism is her reaction to the mom, even to this day. First, the mom never imposed herself, at least from what is told here. And the fact that, to this day, eve' being at the same event (not talking or even assuredly seeing the mom) triggers such a meltdown tends to lead towards a psychological hinderance.

My situation was quite different from yours but my sister and I had a very similar dynamic at those ages. I realized pretty early on that trying to get my sister to understand how our lived experiences were very different was futile, we were in two different realities that clashed in a way she couldn't and still can't accept. We really didn't talk from when I was 14-19 and she was 16-21. Eventually in my early 20s we started to sorta have a relationship again and would talk a few times a year but  my sister is the way she is and some of her behaviors I will not tolerate because I've learned I deserve better than that.

At this point you have set a healthy boundary for yourself (proud of you) and if your sister refuses to respect that boundary so be it.

Your dad and stepmom sound like absolute monsters. This really hurt my heart for your mom. I'm glad you decided to put her first. There is a special place in hell for people like your dad and stepmom. NTA OP. Not even a little bit.", "I am rarely on Reddit, and seldom comment-but your post really moved me to add a comment. I\u2019ve been reading through some of your later replies, getting a better picture of the situation, and first of all I have to say that you seem a very mature, kind, compassionate, and intelligent young woman, and I applaud your choice to not have your father and stepmother attend your graduation according to the wishes of your sister. It is clear to me, as it should be to your sister, that you love her very much. You have gone out of your way to understand the place that she is coming from. But understanding goes both ways, and it\u2019s time for her to begin to understand the place that you are coming from. I agree with one of the previous commenters, that this would challenge her years of brainwashing at the hands of your father and stepmother. So that makes her not accept your reality, and direct her anger and pain at you. \n\nYou did not create the situation, and when you think about it, even if your mother was not your mother, how does it make sense that the only reason she has been kept away from both of you is because she is disabled? I happen to be disabled myself, and I fail to understand how physical and cognitive differences make your mother any sort of \u2018unsafe\u2019 person to visit with. The world has learned to view disabled people as somehow threatening, or dangerous, or \u2018to be avoided\u2019. The court\nseemed highly biased against disability here-and in terms of your father and stepmother, it seems they used it as an excuse to not have to share you and your sister with their own mother\u2026who sounds like a beautiful woman, by the way. She has been through so much. And so have you. I admire and appreciate the way you have not let her differences stand in the way, and have embraced her as your mother. At a time where she needed more support, your father and stepmother not only withdrew theirs, but stole her children away from her. I can\u2019t imagine anything more cruel. I\u2019m sure this has impacted her recovery process... from injuries that she never chose to have.\n\nWhen I read that they were actually hoping your mother would die\u2026 my God, that\u2019s despicable-and I applaud you for cutting them out of your life. \n\nI had a different situation growing up, with my sister, where my sister (older) could not accept that my father was abusive, including sexually. It played out in such a way in my life that it created years of struggle, for which I was always blamed. No one, including my sister, could acknowledge the truth except me. It created a years-long divide between my sister and me. Now that my parents have passed away, my sister and I are slowly reestablishing our relationship, although difficult topics have yet to come up. In your situation, it may be that there will be a divide between you and your sister, but there is also be a chance for that to change, in the future. You have not chosen this divide, your sister has. And as much as you can understand her denial, and still love her, you also need to preserve your own mental health. Your choice to keep distance from your father and his wife, and not be pressured by your sister to see them, could not be any more right. I commend you for making this wise but difficult choice at such a young age, although I know it is very painful. But you can\u2019t have a real relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t respect or accommodate what YOU need to feel safe, and sane. I realize she is younger, and that this may take time for her to comprehend. But in the meantime, you still need to make the safest and healthiest choices for yourself.

OP was old enough to not fall victim to it as easily. And that\u2019s what the sister is: a victim. Just like her mother and OP.

It is reasonable that your sister is not comfortable going someplace with just your mother, whom she barely knows, rather than with the parents she's familiar with.\n\nAs for your dad and stepmom, they had a rough row to hoe.  They didn't expect to suddenly get custody of a three and six year old.  Your mother was in the hospital for a year, and rehab three more years - opportunities for visitation were limited, and it might well have been traumatic for you and your sister to see her in the first year or two - people don't need a year of hospitalization, plus three years rehab, unless the condition is very, very dire.  \n\nThey had to simultaneously plan for what to do if your mother recovered,  if your mother survived but didn't recover enough to care for the two of you, and if she died.  They had no great options, and clearly made mistakes, but the options they could offer were probably better than if the two of you wound up in the foster care system, which was probably a real possibility.\n\nIt may well take years of therapy (starting with individual therapy) for you and your sister to fully sort out this complex and horrific situation with an adult understanding.

Visits could have been facilitated much earlier, though, and they should have known she was progressing in recovery; a significant part of the gap in contact was because she had to recover enough to be able to sue for access.", "Maybe it's time to decide on clear, defined boundaries with her.\n\nIn order to have a relationship with each other as sisters, it means neither of you could involve your respective parents.\n\nAs upsetting, frustrating, and hurtful it is to have her try to force her parents into your life, she probably feels the same or similar enough.\n\nSo, you'd both need to respect that boundary. And it would be difficult, even if you both were adults fully independent of your parents. Tell her that you are both hurting each other right now, and it's not good for either of you. So if she can't stop herself from crossing this essential boundary, you need to do what's best for you because she chooses not to respect your choice. \n\nShe doesn't have to like it. But she has to respect it in order to maintain a good relationship with you. And you'll do the same for her, because you love her enough to respect her choice and well-being, regardless of your feelings on her parents. But if either party can't do this, some space is safer than continual hurt. Better to be distant than toxic and ending up hating each other. \n\nThis is, sadly, a situation where you can do everything right and still lose. So the best you can do is try to do damage control. \n\nBut you can find new ways to grow and find happiness. Just because this doesn't work out how you hope doesn't mean everything is doomed forever. I wish you and your mom the absolute best, OP. And congrats on graduating!", "It will be listed as an amended birth certificate, and the original will still be on file with the state health department. This happens even in a closed adoption. The court would have had to terminate the mother's rights for the adoption to go through (possible, but they *did* make dad bring both kids to mom at first), so more than likely, they just *say* stepmom is mom. While I wouldn't put it past the two to have gotten a petition through, I could see them not having stepmom adopt her too.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry your sister can\u2019t see she\u2019s being manipulated and weaponized", "NTA, this seems so bizarre. How do they justify their actions to themselves? Haven't they ever thought the same thing could easily happen to them, and how devastating it would be? Especially the step mom, I was a cruel kid, and would have spent years reminding her of how easily she could be replaced by her husband. I hope one day your sister is able to open her eyes, and see what was stolen from her. But set whatever boundaries you feel would be best with her. It isn't your job to fix her, or make yourself unhappy for her sake.", "NTA. You didn't create this.", "NTA, but your sister isn't either.  Your step-parents are, definitely.", "NTA it\u2019s not like your mom chose to not be in you lives she was Ill, your sister shouldn\u2019t hold o. To resentment for that.

And you didn't hurt your sister, she did it all by herself.", "[removed]", "NTA.\n\nActions have consequences and hers happen to be not getting what she wants because it is NOT ABOUT HER.\n\nThis is your life and your choice is to UNDERSTAND AND SEE the truth your sister refuses to. That is entirely on her. She has already hurt you with her actions and believes that SHE is right. That her way in the ONLY way.\n\nShe has made her choices and now has to live with them whether she likes it or not. Unless she changes her perspective to the TRUTH then your relationship with always be like this or get worse.\n\nWorse only because SHE will attempt to shovel her point of view down your throat until you have had enough.\n\nShe has no control over you nor your choices or decisions.\n\nI can completely understand she is young but she is old enough to know the truth and still wants to believe the lie. \n\nThat the illusion was her way of coping however it doesn't justify her making demands of you for YOUR graduation. Especially knowing how you feel about your father and his wife.", "NTA. Maybe write your sister a long message or letter explaining your feelings about what her parents did and question how she\u2019d react if she was in the situation your mom is in. Almost urging her to view it from a different perspective. \n\nAlso, I know she\u2019s only 15 but maybe go NC for a little bit, at least until after your grad. It sound like her loyalty to her parents is weighing on you heavily and you also need a break from that. Just enjoy some stress-free time with your mom and celebrate your milestone.\n\nI hope your sister eventually comes around and you all can properly heal", "This is all awful, OP. What dad and his new wife did is unconscionable. They could have chosen to take you and your sister to visit your mom, to encourage her recovery, but instead chose to be toxic, controlling, and awful. I'm so glad that you were able to maintain a relationship with your mom. \n\nIf it helps, view your sister as brain washed. She was too little to really remember your mom, and dad really took advantage of that. When your mom came back into your lives it likely just panicked your sister, a woman she didn't know wanting to be a major part of her life was scary. And, while she may not have remembered your mom, her brain remembered the trauma of losing her. Which helped make her cling to dad's lies because she couldn't stand to lose anyone else. But, she's growing up now and she's going to have to take ownership of this. She doesn't get to demand that her parents attend your graduation. She doesn't get to demand they attend anything. I think you'll have to be very clear that she either attends events by herself, or she'll have to miss out. You absolutely do not need to invite her toxic, awful parents.\n\nYou're definitely NTA.", "Dude that is so sad. I'm sorry this happened to you. It would be easier if she had up and left on you guys, or been killed or something. It would make the situation sweet or endearing, but instead it just seems like she really blamed your Mom for the accident. Probably never had any time to process it, with how fast things happened. \n\nMaybe some of it was just a way to get back to normal quicker? Maybe even genuine affection, but it seems your Dad and Step Mom did nothing to encourage objectivity or dealing with having a parent seriously injured. When you add to the whole \"new step mom\" dynamic to the mix, that is a lot to take in. \n\nIt is your graduation, and it is supposed to be about your achievement not a place where she can play \"which parent I love the most\" or otherwise virtue signal by not inviting your Mom. \n\nCONGRATS ON YOUR GRADUATION!", "Your sister is old enough to learn that her actions have consequences and you are simply helping her learn this very important life lesson.

You need to let her know how you feel also.", "NTA and you're sister is also NTA. Your father and step are GIANT fuckin assholes though.\n\nAt the end of the day, you're an adult and its your day.

It's much easier to do to a child and not as simple as you make it out to be when you're talking about a young, growing, developing brain. OP's younger sister knows on some level what reality is; her brain is protecting her from the trauma of what her father and stepmother did because she is incapable of dealing with the massive fallout of that right now. Denial is a protective mechanism and you should remember she is *FIFTEEN,* still a child.", "Had the father not been a complete dick and allowed the mother to be part of her children's lives it wouldn't have been traumatic.", "Oh you\u2019re right.

She\u2019s wrong, but she was influenced and manipulated since she was a little kid.

All the shittiness aside, your graduation guests are there *for you*. Your sister doesn't get to demand you invite someone you are no contact with because she wants them there - it's not her event! If she doesn't want to come, that's her choice, but it's pretty clear that she's using this as an opportunity to manipulate you.
