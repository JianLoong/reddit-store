I basically told him I hated him and I stopped talking to him and ignored him during visitation time until he stopped coming.

Liars don't get the privilege of being mad at the person who unmasks them when if they'd never told a lie to begin with, they wouldn't find themselves in their present circumstances.\n\nAlso, I would argue the boys deserve to know the truth because if they at any point in their life decide they want a relationship with you in future, that relationship needs to start from a foundation of honesty.\n\nThe same goes for if you ever decide to re-establish a relationship with your father and his partner.

If your Gran or anyone else in your family brings it up, tell them that you made one request of your father and he blindsided you by doing the one thing you asked him not to. Then you where cornered with the lies that your father and fathers wife had told the children,making your mom out to be the bad one. No wonder you exploded,i would have done the same. If anything,your dad ows you an apology for his lies and if his side of the family keeps pushing for one from you (including your dad) i would seriously consider if i really want them in my life.

His sons refuse to talk to him because he left the country to get away from his ex (he wanted to take them with him but the ex wouldn't allow it and they ended up in foster care, for which they blame HIM).

I've been SO tempted to tell those sons about their mother and why everything went to shit there.\n\nIn all, OP - you are NTA. The asshole is your father who brought Family 2.0 along to your meeting for lunch, which was an emotional dynamite situation already. He lit the fuse by having them there. It was a stupid miscalculation on his part but I cannot say that he didn't deserve the outcome. He showed once again that he wasn't trustworthy.
