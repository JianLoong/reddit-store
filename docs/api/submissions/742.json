Liars don't get the privilege of being mad at the person who unmasks them when if they'd never told a lie to begin with, they wouldn't find themselves in their present circumstances.\n\nAlso, I would argue the boys deserve to know the truth because if they at any point in their life decide they want a relationship with you in future, that relationship needs to start from a foundation of honesty.\n\nThe same goes for if you ever decide to re-establish a relationship with your father and his partner.

You were quite right to tell your siblings that \u2018that isn\u2019t what happened\u2019 or something like that.\n\nBut in your rage and bitterness at your father, you snapped at two innocent children, aged 12 and 10, that their \u2018father is a cheater\u2019 and they\u2019re products of an affair. That\u2019s not age-appropriate and it was motivated purely out of spite. You wanted to hurt those children because *your* family was destroyed and they get to grow up with a picture-perfect one.\n\nYou could have said, \u2018That isn\u2019t the truth. Dad decided he wanted to be with your mom instead of mine, so he abandoned me.\u2019 That puts the blame squarely on your father.

You spent a lot of space saying you \u2018don\u2019t miss him\u2019 etc and then proceeded to demonstrate that you are still deeply wounded by what he did. You are very jealous of your half-siblings, because you \u2018made a scene\u2019 at them; you held it together after your father\u2019s actions.\n\nYou need to admit that to yourself, and start to break the cycle. And sometimes that means acknowledging that even something isn\u2019t our fault, it\u2019s still our responsibility. Yes, you were absolutely an asshole to snap at an innocent 10-year-old, \u2018No, I don\u2019t visit because your father was a cheater.\u2019 It was vindictive and immature. \n\nDo I blame you? No. Would I have probably done the same? Yes. Was it right? No. Let\u2019s be clear, the person who caused this situation is your father. But you deserve to be told that lashing out at a 10-year-old wasn\u2019t right. You deserve better than to be eaten up inside with hatred like this. Why do you think your grandma was crying? You\u2019ve said you don\u2019t miss him and then you behave like this.\n\nWhat happened to you is unforgivable, being hit with something like that as a little girl when you\u2019re unable to process it is going to cause you huge problems regulating your emotions. As in this scenario. What you did will only hurt you further in the long run. You deserve better.\n\nI have to say ESH, with the greatest sympathy.", "ESH\n\nThat was a very shitty way to deliver some very hurtful news. OF COURSE you are an asshole for lashing out at a kid.

I have had drama with my dad but I am waiting for my half siblings to turn 18 before explaining it to them. The way I see it, I don't like the parents on that side of the family but my siblings deserve to have their own relationship with them while growing up. \n\nI can't decide if your grandma was an AH for trying to force you to reconnect with your dad or not. She's from an older generation of course so she probably has different ideas about family. I can get why she would be sad about how things turned out between you too.

As someone who had a very similar family situation and continued to go and visit my dads second family, I wish I made the decision like you did to not see that other family. It is very painful and I wish I had the balls like you did! He violated your boundaries and messed up his one chance at having a relationship with you. OP, your mom\u2019s response was exactly right. You just told the truth and there is nothing wrong with that. Your dad did not think about your feelings when he cheated and it is not your responsibility to help them maintain their charade.", "They ambushed OP and its hard to control the horse once you open the barn door.", "Yep. He didnt respect your boundaries so why tf did he think YOU would respect his? He knew you couldnt refuse meeting them in public so he pulled this stunt as leverage. Didn't quite work out though because now his kids know the truth.", "I agree, dad had no right to bring the woman who broke up your family. What did he tell her that you wanted to get to know them? Now everyone is upset when you were perfectly happy with no relationship at all.
