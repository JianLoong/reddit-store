It's hardly a tradition when the dress has been worn twice and either way you're the bride so you bet to decide your own dress.", "NTA  your mom wore her mom's dress. That does not make it a tradition. Remember this when you get married. Your mom will try to control your wedding to make it HER wedding. In meantime,  avoid this subject.

That's a very new tradition then, not in years, but in number of times it applies...twice... That's more of a coincidence than a tradition. And why does she think your new dress would be immodest? Just because it's white? That's a bit bonkers. Tell Mum you would like to try the dress, but to be more modest, can you get it dyed blue, like the purity of the ocean on a summer's day? Beware OP, she's going to want to control other things about your wedding too. I wonder if her own wasn't exactly how she'd dreamt it, so yours will fulfil her desires, not yours?", "It is your day, so wear what you want.\n\nBut if your Mom is paying for the wedding, you might consider giving the dress a nod; that is, after (or before) the ceremony, pose for some photos in the dress.  \n\nI agree with what another poster wrote; that is, be careful you do not allow your mother to make your wedding day her day because that will be the tip of the iceberg (e.g., what you name your kids, where you live, how often you visit, etc.).\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  \n\n2 people wore it, hardly a tradition.

You could also weave some of the dress into your bouquet.", "NTA, and even if it is \"tradition,\" you are not required to follow it. A wedding dress is a personal choice.

I believe it is still possible to buy a wedding dress that isn't \"immodest\". The ones I have seen recently all covered the brides bits quite nicely.

Mom can get over the fact it's your day and your choice", "No you are not the AH.  You should get to choose your dress and everything else about your wedding, you and SO, do the deciding.  To appease your mother maybe use that old dress to make the veil or train for your dress if possible, so to include a bit of tradition.  Maybe ask for a sentimental piece of jewelry to be used as family tradition going forward.  Jewelry would last much longer than a dress.  Styles do change over time so wanting a dress style more to your more modern taste is not, and should not, be a problem.  Remind your mother who the bride is, you, not her.

I remember as recently as the 90s, people would tut-tut about your virginity status if you wore off-white. It's more recently that almost all dresses have started being off-white because they just plain look better on most people.

Just curious, your mother said wearing the dress was \"a tradition.\" How? Have ALL the girls in family worn it? Or did she mean that your Grandma wore it, so your Mom wore and now she wants YOU to wear it? Because, if that is the case, it's NOT a tradition. It's gaslighting to guilt you into wearing it. \n\nNow, if others have worn it, then she may have a point. But, that doesn't mean you are required to wear it, either.

You may also be able to come up with a compromise that works for both you and your mom.\n\nMaybe you could take the dress to a seamstress along with a few dress ideas/pictures of what you like and see they may be able to use your Grandma's dress and tailor it to the dream dress you want while keeping the base and some of detail work to show your combining of the traditional and new life.", "NTA.

And since it doesn't sound like you are engaged this is an odd thing for her to be picking a fight over.  But.......\n\nIt is your wedding day and you get to decide what you wear.\n\nIt is nice when people use a dress that has family tradition behind it but it doesn't always work.  Maybe when the time comes would she be open to you altering the dress and maybe wearing it for the Rehearsal Dinner or Bridal Shower?  It might be a compromise.   But if you aren't currently planning a wedding in the near future I wouldn't make commitments about anything.
