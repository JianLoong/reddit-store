I just wanted to throw the idea out in case maybe the idea never crossed anyones mind", "A one-generation 'tradition' isn't a tradition.\n\nIt's your wedding, subject to your whims not anyone else's.\n\nNTA", "Nope. I didn\u2019t even read your post yet but I don\u2019t think ANY PONY is an A** for not wearing their mother\u2019s dress. It\u2019s all about the Bride AND Groom. Not you and your sentimental keepsakes. Being involved in the wedding, maybe asking if the bride or groom would like to wear something small like jewelry, having a night together sharing your love. It\u2019s not ANY PONY\u2019S choice but their own. Going into their special day they want to look good and feel good about what they\u2019ve chosen to present themselves to the important people in their life. \nSo..\nOnce again.\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong. \nI\u2019ll read your post now.", "The dress was passed down and re-worn ONE time.\n\nThat's not a \"tradition.\"   That's a hand-me-down.\n\nNTA.", "Sorry mom, but what you want is not as important as what I want at MY wedding.", "That friend MUST existbon AITA...otherwise how could OP question her thinking?", "My grandmother gave me her veil to cut up (her words) and tie around my bouquet. Luckily for me, I eloped without a bouquet because the veils lace and netting were so old they just fel apart.\n\n\nMy point is, there are so many ways to incorporate a family heirloom into your wedding \"look\"", "Could be just agreeing with OP's mom because of 'keep the peace' crap.  We females are raised to do this, some it's gotten a more bitter hold of then others."]}
