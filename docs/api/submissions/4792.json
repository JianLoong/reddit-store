She is an AH", "NTA. You don't just agree to pitch in to a joint purchase, and then pull out when it's time to pay up. She bailed with no good reason and left the rest of you footing the bill. Conflict with the step siblings aside, she's willing to do that to *her* own sister, and your mom should not have dismissed it. \n\nI'm not sure there's much you can do to get your sister to make it right, especially since your mother has decided to play favorites. So personally, I think the difference should come out of your budget for your sister's gifts for the next year or so.", "nta your sis may be younger than you all but she needs to get a fucking grip. how are you gonna show off your money but then look stupid like that? in my city we say that what she did is \u201ccacarsi la faccia\u201d which means \u201cget your face dirty with poop\u201d. she\u2019s 18. she should\u2019ve known better.\n\nbtw i can\u2019t really blame your mom for how she acted. she couldn\u2019t really tell her to spend those extra money, since it was for her own gift. she probably felt like she had her hands tied and offered you the money bc she knows that you and your step siblings are in the right. your mom probably was afraid your sister could get mad at her because \u201cyou expect me to pay extra money to get you a gift? after all the money i already spent on you?\u201d\n\nso yeah, sister is the asshole, maybe mom is too, but i kinda feel for her", "NTA\n\nYou are in the middle here. Step kids can be expected to come out strong, because your sister is being a selfish AH. She shouldn't have agreed to contribute if she couldn't. A polite, \"I am sorry I can't go in with you all on that because I already spent my holiday budget on other things.\" Would have been perfectly appropriate. \n\nPersonally, if she gave me a gift this Christmas I would hand it back to her and say, \"I love you and appreciate the thought but until you pay back, (stepbrother) for the cost of our parents gift you promised to contribute toward, I really can't accept gifts in good conscience. Can you return this and pass the money towards what you owe?\".", "NTA.  Definitely.  but I'm not sure why you framed this as siding with step siblings over your bio sister.

Was she pressured into it, when she already got other gifts for them? And she brags about it? How so? Is she telling you shat she bought and holding it over your head? Or is she just excited about what she was able to get her parents as a gift and you just got uncomfortable because you can\u2019t do the same?  \n\nShe is, unfortunately, the ahole in this situation because she left you and your step siblings hanging. \n\nThis behavior, however, could stem from her putting up boundaries (with awful timing) as you\u2019re accusing her of \u201cbragging\u201d about her money, when she might just be excited about being able to give back to her parents.", "NTA. \n\n> We picked something right at the top of our budgets cause we love our parents and want to do what we can for them. My sister agreed\n\nThat's it right there. As soon as she agreed, she had given her word that she would help you pay.

Bragging about having more money than you when you are struggling isn't right. \n\nShe needs to get off her high horse and do what she agreed to do. It's not your fault she spent too much of her money on them already, she never should've agreed in the first place if she had no intention of spending more.", "NTA \n\nIf you can still cancel the reservations, you need to. As much as you want to treat your parents, it cannot be at the cost of setting yourselves on fire and struggling to make ends meet \n\nI'd also argue that your mother has lost trip privileges and shouldn't be rewarded for enabling your royal ass of a sister", "NTA\n\nYour sister doesn't keep her promise. I can see why you you are angry with her. However your mother seems to be a nice person. I don't think she is siding with anybody and came with an alternative solution. I think your mother just doesn't like trouble in her family.\n\nThe original idea was great. Unfortunately your sister let you down. See it as a lesson for the future.

In the future, your sister doesn't get included in gift calculations unless she's the one fronting the money or she sends the money first. And she might find that your stepsiblings aren't so interested in including her in future gifts- and I can't imagine you're so crazy about it either.\n\nThis time, she just gets her name taken off the gift.

Of course paying the other quarter is wrong, but you should not have involved her in the first place.  How old are you again?  There seems to be bias here, but not from your mother.", "NTA.
