It's unfair for your mom to force you into a situation that you didn't want to be in and then punish you for not speaking. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings, expressing the reasons behind your actions and the need for understanding and support. Your well-being should be a priority, and your mom should recognize and respect that.", "There is a social expectation to glorify the dead, to brush over the past.\n\n Your mom, even though she was publicly trying save face in the situation, should be aware of how deeply hurt by your father - parents usually are but conveniantly ignore it...

The manipulation doesn't work anymore and now not one of our six children talk to him.

Your mother shouldn't have forced you to go.", "NTA. You didn't want to go.  You didn't create a scene.  You just didn't talk.  Your mother had no business punishing you.  You could have talked about how awful your father was.", "NTA. Ask your mom why she is making it so you will want to leave and cut her from your life when you are 18.", "NTA, and taking away your stuffies is so emotionally abusive \ud83d\ude28 You get to feel however you want about your father, and grieve how you want as well.

Do you need them for snuggling and self-soothing? Is there a way we can get you a little one you can hide (in your schoolbag or so...) I'd pick a koala, because they're natural born huggers, but you might prefer another.  \n\n\nI'm definitely sending you a hug!! And if you don't want it right now, you can save it for later, (or never) that's the brilliant thing of digital hugs. ;)", "NTA. In case no one has said it yet - what your mother has done is horribly abusive. This is beyond the pale, emotional abuse. And I can\u2019t imagine this is a one-time thing. It\u2019s hard to recognize this kind of abuse when you\u2019ve never lived away from the parent, and it\u2019s common to play it down or think maybe it\u2019s your fault, but make no mistake: your mother is abusing you by forcing you to attend the funeral, isolating you, taking away things that comfort you (when she claims you should be grieving, no less), punishing you for not mourning someone who abused you, etc.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to experience this. If you have any trusted adults in your life - teachers, uncles, aunts, older cousins, family friends - that you can talk to and get support, please reach out to them. I\u2019m so, so sorry this is happening to you. This is not your fault. You deserve to have your needs listened to and met. As you grow up and get out of her household, I hope you will get the chance to learn how things can be different and better, and to really be able to see by comparison how wrong her behavior is, and how you should never have been treated like this.\n\nAlso, as a side note: these people are willing to dismiss your father\u2019s abuse because of his autism, but not acknowledge that you deserved care and accommodation as a child\u2026who is also autistic? He\u2019s the one that gets the pass? Garbage. Never doubt yourself here - the adults in your life are supposed to take care of you and nurture you. Your parents have failed you, it\u2019s not your fault, and I hope you are able to surround yourself more and more as you grow up with a \u201cchosen family\u201c (people related to you and not related to you) who genuinely care about you, respect you, and meet your needs.\n\nGood luck, I am rooting for you.", "Your mother is living on another planet!\n\nJust because he\u2019s the sperm donor doesn\u2019t entitle him to be eulogized by you? \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad and put your mother in her place so she understands your point of view.", "Take all of that background out, and I would still never force a 16 year old to speak at a funeral.\n\nOr anyone, actually, but it feels worse to force a child.", "NTA. Your father was abusive, your mother was an enabler, and both of them failed you as parents.", "Hi\n\nAutistic female here. Diagnosed at age 22/23. \n\nSo sorry that you went through this. \n\nFemale autistics present usually differently. And we are often dismissed because of it. \n\nYour struggles are real and valid, and so is the abuse you suffered. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA and I\u2019m so sorry your mother is not in your corner on this. Mine is the reason I survived. \n\nSending you all the internet stuffies and hugs", "Wish I could send her some stuffies.\n\nThat part broke my heart."]}
