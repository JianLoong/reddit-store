Autism gives no excuse to be a bad person and you have every right to say nothing at his funeral. I could get the mother getting overly upset because to her that\u2019s her husband but for you that was your father figure that did not act as one, still unacceptable overall.", "My sweet child, you didn't deserve any of this.\n\nI hope you can find some way to sooth yourself right now.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Nothing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This sucks all around. I'm so sorry.", "Bad mothering 101. She's the AH.", "NTA, It's just insane to me why anyone would want someone who has bad blood with the deceased to be at their funeral?\n\nI'd point out to your mom that she insulted both you and dad by doing this she's showing no respect to either of you.\n\nNot speaking was definitely nicer then the alternative of speaking your mind.", "NTA, your mother is a deluded narcissist.", "NTA and you should not have been forced to go. I don\u2019t understand why she forced you or why she is punishing you.

It's unfair for your mom to force you into a situation that you didn't want to be in and then punish you for not speaking. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings, expressing the reasons behind your actions and the need for understanding and support. Your well-being should be a priority, and your mom should recognize and respect that.", "There is a social expectation to glorify the dead, to brush over the past.\n\n Your mom, even though she was publicly trying save face in the situation, should be aware of how deeply hurt by your father - parents usually are but conveniantly ignore it... If not, there needs to be a conversation or even writting a letter to her.", "Your have a bad mom", "NTA your father is more of a sperm donor and a stranger to you. He was a terrible parent. Your mother is even worse for grounding you over something like this. Show her this thread, she should be ashamed of herself.", "I feel so sorry for you to have to deal with this. How dare your mother be this uncaring for your mental health. Shame on her. Hope you find someone to help you through this time. At 16 you have many forks in the road to make choices.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have been forced to go at all.\n\nIt's so annoying when people try to gloss over all the really unpleasant things someone did in life by pretending the opposite at a funeral. \n\nYou were honest in not speaking when you didn't want to.\n\nIt doesn't feel right that your mom is punishing you either. \n\nPlease talk to someone you trust or a school guidance counselor if you need support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
