Particularly if AFRID and/or some kind of neurodivergence is the cause. It\u2019s reasonable for them to want him to feel included, and catering to his diet is a reasonable expectation. It\u2019s also reasonable for them to say \u201cif you won\u2019t make him feel included we\u2019ll exclude ourselves by not coming\u201d. \nEqually, it\u2019s reasonable for you to not be comfortable to provide a specific meal to cater for his diet, and offer to prepare something else he\u2019ll eat. \n\nI think the issue here is probably a difference of opinion on how McDonalds got landed on as the thing he will eat and the perception of McDonalds. If the kid genuinely has AFRID or something, then I get how the parents would give up the fight and settle for McDonalds - a fed kid is best.

If the nephew loved the beef Wellington before then it was kind of OP to suggest making that again, it's not like they are completely not open to providing something different that the kid will like.\n\nOn the other hand, I've definitely told pushy people that were trying to prove a point, that I've liked something as a kid. I told my parents if I really hated it though so it might be the case that the nephew was being polite in the past as a guest, but the mother doesn't want him going all day without food this time.\n\nEveryone has a food they hate though, so OP should consider what it would be like to go to an event and have nothing but that served.

I guess it's difficult when I've only provided a story where she's probably not made the best choice but I still have hundreds of experiences and memories of her being a great big sis and a kind and caring individual. I remember the days in our home when she would block my ears from my parents arguing and tell me fantastical stories about heroines journeying around the world and unicorns with shiny horns and pretty wings. \n\nThis post was not meant to be some deep dive into my sister and I's relationship and I would like to keep it that way. The whole intention was just to ask some trivial question and see if it was valid or not, I never asked for any sister relationship advice and I do not need any because our relationship is fine, hitting a small bump on the road does not in any way symbolize a toxic relationship or that either of us are nasty people.", "Depends on the kid. Mine (6) likes to taste new things, and usually prefers more nutritious food over fast food. Plus kids go hungry earlier in the day than most adults.", "I wasn\u2019t giving general advice.

This is strictly personal affairs and I do not need family to know of this interaction whether she chooses to come or not, because this is not the main focus.\n\nI respect your opinion, but what I said was I didn't want to receive feedback on was any personal relationship advice. Because like it or not, some of your feedback was just analysing that I \"didnt like\" my sister or something. This isn't the relationship advice forum, I literally only needed advice on whether I should have bought them the McDonald's or not, and if I was in the right for asking them to get it on their way or something. I think we should just finish this conversation now as it isn't bringing us anywhere, but thank you for your time.", "She didn't ask your advice on that, she asked about whether she should have grabbed McDonald's or not. It really bothers me when people make judgements that aren't even related to the question. Either play by the rules or just stop.", "I didn\u2019t offer relationship advice. \n\nI only commented on your behaviour during the incident, as you described it. \n\nYou are reading everything into it, but it\u2019s not there.", "It\u2019s within the rules to judge on *the reason* why the act was performed. \n\nContext matters. \n\nOtherwise the answers would be the same for every question - we could just write a list out & there would be nothing to discuss.  \n\nThe reason it\u2019s not always clear is because *context matters*.\n\nETA: if the reason she wasn\u2019t buying it was coz she\u2019s a poor college student already doing into debt for the dinner & literally can\u2019t afford it, then easy NTA.

That\u2019s pretty much all he eats. \n\nWhat\u2019s to explore?", "Honestly, probably nothing. Parents feed their kids that shit because it's easy. My whole point was that you're dissecting their relationship and making a judgement off of that when that wasn't even the question being asked. Even if she did have a low opinion of her sister, that wasn't what she wanted to know. She questioned whether or not she should have grabbed a happy meal."]}
