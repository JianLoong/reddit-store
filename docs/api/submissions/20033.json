Particularly if AFRID and/or some kind of neurodivergence is the cause. It\u2019s reasonable for them to want him to feel included, and catering to his diet is a reasonable expectation. It\u2019s also reasonable for them to say \u201cif you won\u2019t make him feel included we\u2019ll exclude ourselves by not coming\u201d. \nEqually, it\u2019s reasonable for you to not be comfortable to provide a specific meal to cater for his diet, and offer to prepare something else he\u2019ll eat. \n\nI think the issue here is probably a difference of opinion on how McDonalds got landed on as the thing he will eat and the perception of McDonalds. If the kid genuinely has AFRID or something, then I get how the parents would give up the fight and settle for McDonalds - a fed kid is best.

I have learned with my ND kids that when offered in another setting (birthdays, overnight stays, school camps, school lunch, grandparents house) they will at least attempt to try instead of flat out refusing, too such extent that they now eat a lot more different foods.\n\nIt's because at home they expect a certain routine and foods. If you offer them something else it messes with their routines and expectations. But being in other situations helps them to actually try the food, moreso when they can comfortably say they don't like it. (At least with my kids and one has slight AFRID, don't come near her with any kind of legumes, she absolutely hates the texture).\n\nRegardless if they are NT or ND just putting it on the table and make them curious will help them to try new things.. if they are not pressured into eating it though, that's counter productive wether NT or ND.."]}
