I would check out ARFID if you really care, as chicken nuggets seems to be the common denominator in it.", "NTA. If your sister wants her kid to eat that junk, she can pick it up on the way over. She's *way* out of line to make this demand, and is the AH herself.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why your sister thinks that because her child needs to eat food other than what you are preparing it is not her responsibility to get it. Personally, if she\u2019s going to act like a child, then I would be OK with her not coming to my party.", "NTA, your sister needs to stop babying her 8 year old and start introducing him to new foods which is what she should have started in the first place.

You aren't the one that keeps feeding him crap instead of having to be a parent.", "Nta, if she wants her son to eat only McDonald's then she should bring it with her.", "NTA. Why don't they grab the kid his toxic junk food on their way to the BBQ?", "NTA. She is perfectly able to pick up that food if she wishes. \n\nMy youngest son has had a very narrow diet due to sensory issues (he has Autism Spectrum Disorder.)   A speech therapist helped us to come up with a plan on how to introduce new foods with micro-steps to take the anxiety out of things and now he has a lot more variety in his diet.   There is help out there if they need it.", "All this over a five dollar happy meal? You haven't explained why she can't buy it for him on the way", "NTA\n\nAs the host, you decide the menu. Menu requests are a courtesy, not a requirement. A guest can always decline an invitation if they don't like the menu. You're not meddling in her affairs as a parent, she's demanding that you go out of your way to cater to cater to her parenting.", "**NTA**\n\nI have a picky eater the same age. It's frustrating AF. Every time he tries a new food is a small victory. Family parties, we bring a backup plan, paid for by US, but he has to try something new. At the last one, he tried SO much new shit, we didn't even have to use the backup plan. But for real. Why the fuck can't she swing by McDonald's or something herself?! If we're cooking, literally anything, the VERY LAST THING we want to do is go to the store.", "NTA. She can buy that junk on the way to the BBQ.", "ESH if she wants him to have McDonald's, then she can pick it up on the way. \n\nHowever, it's her kid, not yours. She gets to decide what he eats. It is not the diet I would want for my kid, but he's not my kid, so I don't get a vote. Neither do you.", "NTA. They can buy their kids food if the kid won\u2019t eat what\u2019s served. However, the purpose of this event is to celebrate your moms retirement, not to go to the mat on an 8-yr old kid who\u2019s not even your kid\u2019s dietary habits. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many kids out there who changed to become healthy eaters because an Aunt insisted they do so at a family event.", "NTA. \n\nShe insists you buy it? No, absolutely not. She can buy it if he must have it. She seems to want to control you over this. Why?", "NTA.  You\u2019ve identified the menu, elected to make a food you know he will eat and not stopped your over indulgent sister from buying food herself.  If she chooses to deprive you of her wonderful company, so be it.", "My son loves their chips and 1 nugget (he's asd) and he only eats usually about 3-5 foods for months at time so he take vitamins in liquid form (refuses gummy etc) \n\nSo, I noticed it is the happy meal box itself he likes. \n\nI bought a bunch, instead of the \"chips\" I made sweet potato and parsnip and eggplant chips and salted them lightly but made sure they were crunchy and basically couldn't tell colour wise and put them in their medium size as a \"big surprise\" \n\nFor nuggets I used chicken breast and my own healthier batter or sometimes crumb them for the air fryer and put them in the nuggets container. \n\nHe only drinks water and nothing else thankfully. \n\nBut maybe ask them if you can just grab a container and some contents containers and put things you cook in it?? \n\nIf he has liked things you've made and eaten them then obviously he doesn't only eat McDonalds..\n\nSo this way you did go to mc Donalds just got different food? Lol \n\nNta.", "NTA, that kid is going to have heart disease but the time he's 10(over exaggerating). It sounds like they're too lazy to find real food he will eat. Mine is picky too but safe at least expands it more, especially the older she gets.... Anyways, I have been that parent years prior who has either had mine eat before, or if it's close family, brought something mine WILL eat. Your sister is weird.", "NTA. It would be one thing if you refused to allow the McDonald\u2019s at the party, but you\u2019re just not interested in running out to get it and paying for it. Doesn\u2019t it make more logistical sense for her to just stop at a drive through on the way there and get it?", "NTA, it's bbq and you're preparing meat for the bbq. You informed everyone and your sister it's bbq. Your sister should provide the McDonald's for her son if she wants him to have it. That is not your responsibility, it hers and her husband. If she doesn't come for the bbq, she will be buying McDonald's anyway.", "NTA. If *any* guest wants to eat something other than what their host is providing, it is their (or their parents' in this case) obligation to buy it and bring it with them or eat before. You have told your sister what you are providing. That's it.", "NTA, if it\u2019s that critical she can pick it up on the way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(How your sister chooses to feed and raise her son and how you feel about that is irrelevant to this issue.) \n\nYou are the hostess of the event.  You have already chosen a menu.  You are not required to provide a completely separate meal for a single guest.  (This is different from having options for a known vegetarian you invited or something like that.)  Offering to make an alternative, as you did, was generous of you.  If your sister deems the planned menu or the offered alternative unacceptable, she can bring her son his special meal herself.  That is her responsibility as the parent, not yours.  You have enough to do.  If she doesn't like that, it's her prerogative to not attend, but that is NOT on you.  It's on her.", "NTA- Honestly, if she wants continue to only feed him these foods. I would tell her and remind her that she says you shouldn\u2019t meddle in her affairs as a parent.

What she said was quote \"you should provide the food, as you are hosting\". I did try to ask her why but she kept repeating that statement.", "I'd like to clarify that I never claimed outwardly to him that he should change his diet or insisted him at all and I have never shamed him currently or in the future for what he decides to eat.

Is your sister uneducated on nutrition to know that fast food is generally unhealthy, or could there be something to it that she is too self-conscious to share?", "That is completely psycho!", "I was getting super worried so I had to get creative asap. Hope she at least entertains the idea! It's helped my little dude all round! :)", "Ah I think you might have misinterpreted the passionate cook thing. I didn't mean for it to sound cocky or entitled, I just meant I liked cooking for others, that's why I'd gladly try and cook something fun for Louie. \n\nMy sister has always had independant beliefs about parenting styles, so in general she's not a fan of taking advice from others. By saying that, I don't mean she doesn't make good decisions, she's an extremely smart individual and is studying her masters in law, so I have so much respect for her and look up to her a lot. \n\nThe first idea was super good though so I'll recommend that to her.", "Another idea for the future if he likes pizza? My son loves \"cheesy pizzas\" \n\nI get cauliflower bases, the pizza sauce, I boil broccoli, spinach and sometimes kale or very boiled carrots and put it through my food processor and add 4 large spoons into the bottle and use lactose, low fat grated cheese and he loves making them and thinks I've let him have naughty foods. \n\nThere's so many recipes to change the junk food into great, healthier options and trick them haha.", "Man, you are such a lifesaver these options would've been perfect for him, hopefully other parents reading this can benefit from this advice! :)\n\nHowever I asked my sister about them and she's flat out rejected the idea, saying she doesn't need help from anyone else and can manage her child's diet however she wants. I respect her decision of course, but thank you anyways for these super helpful ideas, maybe I'll need it when I choose to have my own kids.", "Fear of his health made me super creative! I make so much now! \nAnd I hope so! :) \n\nMm.. that's a shame, little one needs more options and healthy alternatives. \n\nAnd you're welcome!"]}
