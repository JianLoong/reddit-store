She can get the McDonalds but if you're not around him all the time, you really don't know it's just her parenting. My kid is only \"regular\" autistic picky but I have friends whose kids have ARFID. If he ate something else for you once, that doesn't mean much. I've known a few kids where it was really the parenting but more often it's not. Dial back the judgment, it's not a reflection on your cooking. \n\nChicken nuggets are a super common item with picky/ARFID kids because of the ground up texture. And ye gads, be **really** careful with trying to trick kids like someone suggested downthread. That's how kids lose safe foods.", "Controversial perhaps, but NAH. \nIf your nephew was vegetarian or something, it\u2019d be reasonable for your family to expect that you\u2019d cater to his diet, and I assume they\u2019re equating the McDonalds here to that. Particularly if AFRID and/or some kind of neurodivergence is the cause. It\u2019s reasonable for them to want him to feel included, and catering to his diet is a reasonable expectation. It\u2019s also reasonable for them to say \u201cif you won\u2019t make him feel included we\u2019ll exclude ourselves by not coming\u201d. \nEqually, it\u2019s reasonable for you to not be comfortable to provide a specific meal to cater for his diet, and offer to prepare something else he\u2019ll eat. \n\nI think the issue here is probably a difference of opinion on how McDonalds got landed on as the thing he will eat and the perception of McDonalds.
