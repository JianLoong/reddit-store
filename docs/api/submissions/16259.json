Every month or so, when she needs a break from them, I babysit for a few hours ($8.50/hr). She\u2019s usually gone for 4hrs at a time, and is back at or ~15 minutes later than her specified return time. She leaves me with a list of emergency contacts if something happens and she can\u2019t get home fast enough. We agreed that if I had to use an emergency number, I get $10 extra as \u2018crisis pay\u2019. \n\nThe last time I was watching the kids (around a month ago), Ann stayed out an hour and a half past her specified return time and wasn\u2019t answering my texts or calls. I got worried so I called one of the emergency contacts (Ann\u2019s sister Jenn), who came over to stay in the house while she tried to get a hold of Ann (the kids were asleep by this point, but she didn\u2019t want to leave them in an empty house), and I went home.\n\nWell, as it turns out, Ann had driven into the countryside (with no reception) to stargaze, and got lost. (Jenn texted me this around midnight once Ann finally texted her back).\n\nThe next morning, my mom woke me up, saying that Ann was at the door for me. Here\u2019s how the convo went: \n\nMe (a little groggy): Hey, what\u2019s up? Are you ok?\n\nA: I\u2019m alright, I just stopped by to pay you. \n\n*she handed me an envelope*\n\nA: There you go kiddo, 47 bucks.\n\nMe: Wait, what about the crisis pay? I had to call your sister, it should be 57. \n\nA: What crisis? I wasn\u2019t in an accident or anything, just lost. \n\nMe: You said it was if I had to use an emergency contact, you never said anything about any other requirements. \n\nD: Look, just take it and be happy. A kid like you doesn\u2019t need that much money for five and a half hours of screwing around on your phone. \n\nMe: Fine, have a nice day. \n\n*I shut the door and write it off as a loss*\n\nFast foreword to yesterday. Ann texts me that she want to go out on a girls night, and wants to know if I\u2019m free to babysit. I say that I am, but that she\u2019ll need to pay me the $10 from last time before I agree to do it. She says that she won\u2019t do that, and restates her argument that it wasn\u2019t a \u2018real crisis\u2019 so I shouldn\u2019t get crisis pay. I tell her that I won\u2019t be babysitting for her until I get that $10. She says that she really needs this break, and calls me entitled for refusing. I step back in bewilderment. A few minutes go by without any more texts from her, so I go to my mom to clue her in. \n\nI show her the convo, and to my surprise, my mom agrees with Ann. She affirms that I\u2019m being entitled, that I don\u2019t know how hard it is to be a single mom, and that I should suck it up and babysit. I say that I need time to think and head up to my room. \n\nThis morning Ann texted me to ask if I would babysit or not. I restated my ultimatum, and she also held firm in her refusal. She said she\u2019d find another sitter, I said that\u2019s fine. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve stood my ground, but now I\u2019m questioning if my mom might be right?
