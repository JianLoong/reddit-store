Every month or so, when she needs a break from them, I babysit for a few hours ($8.50/hr). She\u2019s usually gone for 4hrs at a time, and is back at or ~15 minutes later than her specified return time. She leaves me with a list of emergency contacts if something happens and she can\u2019t get home fast enough. We agreed that if I had to use an emergency number, I get $10 extra as \u2018crisis pay\u2019. \n\nThe last time I was watching the kids (around a month ago), Ann stayed out an hour and a half past her specified return time and wasn\u2019t answering my texts or calls. I got worried so I called one of the emergency contacts (Ann\u2019s sister Jenn), who came over to stay in the house while she tried to get a hold of Ann (the kids were asleep by this point, but she didn\u2019t want to leave them in an empty house), and I went home.\n\nWell, as it turns out, Ann had driven into the countryside (with no reception) to stargaze, and got lost. (Jenn texted me this around midnight once Ann finally texted her back).\n\nThe next morning, my mom woke me up, saying that Ann was at the door for me. Here\u2019s how the convo went: \n\nMe (a little groggy): Hey, what\u2019s up? Are you ok?\n\nA: I\u2019m alright, I just stopped by to pay you. \n\n*she handed me an envelope*\n\nA: There you go kiddo, 47 bucks.\n\nMe: Wait, what about the crisis pay? I had to call your sister, it should be 57. \n\nA: What crisis? I wasn\u2019t in an accident or anything, just lost. \n\nMe: You said it was if I had to use an emergency contact, you never said anything about any other requirements. \n\nD: Look, just take it and be happy. A kid like you doesn\u2019t need that much money for five and a half hours of screwing around on your phone. \n\nMe: Fine, have a nice day. \n\n*I shut the door and write it off as a loss*\n\nFast foreword to yesterday. Ann texts me that she want to go out on a girls night, and wants to know if I\u2019m free to babysit. I say that I am, but that she\u2019ll need to pay me the $10 from last time before I agree to do it. She says that she won\u2019t do that, and restates her argument that it wasn\u2019t a \u2018real crisis\u2019 so I shouldn\u2019t get crisis pay. I tell her that I won\u2019t be babysitting for her until I get that $10. She says that she really needs this break, and calls me entitled for refusing. I step back in bewilderment. A few minutes go by without any more texts from her, so I go to my mom to clue her in. \n\nI show her the convo, and to my surprise, my mom agrees with Ann. She affirms that I\u2019m being entitled, that I don\u2019t know how hard it is to be a single mom, and that I should suck it up and babysit. I say that I need time to think and head up to my room. \n\nThis morning Ann texted me to ask if I would babysit or not. I restated my ultimatum, and she also held firm in her refusal. She said she\u2019d find another sitter, I said that\u2019s fine. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve stood my ground, but now I\u2019m questioning if my mom might be right?

You\u2019re 16!??? You rule! It\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s responsibility to give a single mom a break. She obviously thinks she can do whatever and say whatever because you\u2019re a kid ! Thankfully you know better. Your mom though. I think Maybe she\u2019s just trying to keep peace and it\u2019s only $10  BUT it\u2019s SO not only $10. You kept up your end of the deal and she didn\u2019t. The End. \nNow keep growing up good \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95", "NTA. A deals a deal.", "NTA\n\nShe always leaves you alone for longer than agreed. I would never babysit for her again. There are other parents who would enjoy your help if you want to make money babysitting.", "NTA.  You provide a service with your price and rules that she approved.  She reneged on the agreement and owes you money.  Should she decide to pay; tell her that you added compounded interest from day 1.  Raise your prices and think twice about babysitting for someone who is so willing to take advantage of you.\n\nAlso, shame on your mom for not having your back.", "IMHO, her being 90 minutes late alone was worth giving you a $10 tip even without the emergency call crisis clause.", "Oh my gosh girl, no you\u2019re NTA!! This lady is belittling your work and your age. You deserve compensation for the extra time not to mention the PREVIOUS agreement. And don\u2019t let your mom make you feel guilty!! Sometimes moms are just so used to rolling over they take offense when we won\u2019t.", "NTA. I'm sorry about your mom.sje should have your back. I'm almost more angry at her. What kind of mother is OK with her kid being taken advantage of and cares more about the user's victimizer?", "Nta you don't work with bad clients", "NTA. What she's basically telling you is that if a family member is an hour and a half later than their specified time, does not respond to calls or messages at night, you shouldn't treat that seriously? Doesn't even make sense in a \"professional\" setting let alone in a situation where kids are involved.", "You know if you stayed 1.5 more than your allotted time shouldn\u2019t she pay you 12.75 more anyway? \n\nIf your mom is so sympathetic to Ann she can babysit her kids.\n\nOtherwise Ann will need to find someone else. NTA", "Adults can be wrong and in this both are. NTA", "Ann answers the age old question: How much is your pride worth?\n\nEvidently $10. What a pathetic (ant)hill for her to die on.", "Yep. \n\nAlso, just because it wasn't a crisis for her, it absolutely was for OP. They didn't know she wasn't in an emergency, and the stress associated with sorting out the situation was very real.\nHonestly, it's not even a question of money, it's the principle of it. And the fact that in the future her behaviour will cause doubt in OP's mind about how to handle the situation.", "i know it isn\u2019t supposed to be, but \u201ccaptain save a single mom\u201d is the funniest thing i\u2019ve heard all week \ud83e\udd23", "Absolutely not. No way she can find someone to babysit 2 kids for this amount of money without it being another neighbor or friend willing to babysit for pay that low. Sorry Ann, your reluctance to cough up $10 is going to cost a lot more than $10.", "There\u2019s no need to yell, but point taken. I\u2019ll definitely be upping my rate, that is if I ever babysit for her again.", "Yes, her mom is dead wrong here.  Who tells her kid to just suck it up and accept poor treatment (and low pay) and to always put her own needs on the back burner?  \n\nAnn's behavior is incredibly entitled.  I feel as though her mom is pushing OP so that she herself reaps the reward of appearing to be a great mom and neighbor.  \"Oh, she raised such great kids.  They are so helpful.\"\n\nYou are not wrong, OP.  Hold your boundary.  Ann will regret this.", "Agreed. You both decided what counts as a \u201ccrisis\u201d. You didn\u2019t abuse it as she clearly wasn\u2019t home by when she was supposed to be and acknowledged being lost. \n\nIf you slip on this, she will always be able to say \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t really a crisis\u201d.  \n\n\u201cWell yes, I had to go to the hospital, but my sister came and covered so it wasn\u2019t a crisis for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell yes, you called the fire department because you smelled something, but they didn\u2019t find a problem, so it wasn\u2019t a crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that someone was knocking at the door and rattling the handle and you called the police, but they ran off eventually, so you really could have ignored it.\u201d", "Time and a half for those couple of hours you are stuck there after the agreed upon time.", ">Also if she was that desperate for a sitter but is sweating an extra $10-20\u2026 she doesnt have enough money to be going out.\n\nI agree with the gist of what you're saying but that last part is a pretty AH thing to say. It's not like she was out blowing hundreds of dollars at a casino or a bar. She went stargazing. An activity that other than the cost of gas is free. There's nothing wrong with a single mother (who one can assume is on a tight budget) needing to have some peace and quiet for a few hours.", "I was actually hardly on my phone at all until the kids went to bed. We played board games, watched a movie, and did some arts and crafts. I just generally tried to keep them and I entertained, but also keep my attention on them.", "I never saw someone under 15$ an hour", "Ikr. I laughed when I read that. What a bunch of BS.", "Just FYI, this issue doesn't involve parentification. Parentification is when a kid is forced to take on parenting roles for even younger kids that are inappropriate for their developmental age and stage as part of a pattern of abuse and neglect.\n\nThis is a dispute over reasonable wages to be paid in a specific situation and the interpretation of a verbal contract as well as how assertive and/or compassionate OP should be given his employer's circumstance.", "On what planet is a hospital visit worth only $10 of the OPs time and stress? This mother was MIA for 90 minutes.", "What is this? Nonpayment for ants??!", "Exactly. If I was in OPs position, I would think this is a crisis. \nHell, even without the clause I think Ann should have volunteered extra pay just to compensate for the stress involved, and the extra time.", "https://youtu.be/bAG7mAqgqJI", "She absolutely could find somebody at that price who wasn\u2019t a neighbor if she looked hard enough. \n\nThe people she could find, however, are NOT the people who can be trusted to safely care for your children though.", "Lol, \"Hey Ann, thanks for showing me that I need to cover my own emergency pay by building it into the overall pay rate. It's going to be $15/hr now. When do you need me to babysit?\"\n\nNTA.", "To give you an example, at a year older than you some twenty years ago, I charged $15/hour without a \"crisis\" pay because that was just part of the job. You were doing this woman a solid, and she wanted to quibble about what qualified for crisis pay when it had already been agreed upon.", "This is the way.\n\nForget the $10.\n\nJust let her know that due to inflation, your rate is now $11/hr but you will not charge for any calls to the emergency contacts.\n\nIn other words: $10 more every shift \ud83d\ude09.\n\n(Or more - a fair babysitting wage varies widely depending on where you are in the world and tends to rise as the sitter gets closer to adulthood).", "Not sure where you live, OP, but I live near Seattle and my sitter charges $17 for two kids.\n\n...and that's a good deal for me.", "You can babysit for others too, \n\nand the \"a kid doesn't need that much money\" is the mentality that keeps child labour alive. Your pay must be fair for the job you do and the responsibilities you have, it has nothing to do with age.", "Just be unavailable,  let your friends parents know to spread the word, work for someone who values your time and diligence.", "You sound like a great babysitter, and very responsible. NTA, and stand your ground. I don't know why your mother isn't backing you up on this. You not only had to call the emergency contact--they had to come over and watch the kids. If you decide to babysit for her again, raise your rate to at least $15/hour.", "This is the way! Honestl,  you sound like a great babysitter.", "love it, NTA", "Remember that prices for things like babysitting are _very_ regional.", "Same here: $10-15 / hour was my rate in high school ~20 years ago, and I had a one-hour minimum.", "I made $25 in the mod-2000s. OP deserves more.", "That\u2019s an insane deal.", "Disgustingly so at times. There was Facebook post in my local mom's group where someone was looking for an overnight babysitter for two kids, multiple nights a week. Came out to like $3/hr. And someone was either desperate enough, or predatory enough, to be interested in that bs.  dog walkers/sitters generally make/charge more than babysitters in my area.", "I made $10-12 an hour in the early to mid 1990s!"]}
