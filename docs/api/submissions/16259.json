Every month or so, when she needs a break from them, I babysit for a few hours ($8.50/hr). She\u2019s usually gone for 4hrs at a time, and is back at or ~15 minutes later than her specified return time. She leaves me with a list of emergency contacts if something happens and she can\u2019t get home fast enough. We agreed that if I had to use an emergency number, I get $10 extra as \u2018crisis pay\u2019. \n\nThe last time I was watching the kids (around a month ago), Ann stayed out an hour and a half past her specified return time and wasn\u2019t answering my texts or calls. I got worried so I called one of the emergency contacts (Ann\u2019s sister Jenn), who came over to stay in the house while she tried to get a hold of Ann (the kids were asleep by this point, but she didn\u2019t want to leave them in an empty house), and I went home.\n\nWell, as it turns out, Ann had driven into the countryside (with no reception) to stargaze, and got lost. (Jenn texted me this around midnight once Ann finally texted her back).\n\nThe next morning, my mom woke me up, saying that Ann was at the door for me. Here\u2019s how the convo went: \n\nMe (a little groggy): Hey, what\u2019s up? Are you ok?\n\nA: I\u2019m alright, I just stopped by to pay you. \n\n*she handed me an envelope*\n\nA: There you go kiddo, 47 bucks.\n\nMe: Wait, what about the crisis pay? I had to call your sister, it should be 57. \n\nA: What crisis? I wasn\u2019t in an accident or anything, just lost. \n\nMe: You said it was if I had to use an emergency contact, you never said anything about any other requirements. \n\nD: Look, just take it and be happy. A kid like you doesn\u2019t need that much money for five and a half hours of screwing around on your phone. \n\nMe: Fine, have a nice day. \n\n*I shut the door and write it off as a loss*\n\nFast foreword to yesterday. Ann texts me that she want to go out on a girls night, and wants to know if I\u2019m free to babysit. I say that I am, but that she\u2019ll need to pay me the $10 from last time before I agree to do it. She says that she won\u2019t do that, and restates her argument that it wasn\u2019t a \u2018real crisis\u2019 so I shouldn\u2019t get crisis pay. I tell her that I won\u2019t be babysitting for her until I get that $10. She says that she really needs this break, and calls me entitled for refusing. I step back in bewilderment. A few minutes go by without any more texts from her, so I go to my mom to clue her in. \n\nI show her the convo, and to my surprise, my mom agrees with Ann. She affirms that I\u2019m being entitled, that I don\u2019t know how hard it is to be a single mom, and that I should suck it up and babysit. I say that I need time to think and head up to my room. \n\nThis morning Ann texted me to ask if I would babysit or not. I restated my ultimatum, and she also held firm in her refusal. She said she\u2019d find another sitter, I said that\u2019s fine. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve stood my ground, but now I\u2019m questioning if my mom might be right?

When Ann was talking about handling a crisis she was thinking about handling hospital visits or something terrible happening to her kids. While the situation may not have been a crisis for Ann, it was for you. From your point of view the mother of the two kids your babysitting was missing. \n\nAt the end of the day you two had a verbal contract agreeing to the terms of your employment.

I got $40 a WEEK working for one of her clients. my mom thought babysitting a particularly violent 8 month old overnight 5 days a week would be a good first job for me and berated me when I got overwhelmed. I was 12.", "That's a good point. Actually, why is she even arguing her case? Overtime/Crisis payments either way she owes the kid that money.", "Please see my comment above about children being prohibited from working in dangerous jobs. The permit was just a rubber stamp. Actual inspections can discover child exploitation. I would use every penny saved from useless bureaucratic forms and use it towards no notice spot inspections.\n\nRemoving the permit did not allow meat packing plants to hire children. That is one of the dangerous work conditions prohibited under Arkansas state and federal labor laws. Employers who exploit children weren\u2019t filling out those permits, obviously. They were caught by inspections and whistleblowers. Children illegally employed at meat packing plants was already a problem before the useless permit requirement was removed. No employer is going to fill out a form that he or she plans to break child labor laws.\n\nLikewise, $ex trafficking minors is illegal, and prohibited by child labor laws. Traffickers weren\u2019t filling out a permit for their under age trafficked victims. They get caught by police stings and whistleblowers. The permit did not do away with $ex trafficking.,", "*good", "I see what you did there!! And yeah, so long as AnnT continues to put OP at a disadvANTage, I\u2019d remain adamANT in my refusal to accept one less crumb than the agreed upon amount. Her unsubstANTiated claims of OP\u2019s entitlement are ignorANT and pedANTic!!", ">I would use every penny saved from useless bureaucratic forms and use it towards no notice spot inspections.\n\nIMO the fact that I haven't ever heard of no notice spot inspections being a thing anywhere shows the bad faith with which labour laws (and various other safety laws) are enforced. Seems to me like the system is designed to allow companies to get away with anything they can convince or threaten their workers into not talking about.\n\nMy sample size is low, but *any* specific case I've heard about an employee going after their employer for breaking labour laws has resulted in a 5 figure settlement and/or agreement to continue paying the worker as if they still worked there for many months after they leave, including benefits.\n\nIf your employer is breaking laws, gather evidence of it. Even if you don't feel secure enough to do anything about it while you depend on that income, you can always pursue it later when you don't depend on it so much, though pay attention to statutes of limitations. Especially if it's something that would apply to every employee instead of just you specifically, in which case a settlement for you might be even more than what they think they'd have to pay you because they might realize that if they can make it go away while it's just you, they might avoid the dreaded class action. And even better if you can arrange things so that your colleagues find out about it without violating the NDA that they will pursue (and should be unenforceable IMO, but again, system seems designed to let people get away with shit).", "I thought so, thanks lol", "Yeah, I know what that's like. When I was 18 I spent the summer before college working at my brothers employer, an onsite tech support company at a large corp in Chicago, and I was making $14 an hour as a temp in '98. It took almost 20 years for me to get back up to that wage...", "I gotchu fam! \ud83d\ude39"]}
