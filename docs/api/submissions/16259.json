Every month or so, when she needs a break from them, I babysit for a few hours ($8.50/hr). She\u2019s usually gone for 4hrs at a time, and is back at or ~15 minutes later than her specified return time. She leaves me with a list of emergency contacts if something happens and she can\u2019t get home fast enough. We agreed that if I had to use an emergency number, I get $10 extra as \u2018crisis pay\u2019. \n\nThe last time I was watching the kids (around a month ago), Ann stayed out an hour and a half past her specified return time and wasn\u2019t answering my texts or calls. I got worried so I called one of the emergency contacts (Ann\u2019s sister Jenn), who came over to stay in the house while she tried to get a hold of Ann (the kids were asleep by this point, but she didn\u2019t want to leave them in an empty house), and I went home.\n\nWell, as it turns out, Ann had driven into the countryside (with no reception) to stargaze, and got lost. (Jenn texted me this around midnight once Ann finally texted her back).\n\nThe next morning, my mom woke me up, saying that Ann was at the door for me. Here\u2019s how the convo went: \n\nMe (a little groggy): Hey, what\u2019s up? Are you ok?\n\nA: I\u2019m alright, I just stopped by to pay you. \n\n*she handed me an envelope*\n\nA: There you go kiddo, 47 bucks.\n\nMe: Wait, what about the crisis pay? I had to call your sister, it should be 57. \n\nA: What crisis? I wasn\u2019t in an accident or anything, just lost. \n\nMe: You said it was if I had to use an emergency contact, you never said anything about any other requirements. \n\nD: Look, just take it and be happy. A kid like you doesn\u2019t need that much money for five and a half hours of screwing around on your phone. \n\nMe: Fine, have a nice day. \n\n*I shut the door and write it off as a loss*\n\nFast foreword to yesterday. Ann texts me that she want to go out on a girls night, and wants to know if I\u2019m free to babysit. I say that I am, but that she\u2019ll need to pay me the $10 from last time before I agree to do it. She says that she won\u2019t do that, and restates her argument that it wasn\u2019t a \u2018real crisis\u2019 so I shouldn\u2019t get crisis pay. I tell her that I won\u2019t be babysitting for her until I get that $10. She says that she really needs this break, and calls me entitled for refusing. I step back in bewilderment. A few minutes go by without any more texts from her, so I go to my mom to clue her in. \n\nI show her the convo, and to my surprise, my mom agrees with Ann. She affirms that I\u2019m being entitled, that I don\u2019t know how hard it is to be a single mom, and that I should suck it up and babysit. I say that I need time to think and head up to my room. \n\nThis morning Ann texted me to ask if I would babysit or not. I restated my ultimatum, and she also held firm in her refusal. She said she\u2019d find another sitter, I said that\u2019s fine. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve stood my ground, but now I\u2019m questioning if my mom might be right?

I as a mother if my kids received that type of message from an employer would tell them not to work for them again.", "what is it with some mothers. \n\nYes, my son can fixed your computer. It took half a day to fix it. Pay? why? your family/close friend, so you don't have to.\n\nResult is I stopped fixing things for others.", "Better yet, show your mum these comments!", "\\-- ... *for the sake of keeping a secure job.*\n\nI would strongly disagree with this sentiment, if anything, I think you should not allow such thing to weigh in at all. Obviously life is full of different kind of situations, but at this point in life (living with parents), where security of next meal and place to sleep is not in question, is best time to learn to not eat any bullshit from your employers, unless you're compensated for it. It might hurt in the short term, but it usually pays out in the long term.  \n\n\nCertainly NTA.", "Oh she won't find anyone at this rate I doubt she won't come back eventually. But even if she doesn't it is a really low pay.", "no screw off you arent gonna get free karma just because you took the majoritys vote nobody needs your two cents on this youre awful", "Agreed, though I would say that the money is actually part of the important principle at stake. \n\nBecause in addition to the stress of not knowing where she was and having to call the emergency contact, there's also the cold, practical fact that he had to stay and work overtime for an extra hour and a half. His stress and worry is a major factor that shouldn't be discounted, but his time alone is worth that extra money.", "If she had not called she would have been there past midnight. Midnight seems to be when her relief finally got ahold of the mom. Is she supposed to spend the night? Would she have been paid for all those hours or told she doesn't need to be paid for when she is sleeping?", "And they had to stay more than an hour past. Tardiness is a pet peeve of mine, I think it sends a message in this situation that they don't care about the other person.", "Yeah really. She is getting a bargain she is getting child care for 2 kids for $8.50. Most sitters would charge double that for 1 child.", "Except I think this guy is still a teenager I'm not sure and 10 could be big difference, idk", "*his* mom\n\nOP is a dude", "I can\u2019t believe Ann is so cheap. Where in the world does she think she\u2019s going to find another sitter at $8.50/ hr? When I babysat for a neighbor, it was $12/hr and that was twenty years ago\u2026", "Also, OPs mum sticking up for Ann. Nice way to have your child's back.", "That's a good point. Actually, why is she even arguing her case? Overtime/Crisis payments either way she owes the kid that money.", "many years ago one of my sister's friend's had a kid. she was extremely overprotective & refused to ever leave the kid alone. after about a year her husband was losing his mind because he could never get her to leave the kid with anyone to go out to dinner etc. my sister convinced her i was great with kids (i was) and since she'd met me on several occasions & seen me interact with the baby she took a chance and agreed to have me babysit. of course she had a huge list of instructions & called me from the restaurant probably 3 times. but a few hours later she came home to discover that her child was safe & sound and all was well. \n\nover the years i was THE ONLY person she would allow to babysit. the husband was SO FREAKING GRATEFUL that he was able to get her out of the apt. on a regular basis he used to pay me an insane amount of money each time. and i mean INSANE. i have no idea what anyone gets for babysitting but this was back in the early-mid 80s and that man used to pay me a couple hundred dollars for them being gone for just a few hours.\n\nyears later i agreed to babysit on new years eve (by then i was in my late 20s and was done with all the craziness of nyc on new years) and he was so thrilled the guy paid me ONE THOUSAND FUCKING DOLLARS. and had their limo waiting for me downstairs to bring me home (cabs in nyc on NYE are notoriously difficult to get) i mean, they were wealthy, but...still.\n\naccording to my sister, he used to talk about me like i was the best thing since sliced bread. she would joke that i could probably ask him to pay my rent & he'd happily do it haha\n\ni was probably THE most appreciated babysitter on the face of the earth.", ">Forget the $10.\n> \n>Just let her know that due to inflation, your rate is now $11/hr but you will not charge for any calls to the emergency contacts.\n\nDon't forget the $10. The new rule is that instead of a flat fee for invoking the emergency contact, your rate goes up to (at bare minimum) 1.5 times your normal hourly rate if there is unannounced lateness where you have to work past your agreed time and choose whether or not to use the emergency contact.\n\nBecause beyond the stress of the situation, your time and sleep schedule matter too. You aren't a babysitting robot but a person with needs.", "Best comment!! Could not agree more!", "Asked him to babysit -- OP is a teenage boy", "This is how you treat a trusted babysitter. I have four kids now (16,14,8 and 7 months), but when I had the older three, it was really hard to find babysitters. When my niece came of age to baby sit, I was so happy and grateful. I\u2019d pay her well over the going rate and order dominoes for her, her boyfriend and the kids. Trusted, relatable babysitters are worth their weight in gold, mistreat them at your peril.", ">Nonpayment for ants\n\n>\nLiterally expected to work for crumbs\n\nI love what you did here and i can't stop laughing! I like you plenty lmao \ud83d\ude02", "It's true, and if OP caves on this, she will be late *Every. Time.*", "And that OP's own opinions about the terms and conditions of his employment don't matter as long as she can sell a good sob story to his mom.", "Just have to comment my kids are almost the exact same ages \ud83e\udd23 for the older two we had some good trusted sitters but the only person who has watched them the past 8 years is their grandmother and that is only occasional.", "this couple ended up eventually having another kid, and of course i was still the only person she trusted with them. meanwhile the kids loved when i babysat because i'd let them eat m&ms and ice cream for dinner, and stay up much later than their bedtimes. one time when the parents came home the husband walked in first, only to find me asleep on the sofa with the sleeping kids tucked into either side of me, M&M's on the coffee table and toys scattered everywhere (the mom was a stickler for not letting them eat junk, stay up late, have their toys all over the living room). mom was still in the lobby talking to someone, he quickly gathered up the kids, put them to bed, while i cleaned up of the m&ms/toys. he was usually the most calm, cool & collected guy but he was in a state, scared to death that she might decide to not let me babysit anymore if she saw the 'evidence' LOL\n\nluckily, she ever knew a thing. i swear i could practically sense his blood pressure rise hahaha", "This. Because she's now set the precedent that if she's late, she doesn't have to pay the babysitter for their extra time and stress, and if she provokes them to call the emergency contact then she scores a two-for-one deal with unlimited free babysitting from her sister. \n\nOP is absolutely right to hold their line on this. Their extra hour and a half of work deserves overtime pay alone (and $10 is a pretty poor reward for that). She might be a stressed out single mom, but OP's time and sleep schedule has value too.", "With the potential to just get later and later. This is literally shitty boss 101.", "yeah, that actually bothered me as well, I always thought your mom was supposed to have your back, but clearly, that is not the case here.", "A lesson best learned early."]}
