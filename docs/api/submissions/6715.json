Since you mentioned the last time this happened it was 1.5 years ago, this appears to be the exception, not the norm, for her drinking habits. But that\u2019s just me. Only you can decide if this is a dealbreaker for you.\n\nWhat seems more problematic is that you said she openly complained to others about feeling you are irresponsible. Regardless of this is true or not, that\u2019s a dysfunctional-ass way to address the issue she has.", "NTA. I can see why you\u2019re rethinking your relationship. It\u2019s not necessarily the passing out (accidents happen) \u2014 it\u2019s that rather than owning her behavior, she\u2019s blaming you for not being \u201csympathetic enough.\u201d That\u2019s fucked up behavior for someone who knows you suffered torture at the hands of an alcoholic. And shows a real lack of empathy that I would consider a big ass red flag.", "NTA \nThis runs the danger of becoming an essay...so my apologies in advance and here goes...\nI was a big drinker for 20+ years, and would regularly black out. I am now coming up 2 years sober, I like to think I will never drink again but you can never say never! Hey ho onward...\n\nIt used to make mad when people would say 'everything you say drunk is the real truth '. Now for for moderate to light drinkers this may hold some truth, I do not know, I am not one of them, but I can honestly say that everything that came out my face when I was drinking was rambling bollocks. I had a secret mission every time I drank and that was to go to the land of nowhere blackout drunk. It took me a long time of sobriety to realize this but here we are. \n\nSo I would take every drunken word your girlfriend said, roll them all into a little ball in your mind, and then throw them out your ear, they are little more than worthless junk. \n\nWhat does count is her next move. Is she remorseful? Asking forgiveness? Is she mad?...why is she mad? Her sober self is a much more reliable witness to this event as she was not present but has to deal with the aftermath of her choices...may she do so with grace and humility. \n\nYou dealt with her as best you could have, particularly given your history. Walking out and leaving her would have made you an understandable asshole, but you still looked after her, even through the insults. Those who love drinkers may or may not remember looking after them through the insults more than once, it's funny (not) how alcohol does that. \n\nI would give 24-48 hours to let her sort out her mind and body, then have a serious chat about the events leading up to and through the night. Excess drinking can be easily done and sometimes it is easily forgiven, a once off accidental 'whoops one too many' but it becomes a concern when there is no 'off' switch, if it becomes a regular 'habit'. And especially if the drinker is regularly exhibiting nasty, mean behaviour. \n\nSide note: It makes me very nervous when people talk about drinking as a habit. To me a habit is something that brings positivity and growth into your world. To use the word habit in relation to drinking becomes an oxymoron. \n\nUrgh so there it is op, my essay for you - NTA. Stay strong, I hope she can learn from this and together you can move on to a happier place.", "Shitfaced people are the most annoying mfs to have to deal with I don't blame you at all.", "NTA. I can see why you\u2019re upset. It\u2019s up to you whether you can forgive this, and whether you can handle it in the future.", "NTA I was also a child of alcoholic\u2019s add in religious cult members to that so yeah there was no spare the rod in my case. My dad left the church but never could leave the bottle or drugs. I loved him and he fought it until his death but he was also bipolar and a combat veteran so he never managed it. That being said I was not a nice person when he was drunk and I would have to go rescue my mother. I would toss him off decks after taking away his gun and drag him to the VA because the cops all liked him and would let him go. He knew if I showed up that his drinking time was done. My late husband also drank a few times and got mean and I would shut down and become cold and not engage. When I left with our child he went to rehab. Tipsy people are fine, friendly drunks are fine, I drink some myself but never drunk ever. But the minute you get past that stage to falling down and being incoherent I nope out. I just go cold and do not care. So if my family or friends get to that point they know not to come to me. You are NTA you are a survivor with a trauma response and deserve better.

And I guess combined with her drunk ramblings about feeling like she\u2019s the adult in the relationship, I\u2019m wondering what your \u201cgoofy\u201d side is, and how it compares to her once in a while black out. Trying to connect all the dots here.", "I don't get it, since when do drunks expect sympathy?\n\nIt was her choice to get so drunk, which is fine. It is however also your choice to not want to be with a person who gets so drunk, even though it happened only once in 1,5 years. \n\nThe only solution is to talk to her about this and not ask reddit. Talk about it but don't control her by telling she can't get so drunk anymore. If you really feel some of her behavior is truly unacceptable, break up and move on. However, in a relationship, you'll always have to compromise a little and with time that might increase. So just talk about it all before it is too late.\n\nNAH", "Nta I do wonder though does she drink a lot or often just not normally to the pass out point ? You know children of alcoholics not just are at risk to become one but also are prone to be enablers. You may have been drawn to the familiar dynamics. If this is a once a year or so she drinks and it got away from her this time , example social drinker only not every day or week. I would cut her slack if she is not really a drinker, or is a controlled drinker like a wine with dinner. Her bad mouthing you I would be more concerned with . I would not want to be with someone who speaks badly of me.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. I used to have a drinking problem myself, and have been sober for almost 6 years now. I can't stand being around drunk people, and just shiver at the thought that I was like that for so long in my 20s. At this point though, if I were to get back into dating, I would refuse to be with someone who gets that drunk. It's just a line I draw. If that's a deal breaker for you, you aren't an asshole for breaking up with her over it.", "NTA I would dump this lush if I were you. She doesn't seem like \"the one\"", "NTA. I would talk to your sober girlfriend, not the drunk one. Don\u2019t present an ultimatum unless you really mean it.

I\u2019m very sympathetic to your past, but your girlfriend is not an abusive alcoholic like your father. As this seems like a one time mistake from your girlfriend, yes I would expect you to have some caring and understanding for her. I would want to know my partner would take care of me if I was in that position.", "Not the asshole for having no sympathy... but treating her like a sack of potatoes makes you a bit of an asshole.", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re rethinking this relationship.
