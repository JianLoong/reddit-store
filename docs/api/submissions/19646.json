That was seriously shitty. Unless Abbie hasn't done anything for the project, it is unfair to snipe her by making an extra thing and presenting Abbie as having done nothing, when you did not tell her or involve her, which is what it would have seemed like to the teacher if you'd handed in a poster and said Abbie didn't help with it.\n\nAbbie is allowed to bitch about people to her friends. That is a normal human thing to do. You are bitching about Abbie right now. Her friend is the shitty one for telling *everyone* what Abbie said in a moment of annoyance. Abbie should not be friends with that person anymore, that person did this on purpose to cause drama. \n\nDo consider what would happen to you if Abbie started crying at school because she found this post and everyone turned on you. Seems extreme, right? That's what is happening to Abbie right now.\n\nOf course Abbie was lying, because she was embarrassed and because her friend never, ever should have told. You guys are kids, and fessing up when wrong is difficult for even the most emotionally mature of adults. \n\nEmma does deserve a social apology now that she knows, but.....it's also partly Emma's fault Abbie is now being bullied and excluded, so I can see why Abbie is not inclined to give one and is getting herself even more entrenched in this muck mess.\n\nEmma should have known when to drop this and move on, instead of picking at and picking at and picking at Abbie trying to deny things.\n\nAnd Abbie should likewise let this go, stop trying to escalate this to the principal, and learn that what's said in confidence does not stay in confidence.\n\nOverall, Abbie seems like a very defensive little girl with a lot of rage (probably from non-school stuff), Emma doesn't appear to have any social tact or the ability to read the room, and you're just a leaf in the wind.\n\nTell Abbie you understand why she complained about Emma to her friend, and that the current situation is terrible, but she needs to stop now and just say sorry so things can cool down and return to normal. She got caught out, so she should own up.\n\nTell Emma to accept the apology, to look up the importance of \"giving face\", and to just put some distance from this whole thing.", "NTA. Though considering this originated from a group project shouldn't the grading be equal for all those in it the group? If not equal i could understand not included the poster or leaving off credit seeing as it was day before turn in and going without it was discussed priordue to time. However this doesn't excuse Abbie's actions then asking you to pick a side places her in the asshole seat. As someone who has been in the pick sides among friends the best advice i could give is take the road of neutrality and question those ties of friendship based solely on their actions but would still let abbie know they are in the wrong for what was done.", "So we wanted to make a poster, but because we didn't have enough time we decided we wouldn't make one. But Emma lives pretty close to me, so we decided to still make the poster and we told Abbie, she didn't agree with it, but we still made the poster, so I guess that makes me and Emma also the asshole right?"]}
