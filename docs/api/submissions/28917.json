Maybe a therapy session where a therapist is able to help mediate and work through the emotions would be a good idea if it\u2019s affordable. If the two of you decide against telling her it may be worth doing a therapy session with your sister and mom to hopefully discourage your mom from telling her and understand why your mom shouldn\u2019t be the one to say anything.
