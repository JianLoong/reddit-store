My wife with great hearing has been ok with it helping her when sound balance is off in a movie/show as well.  (Venom 2 was a perfect example, we could not make out what venom was saying half the time)  Growing up watching subtitled anime, subtitled english is just natural.  My BIL sometimes grumbles about it though, but the rest of my family is ok with it.  \n\nImo it is selfish to expect someone to watch something \"as a family\" when they can not enjoy it the same as everyone else if there is an easy way to make it so the hard of hearing can enjoy the movie and the normals can still enjoy it.", "NTA. And What does the SATs have to do with subtitles?", "NTA. Have they ever tried ignoring the subtitles? You are far from selfish and your family sucks", "From what I\u2019m reading NTA. I have the same issue and use subtitles more often than not. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bad ask and I don\u2019t know how it inconveniences anyone but not being able to hear the show is an inconvenience.", "Absolutely NTA-I\u2019m so sorry your family are so horrible to you. I\u2019m disabled and being deaf is part of that. Movies either have to be a bit louder or subtitles in use for me. I stopped watching movies with my family for this exact reason. It\u2019s not selfish at all to want to enjoy a movie fully even if that means subtitles. If your sister taking the SAT can be affected by you turning on subtitled she\u2019s got far bigger problems than a movie.", "NTA. You came up with a solution that works for you (watching in your room to not \"bother\" them) and... they still got mad. Sounds like no-win for you regardless of the option you went with.\nI started watching TV with subtitles because of a friend and find it really helpful for myself. Plus, it's funny AF when the subtitle and dialog are just a little different. Or it is to me.\n\nI don't get how it's work for others to watch with them. It's not like you asked to watch a foreign film with English only in subtitles.", "NTA. You are asking for a very reasonable accommodation to take part in a family activity.", "NTA, you're not asking something crazy, just for them to accommodate a disability. Your family sounds toxic. And how would it possibly affect her SATs to have subtitles on a movie? That's ridiculous.\n\nI'm not a person who likes subtitles as I find them distracting, but I'm still gonna turn them on if I'm watching something with my mom, who's hard of hearing.", "NTA.

Unless you're leaving out some major detail, like you screamed curse words at everyone and slammed your door, or you don't need subtitles at all, but just like them. But now if you have any trouble hearing or processing at all and the subtitles help but your family resists, that's not cool, and if you were at work instead of home, it would be illegal. Reasonable accommodations have to be provided.", "NTA. What the fuck? What\u2019s wrong with subtitles? Is it just my house where we always have subtitles on regardless of who\u2019s watching? A lot of ours have two language sets of subtitles at once. Honestly, what\u2019s wrong with subtitles?\n\nNot selfish for not wanting to sit watching a movie that doesn\u2019t make sense in a room full of ableist twaddles.", "NTA.    \nThey, on the other hand, are.\n\nI am fluent in English, and often use subtitles because too often actors talk too fast, or over each other, and it\u2019s the best way to know what\u2019s going on.", "NTA - next time you guys watch a movie turn the volume down or mute it and let them see for themselves how difficult it is for you.", "You're 15 now, so you have less than 3 years before you are out of there. I know it feels long, but it really isn't. Start planning now so that you can say farewell to their abelism the day you turn 18. NTA", "nta. i would tell them whats selfish is wanting you to sit there when you cant watch the movie because your dad wants family time. its not family time if someone is excluded. not turning on the subtitles was excluding you.", "NTA. I prefer subtitles and always have them on. It\u2019s actually kind of weird now to watch something somewhere else without them! I understand that not everyone likes them or can ignore, but if that\u2019s true in your family, then watching stuff needs to be off the table for family time.", "Definitely NTA, I watch everything with subtitles, and my husband has never said anything awful to me about it. Your parents sound like major assholes to me because having subtitles on the screen isn't hurting anyone.", "Inconvenience of subtitles???????\n\nIt's selfish to want to able to watch the movie with them, but it's not selfish to not want subtitles because reasons, then get upset when you leave because you can't watch the movie? \n\nWhat hell is wrong by with your parents. NTA", "I think I have misunderstood the concept \"family time\". It might be because English is not my first language.\n\nI thought \"family time\" was when a family hangs oit together and does something they all can be a part of. Like playing a board game, or a movie that they watch together.\n\nFamily time at OP.s house seems to lack the \"together\" part. If OP was not able to understand the movie but still was required to sit there, then \"family time\" means only \"presence of the family in one room\". Is this the true meaning of \"family time\", or is it only OP.s father who is a strange man?\n\nPlease enlighten me.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone with ADHD sometimes I need captions to understand what\u2019s going on. However whenever a family member sees it they start asking questions and I never feel like dealing with it. So I just keep it off. But talk about this with them and if they keep calling you selfish then keep being selfish. It\u2019s not about the subtitles, it\u2019s about the fact that they\u2019re being ableist denying accommodations to you.", "NTA - the subtitles should be the rule not the exception in your house.", "Wtf? How in the seven hells does your sister having SATs tomorrow have _anything whatsoever_ to do with having subtitles on? NTA. Your dad, however, is a massive AH. Subtitles are not an inconvenience. If you need them, you need them; if you don\u2019t need them, ignore them. It\u2019s not hard.", "A movie without subtitles is gibberish if there\u2019s any other sound (a fan, people breathing.) idk why, not hard of hearing. Just was a thing one day and ever since. \n\nWhy watch a movie you can\u2019t even understand? May as well watch a foreign movie without subtitles. Im not understanding where selfish even comes in tbh.", "Thank, it\u2019s been really affirming reading these comments", "I don\u2019t know about you but I can\u2019t stop from reading subtitles if they are on. If sister was trying to have some mindless movie chill time before the biggest test of her life thus far, I can see it being too much that particular time while needing brain in low power mode.", "I mean, I *cannot* ignore the subtitles. Like, ever. That being said, I absolutely would not deny a family member the right to be able to comprehend what we were watching together. \n\nOP, NTA.", "Agree \n\nAs a person that needs subtitles. \n\nF*** them. It\u2019s not \u201cfamily time\u201d when they are watching something you can\u2019t follow. You are just sitting in the same room, watching them, watch TV. \n\nCan you get a hearing test or doctor\u2019s note? I would put it on the table at the next family dinner and state:\n\nFamily, this note says I cannot hear the TV and need subtitles. This is a no-kidding disability that you are deliberately ignoring. \n\nFamily you have 5 choices:\n\n1. Turn on the subtitles \n(Really what the big deal? My family was like wow I never realized how much I was missing until subtitles)\n2. Buy a Bluetooth(?) tv that allows you to wear headphones \n3. Buy you \u201cthe in ear\u201d hearing aids\n4. Let you watch the show on your computer with AirPods and subtitles in the same room with them. \n5. Let you leave.", "It\u2019s a lot easier to understand what someone is saying if I\u2019m in the room with them because their voice is clearer and I can read their lips. It\u2019s hard to read lips with someone being on a screen. Not to mention that the movie was animated so I couldn\u2019t read lips at all.", "I can hear just fine but need subtitles or miss a lot of dialogue.", "Can I ask you to please explain your reasoning? I don't understand how OP is the AH", "Random unsolicited advice: if you mean that you used to be able to hear with background noise but no longer can/have trouble distinguishing sounds, that actually is indicative of certain types of hearing loss. So if it ever becomes an issue, don\u2019t hesitate to ask your pcp to refer you for a hearing test.\n\nIf I misunderstood your comment, please ignore me haha.", "You're nta at all!!\nSeriously some people seem to have this weird vendetta against subtitles for no reason.", "That is such bullshit. Subtitles aren't a big inconvenience at all.\nSurely you're being sarcastic?", "I\u2019m like that too. But of course if somebody else needed the subtitles I wouldn\u2019t complain.\n\n(Omg isn\u2019t it the worst when the subs and dialogue don\u2019t match? That makes me lose my mind lol.)", "I live in a non-English speaking country, so EVERYTHING we watch has subtitles. \n\nPeople still graduate.", "It depends on the person. I have an easier time understanding movies with subtitles, but I have family members who struggle to not focus on the words. In our case, it's the fun, different flavors of adhd.\n\nHowever, OP is definitely NTA. They can't scream at OP for wanting subtitles, then demand they hang out with the family and call them selfish for not. (well they can, they obviously did, but they're not in the right about it)."]}
