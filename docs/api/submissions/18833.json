You don't watch em.\n\nSounds to me that your family finds it troubling to have a child with different needs and they think it's fair to lash out on you when you express them.

I think OP would be first in line if that could be fixed tomorrow. \n\nNTA but sadly you will have to live with these people a while longer, so make your room as comfy as you can, you will be spending plenty more time there...", "I have 30ish% hearing loss in my left ear amongst other issues. 10% in my right.  I was kicked in the head by a particularly vindictive horse (before you fine for me, this horse had a freaking record and a KILL COUNT.  One of those animals that \"isn't right\" but was never dealt with or trained/ worked with. I was 10 and 1) would never have been allowed alone that animal and 2) that animal should never have been allowed in that barn).\n\nI *also* have adhd. So it's a perfect cocktail of \"fuck with me\" to just make my day/ time hell.  Half the time I can't hear cause my brain is going haywire;  the other half *I legitimately can't hear you*. \n\nWe have subtitles on EVERYTHING. I pull lyrics to music up,  even.  My mother DESPISES subtitles and will always make a comment but she leaves them on at least \n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this op. You may need to contact cps if you're a minor about neglect/ abuse of this continues. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your parents suck, sorry.", "Like sure they don\u2019t HAVE to pander to your needs. But they are assholes for choosing not to, it certainly wasn\u2019t the kind choice. And that choice meant you wouldn\u2019t watch the movie with them. Again that\u2019s on them not you. NTA", "NTA, it's massively concerning that they'd blow up on you for such a minor and reasonable request, sounds a bit toxic", "NTA\nI'm guessing since you said you have cognitive problems your parents see you as a \"burden\" and your sister is the golden child. I've seen similar stuff IRL with people with even minor disabilities are treated less than while their siblings are showered with affection.", "NTA you whole family sucks and are abusive.  You have a disability and won\u2019t give you the aid that you require to have the family time that you dad wanted.  It seems like your sister is the golden child and they just put up with you.\n\nI am so sorry that you have people who are supposed to care about you treat you like crap.", "NTA\n\nHow are subtitles an inconvenience to anyone? Your family seems like huge jerks. There is no conceivable justification for refusing to turn on subtitles. Even if you didn't have some sort of neurological disorder that requires them. If you just liked them, there'd be little reason not to turn them on. The fact that you actually have a reason for needing them in order to be able to experience the dialogue means that there is no excuse for not having them on. Your dad is just awful.", "Info\n\nDo you have diagnosed processing problems? I'm not trying to be mean, but teenagers fake a lot of stuff for attention and it gets a little tiring sometimes", "NTA that\u2019s horrible excluding you like that. My husband has partial hearing loss with one ear completely deaf from toddler age and other ear industrial deafness. It\u2019s been 20 years and I tend to be the one to turn them on first because the sound balance for the last decade plus is terrible in so many things now so I feel like I\u2019m going deaf when people are speaking at least until the action special effects sounds or music comes on.", "NTA-\nYour parents, especially your father is an AH \n\nA major jerk", "I don't have any issues with hearing but I prefer having subtitles on for some reason. My partner doesn't use subtitles but puts them on for me every single time. \n\nHe said \"why wouldn't I put them on for you if you find it useful and it doesn't bother me or effect my watching if they're on\" \n\nI agree, having subtitles at the bottom of the screen makes a very small difference to anyone else watching the movie however you being un able to hear the movie is a way bigger inconvenience. \nThey're extremely self centred. NTA. They are.", "I don\u2019t have any known cognitive or hearing problems, but sometimes hearing someone say something loud and clear still makes it to my brain like they\u2019re speaking a foreign language. It\u2019s even worse with TV, especially when you add in the drastic volume changes because I can\u2019t hear a lot of quiet stuff (I don\u2019t like to have the volume up real loud to bother the others in my house, so if it has loud scenes, the volume is too low for quiet ones). \n\nThe TVs/apps on them in my house are just set to always have the subtitles on. When we use a new app that isn\u2019t set for that yet, my husband often turns them on for me before I even realize, and has never complained when I notice first and ask him to turn them on. If he minds them at all, he\u2019s never mentioned it. Because normal people don\u2019t have a problem accommodating those they love, especially in such an easy way. It sounds like they just want to be assholes. \n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA. Watching a movie when you aren\u2019t even allowed to know what\u2019s going on is entirely pointless. I would have left as well. If they want to spend time with you watching a movie, they\u2019ll make it possible for you do enjoy it as well.", "What are the fuck did I just read on this day? Op\u2019s family sound awful. Being selfish by having subtitles on? Unless the other family members have a disability Where words on the screen make bad things happen to them, where do they get off acting this way? Maybe they think OP is playing around with what\u2019s going on but just Wow. Definitely not the asshole.", "lovely, if your psychologist even agrees w you that should give you your answer. you are NTA.", "NTA, maybe they'd listen to your psychologist if they refuse to listen to you.", "Next time I\u2019d just say \u201cwhat did they say?\u201d Until it annoys them to turn the subtitles on.", "Srsly...wtf is that? \"Have standardized testing tmrw, can't afford to spend brain power accidentally reading\"...wow. \n\nBUT fine, ok - O.P. made accommodations for that, but is instead punished. Just min-blowing.\n\nYo O.P. you got other family too.", "Yep. I\u2019m not American and I spent the night before my big college admission test (arguably harder that the SAT\u2019s) watching three foreign films, all with subtitles lol. That was clearly just an excuse, and a bad one at that.", "Hard agree.\n\nI require subtitles to understand what is being said in most tv shows and movies. So what does my husband do? He makes sure they're available and, unless he forgets, turns them on before I notice.", "Absolutely wtf is going on with this family!! It\u2019s not only ableist but neglect, gaslighting and emotional abuse. Your sister has the SATS tomorrow\u2026..what does that even mean dad?! \n\n\u201cYou know damn well if your sister reads any subtitle or text of any kind on the tv screen it will seriously hamper her chances of getting an A\u201d \n\nNTA. Christ I really want better family for you kid, they fucking suck for this.", "Yeah wtf, it's basically nothing to turn them on", "add the mom too. she basically agreed.", "This. NTA", "I think it's also about the father being controlling. He doesn't want to turn on subtitles and he also doesn't want OP to just watch the movie in her own room. He wants OP to do exactly what he tells her to.\n\nNTA. And as someone growing up outside the US with English being second language, subtitles are the norm here (we watch a lot of American movies). I honestly can't imagine someone's experience and ability to relax being ruined over subtitles.", "I am not hard of hearing and I usually always know what's said, even if distracted with mh ADHD, but I still, if possible, watch everything with subtitles. Even when I went to school and it never made me fail tests. Well, my test anxiety did, but not watching movies or series with subtitles. If sis fails SATs cuz of subtitles, she got other issues. \n\nI hope OP is doing otherwise okay at home and that this was a one time awful ableistic incident... makes me worried. OP is NTA.", "It's not even selfish for anyone to want subtitles, let alone someone hard of hearing. It's not a fucking sacrifice to put on subtitles. And for your *child* who needs them? \n\nI feel so bad for OP. She deserves so much better.", "Nothing. It\u2019s just the dad\u2019s flimsy justification for why they couldn\u2019t use subtitles that night.", "This is me. I can hear but can't hear because my brain can't process what is being said. I've told people in the past that if they're not willing to turn on subtitles that I'm gonna leave because I won't understand the movie.", "Yeah, all this because OP's family couldn't be bothered to turn on subtitles to accommodate her disabilities.", "There's always got to be one of you on these posts, doesn't there?", "You can hear it, you just can't understand it. Everything is muddled.", "You're not being unreasonable when you ask them to make accommodations for your impairment. Your family seems poisonous. And how could subtitles on a movie possibly effect her SAT scores? That is absurd.\nAlthough I don't enjoy subtitles since I find them annoying, I'll still turn them on if I'm viewing anything with my hearing-impaired mother.", "Same, sometimes the dialogue is super soft, or I'm just having a day and want subtitles. My bf isn't a fan of them at all, but whenever we watch a movie together he always makes sure to put on the subtitles for me. It's not a massive inconvenience to have some smallish words pop up on the bottom of the screen, and half the time once you get into a movie you don't even notice they're there. But god forbid sister not be able to relax during SAT's because some scary words came up on the screen.", "Yup. I hate subtitles (spoils the jokes), but I have several family members who can\u2019t hear well so I deal with it. Their inability to *hear* trumps my *annoyance* of subtitles. I love their company more than I hate subtitles. I\u2019m so sorry, OP. NTA", "Same about the subtitles. If they aren't on, I am totally lost.\nOne of the first times I realized just how much my, then boyfriend, now husband, cared about me was because he put the subtitles on automatically. I remember being shocked that he had paid attention and cared enough to do that without my having to ask. It also served to highlight just how much my family didn't care or pay attention, which was a weird realization in and of itself.\nOP doesn't deserve that kind of treatment, and her family are the selfish ones.", "I\u2019ve gotten so used to having them on now I find it weird if I don\u2019t. I also like knowing what is being said and sometimes it isn\u2019t always clear.", "Seriously, WTF? \"If anything even minorly challenges your sister's ability to fully brain off relax, whether that be subtitles being on or feeling guilty because you're in your room because you can't just watch it without like a *normal* person, she won't get into college and it'll be your fault\" is basically what dad said there. That's just...pants on head ridiculously faulty logic.", "Yeah, my partner and I are from different countries, and live in a third, so no matter what we are watching, it will be in at least one of our second/third/fourth language, so we have subtitles for literally everything. I also have auditory processing issues, so that's another layer that makes them extremely helpful.", "I went through the same thing you are when I was your age. It wasn't about subtitles so much as auditory processing difficulties. Nearly everyone knew I had it yet they still yelled at me for it all the time. \n\nI hope things get better for you soon.", "That can be structural hearing issues (as in, hearing loss) or a processing issue btw. I have the latter - my hearing is perfect, but I can't differentiate between layered sounds very well.", "I have this issue. And also if I\u2019m on the phone and my partner starts talking, I can\u2019t really understand either sets of words. In my case it\u2019s neurological.", "My audiologist labeled my hearing problem as \"aural dyslexia\" - my brain stem garbles signals so that what I hear is not what was said. Captions help me immensely.", "Okay,  it then why scream at OP and then go nuts at them for leaving the room? This had nothing to do with the SATs, it was just a way for the dad to try to get OP to shut up.", "If this was the case that they could have simply said, \"Sister doesn't want subtitles because she's stressing about a huge test, can you just chill here and have family time this once without it?\"\n\nInstead, dad started calling OP selfish and all kinds of other crap and mom had the nerve to agree with them with how they treated op. \ud83d\ude44  \n\nI would bet that op would have been cool enough to say \"ahh that's why no subtitles. ok, cool, I can just watch the movie later with them, and I'll try to follow along as well as I can.\"\n\n\nDad, mom, and sister are all the AHs for how they behaved.", "But which is more inconvenient, ignoring subtitles (which is entirely possible) or not being able to hear the movie? \n\nAlso if watching anime , for example, means you'll fail your test tomorrow then I doubt you'll be doing well in the first place.", "Biggest test of her life ?? You don\u2019t even need the SAT now to get into a university or college. It\u2019s like a recommendation or can help you score scholarships but it\u2019s not a guaranteed way to get into college.", "Right and even then, OP went to watch the movie elsewhere. Very graciously was like \u201chey if you don\u2019t want my accommodation, you don\u2019t have to deal with it\u201d even when family were the ones being rude. NTA OP and I hope your family can get a grip because you deserve better.", "I would tell them that asking you to wait there while your dad wants family time prevents you from seeing the movie is selfish. If someone is left out, it isn't family time. You were excluded if the subtitles weren't on.", "Yup the sound design in some movies and shows is terrible.", "Elementary was the worst. I understood less than 25% of the dialogue without the subtitles.", "I live in an English speaking country and use subtitles all the time because I don't want to limit my movie watching to only made for English speaking audiences. \ud83d\ude43", "For some people, including me, if subtitles are on it\u2019s very difficult to focus on watching and absorbing the movie/show. Ofc it\u2019s no excuse for being ableist, just saying it can definitely be an inconvenience", "Nah subtitles are a huge inconvenience for me and they majorly reduce enjoyment of a film. I end up reading the words instead of listening, and I\u2019m reading them too quickly so I miss the pacing and delivery for funny/emotional/scary/etc. Then I look at the picture after I\u2019ve read the words and I find I\u2019ve missed a little bit of what I was supposed to be looking at. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only times I watch with subtitles are for foreign films where subtitles are obviously necessary (although I rarely watch them because of the issue) or rewatching something I\u2019ve had on before when I need to keep the volume down (binging an old series early morning when everyone else is still asleep). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat being said. If I was watching a movie with someone who *needed* subtitles, I\u2019d take my inconvenience over them not being able to enjoy it at all. At least that way we both have some level of enjoyment instead of me being entirely happy and them being entirely excluded.", " It\u2019s not selfish at all to want to enjoy a movie fully even if that means subtitles. If your sister taking the SAT can be affected by you turning on subtitled she\u2019s got far bigger problems than a movie.", "I couldn't begin to tell you how much French and Spanish I've learned to pronounce correctly from using subtitles.", "I feel exactly the same, I can't help but focus on reading the subtitles if they're on. But I've lived with people who need them so I suck it up because I'm not going to exclude a loved one from spending time together.", "True. And nobody does sheer horror like original Asian horror. We all benefit each other with symbiosis. It all flows together. \ud83d\udc95"]}
