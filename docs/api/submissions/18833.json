You don't watch em.\n\nSounds to me that your family finds it troubling to have a child with different needs and they think it's fair to lash out on you when you express them.

This is EXTREMELY common for HoH kids with hearing families. They often expect us to do ALL the work in communicating and socializing while they do none. My mother told me once she was surprised I go to the movies with my husband. I never wanted to with her. I told her I use the caption devices at the movies now and she scoffed and said she was surprised my husband isn't embarrassed to see me going in with it. It's fine, as far as they're concerned, for us to sit there bored and frustrated so long as THEY don't have to put in any work. They often like to hide our issues, or use us for inspirational stories for their friends. My brother hated captions growing up and has called my parents out for their ableism as an adult. My husband has called my parents ableist to their faces for how they did, and still do, treat me. Some parents are lovely and wonderful. My husband is the dad to my HoH daughter that I needed growing up. But many, MANY, are like yours and mine. \n\nFrom a 28 year old hard of hearing woman, it's common. But it's WRONG. You're not selfish. You're disabled and your family is refusing you accommodations. I promise, it gets better. Find yourself some solid friends over the next few years. You'll find people eventually who look for captions for you. One of my best friends automatically pulls up lyrics for me when he's sharing music. My husband gets angrier than me when captions aren't available on something we want to watch. Yet another of my friends dragged me to the concession stand at the theater when I was 18 and told them \"My friend here is an anxious wreck and damn near Deaf. Do you have anything with captions? I want HER to enjoy the movie, too.\" I didn't have to say anything. She noticed I usually sat there frustrated and upset. Go away for college, if you can. If you're into tech and are in the States, RIT in Rochester, NY is expensive, but they cater to Deaf/HoH students. It's a National Institute for the Deaf. My husband went there and says a lot of hearing students just naturally pick up Sign as well as verbal communication techniques, like making sure they have your attention before talking, looking at you when they speak, and speaking in a clear, projected voice (those are honestly just a good habit for ALL verbal communication that everyone should learn, but I digress). Move out as soon as practical. TAKE SIGN CLASSES if you can! Because if your parents are like mine, I'll bet you have been forbidden from learning Sign, but there's something freeing about picking it up. Don't wait until you're like me and almost 30 before you try. Take classes in college if you can. \n\nOnce you're out, find your freedom. If you have aids and are required to wear them at all times, take them TF out when you want. They're wonderful, but they get SO uncomfortable and it's so FREEING to just take the things off when you're just relaxing at home. Set your devices to default to captions on. Find friends who love you, not despite your disabilities, because that's gross, but who love you enough to learn how to communicate with you. Friends who truly meet you midway, and YES, we're doing our part in that when we look at them, give them our full attention, and lip-read when they speak, with or without hearing aids. \n\nI'm so sorry, sweetie. I've been there. A lot of us have. It'll feel like forever, but you're almost at an age where you can be out. You have every right to be upset and frustrated. I remember how bad it feels. I remember wanting to cry because I felt obligated to sit through a movie where I heard one word in five, especially against loud music or unnecessarily loud explosions. I remember the name calling from my own family, accusations of selfishness, being treated like I was FORTUNATE my parents even tried to communicate with me, like *I* was a horrible villain for needing captions, or accidentally leaving them on the TV... I promise, it gets better. You're not an inconvenience. You deserve access to the accomodations you need, and you deserve respect. You deserve people who love you so fiercely they'll make sure you can enjoy the same things as them. You don't deserve to be treated like a criminal because you need goddamn CAPTIONS and you didn't wanna sit there lost about what you just watched. You deserve to not have to speak up and advocate for yourself ALL THE DAMN TIME. Because it's so important, yes, but it's SO exhausting, and you shouldn't have to do that in your own home, with your own family. \n\nAgain, from a 28 year old HoH lady, it gets better. Just hang in there. You're not selfish. You're gonna be okay eventually.", "Subtitles can be mildly annoying if you don\u2019t need them. They don\u2019t lower your SAT scores. This sounds ridiculous. NTA.", "I hate subtitles. Hate them. I read faster than people talk so having them up can really ruin movies for me with reveals, jokes etc. It makes the timing of scenes off. It's a complete pain. My mum is losing her hearing and watches TV with subtitles. When we are watching things together, guess what I do? Yeah. I put the subtitles on. Me being a second or two out of sync is far less important than her not being able to enjoy it at all. What would be the point in asking her to sit and watch something that makes no sense to her due to how little she's hearing? That would just be unkind.

I don't pay attention to what all I've watched, and I usually use dubs when available, unless it's the other language I know.

I can think of two series on Netflix that were of good quality, but one got boring as Netflix series tend to do, and I didn't finish the last season. \n\nIf foreign language films are such an important part of your personality that all your friends watch them all the time, that seems a bit shallow. My best friend and I are into books, but I'm more fantasy and she's more sci-fi. We can talk about what it's like to enjoy books without having read the exact same ones. It's actually almost more fun because neither of us have to worry about spoiling a book for the other, because we'll never read the other's faves. \n\nI personally always have subs on, but I prefer them to match...I put on subs in the other language I know when I'm listening to that audio. I also hate it when I'm watching a movie in English and subs in English come on for that other language as it's spoken by a character, but they don't match what is being said very well.", "There's lots of kids who never even took the SATs because of covid, and the ones I know all got into good schools and are doing great.", "This should be the top comment.

I can't not focus on it.  I'd love to not miss everything else that is happening visually and not feel totally overwhelmed and drained and end up with a headache, but I haven't figured out how.
