You don't watch em.\n\nSounds to me that your family finds it troubling to have a child with different needs and they think it's fair to lash out on you when you express them.

But every 30 seconds ask what was said and drive them nuts.", "Definitely NTA, and definitely not selfish.\n\nTo take it further, the social model of disability would suggest that while OP has an impairment, it's their family that has just totally fucking disabled them by denying accommodations. *They* are the AHs.", "NTA. I have hearing issues and need heading aids. My boyfriend uses subtitles for me all of the time. It isn't selfish, and it's also not a big deal. I'm sorry that your family is terrible.", "Yup.", "Absolutely NTA. What is this shit golden child mentality?? \n\nI would just constantly maliciously comply and ask \"what did they say\" \"I can't hear them\" \"can we turn the column up louder....louder...louder...\" Until they finally get that you can't understand it. \nAnd if they complain further, start mumbling at them. When they say good morning, go quiet. Just start talking a lot quieter. It's not the best advice but I'm petty.", "Counterpoint: sometimes assholely is so pure and irrational that the only term for it is assholely.\n\nTake a slightly more extreme example: say there was a serial killer whose \"type\" was people in wheelchairs.  We wouldn't bother calling this person \"abelist,\" they're just a complete psycho.\n\nThese parents are irrational monsters, not prejudiced or conservative or smallminded or anything else culturally relevant.", "Don\u2019t forget mom. She\u2019s TA too. I\u2019m", "\n>My wife with great hearing has been ok with it helping her when sound balance is off in a movie/show as well.  (Venom 2 was a perfect example, we could not make out what venom was saying half the time) \n\nMy husband and I exclusively watch things with subtitles, and I seriously understood SO much more of what was going on in Dune than when we saw it at the cinema haha", "I don't think this person is ready for their SATs if they're watching movies the night before and are this scared of reading", "Pretty much this. I thought it was reasonable they went upstairs to watch the movie with subtitles rather than kick up a fuss. You want me to watch it you then make it watchable for me too.\n\nThis is so nuts, that I can't help but wonder if we're missing more of the story", "You have the correct definition for family time as most people view it! OP\u2019s dad is a strange man.", "No, the OP's father has a weird take on 'family time', especially since they are excluding OP by not allowing subtitles.", "Your kids? I normally expect parents to be fond of their kids but if you required subtitles to do so, more power to you!", "Yes! Tell them the sound distracts you, and you need to relax.", "LOL what is this take???", "Thing is, movies don't always show the person talking. I agree that OP should learn as many ways to deal with her disability, for her own good, but it won't work for these scenario.", "Can I ask how is somebody who is head of hearing asking not demanding subtitles to be put on so they can join in the family movie time who then gets berated and called selfish for not understanding possibly in the wrong.", "And btw even if you think about it from their perspective, they\u2019re still jerks. I\u2019m so sorry. I hope they realize how terrible that is, and that you can have peace and love with your family soon :(", "My SO figured out a way to set my TV itself up to turn on captions if there isn\u2019t an option for it. I love him so much for it.", "My mum doesn't like subtitles, but I find it easier to focus on listening when I'm also reading them (I guess it's the ADHD)....so my mum puts the damn things on?? It's not hard to be considerate, jesus, especially if they're an actual need", "Even though I\u2019m American, I have to turn on subtitles for BBC productions because I can\u2019t understand what the heck they\u2019re saying!", "Another person from outside the US here, and the country I live in is so small no one bothers to dub anything. Everything meant for an age that can read is subtitled. Maybe it's because I'm so used to them but the only time they bother me is if they are in another language I don't speak, since I will automatically read them... OP's family are just being controlling assholes.", "Subtitles are the norm *everywhere* now iirc.", "If she\u2019s worried about messing up her SATs tomorrow why isn\u2019t she studying instead of watching a movie?", "To be honest, this looks more like a sister on E-level. Dad is even worse.", "If SATs is what I think it is (and if OP is in UK) then they're a form of exam at the end of primary school (or infant school). But eff me if a few fkn subtitles are gonna prevent the kid from doing better or worse, ffs.\n\nSorry about your family, OP, you're 100% NTA, but I can't say the same bout your folks. I'm not hard of hearing but I struggle to differentiate sounds when there's so many at once, so subs are almost always a must for me.  \n\n\nI really hope your family get their shit together.", "Subtitles can be really annoying. They spoil the punchlines to jokes and distract your eyes away from what is happening on screen. \n\nNow if someone in the group struggles with out them fair play they go on no arguments. But if no one needs them on I will always choose to watch without. \n\nI even decided to get a soundbar that you can increase the volume of spoken words to get around the issue with movies over doing the action audio", "This again...?\n\nOP's family were being asses, but that doesn't mean there's no good reason to not want subs on. They're distracting, block visuals and can contain spoilers. I spend 95% of my time reading subs because I mostly watch foreign language stuff (though even then sometimes they're not entirely correct, but that's a whole other issue) so I'm well accustomed to using them. Still doesn't mean I ever want to use them if I'm watching something in my native language.", "Holy shit I think you're right. My mother is like that but that never occured to me because when i was little she was a super fast reader. I mean she went through multiple Harry Potter books in one day once.\n\n What i never considered is between then and now she developed a meth addiction (clean for a decade) and that probably heavily fucked with her reading ability cuz she hardly ever reads either.", "Same. I have them on all the time, even watching something in my native language that is not particularly difficult to hear. It's just the default now. We are also a trilingual family, and learning more. I suspect that multilingualism helps you to process language faster, whereas some people who are monolingual maybe are slower processing the words and get more distracted. Or maybe not, maybe it's just that if you need it for your non-native languages you get used to it.", "I had my hearing tested years ago and it was perfect! And yet it *still* sounded like everybody around me spoke 20% English and 80% Gibberish! And I was confused as hell!!\n\nTurns out \"audio processing issues\" are a thing, and also a symptom of adhd. Which I was diagnosed with later in life.\n\nIf you ever talk to someone and hear nothing but gibberish, but then completely understand what they say a few seconds later, it's definitely a phenomenon worth looking into. (Whether it is ADHD related or not, of course.)", "That might be Auditory Processing Disorder, if you also struggle hearing other people with background noise.", "NTA and I really hope you show this post and comments to your family to open their eyes a little.", "\"yo O.P. you got other family too.\" -\ud83e\udd13", "Same, I find myself reading then and it's annoying because they are often ahead of the dialog,  that being said I'd am watching with someone who needs them, I wouldn't deny them the subtitles or complain! OP is NTA.", "Sometimes I wish kids came with subtitles because I cannot always understand what they are trying to ask for or tell me.", "I didn't really think about that entirely, but you're right. I was thinking in general statements, like you can't always rely on subtitles. \n\nCOVID basically made my life 10x harder because masks got rid of the ability to lip read my teachers to follow. I'm just thinking from experience, I don't know why people are downvoting me when I do only state the truth. \n\nNot everyone will accommodate you and you eventually have to accommodate yourself. Maybe a movie wasn't the best example of lip reading, and I get that, but I don't think it was outrageous enough to be downvoted for.", "As far as I'm aware I have no cognitive problems nor I'm hard of hearing but having conversations in English (I'm fluent but not native) when people were wearing masks was a lot harder. Until then I never realised how much I relied on lip reading to have a conversation. \n\nAlso, regarding your family, you have context and you are used to the way people talk, so a lot of info is not needed like it is when you're watching a movie for the first time.", "Or sometimes the chips are too crunchy to hear the dialogue. Anyone else?", ">god forbid sister not be able to relax during SAT's because some scary words came up on the screen.\n\nNot sure if sister is really ready to take the SATs tbh.\n\nTW:\n\n>!There's words that you have to read in the exam paper!!<", "Tbh I find it a massive inconvenience as I can't help but read them which just detracts from watching and enjoying the film. So I'd probably rather not watch than watch with subtitles. \n\nBut I also wouldn't feel like my desire trumps someone else's needs. So if we wanted to watch together that's something I would have to accommodate.\n\nReally wish they would just change how sound is output and make voices its own channel so we can set it to a level that works for us.\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "We always have the subtitles on if we can, because our front door is right on the pavement, so we get a lot of the street noise, and it seems like there's always a car/a shouting child/a cat argument/a motorbike going by right during the softest part of dialogue.\n\nMy father-in-law hates subtitles (but he sure does love reading aloud any label or advertisement he sees), so when we go over to their house, everything is as loud as it possibly can be (no, he's not going deaf what are you talking about) and then he talks over the television as well.\n\nWe don't watch TV at their house any more.", "I know right, personally I think half of these so called actors don\u2019t enunciate properly so its great whether you have impairments or not to have subtitles.", "It is a wonderful feeling when your SO remembers your preferences and does the little things that mean a lot", "Sound for movies is also mixed differently now. Before, the dialogue was more clear. Vox made a video about it\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VYJtb2YXae8", "Yep, i have ADHD and autism and a hearing hypersensitivity and I also struggle with processing some different types of sensory input, especially auditory, and yea, the layers thing you're referring to is reallllll omg.", "You might be surprised by both the rate of complete illiteracy and the average reading level.", "Yeah, snacks can get very loud. That's why I use subtitles.", "Please don\u2019t joke about trigger warnings in a post about verbal abuse and ableism. I was legitimately nervous to click on that.", "I watch foreign movies and shows in their original language with subtitles. The dubbing drives me nuts because it doesn\u2019t match the mouths moving. Also, the inflection is totally different. I watched a few episodes of Squid Game in English and it was so much better when I switched to the Korean.", "Agreed.", "People that get mad about subtitles are bizarre to me. I just keep them on because sometimes actors pronounce words differently then you are stuck wondering what the heck they meant for the next few seconds.\n\nI think that people that can't abide subtitles are just in it for the pretty colours and big explosions. They stopped caring about plots at the sam time as their books stopped being mostly pictures."]}
