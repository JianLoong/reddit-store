I'm asking from a moral standpoint. \n\nBasically, I've lived in my rental for 8 years. It's a 4 bedroom, 2 bath apartment. Soon after COVID hit, my landlords (60+yo married couple) raised my rent by $700 over a 3 month span and stopped including heat/hot water, with a notice that said \"I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience, unfortunately we have to take this route due to lack of income\". So basically because they were hard up during an already hard enough time for everyone, they decided to completely fuck over all of their tenents (they own over 10 rental properties and they raised everyone's rent by this much). We are the last remaining of all the tenants she had and they are currently renovating all the apartments in to section 8 approved housing. I'm leaving here in a week because I can not afford $3200 a month on top of heat, electric and hot water (another easily $600 a month). \n\nBy law I have to be given a 24hr written notice for them to enter the property. They have been showing up here for the past 2 days with maintenance crews because they want to start fixing the place up for section 8 approval with us still here, trying to pack our shit. I have outright refused them entry. I have multiple reasons honestly. One is petty reasons; I'm pissed I have to uproot my kids (that's a me problem, I'm willing to admit), two is the fact that I don't want these people anywhere near my shit and potentially ruining it with their renovations, and three I don't want them around me or my kids. There's like 4 or 5 random guys that she keeps trying to bring in my home while my husband is off working and I'm home alone with our 3 young daughters. They can wait a week until I'm gone, is how I see it. \n\nThe landlord is pitching an absolute fit because she will never be approved for clearance to start renovations with a family still living in the apartment, without having to pay for us to be put up in a hotel room, so she's fully expecting me to just cave because \"this is the only time maintenance has time to do it, as they won't be available next week\". I told her that's absolutely not my problem at all. She did end up leaving here crying saying if she doesn't get this done now, she will likely lose her rental properties and all her income because she hasn't been able to afford her mortgage in months and is currently under threat of foreclosure.
