Mostly we hosted my family as Jake\u2019s family lives out of town and couldn\u2019t come in this year. But, Jake\u2019s mother \u201cKathy,\u201d (60F) joined us, and it was the first time she was meeting a lot of my family. \n\nFor context, Jake and I grew up with very different norms and expectations regarding politeness. Kathy is incredibly conservative and religious, and absolutely hates swearing and alcohol. I\u2019m always very respectful of this at her house, even though it was a difficult adjustment for me because I wasn\u2019t used to monitoring my language in that way, and sometimes didn\u2019t even realize I was doing it. If it slipped, I would always apologize. I also made sure to never drink if I knew I was going to her house. \n\nHowever, at my house this year, I chose not to tell my entire family that they need to watch their language or celebrate differently around her. I made sure that she didn\u2019t have a past with alcoholism first, but after being told it was just her own personal preference I had Jake tell her in advance what to expect, and let her know that we would be totally OK celebrating with her separately on a different day if she didn\u2019t want to come. But she chose to show up. I should also preface here that no one gets excessively drunk. As a host, I do take the responsibility of making sure everyone remains safe and still has fun, but I don\u2019t want to police their celebration either. My brother, \u201cZach\u201d (25M), while watching football and having a few beers, in my opinion, didn\u2019t cross the line, but definitely used some language that made Kathy uncomfortable.\n\nPersonally, I apologized to Kathy. But I didn\u2019t tell my brother he needed to stop or apologize himself. Kathy later sent me a text expressing that I was TA for this, ruining the \u201choliday spirit\u201d by allowing bad language and alcohol. She said that Zach was out of line, and I should\u2019ve cut off the alcohol after his first beer if he \u201ccan\u2019t act appropriately.\u201d I asked Jake about this, and he said I\u2019m NTA, that even growing up the way he did he didn\u2019t see anything wrong with Zach\u2019s behavior. I\u2019m conflicted because I\u2019m aware she was a guest in my home, but so was everyone else, and I felt it would\u2019ve been far more wrong to make everyone uncomfortable by making them feel like they\u2019re doing something wrong by celebrating the way we always do. Jake now thinks his mom is TA, and that she\u2019s just upset deep down that he\u2019s going to marry someone who isn\u2019t religious. I don\u2019t want to have bad blood with my future MIL, but I also don\u2019t want to set the expectation that I\u2019ll become a different person for her.

You will need to have a long talk with your partner about what will happen in the future.

I suggest setting certain expectations on what kind of lines you are going to draw with your MIL and ensure that your partner is going to support you in those.", "No offense but your fiance needs to deal with his own shit AKA his mother.

She can't expect everyone else in the world to accommodate her religious feelings or feelings in general. It's a party with mixed company, so she's being dramatic.", "NTA. Kathy can celebrate elsewhere in the future. You're under no obligation to ask your entire family to accommodate her pearl-clutching, puritanical sensibilities.", "NTA\n\n>Kathy later sent me a text expressing that I was TA for this, ruining the \u201choliday spirit\u201d by allowing bad language and alcohol\n\nOkay, Ms Buzzkillington! She was a guest and had no right to police anyone's language.", "You're on a good path to making sure your FMIL knows that she does not run YOUR house!\n\nNTA", "Nta overall, but Zach was a little uncouth. I don't think anyone should be dropping fbombs around a new person. Yes, Kathy probably is a tight ass, still, because they had just met, it's overly familiar to behave that way in front of her. You did a good job of keeping many plates in the air. Looks like separate celebrations are the way of the future", "NTA\n\nEven Jake thinks you are right here so you shouldn't second guess yourself too much. \n\nIf you must respond - I think it should be up to Jake to handle his mum but you know your relationship best - I think you should let her know that your family are who they are and you love them as they are. In the same way you wouldn't ask her to tone down her faith to make your family more comfortable, you shouldn't be expected to stop your brother from having a reasonable amount of alcohol and tone himself down while watching the game. That she is welcome to join your family at events and tolerate the difference. Or y'all can see each other separately from now on.\n\nAlso, as someone else has mentioned - what's the plan for y'all's wedding? That will be interesting since most people drink more at a wedding.", "NTA - Assuming she was warned about the use of swear words (I know there was an alcohol warning) then her getting offended is completely on her. She was told what to expect, and if she didn't like it that you guys could do it another day. She chose to come and therefore she should have accepted whatever with grace.", "You shouldn't have to change your own or your families behavior for your future MIL.  Your family is who they are, her presence shouldn't matter.  I'm a conservative Christian but would never tell someone they need to change their behavior because of MY beliefs.  My siblings are mostly alcoholics and drug users (except one brother) and I just choose not to be around them because I know they're going to act in ways I wouldn't.  Jake is correct, his mom is the A H.  NTA on your part.", "Edit - NTA.\n\nIN.FO - what was your brother actually doing that made Kathy so upset?", "NTA. It isn't up to Kathy to police other adults. She can't expect the world to abide by her choices.", "I personally find it jarring and rude when people are swearing left and right and dropping f bombs. But I wouldn't be texting hosts about it and I would value an important relationship more than another guest's language. There are more important things than being the language police. NTA.", "NTA, your MIL needs to lighten up and understand that the world doesn't bend to her.  You told her there would be drinking and gave her an alternative option.  She still chose to come.\n\nNo fault on your part at all.", "NTA.  It was not her house and she is not the queen who decides how everything is.  There is no god given right to never be uncomfortable.  And no one has ever died from hearing an f bomb.", "NTA - you took steps to ensure she was \u201cwarned\u201d that your family celebrates differently than what she is accustomed to, and she is TA for imposing her personal beliefs and expectations on your family. It also sounds like no one drank to excess or put her in an unsafe situation. You\u2019re probably right that this is about more than some swear words and alcohol, but it sounds like Jake has your back, which is the most important thing here - that you 2 remain a united front. The \u201choliday spirit\u201d is about gathering together and including the people most important to you in your celebration. You did that, and her hang-ups aren\u2019t your responsibility. I\u2019ve also learned as a married person, sometimes it takes time to get extended family together in one place comfortably, as much as that is the goal or ideal scenario that everyone gets along every holiday. You did nothing wrong, but maybe your extended family\u2019s celebratory habits are too incompatible for future joint celebrations. It\u2019ll be up to you and Jake to set those boundaries together in the future, and for him to stick up for you as you merge your lives.", "NTA you were a good host. You had more guests than your MIL and she was warned in advance and offered a different date to celebrate.\n\nThe only thing you should change is having a drink if you want to. Do not allow her to customise your life to suit her ideals.", "NTA.  Your MIL is \"The Church Lady\".", "NTA your brother is an adult.", "NTA. The world doesn't revolve around her and she has no control stepping into someome else's house.", "NTA. She was given a heads up on what to expect and she showed up anyway.  That's on her.  While you want all of your guests to be comfortable in your home, you can't ask everybody to toe the line simply to suit her.", "NTA but now you know the future MiL is one to minimize contact with. Especially if you have kids at some point.", "NTA. One person doesn't get to dictate the conditions of a whole family just by showing up and demanding it. She knew what she was getting into and she could have chosen to stay away if it would bother her that much.", "NTA It sounds like you handled this in a very good way, balancing many things while trying to respect everyone as best you could while allowing for differences; Jake's mother sounds like she is projecting herself onto you as if she expects you to act as she would if she were in your place -- but you are not her and you don't have her thinking or exact values. Of course you shouldn't have to act as she would act if she were the host.\n\nJake's mother may have started out intending to have an open mind, but ended up slipping back into expecting others to live by her values when it came to the crunch and something offended her sensibilities.\n\nUnless you plan to sacrifice the balance in your relationship with your own family in order to act like your MIL's \"mini-me\" when she's around, MIL will have to get used to the fact that her values don't reign in other people's houses and that her DIL can't be expected to live by MIL's rules in her own house. MIL only gets to lay down her version of the law in her own house and she will have to get used to that.", "For context, I didn\u2019t apologize when she texted me. I haven\u2019t responded yet. I apologized in the moment, because I noticed her sitting there kind of awkwardly, so it was kind of like \u201csorry, these guys get really into their football\u201d and the we went out to the kitchen to chat. Really I just tried to cut the tension, but with it being my first time hosting anything, I really had no idea how to handle the situation.", "It's a good time to follow up with \"My house, my fucking rules\"", "Honestly, I hate the idea of a wedding. We\u2019re probably going to elope and spend that money on an incredible honeymoon instead. I\u2019m more so worried about the relationship long-term. She doesn\u2019t have to be my best friend, but having her not hate me will make my life easier moving forward if that\u2019s a possibility.", "He was yelling at the TV and dropping a few F bombs. Like, \u201cLet\u2019s f-ing go! Come on!\u201d It definitely got a little bit loud, essentially imagine how someone would behave in any sports bar watching a game. I\u2019ve tried to figure out if anything else happened, but that\u2019s as far as I know.", "This actually makes a lot of sense to me. I was really confused as to why she would show up (I honestly expected her to say no), so that definitely gives me a little bit more perspective if she did go into it trying to be open minded. Having been in her shoes in reverse, it\u2019s a hard transition, because it\u2019s so opposite. This gives me some ground to discuss and maybe try to mend things even if we\u2019ll never be on the exact same page. Thank you for your perspective!", "OK, so I adjust my comment:  You handled it perfectly, no reservations, no 'buts'. \n\n>I really had no idea how to handle the situation.\n\nWell you sure got it right even so.", "I am sure that for a tight-ass Church Lady ^TM like her, that would be more than enough to have her clutching her pearls and collapsing onto the chaise-longue. If you'd had a chaise-longue that is.", "You're welcome. :)", ">  I was really confused as to why she would show up \n\nSo she could judge you. So she could take her judgement home and complain about you and your \"[insert slur here]\" family, so as to try and persuade Jake to dump you. This was not, repeat NOT, an attempt to get to know your family as future inlaws. She chose quite specifically to visit on the one day she believed you'd all be drunk and \"behaving badly\". This was a deliberate, hostile, calculated act of sabotage.\n\nShe is your enemy. She wants your relationship with Jake to fail and will do whatever is necessary. Treat her accordingly from now on.", "What are you trying to mend? You did nothing wrong. You are pandering to her though. NTA and I don't think that you should have apologised for normal behaviour that occurred in your house. Talk to your partner and see how he would like to proceed. Start as you mean to go on.", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand it when people go into others houses and try to impose their rules. \n\nSome people are just sour like that. It\u2019s not her house and she doesn\u2019t have to visit again.", "NTA and you are fine. If your possibly future MIL decides to not like you because you aren't policing everyone's actions then that is a her problem. You are respectful to her in her house and are aware of how you act around her again because you are respecting her. \n\nBut she isn't respecting you back when she was warned about how your family is and instead of choosing not to come she CHOSE to come and then had the audacity to come at you about someone's behavior in YOUR house. The majority shouldn't have to change/accommodate  for 1 person.", "She was informed that her ways aren't yours and she still chose to join.\n\nYou adapt when you are at your place, her chritisizing is an insult to you and your family.\n\n*<Personally, I apologized to Kathy*. >\n\nWHY?\n\nNTA", "Your ability to control her opinion of you is very limited. \n\nIf she\u2019s already upset that her son has chosen a non-religious partner whose family drinks and swears, she\u2019s not likely to have a good relationship with you regardless. That\u2019s not necessarily a pass to treat her coldly, but I do think you need to take some pressure off of yourself when it comes to impressing her. You can be polite and friendly without being overly eager to please. She is who she is, but so are you, and her son has chosen *you* as his partner in life. She has at least as much incentive to make a good impression on *you* as you do on her.", "What DiTrastevere said.\n\nYou can't do much to change how your MIL (or anyone else for that matter) feels about you when the things she dislikes are things that are out of your control. Be kind to yourself (and your family) and accept that the issue is with MIL's world view. And since you can't change who you or your family are, and since your husband is on your side, the relationship with MIL will be what it will be. \n\nBetter than bending over backwards to try and please her only to realize you'll never win unless you become a whole different person. Aim for a \"civil\" relationship and if you get \"friendly\" it will be a bonus."]}
