He's a mechanic who started out in the parts room not knowing a thing about the trucks and has now worked his way up to being the service foreman. In the last 3 years he's managed to turn the business around from barely staying afloat off of their regular customers to needing to hire more mechanics with all the new clients they've brought in. He even taught himself how to run reports, process inventory, and handle the business and numbers aspect as well. He's extremely passionate about what he does, he puts at least 60 hours in every week, and he looks forward to owning the company one day and passing it down to our children.\n\nHis father (Jimmy), the current general manager and son of Big Jim, does not share this passion. To him it has always been just a job that he'll inherit from his dad when he passes away and inevitably sell. He has no knowledge of how to actually service the vehicles so all he runs currently are the business ends of things (phone calls, service write ups, scheduling, etc.) and for about 4 months out of the year he travels so my husband runs it solo while he isnt there. \n\nMy husband's parents have talked extensively about how they can't wait to sell the business the minute Big Jim passes so that they can take the money and move to a big house down south, thus ridding themselves of the burden of running the shop but also robbing my husband of one day inheriting the business that he worked so hard to improve.\n\nA few months ago when Big Jim came up to visit, my husband sat him down to break this news to him. His grandpa was devastated to hear that his own son doesn't want to keep the company he started in the family to pass on for generations. My husband suggested putting our names into the will so that it skips his dad and goes directly to him instead to keep it alive and in the family he loves so dearly. And his grandpa did just that.\n\nA few days ago my husband's parents found out about this and they are LIVID. They said that we are greedy for what is theirs by birthright and that Jimmy had been working there for forty years as opposed to my husband's less than 10 years. Apparantly we had no business going above them because they didn't like what they were going to do with the shop and that it's none of our business. It had always been set aside for them in the will and they're saying we should be disgusted with ourselves for ruining their retirement.\n\nSo my husband wants to know, AITA?\n\n**EDIT: I wanted to clear this up since I've seen a lot of comments regarding this: Jimmy is not cut-out of the will, he just isn't getting the company. Big Jim is very wealthy and owns multiple vacation properties in the US. My in-laws are definitely getting a sizable amount of money as Jimmy is his only son and I'm willing to bet that he'll also inherit one of the vacation homes since he likes to travel down south so much.  Big Jim didn't disown his son, he loves him very much, but he wants his life's achievement to live on beyond his passing and he thinks the best way to have that legacy is through his grandson, my husband. My in-laws won't be left high and dry, they just won't be able to have it ALL.**", "created_utc": 1680022486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124v2t5/aita_for_asking_my_grandfather_to_hand_the_family/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure your husband's grandpa would be more than happy to keep the business in the family, than watch it be sold. As a GM his dad isn't doing much anyway other than making sure the building is up to code and there aren't any serious issues. \n\nHowever, it sounds like your step mother also vastly overestimates her worth as it's not even HER birthright. The grandfather is still alive, and has a right to change his will to whatever he wants to keep his best interest in mind.", "NTA all your husband did was give his grandfather all the pertinent information. It\u2019s his business that he built and it\u2019s his choice who it goes to. Your in-laws are wrong in thinking they have a birthright to things your grandfather worked for. Selling a business is not a retirement fund. SS and pension is what working gets you. Not an inheritance.", "NTA.

Disgruntled employees are a liability.", "NTA. Grandfather deserved to know what was going to happen to the company he worked so hard to create, and he deserves to know that it's going to be in loving hands.

It's Big Jims decision. You didn't lie or exaggerate anything to make yourselves look better. You simply told Big Jim something he absolutely would have wanted to know.", "NTA - Whether anybody likes it or not, this is purely your grandfather's decision, and it sounds like he was appreciative to learn of his son's intentions since they do not align with your grandfather's vision.", "What did Big Jim say when your husband approached him with the idea?", "NTA:  Grandpa is still alive and can change his will at any time.  The AH here are his son and wife (your inlaws) who basically lied by omission about their plans to sell the business and ghoulishly anticipating the death of a relative to have his assets.  Given how morally bankrupt they seem in this story they aren't entitled to grandpas money and frankly don't really seem like they deserve it.", "NTA. At the end of the day, it\u2019s the Grandpa\u2019s decision. You gave him all the information to make an informed decision of what will happen to the business he created. That was a fair, honest and kind thing to do. \nBest wishes to the Grandpa, he sounds like a good, hardworking and passionate person.", "NTA\n\nIt's the grandfather's business to know what the intentions are of whoever he's passing on the business to if he cared about such information (and he clearly did).

Heads up: the better you make the business, the more valuable it will be. I think that you husband's parents don't know how businesses are valued. It is 3 times cash flow: profit, salary and benefits to the owner. If they use company money to fund the four months of travel, most buyers won't compensate them for that. What I'm saying is that if those costs are buried in the P&L and then the tax return, buyers won't let you \"steal it twice\".\n\nEverybody needs to go to a lawyer and a financial planner. If dad wanted to cash out, he should have worked harder on making the business successful. He did get a paycheck for 40 years. To me that seems like a great thing. Why couldn't 40 years of savings fund a retirement? Maybe travel for 2 months instead of 4?  Again - he could have made the business more successful.", "NTA. Grandfather\u2019s shop, grandfather\u2019s decision. Big Jim clearly sees that his grandson has a passion and knack for running the business, and knows that it will be in good hands after he passes. He ultimately wants to have it go to someone who values the business as more than just a monetary asset, and the grandson clearly does. The fact that Jimmy has been working there for longer than his son and believes that it should go to him is inconsequential. Big Jim owns the business, so he can leave it to whoever he wants.", "INFO why didn\u2019t you guys try to have a family conversation about this with the parents and grandparent involved? Otherwise, it does read like you went behind their backs to cut them out.", "NTA. No one has a company as a birth right.", "NTA\n\nHe can ask.

He also was the one to suggest being put in the will instead over his father, when he stands to hugely gain financially from that decision. Especially depending on how old the grandfather is, advocating to receive a larger inheritance than other parties, without talking or involving the other parties, by essentially bad mouthing them, is pretty not great.\n\nI'd feel manipulated and weirded out as well. **Why didn't your husband ask his father, the general manager and at that moment inheritor of the business, to be part of the conversation with his grandfather about what would happen to the business and what the grandfather wanted?** The inheritance of the family business will be the biggest financial decision happening to your entire family. \n\nI imagine your husband's father telling his story to reddit, of how he has worked dutifully for his father for 4 decades, at a job he doesn't really like but is proud of the business he built with his father. It has been his whole working life. He is second in command, the general manager, and has brought his son into the business, helped teach him how it works, promoted him again and again, worked in lockstep with your grandfather for years to get him up to speed and primed for success as you wind down towards retirement.\n\nThen he finds out one day that the windfall that he admittedly irresponsibly planned for is gone, without a chance to defend himself, because his son had a conversation with his father about how he hates the business and would sell and ruin it the moment he died, insinuated that the only way to carry on his legacy was to give it to him instead. His elderly father believed this wholesale and signed it over without talking to him first, which has set up a legal battle for years once he dies because his son didn't even involve him and voice his concerns or ask if he could buy it out or work with him, before speaking to his grandfather.", "NAH. \n\nThese situations are always difficult and I don't feel like there's a right answer. It's simply up to your grandfather to choose. The reason why I chose NAH is because I think it's understandable to want to keep a family business in the family. Your husband has worked hard and helped turn the place around and there's nothing wrong with worrying about your guys' future. On the other hand, I don't think your in laws are wrong either. Your father in-law has worked there for 40 years expecting to get the business and sell it to retire. It's possible he gave up other career options or prospects to help his father run the business. He likely resents the business to a certain degree.", "INFO: why can\u2019t you buy the business from your FIL? Have a succession plan in place and rather than getting a loan from the bank make payments to the father directly. That way the father gets credit for his 40 years and his expected buyout and your husband still gets to by owner of the business he is passionate about. It seems the most fair since your father in law has put in a lot of years and I can understand it upsetting him that he is being skipped over in the will.", "YTA.  Your FIL has worked there for 40 years and had his retirement planned out based on what his father and employer had promised and your husband essentially completely cut him off at the knees.  No retirement, nothing but food stamps and social security after 40 years.  Your husband could have bought out his parents, his grandfather could have willed the company to both of them.  Lots of options here that don't leave his parents in the cold for the rest of their lives.", "Yeah you are the asshole.  It goes from father to children or child and then to their child.

In his mind inheriting the shop and then selling was always his way out regardless if his son started working there or not. It's very likely he feels that your husband is young enough to get another job and still be successful or even stay at the shop and continue working.

Yall did the right thing.", "Let's be real, FIL only worked at his dad's company for 40 years because it was an easy nepotism screw around job. How many jobs give you four months of vacation a year or don't expect you to know the company. It's not a giant business with a CEO, it's a garage. The General Manager should actually know about the service side. The dad is a glorified secretary and doesn't even want to do that. And they don't even need him because the grandson covers for him for months at a time. \n\nFair to leave it to the grandson and I think the grandfather made the right call. Why should the grandson, who also put in time and much more effort, and is building the business, get f'd over because dad is whinging. Son already has a million dollar house. \n\nGrandfather was presented with both sides and went with grandson. That's how it is. NTA.", "NTA. Big Jim is not dead.

But be prepared for a huge fight when the tine comes so hope jims will is bulletproof...also be wary of dad sabotaging the business out of spite...hopefully that wont be the case since it would also sabotage his retirement plans if he did get his way.", "There is no such thing as a birthright. NTA.", "NTA. Big Jim (great name for a mechanic) made a decision based on the truth. They were lying to him this whole time looking for a payday. It was always his business and his choice.", "Just make sure that the will is airtight, and be ready for some major shenanigans.", "This is a hard one for me.\n\n Just because their dreams of retirement don't match what you want doesn't mean they're wrong. Many people want to retire to a warm climate and live out their years not working, and enjoying life.\n\nYour FIL has been working for his father in the family business for 40 years. His whole working life has been spent working for his Dad. It was probably expected of him whether he wanted to run the business or not. He's been waiting for his chance to have his retirement, just like his father has done. You have stripped him of his inheritance and I know I wouldn't be happy with you.\n\nOn the other hand your husband has made this business successful and wants to build it even bigger and I can see why the grandfather would want that to happen. \n\nI honestly don't see an AH here. NAH.\n\nBut I see your In-laws not forgiving you and I understand why they would feel this way. I feel bad for everyone concerned.", "op=nta as presented.\n\nyour husband didn't force grandfather, Plus the value of the business has to have increased by a large degree if he's been responsible for the expansion.\n\nPerhaps, instead of inheriting,  Grandfather should give him a percentage of the business during while still alive based on the increase.  So if your husband has increased business/value 10% give him 10%.... etc\n\nThen Grandfather could leave the business in whatever proportion he wants between son and grandson.  With partner having a RIGHT of first refusal if one wants to sell--AND that it has to be done in a fashion that can be reasonably subsidized(ie payments or loan).  \n\nSo let's say your Husband gets 20% ownership now.  And then it's split 40% each after Grandfather passes.  Then dad wants to sell his 40%, Husband gets rights to purchase first(at a market assessed value).  And he can do it in payments rather than lump sum(unless husband can get a loan).\n\nThe alternative is for your husband to express that he cannot afford to piss away his life on a job that is going to be sold out from under him and that he'll need to seek employment elsewhere(or start own business).\n\nSince Husband has made the business More valuable, his leaving would likely mean the value of business will go down and that Daddy dearest won't be able to sell it for the lovely moola he's greedily planning on NOW.", "NTA\n\nNothing should be considered a \"birthright\"... You are not entitled to anything in life. Dad had '40 years' to seek a different job that fit in laws plans of retirement. It's selfish they have planned to sell a business that means so much to grandpa without a second thought. If Big Jim wants the business to stay in the family and go to grandson, then it should be. Unfortunately greed doesn't set up your future for success. Bummer.", "NTA. \n\nbut legally you need to make sure the will and deed to the property goes to your husband and is air tight. Because depending on the type of title your grandfather has, it could make the will void and will go to his next heir which would be the fil. \n\nSo you should talk to grandpa and make sure everything is good so it passes directly to uour husband. Or have him transfer it now instead if waiting until death. \n\nOtherwise the will could be void and it may go to fil.", "NTA. It\u2019s Big Jim\u2019s choice who gets the business. Your husband didn\u2019t manipulate him, he just gave him the truth about the situation. Big Jim made that choice.\n\nAnd with your edit, NTA!!!! Your father in law is greedy. He\u2019s likely inheriting more money than many people will ever have in their life, and because they can\u2019t have more they\u2019re upset?\n\nIt\u2019s like getting mad for not being given a family heirloom when you only wanted it to sell it. Give it to someone who will cherish it.", "Maybe it would be better for Big Jim to turn over the business to OP's husband while he's still alive? I'd be afraid of an ugly court battle from the parents over the will.", "Any beef Mom and Dad have is with Big Jim.\n\nBig Jim clearly wants this to be an ongoing family business. Mom and Dad just want the dollars. Too bad for Mom and Dad.", "This is like the difference between nepotism and *nepotism.* OP's husband is emotionally invested in the family business, worked his way up, educated himself on multiple facets of the business so that he can run it efficiently and improve the business. It's still nepotism because he'll still get ownership of it because he's Big Jim's grandson, but he actually cares about the legacy. Jimmy has been punching a timeclock there for 40 years but hasn't bothered to expand his knowledge outside of his specific job description, hasn't tried to expand the business, and is ready to sell it as soon as his dad dies so he can retire in luxury. This is the worst kind of *nepotism* where someone who is barely qualified gets to run the place (into the ground apparently) and then expects sell it off for a big payout just because he's Big Jim's son. \n\nIn this day and age it's irresponsible to your employees to engage in the kind of *nepotism* Jimmy expects.", "I see what your point is here, but I want to clarify that they aren't digging grandpa's grave here getting ready to push him in for the cash flow. We all love Big Jim very very much, so I don't think there is any real menacing intent behind them wanting to sell and run with the cash, I think that they just don't want to run the company and want to sell it. The issue is that they have no problem spiting their son in the process and taking his hard work and years of efforts and handing it wrapped in a bow to someone else.", "We have actually talked to the in-laws about this and they declined. For one, we're in our 20s so this isn't something we could afford to buy outright at this point. (This is a multi-million dollar company). Their plans are not to find the buyer with the most cash on hand and sell it to them within the first 1-3 years of inheriting it so that they can live out their retirement in a brand new, beautiful southern home. We simply can't afford to outbid that. \n\nOur in-laws are thinking of themselves only, and that's fair enough because that's what my husband and I are doing as well. Prioritizing OUR family and career(s). But they aren't willing to negotiate with us to even have a plan set in place.", "He definitely has. And his dad doesn't do NOTHING per se, but he definitely doesn't do as much as my husband and still gets paid more than him. Fair enough, since he's been there 4 times as long, but it's the principle of it. He's rarely there, gets paid a ton, and if my son inherits the business it's not like he loses all of that. He can keep his same job, keep traveling, keep his salary, etc. But if he sells and we're under new ownership, everything could change for my husband.", "Jimmy 100% kept this from his father, my in-laws would tell us all the time \"don't tell this to grandpa\" which like, he definitely breached their trust that I understand is kinda fucked up. But nonetheless, it's the truth and it's shady. I think some of the reason they're so mad is because their secret wasn't kept and they look like assholes now.", "While I do agree that my husband could've approached this a bit more diplomatically, Jimmy did also have a private talk with his father about this issue when he found out about this and as it currently stands, we are still getting the business. So he couldn't have made much of a case in his favor. If it happens to \"get taken\" from us and \"given back\" to his parents, fine fair enough. But Big Jim is still very much alive and Jimmy can negotiate and plead his case from his personal side just as my husband did as long as he is still with us, so this \"not being able to defend himself\" just simply isn't true. \n\nIt's not like we made up lies about him, these ARE his plans. He WILL sell if he gets the company. My husband didn't go into the conversation with his grandfather proposal first and arguments about his father wanting to sell to back it up. He told him he's going to sell, Jim wasn't happy, my husband saw an opportunity to keep it in the family and proposed it. \n\nOf course we stand to gain a lot from this inheritance. But Big Jim is loaded and we'd likely get a hefty lump some of money in the will regardless. That's not what this is about. Sure it's a major plus, but the issue here is that my husband put in double the work his father did to essentially build this company up to the status it has today and to have it sold where he would have to clock in and clock out and as just another employee. To see what he built up just handed to the highest bidder is heartbreaking to him. \n\nThe difference here is that at this point my husband feels that he has earned the company as opposed to Jimmy feeling like he's entitled to it simply due to the time spent there rather than what he really did with that time there.", "No it definitely does appear that way, and after reading the comments that is the appropriate route that probably should've been taken. But it definitely wasn't a conspiracy to spite his parents, he loves his parents very much. But at the end of the day, my husband has his own family to worry about now and a lifelong career that he's been working toward, so he has to think of his own wellbeing, too. \n\nIf Jimmy was going to inherit the business, keep it, and then pass it to my husband 30-40 years then we wouldn't be having this conversation. It's the fact that if my in-laws sell, they are going against the wishes of Big Jim and they're also fucking my husband out of inheriting something he's passionate about and passing that onto our boys.\n\nBig Jim is loaded, so even if we do get the company there's no way my in-laws will just get stiffed. He'll morr than likely leave his only son a hefty lump some of cash that they can move down south with. They just want us much as they can possibly get, even if that would spite their own son.", "So Grandpa did entertain the idea of giving my husband 51% of shares and Jimmy 50%, but in the end chose not to. My husband didn't convince his grandfather to do anything really, he made the choice himself. My in-laws certainly aren't cut out of the will, they're likely going to inherit one of Big Jim's many vacation properties and a large sum of cash since he's pretty wealthy and Jimmy is his only son, they just won't have it ALL like they want.", "Well that's just it, his grandfather *could've* split it between my husband and his son and just given my husband 51% of shares if he really wanted to. But he chose not to. We didn't convince Jim to cut then out, they're still in it for a hefty lump some of cash. Jimmy is his only son and Jim is loaded, so they'll be fine. They just won't have it ALL. \n\nBeing left in the cold is a far cry from what their lives would look like even if they didn't get a penny from Jim. They are rather wealthy and live in a luxurious home and take multiple vacations a year. Whether my husband gets the company or not, he is saving for retirement. If my MIL chooses not to work (she has been unemployed by choice for over 20 years) and my FIL didn't out anything away for retirement, that isn't my husband's our our family's problem.", "This is my main reason for posting here really. Because I do kinda feel like an asshole for \"ruining\" their retirement. If I worked somewhere for more half my life with the assumption that it would be mine one day just to have it taken from me, I'd be pissed. But I also don't feel bad because if they chose not to save for retirement their entire lives because they were banking on this business that isn't our family's problem. \n\nWhat if the business went under in '08? Or during 2020? They got hit pretty hard both of those times and had it failed they would've been fucked then too. It's just not smart to put all of their eggs in the basket of this company and that I can't sympathize with. \n\nThey won't be left high and dry, Grandpa is loaded and owns multiple vacation properties. Maybe they'll get one of those. They're definitely getting a big lump some of money since Jimmy is his only son, so I hardly think they'll be suffering. They just won't have ALL of what they want, which I think is fine because their son, who they should hopefully be wanting the best for, will be able to continue his life running a company in his dream career.", "You know, it\u2019s not evil to to stay at home. And it\u2019s not evil to think that you\u2019ll be left your father\u2019s business - as had been arranged to happen all your life and married life up until now. That didn\u2019t come out of nowhere, it\u2019s what they were taught to expect by your grandfather. You are acting like they are villains for not wanting to run the business and being surprised at being disinherited. Guess what? It hurts and is scary to suddenly realize your financial plans for retirement have been upended because your parent skipped you over.", "At least you won\u2019t ever see them again. You for the business you wanted but hope you understand the cost.", "\"they can't wait to sell the business the minute Big Jim passes\"\n\nThat kinda sounds like they can't wait until he dies they way you wrote this.  The MINUTE?  Like not even time to grieve at all?  I'll take your word for it, since it's your family, but again the way this was written makes your FIL/MIL sound pretty evil.", "I hope he made sure the will is ironclad, including proof of mental competency.  His son may try to attack that based on his age.", "This is why Big Jim should give your husband some ownership now--because he's increased the value of the business(substantially).  \n\nOtherwise, if there is a chance the business can be sold out from under him--staying where he is may not be the wise choice.  At least, there should be some agreement for first buy option.", "Yea, running a place for 40 years and getting demonized for taking vacations and not wanting to put in 60 hours+ a week while 60~ years old.\n\nWay to break up the entire family, why not just offer to buy him out of the business?", "Exactly. Jimmy has all the opportunity in the world to plead his personal case to his father, but he just isn't. Or if he is, he isn't saying anything that Big Jim likes the sound of because as it stands my husband is still in the will to inherit the business.", ">if they chose not to save for retirement their entire lives because they were banking on this business that isn't our family's problem.  \n>  \n>What if the business went under in '08? Or during 2020? They got hit pretty hard both of those times and had it failed they would've been fucked then too.\n\nBut your FIL kept it running during 08. He didn't let it fail and he kept it going all those years. He didn't work there half his life, he worked there his whole working life if he's been there for 40 years. And the business WAS his investment for his retirement. He certainly didn't think his son was going to undermine him and take it away. \n\nI honestly think the Grandfather should arrange to give it to his son, your FIL and then work out a way for your husband to buy it from him. The FIL gets his inheiritance and your husband ends up with a money making business. That way no one gets screwed.", "No and that I understand. They can be as upset as they want, I understand the devastation and I don't think thats what is so evil. What is is expecting that daddy passes the business to you simply because you spend a lot of time there and then fucking your OWN son out of having the same joys that you expect for yourself. It's hypocritical imo. \n\nIt's also not evil to stay at home, I agree, but it is when you're her lmao. There's only so much context you can put into a reddit post but my MIL is insufferable. She once told me she hopes I get in a life-altering car accident because I told her she's not supposed to mix rum with sleeping pills. She beat all of her children. We eloped and didn't invite her (or anyone) so she told me she hopes to God that I never have children because I'm selfish and would make a horrible mother and that of we DID conceive, she would call CPS on us. Her staying home in a million dollar house and not working so that she can reap the benefits of her husband's business while complaining all the while that \"they don't have enough money\" is what I find to be heinous.", "Agreed\n\nand he ran it for 40 years", "It's fine by me, she was never very nice to me as it is. Haven't talked to her in quite some time lol.", "Well then that was an exaggeration on my part. But their goal is within the first year which is pretty immediate in my opinion. Evil, no. Fucked up, sure.", "You know I hadn't really thought of it in this context and now I'm more mad lmao. I try to give my in-laws the benefit of the doubt in that since I know for a fact he never really wanted to work for the company, he probably always had it in his mind to sell it off, but now I'm sure this is why they're THIS mad about it. It wasn't worth *nothing* before, but it's definitely worth faaaar more now.", "He's still sharp as a tack, thats how he's managed to make it to 94 lol. He works out, he still comes to the shop from time to time to help work on things, etc. \n\nListen, at the end ofnthe day if he does decide to give the business to his only son, then so be it. They'll sell it and pocket the cash and my husband will be devastated that his hard work was all given away to the highest bidder, but we'll survive. We're still young and have plenty of time to either buy back the company one day or maybe open our own. Who knows? But my husband would be much happier to inherit the business that he thinks of as a second home.", "I'll say this, Jimmy had been working for his dad since he was 18 or 20. Long before he met his wife, my MIL. My MIL is the one thats reeeeeally up in arms over this because SHE'S the one who wants to buy a nice house down south and sell it. For the most part, Jimmy is a rather modest man. He shops at Walmart for everything despite having the funds to do otherwise, he's pretty frugal and likes to coupon, etc. His wife that doesn't work (and honestly, wears the pants in the marriage) is the one that is up in arms over this and by default, since he loves his wife and gives her whatever she wants, now so is Jimmy. That's not to say he isn't also kind of ticked off at his son for doing this, but the main aggressor here is my MIL. So who knows, this could be a recent development in Jimmy's plans to make his wife happy or it could've been the plan since the start. I can't say.", "But this is exactly correct, he isn't proud of the business. He takes off for months at a time because he hates being there and in the 40 years he's worked there never showed any interest in actually learning about the service side of the business. Big Jim has told us this many times in a group setting with the whole family, that he just was never that interested in it and actually tried to quit multiple times in his early 20s.  We all laugh about it together when it's brought up, but Jimmy has never denied this. Big Jim just never thought he would actually SELL the entire thing outright. \n\nNow sure, maybe he takes off all of that time because he CAN now that his son (my husband) can run it on his own. Who would really choose to work over being able to vacation for months at a time. But I'll tell you, in the 6 years I've been with my husband, we have never taken more than 1 week's worth of vacation together every other year and this man never takes a sick day because he is just that passionate about the shop and what he does. He actually does love working for the family and just loves being a mechanic. He repairs our friend's cars for free and even purchases old beater cars to repair for fun. His father had 40 years to invest his time and effort into this and chooses not to. He simply does not enjoy it like my husband and Big Jim do. For this reason, he HAS to be the general manager because he has zero knowledge of how to perform a service. Whereas my husband took it upon himself to educate him on both aspects of what it takes to successfully run this business.", "This is true, he did keep it running in '08 so I'll give him that. But keeping something running isn't the same as making something grow and become more profitable like my husband has done in his time there. \n\nI'm definitely going to sound like a whiney baby for a minute here, but why should my husband have to spend millions to buy the company that *he* made so profitable. Thanks to him, the company is worth this much to sell. Why doesn't my FIL have to buy it from his father? Idk, it just doesn't seem fair to my husband after he out in all this work when my FIL can't even be bothered to learn how to do a brake job for the company he wants ownership of so bad.", "Yea as someone whose family owned an auto shop this is disgusting levels of posts.\n\nThe amount of work to keep a shop from going under in 08 would have been staggering. Same as during COVID.\n\nIts good they are flourishing now but speaking from experience \"only running a business\" isn't easier than turning wrenches.", "So this whole thing was also for revenge ?", "He worked there for 40 years - which is not the same as running it - and it sounds as though he wasn't particularly driven to see it succeed when he was running it.\n\nJimmy is absolutely allowed to his disappointment that his plans for the future don't seem to be panning out, but that seems to be due in large part to ignoring his father's wishes for what will happen to the business.", "It could easily become worth far less again.\n\nIf FIL were to get GFIL to revert the will, it is most likely that he will sell. Unless the inheritence was structured in a way that would prevent him from selling, you have to assume that is what will happen.\n\nIf that were the way this ends up going, there is no reason for your husband to stay with the business. He'd be unlikely to end up with a payout during the sale. Not if dad is sole owner.\n\nAfter the sale, he'd just be another employee... for however long the new owners wanted to keep him around. Which could be a long while. Or it could be as quickly as they could see the back of him. Even if new ownership wanted to keep him around long term, he'd never be more than a valued employee.\n\nAltogether, finding another job with better long term prospects and leaving, and sooner rather than later, would be a reasonable option. Which leads back to my original point.\n\nYou said your husband turned around the business. If he left now, would FIL be able to sustain the turnaround? Or would it start declining again?\n\nThe latter sounds likely. A decline would reduce FILs payout. Which is what he really wants... a payout.\n\nThere are multiple options that would give him a payout without selling the business. Including ones that would not require him to be involved in continuing to run the business either.\n\nThey might not be the size of payout he was looking for. But they'd still be payouts Of course, the payout he's looking for could also be served with a side of destroyed relationship with his son.\n\nFIL might not see that part, but it is a potential consequence, and from the sounds of it, a real one too.", "Sounds like your GFIL is a bit of a jerk on this story too. He wants a legacy, which is why the business will get passed down to you, not your FIL, but did it by pushing his own son into a certain mold. Basically your FIL never got to be his own person rather than his father\u2019s son, and now he\u2019s not even going to get the rewards he\u2019s been promised for so long.\n\nI don\u2019t think that makes you and your husband TA, you want to honor your GFILs wishes and also continue the business that your spouse is passionate about, but this is a situation that has probably been brewing since long before you were born, you just lit the fuse now instead of when Big Jim dies.", "Lets be real. It's about money too and Big Jim son should have a part of it. Big Jim could give him shares and let your husband in command. Imagine you get nothing from your parent because one of the grand daughter has a passion for keeping the estate just as it is.", "If, so, it was pretty well played by the OP.", "And thats fair too. That is my MIL's main argument. That he gave up his whole life to work for his dad and doesn't even get to do what he wants with the business. But to that I say, he could've worked literally anywhere else if he wanted to. I understand *feeling* obligated to do something because of family guilt, but no one forced him at gunpoint for 40 years. He chose to stay there. My husband has 2 brothers who have completely different jobs, he was the only one who chose to work for the shop. No one is being forced into anything here.", "Well so I don't give a shit about the company lol. Thats an exaggeration and I don't NOT give a shit about my husband's career, but I have my own career and focus. I wasn't even a part of the conversation in question, my husband told me about it after the fact. So I have no hand in who does or doesn't get this company, I'm just married to one of the main players in this story.\n\nHe's definitely not getting NOTHING, see my edit to the original post, but he isn't getting the business.", "Ruining a family for money. How fun", "If that's all you're getting from this then I pity your reading comprehension.\n\nI wasn't involved in the inheritance conversation in any way, I was always under the assumption it would just go to my in-laws, they would sell, and that would suck for my husband.  He called me on his way home one night and told me all of this after the fact. So there's no revenge to be had, I had nothing to do with my husband's family dealings. If I wanted revenge on my in-laws there's much more and much worse that I could've done, but who has time for childish shit like that? I don't even talk to my in-laws anymore because it's never enjoyable lmao"]}
