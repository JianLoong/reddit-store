He's a mechanic who started out in the parts room not knowing a thing about the trucks and has now worked his way up to being the service foreman. In the last 3 years he's managed to turn the business around from barely staying afloat off of their regular customers to needing to hire more mechanics with all the new clients they've brought in. He even taught himself how to run reports, process inventory, and handle the business and numbers aspect as well. He's extremely passionate about what he does, he puts at least 60 hours in every week, and he looks forward to owning the company one day and passing it down to our children.\n\nHis father (Jimmy), the current general manager and son of Big Jim, does not share this passion. To him it has always been just a job that he'll inherit from his dad when he passes away and inevitably sell. He has no knowledge of how to actually service the vehicles so all he runs currently are the business ends of things (phone calls, service write ups, scheduling, etc.) and for about 4 months out of the year he travels so my husband runs it solo while he isnt there. \n\nMy husband's parents have talked extensively about how they can't wait to sell the business the minute Big Jim passes so that they can take the money and move to a big house down south, thus ridding themselves of the burden of running the shop but also robbing my husband of one day inheriting the business that he worked so hard to improve.\n\nA few months ago when Big Jim came up to visit, my husband sat him down to break this news to him. His grandpa was devastated to hear that his own son doesn't want to keep the company he started in the family to pass on for generations. My husband suggested putting our names into the will so that it skips his dad and goes directly to him instead to keep it alive and in the family he loves so dearly. And his grandpa did just that.\n\nA few days ago my husband's parents found out about this and they are LIVID. They said that we are greedy for what is theirs by birthright and that Jimmy had been working there for forty years as opposed to my husband's less than 10 years. Apparantly we had no business going above them because they didn't like what they were going to do with the shop and that it's none of our business. It had always been set aside for them in the will and they're saying we should be disgusted with ourselves for ruining their retirement.\n\nSo my husband wants to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680022486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124v2t5/aita_for_asking_my_grandfather_to_hand_the_family/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They just feel entitled to owning it because of seniority and the underlining expectation that they would always receive it once he passed.", "NTA. I'm sure your husband's grandpa would be more than happy to keep the business in the family, than watch it be sold. As a GM his dad isn't doing much anyway other than making sure the building is up to code and there aren't any serious issues. \n\nHowever, it sounds like your step mother also vastly overestimates her worth as it's not even HER birthright. The grandfather is still alive, and has a right to change his will to whatever he wants to keep his best interest in mind.", "NTA all your husband did was give his grandfather all the pertinent information. It\u2019s his business that he built and it\u2019s his choice who it goes to. Your in-laws are wrong in thinking they have a birthright to things your grandfather worked for. Selling a business is not a retirement fund. SS and pension is what working gets you. Not an inheritance.", "NTA. Your husband is greedy for wanting to improve on the family business, but they are not for wanting to make a quick bank from it?", "NTA. Business is still Grandpa\u2019s to do with as he sees fit. \nYour in-laws obviously didn\u2019t save for past 40 years assuming the business would be their golden payoff. Oh well. \n\nCongrats on the business!", "NTA. \n\nIt's the grandfather's shop. He can do what he wants with it.", "NTA, as the current solution keeps the business in the family and continue fulfilling the grandfathers will much better, but ...  His parents do have a point, that they worked the company expecting a payout. Your husband may have to \"buy\" his father out of the company by ensuring some form of compensation and speedy exit and do so ASAP or there may be trouble. Disgruntled employees are a liability.", "NTA. Grandfather deserved to know what was going to happen to the company he worked so hard to create, and he deserves to know that it's going to be in loving hands. If there are no other assets that he could leave to your FIL, that's too bad.  I'm sure there will always be a place for your FIL at the company if he cannot afford to retire.", "NTA. It's Big Jims decision. You didn't lie or exaggerate anything to make yourselves look better. You simply told Big Jim something he absolutely would have wanted to know.", "NTA - Whether anybody likes it or not, this is purely your grandfather's decision, and it sounds like he was appreciative to learn of his son's intentions since they do not align with your grandfather's vision.", "What did Big Jim say when your husband approached him with the idea?", "NTA:  Grandpa is still alive and can change his will at any time.  The AH here are his son and wife (your inlaws) who basically lied by omission about their plans to sell the business and ghoulishly anticipating the death of a relative to have his assets.  Given how morally bankrupt they seem in this story they aren't entitled to grandpas money and frankly don't really seem like they deserve it.", "NTA. At the end of the day, it\u2019s the Grandpa\u2019s decision. You gave him all the information to make an informed decision of what will happen to the business he created. That was a fair, honest and kind thing to do. \nBest wishes to the Grandpa, he sounds like a good, hardworking and passionate person.", "NTA\n\nIt's the grandfather's business to know what the intentions are of whoever he's passing on the business to if he cared about such information (and he clearly did). Jimmy took the inheritance for granted and that's already AH behaviour.\n\nIf your husband intends to keep the business going and supporting everyone's livelihoods over his dad and mom's early retirement plans, good on him.", "NTA. Heads up: the better you make the business, the more valuable it will be. I think that you husband's parents don't know how businesses are valued. It is 3 times cash flow: profit, salary and benefits to the owner. If they use company money to fund the four months of travel, most buyers won't compensate them for that. What I'm saying is that if those costs are buried in the P&L and then the tax return, buyers won't let you \"steal it twice\".\n\nEverybody needs to go to a lawyer and a financial planner. If dad wanted to cash out, he should have worked harder on making the business successful. He did get a paycheck for 40 years. To me that seems like a great thing. Why couldn't 40 years of savings fund a retirement? Maybe travel for 2 months instead of 4?  Again - he could have made the business more successful.", "NTA. Grandfather\u2019s shop, grandfather\u2019s decision. Big Jim clearly sees that his grandson has a passion and knack for running the business, and knows that it will be in good hands after he passes. He ultimately wants to have it go to someone who values the business as more than just a monetary asset, and the grandson clearly does. The fact that Jimmy has been working there for longer than his son and believes that it should go to him is inconsequential. Big Jim owns the business, so he can leave it to whoever he wants.", "INFO why didn\u2019t you guys try to have a family conversation about this with the parents and grandparent involved? Otherwise, it does read like you went behind their backs to cut them out.", "NTA. No one has a company as a birth right.", "NTA\n\nHe can ask. Help him develop some factual talking points, lots of numbers showing how he directly grew the business. But he should include his passion for the business as well. \n\nGood luck.", "INFO, because this is not the full story.\n\n**At the end of the day your grandfather can do whatever he wants with his business that he spent his life building.**\n\n\nBUT it sounds like your husband got to speak on behalf of his father to his grandfather, rather than bringing him into a conversation with the three of them where all the parties can speak for themselves. He also was the one to suggest being put in the will instead over his father, when he stands to hugely gain financially from that decision. Especially depending on how old the grandfather is, advocating to receive a larger inheritance than other parties, without talking or involving the other parties, by essentially bad mouthing them, is pretty not great.\n\nI'd feel manipulated and weirded out as well. **Why didn't your husband ask his father, the general manager and at that moment inheritor of the business, to be part of the conversation with his grandfather about what would happen to the business and what the grandfather wanted?** The inheritance of the family business will be the biggest financial decision happening to your entire family. \n\nI imagine your husband's father telling his story to reddit, of how he has worked dutifully for his father for 4 decades, at a job he doesn't really like but is proud of the business he built with his father. It has been his whole working life. He is second in command, the general manager, and has brought his son into the business, helped teach him how it works, promoted him again and again, worked in lockstep with your grandfather for years to get him up to speed and primed for success as you wind down towards retirement.\n\nThen he finds out one day that the windfall that he admittedly irresponsibly planned for is gone, without a chance to defend himself, because his son had a conversation with his father about how he hates the business and would sell and ruin it the moment he died, insinuated that the only way to carry on his legacy was to give it to him instead. His elderly father believed this wholesale and signed it over without talking to him first, which has set up a legal battle for years once he dies because his son didn't even involve him and voice his concerns or ask if he could buy it out or work with him, before speaking to his grandfather.", "NAH. \n\nThese situations are always difficult and I don't feel like there's a right answer. It's simply up to your grandfather to choose. The reason why I chose NAH is because I think it's understandable to want to keep a family business in the family. Your husband has worked hard and helped turn the place around and there's nothing wrong with worrying about your guys' future. On the other hand, I don't think your in laws are wrong either. Your father in-law has worked there for 40 years expecting to get the business and sell it to retire. It's possible he gave up other career options or prospects to help his father run the business. He likely resents the business to a certain degree.", "INFO: why can\u2019t you buy the business from your FIL? Have a succession plan in place and rather than getting a loan from the bank make payments to the father directly. That way the father gets credit for his 40 years and his expected buyout and your husband still gets to by owner of the business he is passionate about. It seems the most fair since your father in law has put in a lot of years and I can understand it upsetting him that he is being skipped over in the will.", "YTA.  Your FIL has worked there for 40 years and had his retirement planned out based on what his father and employer had promised and your husband essentially completely cut him off at the knees.  No retirement, nothing but food stamps and social security after 40 years.  Your husband could have bought out his parents, his grandfather could have willed the company to both of them.  Lots of options here that don't leave his parents in the cold for the rest of their lives.", "Yeah you are the asshole.  It goes from father to children or child and then to their child.

Your husband, not for telling his grandfather, but he could have suggested several things, give each a percentage so his father could not outright sell it with the requirement for them to accept a reasonable buyout of his percent by your husband.  It could have only been 10% or something.  Depending on where you live, if grandpa wrote his son out of his will entirely, that alone may give his son the legal option to challenge the will.  Grandpa definitely deserved to know, but his son worked there for 40 years and it was known that his only retirement was when he inherited the company.    Granted the value of the company has increased and your husband deserves a reward for that effort.", "Business belongs to grandfather, father and son are employees they work there and get a salary I assume. Grandfather is within his right to do as he pleases with his business, sell it, close it, pass it down as inheritance, whatever he wants. Father should have saved up and planed his retirement with his salary instead of sitting and waiting for grandfather's inheritance, he shouldn't have been planning his retirement with money that wasn't his.

And while he is at the job it sounds like he doesn\u2019t do much\n\nThere\u2019s no way he\u2019ll ever see it that way, but in my eyes your husband did nothing wrong.

Your grandfather clearly wants to keep the business in the family and your husband has a passion for this, so why should the continue it if he wants to and grandfather agrees. I think  he did the right thing, as I find it disgusting that your husband\u2019s dad seems to can\u2019t wait for his dad to die, so he can sell and take the money and run. AND I think your FIL KNEW his dad would NOT want it sold and that is why he never said anything.\n\nEdit to say, your husband should probably watch his back now, In case his dad tries to destroy the business out of spite.", "NTA. No one is owed inheritance. Whatever Big Jim decides to do is his right. The rest of the details are really irrelevant. It's his business and he can do whatever he wants.

So the time will come and it will likely be in a few years or so, so I'm sure it'll get messier in our near future.", "Well at first he was just kind of taken aback by the fact that Jimmy would even sell it. That he had to work through for a minute. But then he said he thought it was a terrific idea and that he was brought of his grandson for all the work he out into the shop to make it what it is today. So as far as we can tell he's pretty pleased with this decision.", "This is super important.\n\nThe business is worth more thanks to grandson.

Jimmy had his chance to explain himself to his father then, or still has it now or later. Assuming he did, Big Jim still went with his decision.", "This is the best verdict here. \n\nI am taking OPs word that the grandad is in sound mental and physical health to have made the decision on top of that. I do think this should have been a discussion between the three of them and with legal advice though.", "While I do understand this, the father did admit to this. Her husband isn\u2019t making up accusations, his father does want to sell it. If the grandfather wants it to stay in the family (which he clearly does) her husband is the one who is going to do that.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t sound like the father is all that proud of the business. He doesn\u2019t know much beyond the surface level (going by the information given). Her husband however, knows everything, and adores this business.\n\nIt\u2019s also thanks to her husband that the business is worth so much.", "And wanting to retire at 60 something is hardly unreasonable. If you don't want to work until the day you die at 90+ then I think it's really ideal not to.", "Since everyone in this story is still alive, the dad can still talk to Big Jim and if Big Jim is convinced if his substitute, can change the will again.", "That's fair. He definitely does resent it in my opinion. My thing is, how can you feel entitled to your father passing his business down to you but then fuck your OWN son out of the shop because you don't like working there or have a passion for mechanics? Idk man. It's rough right now lmao", "Meh, it was up to the grandfather to do what he wanted with the business.  \nI'm sure the dad didn't make such a terrible salary that he couldn't and shouldn't be investing in IRAs etc.\n\nEdit- but yes I agree the grandson should probably assume a business loan to buy Jimmy out. Leaving Jimmy out in the cold certainly doesn't seem like the familial thing to do.\n\nEdit 2: and being able to run the business whether or not you enjoy working on trucks or know how kind of seems beyond the point.", "Please keep it in the family and don\u2019t let your dad get it to sell.. your not the ass but your parents are.", "Forgot to add accountant. Make sure the lawyers do business sales and trust stuff. These people have tons of solutions. A lot can be done to minimize taxes.\n I\u2019m going to say it again: if the business was just breaking even when hubby started, it was worthless. If there is profit it is worth something now. The equipment is not part of the price. If they own the building and underpay rent, that will take the value down.

His job title? None of my project manager, CEO, and angel investors can build our software applications, but they are great at their roles at a company that builds software applications. She is basically saying \"he does his job\" but making it sound like that is a bad thing.\n\nCombined with the comments they made about the husband's family (gold digging wife who hasn't worked a day in her life) I sense a long and ugly battle ahead.", "I can't speak for him but it's likely because he was likely told from the beginning that if he worked there that he would get it and never planned on giving it to his son from the beginning. In his mind inheriting the shop and then selling was always his way out regardless if his son started working there or not. It's very likely he feels that your husband is young enough to get another job and still be successful or even stay at the shop and continue working. I think it's a shortsighted approach and while I don't necessarily agree with it, I can understand his point of view.", "I agree.  I think the kind thing to do in the situation would be to offer your FIL an early out whenever he wants it and profit sharing from the company. \n\nIt's rough but they REALLY counted their chickens before they hatched and talked.  If they had kept their mouths shut it would have all went down according to their plan. \n\nI do also wonder how long they had had this plan for? Before your husband started working there? Did he know about it then or is it recent?", "Yes he wouldn't pass down the business but surely the wealth from the sale would be inherited eventually.", "I understand this, but in a sub like this if we speculate we\u2019ll be here forever. While his 4 decades of work certainly are in his favor, it has been stated that he only did them on the understanding that when his father died he get a payout - by going against his fathers wishes. He doesn\u2019t care much about this business, but his son does. That is what the grandfather wants.\n\nThough you are right, I read it again, he is on a different side of the business than his son. The way it is, that particular lack of knowledge isn\u2019t a bad thing. However, it does sound like her husband can do both sides.", "Bold of you to assume the money won't be spent before he can inherit.", "That\u2019s not guaranteed by any stretch. Depending on how Jimmy decides to spend his retirement, he could easily blow through all of the money before any of it reaches his son. According to OP\u2019s comments, Jimmy already spends months of the year on vacation, lives in a multimillion dollar house, and has a wife who has expensive tastes. That seems to indicate that he probably wouldn\u2019t be afraid to spend all of the money on himself and leave nothing for his son to inherit."]}
