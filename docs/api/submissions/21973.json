It\u2019s effectively putting your friend in the same position that your brother is in. \n\nIf your dad is so precious about putting family above all else, why doesn\u2019t he offer your brother a room?", "NTA.\n\nYour dad is wrong. You are not shutting out family in need; you are providing several more-than-reasonable options to your brother to accommodate him. If his only acceptable solution is to kick out your flat mate so he can move in, or become homeless, then that\u2019s on him. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.", "NTA. Let's get this straight. He wants you to kick out your flatmate *who's paying rent* so that he can move in for free.\n\nHow can this possibly be justified beyond \"because I want what he has\"? I'm half surprised he hasn't asked you to move out, too, so that he can have the apartment to himself.\n\nYou've given him some amazingly generous alternatives, which he's rejected. You've done what you can.

You've provided your brother with plenty of offers to help, and you're certainly not obligated to kick out your flatmate.", "NTA - You are not shutting out family in need! You are just not willing (or possibly able) to kick another person out of your apartment just to make your brother more comfy. \n\nI also feel like I am missing something here - I understand that your brother cannot afford his previous place on his own, but how has that translated into him not being able to pay rent anywhere on his own? How did this even get to the point where you kicking out your flat mate and moving your brother is was his best option?", "NTA. Keep your flatmate otherwise then he's homeless \n\nReduce the offer to he can sleep on the couch or a mattress on the floor. He's not in a position to make VIP demands. I hope he's working. I hope he'd be responsible if he does come to stay. It needs to have a time limit on it and he needs to help clean and pay bills  \u2014 for his own dignity as much as respect for his younger sister and her flatmate \n\nTell your dad to find your brother accommodation himself . It's not your responsibility  Don't be their slave or doormat. If\n your brother chooses homelessness over a free couch, that's his choice, his decision, not your responsibility. Don't let them guilt trip you", "NTA - You provided reasonable solutions to him, while still respecting your flatmate and honoring your agreement with them as well.  Beggers cant be choosers as they say.", "NTA\n\nYou can't just kick your roommate out!  They've been paying rent, they may be on the lease, they're certainly not obligated to go through all of the expense and inconvenience of moving for the sake of your brother.\n\nHeck, you're going too far just telling your roommate that your brother may be moving in.  It is your roommate's place as much as yours, they may not be comfortable having a strange man living in their living room.  You need to ***ask***, not tell, and be prepared to accept \"no\" as an answer without arguments or guilting them.\n\nYour roommate also has the right to insist that your brother contribute to the rent and utilities if he's going to be living there.  He's using space, so they can't use it.  And utilities will go up, with more spent on water and electricity, etc.  This needs to be negotiated fairly. If you tell your brother he doesn't have to pay rent, you're forcing the roommate to subsidize his housing.\n\nDo not promise anything to your brother, your father, or anyone else regarding your brother living there until you have thoroughly discussed this with your roommate, obtained their permission, and negotiated how costs will be divided with a third person living there.", "NTA!! Your roommate is basically on your lease as well, which them leaving would be breaking said lease on their part. You aren't responsible for your older brother and where he lives.", "Honestly ESH EXCEPT your roommate.\n\nObviously you can't unilaterally force your roommate out even if you wanted to. They have a right to live there.\n\nI am shocked that your roommate would actually agree to have your brother crash in the living room for an indefinite amount of time. Maybe for a week in a crisis but any longer is really pushing it.\n\nAnd even though you say that no one uses the living room, I think you are understating it. You have to pass through the living room probably to access the kitchen and the bathrooms?\n\nDo each of you have your own private ensuite because you are asking someone - not sure of gender - to share a bathroom.\n\nAnd YOU have made a decision that your brother will pay nothing. At the very least you have added a roommate and the expenses should be split in some manner. \n\nYour parents are arses as well for attempting to force you to take in your brother and evict your roommate. Why don't they take your brother in to crash on THEIR sofa.", "NTA I would withdraw your offer for your brother to stay in the lounge. His demand for you to throw your roommate out is incredibly selfish. Your brother would almost certainly be a selfish and lazy houseguest and you will have trouble getting rid of him. \n\nHow does your roommate really feel about your brother potentially staying in the lounge? Did you give them an option to express their thoughts or did you just tell them it was happening? That\u2019s hardly fair. \n\nIf your brother does stay with you will you give him a definite time frame? Out by a certain date? Why does he get to take up space and increase utility cost but not pay anything? Will you pay extra utilities to cover or do you expect your roommate to cover this cost too? \n\nWhat is the bathroom situation? Are there 1 or 2 bathrooms? Will your roommate be expected to share a bathroom with your selfish demanding brother?\n\nI\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s a bit ESH (except current roommate).", "If your Dad thinks you are unfair why isn't he telling his son he would be happy for him to stay with Dear old Dad?\n\nnta \n\nBUT DAD AND BROTHER ARE!", "NTA, you said he can stay with you but he chooses not to unless u kick someone else out. He\u2019s the AH. Tell your father to let him live him.", "NTA. The offers you proposed were practical and generous. And if he really is at risk of homelessness, he is in no position to be particular.", "Yeah, he's being a choosing beggar.", "If the alcoholic ex was also abusive then I could see this being a situation of the brother essentially self sabotaging his attempt to leave", "Not only taht, but once you acquiesce once, it'll be an expectation going forward.  \n\nWent through this with my MIL, which she said only for a year but ended up being 5 years (yeah, be prepared for that, too u/celebro123 ).  We paid for new TV apps, couldn't be bothered to change hte kids diapers when she agreed to babysit a couple a days a week while we worked, ended up paying for a lot of her shit even though she had disability checks monthly, etc. etc. etc."]}
