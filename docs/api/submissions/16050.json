There might be history or maybe not.\n\nDid he apologize sincerely though?

You would expect a 21 year old to be more emotionally mature than a 15 year old, but clearly this isn\u2019t the case here. He misses you. He wanted to spend time with you. You blew him off and that really hurt him. He should not have said what he said, but you should have expressed that to him instead of using it to repeatedly hurt him months after the incident. This is borderline emotional abuse and you need to realize how deeply you\u2019re hurting your family.", "No, it isn't, actually. Letting a person know you've forgiven them, maybe.

If you only said it to him the one time before spring break, I would say you weren't the asshole and just returning the favor, because at 15, one is old enough to be able to have it dished back to them after starting it.

Your bro said something really offensive and hurtful that he probably didn't mean, and you got back at him.

The truth is that I was hurt when you said it because I see you as my real brother, and it made me sad to think that you might not see me the same way. It was wrong for me to throw it back at you, though, and I should have talked to you after you first made the comment. Was there any truth to those words? Or was it something you said only in anger? If you didn\u2019t mean it, I\u2019d really appreciate it if we didn\u2019t use that aspect of our relationship in arguments anymore. We can be mad and we can tell the other that we suck or whatever, but we will always be brothers, and I hope that that can stay separate from whatever disagreements we might have. I\u2019ll also try to do better with talking to you directly if there\u2019s anything that upsets me in the future rather than letting is spiral into something worse, and I hope you feel comfortable enough to do the same with me.

I had a similar situation happen to me a week ago. Granted I am just a sister in law, but according to the youngest bil (teenager) I'm just his brother's wife and the children we have are just my kids. \n\nHe only apologized because MIL told him too, so I'm still a little bitter but I am also three weeks postpartum \ud83d\ude05 I haven't lashed out at him or anything, but I've made it clear to my husband and mil that if he doesn't consider me family, then I will not go out of my way for him. \n\nSo, he was getting an awesome crate bimonthly -- I stopped it. Why get him something that he actually likes when I'm not family?

The 15yo for making that comment in the first place should've controlled his anger better, so he is the AH.

Tell him how you really feel about him and ask him why he said what he said.\n\nHopefully the two of you can apologize to each other for the pain you both have caused, and start to take steps to repair your relationship.\n\nA few sessions with a counselor for each of you to learn some better communication techniques might help.\n\nIf you want to shatter what is left of your relationship with your brother and grind the shards into the ground under your heel, just continue on as you have been.", "ESH.  You guys are brothers and siblings can be mean to each other.  However, you're both too old now to be saying stupid hurtful things like that to each other.   Grow up and talk it out like the adult and almost adult you supposedly are.", "ESH.\n\nJust go apologize and try to just fucking talk about it. You obviously both feel the same hurt. Be a role model and address why his original comment hurt you, then given him the floor to do the same thing.", "Probably an unpopular opinion but YTA i once said something really mean to my brother as well when I was a kid and i cannot tell you how much i regretted saying it i did not say it to his face, so I never apologized for it but i am about 90% sure he had heard me, that is honestly one of the biggest regrets of my life and i still feel extremely bad about it but my brother never once brought it up and i can not be more grateful for that. so i think you should also maybe try to let it go, if you think he is genuinely sorry about it", "ESH, yall need a serious heart to heart and not just a simple \"sorry\". Talk to him about how it hurt and how he can't use that to try and manipulate you into helping him (like the driving thing, he can't be all \"oh if you were my real brother you would do x, y, z\") and how that's not ok to do to people (like he can't tell a partner \"if you love me, you'll let me do butt stuff\"). And yeah apologize for doing it back (not that it hurt your feelings, but that you did it back). But for real, an honest sit down and heart to heart so he can understand why what he did hurt your feelings.", "NTA. You are mildly the AH for repeating the hurtful joke, but then you apologized. People make mistakes, and help be a big brother by persevering and helping your little brother learn the important skill of accepting an apology and repairing relationships. When things calm down, go back again with a \u201chey brother, I love you. I am sorry. I want to make this right. Please accept my apology.\u201d", "YTA. You're holding a grudge against a child. A child. A. Child. Think about that.", "What makes you an ah is you weaponised his words to purposely hurt him he said it once you did can\u2019t let it go\n\nQuestion what made him say it in the first place.? Your both so young even tho 21 is an adult you both still young \n\nSit down with each other talk it out as brothers/sibling friends whatever your relationship leads to", "YTA. I don\u2019t get why people aren\u2019t mentioning the huuuge difference in the context of how each brother used it. If the younger brother had said those words exactly its just an awkward way of him expressing his own insecurities and not an actual attempt at distancing himself. Of course both OP and their brother are both young but for the younger brother who still lives in the same house it would feel more like a loss for him as opposed to OP who is out having lots of new experiences in college. So while OP is trying to catch up with friends and do a bunch of different things during break the brother is probably going to be waiting for the date OP gets home and then disappointed when he doesn\u2019t spend as much time there as he had imagined.\n\nIts completely reasonable for OP to want to come home and catch up with friends and relax and whatnot, but I had a similar situation when I was in college bc my half sister was really sad I wasn\u2019t spending time at home/willing to take her out places. I don\u2019t really think it was just the driving lesson that made the brother say that but it seems so much more rooted in his insecurity that his brother doesn\u2019t want to do things with him so his brain jumped to \u201cit\u2019s bc I\u2019m not his real brother\u201d. This could have been a really great opportunity to reassure him and tell him that of course you are his brother and communicate why you can\u2019t drive with him, make another plan and express that it hurts that he would say that to you. \nInstead you chose to respond to that by going out of your way to throw his fear/insecurity that you don\u2019t want to do things with him bc he \u201cisn\u2019t your real brother\u201d into his face. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the best way for the younger brother to go about it but it\u2019s also super common for people to say their insecurity out loud to another person in hopes that they\u2019ll reassure them & deny it\u2019s truth. Like the trope of women telling a partner they look fat in a dress.. they don\u2019t want you to say that they do and should have never put the thing on. Of course I wasn\u2019t there but it seems like he just wanted to feel important to you and you chose to hold a grudge and be mean over a comment that reads way more like, \u201cof course you wouldnt want to make time for me because you don\u2019t see me as your real brother so I\u2019m not a priority\u201d than an attempt to say he doesn\u2019t think of you as his brother and is attempting to make you feel bad bc he didn\u2019t get his way right then.", "We need a new voting category \u2026 something about \u201cThis post is about 15yr olds being 15\u201d\u2026. \u201cPG12\u201d sounds about right.   \n\n\nto the OP\u2026 YTA.

He was very little at the time, so he's always been my brother, practically. Anyway, I don't think new drivers should be driving in adverse conditions, personally, and I think he should learn from someone more experienced than me, like our dad.\n\nYeah,  I was confused as well until I saw that OP had commented this.  Sounds like there is more to this story.", ">The kid was probably **devastated** when his brother went off to college was probably spent **weeks if not months looking forward to a driving lesson** with his big brother, who then came home and **seemingly wanted nothing to do with him**. He probably has a lot of **internalized feelings about his brother leaving him** and **not wanting to spend time with him** and in that moment **his heart was broken** and he lashed out in anger.\n\nOh my God, this is all just so dramatic. Assumption after assumption after assumption. \n\nI didn't realise not wanting to take someone out driving qualifies as 'not wanting anything to do with them'. It's just as likely that OP was happy to spend time with his bro over Christmas, but just didn't want to drive with him.", "None of which excuses or makes acceptable basically pushing OP from the family by saying they aren't really related.\n\nThat's emotional manipulation and its not on.", "He wasn't just a jerk to be a jerk, he was a jerk because his brother never actually apologized for being incredibly hurtful and rejecting their entire relationship over a petty squabble. \n\nThat's why it's ESH, because while OP was being a jerk, the brother was incredibly hurtful first and took no responsibility for it.", "But not his REAL devil...", "no?? im 15 and a freshman and most of the other freshmen at my school are also 15 by now? you start  9th grade at 14 and turn 15 while in 9th grade most of the time idk what ur talking abt", "Probably because it's not until OP brought it up *again* that the brother finally apologized. It's no wonder that OP's been bringing it up when it's never actually been resolved.", "Holding on to grudges waiting for someone who\u2019s wronged you to come ask for your forgiveness is not a recipe for happiness.", "No one's saying the 15 yo is in 8th grade tho", "Not forgiving someone isn't the same as holding on to grudges. You can move on with life and never give a person another thought without forgiving them.", "If someone can say something that hurtful to you and doesn't think of it until they need something from you it's not holding a grudge. It's creating distance from someone who was using you with little care about your feelings.", "We live in the digital age. Little brother any time they thought about it and felt bad could have called or sent an E-mail or dropped a text saying what ever they needed to say. They didn't over that 4 months period. They apologized only after they were told by the new definition of family they gave OP, OP didn't feel inclined to help them and now that there were consequences gave a half assed apology without noting what they were truly apologizing for.", "> I don't think new drivers should be driving in adverse conditions\n\nWhy? That's how I learned and I'm better off for it. If you learn in the harder conditions, the easy conditions when you take your test will be a breeze. My friend's parents didn't let her learn in adverse conditions. She got her license eight months later than she should've because she didn't get enough experience to pass her test the first time around.\n\n> I think he should learn from someone more experienced than me\n\nThen communicate that to him?", "Somewhat debatable, hormones can lead to a lot of lashing out and saying hurtful things. \n\nThat being said, that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to teach teenagers to take account for those moments and apologising/explain themselves afterwards and/or teach them methods to help them calm down in the heat of the moment before they say something they\u2019ll regret.", "Oh, come off it", "No a therapist is there primarily for the benefit of the patient. If you apply that here then OP is the asshole for not just focusing on how to fix his patient which means you don't give a damn about his feeling he just needs to go to his therapist to unpack. \n\nThese are two equals having a fight.", "So we\u2019re allowing undeveloped and unqualified people to vote, buy alcohol and cigarettes and own guns?  /s", "I agree there\u2019s a difference between letting go of a grudge and repairing a relationship. In this case OP is clearly nursing a grudge.", "Nah, man. This is a 15 year old kid and a 21 year old young adult. The proper response was to either explain to him that it was hurtful when it happened or else to realize that 15 year olds say stupid things they don\u2019t mean and let it go.\n\nStewing about it for a couple months was not the move.", "15 year olds know the impact of their words. It's why they are so good at hurt people unlike a 10 year old who's just throwing crap at the wall they know what is going to hurt. They also are old enough to hopefully have empathy and a conscience over the impact of what they said. This one didn't. He cut the familial relationship. He needs to do the rebuilding and not just when he needs something.\n\nThat is the lesson here.", "I think the fact that he is adopted and you aren\u2019t changes things, especially if his dad isn\u2019t in the picture, as he could be left out or feeling a certain way about the family dynamics. I can see why that wouldn\u2019t occur to you, because family is family and I\u2019m sure youve always thought of him as just your brother, but from the outside looking in it makes you seem insensitive."]}
