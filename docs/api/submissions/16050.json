I think you should apologize to him and stop saying that.", "YTA\n\nYou're supposed to be the adult in the relationship at the least. Stop acting like a moody teenager. He was an asshole, but you're perpetuating it instead of stopping the cycle.", "YTA - practice grace and show your younger brother how to behave in a mature way.

You are older and should be able to keep your emotions under control better than a 15yr old who had a moment of anger. He acted like an immature 15 yr old with his comment. You on the other hand, acted like a 15yr old holding a grudge and repeating the comment at times you had more control over yourself just to be petty. But you aren't a 15yr old.

The first time I can kinda understand, even though being this petty towards a 15-year-old is at least odd, but the second one was too much. Being 15 isn\u2019t a free pass to say whatever you want with no consequences, but you could try to be a little bit more understanding towards him since you\u2019re older.

He got hurt but instead of communcating it, he decided it was best to hurt his brother multiple times as well. That immaturity could be seen from a 15 years old but shouldnt be expected from an adult. That is not how communcation works and OP is showing a good example of bad communication.  The brother is of course to blame as well, But OP isnt better. ESH", "I am telling the whole story. That's what happened. He was upset. He said the thing. The thing bothered me.

My dad was his stepdad, but he adopted him. My stepmom didn't adopt me. So we have the same dad now, but my mom is still my mom, and my stepmom is his mom. It sounds complicated, but really he's just my brother and was being a dick that day, and I was a dick back because he hurt my feelings.", "But you arent a teenager anymore. You shouldve told him it hurts your feelings instead of going down on his level. Your (not) Brother or whatever was in the wrong and immature, but you wouldnt expect an adult to respond with immaturity as well. You were both in the wrong and need another conversation about it, but the whole Situation shouldnt have become so big and you shouldve told him the first time it hurts you instead of trying to hurt him as well multiple times.\n\nESH"]}
