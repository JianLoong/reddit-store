He got hurt but instead of communcating it, he decided it was best to hurt his brother multiple times as well.

The brother is of course to blame as well, But OP isnt better. ESH", "I am telling the whole story. That's what happened. He was upset. He said the thing. The thing bothered me.

You shouldve told him it hurts your feelings instead of going down on his level. Your (not) Brother or whatever was in the wrong and immature, but you wouldnt expect an adult to respond with immaturity as well.

Who, incidentally, should be the actual person taking bro out for driving lessons.", "YTA\n\nIn theory, this is E-S-H because you both said the same mean phrase, right? But in reality, you were deliberately cruel vs. his angry outburst.\n\nFirst of all, you're 21, use your words. This never should've made it past December. Your brother could've learned a real lesson in December, \"saying cruel things when angry isn't okay, and you should apologize for what you say instead of just moving on and ignoring it.\"\n\nInstead, you waited like 3 months for a tender family moment where your brother was expressing disappointment at not seeing you to drop that phrase like a gotcha moment. Not only was that petty, but it was objectively cruel, and nowhere near the same circumstances.\n\nYou then did it again, in closer circumstance. Now you're surprised your brother doesn't wanna interact with you? You turned a potential life lesson into showing your brother you are a petty AH who holds massive grudges. Now, you owe him an apology, and please just tell him your feelings. Maybe you'll get a real apology when you do.", "ESH but you more than him. A teenager made an inflammatory teenage comment and you\u2019re the one holding it over his head and poking the wound instead of saying how it was actually hurtful and not cool", "Did the 15 year old, who is old enough to know when he\u2019s acting like a brat, apologise to you at all for saying you\u2019re not his real brother?

So no free pass just because he is young.  You should have had a talk with him and let him know what he said was uncalled for.  When you want someone to help, you don't resort to mean tactics.  There was no healthy communication between the 2 of you so no wonder nothing was resolved.  There is enough blame to go around.", "Teenagers are unfinished. Literally. Their brains are not done cooking. They say and do a lot of stupid things that are often hurtful. \n\nYou do not have that excuse. \n\nESH But you suck more.", "Congratulations on behaving like a 15 yo.

He should have apologised to you after saying that though but i don't blame him a lot.\n\nOn the other hand, continuously bringing up something a teenager said is just... Immature, let's be honest here mate. You need to stop bringing it up in simple conversations.\n\nHave a mature talk, talk about how it hurt both of you and apologise to each other.", "ESH. \n\nHe was being a little shit, but you\u2019re an adult, act like it, not like a 15 teen little shit.", "Dang YTA consider archeology with that affinity for digging up the past", "ESH but you suck more because you\u2019re older. You\u2019re acting like kids, not adults. The 15 year old gets a bit of a pass because even though what he said was hurtful he may be feeling some stress or insecurity, or he may be a jerk, hard to tell but 15 yo aren\u2019t known for maturity. You decided to handle it not in a mature way but in a passive aggressive\u2019I know you are but what am I?\u2019 childish manner. You suck even more for not letting it go but digging in deeper. Work on your ability to effectively communicate rather than passive aggressive lashing out. It\u2019ll help you in the long run.", "YTA, he is 15, teenagers say such things, I have and I have grown to regret them, still do after decades. The moment he said, you should have told him that it was hurtful. Do you know why he yelled? Because maybe, just maybe, he was already guilty, but being a teenager didn't know how to apologise. Sorry, but teenagers need to be told to say sorry because they still do not want to fight for themselves. Could have handled it like the adult you say you are.", "INFO: OP when your parents found out thru the face-time call did they take any action to condemn the behaviour and did your brother apologise.\n\nIf the answer to all of this negative. Then with zero guilt continue and do share this with the extended family and friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: NTA, after reading OP's other comments", "Soft YTA but your still young not as young as him which is why soft.

If he has not apologized, then NTA, but you could have sat him down and explained how hurt you were by his words.  Actions have consequences, and he needs to learn that lesson now, as opposed to being sheltered from it.", "NTA.  Turnabout is fair play.", "NTA.", "while this technically could be considered E-S-H, i'm actually leaning towards NAH because you both sound kinda silly and immature rather than actual AHs.\n\njust apologise to each other and talk it out.", "I understand how much that hurt. My little brother and I have different dads and if he\u2019d ever said anything like that to me it would have crushed me. I do have experiences like yours though, just with other \u201cfamily\u201d members. My brother and I were raised in a tiny town with my stepdad\u2019s (my brother\u2019s dad) family living in that town too. Those people were always more than willing to remind me that I wasn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d while my brother was, memories of that still hurt to this day, and I haven\u2019t had contact with any of my stepdad\u2019s family in over a decade. So I get how much those words hurt. \n\nMy advice, sit down and and talk to your brother and try to put it behind you. It\u2019s obvious you love him, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have hurt so badly. NTA", "NTA - but it\u2019s immature to retaliate. You should apologize and make amends just be cool with people especially when it\u2019s family. It pays off in so many ways, and you don\u2019t have second guess your actions. Good luck to you and your brother from another mother.", "ESH. But he\u2019s 15 and you are 21. Time to grow up and teach him lessons in a better way. By using your words to explain things. Not be petty. \n\nSee how I\u2019m explaining to you how you were wrong instead of throwing insults? Communication. It\u2019s key.", "Dunno. Does he only approach you when he needs something from you? Does \"brotherhood\" only exist when he's in need of something?\n\nWhen he said you werent his brother, did you just only get hurt? Or was there a switch? There might be history or maybe not.\n\nDid he apologize sincerely though? I want to say you should be the bigger person because you're older and an adult but it would be hypocritical if we only consider his feelings and not yours. \n\nIf you really treat him as a brother, yet you still keep on reminding him this again and again, maybe YTA. \n\nBut if you dont treat him as a brother then maybe stay LC? Until both of you see where your wrongs are, and forgive each other.", "NTA\n\nYour brother hurt you then you hurt him back and then he apologized for hurting you first. Shit should have been done by then him saying fuck you to you was unwarranted.", "Holy shit dude YTA. You would expect a 21 year old to be more emotionally mature than a 15 year old, but clearly this isn\u2019t the case here. He misses you. He wanted to spend time with you. You blew him off and that really hurt him. He should not have said what he said, but you should have expressed that to him instead of using it to repeatedly hurt him months after the incident. This is borderline emotional abuse and you need to realize how deeply you\u2019re hurting your family.", "No, it isn't, actually. Letting a person know you've forgiven them, maybe. Forgiveness is for yourself, to move past the event. You never even have to tell someone they're 'forgiven'. Acceptance of an apology isn't the same thing.", "i dont understand why this was downvoted. it was kind and spot on advice.", "You're like the devil sitting on people's shoulders.", "Forgiveness actually has nothing to do with the person who wronged you and everything to do with yourself.", "Do you seriously think the brother didn't  know his comment was hurtful? It doesn't take a mind reader to know.", "Yea, he said it because he knew it was hurtful. This isn't something personal just randomly coming up in conversation."]}
