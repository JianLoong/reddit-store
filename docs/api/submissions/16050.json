There might be history or maybe not.\n\nDid he apologize sincerely though?

You would expect a 21 year old to be more emotionally mature than a 15 year old, but clearly this isn\u2019t the case here. He misses you. He wanted to spend time with you. You blew him off and that really hurt him. He should not have said what he said, but you should have expressed that to him instead of using it to repeatedly hurt him months after the incident. This is borderline emotional abuse and you need to realize how deeply you\u2019re hurting your family.", "No, it isn't, actually. Letting a person know you've forgiven them, maybe. Forgiveness is for yourself, to move past the event. You never even have to tell someone they're 'forgiven'.

If you only said it to him the one time before spring break, I would say you weren't the asshole and just returning the favor, because at 15, one is old enough to be able to have it dished back to them after starting it.

Your bro said something really offensive and hurtful that he probably didn't mean, and you got back at him. Bringing it up a second time was probably a bit much once you were even and now's a good time to apologize and move on. Make sure you get a real legit apology out of him too. You'll look back on this years later and laugh.", "So, is he really your brother?", "OP, it sounds like you really care about your brother. You\u2019re both clearly hurt, and I think this is a really good opportunity to model some healthy conflict resolution for your brother. \n\nI would recommend talking to your brother one-on-one and being honest and maybe a bit vulnerable. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I keep bringing up those comments about not being your real brother. The truth is that I was hurt when you said it because I see you as my real brother, and it made me sad to think that you might not see me the same way. It was wrong for me to throw it back at you, though, and I should have talked to you after you first made the comment. Was there any truth to those words? Or was it something you said only in anger? If you didn\u2019t mean it, I\u2019d really appreciate it if we didn\u2019t use that aspect of our relationship in arguments anymore. We can be mad and we can tell the other that we suck or whatever, but we will always be brothers, and I hope that that can stay separate from whatever disagreements we might have. I\u2019ll also try to do better with talking to you directly if there\u2019s anything that upsets me in the future rather than letting is spiral into something worse, and I hope you feel comfortable enough to do the same with me. Is there anything you want to tell me about now?\u201d \n\nVery gentle ESH bc you\u2019re both young and managing emotions can be really difficult if you never learned how.

You are not under any obligation to teach your brother right from wrong. Parenting fail on your dads part especially.", "NTA -- Of course, I might be biased though. I had a similar situation happen to me a week ago. Granted I am just a sister in law, but according to the youngest bil (teenager) I'm just his brother's wife and the children we have are just my kids. \n\nHe only apologized because MIL told him too, so I'm still a little bitter but I am also three weeks postpartum \ud83d\ude05 I haven't lashed out at him or anything, but I've made it clear to my husband and mil that if he doesn't consider me family, then I will not go out of my way for him. \n\nSo, he was getting an awesome crate bimonthly -- I stopped it. Why get him something that he actually likes when I'm not family?

The 15yo for making that comment in the first place should've controlled his anger better, so he is the AH.

He probably has a lot of internalized feelings about his brother leaving him and not wanting to spend time with him and in that moment his heart was broken and he lashed out in anger.

If you love someone who messes up you teach them how you want to be treated. You don\u2019t just continue lashing out passive aggressively forever ensuring it is always an open festering wound.

Didn't sound like there was any remorse there.\n\nI also find it ironic that your dad is trying to get you to apologize for having brought up his comment a second time when he never felt any need to ask your stepbrother to apologize after learning about it originally.

I don't say things I don't mean. They do. They can accept the consequences of that.\n\nBetter, less toxic advice, would be to very sincerely talk to your brother about why that hurts you so much. Let him know that you'd like a real apology from him. If he's too prideful or immature to do that at this moment, then you'll wait for him, but until then, you will be putting some boundaries in place and reducing contact so neither of you will make matters worse.

No, it's infuriating.\n\nI've seen people on this sub hold 2 - 3 year olds to higher standards of maturity than teenagers. I will always bring up the story of the 15 year old who literally locked her 3 year old sister in a room for hours because she was annoying, and the teenager didn't want to babysit her anymore. Yes, the teenager was being parentified by her parent, but she literally abused a toddler because she was mad, and I *still*, to this day, have people tell me the toddler deserved it and the teenager didn't do anything wrong.", "Lol because we all know how mature 21 year olds are. As soon as you turn 18, and any time after that, we all gain the power of total maturity and never do anything immature or act out because our feelings were seriously hurt.\n\nI 100% hold 15 year olds and 21 year olds to the same standards in regards to not saying mean shit. If the 15 year old can't handle the fact that someone is lashing out at them because they hurt them with their words, that's the 15 year old's problem because they *certainly* know better by that point.

He adopted him. Now he's just his son.", "This is the best advice!! And to add, I don\u2019t think OP us TA, I think the dad and little brother are.", "What the hell?! How could anyone excuse someone old enough to watch a toddler doing that?! The same people who excuse 15 to 17-year-olds for acting terribly are the same people who bemoan adults who act like they can do whatever they want without consequences. Obviously they're legally minors, but they're much closer to adulthood than childhood when they are around that age. If you're old enough to drop out of school, work a part-time job, and have a driver's license (as you can at 16), you're not exactly a child at that point."]}
