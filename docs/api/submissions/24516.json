So here\u2019s the situation. I (25M) have been with my girlfriend (25F) for about a year now. Things have been good, we have small arguments here and there but we\u2019re pretty good about being respectful and resolving stuff.\n\nWe do not live together, we both live alone in separate apartments. We tend to alternate staying at each other\u2019s places every weekend, so one weekend she will stay with me and the next I\u2019ll stay with her (not like a fixed rule, just what we\u2019ve been doing). Given our arrangement, we tend to not do cleaning or buy groceries for each other\u2019s places, just our own. This weekend I was staying at her place. \n\nEarlier today I decided to jerk off. She was sleeping so I went to the bathroom as not to disturb her. I do the deed, and needed to pee after. Now I know myself and know that peeing with an erection and right after masturbating tends to be messy. I can\u2019t sit to pee because I\u2019m erect, but I angle my body down and get close to the toilet to minimize the damage. However, for whatever reason this was like nothing I\u2019ve ever done before. It went fucking everywhere. There was somehow urine coming out an angle more than perpendicular to my body (like towards and behind me, I genuinely dont understand it). Long story short, a decent amount of urine got on the floor and the cabinet next to the toilet. I obviously felt awful about this and was not going to make her clean it, so I grab the cleaning supplies and begin cleaning the entire bathroom. I didn\u2019t hit anything other than the floor, toilet and cabinet but figured it would be the right thing to clean all of it. \n\nMy girlfriend wakes up in the middle of me cleaning and asks what I\u2019m doing. I explain the situation and apologize. She starts yelling at me and telling me I am disgusting. I again apologize and she tells me \u201cget the fuck out of my apartment\u201d and she doesn\u2019t want to date a toddler. I said it was an accident, and I was doing everything I could to fix the situation and didn\u2019t appreciate being spoken to that way. We argued a bit more and she again told me to leave, so I did. At that point I had not cleaned the entire bathroom but had cleaned the areas I peed on plus the counter/sink. \n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken or texted since then. I honestly don\u2019t even know if we\u2019re still dating. I don\u2019t really think I owe her another apology and am upset at how volatile she made it. None of our arguments have ever been like that before. I understand this is pretty gross and get why she\u2019s pissed, but I\u2019ve already apologized for what I\u2019ve done wrong and tried to make it right, and now feel she owes me one for how cruel she was about it. Am I the Asshole here?\n\nEdit: To add details people are asking about.\n\n\nWhy were you masturbating in your gf\u2019s home?\n\n\nWe have discussed this before. I have a higher sex drive than her and she said she has no issue with me masturbating in her home so long as it isn\u2019t interfering with our sex life. \n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you just have sex with your gf?\n\n\nNot really sure why this matters, but the reason I did not just have sex with her is because she was sleeping and I doubt she would have been super thrilled about being woken up early on a Saturday because I wanted sex.\n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you just pee in the shower?\n\n\nHonestly didn\u2019t think of it and am also not sure if she would have been ok with that.", "created_utc": 1691888563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pl4h3/aita_for_peeing_on_the_floor_of_my_girlfriends/", "score": 293, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Standing will just make it worse.\n\nYou were cleaning up, you didn\u2019t leave a mess. It sounds like she was angry you did the deed alone, and then you peed. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunately a natural occurrence with the limitations of the equipment we have.

Pee on the floor that\u2019s already cleaned up? That\u2019s nothing.", "NTA. You were respectful by taking matters into your own hands, and you cleaned up after yourself. Her reaction was weirdly aggressive for what is essentially an honest mistake that could happen to anyone who needs to pee with an erection.

Your urethra share a function. Cum is sticky. Pee is not. You know when that one little hole in the shower head gets a speck of dust or something invisible and shoots everywhere. Same thing.

Some grown adult women are jealous teenagers when it comes to this and don\u2019t understand that sometimes you <TBH myself included> want to just knock one out real quick and move along with the day.

Uh, surprise.\u201d\n\nThe whole scenario sounds pretty funny to me. I keep wondering if you were even using the hands God  gave you to aim for the the toilet? Or was it free and loose like a lawn sprinkler? I just picture you bent and squatting, arms out like airplane wings,  trying to keep your balance while you peed all over.  \n\nI have to say probably NTA overall", "NTA - you tried to clean.  I only hit that level when I step in pee on the floor that no one has attempted to clean up.  THAT will make my head explode \ud83e\udd2f.  But unless you\u2019re leaving stuff out, you tried.

Of course it's gross to think about pee being everywhere, but after cleaning it's gone so there's absolutely no need for such a strong reaction like hers.\n\nIf you think that's disgusting, here's a thought for you; I took my cats to the vet and one of them peed in the box on our way home. When I tried to wash him, he put up a bit of a struggle... And slapped me on the face with a tail drenched in pee. If you think having a bit of pee on the bathroom floor is bad, think about having cat pee on your face right next to your eye, and in your hair. \n\nAlso a friendly reminder that while cats don't generally need baths, there are gonna be times in their life where they need one. So get your cat used to baths while they are kittens, and give them a bath every once in a while during their life. I did get my cats used to baths as kittens, but basically never gave them baths after that. I was honestly lucky that my cat obviously didn't want to hurt me; he tried to grab anything around he could, like walls, floor, the shower head etc. but when I put my body in his way to try to stop him from squirming, he even put his claws away. I did get a few scratches, but it seemed to be on accident.", "I didn't read your post, anyone who pisses freely outside of a provided toilet is an asshole.", "Accidents happen.

I can't say it any fucking louder or more clearly: if your partner can't accept that we, as humans, are inherently \"gross\" then you shouldn't date them. They are not an adult. I'm not saying be the grossest version of yourself, but we all fart, poop, piss, burp, etc. If you were squatting in the corner for funsies, I'd get her reaction.

I only hope you didn't uses the same towel on the sink that had been used on the pee.", "NTA, peeing with an erection is difficult because urine and sperm don't mix, so the body tries to prevent that by sealing the other tubes off. You were actively cleaning up after yourself, which was the right thing to do after something like this happens, I'm not sure what more your GF was expecting. Next time, peeing in the shower is self cleaning, and you can have a morning shower with it. Good job on respecting your GF by being concious of her sex drive.

It happened, there was no malice nor negligence in your part, and you immediately took responsibility to clean.
