If she insults Ashley to her face, absolutely jump in. Don't stand for people using the r word around you...absolutely. But all you have done here is hurt Ashley for revenge on your sister. Really not cool. You didn't Ashley any favors.", "Let's just what it is. You're sister pissed you off and you wanted revenge. but, its hard to judge relationships from the outside (sometimes).", "Laura's being extremely horrible to this girl, and by doing it right in front of you, they got you involved in this situation. I understand why you'd feel compelled to protect Ashley in some way. This was not a \"good friendship\" as your mom said.\n\nHowever, there were plenty of ways to do that which wouldn't have involved 1.) illegally recording people without their consent and 2.) using the recording to absolutely crush Ashley.\n\nIt sounds like Laura has a history of this kind of behavior, so you could've started by talking to Ashley about making friends with less toxic people. You might've even set her on the right path without having to tell her about the backstabbing at all and spared her a lot of hurt.\n\nESH", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t a good friendship, it was a toxic one.

Ashley is a sweet girl, you said it herself, she has everyone\u2019s best interests at heart. Laura is the type of person who, frankly, could use being knocked down a peg or two. Maybe losing a good friend like Ashley could be a good kick to have her re-examine how she treats people/talks about them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
