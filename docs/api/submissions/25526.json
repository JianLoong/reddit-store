That is unacceptable. \n\nHowever, I would say call the local animal shelter and find out their procedures. If they seem reasonable and cooperative, turn it over to then. Tell them that you'll be back in 5 (or however many days they require) days to check. Be clear, if the owner hasn't come looking for the pup, then you're going to adopt him. Make them promise (in writing if necessary) not to euthanize the dog and promise (in writing) you'll be back to adopt. \n\nOnce a reasonable period had elapsed, you can return and adopt the dog.

I'm going to tell a story.\n\nI was helping a friend work on his house, and a dalmatian from across the street came over and was barking at us. My friend said to ignore her, she was harmless, and told me a few things about how the owners and their kids neglected the dog. I watched the kids come out and play, and the dog wanted to join in but they just pushed her away and yelled \"Get down!\" and \"Stop!\" After a while they went inside and left the dog sitting and staring at the door.\n\nMy friend went inside to change, and while I sat and waited the dog came over to me. She was very skittish at first, but I just sat and let her come to me. I pet her, and she reacted as if she'd never felt a kind hand before. It was so weird, I've never seen a dog act like that. When my friend came out so we could go get dinner, the dog chased after us. She wasn't around when I dropped him back off, but I very seriously considered coming back to take the dog because I knew she wasn't getting any love or attention that she needed.\n\nAbout a week later my friend told me the dog died of parvo.

But got through the motions of having the puppy's condition documented by your vet and ask if you should get animal control involved as well (more to cover your ass if your neighbor decides to try and go after you for \"stealing\" their puppy, animal control will side with you and not them if they know what is going on in advance).\n\nOr take the advice u/TripleAWingingIt but let the shelter know you'd like to keep the puppy and foster it during the waiting period.

OP is trying to justify not doing the right thing but having a couple of early morning arguments does not make the neighbors bad people or bad pet owners.

I grew up poor as fuck and never in my dreams could I imagine treating an animal this way. There are DOZENS of houseless people who would rather starve than allow any sort of maltreatment to their animals.

Most likely they will be indifferent and give up the dog. \n\nOr even if they are not willing to give up the dog, some reasoning, persuasion and maybe monetary incentive should easily make them let go.\n\nThat's how I got my dog. \nFound a trembling, unfed 3 month old puppy tied to a bush. People in the vicinity said that he was tied there for 2 days Kept him for a few days, and eventually ran into the owners by chance. Without without me even saying anything, they told me that I can keep the dog if I want.\n\nOf course in my case the puppy was probably abandoned, but I'm sure OPs neighbours don't care for their dog much either.", "op needs to speak (respectfully) to the owners of the dog and get this sorted. Communication is the most important thing.", "I love to walk in the rain. Sure, it may look suspicious, but judging should be done after asking.", "6 cups of food for an emaciated puppy is awful. Look up refeeding syndrome - This puppy should not have been fed that much, if he's skinny enough to be called emaciated", "Yes exactly. It\u2019s absolutely possible the neighbors are bad dog owners and bad parents, but there is f enough info in the OP to say either one for sure."]}
