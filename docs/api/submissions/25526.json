I watched the kids come out and play, and the dog wanted to join in but they just pushed her away and yelled \"Get down!\" and \"Stop!\" After a while they went inside and left the dog sitting and staring at the door.\n\nMy friend went inside to change, and while I sat and waited the dog came over to me. She was very skittish at first, but I just sat and let her come to me. I pet her, and she reacted as if she'd never felt a kind hand before. It was so weird, I've never seen a dog act like that. When my friend came out so we could go get dinner, the dog chased after us. She wasn't around when I dropped him back off, but I very seriously considered coming back to take the dog because I knew she wasn't getting any love or attention that she needed.\n\nAbout a week later my friend told me the dog died of parvo.

That weight doesn't just pop back on with  a few good meals. Just being able to \"see the ribs\" doesn't mean it's emaciated or has been starved; without a picture, it could just mean it's underweight/too lean. I have fostered severely underweight dogs and it can take months to get them to a healthy weight - growing puppies need more calories than an adult dog but you can't just overfeed them to get a result quickly.
