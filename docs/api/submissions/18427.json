We asked the builders to leave our letterbox as we don\u2019t want to do a mail redirection and we go past the house every 1-2 days anyway.\n\nAbout a week after we moved out and the house was fenced off to commence building works. We came by nearly every day and, no mail. After a week of no mail we contacted the post office and they said it was weird but they would check with the postman. Postman then advises that our neighbour has told him nobody lives there anymore but she knows where we\u2019ve moved to and so he made him start delivering our mail to her house. \n\nAfter we found out we went and told her to stop that it\u2019s easy for us to collect the mail. We told the postman to keep dropping off in our letterbox and explained the situation. Around this time we had some mail turn up at our new address that our neighbour had written our address and given it back to the postman the next day to re-deliver it (as a return to sender type thing). I was completely baffled. The few items she managed to do this with took 3 weeks to redirect even though we only moved 20 minutes away.\n\nFinally I stopped by the house and straight up told her to stop. She was offended. Said she was doing it out of kindness and making sure nobody stole our mail. I said the only one stealing it was her. Thankfully she stopped doing it because now she is \u201cangry\u201d with us.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: Probably should clarify our neighbour is an elderly lady, she\u2019s nice but also very nosy.
