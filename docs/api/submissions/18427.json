OP needs to contact the postmaster because that is reckless negligence on the part of that delivery worker.", "If OP is in the US that's grounds for termination...", "Nah mate. In the US a person can only get free mail delivery in a currently occupied house. Houses with obvious signs of temporary abandoned for renovation have their mail placed on a 10 day hold.

She has too much time on her hands and should be minding her own business.", "You should've had the mail held or redirected it since it's a year; you could do a 30 day hold if in the US and pick up every couple of weeks, then do a new hold but certainly easier to change addresses.", "NTA.
