It's all forgotten the day after, and over the years, it's almost become something of a tradition, like we kinda just egg each other on, blow off some steam. Like, I said it's usually not a big issue. It's all just how we roll, and we even joke about it.\n\nWhile my friend Matt and I were going at it, my girlfriend walked in, and all of sudden, see she's never really been around us, so she started freaking out, and then we all kinda just left super awkwardly, with all of us kind of feeling awkward and weird.\n\nThe next day I confronted my girlfriend about it, saying that she made me and my friends feel ashamed and uncomfortable in my own home with her weird reaction, and now we're not talking to each other.

It sounds like you're embarrassed because your girlfriend reacted, as any normal person would. Do yourself a favor and seek therapy to figure out why you act like this with your friends. No. It's not normal behavior. I don't think it has anything to do with your girlfriend. She found out you have issues, so now you need to deal with them. It's easier to blame her than to admit you've got emotional problems.", "Yeah dude YTA. If my partner EVER acted like that I\u2019d be out of there. These weird machismo screaming matches you\u2019ve got going on are NOT normal and super toxic and your girlfriends probably scared of you now. I hope she dumps you and finds a decent dude cause you\u2019re\u2026certainly not that.", "YTA - Not because of how you and your friend interact with one another, that's between you all, but because you claim your gf overreacted. You admit she doesn't know/hasn't seen this side of you and your group of friends. You caught her off guard, and her reaction to how you were behaving was totally normal for someone who doesn't know the sort of dynamic you all have. Also, this sort of method of \"blowing off steam\" definitely doesn't seem normal. I can only imagine that *anyone* walking into a scene like the one your gf did would act the same way.", "YTA. And also, a good advert for gun control.", "YTA - A bunch of drunk guy with guns laying around are screaming at each other????? \n\nAny sane person would be disturbed by this. OP and his friends have some serious issues. Literally anyone would feel uncomfortable to be around people this unhinged.\n\nHeads up OP, a lot of people would dip out and call the cops. Letting the police know that a bunch of drunks with guns are in each other\u2019s face, screaming. Good way to get shot.", "YTA. I'm not going to go deep in your \"tradition\", but knowing this could happen what about a heads up before the party? Her reaction is the normal reaction to a situation which seems pretty agressive based on how you describe It.", "Sorry let me just check. \n\nGirlfriend is in her home. \n\nGirlfriend hears raised voices. \n\nGirlfriend hears yelling about guns. \n\nGirlfriend walks into room and sees her boyfriend and another man screaming in each others faces. \n\nShe reacts. \n\nAnd you think SHE\u2019S the AH????\n\nYea. No. YTA.", "Um. She didn\u2019t overreact.

That behavior is horrifying, and if I was your girlfriend, I would truly rethink the relationship and question how safe I feel with a partner who thinks this is okay.", "YTA -- If you are going to have a guy's night with tip-of-the-iceberg violence as its apex, don't invite your GF, or at very least brief her on the testosterone that's going to be flung.  It's now your job to apologize to everyone and smooth things over.  Good luck.", "YTA, because you expect your girlfriend to know something you never made her aware of. How should she have known you make this (objectively quite disturbing) thing with your friends? She walked in, saw you yelling and fighting at a friend, of course she freaked out.

So why not explain it to your girlfriend instead of making her into the bad guy? She was just concerned because y\u2019all got some weird ritual going on that you never explained to her. It would\u2019ve been weird if she said nothing when y\u2019all were screaming in each other\u2019s faces.

Why do you need to act  like a bunch of macho Rambo type  AH'S yelling and screaming at each other ,that your girlfriend basically was in actual fear for her safety. \n\nYou are all mad becuase you and your friends basically got called out on your bs machismo. \nYou and your friends owe your girlfriend a massive appolgy for being a bunch of AH'S and for scaring her the way you did.\n\nAnd grow up. No excuses for your bs so called tradition of being massive AH'S", "So, you were drinking, had guns about, and angrily screaming in each other's faces. Yeah, a normal person would freak out walking into that. You and your buddies have a tradition of getting drunk and fighting, that's not normal. \n\nYTA, you need to stop mixing anger, alcohol, and guns. The fact that you're so casual about it and think it's all normal is concerning.", "You\u2019re slow asf, YTA", "I hesitate to say who is or isn\u2019t the AH here but I do feel like maybe some explanation should\u2019ve been given to your girlfriend prior to you inviting her if this is a traditional thing that always happens. It\u2019s going to be anyones instinct to react negatively to an argument or confrontation that involves a loved one. \n\nSo, in that regard it kind of does make you a tiny bit of an AH. Unless of course I\u2019m missing something. But truly I chalk this up to bad communication and differences between how you operate with friends vs how she is with hers.", "YTA. WTF? Maybe her reaction is telling you it\u2019s time to grow up.", "YTA and so are your friends.\n\n\"I feel like she shouldn't have been butting in for no reason.\"\n\nShe thought you two were about to fight.

Third, you could have just explained to her you were messing around and weren't really upset, but apparently you couldn't be bothered to?", "YTA how did you think she'd react? Did you immediately try to calm her down and tell her what you told us? That this is how yall blow off steam?", "YTA, toxic masculinity personified with your dumb drunken violent dick measuring contests. This is not normal nor should it be, it seems very insecure and weird and it's probably toxic as fuck to be around. Not once did you ever consider her experience, she's prob home taking care of everything while you go fuck around and get drunk and violent with your boys. It's probably so exhausting for her", "YTA\n\nLike the others I have to say this is bizarre, toxic behavior. \n\nShe's probably very reasonably concerned that someday you'll handle conflict with HER that way. \n\nEspecially because you then got in her face about it so that she'll react less. No. Absolutely not. Reacting negatively to loud, potentially violent anger is a VERY normal reaction that should not be stifled.", "So you guys regularly:\n\n1) get hammered\n2) get into screaming matches\n3) about the guns you have with you while you are drunk and fighting\n\nYTA even before factoring in the GF.", "Wtf?

Find friends who don\u2019t need to be aggressive with each other to \u201cblow off steam\u201d and act like normal humans.", "YTA: Not for the yelling between friends or approaching a conversation you had with your GF, but for your insistence that she shouldn't have been butting in. She lives with you and sees an argument going on in her home and she should just walk away? *Maybe* you can get through to her that this is just the best thing to do now, if she feels that's OK with her, but you hadn't done that before. But related to that, maybe not. This is her home too and she shouldn't have to put up with a bunch of semi-drunk dudes acting like jackasses. That is normal for (some) dudes, and yes dudes get over stuff like this no problem, but that doesn't mean you get to do it at your own home any more. Sorry man, that's the breaks of living with your GF.", "Please excuse me while I yell at my GF for her TRAUMA response. YTA", "YTA. You are an absolutely awful boyfriend.", "She saw two drunk men (one who is her boyfriend who she cares about) screaming and getting in each-others faces \u2026.", "Wow dude of course YTA you said it yourself she's never experienced any of that before. She wasn't being intrusive. She was investigating what all the screaming was about, as most people would. Unless I'm missing something it seems y'all now live together so how about you just give your gf a heads up about things like this in the future. Problem solved.", "First world problems. \nDon't really care.", "YTA\n\nYou all are drunk and she walks in and sees one drunk guy all up in her drunk boyfriend's face. Can you not see how YOU made HER feel uncomfortable?", "NAH\n\nI think you probably just need to explain to her what was going on and that it is a normal thing that you and your friends do.  If she's not familiar with it and she just walks in to find you and your friend yelling in each other's faces it probably scared her and had her thinking something bad was about to happen (like a fight).  If you just explain to her that this is something you guys normally do, she'll probably be fine with it.", "INFO\n\nDid you ever tell your gf that this is how you and your idiot friends deal with disagreements?", "YTA.\n\nShe reacted like a normally socialized adult when exposed to a violent ish behavior.  Your little tradition *ISN'T NORMAL* and you admit that she isn't accustomed to seeing you with your fellow assholes being assholes this way.\n\n\nShe wasn't overreacting and you were and are being a crap BF by giving her grief over this and minimizing her feelings.\n\n\nGrow up if you value female companionship that isn't charged by the hour.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
