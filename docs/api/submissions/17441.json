Actions that we take to resolve what we perceive to be an issue are very often met with accusations that we are overreacting, irrational, hysterical, etc. When we have emotional responses to things, we are often told that we are being over-emotional, and that women are \"more emotional\" and less logical than men. The need for our emotional response to be validated before further conversation stems from the self doubt engrained here. We want to know our feelings don't mean we are irrational or over-reacting. We don't jump right to problem-solving because we first need to be sure that the problem is real by other people affirming it. \n\nI am not saying men have it easy in the emotion department, or that boys were always validated. The way that men were socialized isn't better. Boys aren't usually taught to doubt their perspective of an issue or accused of being irrational for being upset, so they don't necessarily have this self doubt that women tend towards.

He can't complain about coworker when he's at home. Full stop.

But he can't keep bringing that baggage home to drop on me. If he feels he *needs* to vent about a situation, he can ask me if I'm mentally okay enough to listen.

Emotions are inherently reactive and not logical.  If a woman experiences an emotion that many would agree is an overreaction to the situation, so what? It doesn\u2019t change the fact that she is experiencing that emotion.  It doesn\u2019t matter what you are reacting to or why, as much as if you are experiencing an emotion or not. Emotions are an entirely personal subjective experience, so if you tell me you are experiencing an emotion, then okay you are experiencing that emotion. \n\nThe way you describe it makes it seem like this is the conversation:\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m feeling frustrated, but I have so much self doubt socialized in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYup, sounds like you *are* frustrated. And btw, that\u2019s a really common feeling that humans experience all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, I guess I *am* valid.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like women are trying to make sure the problem is real before moving on, because they often feel extremely invalidated if they are told they are in fact making a mountain out of a mole hill. It seems like they are much more interested in having their subjective experience of it being a problem validated, which like, okay if you tell me you had a subjective experience, it\u2019s impossible to invalidate that so it\u2019s automatically valid that you *felt* there was a problem.  \n\nBut then, what do you need me for if I\u2019m just here to believe that you experienced a subjective experience the way you describe it? It seems like it would be easier to go to therapy, unlearn the self-doubt and go: \u201cI know I had that subjective experience because I\u2019m the one who experienced it, and because I\u2019m a human who experienced this, it\u2019s a valid subjective human experience.\u201d\n\nIf they want to talk about the \u2018problem\u2019 from a logical standpoint, we can discuss whether it\u2019s a real problem and options for solving it.  If they want to know whether their subjective experience is \u2018valid\u2019, even if it\u2019s them getting enraged about a child benignly waving at them, then of course it a \u2018valid\u2019 subjective experience, simply because it was experienced. \n\nWith the OP, why would she need to keep venting over and over about the same thing. Shouldn\u2019t she have learned by now that it is valid to feel frustration about the laundry, and not need to be constantly re-validated?"]}
