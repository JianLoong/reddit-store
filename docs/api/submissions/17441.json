Sometimes people just want to let it out. Maybe she's tried all these solutions to no avail? It just would make me really sad to get shut down like that. Maybe you should apologize for being insensitive to her stressors and ask if she is looking for solutions to the issue.", "No I don't think you're the a****** here but I do think that if you love your wife you have to let her rant, she's going to do it anyway.
