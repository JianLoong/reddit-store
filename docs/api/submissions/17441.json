She would be asking for ways to fix the situation. She\u2019s literally just talking. Treat it the same way you would an enthusiastic friend talking about a video game or sportsball. She\u2019s just sharing a snippet of her day with you. Grow up.", "ESH. Same thing, day after day, week after week, month after month.  Eventually you hit a point where you \u2026just\u2026can\u2019t\u2026hear\u2026it\u2026yet\u2026again.  The AH part wasn\u2019t in not hearing it, it was in not recognizing your breaking point and removing yourself from the situation.  There is nothing wrong with taking a walk to regain your composure. Your wife is the AH because all she does vent about a volunteer job. For goodness sake if she cared about you as much as she did her volunteer job she would either say something, do something, or find a different position to volunteer for.", "INFO: Can you be more specific about what the issue is here? She complains about something she likely won't be able to change to you, her spouse. What about that is the problem?", "> I simply had it and asked her to be reassigned, quit, ask for help from administration, or just stop complaining. There is only so much I can hear about it.\n\nInfo: how exactly did this interaction go?\nIt's totally fine to set a boundary that you don't want to engage in conversation about this, but if it's the first time you've done it and you snapped, told her to make changes so she won't complain about it to you, and generally didn't validate her feelings at all, then YTA.", "YTA for shutting down what she felt was a safe space to vent. We all have shitty things about our jobs and the one thing that helps is going home and telling our partner about it. There's a way to phrase your feelings better. \"hey I'm really feeling a little low tonight and it stresses me out to hear about this repeatedly when I've offered solutions.\" Or even just asking what she wants, if she's looking for advice or just a place to vent. Sometimes people just want to let it out. Maybe she's tried all these solutions to no avail? It just would make me really sad to get shut down like that. Maybe you should apologize for being insensitive to her stressors and ask if she is looking for solutions to the issue.", "No I don't think you're the a****** here but I do think that if you love your wife you have to let her rant, she's going to do it anyway. If she does it anyway and it pisses you off it's a lose-lose situation. So let her rent and think about baseball", "YTA your wife needed to vent. Not have you problem solve for her.", "YTA. Sometimes we need to vent about things that we find annoying in our daily lives, and as a partner is your place to be supportive and let her vent, even if you've heard it several times before. \n\nI honestly have no idea what the issue is about (dirty towels? dirty undies? it's irrelevant maybe), but if you find it disgusting to discuss at dinner, you can nicely and politely ask her to talk about it after dinner.", "YTA because you made her responsible for your feelings. \n\nThe NonAH move would be to first empathize that you totally get how hard this must be for her. THEN express that even so, you feel frustrated and burned out by hearing about it so often, and that you wish you could help her in some way, and suggest a compromise of some sort so that she can still vent but you aren\u2019t overwhelmed by it. It\u2019s not her job to not annoy you, it\u2019s your job to find a way to not be annoyed.", "Seriously?\n\n>!they use it for a wank!<", "The former. I wasn't sure if spelling it out would cross the line.\n\n\nWhen I went to school there were a lot of hijinks.

Ours was a long term school while the wife's is short term, so she is worried about broaching the subject at all.", "I told her that I already gave my advice and wanted to eat dinner for the upteenth time. I don't want to hear about it while dipping my chicken wings in ranch.", "It's not a job, though, he said she's a volunteer. So she doesn't have to do this job at all.", "That isn't bad advice at all. She has mentioned before that she just wants to vent and doesn't need my opinion, but this one rant just keeps.on.coming.up.", "Sounds like this isn't a one off event.\n\nI think if someone complained about the same thing a couple nights a week for more than 2 or 3 weeks, and wouldn't do anything to change their circumstances, I'd get a little annoyed.\n\nI'm 100% down to listen to someone vent. If you're venting about the same thing all the time and make no effort to fix it, you just seem like you enjoy having something to complain about.
