You need to protect yourself and looking after yourself financially is hugely important. I've had so many friends fall foul of something like this, taking car finance or a loan for a GF who one day became an ex, I had one friend who broke up with a girl, she stopped making finance payments because he took it out in his name for her and it stopped him getting a mortgage 3 years later as it impacted his credit score. \nYou've made an adult decision, she also needs to be adult about it and understand this isn't about trust in your relationship", "NTA.

You are being financially mature and responsible. NEVER put money into an account you can't access. She should understand that.

If you do it, that shows you are serious about our relationship, etc etc. If the other person argues not with logic or reason, but presents guilt and emotional manipulation then do not fall for it.

I would quicker judge her than you.", "NTA\n\nif she died tomorrow legally her parents would likely inherit her assets. no guarantee you would get your money back then either. it sounds extreme but i had a relative die without a will. their fianc\u00e9 had to sue for their assets once paternity was established per lawyer advice. when the suit was successful as they were not fighting it they came home excited at being sued and all went out to dinner to celebrate. because no one liked the situation. but if that child hadn't existed getting the assets sorted would have been a lot harder.\n\n dying with no will leaves your assets to next of kin. right now that isn't you, not even if you were engaged. at least not in my local jurisdiction.", "NTA if she wants to have a joint account for that, then together you can look for other account options that you can both be on, and she can transfer what she would like into that account and you can deposit what you like into that account.    \n\n\nI used to work for a divorce attorney, prenups are just smart, and anything you put into an account with her name on it is money you will have no right to if you break up, unless you had some sort of contract in writing that specifies you would be entitled to half of that account (or whatever portion you have contributed)  In this case though, you would also need to keep a detailed account of the transactions you make depositing the money into that account.  So, no, you are NTA", "NTA. Her excuses sound super fishy. Can you open an account where her account is to see if you can get the same interest rate but have the account in your name and separate from her money?", ">She asked why and I just said I wasn't comfortable putting my money into an account I have no access to and if anything did happen to the relationship I could have lost a lot of money.\n\nThese are reasonable concerns that any mature couple should be able to talk about. \n\n>She took this as me saying I think we'll break up\n\nThis is a childish response to something completely reasonable. \n\nNTA.", "Alternatively, ask her to sign a contract that states all moneys you deposit into that account is for the sole purpose of purchasing a home TOGETHER. If the relationship dissolves before said purchase all monies you deposited(including earned interest) is to be returned to you. If she balks at that I would say you have your answer on her true intentions. Otherwise you have been smart and in no way are the asshole.", "NTA. She isn\u2019t your wife.", "NTA Never ever put your money where it\u2019s not accessible to you! That\u2019s a huge ask and a bigger risk!!!", "NTA You don't merge finances unless you are married and even then it's not always a great idea.", "She is pushing you to propose, bro.\n\nNTA, your stance is financially responsible here. There are other issues that may be up for a honest discussion.", "NTA. Do not share a bank account until you have the legal protections of marriage. Before that keep your money separate. While marriage isn\u2019t a guarantee you do have some recourse in the case of theft.", "NTA. If your name cannot be added it is incredibly risky. Even if you didn\u2019t break up, what if she died in a car accident? Then who gets her bank accounts? Parents? Either a joint account or save individually", "NTA\n\nHard pass, never mix finances with people who can\u2019t discuss finances without being emotions into it. \n\nFinances are a data conversation not a feeling conversation.", "Nta you shouldn't do it. And breaking up isn't the reason. If the worst happen and she passed away your name isn't on the account there for you would lose all the money. It would be inherited by next of kin", "NTA This is what you call smart. Your money might be OK and you would get a \"slightly better interest rate OR your money might never  be returned to you. It isn't like it can come back at all if you break up from the sound of it, since the account is for homebuying and inaccessible basically until then. She gonna pay you out of her regular account? She gonna include the interest?", "Nope NTA! I would be cautious too. At the end of the day you have no idea what might happen in the future, no one plans to break up. But breakups happen. It\u2019s life. And if things went bad there\u2019s nothing in place for you to get your money back from her. You have to be so cautious!! I would have said the exact same thing. \n\nYou did the right thing! Keep your finances in check", "NTA and honestly this sounds like a red flag for boundaries moving forward. Being protective of your own money has nothing to do with assuming you\u2019ll break up. It\u2019s more and more common for even married couples to have separated finances. Maybe you guys need a good sit down, maybe with a relationship counselor, and talk about healthy boundaries in a relationship.", "N t a .... scam", "Nta", "Never involve money. Savings need to stay seperate or have both names on it. You both can contribute to saving for a house without you blindly giving her money. \nRule for the wise, when shit goes sour it goes SOUR.\nDon't allow others to have financial control over you.", "NTA. It\u2019s a massive risk if you are not named on the account, even if you are together forever or married.  If the account owner was to die or become unable to manage their finances, you\u2019d have an incredibly difficult time accessing that account not being a joint owner, beneficiary, Power of Attorney, or executor of the estate.", "Guess you'te talking about a help to buy ISA that she has. I know you can't get a help to buy ISA any more but you could look at a Lifetime ISA as it also has a bonus scheme for first time buyers.\n\nThe help to buy ISA is meant to be just for her savings. ISA literally stands for individual savings account. Her wanting you to put your money into it isn't what that account is for. Also, it only allows payments into the account by standing order once per month with a max payment of \u00a3200.00. Any other payments outside the one monthly SO would just be rejected back to one of her other accounts most likely.\n\nEdited to add judgement. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou're definitely not the asshole for protecting yourself.\n\nDo you think you'll break up? No, but do you think you MIGHT break up? That it's a possibility?\n\nOf course you do, as you should. That's all the reason you need.", "NTA. If it's something you both really want and you can save more money this way, see a lawyer and draw up a contract similar to a pre-nup to protect your assets. If that can't be done, keep your money where it is!", "I assume this is the \u201cHelp to Buy ISA\u201d?? I opened one of those a few days before they stopped them. I asked my husband to open one but he forgot and ended up missing out. We are MARRIED and yet I don\u2019t think he should be contributing to my own ISA. I\u2019m also aware the max contribution per month is \u00a3200, so is she already providing that? If so, it makes no sense for you to add more money.", "NTA\n\nBut just so you know, putting your name on the account doesn\u2019t provide that much protection. When I opened a joint account with my now-husband, the bank person made sure to be very clear (repeating at least three times) that the account and all the money in it belongs to both of us and the bank cannot and will not prevent one person from draining it, because it\u2019s \u2018their\u2019 money too (it\u2019s not 50/50, both people are entitled to use the account for whatever they like). You have to have a lot of trust to use joint accounts (I do, I have fully merged finances with my husband)", "NTA but you're a fool if you put cash into an account you have no rights or access to.", "NTA 100% \n\nbut just to explain I think OP is talking about a help to buy ISA in UK , these literally do not exist to open anymore, the scheme was closed and she won\u2019t be able to add OP onto the account \n\nThe scheme was to encourage first time buyers and it is you can add up to \u00a3200 a month and the government gives you 25% on top of it up to \u00a33,000, so it\u2019s only ever worth putting \u00a312k maximum in this account\n\nYes it was a good deal for your first home and I can see why the girlfriend thinks it\u2019s a good idea, if she\u2019s filling the \u00a3200 a month there is zero point \n\nHelp to buy ISA you have to use all the money on a deposit - you need money for more than that when buying a property so tying all money in here may not be wise \n\nAlso, and hope OP sees this part as it may be worth looking into if a first time buyer. \n\nThe lifetime isa scheme is still running and is similar(ish)\n\nThis give 25% on max \u00a34 k per year but no upper limit (it can be used in retirement or for first property only)", "Even adding your name to the account doesn't necessarily give you protections. The other other person could still empty and close the account without your consent. Bank doesn't really care because they are an authorized account holder. How or why someone empties the account, with or without the other account owners consent isn't their issue."]}
