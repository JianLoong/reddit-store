And then, in that case - you can open the same account for yourself.", "NTA. She's trying to position this as a trust and commitment issue, but if it's a joint account, you need access to the funds, too. What if she's in an accident? What if she's out of town and you need access to that cash for some emergency?", "NTA.  Have a calm and honest discussion about finances and expectations.  If having a joint account for shared expenses or major purchases is a thing you want (there are both advantages and risks), make a new one both of your names.", "Why do people just dream up stuff to be mad about??? What if there was an emergency and she was out of town and you needed the money?? There are so many reasons it should be accessible to both depositors. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you made decision based on reasonable logic. You shouldn't put yourself at risk. \nUnless she can't ensure your money will be safe in case something will go wrong with the relationship I suggest new account with both your names on it so you are equally protected.", "Absolutely NTA. You need to protect yourself and looking after yourself financially is hugely important. I've had so many friends fall foul of something like this, taking car finance or a loan for a GF who one day became an ex, I had one friend who broke up with a girl, she stopped making finance payments because he took it out in his name for her and it stopped him getting a mortgage 3 years later as it impacted his credit score. \nYou've made an adult decision, she also needs to be adult about it and understand this isn't about trust in your relationship", "NTA. Forget breaking up, if say she dies, her legal next of kin which isn't you would get the account. So yeah unless she's willing to add your name to the account no dice.", "NTA - it IS a massive risk. Sounds like you guys need to have open and honest discussions about finances, and, if appropriate, have your name added to the account.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let any of the emotional pieces get in the way of making sure you\u2019re still financially protected. If you\u2019re offering to still contribute half of the deposit then you\u2019re being very fair. If she wants a joint account then get one with both of your names on it", "NTA\n\nIt's simple enough to create a joint account that you *both* have access to (I'm not suggesting that you *should*, prior to getting married, but you *could*). She could even add you to her existing account.\n\nOr you could create your own dedicated savings account to save for the deposit, if the problem is she can't \"see\" what you're saving if it's mixed in with your other savings.\n\nThat her only acceptable option is for you to contribute money into her (sole-access) account is a red flag, as far as I'm concerned. Propose some of the other options and see how she reacts.\n\n(However, I would *not* recommend throwing in a straw man that *you* create an account solely in your name that *she* contributes to (\"What's the problem, dearest; you think we'll break up?\").)", "NTA - You made a good call. Even if the interest is higher, it won't make a big difference.", "NTA. Definitely don\u2019t do it. If she can\u2019t see how that would worry you then tell her you\u2019ll make a new account and she can give money to you to put into to account. I didn\u2019t combine our bank accounts until I was engaged and we stopped splitting everything 50-50.", "NTA \n\nWhy not offer to open a new joint savings for the house fund? Find one with the best interest rate.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t put funds in an account I didn\u2019t have access to the statement, to the funds. If something happens to your gf, the account goes to her estate. How would you get your money back?\n\nYour gf is setting this up as a trust thing. I would expect someone I\u2019m with the respect me enough to make sure I had access to our funds.", "NTA why can't she have your name added to the account?", "NTA if you are going to have a joint savings with someone you are not married to both need to put in equal amounts and it should not have an atm card but requires 2 signatures to withdraw money. It isn't saying you think you will break up, it's saying I am a realistic adult that realizes even 50 year marriages break down. Money has ruined many relationships. Being 100% open with shared money is just realistic.", "NTA, the fact that she pressures you into this is a big red flag. You either need a joined account or save sepay before the downpayment.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. \n\nWouldn\u2019t she want add you to that account if she is planning that kind of future with you? Why do you have to put money into something completely unprotected?", "NTA at all. What happens if things go sideways in your relationship? Willing to bet you won't see that money again", "NTA, your money, your account. If you're serious about buying a house with her, open a new, separate account, in your name, and start putting a percentage of your money in with every paycheck.  I wouldn't feel comfortable putting my money in someone else's name.", "NTA. it's your money, do whatever you think is best with it. however, i do think you and your gf need to have a clear conversation about this, since she seems to think that you want to break up with her.", "NTA \n\n- sounds like you have common sense and are protective over what\u2019s yours. this relationship is still fresh. do what you want with YOUR money", "NTA.  Don't do it. You already stated you have no problem with your half.", "Nta fucking hate when you wanna be realistic in situations that actually warrant be reasonable, someone wanna be like \"oh so you don't trust me?\" Like mf anything can happen\ud83e\udd26", "NTA at all.  You're not married, it's financially responsible to keep your money separate at this point.", "NTA - Suggest that you will open an account in YOUR name and she can contribute part of HER savings to it. See how serious she is about the relationship then.", "NTA, OP do not deposit money into an account where you are not a signer/joint account holder. If money goes into an account styled as an individual account, that money is under full control of that account holder. That means they can close that account and receive proceeds, they can withdraw and have use of those funds.  You won\u2019t be able to dispute any of those actions just because you also funded some of the deposits: credits coming into and individual account belong to that individual.\n\nI understand not being able to open the same type of account anymore to obtain same rates, but if she does not add you to the account, open your own, perhaps a cd or time deposit might help to earn more interest. Even if you are both joint account holders, each account holder has rights to the funds, so if you or she has concerns that one or the other of you would withdraw without consent of the other, best not to combine.  Speaking as a back office banker who sometimes has to break the news that joint account holder was in fact entitled to withdraw funds even if other account holder is claiming we shouldn\u2019t have allowed the transaction\u2026keep it separate and you are in control of your own funds ownership.", "NTA\n\nYour money = your name = your account.\n\nTo win a small amount more is not worth the risk to lose the money given on the  account of your gf.", "Joint account - 2 to sign for withdrawals that way 1 can\u2019t drain account.", "NTA\n\nNever create fictional joint resources. If this is what she wants, it's so easy to create a joint account (which is still risky for people who aren't married).", "NTA \u2026 you are being pragmatic and financially wise.\n\nIf this is a hill she is willing to die on, ask her to either put your name on the account or deposit her money into your account \u2026 she what she says.", "NTA. Things happen that are so unpredictable sometimes. You\u2019re willing to pay if y\u2019all buy a house still, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t. You just would rather keep that money in your account until the time comes and i think that\u2019s fair.", "NTA shit happens ask my BIL who was married for 20 years then got dumped on out of the blue, so at this stage this is cautious but the right way to go. Open your own ISA or joint one?", "NTA. Either create a joint account to put the money or continue to do it how you are. Word of caution, having both of your names on the account doesn\u2019t protect you either. Either of you could go in and drain the account and the other would not be able to do anything about it. I was screwed over this way once!", "NTA. Too many risks. When you do buy a place, sign a not married equivalent of a pre nup. Seen so many break ups...", "Goodness gracious! NTA Don't do it!", "NTA. You\u2019re right, you shouldn\u2019t risk your finances. Taking from your savings at the time of purchase is a much better option than just handing it over to your girlfriend.", "NTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to put money into a savings account, it needs to be in both of your names and you need to set it up so that you both have to approve any transactions or withdrawals that take place. \n\nIf your relationship goes downhill and it\u2019s all in an account in her name, then that could turn into a nightmare of a scenario for you. \n\nI see it as a bit of a red flag that she\u2019s now throwing a you\u2019re not \u201cserious about the relationship\u201d line at you for you literally being sensible about saving. It sounds like a line meant to coerce you into doing what she wants in this scenario.", "NTA\nIt's not just splitting up, what if something happens to her? Then you have zero legal standing.", "NTA.  Never, never put money into an account that you have no access to.", "NTA.  You are allowed to be your own person separate from the relationship.  Her insecurity and getting offended is not your problem and I would view this as a red flag.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with your request and she is gaslighting you.", "NTA and her insistence you put it into her account is a red flag.", "\"I will deposit money into your savings account if you agree to sign a contract stating that if the relationship ends or if we do not end up buying a house, I will get back the amount I deposited plus the interest it accrued.\"\n\nNTA", "The type of account isn't available anymore otherwise I would", "Yeah something I thought I included but just realised I haven't is she has slightly better interest rates and you can't open that type of account anymore. I'll add this to the main post", "Then find another option or have her add your name to the account. If you name can't be added then it's safer to just keep saving in your own accounts.\n\nEdit to include judgement. Definitely NTA", "Once you put money in that account it is no longer yours.  It\u2019s hers.  You can\u2019t make withdrawal, and if she dies it goes to her next of kin (unless she specifically designated you as pod).  I wouldn\u2019t ever put a penny in any savings account that did not have my name on it.", "I doubt the slight difference in interest rates will make enough of a difference that it\u2019s worth not having any access to your own money."]}
