It smelt like straight bud. It leaked into my whole place and I had a really hard time sleeping or breathing. The next morning I knocked on my neighbors door (only 3 apartments per complex and I\u2019m in the middle.) I told them about my condition and if they could please not smoke indoors as it really bothers my health. The neighbor scoffed at me and said \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about\u201d and closed the door. This happened 3 more nights in a row and I could barely even be in my apartment. So the next day I contacted the apartment manager and explained to them the situation. About 3 days ago I hear knocking at my door and it\u2019s the neighbor.

You did not get them evicted.\n\nThat woman\u2019s own actions got her evicted.\n\nYou even gave her a warning by asking her not to smoke indoors. \n\nShe could have stopped smoking. She could have smoked outdoors. She could have simply not rented in a no-smoking complex.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t. And now she is paying the price.\n\nThis is not your fault. You deserve to be able to breathe.", "NTA, I smoke tons of weed, and there are plenty of ways to still smoke and not bother your neighbors. She could have bought edibles, bought a cart, opened a window, rolled a joint and smoked outside, used a sploof, etc. She chose to do none of those things probably in violation of her lease, putting your health at risk, and got herself evicted for it.", "NTA. You addressed her directly, which is a great approach. You explained the situation and asked her to not smoke. She broke the rules and then proceeded to do it more times. You have a right to live comfortably in your own home, especially when health is concerned. She made the choices she made so she got herself evicted. You did not get her evicted.", "NTA - You have a health condition.  They broke the rules which were grounds for eviction.  Should have told her it was her problem alone that got her kicked out, not you.", "NTA - You moved into a non-smoking building, specifically because it was non-smoking. Even if your neighbors disagreed with the rule, they signed a lease that prohibited it. They are the problem here, not you.", "NTA.\n\nYou must take care of yourself before you take care of others. This principle applies to\n\n1. You, for obvious reasons. You have here taken care of both yourself and others by searching for a place with a strict non-smoking policy, by giving a fair airing of grievance to the neighbor, then by going to the apartment manager as a next resort. I do not believe you were obligated to approach the neighbor again given their immediately resuming the behavior, which either intentionally or recklessly harmed you.\n\n2. The apartment manager, who has an interest in avoiding legal liability under both the terms of your lease and, if you gave any explanation of your medical condition, under the Americans With Disabilities Act. And at 24 years old, working, recently promoted, any lawsuit by you could cost the complex a royal crapload of money. It is more important for them to stay in business rather than give any extra consideration to the other tenant. Or you, for that matter. But given a choice, why should they not choose you, who have no record of lease-breaking and fit their preferred customer profile?\n\nI want to emphasize again that your conversation with the manager presented a grave and possibly mortal threat to the business.\n\n...3. And finally the other tenant wasn't acting in her own best interests when she broke the lease, with full knowledge that she was doing so, and even set out to intentionally or recklessly harm you when given a warning. I do not believe the conflict is an equal one.", "NTA-\n\nNo one gets evicted for just one thing. This was a string of issues between the neighbor and management. You handled it correctly and they brought this on themselves.", "NTA. They got themselves evicted. Don't give it another thought.", "NTA", "An A-H is someone who puts their own wants above someone else's needs. \n\nBeing able to breathe is about as close to the pure definition of \"need\" as there is. Even if your neighbor was legitimately self-medicating with cannabis, doing it in a non-smoking complex when they've been warned that it's hurting their neighbor's health is about as A-H as it gets.

You made a clear request for her to follow the no smoking policy for a very good reason, and she not only ignored you but also continued blatantly disregarding your health as well as the health of her daughter.", "NTA and also NTA even if you did intentionally get them evicted. They were breaking the lease and compromising your health.", "NTA. It costs $0 to step outside to smoke and not do it in the goddamn bathroom.", "Well as long as you can sleep at night knowing there's a mother and her child homeless now.
