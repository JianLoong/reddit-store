I hope to have a family some day but for right now I'm just dating and saving money. \n\nFor the last few years I've been using my Christmas bonus to buy my parents, siblings, and siblings cool Christmas gifts. I am lucky enough to be earning much more than I need and I have an excellent nest egg going for when I'm ready. My parents and my siblings aren't there. My folks were immigrants and while they own their home and, as far as I know, are debt free, they do not have a huge retirement account. My older brother and sister each decided independently to start their families while they were quite young in my opinion. \n\nSo anyway like I said I have been blowing my bonus on all of them for the last while. I paid for my parents to visit their home country. I bought both of my siblings families a PS5 when they were hard to get. My nephew started university this fall. I got him a new laptop last Christmas as a graduation/Christmas present. \n\nI do not resent spending this money. I love my family. And I do not expect them to reciprocate, I already buy myself whatever I want. However I noticed something this year. It was my thirtieth birthday and none of them did anything for me. \n\nSo I asked my girlfriend of she wanted to go to Asia for New Years. She is a student so I am paying for everything. We are seeing our families for Christmas and leaving on Boxing Day. \n\nI got to my parents yesterday afternoon and put my gifts for everyone under the tree. I got everyone a $50 gift card for the movies. There are twelve of them so that's still $600. \n\nMy SIL decided to sneak a peak at her gift. She thought I was snubbing her so she told everyone that I got her a shit gift. \n\nHuge fight. I just left and went back to my hotel. Calls and texts nonstop. I was being greedy, immature, callous, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I just blocked them. I can spend the next few days as a tourist in my home town and then leave. I told my girlfriend what happened with my family and she has my back. \n\nI think they are acting entitled and taking me for granted. I don't think that they are assholes but I don't think I am either.", "created_utc": 1703244529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ocukx/aita_for_using_money_for_my_familys_christmas/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are absolutely taking you for granted. They didn\u2019t have to spend money on you but to not arrange a nice birthday dinner at someone\u2019s home or SOMETHING when you do so much for them is bonkers disrespectful and entitled. \n\nIf you hope to salvage some relationship with them I do think you should tell them exactly why you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to get them huge presents anymore. For one thing it\u2019s not your job to do that. It\u2019s nice of you that you do but it\u2019s not something I think is appropriate. It does lead to expectations that you\u2019ll have to break when you have a family of your own anyways.\n\nYou should tell them you were disappointed when they didn\u2019t even come over on your bday. That it\u2019s not about money but you feel like your just a money bag to your family and you don\u2019t want to just be that to them so you\u2019ve decided to change the dynamic and from now on you\u2019ll still give gifts but more reasonable, normal sized gifts. You want to be someone important to them and not just a check. \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t go well go NC for a while. You don\u2019t need people in your life that just view you as a source of money.", "NTA - what a horrible response! They ARE being AHs & you have a right to reproach them & ask them why they would treat you like that if they actually love you. That is NOT how family should treat each other. I would skip your family festivities this year & let them know you expect an apology from them. Enjoy your overseas holiday!", "NTA you still got them something and they're still complaining. It's your money to do what you want with. Sounds like they've got used to you being so generous and are taking it for granted.", "NTA. Calling someone greedy for what they spend THIER hard earned money on is such a pet peeve of mine. It\u2019s like the ant and the grasshopper.", "NTA - it was been incredibly generous of you to give as you have in the past. Unfortunately it may have led to an entitlement mindset amongst your family. \nHowever you are not obligated to give as you have and I can appreciate that it must\u2019ve been disappointing to have a milestone birthday go unnoticed. Nobody should be taken for granted or advantage of. \nThe response to this years gift certainly shows a level of entitlement. While I\u2019m sure the disappointed was granted based on how generous you were in past years, the response clear displays the entitlement mindset of your family with no appreciation whatsoever. \nEnjoy your trip!  I hope that your family comes around.", "NTA. They have indeed been acting entitled and taking you for granted. I think those are AH moves. Instead of showing gratitude for what they get, they expect their gifts to be on the same level every year. What would happen if, God forbid, you hit hard times along the way? Would they step in and pick up the slack? Judging by this year's reaction they would not. I shouldn't go back to giving them lavish presents if I were you. 50$ is still a pretty decent gift. OK it doesn't compare to a laptop or a PS5, but then again it is beyond greedy to expect that level of gifts every year.", "NTA.\n\nThis is always going to be the problem with some people: you give them terrific gifts and then they expect it as their due.  You are young and should be able to use your money for your enjoyment.  Next year, 25$ gift certificates for anyone who complained.  Maybe hand-make a gift for SIL.", "NTA at all. I give gifts, people like them or they don't. If they say I got them a shit gift it'd be the last gift I ever got them.  The whole lot of them can just stuff it. I'd be looking to get the gift cards back too...", "NTA - dude, gotta take care of yourself first. I would be grateful for any gift, big or small. Your family is blessed to have you take care of them. Now, again, take care of yourself and the gf.", "Nta but they are for taking you for granted and being rude about your gifts.", "NTA, they are definitely assholes. After something like that I sure wouldn't want to give them gifts ever again, not even talk to them.", "NTA, and yes, they are acting entitled and have took you for granted.\n\nIt's time for a reality check for them.\n\nI'd send out a mass text reminding them exactly of what you have done for them, and how they couldn't bother doing anything even small for your birthday. You should have found out what they got you for xmas...I'm sure they'll try and say they got you something really good, but know that is highly unlikely.\n\nThen block them and enjoy your vacation.", "NTA.  If they are so offended, offer to take back their gifts", "NTA...they're taking your past generosity for granted. They very much are being AH. Use your money to enjoy your life and feel no guilt.", "NTA \u2026 that\u2019d be the last gifts any of them got from me", "NTA, but your relatives certainly are. \n\nI think that movie gift cards are perfectly fine gifts to give people for Christmas.", "NTA\u2026your family should appreciate what you have done for them, not expect it.  They should also consider the fact that maybe, just maybe, you would like to use your bonus for yourself as well, because you are the one that earned it and worked for it.  You might have to consider how you want to handle this is the future, because one, you never know when a bonus will stop.  Two, you will have a family if your own one day to consider.", "NTA, they don't care about you, they care about what you give them! They did nothing for your 30th!

Enjoy your holiday and spend spend spend on yourself..", "For shame! You're spending money -- that you worked hard to earn -- on yourself instead of using it to support them in the manner to which they have been accustomed! How dare you! How greedy of you!\n\nThat, just in case it's not crystal clear, was sarcasm. You sir, are NTA.", "NTA. YOUR FAMILY HAS SHOWN YOU THAT YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT ABOUT THEM. ENTITLED", "NTA. They are entitled and taking your generosity for granted. Their attitudes in response to this just proves the case IMO.", "NTA\nYou kind of set the precedent for expensive gifts but youe family still aren't entitled to them. And the fact they did nothing for your birthday shows they have expectations of you that they simply don't have of themselves. Enjoy the holiday and your  vacation. You might feel it's worth speaking to them about this in the new Year but don't expect any apologies from them,  it sounds like they don't have much respect for you.", "NTA", "NTA. While I think a giftcard is definitly not a great gift (so unpersonnal), they are acting entitled and it's a real AH behaviour.\nEnjoy your trip!", "NTA.  You sound like a great guy.  But does your family know that your change of heart comes from their lack of effort to acknowledge your birthday?  If you haven't specifically told them then you should.", "Look, you're NTA for wanting some me-time with your bonus. Sounds like you've been more than generous over the years. Maybe your fam didn't get the memo that it's not all about the price tag. A chill convo after your vacay might clear the air. Enjoy your trip and sort it later!", "Nta. Fuck all of that noise", "NTA", "NTA. Have fun on vactiom.", "NTA! You sound so genuinely caring about your family and it shows that you are thinking of them. Love that for you!

So he would do this for us, parents and/or our kids here and there. It was always totally appreciated when he did, but NO expectation of it at all. And we\u2019ve totally supported him as he\u2019s advanced in his career and made sure some of us are always at his graduations (he was military in a unique role) and achievement ceremonies. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re being treated the way you are. That\u2019s horrible! I\u2019d rather have no gifts and have the close relationship I have with my brother hands down!", "Personally I would be livid with this reaction.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to be calm here, tell them that you have been more than generous in the past and this reaction and behaviour has disappointed you massively and makes you feel like they see you as a paycheck. \n\nI would then block them for a good while and let that sink in.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Question \u2753 what do they get you for Christmas?\n\nAnd FWIW, it sounds like you should evaluate how much you have given them over the years and how much overall they have done for you. Does your birthday pass often with no acknowledgement? \nAre you made to feel that you have to share your success?\n\nMaybe write them a letter explaining how you feel and the 50 is now status quo going forward, take it or leave it. And stop spending \ud83d\udcb0 and time on them if they act this way.", "Nta- they are absolutely being entitled. Block them all and have a fabulous trip with your gf!", "NTA. History is irrelevant but it makes u even less of an AH. Nobody is entitled to your money, even your family. You've been extremely generous with them, it doesn't make them any more entitled to your money. Even if they were short in money, they can still show they cared in other ways. Regardless, they are not entitled to your money, and you still gave them something. Have a nice vacation!", "NTA $50 is a very reasonable price to spend on a gift. They are definitely entitled AHs.", "NTA, but you should have brought up your disappointment on your birthday. They may have no idea that you were unhappy.", "Nta, and the yes the relatives are aholes, no beating the bush around that. OP decides how he wants to spend his money. The festival is about family and not the gifts and the gifts are supposed to be reciprocal maybe not in value but in thought but the family makes it about the gifts\ud83e\udd26There is a pattern in OP spending money on the people he loves in that he is doing the same for his GF as well.", "NTA it\u2019s your money that you earned OP. You don\u2019t owe any of them anything and deserve to treat yourself. The fact that your are constantly buying them gifts while they do nothing in return shows you the entitlement right there. Cut the gifts out for good or continue to get them cheap gifts as if you fell on hard times do you think any of them would help you? You\u2019re a cash cow and are enabling their behaviour.", "Nta. You earn your money and nobody but you is entitled to it.", "NTA\n\nOP was being the most thoughtful member of the family and they 100% took advantage of that\nMaybe they will respect your generosity more when they stop receiving it\nEnjoy your holiday and congratulations on finding a partner to do fun things with, that's how great relationships start", "I might be bias as I'm in a similar situation. I work hard to take care of or help the people in my life. But I'm going to San Juan next month and decided to withhold any shopping for Christmas.\n\nPeople are still getting gifts. It'll just be later.", "NTA\n\nso they got consoles last year and this year is a downgrade to some movies ?\n\nyou are being taken for granted and they are the assholes for expecting mega cash to be spent on them, assume that their presents to you are much less ?\n\nin my family, we can all afford to buy what we want, so xmas is small things to unwrap, eat, drink etc", "NTA Looks like you've got their number.

I get it I come from immigrant family as well and they are some of the most opportunistic, greedy people I know. Live your own life, get in the habit now before you get married and have kids so boundaries can be set before having to bring other people into that mess.", "So I may face downvotes, but - good for you! NTA for sure.\n\nWhat piqued my reading was that you said you\u2019re an immigrant. Based on your writing, it seems to me that perhaps your family is one of those where failure is seen as an individual problem, but success is seen as a shared luck. At least that\u2019s what my impression was and I know that to be a factor in many countries and cultures where a more successful sibling or a cousin is not just welcomed, but strongly expected to subsidise the lives of their less to have family members. Essentially - what\u2019s their money, is the family\u2019s money and you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t help out or significantly don\u2019t share your wealth and finances. \n\nFor once, you put yourself first and that\u2019s a good thing, in my opinion. I think you should let your family know that unless they appreciate the gift this year, they will get nothing starting from next year and every year after that.", "NTA - but if you generally gave gifts costing $500 and up, you might have wanted to let everyone know that you'd decided to change that in advance.", "NTA.  Your family does seem to be entitled to your money.  Time to step back and reassess at what point they decided you were to fill the financial gap for them and their family.  Prioritize yourself as clearly they will never take care of you.", "Yeh I think communication could have helped the whole way through. Immediately after his bday express disappointment. Then pre Christmas give a heads up that given you have such a big trip you will be doing more modest Christmas gifts. $50 is still a generous gift for a sibling - assuming they aren\u2019t spending hundreds on you."]}
