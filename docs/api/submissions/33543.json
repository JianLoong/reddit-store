I hope to have a family some day but for right now I'm just dating and saving money. \n\nFor the last few years I've been using my Christmas bonus to buy my parents, siblings, and siblings cool Christmas gifts. I am lucky enough to be earning much more than I need and I have an excellent nest egg going for when I'm ready. My parents and my siblings aren't there. My folks were immigrants and while they own their home and, as far as I know, are debt free, they do not have a huge retirement account. My older brother and sister each decided independently to start their families while they were quite young in my opinion. \n\nSo anyway like I said I have been blowing my bonus on all of them for the last while. I paid for my parents to visit their home country. I bought both of my siblings families a PS5 when they were hard to get. My nephew started university this fall. I got him a new laptop last Christmas as a graduation/Christmas present. \n\nI do not resent spending this money. I love my family. And I do not expect them to reciprocate, I already buy myself whatever I want. However I noticed something this year. It was my thirtieth birthday and none of them did anything for me. \n\nSo I asked my girlfriend of she wanted to go to Asia for New Years. She is a student so I am paying for everything. We are seeing our families for Christmas and leaving on Boxing Day. \n\nI got to my parents yesterday afternoon and put my gifts for everyone under the tree. I got everyone a $50 gift card for the movies. There are twelve of them so that's still $600. \n\nMy SIL decided to sneak a peak at her gift. She thought I was snubbing her so she told everyone that I got her a shit gift. \n\nHuge fight. I just left and went back to my hotel. Calls and texts nonstop. I was being greedy, immature, callous, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I just blocked them. I can spend the next few days as a tourist in my home town and then leave. I told my girlfriend what happened with my family and she has my back. \n\nI think they are acting entitled and taking me for granted.

They are absolutely taking you for granted. They didn\u2019t have to spend money on you but to not arrange a nice birthday dinner at someone\u2019s home or SOMETHING when you do so much for them is bonkers disrespectful and entitled. \n\nIf you hope to salvage some relationship with them I do think you should tell them exactly why you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to get them huge presents anymore. For one thing it\u2019s not your job to do that. It\u2019s nice of you that you do but it\u2019s not something I think is appropriate. It does lead to expectations that you\u2019ll have to break when you have a family of your own anyways.\n\nYou should tell them you were disappointed when they didn\u2019t even come over on your bday. That it\u2019s not about money but you feel like your just a money bag to your family and you don\u2019t want to just be that to them so you\u2019ve decided to change the dynamic and from now on you\u2019ll still give gifts but more reasonable, normal sized gifts. You want to be someone important to them and not just a check. \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t go well go NC for a while. You don\u2019t need people in your life that just view you as a source of money.\n\nEdit: that I don\u2019t think you NEED to tell them why the change in gifts. It\u2019s probably necessary though if you want to move forward with your relationship with them. My vote is to go NC for a while and find your own family who appreciates you. If they ask why tell them.", "NTA - what a horrible response! They ARE being AHs & you have a right to reproach them & ask them why they would treat you like that if they actually love you. That is NOT how family should treat each other. I would skip your family festivities this year & let them know you expect an apology from them.

Nobody should be taken for granted or advantage of. \nThe response to this years gift certainly shows a level of entitlement. While I\u2019m sure the disappointed was granted based on how generous you were in past years, the response clear displays the entitlement mindset of your family with no appreciation whatsoever. \nEnjoy your trip!  I hope that your family comes around.", "NTA. They have indeed been acting entitled and taking you for granted. I think those are AH moves. Instead of showing gratitude for what they get, they expect their gifts to be on the same level every year. What would happen if, God forbid, you hit hard times along the way? Would they step in and pick up the slack? Judging by this year's reaction they would not. I shouldn't go back to giving them lavish presents if I were you. 50$ is still a pretty decent gift. OK it doesn't compare to a laptop or a PS5, but then again it is beyond greedy to expect that level of gifts every year.", "NTA.\n\nThis is always going to be the problem with some people: you give them terrific gifts and then they expect it as their due.

NTA for sure.\n\nWhat piqued my reading was that you said you\u2019re an immigrant.

At least that\u2019s what my impression was and I know that to be a factor in many countries and cultures where a more successful sibling or a cousin is not just welcomed, but strongly expected to subsidise the lives of their less to have family members.

AND  come to a new understanding that ~$50/person (or $20, or whatever you guys can agree on) is the new expected gift exchange value between all parties (*including them to you*), and anything you (or they) ever decide to gift *above* that is of course purely voluntary and should *not* be expected.  \n\nAnd sure, that\u2019s the kind of thing that *should* go without saying.

Why must op validate his spending or lack of. No. They are owed nothing.", "OP should just tell them to give the gift cards back if they don't want them. No need for OP to fall over themselves so solve a problem they didn't make. The apology needs to come from everyone else.", "I\u2019m not sure I agree with you guys.  I see your point.  But gift giving shouldn\u2019t come with expectations from the recipient.  Regardless of past gifts.\n\nIf OP chose to get them nothing this year only then would I possibly say hey guys things are changing this year and I would prefer we don\u2019t exchange gifts.\n\nBut to have to go and acknowledge I\u2019m not spending hundreds of dollars on you this year, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\n\nIt\u2019s a gift he is giving, not a bill he is paying.", "He really doesn\u2019t. The fact that his gift giving has created such an expectation is not his problem. I would be so embarrassed to pull something like this.

The problem with people is they think people who have money don't need anything, so they don't give them any gifts. What they fail to understand is that people with money still want to be remembered. It's the thought. \n\nAnyway, whenever I feel like people are feeling entitled to my money, I pull back. That works to bring the entitlement into check.", "NTA but your family is. Definitely entitled. You did nothing wrong. Enjoy your trip!", "NTA for spending the money on yourself. But you are for setting a precedent of extravagant gifts and then not communicating to them that you were changing what you do and why. Also, getting everyone the same gift card is kind of shitty. You could have at least gotten them gift cards that are tailored to where they shop or what their interests are. \n\nAlso, stop judging your siblings for having kids when they did.

Take care of you and your gf and go have a nice vacation.", "NTA I'm the single and big present person in my family. And NEVER would anyone say anything like this. This just shows you that you are not a valuable family member, just an ATM.

It's not hard to be thoughtful for family.", "NTA.\n\nYou still spent plenty on each and every one of them. They are being greedy af.

I get that you love your family, but - yes, they have become entitled, and they really are taking you for granted. More than that, they are so entrenched in their entitlement that instead of acknowledging and being embarrassed/regretful at their mistake, they got angry and were rude to you... for spending any money on yourself instead of them.\n\nwow.\n\nYou can still love them, but it's time to retrain them. Tell them you realize you made a mistake and don't want them to see you as an ATM or Santa Claus. You want them to see and care about and relate to you... for you. The lop-sided giving changed how they view you. You are going to return to being on par with the family giving.\n\nThen let each of them relate to you on their own terms. It gives you a chance to see each of your relatives for themselves. Some of them will recognize their greed and be ready to refocus on reconnecting with you, their loved one. Others will still show their greed. (I have to say that I think the SIL is a prime candidate for being in the greedy camp.)\n\nIt's not like you'll be depriving them of anything they need, just things that they would like but not normally afford. Given that you do save your money, you can choose to help someone out when there is a real need - if you want. You can also decide to only up the gift level for special events/or special birthdays... or you can wait to see a restoration of the relationships and decide to slightly up the level of gifts in general. You get the idea.", "You are not technically the AH, that honor belongs to your SIL who just couldn't resist behaving like a 5-year-old and peaking at the gift.  However, for several years you have been very generous and unfortunately, when you show such generosity to some people, they begin to not only expect it going forward, but feel entitled to it, as you found out.  \n\nI'd send them all a text or email simply saying \"I realized none of you even bothered to wish me happy birthday this year.  Since my special moments mean nothing to you, I don't feel any need to give you lavish gifts.\"  Just that, nothing more.  Let them compare notes and figure it out.", "They are acting super entitled and are acting like assholes. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your relatives have become a little too accustomed to your extravagant gifts.\n\nThe only thing that I see that might explain their perspective is you saying that your parents are immigrants. If by chance they are from a culture that expects you to give money back to the family, that might explain why they expected more. That wouldn't excuse their behavior but it might help you see their side of things. Although I am not sure I believe that myself. Especially since it was your SIL who started the fight. Either way, you're not the a-hole.", "NTA, because it's YOUR money. You can spend it how you like and it's nobody else's business.\n\nYou family has gotten way too used to using you as an ATM, and as for you thinking they're not AH's?

They ignored your birthday and then get mad that you\u2019re Christmas gifts weren\u2019t as big as in years past!  Nah.

Even if they couldn't afford to give you expensive gifts for your birthday they could have given you care, thought and attention.

You should be thankful for whatever gift you receive unless inappropriate which a gift certificate was not...had it been for exclusively a porno cinema for example it would have been. \n\nI think you have got the measure of your extended family.

A gift is freely given and should be fully appreciated, regardless of the size or how much money was spent in it.  Frankly, my favorite gifts I\u2019ve received were homemade.

Go enjoy yourself and your hard earned money how you want to, and give them time to cool it.

You don\u2019t have to buy anyone anything for Christmas. Your family sounds entitled. \n\nI stopped gift exchanges years ago. I don\u2019t buy anyone any gifts and I do not accept gifts from others.

They are definitely acting entitled and taking you for granted.\n\nYou got them a lovely experience gift.\n\nI think you should have been careful previously by spoiling them too much. It's fine to sporadically treat people, but you set that expectation every year for a big flash present and now you're paying the price because they took you for granted.", "Yea this sounds familiar. I\u2019m sorry you also have an entitled self centered family. Going NC is HARD and lonely. Now you have a significant other supporting you so that helps. But it\u2019s a lonely experience overall. If you think you want to keep a relationship going with them I would suggest a conversation with them, explain (not the gifts) but how you feel about their lack of respect and celebrating you. It hurts and sucks to be the one to give and give then be snubbed constantly. And you don\u2019t see yourself going back to the overly generous gift giving and if that\u2019s not okay then you will walk away (assuming you will, not a time for bluffing).

My wife and I are both no contact with are father's, and minimal contact with most of the rest of our families. I fully support him going no contact if that's what he wants.
