Go to the appropriate student office and report that a lecturer is denying you the accommodations required for your disability that have been approved by the university.", "I\u2019m a university professor.

We are told that if a student sues for not getting their legal accommodations, it is us, specifically, who are sued, and it will be us who are liable. \n\nSome accommodations you can discuss and change and modify.  Where a student has to sit to be able to see or to hear is just\u2026NOT.\n\nTalk to the people in charge of disability accommodations at your school.  You might also want to talk to the chair of the department and your main professor.\n\nYOU ARE NOT BEING AN ASSHOLE (NTA).  You are caring for your education.

The college needs to know the behavior of one of its teachers. This teacher is obviously not an expert on brain injury or vision, and definitely doesn't care that he is legally required to accommodate you. \n\nHe is a liability to the school, and if he is a graduate student with teaching being a requirement for his own degree, his mentor needs to know about this.", "NTA.\n\n\"He told me that if I sat in the back there\u2019s no way I was paying attention and he wouldn\u2019t allow me to be \u201cirresponsible with my education.\u201d \n\nThis is a teacher who needs to retire early.  Are you paying for your education?  If so, then it's not the teacher's business if you are being responsible or not.  If it turns out your assignments and test scores reflect irresponsible behavior, then he can simply fail you or give you lower marks.  Trying to dictate your study habits with no evidence that your study habits are below par is a true AH move.", "NTA but DO report that guest teacher. You told them you needed an accomodation and that you can't sit close, and why. AT THE LEAST the teacher should have accepted it and checked it later, unless it was immediately disruptive to the class. It wasn't, teacher was TA. We teachers are WELL aware that some students need physical accomodations. The guest teacher could have simply left a note for the regular teacher, who could have then chewed you out if you were lying. Nope. TOTALLY unacceptable behavior by the guest teacher, informed or not, please PLEASE tell the college program ASAP.", "NTA and I'd report that teacher to the principle for not listening", "NTA.

Why are people that dumb and disrespectful still allowed to teach anyone?", "Aw hell no. This is raising my mama bear hackles. This absolutely, 100% needs to be reported.

This seems odd to me.", "Go to you accommodations  adviser. Email him and cc your registar. That's not fine. It's discrimination. They will respond and take care of the matter.

I think the issue is we\u2019re on the study abroad and the guest teachers aren\u2019t through our school specifically, it\u2019s people at the university were staying at and people my main teacher has set us up with.
