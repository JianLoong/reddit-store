{"id": 31461, "submission_id": "180yw6x", "title": "AITA for not having my brother and SIL\u2019s baby room set up by the time they arrived and ruining Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "So this situation, in my opinion, is ridiculous so parents please chime in. My brother (36) and his wife (34) and myself (34) are all visiting my moms house for Thanksgiving and being the new parents of their 1 year 3 month old first baby they are quite \u201cparentzillas\u201d in my opinion (fyi I don\u2019t have any kids). \n\nRecently they had all these stringent requests such as having a baby gate but it needs to be the drill in not the pressure ones (even though the stairway has a door with a lock on it so stairs are not accessible), blackout shades for the room the crib is in, and even agreed to let my mom sleep on the couch so that they could be closer to the baby and in exchange my mom would sleep on the couch for the duration of the stay.\n\nFast forward to today. The blackout shades take 5 minutes to set up and while I had agreed to do it 3 months ago I told them it made no sense to do it so far in advance since we prefer sunlight in the room and we could set it up instantly when they arrive. Unfortunately I exited work late and in combination with traffic I arrived exactly 45 minutes after they had arrived. \n\nThey were furious. \n\nThey swore to never come back again if we delayed the baby\u2019s sleep by 45 minutes to an hour. They claim that the baby \u201cis going to suffer because I am unreliable\u201d and the shades had not been set up before they arrived. They are now deciding to leave first thing in the morning. Keep in mind this is a simple setup, a literal bath rod and blackout shades and then putting that in the window. Everything was purchased it just had to go on the window. \n\nSome background info: they drove about 7 hours with traffic so I get they are tired and exhausted and the baby was probably crying so they were on edge. Also we promised to have it ready but it was not done in time. \n\nAlso I\u2019m kind of ticked off because of the following: 1) my brothers dog was having an allergic reaction so I fronted my brother the money ($400) no questions asked and no repayment requested 2) just recently I travelled to Boston to scope out apartments and neighborhoods on their behalf since they are moving there soon but live too far to travel and they have a baby ($2000) 3) my mom supported him and his wife prior to them having a baby and let them both live rent free for an extended period of time in her house to help them save money. I feel they are entitled and spoiled and should not be acting this way.\n\nI\u2019m also upset because my sister in law was telling my mom how it was unfair how everything wasn\u2019t set up prior to their arrival even though we said it would be.  I think it\u2019s unreasonable because moving the crib up a set of stairs is impossible for my mom as she\u2019s older and everything could have been resolved with putting up blackout shades in 5 minutes where the crib currently is and everything else in the morning.\n\nDoes 1 hour difference in sleep schedule truly make a child/baby suffer?", "created_utc": 1700621219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180yw6x/aita_for_not_having_my_brother_and_sils_baby_room/", "score": 673, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have kids (11 years and 5 years). If this has been me I would have brought my own black out shades and baby gate. If you had the stuff ready for the curtains the parents could have hung them themselves and then the child could have gone to bed when they wanted them to. And did they want your Mom on the couch so they could sleep in her bed which is closer to the baby? That's just silly. Bring a baby monitor. Sleep on the floor by the crib. Or....like many people....just get out of bed from wherever it is to go to your baby when they wake up. A minute of crying won't hurt the baby. they sound like entitled brats. Perhaps they should A.) stay at a hotel next year or B.) start hosting Thanksgiving from their own home for everyone. Throwing a fit and causing a ruckus around a holiday because your unreasonable demands weren't met is absolutely tacky. You are NTA.", "As a mom of 3, you are NOT the asshole.\nYour brother and SIL seem like they are doing to much, as the parents they are ultimately responsible for these unreasonable requests. If I\u2019m being honest, they should be teaching their baby to sleep anywhere, requesting all these changes is not practical. \nWith that being said, if you were busy, you were busy, just don\u2019t make promises to do things that you may not get to. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not that serious for them to be throwing a fit over. If that\u2019s their biggest problem, they are doing pretty good lol", "NTA. This is ridiculous. It shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility to provide their \u201cnecessities\u201d for their child. The gate and blackout shades are both things that could fit in their vehicle and they could bring themselves. They seem pretty helpless, TBH.\nWhenever I traveled with my kids when they were babies, I brought a pack and play, bottle warmer, and all other necessities with. My parents had safety gates because they had dogs and other grandchildren that lived nearby, but if they didn\u2019t, I certainly would have brought those as well.\n\nNext time, just a suggestion, don\u2019t agree to cater to them if it\u2019s something they should be doing themselves.", "Yeah, yeah, you agreed to do it ahead of time. Stuff happens and gets in the way and you don't even live there. Not that your mom should have done it - nor should she be sleeping on a couch. Your brother and SIL sound awful. Who is putting their one year old in a room with blackout curtains? Unless there's an actual medical problem (sensory, light sensitivity, etc diagnosed by a medical professional) not necessary. You do describe them as parentzillas. I see why. They could have put up the curtains - one person holds the baby, the other puts up the curtains. And even if the baby is an hour beyond nap time, they'll survive. May not be fun for a few hours, but babies are more resilient than people think. They adapt. I do have kids, and grandkids. If any of my children behaved the way brother/sil have, they could go ahead and leave. Bye. \n\nI think you made a mistake - that does NOT make you the A-hole. Brother and SIL on the other hands, are massive A-holes. It's not all about them and the toddler no matter what they think. Good luck.", "NTA. What if\u2026wild idea, the entitled parents do it themselves?", " In the 45 minutes that they were waiting for you to get home from work they could have hung the damn shades themselves. But I'm still trying to understand that they expected you to drill through your doorway for a temporary baby gate for a set of stairs that already had a door. And you did it. I'm going to assume that you own your apartment or at least got permission from your landlord??? \n\nNTA especially in light of all you've helped then with already.", "NTA. And everyone who is saying that the OP had to install the shades earlier: he is visiting their parents house just like the brother. \nAlso why did the brother install it by himself: is he disabled? He had 45 minutes to do that but he decided to complain.\nAnyway, all these extra requests are ridiculous: I wonder how mankind survived before the blackout shades were invented.", "Nta. So ridiculous!", "NTA, and speaking as a parent, they are going to seriously regret insisting on blackout curtains and (I'll bet) total silence and otherwise perfect conditions for Baby's naps, because there will be times they can't get those conditions and still desperately need Baby to nap. \n\nMy kid used to take a lot of naps in the stroller being pushed around a well-lit and bustling mall (after she was old enough to have her vaccinations, of course). Also in the car with her Dad's music playing (he likes prog rock and heavy metal). She could sleep ANYWHERE if she was tired. (Mind you, moving vehicles helped.)", "They lost me when they \"agreed to let your Mother sleep on the couch\"   the mother that you have mentioned is not young.  \n\nPutting up the shades at least a few days before wouldn't have killed you to lose a  bit of sunlight in that room.", "NTA. This is entirely ridiculous. Mom of 3 here. Never in their entire life did I expect homes I visited to be baby-proofed or otherwise adjusted to me or my children. I'd sleep on the floor before even thinking about making the homeowner sleep on the couch. In fact, we just got a hotel room. \n\nDriving 7 hours to throw a hissy fit and drive home the next day? I'd tell them, \"Okay. More pie for me.\"", "NTA - They can do all that shit on their own. \n\nDrop the rope and stop doing anything for them.", "NTA.  \n\nIt must be really interesting being related to royalty, however. It's too bad the King, the Queen and the little prince couldn't stay longer due to the staff's mistakes.", "NTA...\n\nWhy are you supplying/installing these things to begin with. It's their kid. They should have a travel blackout blind & travel crib if they intend to be travelling with them. Their kid, their responsibility! \n\nI use a \"travel\" blackout blind in my bedroom. It uses magnets to attach (either to the window frame, if it's magnetic, or little stick on discs that were supplied with it). \n\nI take it with me when I travel, as I find it let's me sleep better, it takes maybe 30 seconds to install. \n\nOr others use heavy duty suction cups.\n\nThe baby gate is just a ridiculous request given the door.", "We are good without them moving back to Boston. Thanks anyways.", "NTA, this is ridiculous.", "NTA. They are being ridiculous. And no, losing an hour of sleep is not going to hurt a baby.", "They are \"letting\" your mom sleep on the couch? Letting? Letting her sleep on the COUCH? Your mom!????!\n\nThey are absolute spoilt brats.", "NTA.  If you have tiny children and you travel, it will NEVER be the exact same setup you have at home and sometimes you just have to roll with it.  Yes they are parentzillas. I have been traveled with babies and it was always an adjustment each time and it\u2019s never \u201cperfectly and it is what it is.  They (and you) cannot control every variable.  They came in a car? They should have brought every single thing they think they have to have", "Info\n\n\n\nHow are they taking care of a baby without the use of their  hands?\n\n\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, they are definitely parentzillas.", "NTA. They are ridiculous. When my kids were little and we traveled they slept in a pack and play in the nearest semi-quiet room.  We also weren\u2019t super scheduled and didn\u2019t have much in the way of routine.  By the time they were a year old they were used to sleeping just about anywhere whenever they got tired.", "NTA, this is ridiculous.", "NTA- parentzillas is right! \nYour poor Mom sleeping on the couch. Personally I would let them leave! But that would hurt your Mom.", "NTA they are doing too much \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.  I'm a mom, obvs see my handle. I feel for your nephew / niece too. \n\nThat said you can do NOTHING RIGHT in their eyes because they are that kind of people now.  They sound like exhausting! You can stop catering and pandering to their needs.", "NTA. I'd be asking for reimbursement for the money you have spent helping them out. I bet they change their tune quick smart. Don't help them any longer either.", "So they could have easily done it themselves in the time they spent complaining.", "INFO: Do you actually do anything that benefits yourself/ your Mum/both or are you and your Mum the family slaves/ATM? Do you actually have a life outside these spoilt brats you call family? \n\nMy judgement is still NTA btw. I am just curious. I'd look at spending the time they are in town flat out on the couch with your Mum... cos honey, you deserve it!", "I am a parent of toddler and newborn, your brother and sil are extreme. I would be so happy if I get a bed at my in-laws lol we sleep on the couch hahah and have slept on the couch with our toddler. They sound free loaders tbh.", "NTA.  Your brother and sister-in-law are insane.  I have a 4 year old who can sleep anywhere and she\u2019s not the greatest sleeper out there compared to other kids.  Their kid isn\u2019t the second coming of the messiah, despite what they think.   The sooner they work it out the better for everyone one but especially the child who will grow up to be an entitled demanding AH just like its parents.  Probably a good thing they want to go home otherwise it would be a whole weekend of catering to their little ray of sunshine and f$&k anybody else\u2019s comfort or convenience.  I just get sick of people thinking they and their kids are the most important people in the universe and everyone else needs to bend over backwards to accommodate them.  Rant over!", "NTA - not their house, so there should be nothing they are entitled to.", "NTA. i say this as a nanny who\u2019s dealt with sleep schedules and sleep training. your brother and SIL are unhinged, entitled and spoiled.", "You're probably the ahole for not doing it the day before, but honestly, you are the winner here. I have a 9 year old. I did not even know what that shade is, babies can sleep anywhere at any time. They seem to be a nightmare and if I was you, I won't accept any of this over the top nonsense.", "NTA. There's no end to the entitlement of parents.", "NTA. I\u2019m a mom of 3 and you have to teach kids how to sleep anywhere and at any time of day. My oldest is 10 & first grandchild, we never thought of blackout curtains until my sis had her child 2 yrs ago, now they have them. My middle child (3yrs) doesn\u2019t sleep in the car, but is a great napper and over-night sleeper yet my youngest is a horrible napper & overnight sleeper but will sleep no problem in the car anytime anywhere.\nI always brought everything I needed (and still do!) anywhere we go-pack n play/stroller/portable high chair/bottle warmer/diapers, wipes/clothes/food/bottles & formula\u2026you get it. These people are entitled and grandma is enabling. NTA NTA", "NTA. My sister had my nephews on a pretty good sleep routine, so yes, throwing off their schedule for an hour was problematic. For something that takes 5 minutes though? She would do it herself.", "NTA. If your brother and SIL \u201cneeded\u201d all these ridiculous things for their baby then they should\u2019ve #1 bought what they needed with their $, and #2 used their own two hands to get everything ready once they got there. \n\nSo entitled. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not even your house. Why are you even a part of this equation? It\u2019s ridiculous.", "Your brother and SIL are ridiculous! How do they survive in the outside world", "NTA - while yeah it would have been nice to have it set up like you said, it\u2019s not the end of the world. Any normal people would have just done it themselves. They are acting like entitled AH who think the world now revolves around them because they have a kid.", "Ummm what? No, you are NTA they definitely. It\u2019s just plain rude to make demands like that for someone else\u2019s house.", "NTA. Help them carry their bags out and enjoy a nice chill thanksgiving without them around while they drive 7 hours back over a curtain.", "NTA and a 7 hour car ride is going to screw up the sleep schedule far more then a delayed blackout blind. They sound incredibly entitled. The fact they asked your mom to sleep on the couch in her own house tells me how entitled they are. I\u2019m sure these parents of the year have a baby monitor so why do they have to put your mom on the couch just to be closer to the baby? Routine is definitely important for a baby, but they are going to have to learn to go with the flow a bit.", "Nta. My oldest really liked to follow a schedule, but by 15 months old, he was fairly adaptable.", "Yes for some  baby\u2019s/children a slight change In their schedule can be hard \n\nBut they could have set up the blackout curtains themselves and Quit enabling them they have such poor attitudes towards everyone just stop helping so much when they don\u2019t realize the value of time,", "NTA\n\nThey shifted Mom to the couch?? There are currently 8 billion people on Earth. 100.8 billion people have lived since the beginning of humanity. Their baby isn't special, and her biological function of producing said baby is even less so. They can get tf out of Mom's bed and do their own baby proofing. \n\n>Does 1 hour difference in sleep schedule truly make a child/baby suffer?\n\nNo, but it can make all the adults suffer until it finally sleeps. It's not a big deal and just part of traveling. \n\nStop indulging their delusions because you're (collectively speaking) just making them even worse nightmares than they already are.", "NTA. They are having a tantrum along with their baby. Give them a pacifier.", "They couldn't put up a curtain rod? Wow.\nNta", "NTA\n\nBut please, stop doing anything for these entitled jerks.

Good riddance if they leave ASAP. You are NTA", "So for them to honor you with their presence, you had to put holes in the walls, hang curtains, get a crib and make mom sleep on the couch? Is anyone here wondering why everyone had to bend over backwards for these people? Have they heard of a pack and play? Do they not have the ability to problem solve or adjust to new circumstances?  Are the lack of blackout curtains a good enough reason to make your elderly mom feel like she failed as a grandmother and threaten to leave?\n\nNTA, and you are right, they are acting spoiled and entitled. I feel for you OP.", "NTA.\n\nThey could have set it u themselves in the time they spent arguing", "NTA. It must be difficult to be related to royalty, lol.

One of them could have put them up if they really needed them.", "If the baby is that tired, he/she will fall asleep regardless of blackout shades. Besides, they can install them themselves! Give mom back her bed, you entitled AH'S! Ruining an entire holiday over this? You'll be much happier without these clods!", "NTA and you are very much dealing with parentzillas and should stop catering to them.\n\nThey are not doing their kid any favors by imposing such draconian measures for sleep. My kids learned how to sleep through anything as we lived on a busy street that had cars, buses, fire trucks, ambulances, etc going by at all hours of the day. Made life so much easier when we had to go new places as I never had to worry about getting them to sleep. \n\nAnd why on earth are you doing the footwork for their move?

So this kid took a nap in the car. Without blackout blinds. If they travel and expect to stay in another place, there will be things that aren\u2019t perfect for this toddler. It\u2019s a good idea for them to get experience with managing the kid\u2019s schedule in non perfect conditions. \n\nSure you could have put the blinds up the night before they arrived.

You had 89 days, 23 hours and 55 minutes to do it and you didn't. Don't leave things until the last minute. They are being a bit OTT but they just drove 7 hours with a one year old and you couldn't manage a 5 minute job.\n\nAsking your mother to sleep on the floor is an AH move from them and they really need to learn that whilst their world revolves around the child, nobody else's does. However she agreed, more fool her.\n\nLet them leave...", "NTA. They\u2019re in for a rude awakening as that baby grows.

Save yourself the heartburn and the migraine and get a hotel room and escape this bs.", "Soft YTA because you did agree to have this done by a certain time and didn\u2019t. I get your thought process but still, you fumbled the ball. But it sounds to me like they\u2019re just tired and stressed from a 7-hour trip with their toddler and they probably just wanted to seamlessly transition from car to crib so the baby wouldn\u2019t be fussy and they could relax as well, and they just flipped when they couldn\u2019t do that. By tomorrow morning when everyone\u2019s had some sleep I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll prefer to stay than waste their trip. Put them up now and tomorrow just apologize and say you misunderstood the importance of the curtains but they\u2019re up now.", "A weird ESH.\n\nYou agreed to have it ready, so it should have been ready. Other than that, I am on your side.\n\nYour brother and SIL are absolutely insufferable. They should be kissing your and your mums ass for making their lives so easy when they come to stay. I have never asked anyone to make changes when we stayed somewhere with our daughter. We worked with what was set up and that was that. No adding curtains and making better room for us etc. \n\nReally though, have some solice in the fact they're only going to make their lives harder as LO gets older. They will get their LO so accustomed to full darkness etc it will make it hard for them to travel and actually have LO sleep. We did whatever and our daughter is 6 now and will sleep anywhere. Makes life so much easier.", "NTA and that baby probably slept most of the 7 hours in the car. That's what 1 year olds do in the car. Any other adult in that house could have done it.\n\nThat being said. You said you'd do it. You should have done it that morning before going to work.", "Info: Who finally ended up setting up the blinds? Did the parents have it done before you got there?

If you didn\u2019t want to accommodate their requests, just say no and let your mother and them figure it out. 45 minutes late for bedtime can be a big deal for a baby and I could see them being worn thin after a long drive. But one of them or your mom could have stepped up and installed the blinds.", "YTA.  You are full of excuses, but the reality is that you promised 3 months ago to have a five-minute task done before they arrived, and then failed to do it.

You could have hung them last week and just.... Kept the curtains open.", "YTA you said you'd have it done by the time they got there, and you didn't. Most of what you wrote is extra information that just disguises the very simple facts of the story.", "Soft YTa. Only because this reminds me of the Thanksgiving we traveled to my in-laws. They already had a crib and supplies. We got there late, I was exhausted and to my dismay, when I took my sleeping daughter to the room, the crib was there\u2014and a pile of toys and linemen\u2019s in it! My in-laws knew for months we were coming and never bothered to take anything out of the crib or put in sheets. Apparently they never entered the room to make sure it was set up. \n\nYes, I fixed it. Yes, it took me 5-10 minutes. But just the general stress of being a first time mom and keeping up with the details, it REALLY sucked that I still had to be the one to fix things. No, I didn\u2019t tell them and they never knew I had to set up baby\u2019s bed.", "YTA. I totally understand that from a non-parent perspective it could seem ridiculous to ask, but some babies are particular and maybe their kid does not sleep in cars so they needed a nap as soon as they got there and they couldn\u2019t sleep in such a light filled place. You don\u2019t know hell until you\u2019ve delt with an overtired baby- they don\u2019t fall asleep easier, it\u2019s actually harder to get them down. Their body releases cortisol and adrenaline when it gets too tired and that makes it even harder to sleep and then you\u2019re in this terrible cycle. So yes, an hour can absolutely matter.\n\nBut aside from that- someone drove 7 hours with probably screaming kids in the car and a 5 minute task they asked to be done 3 months ago wasn\u2019t done. Ya. I\u2019d be annoyed too. Not enough to ruin thanksgiving and leave, but enough to be pissy for an evening.", "YTA. Yes, one hour can make a big difference. And not just for the kid, but think of the parents who have to deal with an overtired toddler that cannot reason or understand the fact that they have to wait.\n\nAlso, you could have installed the shades yesterday? Sunday? I get the desire for sunlight but can\u2019t you just\u2026\u2026.lift the shades?", "ESH apart from your mum\n\nThey are entitled parents with a toddler and can't do a 5 min job. (However, I do believe a 7hr journey with a toddler is excusable for being a bit groggy)\n\nYou couldn't do a job that took 5 months because....you didn't want to prep too soon? What about the weekend before, night before, before you went to work? Some parents have a hard tome getting children to sleep, and routine helps. A 7 hr car ride is horrid for anyone. They probably wanted to put baby to sleep, and rest themselves.\n\nEdit: I forgot they asked your mum to sleep on the coach, that is an AH move, especially it being her house and she is old. They can sleep on a floor and use a baby monitor.", "ESH\n\nYou said you do it and 3 months later you had yet to do something that takes 5 minutes?  And then you didn't even get it done before they arrived because you ran late.  3 months and 1 hour late.\n\nThat said they too seem as spoiled and bratty as you.  So Mom did a great job raising y'all.", "ESH. You had time to set it up in advance, you didn\u2019t. And yeah, an hour can make a huge difference (at least to my kid, and the moms I know that had sleep schedules for their babe). It may not seem like much, but it can throw off the whole day or night sleep. Esp on a stressful travel day. And I always found it annoying as a new mom when ppl would critique my fairly structured sleep schedule, yet they weren\u2019t the ones dealing with my kid when things went belly up, I was. HOWEVER, It also sounds like they majorly overreacted, and that you do other things to support them\u2026", "ESH. If you felt it was an unreasonable request, you should have told them no from jump. Orrrrr told them to do it themselves. You said they requested it to be completed 3 months ago. Your brother and SIL are entitled AHs.", "YTA. Baby sleep is not to be fucked with. Missing a nap or going down late for a nap can screw with a baby\u2019s sleep for WEEKS. They just drove 7 hours (and it likely took longer than that as babies have to exit their car seats every 2 hours max) with an infant. Many babies are very particular about their sleep needs- my oldest son had a 5 minute window where he would go to sleep easily and then it would take an hour for him to settle. My youngest on the other hand would sleep any time any where. But you can bet your ass I was a total drill seargent about my oldest\u2019s sleep because if it got messed up I didn\u2019t sleep for weeks afterwards. Do you know what over a year of sleep deprivation does to you?\n\nYou could have put the blinds up before you left for work if it takes 5 minutes. But I\u2019m guessing it didn\u2019t- since baby went down 45 minutes late. \n\nThe gate when there\u2019s a door is a bit over the top, but I can see them being worried about the door being left open. The drill vs pressure thing is a huge safety standard- pressure fit gates have thresholds and are thus tripping hazards at the top of stairs. \n\nYTA YTA YTA. And I don\u2019t blame them for going home because why stay somewhere where their entire routine and thus life is going to be destroyed for well over a month because you promised two minor requests that are actually of HUGE importance?", "You are the asshole. You rpomised to do something and you didnt fucking do it. Shouldve done it the day before. Sure it maye take 5 minutes but these things are always as they seem and could take way longer.

My brother (36) and his wife (34) and myself (34) are all visiting my moms house for Thanksgiving and being the new parents of their 1 year 3 month old first baby they are quite \u201cparentzillas\u201d in my opinion (fyi I don\u2019t have any kids). \n\nRecently they had all these stringent requests such as having a baby gate but it needs to be the drill in not the pressure ones (even though the stairway has a door with a lock on it so stairs are not accessible), blackout shades for the room the crib is in, and even agreed to let my mom sleep on the couch so that they could be closer to the baby and in exchange my mom would sleep on the couch for the duration of the stay.\n\nFast forward to today. The blackout shades take 5 minutes to set up and while I had agreed to do it 3 months ago I told them it made no sense to do it so far in advance since we prefer sunlight in the room and we could set it up instantly when they arrive. Unfortunately I exited work late and in combination with traffic I arrived exactly 45 minutes after they had arrived. \n\nThey were furious. \n\nThey swore to never come back again if we delayed the baby\u2019s sleep by 45 minutes to an hour. They claim that the baby \u201cis going to suffer because I am unreliable\u201d and the shades had not been set up before they arrived. They are now deciding to leave first thing in the morning. Keep in mind this is a simple setup, a literal bath rod and blackout shades and then putting that in the window. Everything was purchased it just had to go on the window. \n\nSome background info: they drove about 7 hours with traffic so I get they are tired and exhausted and the baby was probably crying so they were on edge. Also we promised to have it ready but it was not done in time. \n\nAlso I\u2019m kind of ticked off because of the following: 1) my brothers dog was having an allergic reaction so I fronted my brother the money ($400) no questions asked and no repayment requested 2) just recently I travelled to Boston to scope out apartments and neighborhoods on their behalf since they are moving there soon but live too far to travel and they have a baby ($2000) 3) my mom supported him and his wife prior to them having a baby and let them both live rent free for an extended period of time in her house to help them save money. I feel they are entitled and spoiled and should not be acting this way.\n\nI\u2019m also upset because my sister in law was telling my mom how it was unfair how everything wasn\u2019t set up prior to their arrival even though we said it would be.  I think it\u2019s unreasonable because moving the crib up a set of stairs is impossible for my mom as she\u2019s older and everything could have been resolved with putting up blackout shades in 5 minutes where the crib currently is and everything else in the morning.\n\nDoes 1 hour difference in sleep schedule truly make a child/baby suffer?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Does it suck that their kid couldn't immediately go in the crib, sure, but it's an overreaction to say that Thanksgiving is ruined. \n\nMaybe you could have sent a text to let them know you were running late and hadn't had a chance to set up the room yet...just as a courtesy?

Does it mean you go off on the people who are hosting you and have graciously purchased these items to make your stay easier and more pleasant? Absolutely not. They\u2019re out of their minds! Traveling with kids ALWAYS throws off their schedules and that happened way before the arrived.

I would let them leave and tell them how ungrateful they are. Get your money back OP.", "NTA, but also - of course they're behaving entitled.

It will just make them grumpy for an extra hour.  The fact that you went out and bought the shade for them, allowing them the opportunity to quickly put it up is more than enough. \n\nTheir expectations were too high, you did fine.  I can understand some annoyance coming off a long drive with a most likely screaming toddler in the back if you told them certain things would be done, but none of what you didn't do is honestly a big deal.
