Maybe he was thinking that she (your mom) would just sleep it off.  But that would make him an enabler (not helpful)\n\nTo be clear, you and your brother should not ever live with your mom.

I\u2019m saying this as a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for a year.\n\nYOU NOR YOUR BROTHER ARE THE PROBLEM. Your mom hates herself; not you. Usually I was a happy drunk TBH but sometimes I would turn mean and nasty (not to my kids but to ppl I loved like my husband and my mom and friends). Therapy and sobriety and AA have taught me that I was really just projecting my own pain and trauma onto other ppl - mostly because I hated myself. It was never because I truly disliked the ppl I lashed out at. \n\nI\u2019m truly not trying to downplay what your mom is doing. You are NOT overacting in the least bit. Your safety comes first. But, there is a very high probability that your mom doesn\u2019t mean any of it.

Is it really worse for you when your mother has your worried -is drunk and yells and gets mad at you. I know you're young but you did the right thing honey. You did the best thing for yourself and your sibling. A parent should never make a child worry like that or anxious. A parent should be a kodle of good communication and be patient. It sounds like she isn't doing what is expected of her as a parent and I would look at spending more time with your other parent.

I\u2019ll tell you something that a therapist once told me after I had a rough day with my own parents (my mom seems similar to yours, at least when it comes to the drinking and going off on others). My therapist told me that the actions and reactions of others are a reflection of them, not me, and same in reverse, mine are a reflection of me.

None of this is your fault.", "Yeah this is the thing that bothers me the most, I don't understand how it was just a simple phone call with the father and then going to bed.
