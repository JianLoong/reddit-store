Not for wanting the ring back, but for giving it to him in the first place. Most relationships do not work out. Giving something irreplaceable is a huge mistake. Whether you ever get it back lies in someone else's hands now. Good luck.", "ESH. \n\nYou told him he could keep it then you backtracked on it. \n\nHowever - it might legally be his to keep, but given that he knows the significance, him deciding to keep it might mean he's legally in the clear but he's still an asshole for doing it. \n\nAll in all, I'm afraid you might have just learned a huge and painful lesson on why you shouldn't give treasured family mementos to someone you're not married to (or in a long-term partnership with, at least).", "Nah\n\n\nYou made a huge mistake.  Morally, he should give it back. However, if he doesn't want to or has sold it, there isn't much you can do. \n\n\nYou need to own up to your actions. The mistake is yours to give something so precious, especially for a short-term relationship.", "YTA, but to yourself more than anything. To be blunt, it was silly to give something so sentimental to someone you've only dated for 6 months. You're not the first person to experience such extreme feelings. Try to get it back, but take it as a lesson learned", "Normally I don\u2019t like that people would say you can keep a gift then take that back. This is a different situation in my opinion. That ring is very important to you not for monetary reasons. I don\u2019t think your an asshole for asking for it back. I feel like most people would give it back based on it being a reminder of a relative who passed. That dude is TA and you are NTA.", "YTA, you made the mistake of giving an extremely sentimental gift to someone you've only dated 6 months. But a gift is a gift, that ring is his to do with as he pleases now.", "ESH Why would you give a special ring like that to someone you barely know. Now you're finding out he is an AH and your ring is lost to you. Why would you tell him he could keep it?", "You flippantly gave the ring away and sorry to say your ex is not obligated to give it back. Don't be so stupid with sentimental things. YTA", "NTA\n\nIf he doesn't have time to meet you, he can drop it in a padded envelope and drop it in the mail.  Problem solved.\n\nIt sounds like he's decided not to give you the ring back though.  He's definitely being an AH.\n\nHe asked for your opinion on your relationship with him.  Then he didn't like what you said.  So he's probably holding that ring hostage to \"punish\" you.", "I think I'm going to go with NTA on this (was deciding between that or N A H).  Normally, this would be a gift that you have no right to expect back (you can ask, but can't expect him to give it back).  Given the nature of the history of the ring, I think he's a bit of an AH to not return it.  He has the right to keep it, but that's different than being an AH.    \n\n\nAs for the feedback, NAH.  He asked, you answered.  He doesn't have to like the answer, but if you told him the truth, it is what it is.", "NTA. Generally gifts are for keeps, but given the nature of the gift I think it would be kind of him to return it.", "Soft NTA because you were in a \"serious + intense\" relationship, but it wasn't a wise move for a relationship in the very early stages. Your ex is likely still very hurt over the break-up given his reaction and is most likely to do anything nice for you.\n\nLegally, it would be seen as a gift, though I am not a lawyer, so I am not sure what your chances are of how that would go. However, only a d-bag would not return something with such sentimentality at the end of a relationship. It isn't a simple engagement ring that was bought from a store.\n\nYou may want to consult with a lawyer or legal question subreddit to see what all options are available to you.", "Two totally different questions at the end there. Your feedback, if honest, is feedback. And how you feel. That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. He can take that and do with it what he will. \n\nGetting the ring back - if you were insistent on him keeping it when you left, you may be SOL. He could have done anything with it. Maybe he doesn\u2019t even have it anymore. You can ask for it back, but he doesn\u2019t have to give it. He should, but you kinda screwed yourself in a moment of guilt by saying he could keep it initially. \n\nNAH no assholes here.", "NTA for asking for the ring back or for your feedback.  IMO it was given under similar a idea as a promise or engagement ring and seeing as it's socially (and legally) acceptable to ask for those back, the same would apply here and that's not even taking your personal connection into consideration.  Your attachment and what the ring means to you only strengthens your case and it's extremely petty and  a good showing of his true colors that he feels entitled to it.  As far as the feedback, he asked for it and  it sounds like you gave him the truth and didn't sugarcoat it (which is the right way to do it).  Unfortunately I can almost guarantee it wasn't what he was wanting to hear since those types of conversations force you to recognize your flaws, but that was the risk he took.", "Tough call \u2026 I think you are NTA.\nI am struggling with him though\u2026 he could be a complete AT (most likely), or could be angry and hurt and want to hurt you (we have no Idea how your relationship and break up were). Maybe he feels manipulated (you gave it to him, agreed he should keep it after the break up, then ask him to return it), and feel like you just want to do it to hurt him more\u2026 either way if he is a decent person he will give it back to you (if he still has it).", "Yta. You let him keep it now you want it back? Learn from your mistakes. He is legally not required to give it back and honestly I wouldn\u2019t give it back especially after you blaming him for you deciding to change yourself acting like he told you to change. Only you are responsible for your life actions.", "NTA\n\nIf you haven't seen the ring recently, I would suspect he might have sold it.", "YTA - this sort of decision is not one to take lightly. You wouldn\u2019t give him back the present if he was in your situation.\nHe now has it so he can do with it whatever he pleases", "Do everything you can to bring it back or you will be forever sorry.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, you should never have given it or let him keep it in the first place. Legally, there doesn't seem to be much of a leg to stand on. How much do you think the ring might be worth at, say, a pawn shop? Consider offering him a similar amount for it back if you can afford it.\n\nPersonally, I do think he should have given it back since it's a sentimental item.", "Yes and no. You should have never given that ring away. Your Ex is being a jerk. Don't give up. Perhaps he'll give it back to you just to get rid of you", "YTA for giving up a family ring for an ex.

GOT it.", "NTA and the Y T A responses here are ridiculous. \n\nAny decent person would recognize the sentimental importance this ring has to you and WANT to return it. And probably would not have agreed to keep it on the first place. Him choosing not to return it makes him TAH. \n\nUnfortunately, there isn\u2019t much you can do about it. I\u2019d suggest having a replica made, incorporating metal or stones from any other jewelry you have have from your birthmother, or engraved or something to make it special to you, so you can transfer your sentimentality to a piece that remains in your possession.", "I wouldn't say you're an asshole but I do think you did a damn fool thing.  You gave a treasured memento of your passed-away mother to a boyfriend of a few months?   Come on!    \n\n\nI really, really hope you get the ring back, but you've got no legal ground to stand on so unless he decides to do the right thing, you're toast.    \n\n\nI hope you approach future relationships with a little more maturity.", "Let him know small claims court is an option you might pursue.  Nothing to be lost and it may prompt him to give it back.  Who wants to stand in front of a judge and try to justify not returning an heirloom ring after a breakup.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou had so many opportunities not to lose this ring - don't give it to him, or accept it back when he offered. He has done his due diligence in offering to return it, you said no, so now the ring is his. Learn from this - don't give sentimental items to people you've been dating for less than a year, and don't reject their offer to return it if it matters to you. The ring is his now.", "NTA \n\nYou should take a breather before you ask again. Did you break things off or did he? If it was you I wouldn\u2019t be above giving him hope if rekindling the relationship just to get the ring back. \n\nIn the future, don\u2019t give sentimental items to significant others. That was a very dumb move.", "YTA. It was a gift. It belongs to him now. It is NOT your ring. It was not given in contemplation of marriage. You also don't seem to be owning your responsibility for the problems in the relationship -- putting the blame on him for WHO were in the relationship.", "NTA - but I think it is a soft one.  To ask is rude for a gift but I think understandable under the circumstances.  It was a gift though so you should never give a gift you will want back later.

ESH.", "Your Ex is being a jerk. Don't give up.

So ESH for me", "Yeah the  y t a and n a h votes are confusing me. He clearly is just keeping it and parading it around to hurt her. He said he'd give it back, but now is just refusing to tell her anything. He's a giant asshole.", "Also too acc to your story OP put herself in this position so now OP has to face the consequences. Definition of \u201cActions have consequences\u201d", "Just because it might be legal for him to keep it, doesn't mean he's not an asshole if he does. If he sold it he should tell her, but it sounds like he's been parading it around town if her friend is to be believed.", "Probably to disambiguate her from a stepmother, adoptive mother or whatever mother figure raised her.", "For me, context matters. If she indicated that he had stolen the ring from her, I would have offered a very different response.", "Wdym it was a decision op made within a few months of dating someone. She volunteered to gift/cease owning a prize sentimental possession. Calling that foolish is calling a spade a spade", "Two reasons. The first is probably unpopular - I think that once you give a gift, it is given. You don't take it back. She gave it then passed on reclaiming it when offered. I can understand that she made a mistake in giving him the ring, but she now is asking for it back, which I see as an asshole move. I think more people would be more supportive of the second reason - that when you are bequeathed an item at death, treat it with care (e.g., don't give it away to someone you've known for 6 months.)", "Except he offered to give it back when the broke up and she said she didn\u2019t want it back", "yeah it does", "And you don\u2019t think a decent person would understand OP\u2019s sentimental attachment to the ring and WANT to return it?\n\nOP obviously fucked up in giving it away, but her ex is the one choosing not to return it despite being aware of how she feels.", "I think that he should return it. I did not choose E S H because he initially offered it back. I can't really call him an A H because he tried to do the right thing initially. A month later - she's back. I would still want him to return it as the right thing. I think at this point, it would be more \"fair\" of her to offer to buy it back.", "Yeah, giving the ring back would be the right thing, morally speaking. So he\u2019s choosing to the wrong thing, knowing it hurts OP, and this doesn\u2019t make him TAH because she made a mistake in saying she should keep in the emotional throes of a breakup?\n\nHow is he not TAH here for choosing to do the morally wrong thing, knowingly hurting someone?\n\nIf you want to say she\u2019s TAH for asking for something back that had previously given away, I can get behind that, but he\u2019s knowingly and intentionally choosing to not return her dead mother\u2019s ring. I just can\u2019t see how that\u2019s morally justifiable.", "ESH but, I doubt you\u2019ll see the ring, it\u2019s prolly been sold already.", "esh\n\nyou for saying he could keep it then changing your mind.\n\nhim for not returning it.", "YTA because you gave it to him and for then saying he could keep it. He has no obligation to return it, though I hope he does for your sake.", "She had 2 opportunities. Once to not give it to him in the first place, and once to take it back when he offered when they broke up. Now he is moving on and she wants it back. That\u2019s not how it works. The gift has been \u201cratified\u201d doubly now. Actions have consequences unfortunately."]}
