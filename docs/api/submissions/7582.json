I thought including that detail might make me seem more petty than I am about the situation and make the post a little longer than it needed to be. I wanted to focus on the situation as it was then. \n\nAfter the divorce, I spent some time trying to figure out how much blame was mine and hers, because everything is shades of grey, not black and white. This happened about a month before we decided to separate and I found out she\u2019d been kissing a married guy from work in the parking lot. I didn\u2019t want THAT information to color the situation. I wanted to be focused on my own behavior. Thank you to everyone for the responses though.\n\nI (34m) played HS baseball and recently picked up softball and have been having a blast. I forgot how much I loved playing. I had been asking my wife (35f) to come see a game. Problem is, I joined a league my buddy plays for about 45 minutes away, so it\u2019s a bit of a haul. \n\nBut I wanted her to see one and feel supported and for our son to attend too so that he could see that side of me. I had asked her to come to one but hasn\u2019t gotten her on-board yet. I try to be supportive and have attended her 5ks in the past. \n\nThe spring season passed ~12 games and fall season was wrapping up ~10 games over 5 nights. I asked if she might attend the playoffs of the final night. I told her we were terrible and would likely only play one game that night. She agreed. \n\nGame night comes, I pick up son from daycare. She gets home and I have to be at the field earlier to warm up  and she needs to get home and decompress from work/change etc. So I offer to take our son so it\u2019s easier for her to get ready and we take separate cars.\n\nFirst inning goes by and she\u2019s a no show, second inning goes by and she\u2019s a no show. My son is staying in the dugout by himself while we\u2019re in the field and the guys keep him company in the dugout while we\u2019re hitting. \n\n3rd inning, she shows up with ice cream but the game ends after the 4th inning because we got smoked (10-run rule).\n\nShe can tell I\u2019m upset and explained that she was unfamiliar with the city and didn\u2019t realize how to get to the dairy queen and it made her late and she was sorry. \n\nI was still upset and told her so. This was important to me and I felt I wasn\u2019t supported. She commented that she still showed up, just that she miscalculated and was sorry. I feel like I\u2019m expecting too much and might have been a bigger jerk about the situation than I should have been. I don\u2019t expect her to attend every one but I felt that showing up to one wasn\u2019t too big of an ask. \n\nSo, AITA for expecting her to attend a game?", "created_utc": 1673980224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ejid3/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_come_to_a_softball/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because 20 days ago you were thinking of introducing your SO to your ex-wife before you introduced her to your son.", "NTA. This was something you expressed was important to you. Whether consciously or not, your wife didn't put much effort to ensuring she'd get there on time.\n\nOP, it's OK that you're upset, but if she's genuinely remorseful don't hold it against her.", "Definitely NTA. Turning up to watch just one game to show support and interest in your partners activities isn't exactly a show-stopper. Especially as it's something you've done for her in the past.\n\nEdit... The fact that she went for ice cream despite already running significantly late, makes it even more clear that she didn't really care about your game.", "NTA for being upset, but you have to stop dwelling on this. Your marriage is over. Going back over these incidents isn't healthy for you. Just move on.", "NTA. You let her know it was important to you and she failed to be show that she cared", "Nta", "NTA. You deserve to be heard. If she can\u2019t see your side of things and you don\u2019t feel valued/appreciated, suggest getting counseling so you have another perspective. These are the things that build up and take a toll over time, that can ultimately cause resentment and separation. Going to counseling and learning how to communicate openly can help. For me it\u2019s a place where I can say what I feel without having to hold back, and I also hear what I need to.", "Wait is this ex wife or your current girlfriend? That's important.", "NTA, I would have said N A H, but she went to Dairy Queen and got ice cream. The moment she realised she was running late, she should have skipped the Dairy Queen and gone straight to your game. Your wife, son and you could have all gone to the dairy Queen afterwards together. I also don\u2019t understand all the Y T A. OP didn\u2019t force his wife to go, he didn\u2019t badger her into going, he told her how he feels and he would like her to go to ONE game. Going was the wife\u2019s choice but she flacked in favour of ice crema", "NAH. I get why you want her there, but asking someone to drive an hour and a half after work to watch a thirty minute game is a lot. If you wanted her there, you should have joined a closer league. If you rather play with your friend, you should just take your son yourself to games. \n\nI played low level mixed doubles tennis and there was never an audience. Adult rec sports are fun for the players. They aren\u2019t really spectator sports.", "This is a relatively minor thing from a long time ago with an Ex. Just move on, stop living in the past, this literally doesn\u2019t matter any more.", "Wait, what? You want judgement on your EX-wife, about a situation that happened in the past? Info: WHY?", "NTA. You clearly expressed how important this was to you, and she missed it over ice cream. You have every right to be deeply upset about her clear lack of support.", "You are not the a-hole for asking her to attend one game with your son, and you even made it easier by taking your son to free up her time to decompress, first, after work and not have to arrive early while you were warming up.  That sounds great, and I think you should have expected she could come, and reasonably on time.\n\nHowever, as what happens sometimes on Reddit, we get only one sliver of what is going on, and so it might be helpful if you give further explanation about your time commitments to this hobby and others.  You mention the location for the games is 45 minutes away . . . so 1 1/2 hours drive time, in addition to leaving early for warming up.  How long does the typical game take and when you add up your driving time, game time and the extra time to warm up, what is your time away from home?  Also, do you only play games, or do you also practice, and again, what does that schedule look like?\n\nWhat I am getting at is that it is perfectly acceptable and good to have your own, separate hobbies.  It's healthy.  However, there is sometimes an imbalance in a couple between what each person allots time-wise and expense-wise for their hobbies versus the other, and how that affects their time with each other, their commitments at home, and the amount of time they spend with their kids.\n\nIf your wife coming to only one practice and late, at that, was truly just poor planning, that's one thing, but if your wife did this because of a conscious or sub-conscious resentment that building, then you have something else going on, and probably warrants some thought and discussion.  \n\nFor example, if the extent in using your time to support your wife's interests involves watching her run a 5K twice a year, and an occasional Saturday watching your child so she can go out for a run . . . but you spend hours daily practicing and playing in softball games, or other hobbies, while your wife is left at home after a day's work to do all the household chores, watch your child and the whole afternoon/evening routine . . . then not really an equal comparison.\n\nIf this is the case, then she is probably feeling that your life is very out of balance, and that you get way more free-time to indulge your interests and hobbies than she does, and is resentful whether she realizes it or not.\n\n***This is not an assumption . . . just asking for clarification to make sure that is NOT what is happening.***", "Meh honestly I think YTA but my own views may be clouding my judgement. I just never really get the whole \u2018they should support me\u2019 part by going and watching something they may have no interest in. IMO she is/was supporting you by looking after your kid whilst you play softball for (considering the 1.5 hour commute) I assume about 4 hour a few times a week. You said you went to her 5ks but did she care if you did? My husband played rugby, I never went to one game. Don\u2019t care for the sport, it\u2019s bloody freezing as it\u2019s played autumn to spring and I had better ways to spend my weekend. Did he care..no because it\u2019s his hobby not mine. If I decided to take up knitting I wouldn\u2019t expect him to sit and watch me stitch, or watch me paint, or watch me run. I find the whole thing rather self serving. You get the joy for doing what you love and you get the joy from your wife and kid watching which she seemed to not want to do so what exactly did she get out of it? She went, got lost and apologised. I think you are making a mountain out of a mole hill tbh", "Wait I need more info. Was the Ice Cream for HER or for your son? Like did she stop to get all of you ice cream or to get one for herself?", "NAH\n\nHave you stated to her how you wrote it here why you\u2019d like her to come? Has she stated that she doesn\u2019t want to or failed to come when she said she would ever?\n\nYour desire seems heartfelt and clear. On the flip side, it\u2019s important to recognize it can\u2019t/ won\u2019t ever mean as much for her and she might not totally get why it matters to you. Seems like she did make an effort and was genuinely (?) apologetic for it.\n\nKeep up the communication and the love of the game!", "NTA, I guess you don't need to go to any 5ks now. Instead, you can go to a ball park with your son and throw some balls, and then go get some DQ.", "NTA 100%\n\nYou communicated like an adult and asked for something that should have been a no-brainer for ANY committed couple, let alone a married couple. Your request wasn't unreasonable, you didn't demand she show up for the whole season and throw a tantrum when she didn't. You even compromised to make it easier for her by taking your son and going in separate cars.\n\nIt's a little lame she was late because she went for ice cream, isn't that what you're supposed to do AFTER the game? Sorry she's not more supportive.", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. You aren\u2019t unreasonable to want your son to come see a game but she\u2019s also not unreasonable for not going to your rec league games 45 minutes away like she\u2019s your high school girlfriend.", "NTA\n\nAsking her to come to one game is not too much to ask.  Asking her to come to every game would be a little crazy but one game if it is important to you is something she should do.\n\nIn her defense though, she didn't just totally blow it off, she did come (but was late) and it seems like she didn't realize it was that important to you and is genuinely sorry.  Now that you've expressed your feelings, she'll probably show up next time.", "NAH. Have you considered that she was also \"supporting\" you by being ok with you traveling 45 minutes each way, warming up, and playing softball games all season? While you were gone for 3 hours+ each time, guess who was at home watching your daycare-aged son, feeding him dinner, etc ? My husband's never seen the sport I do, but he watches our kid multiple times a week so I can do it. I appreciate that.", "NTA.   There's this cool thing called Google Maps.   I'm told even Dairy Queen locations are on it.   Your wife might want to look into it.", "As a wife who has sometimes attends my husband's  softball games at various distances from home and who enjoys cheering him on, you are definitely NTA! I hope she can make it up to you by appearing on time to future games. I wouldn't be too hard on her for it but an apology only helps so much.", "NTA but I\u2019ve been playing softball for like 10 years now (and my team is very good, often wins tournaments and seasons), and my wife has come out maybe 2 times lol. She\u2019s not into it, it\u2019s boring for her, I get it. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t push too hard. Just treat it as your own personal time, not as one of the things you do together. My wife is really into CrossFit and I have absolutely no interest in that, so that\u2019s her thing.", "INFO: How did you \"tell her\" you were disappointed?", "NTA\n\nYou aren't asking much for her to attend a game now & then. Sad that she felt getting ice cream was more important than arriving on time.", "NTA. You asked for support from the person who is supposed to support you. I'm not calling her an AH but giving her the benefit of the doubt, she must not have understood how important this was to you.", "NTA\n\nShe was late and still stopped for an ice cream. Not very supportive unfortunately... and it obviously meant a lot to you.", "INFO \n\nDoes your wife have Google Maps on here phone or any device in her vehicle to give her directions and time estimates?", "In a relationship, it's important to support each other and attend some of their events and activities. You clearly know this since you support your wife's 5k runs. \n\nThat said, you're asking a lot of her to drive 45 minutes each way. Given the example here, the game was over pretty quickly. IDK how long a softball game runs, but if it was over after the 4th, then she'd probably have spent more time driving than watching the game even if she'd been there from the top of the 1st. I'm guessing it's going to be harder to get her to come to future games after that.\n\nIf you want her to come to your games with any regularity then you should look for a closer league - something in your town if you can. Purely based on distance, I'm going to say NAH. Cut that drive time in half and the vote would be different.", "INFO: To what extent did other teammates families/significant others come to the game?  And is your wife generally kinda flaky when it comes to timing?", "Nta. Everyone has phones with maps", "Your wife is not interested in your hobby, and asking her to drive an hour and a half round trip to watch you play a game she had no interest in is asking a lot. But she did.  She finished a long day at work then slogged over.  She got lost so she was late.  You think she went through that drive to be intentionally late? \n\nThat said, I do think it would be nice if she could watch a couple of games with your son.  But ffs, maybe make it less awful?  Surely you will have a game on a day when she doesn't have to work.  Drive over together and have a nice family meal out before our after the game.  Make it as fun for her to go as it is for you.  \n\nI'm going to say NAH, so long as you focus on the win-win option.  Good luck next season and kudos for a hobby that gets you outdoors and getting exercise.  \u26be\ufe0f", "I'm gonna be downvoted, but YTA. Chicago Sports and Social Club, right? You're playing what is, for all intents and purposes, an IM league with over-the-hill men. She was late because she got lost getting ice cream for your son, not because she was sitting at home painting her nails.\n\nI cannot imagine being so self-important as to get angry at my wife for being late to one of my men's league hockey games (after travelling 45 minutes one way!), but you do you.", "You play 45 minutes away from home, and you expect her to go see you play after work?", "NTA.\n\nYou deserve to have support. She should be thrilled to show up and cheer you on. And besides, everyone knows ice cream happens AFTER the game. That girl don't love you the same way you love her, and it shows.", "Nta. If she had been to some games in the past and this one she was late, that would be one thing. This was the only one she showed up to and was late. Why could she not have done ice cream after the game? Sure, it wasn't malicious, but it shows where her priorities lie. \n\nAlso, these ppl commenting that you essentially need to grow up or it's not worth watching a bad team can kick rocks. A partnership is about supporting each other, which you do by showing up for her interests. Yes, I absolutely expect a partner to drive 45 minutes for someone they supposedly love. I've driven over 2 hours to see games or events of family and friends because it shows i care about them. When I go, I do so on time to show integrity and respect. \n\nI don't think your wife is some evil person who doesn't love you. However, in this situation, it is an asshole move. It's also teaching your child that you dont need to prioritize your partner, only yourself and your needs. It's just something to think about.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s truly sorry and wanted to be there, but got lost on the way or missed some turns. I doubt she would have driven the 45 minutes if she was covering up for not wanting to be there. That being said, it is perfectly normal for you to feel disappointed and frustrated. Talk to her about it and plan more in advance next season - maybe ask her to come for one of the five nights you play and leave it up to her what night would work best in order to be there in time.", "NTA\n\nI was going to say NAH until she agreed to come, then bailed on both you and your son.\n\nIt's fair for her not to be interested.\n\nBut it's also fair that you want your partner to take interest what you do.\n\nOne game wouldn't kill her, and it looks like she deliberately missed it.\n\nIt's not fair to promise something and then not show up.", "YTA. It\u2019s fucking softball. It\u2019s your hobby. It\u2019s not her hobby. She watches your child while you go do your hobby. That\u2019s supporting your hobby. It\u2019s the equivalent of me asking my wife to watch me play basketball with the boys on Wednesday night. It\u2019s pointless. Do your hobby for you and don\u2019t force it on others.", "Nta, I think you asked very little of her. Is this a pattern, is this the only time she hasn't shown the same support expected of you for her events?\n\nWhy wouldn't she have just waited til after the game and you all could have gotten ice cream after.\n\nSome of the best memories growing up were going to my dad's softball games (they weren't that good either), watching him play or hanging out with the other kids around the field, then going for pizza afterwards and begging for quarters from all the other dad's to play the arcade games.", "You\u2019re not the asshole for expecting her to attend a game. You are the asshole for not counting her showing up to your game as her coming to a game. She did! If she doesn\u2019t know anything about sports, she might have assumed it would be as long as a baseball game. It\u2019s not her fault you suck. And she brought you ice cream? You sound awful. Poor woman.", "YTA.  This a recreational game.  Grow up.", "YTA. It sounds like she made an actual mistake and has tried to apologize for it, and you\u2019re acting like she did it on purpose. She showed up. It\u2019s not her fault you\u2019re extremely bad at softball and she only caught the very end of the game.", "ESH. It's not too much to ask for her to attend one game. In hindsight, you probably should have ridden together rather than take two vehicles. She should have planned to be early to avoid being late, and you should be forgiving because she actually did show up after getting lost.", "YTA she showed up,  not her fault that the game was called in the 4th inning. She also sincerely apologized.", "YTA, you want her to give you a participation trophy too? Newsflash, nobody cares abt your adult softball league except for you.", "YTA - this is mens league softball? She still showed up with ice cream? the only thing that makes sense here is you getting 10 run ruled.", "NTA - she should have heard you when you stated it was important to you", "You really need to put the fact that you\u2019re divorced and the REASON for your divorce much higher, your title is pretty misleading", "Why would you want your wife to attend an event that you are being crushed? What support is necessary in this scenario? She was coming to see you play poorly. \n\nNothing wrong with your son being in the dugout, as long as he was safe. Kids are much more resilient that we give them credit for. I bet he saw this as the highlight of the day.", "ESH.  You're not TA for expecting her to come to a game, but give her a break.

She made it there eventually \\*and\\* brought ice cream. \n\nSo will you now be attending something that she loves to do?", "YTA - it\u2019s 45 minutes away and she has a small child.

For a number of years after she would attend some of those games because she was interested in the sport and was friends with my teammates, but even that faded over time as the composition of my team changed and more and more of our friends left the sport.\n\nIt was a big ask for the OP to have her drive 45 minutes to a game, and she did it. I don\u2019t blame her for being late because who wants to watch recreational softball anyways (especially a game where you are expecting to be blown out)?", "No worries, this is why I asked.", "She got one for her and our son, none for me. \n\nWhich doesn\u2019t bother me, it\u2019s nice she thought of him and any she\u2019d have gotten me would have melted during the game so that\u2019s not a big issue for me.", "Yes! Plus, I'm confused why he was even mad in the first place (disappointed, yes; mad, no), because she still got there in the 3rd inning! She was going to be there for 2/3 of the game - it's not her fault it ended in the 4th inning!", "You can even do multiple stops sp it would route your way to ice cream then the ballpark", "Most of them live in town, so not hard to come but some wives/parents come routinely and some every third game or so. \n\nI understand she\u2019s coming from a long way so I was really just expecting/hoping for the one.", "I can get lost in a shopping mall. I understand logically I shouldn't but I still do.", "She got lost finding herself a snack, because she figured that was more important than being on time.", "It shouldn't matter what he was actually doing, the fact that it was important to him is what matters. I'm sure they could have gotten ice cream afterward as a family instead of her bringing ice cream for herself and their son only.", ">She was late because she got lost getting ice cream for your son\n\nDid that have to be done at that very moment? The DQ will still be there when the game is over, but the game had a set time.", "Why does it matter they're, in your words, over the hill? Op expressed he enjoyed the hobby and wanted to feel supported by his wife. She didn't bother making one game the whole season.", "He asked for one game. That is certainly not a crazy ask.", "Fair question. She would get home around 5 and games started at 6:30 or 7:30.", "I got the impression that this game happened to be after work, but we don\u2019t know they all of them are. It also sounds like he\u2019s given her plenty of choices of games on the schedule.", "She was late, she didn't miss it. How was she supposed to know it was going to end in the 4th inning? \n\nIf she was going to deliberately miss it, she wouldn't have been there during the 3rd inning.", "The ice cream was for mom and son. He got nothing.", "This was also the last game of a season he had been begging her to attend all year. I still think NTA", "She went to get ice cream before coming to the game. She could have waited until after the game and gone as a family and arrived earlier to watch some of the game.", "I dunno, man, not showing up until it's half over (assuming they didn't get smoked) with an ice cream is pretty shitty. It's one game, I don't care if she finds it boring as hell. It was 1 game, and she showed up really late with an ice cream. I'd feel pretty unsupported, as well.", "Not trying to mislead. I tried to present the situation as it happened. Putting ex-wife throughout the story may make me sound jaded when I wasn\u2019t jaded at the time. I wanted opinions on my \u201cwife\u201d, not my ex-wife. \n\nI made a judgement call but I\u2019m not trying to mislead anyone.", "It was more just making sure he didn\u2019t wander off or (highly unlikely) someone try to make off with him. He was 4 at the time and trying to keep an eye on him from the field was frustrating and distracting. But I also made the decision to bring him so it\u2019s partly my fault.", "Second paragraph of his post, he does attend and support her:   I try to be supportive and have attended her 5ks in the past.", "Except OP took their son to the game. So she did *not* actually have a small child with her. Actually, she decided to just leave her child when she knew he couldn\u2019t be watched by a parent, in order to get ice cream", "He had the small child, not her.", "OP please ignore this person", "It's crazy for someone to ask for support from his or her significant other?", "You're an adult, gatekeeping fun, do YOU know how that sounds?", "A husband deserves support from his wife for something that is important. Especially since he has attended things to support her (her 5K).", "Presumably her 5K races are also children's games?  Given the obesity epidemic in the US (and while they play softball in other countries, this is sounding pretty much like the states), we oughta be supportive of folks getting out there and actually exercising, rather than criticizing them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Even if not it was clearly inconsiderate. NTA(edit)", "It wasn't only Dairy Queen she was getting...", "But why is he asking about this if this is his ex wife? It sounds like he is looking for a specific answer to a specific non issue because he isn't married to her any more.", "She obviously doesn't really care about him if it's like this", "According to your profile you have an ex wife and an SO you were already wanting to have meet your son. Are you asking about having your ex attend your softball games? Because if she\u2019s an ex she doesn\u2019t owe it to you to come.", "Ok then in that case I am going NAH. She may have promised/told you son she was going to get him ice cream (or she may have just been planning it for him as a nice treat she wanted to give him at his Dad's game).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think we may have another causality of Ye' Old Communication again. Just asking her to come to a game or saying you want your son to see you play may not be getting the FULL point of,\n\n\"Hey! I am passionate about this, and it makes me feel good! I would really appreciate it if you made it a priority to try and come to a game to support me. I understand it's a longer driver and it's after work for you but it is important to me that you come to support me a little bit.\"\n\nSometimes (I do this ALL the dang time) we say things in a way that makes it sound more like a casual idea or suggestion because we don't want to sound demanding or whiny but then the other party doesn't realize how important it really is to us.\n\nSome times working in primary colors paints a better picture. State directly how you feel and she might better understand the importance of the issue to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso good for you, for finding something that makes you happy. It's an important thing that we as adults forget to do for ourselves. It's probably been making you a better husband, and father. :)", "It's a recreational softball game. Why does she need to be \"on time\"?", "Dude, maybe she was hungry after that ridiculous drive.  \n\nETA My apologies for not paying attention and noticing the comment wasn't from the OP.  The line left is all that is actually relevant for the reply.", "No, it absolutely matters. This is a pathetically meaningless incident and the fact that OP is still harping on this years after he divorced this woman is more ammunition for my belief that OP is an immature loon.\n\n>I'm sure they could have gotten ice cream afterward as a family instead of her bringing ice cream for herself and their son only.\n\nLmao her son was sitting alone in a dugout. Getting him ice cream is a far higher priority than watching some obese men run around the plates.", "The son was sitting alone in a dugout surrounded by 40 year old men lmao. Tell me you're not a parent without telling me you're not a parent.", "Who needs \"support\" for doing something they love recreationally?", "Because the only time people care about watching unrelated people do athletics is if they're at the top of their game. OP isn't Tom Brady, so that's not the case here. Sorry that I offended you with my comment though, are you also over the hill?", "Agreed. One game a season for her to show up on time and stay the entire game and support him is a reasonable ask. I'm sure he would love her to do it every week but hes not asking that.", "Which one was this? 6:30 or 7:30? What time did she get home from work?", "I'm going to be honest with you - I know nothing about sports and I have no idea how long 3 innings would take.\n\nBut I've done acting, and I can tell you that if my partner showed up after the break, I'd have been a bit disappointed. \n\nIt's honest it was a genuine mistake to be late. But it seems to me like she constantly downplayed how important this was to OP, even on the actual date she agreed to come. \n\nIf I went to my partner's event, I'd at least check the route (and I have ADHD).", "Ice cream is for winners", "I wonder how fast he got mercied. 4 innings could take a short time if they are terrible. She could have been only 20 minutes late. And now that I know this happened a long time ago with his ex? Eh I think we\u2019re missing a lot.", "She still showed up to the game, it was just late. If the game had been a normal length, she\u2019d have been there over half the game. She\u2019s also showing up right after work, so it\u2019s entirely possible she didn\u2019t eat anything beforehand either. Either way, making a mistake and getting lost doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t care at all or that she\u2019s even really an AH in this situation.", "\ud83d\ude06 why does the ice cream factor in so much?", "But I mean if you actually want to say what the reason for your divorce is, since you ignored that question, I\u2019m all ears :)", "You are jaded.

I think with time you\u2019ll be grateful she\u2019s an ex.", "Support is for something serious, not an adult playing a kid's game.  Sure, attendance would be nice, but that's a different matter.", "Fun does not require *support.*  OP isn't a child.", ">A husband deserves support from his wife for something that is important. \n\nAgreed.  This isn't it.", "Not offended, co-worker had moved about 3 months prior to this although they maintained texting each other. \n\nI don\u2019t doubt that kind of stuff happened but for this specific instance she was clean.", "I think he is probably looking back at instances of contention in their marriage and trying to provide a neutral explanation to see if he is to blame for her infidelity by expecting too much of her", "I don\u2019t like jumping to conclusions based on one situation, but she certainly has a giant blind spot on how to be mutually supportive in a relationship.", "This was my ex. Happened about a year and a half ago before the divorce", "1) Game was nearly over when she arrived. Did she even see OP have an at-bat?\n2) Even though OP sounds like he was fine with it, her not being there on time forced him into childcare mode, so she actually made the situation worse by being late than if she had stayed home and watched the kid instead.", "I guess you don\u2019t ever ask your partner to support you in things you care about. That doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of relationship I would want to be in.", "You seem like a peach.\n\nThe person that responded to you is not the OP, so reading comprehension is low.\n\n45 minutes is not a ridiculous drive by any stretch of the imagination, unless you are brand new to driving.\n\nHe stated he made sure to support her for her hobbies and interests as well, and when he asks for mutual support, he receives nothing.\n\nHe is NTA, and based on how you respond to people, you are an absolute AH.", "Then SHE should have kept her son at home and just told her husband that she wasn't interested in going. The fact that she was kissing a married man is more ammunition that she was an inconsiderate asshole, to begin with.\n\nIf something is important to me, I don't care how meaningless a stranger thinks it is.

Attendance is not the same as support.", "Generally, in relationships, you support your partner. If OP expressed this is something he enjoys and asked his partner to go to ONE game, his spouse kind of sucks for not doing that. Especially considering he has attended her 5ks for the same reason.", "I can tell by your response you're just trying to get reactions from people. Whatever your issues are, hopefully you find happiness and better ways to use your time instead of putting people down to make yourself feel better. Best of luck.", "She gets home at 5, game was 6:30. FWIW, I get home slightly before her most days and picking up our son usually gets us there about the same time.

If they were getting slaughtered, the game could go pretty fast though. Very possible that they were in the 3rd inning after 20 minutes. OP didn't say whether she showed up at the top (beginning) or bottom (2nd half) of the inning. But she saw almost half of what was played, even with a shortened game. \n\nINFO: OP, not in innings, but in time: how late was she?", "3rd inning is, under normal circumstances, ~~1/3~~ a bit under 1/2 of the way through the game. I'm not a huge sports fan, but as I recall, you can come to a game partway through and quickly pick up what's happening and get into the game. It's very different from coming to a play during intermission.", "You are missing a lot. \n\nMarriages are complicated, I wasn\u2019t perfect and neither was she. But I really just wanted info on this specific incident and told it as plainly as I could which is why I omitted the divorce part. \n\nEx and I are great co parents and she\u2019s a good person, we just weren\u2019t good for each other I think.  \n\nAs to the other part of your question, I don\u2019t really remember. We have no problem on offense but we have one or two outfielders who can\u2019t catch. We spend a lot of time on defense. I want to say it was half an hour or so, most games last an hour.", "Because she's already late but takes the time to find a DQ and stop?

I took your advice.\n\nNot ignoring it\u2019s just not an interesting answer. We grew apart and when I found out she\u2019d had an affair, we decided to end it.

It was important to him, that's what matters.", "Not necessarily the infidelity, but yes.", "So why are you posting this like it just happened yesterday to a relationship that no longer exists?
