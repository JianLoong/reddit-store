Thankyou for that. \n\nMy uncle struggled with alcohol abuse when my cousin was younger. In the last ten years, he has really turned his life around, gone completely clean and made significant amends. I am very close to my cousin (34m) and I made sure to ask him if he was comfortable with me helping my uncle. I helped him go sober and I helped them reconnect after almost 10 years of NC. My cousin thinks his relationship with my uncle is too damaged for him to go beyond the occasional \u2018hello\u2019, but he did ask me to care for him if I was comfortable with it. I have 2 nieces (4f & 9f) and my cousin has always encouraged me to take them along whenever I visit my uncle. I don\u2019t think he thinks I\u2019m an AH but I understand where you\u2019re coming from.", "They were fairly successful. I started by propagating and selling plants to people in my neighbourhood at the age of 16. Expanded a little once I turned 18 and was earning pretty nicely for myself by the time I turned 19. No significant cost was involved, all propagations came from my own garden. Some of these were very sought after, expensive exotic plants. Shut that down as I thought I would have to move away for college soon. Then the pandemic hit, so I starting freelancing with social media marketing (I had a decent amount of experience, had interned in marketing before+had friends who ran marketing businesses) started by handling social media for small homegrown businesses owned by Friends of friends etc. eventually paired up with my best-friend who was studying digital marketing at the time. We both made good money working for about 10 brands earning almost 15k INR (180USD) per brand. Shut that down in 2021 because colleges finally opened and I had to move into a dorm. Started selling posters, LED lights, quirky lamps etc in college. Bought cheap stuff off the internet and sold it for 3x the price. Within months, I was selling to nearby colleges as well. I\u2019m an artist so I also designed custom posters that I sold for insane amounts to rich stoner kids and added rainbow backgrounds for the gays. All of this with very little investment. Finally decided the money I got from selling room decor wasn\u2019t enough. started writing assignments for 1INR per word. Eventually pulled some favours, got people to write the same assignments for 0.50rs per word and quoted 2rs per word (guaranteeing A, A+ or O grades)\nEventually shut that down to focus on finals. \n\nNot all businesses have to look like depressing corporate setups for them to be considered \u2018successful\u2019 \nI hope my professional journey gives you inspiration to do weird fucked up shit and earn money out of it (most of these were high thoughts that manifested into reality)\n\nAbout animosity for my brother, I have never actively felt anything against him. Despite being younger, I have always been protective of him. I truly believe that it is possible to have an opinion about someone\u2019s life without feeling animosity towards them. Thankyou for your advice. I have taken therapy for other issues in the past and will surely seek help for any issues if and when I see them affect my feelings towards my brother.", "Apologies for being vague. I didn\u2019t think the details would be very relevant. It began when my brother and I were little. He would always be allowed to buy more expensive toys, people always told me it\u2019s normal because he\u2019s older and generally younger kids break their toys sooner. My brother and I both went to boarding school. He is two classes above me. The last time my parents visited school was on his graduation (they didn\u2019t make it to my HS graduation bcos my grandma was sick) \nMy brother always used to get a birthday gift on my bday, usually the same thing I got. I would never get anything on his birthday. Dad would usually take my brother along w him whenever he went out while I wouldn\u2019t get asked. Family trips never included me because my dad would make it a point to go to places I wouldn\u2019t want to travel to (he\u2019s paying so everyone goes where he goes) \nThe biggest, most blatant sign was probably the fact that my dad had always told me he wouldn\u2019t buy me new shoes until my old pair was completely worn out (I was told I had to respect my belongings and not let my parents wealth go to my head) my brother has a massive sneaker collection, all expensive and paid for by dad. I wore the same shoes for 2 years (a pair my mom bought me) the most fucked up thing that he ever did to me was probably when I finished grade 10 with excellence in academics and co-curricular, got an award from the governor of my state (parents didn\u2019t attend the ceremony bcos grandma was sick) my dad asked me to look for cars within a budget since I would soon be allowed to drive. My brother passed class 12th with horrible scores and he was gifted the exact same car I told my dad I wanted (it was a sedan. My brother wanted a jeep) \nSkip to college. My dad never came to my college. I believe it\u2019s normal for parents to not visit colleges? Well. They visited my brothers college almost every month, both our colleges are the same distance from my dads in opposite directions. I recently graduated, he didn\u2019t show up to my graduation because my brother wasn\u2019t going to make it as he was on vacation with his friends. \nThe arguments were petty and spiteful because of the way he dealt with them? I don\u2019t want to make it sound like it was completely his fault. I used to get aggressive with my tone, especially when he would answer w stuff like \u2018I said no because I am paying for it\u2019 or \u2018because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you need right now\u2019 \nThese arguments usually always ended with him asking me to learn how to ask for things from my brother? Basically asking me to learn how to manipulate my dad in order to convince to buy stuff for me. Lastly, the most hurtful thing, it is a common cultural practice in my region to bring in birthdays and not celebrate them on the day of the birthday. Like, we cut the cake and wish people at 12am on the day their birthday begins. My dad would always cook for my brother and his friends on his birthday, always drank with them until 2am (after he turned 18) etc. however, on my birthday, every year, he is always \u2018sick\u2019. Never meets my friends. Never cuts the cake with me. Never wishes me until the next morning. \nHope that was enough detail. I believe I may have also been a little too passive aggressive while talking to him over the last few years, but I don\u2019t think that should be enough reason to create such an immense gap in the way you treat your children.", "I\u2019m sorry, I did not mean to talk shit about my brother. I really do love him and we are closer than most siblings. As for the examples, I realise there isn\u2019t enough context in my initial post, however, I have replied to a post explaining the situation in a little more detail. Please let me know if you are unable to find said comment, I would be glad to copy/paste here. \nMy intention was not to judge my brother, only to point out that a lot of people find favouritism towards the overachieving child somewhat normal. I only wanted to explain that this isn\u2019t the case here. \nI have owned businesses, and made a lot of money. But it\u2019s alright if you think that\u2019s BS. I don\u2019t think it holds much relevance to the post anyway. \nAnd lastly, the what I said wasn\u2019t a response to him refusing to give me his car. It was a reaction that came out of a dark, resentful place that I have held for many years. Bottled up emotions from 5+ years.", "Why does the neglected son suck? Dad was shitty and fafo.", "Omg, you're a bloody saint to show such forbearance, forgiveness, and sensitivity. If you were my son, I'd be proud and happy to know you. #Integrity", "The writing assignments sounds sketchy as heck. But...Indian?  Yeah, I've heard that sort of thing is routine in Indian unis.  To the point of aggression against exam proctors.\n\nYou sound like quite the hustler.", "your dad clearly favours your brother but that thing about getting your brother the car you said you wanted when your brother wanted a different car just seems i don't really know how to describe it maybe malicious or spiteful. Like im sure your brother was happy to get a car for free even if it wasnt the one he wanted but that feels like something you do just to taunt the person you know wanted that car.", "Damn I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s be really hard\n\nEdit: sorry if it seemed like a shitty thing to ask. I know In our family, and I think a lot others, there are always times it\u2019s not 50/50 for whatever reason. But it\u2019s supposed to even out in the end. The shit you listed is egregious .", "I already answered your question when I said I agree with his family.", "Okay I\u2019ve never written an exam. These assignments were mostly internals or midterm papers, and yes, this is very common in India. \nI\u2019ve been girlbossing my way through early adulthood. Rejecting corporate slavery like my ancestors rejected colonialism\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb", "Yeah I felt like trash when that happened. He told me it was easier since he didn\u2019t need to \u2018go find a car\u2019 for my brother. My brother was pretty happy but also offered to share it (he knew it was the car I wanted) \nI never drove it or asked to borrow it, though. I think that hurt ego pretty badly.", "No you didn't answer his question but it's cute you think you did.", "honestly part of me thinks its less your dad actively favouring your brother and more him passively disliking you for some bizarre reason. Which does end up with the same result of him favouring your brother but in a way that design atleast in part to put you down."]}
