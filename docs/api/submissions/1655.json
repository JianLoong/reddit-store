This summer I was looking for activities for us to do together. The only thing I could find was a series of \"mommy and me\" classes at the community center. I inquired whether I could take her, seeing as she has no mother figure in her life (mother lives in another state and has gone no contact) and was told no. \n\nThat didn't seem fair to me, seeing as this is a small town and there isn't anything else of this nature available, and also this is a city-run community center that is funded by our taxes. So I wrote a polite letter to the head of the community center explaining my situation and asking them to reconsider this policy. She replied back suggesting that I have \"a female relative or neighbor\" bring my daughter to the classes. \n\nThat didn't sit well with me, and I admit I was a bit hot-headed at that point, so I fired off an e-mail to my city council member. He replied that he would \"have our legal counsel look into the matter\".  That was in June, and I didn't hear anything back ever since. \n\nMy daughter started daycare in September due to my work schedule, and she commented that other kids were not treating her nicely.  I thought that was normal for young kids, and told her to ignore it. \n\nFinally, last week a neighbor told me what had happened.  The city determined that not allowing fathers into the classes would violate the law, and instructed the community center to correct this.  They decided to correct it by cancelling the classes, halfway through the summer. They didn't say why (supposedly it was blamed on COVID but I don't think anyone bought that) but eventually the word spread that I was the reason.  \n\nPart of me feels bad right now, but I don't think I did anything wrong. It's not like I sued them, I just complained to the city.  And of course, my daughter is being treated badly by other kids and parents at daycare, and this will probably get worse when she starts actual school.\n\nEDIT: Someone asked a good question.  The head of the community center did actually give me an explanation, sorry I left that part out. The explanation was that several years ago they did try having some \"parent and me\" classes in addition to \"mommy and me\", but the \"parent and me\" classes were cancelled due to low enrollment.", "created_utc": 1667784469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo8x8l/aita_for_inadvertently_getting_our_towns_mommy/", "score": 889, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are almost no \"mommy and me\" type classes where the gender of the parent is of the slightest relevance.", "I was a bit on the fence at first but the fact that you didn\u2019t push to shut them down, and that they made the BS choice to stop the class over the possibility of letting in single fathers make it NTA. It was 100% a discriminatory decision on their part. And having literally any female in your child\u2019s life who doesn\u2019t fill the same role as a parent really negates the point of the bonding class. It\u2019s also likely someone running it or their close friends are the ones spreading rumors that you made them shit down and not their choice to continue a sexist practice. Like what would they do if there was a gay couple who adopted a baby, or other dads in your position who just want to get their parenting started the best ways they can. Now they\u2019re pushing their discriminatory bs on their kids to bully your daughter. It\u2019s not ok", "So rather than allow dads, they cancelled them? That was seen as the better option? That\u2019s not your fault. NTA", "That's probably why my library just called it \"baby story time\", or toddler play time\". I was one of a few Grandmas,  there were male and female parents, and even a couple nannies. It was awesome, all the kids played while the grown ups got to have adult interaction. I miss those days, lol. Now my granddaughter is a tween, and trips to the library with Grammy just don't measure up anymore.", "NTA, wtf is wrong with your city? Rather than let a dad in, they cancelled the whole damn thing? Ridiculous.", "NTA this is such a weird choice to double down on by the community center.", "NTA. Their policy was discriminatory and bullshit. They were the ones who decided to cancel it instead of letting in men. If it's a city run group they can't be doing shit like that. If it was a private support group you'd tried to have shut down then you'd be an asshole, but mummy and me classes are typically just fun bonding activities for parent and kid and a good place to meet other parents. I'd contact the daycare leaders and make a complaint about bullying.\n\nOne place your an asshole \"told her to ignore it\" never ever fucking do that. She came to you because she trusts you and you ignored her. Thats how you teach a child to take abuse.", "NTA \n\nAnd shame on the mothers, basically bullying your daughter by proxy of their own children. the group instead of remembering that in the 21st centurary there are more that the (one mum one dad family) set up this event that pushed out gay dads/guardians and single dads. they punished you for their own narrow minded views. \n\ni love it when the PTA mums are outed for their bigatory", "NTA them cancelling the classes is not on you. That was someone being petty, or someone not wanting to deal with weirdos who are under the impression that any man who joins such a class must by definition be a creep (yes, those kind of people are out there). But of course you will be blamed for ruining it for everyone.", "NTA. This was blatant discrimination and the community center chose to close classes rather than be inclusive. Flip this, what if it was only daddy and me, would the moms have been ok with it? What if it was based on race rather than gender? Or income or any of the other categories that some people fall into but not others. Isn\u2019t the goal to socialize your children and provide a learning experience?  Why is that only for mothers?  The parents who are taking this out on your child are bigoted fools who will raise the same.", "Nta at all. They chose to be unreasonable and shut down the classes. For what it\u2019s worth, where I live, fathers are allowed in the mommy and me classes.", "NTA. As someone who works in public programming we are very intentional about inclusive opportunities, like \u201cmy grown up and me\u201d \u201cparent party\u201d etc.. it\u2019s really not hard to include dad\u2019s, grandparents, foster parents, etc. They\u2019re lazy people and your community deserves better.", "NTA - I think it would have been a much different situation if they gave an explanation as to why it was female only. It also would have been different if they had been willing to offer a compromise (some classes but not all) or a parent and me option. But suggesting that any random woman would be better than the child\u2019s father is not a comprise. I think complaining to city council is appropriate. City council then had their lawyers look into and they likely realized they were liable to be sued and lose so the lawyers told them to shut it down.", "NTA. There really shouldn\u2019t be anything happening with toddlers at a community center that requires a person to have a vagina. Their policy is stupid. They salted the earth instead of being inclusive. Fuck \u2018em.", "NTA. Instead of making the mommy and me classes inclusive the organisers shut it down. You didn't shut it down. They responded to a reasonable request in a ridiculous way.\n\nTBH I'd try and reach out to some of the parents and get the word around that you didn't cause it to be shut down. There's probably a rumour that you did make them close down, so take the opportunity to set the record straight wherever possible. Also the more you meet people and they see that you are a reasonable person, the less the rumour will spread", "NTA. \n\nDiscrimination needs to be called out. You're the girl's parent. Not only women look after children...obviously. Mothers groups need to stop this bullshit.", "NTA. When I think of Mommy and Me activities I think of like, crafts.

That's 100% a true statement and every other single person there could've shoved it because of that.", "NTA\n\nUnless they were having the meetings in the women's change room, it was a reasonable request.

They fucked around by discriminating against single fathers and they got found out.", "NTA.  This is the kind of BS that entrenches sexism.  Dads should be as welcome to a class like that - its healthy for kids to see a man looking after his child.  That is a good thing.  These people are ridiculous.\n\nCan you start your own group?  Maybe get funding from your city?  'Parent and me' classes......then all those other people could potentially have a group again.  And those that don't want dad involved can stay home, or wherever..", "NTA.  OP should look at litigation because his civil rights were still violated.  There was zero added cost for the muni to continue the class when it was determined the admission policy was sexist.  Can you imagine the repercussions if OP was a minority and an all white class was canceled?  \n\nAnd where are the other parents in all this?", "NTA  they should've  known better and shame on them on closing it instead  of just allowing you to come with her. \nThey would be the same ones complaining about   misogyny \nFair is fair all the way around", "NTA. \n\n\nMoving forward... I don't have kids, but my first thought was to wonder if you could look into starting your own \"Play & Learn\" group or something. Could be as simple as reading a book together or playing with blocks or something. Reach out to the preschool, library, YMCA, etc about using a room, and get at least one other parent & kid on board, and advertise the date/time in the newspaper. Then you'll be part of the solution! A group like this may not need require much work or planning after you get the initial meetings running. Good luck!", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, the people at the community center who went nuclear instead of allowing you to bring your daughter to classes are AHs and the adults bullying/encouraging their kids to bully your daughter at daycare are AHs.

The classes may not have worked out, but you are showing her by example to fight for gender equality and that is never a bad thing.", "NTA. Hopefully she\u2019s young enough it all blows over.

This one needs to be resolved before it get worse.", "NTA, and I'm sorry your kid is suffering the consequences of people's ignorance.

There\u2019s no reason why fathers can\u2019t also take their kids to these activities.\n\nI\u2019ve known SAHMs who would only participate in women only activities because their husbands had a problem with them being around other men while they were at work, but this isn\u2019t your problem. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that your kid is receiving backlash for this. Hopefully it blows over soon.", "NTA. They shut it down. You didn't.

Possibly much longer but that was when I started looking.", "NTA\n\nto me that is really stupid that their solution is to cancel the \"Mommy & me\" group instead of allowing you to join. \n\nOr creating a \"daddy & me\" group.", "NTA. Reminds me of the show Workin Moms. A dad is in the mommy and me group and it\u2019s nice to have a male perspective on some issues or for men to get help with raising a daughter when there\u2019s no mom around. Being socialized as a girl is different and it helps to have women around to guide you through things they too have experienced. This was an opportunity for more women and positive energy and a supportive community in your daughters life and instead those women used their kids to bully yours. Not people you want your little girl influenced by anyway so you\u2019re probably dodging a bullet. You didn\u2019t get the classes cancelled they chose to not include you rather than be a welcoming environment. AH behavior.", "NTA you have every right to do things with your daughter that mum's do and to not allow it is sexist and discrimination.", "NTA. With social awareness of minority groups being recognized and accommodating to them, one would assume that Mommy and Me would rebrand as a parenting class that includes any parent/guardian and young child. And as a small town I\u2019m shocked, but maybe my idea of a small town is different from others? My small towns that I\u2019ve lived in were of everyone knows everything about everyone. \n\nIf this class is so important to members then the rebranding has to happen. If it\u2019s to keep mom groups separate from father groups then the fairness needs to be one day a week for each.

Like going to register me he was asked to fill out the paperwork outside because he made the mother's uncomfortable or they felt he shouldn't be in the building.

This summer I was looking for activities for us to do together. The only thing I could find was a series of \"mommy and me\" classes at the community center. I inquired whether I could take her, seeing as she has no mother figure in her life (mother lives in another state and has gone no contact) and was told no. \n\nThat didn't seem fair to me, seeing as this is a small town and there isn't anything else of this nature available, and also this is a city-run community center that is funded by our taxes. So I wrote a polite letter to the head of the community center explaining my situation and asking them to reconsider this policy. She replied back suggesting that I have \"a female relative or neighbor\" bring my daughter to the classes. \n\nThat didn't sit well with me, and I admit I was a bit hot-headed at that point, so I fired off an e-mail to my city council member. He replied that he would \"have our legal counsel look into the matter\".  That was in June, and I didn't hear anything back ever since. \n\nMy daughter started daycare in September due to my work schedule, and she commented that other kids were not treating her nicely.  I thought that was normal for young kids, and told her to ignore it. \n\nFinally, last week a neighbor told me what had happened.  The city determined that not allowing fathers into the classes would violate the law, and instructed the community center to correct this.  They decided to correct it by cancelling the classes, halfway through the summer. They didn't say why (supposedly it was blamed on COVID but I don't think anyone bought that) but eventually the word spread that I was the reason.  \n\nPart of me feels bad right now, but I don't think I did anything wrong. It's not like I sued them, I just complained to the city.  And of course, my daughter is being treated badly by other kids and parents at daycare, and this will probably get worse when she starts actual school.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Terrible.", "..you're telling me that a bunch of preschoolers are so aware of the goings on of 'mommy and me' classes that they're ostracizing your toddler daughter because they know that her dad is the reason these classes got shut down? \n\nLmao this can't be real", "How hard would it have been to just let him take the classes with his child?

I have raised a son pretty much by myself, and I got the icy treatment signing him up and attending Cub scouts, sports, things normally Father/son.

And in this day and age, they were begging for trouble and were lucky they avoided a lawsuit as long as they did.\n\n\nI worked at a swimming pool 20+ years ago that was smart enough to call their babies-based swimming lessons a parent and tot class, because even back then, in a small town, they knew it was wrong to limit the class to parents of one sex if they wanted to retain funding and not get sued.", "Right? I was born in the late 1980s, I had a stay at home father, and he did every single \"Mommy and Me\" class available. Even then, fully 30 years ago, most of them had been renamed to something gender neutral. And I grew up in rural Pennsylvania, hardly a progressive bubble.", "NTA. Exactly. And then people like that will complain about their husbands not lifting a finger for their child, and how men leave everything to the mother", "They should be offering other options anyway. Not everyone is married and cis hetero.", "Welcome to redneck 'murica", "Right? Why did the classes need to be gender specific in the first place?", "A lot of mother and child classes are segregated because many new moms don't feel comfortable around sharing things with men.

No different from any other cult.", "In the US, this is changing. If you say discrimination is part of your religious belief, government can't with hold funding. Religious schools are getting government funding now.", "Don't be so patronizing", "You tell her that daddy is going to take care of it.

Then you go talk to the teachers/the adult supervising/ adult involved. Always show you are taking what she says seriously and follow up with her with what you found and what you have set up to mitigate something like that happening again.

She needs to know you will believe and support her at every avenue and she can come to you with anything, big or small.", "I wouldn\u2019t send your child to do anything. I would go to the daycare supervisor and just mention your daughter seems to be having a hard time with incident A and explain what your daughter told you occurred. Explain that you\u2019re wanting to find a resolution. Your daughter is so young she needs the adult in her life to speak to the adults in charge to make sure she has a safe space. The fact that people are punishing your child when she had no say in any of this is so cruel. (You\u2019re also NTA for wanting to attend a class with your daughter so please don\u2019t take it that way.

Remember that 'Mommy & Me' class you wanted to go to?  Well, I ask if they would let me in with you but they said 'no'. The people that give them money for the toys and snacks told them this was wrong. So, instead of changing the rules, the Mommy & Me class decided to close down. But I guess the mean people think I closed them down. I'm sorry the class doesn't exist anymore... maybe next year they'll call it 'Parent & Me' class and we'll go. But, in the meantime, I'm very sorry people are being mean to you.  A lot of times mean people don't make really good friends but maybe you and I can think of some ways to find some good friends and people.\"\n\nOr something to that effect.

That\u2019s why she\u2019s sitting ALONE.", "Definitely NTA. They should have just opened up the group. I agree that it was a scorched Earth policy to shut it down rather than just opening it up to include fathers. Any reasonable person would see that but the USA elected Donald Trump as president in 2016 so I'm not sure that there are enough reasonable people anymore.", "I live in a small town too, not much for toddlers to do here as well. They have stuff for daddies and daughters, but nothing for like mom and son, so we don\u2019t get to do much. I asked the person in charge of the \u201cDisney princess ball\u201d for ages 2 and up if I could bring my son, and they said it was for daughters only, it sucks that people are like that these days(the lack of boy stuff already sucks) I am sorry they did that to you.

They can have separate gatherings for just women to chat on women stuff and still have the \"parent and child groups\".", "Sure, but the kids of single fathers have the same rights to these community programs as the children with their mothers in their lives.\n\nInstead of a simple but discriminatory policy, clear oversight, staffing, and comprehensive policy should be used to keep everyone comfortable and safe.", "I feel like a support group and a rec center class are way too different to compare. I mean this dude and his child are basically being excluded from public life.\n\nI think it\u2019s more likely that a lot of these classes are female-only to enforce stereotypical gender roles, not protect women.", "Not trying to be an ass but dads aren\u2019t allowed to bond with their babies?
