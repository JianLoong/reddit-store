I asked if everything was okay and she said yes but she didn't want to be at her mom's house anymore and wanted me to pick her up. My husband was working late so I went to pick her up. Her mom didn't want to let me in at first but I eventually got to Maya. She looked horrible. Apparently her mom didn't know any \"natural cures\" for whatever Maya had but thought letting it run its course without any medicine would be healthier than giving her medicine.  \n\nI called my husband and he met us at the house and took her to urgent care. I'm taking some time off of work to take care of her while she recovers.
