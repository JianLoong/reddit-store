Jen's been asking me to come over to Alex's house for dinner with my husband James (29M). She really wants us and her girlfriend to get along better and hasn't let go of this dinner idea. We have a two year old so it took us a while until we were able to manage. But we did accept.\n\nAlexandra is a but different from us. For instance she comes from generational wealth, knows her way around art, is a bit arrogant, etc. However since she makes Jen exceptionally happy, I don't really care. It still sometimes shows that she has had a very different background.\n\nAlexandra's house was huge. James and I were just looking at sculptures, paintings etc. I wanted to be nice, so I asked Alexandra about this painting that she had. She went on to explain who painted that, what it meant, how she bought it, etc. James asked her how much it cost her and she said it was around 140K. \n\nMy eyeballs probably got out of my head because you could easily buy a house with that money! I was so surprised that I said 'holy f##k you paid that much for this thing?' Alexandra did nor appreciate that and said art really didn't have a price and stuff like that.\n\nDuring dinner, I made another one of these comments when I realized the cutlery used at our table were all silver. I was like it's heavier, not comfortable, and they cost god knows what. Alexandra clearly didn't like this comment too because I saw her squeezing Jen's hand a bit but thankfully she didn't say anything.\n\nAfter dinner Jen told me I had embarrassed her with those comments and said she wanted us and Alexandra to bond better not the other way around. She is still upset with me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Jen also is much more comfortable financially but she spends money way more reasonably unlike her gf which is what caught me off guard", "created_utc": 1695374481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p5lqt/aita_for_making_an_inappropriate_comment_when_i/", "score": 2061, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your husband were terrible guests. It is very rude to ask anyone, especially your host, how much something cost. Your response was extraordinarily crass. Your comment about the silverware was also unacceptable. If she inherited wealth, she may have also inherited the cutlery. She may have hauled out great-granny\u2019s silver because she wanted the table to look nice and you responded by insulting her. You owe her and Jen an apology. And if you can\u2019t manage to be polite when you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home, maybe you shouldn\u2019t eat anywhere fancier than McDonald\u2019s.

If you are already in a place where things are clearly ridiculously expensive to you, do not ask how much the host paid for something and be judgmental about it.\n\nShe hosted you and your husband for dinner and to build friendship, not to be made uncomfortable by your judgment of what something should cost or how she should spend her money.", "YTA\n\nThat was kinda rude.", "YTA.

I get all the \"eat the rich\" stuff, but you were just rude and impolite.", "YTA you were rude to someone who invited you into their home.\nYour post makes you seem very snobbish to people who grew up with wealth, like you are better than them. The way you acted shows very well that you are not better than them.", "YTA.\n\nThat's definitely a \"said the quiet bit out loud\" moment - totally agree that spending that much on a painting is absurb but it's not your money so why should you care?", "YTA for making the comment and also the comment about the silverware. James is also an asshole for asking the price of the painting. \n\nYou don\u2019t go to people\u2019s houses and accept their hospitality and then make shitty comments about the prices of their belongings. It\u2019s impolite as fuck.", "There is nothing wrong with being born into generational wealth. No one chooses to be born into particular circumstances. I think YTA and maybe your husband, too. Your husband had no business asking about the cost of the painting, it is rude. Your obvious feelings superiority were showing the whole night. I am not wealthy, but my best friend is. I don\u2019t even ask her how much she pays for things because it is 100% not my business how she spends her money. Although she has luxuries that I do not (and I do not begrudge her this, I am perfectly happy with my life), she also gives significantly more financial support to things I do not spend my money on like charities, her alma maters, and various organizations that she feels have good missions.

Alexandra did nor appreciate that and said art really didn't have a price and stuff like that.\n\nHere is the thing. \n\nAsking the cost of anything, knowing the person is wealthy, is always loaded - with your bias against how they spend their money. \n\nYes, it's a lot to you, and yes, you could buy a house for that much money. You know this, she knows this. She's wealthy and therefore owns expensive art, lives in a large house, and has designer clothes. And? It is very, very rude to point out the obvious to her in her own house and judge her for her money, because you were and are still judging her. \n\nWhat is she supposed to do, give that money away? \n\nShe obviously makes your friend happy.

You should have apologized on the spot for saying something that was clearly not okay. She liked the art, so she bought it, and she wanted to show you it.

At BEST you could maybe have gotten away with commenting on the weight, which would still have been bizarre, but on the cost?  Wtf is wrong with you?   \n\n\n\nFor the record, silver cutlery?  Often not as expensive as you clearly seem to think.  It could easily have been a family set that was passed down, one acquired through thrifting, estate sale hunting, etc.   I grew up in a solidly middle class family and we always used the silver, passed down through my mom\u2019s family, on special occasions like holidays, fancier birthday dinners (meaning like\u2026 not taco night, which mostly just required spoons for the various toppings), etc.  \n\n\n\nHonestly, you and your husband are the arrogant, snobby, classist ones.

To me this is no different than if Alexandra came to your house and said your art was cheap and your cutlery was flimsy and tacky. You don\u2019t go into someone\u2019s home, where they have invited you as a guest, and insult their things - particularly don\u2019t insult them based on their monetary value, high or low.

Why do you think you are qualified to estimate the value of an art piece?", "YTA.\n\nIf these women went into your home, asked what your things cost, and then lamented how cheap, badly made and tacky everything is that would be extraordinarily rude and crass. It is not magically any different because they're rich. What you did was the lowest of bad behavior. And to be clear, you did not embarrass Jen and Alex. They have nothing to be ashamed of. This little stunt humiliated you and James. It is very shameful to be so invasive or haughty in someone else's home.", "YTA. You\u2019re green with envy and judgmental.

You are not superior because you don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 art.

Keep that up and I doubt you'll have a friend much longer.", "YTA. You're giving your unrequested personal opinion about the value of things you clearly have no clue about, and you're stepping it up by saying it's not a reasonable way to spend money.\n\nArt is not only something to look at, it's an investment that may have large returns. Beyond being rude you also come off as stupid. \n\nCongratulations, you hit the Dunning-Kruger jackpot of stupidly confident.", "YTA, you showed very poor manners when confronted with different spending habits and financial priorities. Bite your tongue and be polite to your hosts who did nothing wrong whatsoever?!", "Yikes. If your friend came into your home & commented on how cheap all your junk is, would you not consider that rude? Even if she paid way too much for a painting & has silver cutlery.

Alexandra clearly wants to get to know you and was gracious enough to invite you into her home. Guest/host rules don't change just because of how much someone makes. And frankly it was weird to bring up the thing about the silver at the table. What did you want her to do? Go and change all the cutlery for you? You could've easily kept those comments to yourself. If you really needed to say shit like this, go back home with your husband and talk about it.\n\nAlso why are you only responding to comments that don't paint you as an AH?", "YTA and your husband who doesn\u2019t have manners and courtesy , of course she is from different background so it\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s their money she is buying whatever she wants u don\u2019t need to say that Jen buys stuff reasonably the girls doesn\u2019t. U don\u2019t have any rights to say seriously ur friend Jen should have chosen better friends", "YTA. Why did you think being rude and critical was okay?", "YTA\n\nYour question is \"AITA for making an inappropriate comment when I heard how much a simple painting cost?\" The answer is: yes. You are the asshole.\n\nYou don't have to approve of the wealth, you can certainly be envious of it, but you were rude and judgmental while visiting someone's home. This was rude to your host. This was rude to your friend who brought you along to bond.\n\nDoesn't matter if your dinner is served on fine china with silver cutlery or a chipped plastic cup from Walmart, a good guest shows appreciation and grace to their host. It sounds like she didn't do anything in particular to insult you, you just didn't approve of her spending.", "YTA", "YTA but you're also extremely ignorant. How could you not be the asshole here?", "YTA because this wasn\u2019t about you or even Alexandra. It was about Jen. For reasons I don\u2019t get, she likes you and wants to involve you in her life and she\u2019s trying very hard to do that. You acted like you were raised by wolves and have no concept of normal human interaction. Sometimes when we care about someone in our lives, we go to a concert that isn\u2019t our favorite and say \u201cthat was lovely\u201d even if we were a bit bored or whatever. That\u2019s called being a good friend. You\u2019re a bad friend and you either deliberately caused her discomfort because you don\u2019t approve of her girlfriend, or you have no concept of human behavior.

Also depends on what type of art it was, modern art is often literally a scam or way to do money laundering. If it was a Monet or something than it'd be different. But still 140k for a painting absolutely provokes that reaction in normal people.\n\nWhere I think you actually become an asshole is for cutlery. It's normal to be shocked at that kind of wealth, and not stop some of your reaction, but by the time you were eating surely you got a little used to it and you can refrain comments on silver cutlery, which is not even that rare or expensive", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Jen's been asking me to come over to Alex's house for dinner with my husband James (29M). She really wants us and her girlfriend to get along better and hasn't let go of this dinner idea. We have a two year old so it took us a while until we were able to manage. But we did accept.\n\nAlexandra is a but different from us. For instance she comes from generational wealth, knows her way around art, is a bit arrogant, etc. However since she makes Jen exceptionally happy, I don't really care. It still sometimes shows that she has had a very different background.\n\nAlexandra's house was huge. James and I were just looking at sculptures, paintings etc. I wanted to be nice, so I asked Alexandra about this painting that she had. She went on to explain who painted that, what it meant, how she bought it, etc. James asked her how much it cost her and she said it was around 140K. \n\nMy eyeballs probably got out of my head because you could easily buy a house with that money! I was so surprised that I said 'holy f##k you paid that much for this thing?' Alexandra did nor appreciate that and said art really didn't have a price and stuff like that.\n\nDuring dinner, I made another one of these comments when I realized the cutlery used at our table were all silver. I was like it's heavier, not comfortable, and they cost god knows what. Alexandra clearly didn't like this comment too because I saw her squeezing Jen's hand a bit but thankfully she didn't say anything.\n\nAfter dinner Jen told me I had embarrassed her with those comments and said she wanted us and Alexandra to bond better not the other way around. She is still upset with me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP reeks of jealousy, tbh, and if I were Alexandra, I would tell my gf to not invite these people around again. \n\nBlows my mind that people ITT, are calling OP NTA!!! \u201cShe\u2019s rich, she\u2019ll live\u201d etc comments, show just how jealous these commenters are too.", "I love to brag when I get good deals lol. You see it all the time like on subs like Thrift Store Hauls. Everyone in my circle would be shocked if anyone spent 140k on a painting and honestly I would never even if I was stupidly rich. So that would never even be a worry. I love to support small local artists at art fairs instead.\n Some Silver I inherited and some I got at a flea market. I would have bragged if OP brought it up and would offer to maybe go look for pieces thrifting. I don't find money taboo. Hell I have been discussing the hell we have of replacing a full septic system and that cost! I wouldn't say anything to the friend's GF's  face, but would be definitely talking on the way home. I personally cant stand spending like that.", "Some people are just weird and it shows, especially on the net where you can get away with things.\n\nI am glad the top comment is yta though.", "Same."]}
