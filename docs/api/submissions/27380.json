Jen's been asking me to come over to Alex's house for dinner with my husband James (29M). She really wants us and her girlfriend to get along better and hasn't let go of this dinner idea. We have a two year old so it took us a while until we were able to manage. But we did accept.\n\nAlexandra is a but different from us. For instance she comes from generational wealth, knows her way around art, is a bit arrogant, etc. However since she makes Jen exceptionally happy, I don't really care. It still sometimes shows that she has had a very different background.\n\nAlexandra's house was huge. James and I were just looking at sculptures, paintings etc. I wanted to be nice, so I asked Alexandra about this painting that she had. She went on to explain who painted that, what it meant, how she bought it, etc. James asked her how much it cost her and she said it was around 140K. \n\nMy eyeballs probably got out of my head because you could easily buy a house with that money! I was so surprised that I said 'holy f##k you paid that much for this thing?' Alexandra did nor appreciate that and said art really didn't have a price and stuff like that.\n\nDuring dinner, I made another one of these comments when I realized the cutlery used at our table were all silver. I was like it's heavier, not comfortable, and they cost god knows what. Alexandra clearly didn't like this comment too because I saw her squeezing Jen's hand a bit but thankfully she didn't say anything.\n\nAfter dinner Jen told me I had embarrassed her with those comments and said she wanted us and Alexandra to bond better not the other way around. She is still upset with me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Jen also is much more comfortable financially but she spends money way more reasonably unlike her gf which is what caught me off guard", "created_utc": 1695374481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p5lqt/aita_for_making_an_inappropriate_comment_when_i/", "score": 244, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your husband were terrible guests. It is very rude to ask anyone, especially your host, how much something cost. Your response was extraordinarily crass. Your comment about the silverware was also unacceptable. If she inherited wealth, she may have also inherited the cutlery. She may have hauled out great-granny\u2019s silver because she wanted the table to look nice and you responded by insulting her. You owe her and Jen an apology.

If you are already in a place where things are clearly ridiculously expensive to you, do not ask how much the host paid for something and be judgmental about it.\n\nShe hosted you and your husband for dinner and to build friendship, not to be made uncomfortable by your judgment of what something should cost or how she should spend her money.", "YTA\n\nThat was kinda rude.", "YTA.

James is also an asshole for asking the price of the painting. \n\nYou don\u2019t go to people\u2019s houses and accept their hospitality and then make shitty comments about the prices of their belongings. It\u2019s impolite as fuck.", "There is nothing wrong with being born into generational wealth. No one chooses to be born into particular circumstances. I think YTA and maybe your husband, too.

I don\u2019t even ask her how much she pays for things because it is 100% not my business how she spends her money. Although she has luxuries that I do not (and I do not begrudge her this, I am perfectly happy with my life), she also gives significantly more financial support to things I do not spend my money on like charities, her alma maters, and various organizations that she feels have good missions.

Alexandra did nor appreciate that and said art really didn't have a price and stuff like that.\n\nHere is the thing. \n\nAsking the cost of anything, knowing the person is wealthy, is always loaded - with your bias against how they spend their money. \n\nYes, it's a lot to you, and yes, you could buy a house for that much money. You know this, she knows this. She's wealthy and therefore owns expensive art, lives in a large house, and has designer clothes. And? It is very, very rude to point out the obvious to her in her own house and judge her for her money, because you were and are still judging her. \n\nWhat is she supposed to do, give that money away? \n\nShe obviously makes your friend happy.

You should have apologized on the spot for saying something that was clearly not okay. She liked the art, so she bought it, and she wanted to show you it.

At BEST you could maybe have gotten away with commenting on the weight, which would still have been bizarre, but on the cost?  Wtf is wrong with you?   \n\n\n\nFor the record, silver cutlery?  Often not as expensive as you clearly seem to think.  It could easily have been a family set that was passed down, one acquired through thrifting, estate sale hunting, etc.   I grew up in a solidly middle class family and we always used the silver, passed down through my mom\u2019s family, on special occasions like holidays, fancier birthday dinners (meaning like\u2026 not taco night, which mostly just required spoons for the various toppings), etc.  \n\n\n\nHonestly, you and your husband are the arrogant, snobby, classist ones.

To me this is no different than if Alexandra came to your house and said your art was cheap and your cutlery was flimsy and tacky. You don\u2019t go into someone\u2019s home, where they have invited you as a guest, and insult their things - particularly don\u2019t insult them based on their monetary value, high or low.

Why do you think you are qualified to estimate the value of an art piece?", "YTA.\n\nIf these women went into your home, asked what your things cost, and then lamented how cheap, badly made and tacky everything is that would be extraordinarily rude and crass. It is not magically any different because they're rich. What you did was the lowest of bad behavior. And to be clear, you did not embarrass Jen and Alex. They have nothing to be ashamed of. This little stunt humiliated you and James. It is very shameful to be so invasive or haughty in someone else's home.", "YTA. You\u2019re green with envy and judgmental.

You are not superior because you don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 art.

Keep that up and I doubt you'll have a friend much longer.", "YTA. You're giving your unrequested personal opinion about the value of things you clearly have no clue about, and you're stepping it up by saying it's not a reasonable way to spend money.\n\nArt is not only something to look at, it's an investment that may have large returns. Beyond being rude you also come off as stupid. \n\nCongratulations, you hit the Dunning-Kruger jackpot of stupidly confident.", "YTA, you showed very poor manners when confronted with different spending habits and financial priorities. Bite your tongue and be polite to your hosts who did nothing wrong whatsoever?!", "Yikes. If your friend came into your home & commented on how cheap all your junk is, would you not consider that rude? Even if she paid way too much for a painting & has silver cutlery.

Alexandra clearly wants to get to know you and was gracious enough to invite you into her home. Guest/host rules don't change just because of how much someone makes. And frankly it was weird to bring up the thing about the silver at the table. What did you want her to do? Go and change all the cutlery for you? You could've easily kept those comments to yourself. If you really needed to say shit like this, go back home with your husband and talk about it.\n\nAlso why are you only responding to comments that don't paint you as an AH?", "YTA and your husband who doesn\u2019t have manners and courtesy , of course she is from different background so it\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s their money she is buying whatever she wants u don\u2019t need to say that Jen buys stuff reasonably the girls doesn\u2019t. U don\u2019t have any rights to say seriously ur friend Jen should have chosen better friends", "YTA. Why did you think being rude and critical was okay?", "YTA\n\nYour question is \"AITA for making an inappropriate comment when I heard how much a simple painting cost?\" The answer is: yes. You are the asshole.\n\nYou don't have to approve of the wealth, you can certainly be envious of it, but you were rude and judgmental while visiting someone's home. This was rude to your host. This was rude to your friend who brought you along to bond.\n\nDoesn't matter if your dinner is served on fine china with silver cutlery or a chipped plastic cup from Walmart, a good guest shows appreciation and grace to their host. It sounds like she didn't do anything in particular to insult you, you just didn't approve of her spending.", "YTA", "YTA but you're also extremely ignorant. How could you not be the asshole here?", "YTA because this wasn\u2019t about you or even Alexandra. It was about Jen. For reasons I don\u2019t get, she likes you and wants to involve you in her life and she\u2019s trying very hard to do that. You acted like you were raised by wolves and have no concept of normal human interaction. Sometimes when we care about someone in our lives, we go to a concert that isn\u2019t our favorite and say \u201cthat was lovely\u201d even if we were a bit bored or whatever. That\u2019s called being a good friend. You\u2019re a bad friend and you either deliberately caused her discomfort because you don\u2019t approve of her girlfriend, or you have no concept of human behavior.

Also depends on what type of art it was, modern art is often literally a scam or way to do money laundering. If it was a Monet or something than it'd be different. But still 140k for a painting absolutely provokes that reaction in normal people.\n\nWhere I think you actually become an asshole is for cutlery. It's normal to be shocked at that kind of wealth, and not stop some of your reaction, but by the time you were eating surely you got a little used to it and you can refrain comments on silver cutlery, which is not even that rare or expensive", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Jen's been asking me to come over to Alex's house for dinner with my husband James (29M). She really wants us and her girlfriend to get along better and hasn't let go of this dinner idea. We have a two year old so it took us a while until we were able to manage. But we did accept.\n\nAlexandra is a but different from us. For instance she comes from generational wealth, knows her way around art, is a bit arrogant, etc. However since she makes Jen exceptionally happy, I don't really care. It still sometimes shows that she has had a very different background.\n\nAlexandra's house was huge. James and I were just looking at sculptures, paintings etc. I wanted to be nice, so I asked Alexandra about this painting that she had. She went on to explain who painted that, what it meant, how she bought it, etc. James asked her how much it cost her and she said it was around 140K. \n\nMy eyeballs probably got out of my head because you could easily buy a house with that money! I was so surprised that I said 'holy f##k you paid that much for this thing?' Alexandra did nor appreciate that and said art really didn't have a price and stuff like that.\n\nDuring dinner, I made another one of these comments when I realized the cutlery used at our table were all silver. I was like it's heavier, not comfortable, and they cost god knows what. Alexandra clearly didn't like this comment too because I saw her squeezing Jen's hand a bit but thankfully she didn't say anything.\n\nAfter dinner Jen told me I had embarrassed her with those comments and said she wanted us and Alexandra to bond better not the other way around. She is still upset with me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your husband specifically asked her (which is invasive, by the way) and that's why she answered.", "I'm not saying they weren't rude, but culture shock is a thing, and people sometimes blurt out inappropriate comments when they're overwhelmed. It sounds like it wasn't malicious so much as surprise.", "Incompetent thieves? Although I'm not accusing OP, she just sounds young and unaccustomed to rich people.", "You often see it on AITA; people who have money / qualifications / status are viewed as being arrogant by default by people who are TA. I feel like I've experienced this on a smaller scale in my own life (a smaller scale because I don't have much status!)", "Well said I agree. Hell I've done it as a young, not very emotionally mature young man.", "And I'll point out that both art and silverware can be assets as well as consumables. Most art loses value, but so does money and a 140k painting might be worth more or less in the future but will likely be worth something for a while, and while you could buy a house for that houses take more maintenance and it sounds like she already has a house. And silverware holds it's value well enough that England measured wealth in Pounds of Sterling.", "But also (minor quibble) silver is lighter than stainless steel, so I\u2019m not sure why it would feel so heavy to OP? \n\nOP is 100% TA, but this stuck out to me as an extra weird comment.", "I have literally never once in my life cared when somebody asked me that. Feels like you need to be a bit of a weirdo to get upset about that rather than just answering it and moving on.", "And then to decide something bought it\u2019s not with SOMEONE ELSE\u2019s money! It\u2019s NONE of their business because it\u2019s NOT their money to spend!", "This seems to be mostly a thing in circles of older generations. I would be fine with asking how much something costs to one of my friends because I might want to buy something like it or I\u2019m just curious but when my parents talk to people they act like money is Voldemort", "The only people who think it\u2019s rude to talk about money, are people with money.", "I think the rude thing was the reaction to the answer more than the question itself. One coul just open their eyes and go like damn and leave it at that.\n\nNo need to do more remarks on cutlery as well.\n\nThey rich, you mad?!", "For the most part, I agree here. \n\nBut, I think whenever peeps from different social classes socialise it\u2019s a joint endeavour in being polite. Each party needs to be looking for safer ground, and assessing how to get there.\n\nI don\u2019t from OPs post get a sense Alexandra was doing amazing from her side either. Cross class communication, awareness, and being aware of codes and code switching doesn\u2019t come easy to anyone without experience and talking to people from a different class culture. I\u2019m not sure this is really anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just both parties were working at cross purposes with different expectations.", "Yall seem tad sensitive if thats such inappropriate question without being Led onto asking it by them bragging first", "Asking strangers about costs of things is seen as rude but I think asking people you know is different. My friends and I ask each other what things they bought cost, all the time. I don't think the question is rude, the way OP reacted to the answer tho wasn't ideal. But even that as a single comment I could have understood because that really is a shit ton of money for a painting but then keeping up the passive aggressive comments made them assholes.\n\nMy boyfriend has a friend that comes from money and she says she can't really be offended if people are curious and she gets that their first reaction to expensive things can be \"holy shit that's a lot of money\". She doesn't see it as disrespect because she herself has been to peoples homes even richer than her parents and she herself is then in the same kind of situation.", "It is though. It\u2019s nosy and puts them on the spot. They can volunteer how much they paid if they choose to, but that\u2019s often rude as well.", "Or you could not be a psychopath and feed 1000s of people with that money.", "The entire concept of \u201cthat behaviour is gauche\u201d is pretty much the pretentious preserve of the wealthy, most normal people are comfortable enough to ask the price of things because unless you\u2019re super rich, money matters", "How the fuck do you come up with a reply like this?", "I think the implication is in admitting that price and not feeling sheepish about it or explaining that purchasing it required a big financial sacrifice or something.", "What good came of it? None. Jen's friends don't want to see her rich gf or her rich gf's house. Jen should have considered how it would look/feel for her friends who are young new parents to be in this environment where someone has ten times what they ever will, without working for it, at a time in their life when things are really damn expensive. I don't doubt for a second that Jen invited them to Alex's house instead of her own place specifically to show off, and it backfired. Jen is clearly not as well-mannered as she thinks she is.", "It\u2019s hard to admit you want to be them, and much easier to try to tear them down with judgy comments.", "You can be insecure and not be a rude AH like the OP\n\nNice try though with the shallow justification", "The only thing genuine is their insecurity. If they can\u2019t handle the price tag, simply don\u2019t ask.", "Right? Everybody in this thread is acting like that's not crazy. Like sure, OP went about it rudely, but that's not right.", "First of all I'm being aggressive because a bunch of weirdos with absolutely no social lives are calling op an asshole for being rude when in all reality that's just how normal people act, which you would know if you left your basement more than once a year. \n\nSecondly, I have plenty of manners, I'm a house cleaner and most of our clients are wealthy people so I know how to interact with them (and I've never been called rude for asking the price of something). But you will never experience those manners because you're nobody to me. \n\nLastly, we're not your fucking servants, we're not required to sit down and shut up if we encounter an issue. If she wants to make a comment about their silverware online to validate it was real silver then that's her prerogative. And I'd suggest you reread that part because your reading comprehension is absolute shit.", "Just because someone is rich doesn't mean they have to be hated. In this particular case i respect the person who didn't insult the host and didn't asked rude questions. Poor people can be awful too, it's not like just because they're poor they always have to be defended.", "Then don\u2019t accept their invitation to dinner, bro.", "You should respect the person hosting you for dinner regardless of their economic background.", "Yeah, don't respect your friend's partner! /s", "Do you vocalize every thought that enters your head? OP can think whatever she wants, but that doesn't mean she has to say it out loud to the host.", ">It's okay to feel a bit of shame for the money we waste on stuff we don't need,\n\nI'm going to disagree, I don't need to feel shame for buying things that go beyond basic necessities.", "Right? As of right now we are at 180 YTAs and this is the only one he actually responded too. Very telling. Also further proving Alexandria is not the arrogant one.", "More than one", "If OP hadn't opened with talking down about her (calling her arrogant, etc) it might be a bit easier to give them room for being \"shocked\".\n\nFrom the sound of it, she put out the good stuff to try and make a good impression, and instead of recognizing that, OP called it heavy and uncomfortable to use. \n\nSilver is a pain to care for: I have my great grandma's and only bring it out for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and very special events. The fact that OP got the white glove treatment and threw it back at the host like an insult is really unkind.", "Hahaha maybe Jen knew that too and it was actually OPs ignorance that embarrassed her.", "Just because you don't care doesn't mean everyone doesn't. I was brought up with the rule that you don't ask questions like that, and the questioner is looked at as rude and low class. If someone asks me how much something cost i tell them it's none of their business.", "I personally wouldn\u2019t care if someone asked me. It\u2019s still rude though. I definitely wouldn\u2019t ask someone that.", "I'm not sure how old you are but as a millennial my eyebrows would certainly have raised at the husband's question. OP's follow up was certainly more overtly rude though.", "Well, yeah, but you're not going to be asking your friend you know is rich how much she spent for some antique art because 1) you can't get that item yourself and 2) you know it's probably stupid high\n\nThis isn't like \"oh, cute shoes, I might want a pair\" like it's a painting...", "I\u2019m a millennial and find it incredibly gauche. Money goes with religion, sex and politics in the basket of \u201cthings to not discuss with relative strangers.\u201d", "I think the difference here is that you ask friends, not acquaintances. \n\nAnd I mean especially art, everyone knows rich people pay an obscene ammount of money for paintings and stuff. It just sounds like they wanted to make a big deal about it.", "Friends is the keyword, this is not your friend this is the partner of your friend you don't know very well and you already have a bit of an issue with because you consider them arrogant and privileged.\nWhy would you bring up money in a situation when money is a thing you feel already separates you and makes you uncomfortable.\nAt that point you are actively looking to have an issue.\n(by you I mean a hypothetical you, not you as a person)", "It may be a generational thing to ask but the reaction to the answer is universally rude in this case.", "they didn't ask her friend though,  they asked a relative stranger.\n\n\\>>'holy f##k you paid that much for this thing?'\n\nand phrased it in a way that showed she thought it wasn't worth the money", "So - here is the thing. It's a bit about tact. \n\nI would ask my friends who I am pretty sure have similar incomes / wealth as me what something would cost, especially if it was something I might consider for my own home. And I'm happy to share that information in a similar situation. \n\nI wouldn't ask someone who CLEARLY has more money than me what it costs. Because I KNOW the answer is going to be some amount that unfeasible for me, and it's going to make the person being asked uncomfortable to have to reveal so starkly our wealth differences.\n\nFor example - I'd ask my friend who just bought a new Nissan what they paid - because I can reasonably expect its a number I could afford or would not seem extreme. I wouldn't ask my friend who just bought a new Porche what they paid - because it's just going to be uncomfortable for everyone.", "I think the problem is not asking but judging how someone spends their money.", "One of my friends, yes, I would have no problem asking.

Nope.", "Same, but OP just met this woman for the first time. \n\n> friends \n\nbeing the operative word", "OP and this woman aren't really friends yet though.\n\nI would definitely ask my friends what a thing cost (always with \"if you don't mind my asking\" appended), but I wouldn't ask an acquaintance that, particularly if they were hosting, unless it was already an active part of the conversation.\n\nI guess at 39 I might be an \"older generation\" now though x\\_x", "I don't think asking the price of something is generally rude. However, knowing the person has money then it feels like the question was asked just to judge how much they paid for it. \n\nDisliking someone just because they have money. \n\nRemove the fact that they do have money. \n\nYou insulted something in thier home and are then asking if you're the AH. \n\nYes, yes you are.", ">Asking strangers about costs of things is seen as rude but I think asking people you know is different.\u00a0\n\nThis was the first time they were meeting Alexandra", "But she probably wouldn't ask those richer people how much something cost in that situation.", "Asking people you know is not different unless you specifically know the person is on the same page as you.", "How the fuck you come up with a statement like that while ignoring all the historical reasons some people did better than others? Stupid and ignorant", "Alexandra went into a detailed description of the artwork, and its acquisition. That sounds like a carefully considered purchase, not something that was casually thrown into the shopping basket at an auction.", "True. I always find that weak people try to tear strong people down because they're insecure. I always use rufus humprey/lily van der woodsen as an exemple for this.", "They did handle it\u2026 Pointing out how expensive the art was is a natural reaction. Most people, who aren\u2019t wealthy, would react the same", "If you are surprised someone from generational wealth invests money in art you have led an incredibly sheltered life", "One of the leadership team in my company met with my staff at our location. He apparently was wearing a $15,000 jacket. Someone on the team quietly googled it and mentioned it AFTER HE LEFT. It\u2019s crazy to spend that on a jacket. we all know it\u2019s crazy, but that doesn\u2019t mean we need to comment about it to him. It\u2019s not our business. No one is acting like the cost of the painting isn\u2019t crazy,  it\u2019s it\u2019s that\u2026.it is what it is. And it\u2019s not neccesary to comment on it to the owner. Sometimes in life you meet people that have significantly more or less than you. You gotta be a polite grown up about it.", "Well where I\u2019m from there are levels to being polite. Like omg that\u2019s amazing I can\u2019t believe you created that. And omg I can\u2019t believe you had that appraised at that level and avoided taxes. I guess it depends on how you determine polite", "Or a cultural thing, I wouldn't think twice if someone asked me the price I would just answer honestly.\n\nBut I work hard for my money so iam often proud of showing off something I saved for that is of quality.\n\nI would say NAH really", "Millennial here and I don\u2019t see a problem with asking about money. I\u2019m a pretty open book; I don\u2019t see people I\u2019m close with being offended or afraid to ask me either. It\u2019s a ridiculous thing to care about so much. \n\nIn this case, I wouldn\u2019t consider what these people asked rude if we were close or knew each other more at least. But being a stranger and then the \u201choly crap/this thing\u201d comments are rude. Idk about the silverware.. I wouldn\u2019t be commenting in regards to money or what it\u2019s made of but if they really are that heavy it\u2019s hard to eat, that may be a problem.", "Interesting. I am a millennial and don\u2019t find it rude or strange at all. I think discussing money can be very educational for all. In fact it always surprises my parents when my friends and I talk about our incomes or how much we have in savings. But it\u2019s a way for all of us to learn more IMO", "Exactly. These people can't see the difference between asking how much a pair of shoes cost and asking how much their rich friend's Aston Martin cost them? Its absolutely an uncomfortable question. They're not oblivious. They are likely quite aware that you are not wealthy. Repeatedly saying the things OP said is showing envy. You think that doesn't make someone uncomfortable in their own home? Save that for someone who has given you a reason to be an asshole and you don't care if they never speak to you again.", "Absolutely, just pointing out something I noticed", "It wasn't. OP already had an opinion on Alexandra's behaviour, and Jen expressed that she wanted them to get along better. It sounds like they've met and gotten off on the wrong foot before.", "Oh she does. What I find funny is that rich people talk way more openly about what things cost them. At least the ones I met.", "I didn't even make a statement.

I've also never visited a place where that would be considered part of polite discourse, and I've visited some places where the people can be very blunt.", "Oh my bad...I truly do not think that backstory points to a relationship where this kind of question would be perceived well but idk why I thought they hadn't met", "Ok but I think we can agree that they are not friends with Alexandra nor do they know her well.", "Honestly this is one of the less crazy things. Art has value and can be traded. Why else is it such a favorite for money laundering? And silver cutlery isn\u2019t all that expensive in the grand scale either. \n\nWhat OP described is reasonable. Its not a waste of money. Sure cheaper stuff would do too, but its not burning money. Its all stuff that will keep or even increase its value and can be passed down", "What to you is more offensive? Dodging taxes via over appreciated art? Or a person\u2019s reaction to over appreciated art?", "Oh yeah, I absolutely agree. If you're trying to redo a first impression, you should ACT like you've never met, and that you really need this stranger to like you."]}
