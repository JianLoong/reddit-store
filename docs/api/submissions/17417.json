I try my very best to hide it. \n\nI\u2019ve never had real friends. I\u2019ve always been a loner. But about a year ago, I got adopted by a small group of extroverts. We\u2019ve been growing close ever since. I\u2019m even slowly branching out and talking to a boy I like. Things are going well. \n\nLast week I had my first meltdown in front of them. It\u2019s all a blur, but I got so overwhelmed with the talking and lights and heat and everything else, so I just broke down. I remember crying really hard. There were hands on me trying to make me stop shaking, so I threw myself backwards into a wall. I think I screamed a lot. \n\nEveryone was in a panic, but I just wanted them to stop. I ran off and locked myself in my friend\u2019s bedroom. They all followed me and crowded the door. I just cried on the floor for what must have been an hour. \n\nWhen things felt okay again, I quickly grabbed my things and slipped out before they could notice. \n\nThe next day, I had 72 missed calls and over a hundred texts. I found out the next day that when I didn\u2019t reply, one of the girls I\u2019m closest to called my sister. My sister told them all my secrets, my diagnosis and why I acted that way. \n\nI feel really betrayed. Betrayed by my sister, and even worse, the group is a little mad at me for hiding it. They say I should have told them. Something about being honest and open and not keeping secrets. I feel like I failed them. I feel like a fraud and haven\u2019t talked to them in a few days now. I\u2019m so embarrassed. AITA?", "created_utc": 1684267428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jfm6y/aita_for_hiding_my_diagnosis/", "score": 2565, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a hard one.  I'm going to give a gentle YTA.  Note, I am also autistic, so I get it.  I do.  And it's totally fine to not walk around wearing a nameplate that says \"Hi, I'm autistic.\"\n\nBut...a year?  It never had a chance to come up once?  And these are your friends?  Did your sister know they didn't know?\n\nAnd, I know it isn't a life-threatening condition, but *it is* something that has significant side effects that can be triggered at almost anytime.  If you had a more serious condition, like siezures or a food allergy, would you actively hide it?  You put your friends in a position where you needed something specific to assist in your medical condition and they were completely blindsided.  They were so worried about you, they reached out to your family.\n\nI wouldn't let the anxiety build to bridge burning, I think an honest apology is due to your friends and an (very understandable) admittance of you hiding it out of fear of rejection.", "Gentle YTA - Don't you think the meltdown maybe gave it away? Of course they would be concerned and want to know what happened. You should have provided at least some kind of explanation after, then you would have been in control of the message. \n\nFriends care about each other.", "Your friends seem great. Their actions tell me that they wanted to help and were worried about you. Kudos to them for reaching out to you. A lot of people would not have texted and called you so many times. Your sister messed up big time and is another story.\n\nI suggest you reach out to your friends, explain what you stated above and ask for their forgiveness for not knowing how to handle the situation. They are your first real friends, you were embarrassed and did not know what to say or how to tell them. True friends, even when hurt, will understand and forgive mistakes. \n\nI wish you well and hope that they are true life long friends for you. We all need them.", "Soft YTA. You never had friends before so you didn't really know how to behave. Plus: it's your business and you should be allowed to share when and if you feel like it.\n\nBUT you knew you could have had meltdowns in front of them, so it's been a little risky of you to act like this and they deserve an apology.\n\nWish you good luck \ud83d\udc93", "Gentle YTA-- if you were at risk of a meltdown that incapacitated you, you should have told them. I understand wanting to be seen as \"normal\", but there's nothing shameful about sharing a diagnosis with people who care about you. All it does is better equip them to understand and care for you.\n\nThey didn't know if you were having a panic attack, an allergy attack, a seizure, a heart attack, an aneurysm-- any number of very scary things could have been happening. If they had known ahead of time what to do, this could have been a much easier experience for you.\n\nUnderstand that *they* are likely feeling ashamed right now for not knowing. They're probably feeling like if only they'd known, they could have been better friends or better supporters, and they're wondering if they really knew you as well as they thought.\n\nAll that said-- you're not a fraud or a failure. You shouldn't feel ashamed. \n\nYou also shouldn't keep hiding, as that's likely compounding the issue. Just talk to them. Tell them what happened, and tell them why you didn't disclose your diagnosis earlier. Apologize for not taking into account that they might be forced to find out in a traumatic way, and for not realizing they would feel lied to. \n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of shame around your diagnosis and its effect on your earlier life, and I encourage you to open up to them about it. Tell them that you didn't want to be treated differently and you still don't. Hopefully this is something that can be overcome within your group with minimal change to your overall dynamics.", "You do yourself a disservice by hiding your diagnosis. I does not make you unlikeable, it would take stress off you, and would explain or they can help prevent meltdowns.", "I don't think you are wrong to share your medical information as you see fit.  However, I think if at risk of behavior such as this, you should have informed your friends.  That is super scary and concerning to witness and they could have called medical support.  Plus, you locked yourself in someone else's room.  I think you should speak to a counselor and work with a behaviorist for ways to deescalate your behavior.  I do think they have the right to be upset over how you acted.  I would say, while accidental, YTA for not having better-coping methods.", "Gentle YTA. I get wanting to hide it with the stigma surrounding it but that honestly won\u2019t work well with friends/family for this exact reason.\n\nQuick story: to this day I still don\u2019t know why it happened, but from 20-28ish years old, I would have panic attacks during sex. No warning, no reason I could ever figure out, I\u2019d be having a great time and next thing I know I\u2019m pushing the guy off to curl into the fetal position and hyperventilate. So, I started warning potential partners about it. Told them it\u2019s a possibility and what they could do if it happens since the odds were good I wouldn\u2019t be able to communicate in that moment. Did it suck? Obviously, it wasn\u2019t great but it was a reality of my life and pretending it didn\u2019t exist wasn\u2019t going to help anyone.", "NAH. Of course it's scary to share a diagnosis with your friends. Of course, they are going to be worried for you when they see you having a breakdown.\n\nAnd OF COURSE, they are going to feel inadequate when they realise that you didn't trust them enough to share your secrets with them.\n\nYou didn't fail anything. You are not a fraud. You are just trying to do you best, and you just learned a nice life lessons : your friends love you and they care about you.", "You know, you're very lucky that your friends didn't call emergency services due to what must have looked like a psychiatric episode. You're lucky you didn't get put on involuntary hold in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nNAH, but understand that you're not doing yourself any favours by not letting people know how to properly support your condition.", "Everyone saying the sister is the asshole, I'm not so sure.\n\nI'm trying to paint a picture and put myself in the place of the friends and the sister, \n\nNot knowing that the op was autistic, the friends were extremely concerned by the behavior, they could have thought it was a medical emergency, a full blown psychiatric breakdown, and then suddenly she had gone missing, they were so concerned that they reached out to Ops sister for help. \n\nI can just imagine being the sister and getting that phone call, hearing the panic in their voices that they must be experiencing, I for one don't know would I have the mental capacity to pause and think, I know, I must protect my sister's private medical information here. \n\nI think my reaction would be more likely, hey friends, calm down, tell me what happened, no listen everything is ok, you don't need to worry, or call the police or go looking for her, she's actually autistic and this sounds like she got overwhelmed or over stimulated, it happens occasionally and she's going to be ok soon so you can take a deep breath and stop panicking \n\nSorry op, you are slightly TA, it is totally your choice when you tell people your private medical information, but at a certain point you have to open up to friends and trust them.", "Main thing out of the way: you didn\u2019t fail anyone. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. If your friends are real friends they will understand that. It sounds like they do.\n\nYou have a condition that, for you, means you not only navigate the world in a unique way but you are also prone to meltdowns. Meltdowns are understandably scary for you but they are also scary for the people around you. \n\nOn the one hand it\u2019s your right to disclose or not disclose medical information. On the other, your diagnosis puts you in a position where your medical condition affects other people. Not only do they not know how to help you but there\u2019s a chance they could accidentally be injured. There\u2019s also the concern that with what your meltdown looks like from the outside - it likely looked scary and dangerous, and your friends had no context for the severity.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t want to let them know about your autism I think it would have been best to just prep them about the meltdowns - \u201cHey, it\u2019s not a big deal, but on rare occasions this happens. Here\u2019s what\u2019s best to do.\u201d However, that\u2019s easy to say from the outside.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t condone what your sister did I don\u2019t blame her for misstepping while trying to reassure people who clearly care a lot about you.\n\nNow that everyone knows give them a chance to be good friends. You do yourself a disservice by closing down these relationships- they haven\u2019t shown any confirmation that they are judging you. \n\nDon\u2019t punish yourself for being yourself.", "Tentative NAH. Your personal medical information is personal. It is your right to decide who knows and when. \n\nBut your friend group was probably just scared. It isn't fun watching a friend suffer and not knowing what's going on or how you can help. \n\nI would reach back out to them, apologize without taking blame, explain that your decision to keep your diagnosis private was not intended to hurt them, and see if they're cool to keep hanging out. (If you want help with a script for this, lmk!)\n\nIf they're cool, great! If they want to hold this over you, or treat you differently after this... less great. I know it can be hard to make friends. But don't eat gravel just cuz you're hungry.", "Gentle YTA. While I\u2019m not autistic, I do have Bipolar disorder and have had to explain this to new friends/partners/employers because it can have an effect on the people around you. Aside from the fact that it offers an explanation for things that might otherwise be confusing for those not in the loop, it also can help dictate how people respond and the aftercare that you receive. Does it suck when people find out and treat you different? Sure, but at the same time it isn\u2019t as common as you think (in my personal experience, I can\u2019t speak for others) and truly if someone is gonna treat you worse because you\u2019re disabled, you\u2019re better off without them", "Yta\u2026theyre supposed to see that and NOT wonder wtf is going on? You could be having a bad drug reaction, psychotic break or anything. A grown woman randomly screaming and crying is by no means normal so of course they want you to give some indication of what happened and if youre okay. I\u2019d be scared you may fight me or something insane.", "NAH\n\nThis was new for you - to be in a group. One of the expectations is sharing important things that affect you but also, could affect them. \n\nImagine from their point of view - sudden breakdown. Extreme if you have not seen it before. I only recently witnessed a panic attack and it did not at all look like panic, I'd have no idea that's what it was. \n\nAnyhow, you do need to own up that you put them through something quite shocking but they still know and like you for who you are ... if you open up to them and share the rest of who you are. If you just get upset like it's everyone else's fault that mostly penalizes you.\n\nAnyhow. Your sister was not wrong to share your situation bc they were probably really scared and worried about you.", "I think you need to talk to them. They sound really caring, even if it isn\u2019t in a way that was helpful at the time. I think talking to them about being overstimulated and what would help you in that state is called for. They were concerned enough to talk to your sister. You haven\u2019t failed them. It\u2019s very relatable to not want to be defined by your diagnosis, especially one that can be very misunderstood. But if your friends had known, they could have helped you.", "Personally I have to go with NTA. As I can never fault someone for choosing not to disclose their medical diagnosis. However speaking as a fellow Autistic, I do have to ask why you are so embarrassed about your diagnosis?\n\nI don't think you have any obligation to disclose, though I do worry that you may be internalizing a lot of self destructive beliefs around your being Autistic that may impact your relationships with your friends. \n\nIt might benefit your relationships to consider opening up to your friends, and talking to them about your diagnosis.\n\nI have to say though that your sister choosing to disclose your medical diagnosis without your consent is an extremely inappropriate thing to do. Especially given that I'm assuming she's aware of your desire to keep that information private. That is a massive violation of your trust, and your privacy.", "Sorry to break it to you, but yes. YTA. You didn't have to tell your friend group right off the bat about your diagnosis, but once you started getting close you really should have. There's nothing shameful about your situation. However, your friends really needed to be aware for your sake as demonstrated here. They had no idea that you could be triggered into a meltdown from the lights, noise, heat etc. Once you were they were scared/concerned for you and tried to help having no idea what was wrong or that their responses were making it worse. Then you ghosted everyone after ignoring all attempts to find out if you were okay. They were scared. They were worried. They were concerned.  They're also upset you didn't trust them enough to give them the information they needed to know what was going on, why, or how to help. These are your friends but you didn't treat them like it. I'm sure they're also hurt by your lack of trust.", "NAH. It\u2019s your choice to disclose your diagnosis. If your sister knew you were keeping it a secret, then she\u2019s TA for sharing. Something to think about though is that if your friends knew about your diagnosis, then you could have had a conversation with them about how they can support you during meltdowns etc. It seems like you\u2019re really only doing yourself a disservice in this instance though. Again, it\u2019s your choice to share though.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. They were always gonna worry though and send lots of messages. Once you\u2019re back within the window of tolerance try and let people know you\u2019re okay (if you can in future, I know it isn\u2019t always easy or possible). As someone who is also autistic if I feel like everything is becoming overwhelming I try and leave before it hits this point. Do you have any feelings that start to bubble up beforehand? It can be different for me though I often internally meltdown and dissociate. The first time my partner saw me have a meltdown it was a lot for them, more so when neither of us understood why. Having the diagnosis at least helps people understand sometimes. \n\nI would just try and talk openly with them if you want to about your fears and why you didn\u2019t but you don\u2019t have to. Really depends on where you want to go from here. It\u2019s all up to you!", "NTA. Tbh I don\u2019t think this is even a YTA or NTA situation. This is private medical information, you have no obligation to share it (unless you have like an STD or something like that). So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH at all for choosing not to share it and  I don\u2019t think anyone else here saying YTA or gentle YTA is in the position to say you should have. Like do people expect you to announce this to everyone you form a connection with? Also this was an unforeseen trigger you didn\u2019t know this was gonna happen then. I would say tho don\u2019t be mad at your sister. There had to be some explanation for what happened. I\u2019d say just embrace the fact that your close friends know now.", "NTA You don't ever have to disclose it. That said, it may help to prevent meltdowns if you can just tell them you need a quiet space, or you need to leave, to avoid stimulation. Or if you melt down and they know that crowding you is exactly the wrong thing to do. I hope you can trust your friends. However if they think they are entitled to your diagnosis, they aren't very good friends. No one is entitled to that.", "NAH. Also autistic here. It is absolutely *your* prerogative how much of your medical information you want to share with anyone. (Barring some sort of contagion of course - but that doesn't apply here)\n\nYes, your friends may care and deserve an explanation but that explanation can be as detailed as you want it to be - you are not required to share if you don't feel like it. Often, autistic meltdowns are interpreted as panic attacks by NT people. I don't know why, if this or something similar was the case, they would be crowding the door and not considering how you - the person they were trying to help - were reacting to that situation. It sounds like a bit of a nightmare to me. Sometimes people try to help and it makes things worse, it doesn't make them bad but it definitely doesn't mean they helped. That's OK and it happens, everyone should offer everyone some understanding here.", "NAH. I doubt your friends are mad at you. Upset that you didn\u2019t feel you could trust them? Maybe. But that is different from being mad at you are thinking you are an asshole. I\u2019m a little on the fence about your sister.  It sounds like she was trying to help, but disclosing private information without permission is not cool. \n\nEveryone here could have done better, but no assholes.", "Minor YTA, but overall INFO? Why do you have such a stigma around autism? I am a 24M on the spectrum, i understand the difficulties, i was diagnosed late and have spent a painstaking amount of time learning how to communicate with others my diagnosis and needs. \n\nIs your family not supportive? Please dont be upset with your friends, apologize to them and let them know about your personal struggles, no one blames you here or thinks you're a bad person. You have friends worried about you, take your time, and try not to push others away, i believe in you!", "YTA, if you have breakdowns like this then you need to be in therapy and working on coping skills. Just having a diagnosis does nothing if you are not actively addressing the issues.", "You have the right to choose when and to whom you reveal your diagnoses.\n\nYour friends were concerned about your welfare and didn't understand why you did what you did.\n\nNAH except your sister.", "As someone with an alphabet soup of diagnoses (MDD/GAD/ADHD/RSD), ESH to you and your sister. After a year, I'm sure there was someone in the group you could have confided something in, even if it was \"sometimes I get overwhelmed and need to step away to a quiet place\". Basically, you didn't need to disclose your diagnosis, just some needs stemming from said diagnosis. ALSO, your sister should have just said that you were fine now but just going through a tough time or something like that, and left it to you to explain. I feel bad for those friends, they seem really great.", "NAH it sounds like they are just worried about you and they wanted to know your diagnosis to have been able to help you. It sounded like your sister told them so they understood.", "You lost your shit. Scream and shaking  in public. Lock yourself in a bathroom to cry for an hr. Then sneak out so they have no clue your gone. And when they do find out, they are terrified for you cause they don't understand. But your upset at your sister and the group. Wow...when someone loses their shit then disappear. People get worried. Understand that. How you reacted is so wrong and your 29. You should know better . YtA", "YTA. You have the choice to behave with manners and excuse yourself from situations that are overwhelming.", "NTA\nIf they really are your friends they'll understand your reasons but now that everything is out, you should try to have an honest conversation with them and answer their questions.  You probably gave them a big scare with everything that happened and of course they'll be surprised.\nI think your sister was in a very hard position and she was probably just trying to help your friends to understand what happened. \nDon't be so hard on yourself but also consider their feelings, they must have been really concerned and confused to see you like that.\nJust talk to them, it'll be fine.", "Gently YTA, if you don't feel you can be honest with them after a year, then maybe they aren't your friends. Ask to speak to them about what happened, tell them the truth, and apologize for not telling them sooner. You can be truthful about why you didn't say anything, but don't treat it like an excuse.\n\nHonestly, you are being a bit of an asshole to yourself as well. You do not have to constantly walk on eggshells and hide who you are just so people don't know you have autism. You should be able to be yourself, especially with your friends.", "From my experience, I don't exactly see a reason why you'd \"hide it\" from people. I understand not needing to tell people, it's not like an important part of your character. However in times like this it's useful to just say \"don't worry about that, it happens sometimes\", because theres nothing wrong with that.\n\n(obviously I don't know how frequently this happens, so use that to determine whether it'd be better to warn people in advance, or just fill them in if it does)\n\nI wouldn't exactly say YTA, but I think you may need to shift your viewpoint on it a little. Don't think of it as shameful in any way.", "YTA a bit here. These people are your friends. You had an unexplained (to them) freak out and then didn\u2019t respond to their calls or texts for a day(?) They we\u2019re worried about you enough to reach out to your sister to make sure you were okay. It\u2019s unclear whether your sister knew that your autism was a secret from your friends. If not, then she was just telling them what happened.", "I want to say this as kindly as I can:\nThere is a a strong possibility people who have spent time around you may have had an idea prior to having actual knowledge of your diagnosis. You may not be aware that you\u2019ve displayed some signs or clues. \nI try to look at it as being like a medical diagnosis; if you had diabetes and had high or low blood sugar you could be behaving differently than your normal and that would be acceptable, right?", "YTA", "Gentle YTA, if you\u2019re friends knew about your diagnosis, they would have taken care to have more sensory friendly gatherings", "[removed]", "Don't worry, you're NTA. \n\nA meltdown is pretty scary to those who don't know why you're having one, but you don't OWE anyone your diagnosis. :( I'm sorry this happened to you, at least now they know what was up and you don't have to feel ashamed next time you have a meltdown.", "NAH.  Of course its up to you to share or not share a diagnosis.  But on the other hand, why do you feel like it's something you have to hide?  It's nothing to be ashamed of.  There's nothing wrong with being autistic.  \n\nI would reach out to whichever friend you're closest to.  They're clearly concerned.  Don't be embarrassed and cut yourself off from positive relationships because of that.  All the best!", "It sounds like your friends care a lot about you and were worried for your safety. You are NTA for not disclosing your autism to your friends. I could not blame or be mad at someone for keeping that a secret knowing how ableist society is. The average person is pretty ignorant when it comes to autism (and mental health in general). It is also really common for women to mask their autism (which is why I am assuming you had a later diagnosis). You can talk to your friends when/if you are ready to explain why you didn't tell them. I would like to think they are a little upset because they thought you all were close enough for you to share that with them. I also hope they will be able to move on from this and maybe learn if there are any triggers so they know how to respond in the future. During a meltdown, I would think most people would need space. People touching you or feeling like you are cornered can make everything worse.", "NTA. You don't have to share your diagnosis but you don't have to hide it either. It's not shameful to be on the spectrum.\nPlus in my experience, it'll bring you closer to your friends. They'll understand you better and can accommodate your needs as well.\nOne of my best friends has severe anxiety is prone to having panic attacks and she taught me how to react when she spirals. Now that we live in different countries, she still rings me up because I can calm her down. \nI'm sure your sister didn't tell your friends out of spite. They were probably worried about you since they didn't know you were being overstimulated.\nHope that helps, OP. Take care of yourself.", "NTA. This sub hates autistic people, I suggest deleting this post for your own mental health. You are NOT an asshole in any regard. Could you have handled this better? Yes, but you now have room to grow.  I hate that you\u2019re being called an asshole for this, when you were a dysregulated person.", "Absolutely NTA. Your own personal diagnoses and health  problems are nobodies business but your own. They are yours to share(and yours only) if and when you feel ready. Your sister is an AH for sharing that information without consent, but you are not. I do understand your friends wanting openess and honesty but I believe medical conditions are a whole other ball game. They sound like a great group of friends who wanted to comfort you and make sure you were OK, just weren't aware of the situation. Maybe if you all could sit down and have a talk you could explain to them why you didn't want to tell them, or weren't ready yet. It seems like they would be open to listening and understanding and would probably get the openness and honesty they wanting. And you could let them know what you need from them should the mentioned situation arise again.. But of course, if you're not ready or uncomfortable, it's absolutely your right to not have that conversation as well.", "NTA.  I think it would be better for you to tell people if you can, but it doesn't make you an AH if you don't want to.", "NTA, you stated you were diagnosed a few years ago. That means this is relativity new to you. I am sure fitting in with friends felt great (I don't have any friends, so I don't know). I don't share everything with people I know, especially something as personal as this. \nThese friends really care about you. I would reach out to them and just be honest.

This way I might come across as quirky but others won't put such a huge prejudice onto me. In your case I might have said \"I am a bit sensitive to sensoric stimulation sometimes so actually I can react super heavily to xyz and I just want you to know that's normal for me.\" This way you can also excuse yourself and go to safety when you are overstimulated without having to say the label.\n\nI personally think that you are not obligated to share your diagnosis with anyone.", "NTA - it is your business. You share when your comfortable.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have to tell anyone anything that you don't feel comfortable with. However, I don't think sister or friends are AH either.

I got diagnosed a few years ago. I try my very best to hide it. \n\nI\u2019ve never had real friends. I\u2019ve always been a loner. But about a year ago, I got adopted by a small group of extroverts. We\u2019ve been growing close ever since. I\u2019m even slowly branching out and talking to a boy I like. Things are going well. \n\nLast week I had my first meltdown in front of them. It\u2019s all a blur, but I got so overwhelmed with the talking and lights and heat and everything else, so I just broke down. I remember crying really hard. There were hands on me trying to make me stop shaking, so I threw myself backwards into a wall. I think I screamed a lot. \n\nEveryone was in a panic, but I just wanted them to stop. I ran off and locked myself in my friend\u2019s bedroom. They all followed me and crowded the door. I just cried on the floor for what must have been an hour. \n\nWhen things felt okay again, I quickly grabbed my things and slipped out before they could notice. \n\nThe next day, I had 72 missed calls and over a hundred texts. I found out the next day that when I didn\u2019t reply, one of the girls I\u2019m closest to called my sister. My sister told them all my secrets, my diagnosis and why I acted that way. \n\nI feel really betrayed. Betrayed by my sister, and even worse, the group is a little mad at me for hiding it. They say I should have told them. Something about being honest and open and not keeping secrets. I feel like I failed them. I feel like a fraud and haven\u2019t talked to them in a few days now. I\u2019m so embarrassed. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I try to give this information to anyone I am close with, whether it is a professional relationship where it might be relevant or a friendship, family member, etc. For instance, I have a PTSD dissociative episode, that's an alarming thing for someone else to experience, and they can help me and be supportive if I need it.

Sorry you had to deal with that and now are not feeling good about it but I don\u2019t think you should feel like a jerk, just take it as a lesson in future social interactions. \n\nI think based on this it seems like your friends care about you. I think apologizing for not telling them, explaining you didn\u2019t want to alienate yourself/didn\u2019t know how to tell them, and for scaring them is in order on your part. I think they will probably understand. It will help if you tell them some of the things that overwhelm you and what best care you could receive if it happens again so they aren\u2019t scared you\u2019re really hurt.

Still, she was wrong to do so, and while your friends really could've done with an explanation, they wouldn't have been entitled to one.

Do not ever feel bad for masking!  \n\nHere is my advice for how to deal with everything: \n\n* **Hold your sister accountable for revealing your Autism diagnosis to your friends.**  This is a medical diagnosis and its YOUR right to tell them --- not her.  \n* **Tell your friends what is going on.**  Tell them what masking is and tell them that you feel obligated to mask because you are scared of what they would think of you if they found out about your Autism.  They SHOULD be willing to talk about what Autism is and the unique ways it affects you as an adult woman.  If they still think you're a jerk for not confiding in them, I would consider reevaluating their friendship.\n* **Check out Autism groups.**  r/autism  is a wonderful space to share autistic memes, talk about your experience as an autistic person, and read about other people's experiences too.  \n* **If you use TikTok, check out these creators:**  [Sound of the Forest](https://www.tiktok.com/@soundoftheforest) (a gal who loves bugs and the forest, autism experiences, and is the sweetest bean), [reberrabon\\_bon](https://www.tiktok.com/@reberrabon_bon) (actually autistic activist & actor who does an amazing job of educating folks about the autism experience)\n* **If you have Instagram, follow these folks:** [My Autistic Soul](https://www.instagram.com/myautisticsoul/) (super sweet nonbinary autistic person who talks about their autism experiences & love of Manatees, Bluey, nature and toys), [Autistic Callum](https://www.instagram.com/autistic_callum_/) (LGBTQ autistic person who does amazing info posts & autism memes using vintage photos, [Autistic Typing](https://www.instagram.com/autistictyping/) (powerful indigenous autistic woman, activist, & mother of autistic children) \n\nIf you need any more resources, advice, or just need someone to talk to, PLEASE send me a DM.

But I also don't think you need to hide your diagnosis or be ashamed of it.  \n\nYour friends are NTA for now they handled your meltdown.  To a person who isn't familiar with or not expecting a neurodivergent meltdown, they probably thought you were having a mental health crisis, panic attack, nervous breakdown, reaction to SA,  or drug overdose.  If my friend had snuck away after that like you did, I would have been terrified that they would self-harm or attempt suicide.  As friends who had the lack of information they had, they actually did exactly the right things.  They stayed by you, tried to help in the moment, checked up on you, and contacted a relative when they couldn't find you and feared the worst.\n\nIt wasn't your sister's place to share your dx or any other private information, but I am assuming she did so to help your friends calm down because she heard real distress in their voices.  I don't really think she's TA either.\n\nThe good news here is that your friend group seems like they are actually good friends and that the relationship might be worth salvaging.  I think they are probably still feeling shaken by the situation and once they calm down and have time to reflect, they won't be upset with you.  I hope that what they mean when they say you shouldn't have hidden your diagnosis is that they would have been less distressed if they understood what was happening to you and would have been able to help you better.  \n\nI can't tell from your post if you feel like an imposter in the group who got found out, or if you've felt like these friends were overbearing from the beginning.  If you have felt like their friendship wasn't true and kind, it's okay to walk away.  But if you just feel like an imposter because of your diagnosis, you shouldn't.  They met the person who you are and your dx is just a description that explains you beetter.  They probably adopted you into their group because they are kind and they like you.  If that's true, I think that if you explain why you didn't want to share your dx and how inexperienced you are at having friends, they will understand.  I think if you tell them about some of your triggers and how you prefer that they handle your meltdowns, they will be okay with it and actively try to help. They just didn't know how to help when it happened.  Maybe make it clear to them that you really do need space and quiet instead of hovering and touching, and maybe agree to text them when you feel better if you have to leave suddenly so they don't worry about you.  They unknown and unexplained can be very scary to people.  Autism isn't scary, it's something common they can easily read up on and research and be more sensitive about.\n\nThis seems like a situation where a lot of people hurt and scared each other, but all because they fundamentally meant well and lacked the tools and information to help each other.

It was gross and they were more than a little stunned that I went from helping sort paint chips to my service dog tugging away from my grasp because it was too tight and then the realization they had that I was not in the year 2023 anymore and they had to be very careful about bringing me back. \n\nI was ready to be dumped so hard and fast, to never hear from them again. To be alone again for being too much. Everything in the core of me felt disgusted that I had let that much of my condition show.\n\nWe're planning our eventual engagement and future together.\n\nIt's okay to let people know, they just want to know how to help if things get too much.

Going non verbal or having extreme difficulty with verbal or even written communication is v common during or after a meltdown. And I don't think it's in any way wrong that ops first priority in that state was to get essentially their most basic medical needs met. I'm not 100% sure if medical needs is quite the phrase I want, but my point is getting themselves to a place that was low stimulus and they felt safe enough to recover was rightly priority number one there\n\nI get it was probably really alarming for the friend group, and yeah if sister hadn't jumped in and said something, op probably would have needed to find a way to address what happened, with or without a dx label, after they'd recovered a bit.
