I have had 2 weeks off from work for the Christmas/Winter break. Now, I live with my bf (he is in his early 40s), one of his sons (age 16), and my own daughter (age 7).  He left his job at the beginning of December. When I work, I work a 40 hrs per week job, still come home and cook dinner, take my own daughter to her after school activities (gymnastics, cheerleading, and girl scouts) every week without fail. \n\nThe week leading up to Christmas,  we find out that his daughters (ages 8 and 12) would be with us the entire first week of break. No big deal. I live his kids and the girls are close enough to my daughters age and they all get along well.\n\nHowever, what I have noticed over the past 5 years that I have been with my bf, that every time his girls are around. I am the one who does the parenting. I am the one breaking up fights and arguments. I am the one to give consequences because he won't. I am the one to establish boundaries for bedtimes and tablet times, etc.  \n\nBy the end of that first week, I was exhausted! When we sent the girls back to their mom's house, my daughter's grandparents asked if they could take my daughter for a few days. I readily accepted because I figured I could use this time to relax, maybe catch up on some of my Netflix shows,  maybe get my hair done, just something to relax myself before going back to work.\n\nAs soon as my daughter left with her grandparents, my boyfriend turned to me and said, \"I hope you don't  plan to sit around the house all day the rest of the week. I can find plenty of things for you to do.\"\n\nI was floored. Here's where I may be the jerk. I looked him right in the eye and said, \"What, like you've been doing for a month now? I just wasn't a few hours per day to relax and just not have to worry about dinner, cleaning, work, the kids, whatever.\"  \n\nHis response to that was \"well then you shouldn't have become a mom or started dating me\"\n\nHe is currently not speaking to me unless he actually has to.  I know his son has noticed the tension in the air. My daughter is luckily still at her grandparents house, but she is super smart and will pick up on it if it continues.\n\nSo am I the jerk for my response to him or in how I'm feeling? Self care is super important to me.", "created_utc": 1673013017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104uobj/aita_for_wanting_to_relax_during_the_holiday_break/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

HE is the one who is responsible to take care of HIS children and he has no right to do that at your expense.\n\nHe\u2018s basically treating you like a maid/nanny. You deserve to relax during the holiday break.\n\nAnd IF someone shouldn\u2019t have become a parent, it\u2018s HIM!", "NTA \n\nHE can find plenty of things for YOU to do? Oh hell no. He can do those things himself and let you have a much-deserved break for parenting your children AND his children! \n\nI'd reconsider a future with a guy who not only lets you do ALL the parenting and housework but also then expects you to do MORE instead of resting. What is he contributing here?", "NTA You need a vacation. Take it. He can do everything since he s no longer working.  In fact just go stay at a nice spa hotel for the week and then when you have had your break consider if you wouldn't be better off without him.  So much less work for you to do.  He is the AH here.", "NTA.  Your bf thinks that women are servants; he will always treat you this way.", "NTA. Red flag - Your boyfriend admitted to being a person you shouldn\u2019t be with. Now that he\u2019s put that in your head, staying with him will only wear you down further until you\u2019re no longer ([e: for] lack of a better term) forceful with him.", "NTA there\u2019s an easy fix to this. Dump him and tell him you find somewhere else to live.", "NTA\n\nFor starters, his hands off approach to parenting is BS. He literally found out a week in advance that he\u2019d have his kids? He has no clue what the visitation schedule is? And then does nothing with or for his kids while they\u2019re there. \n\nNext, his comment was rude. And seemingly out of nowhere. Is there some background missing? I\u2019ve been off since late Nov and my partner is all \u201crelax. You deserve it! You work so hard.\u201d I\u2019ve done a lot around the house but it\u2019s from my own list not something my partner is insisting I do.\n\nI\u2019m not liking the vibe.

You sound like you can do way better..", "NTA but he is a biiiiiiig one. His first argument was throwing your choice of him and his kids in your face? Immature and a tell on either he knows he's guilty or he's a total moron. Judging from the fact he said \"I can find plenty of stuff for you to do\" aka for you to keep being a maid, I'm opting for the second.", "NTA. Run. That man does not respect you and never will. Seems like he has taken the place of a fifth child. It is inexcusable to expect a person to do so much without a break let alone be an AH when you so much as suggest he start carrying his weight.", "I can't help but laugh at how hilariously idiotic his comeback was. Firstly, who is he to judge you on parenthood? You have one to his three for Christ's sake. Lastly, how does he think self-reporting as a deadbeat dad and lazy bum is a good clap-back?\n\nThe silent treatment he's giving you is a manipulation tactic. I can't tell you to break up with this guy as I don't know what your overall relationship is like, but this whole situation would be a strike if not strike one for me. He's being grossly immature and communicated to you that he has zero intentions of helping pick up the slack around the house.\n\nNTA by a country mile.", "NTA, but he just told you that he is a jerk, won't change, and even according to him, you should not be dating him. I'd take his own advice and break up with him.", "NTA the person unironically saying \"You shouldn't have started dating me if you weren't prepared for a life of servitude\" is almost always TA", "NTA \n\nThe fact that he felt it was ok to say that to. That\u2019s really it.", "Nta but your BF is. Sounds like you need to decide if the rest of the relationship is worth you parenting everyone him included because this doesn't sound like a partnership.", "NTA but if you\u2019re doing everything, work, parenting, chores, etc., you really need to reconsider staying with him. He\u2019s basically an extra kid. I know you\u2019ve been with him a long time but sunk cost fallacy and whatnot.   \n  \nHe\u2019s showing you his true colors by saying that if you didn\u2019t want to have to do everything, you shouldn\u2019t have started dating him in the first place. I\u2019d imagine he has no intention of getting another job as long as you\u2019re providing financially as well.   \n  \nI say this in the nicest way possible\u2014dump his ass.", "WTF IS WRONG WITH HIM?? NTA. what a disgusting remark to make. Sounds like my old supervisor \ud83d\ude44", "I would say your response was a reasonable one to an unreasonable comment. NTA.", "NTA! Your BF just seriously sucks ass. Sounds like he's not even trying to put in 1/3 of the effort you are. Take the week to relax!", "NTA.

If he won't let you relax, think about some remodelling and take the human trash out.", "Nta\n\nBut why would you want to live in that tension.\n\nDrop them at your earliest opportunity for both you and your kids' well-being.", "Firstly, NTA. I don't even know why you would question it.\n\nSecondly, my husband, when he's been off of work, took care of ALL the chores with the exception of my personal laundry \\[as I requested him not to\\] and cooking \\[he sucks at it\\]. HE took the kids to school, after school activities, etc. along with all the chores... I came home to a clean house every single day. Our kids \\[one of which is not biologically his\\] were always clean, dressed and to school with their lunches. \n\nI've always made a lot more money than my husband, so he usually ends up doing more than I do, but I definitely show my appreciation and express how much it's a help! Now, our kids are old enough to do most of the cleaning (14, 19, and 21), and occasionally they'll even cook... no complaints here. \n\nThe 21 year old isn't either of ours biologically speaking, but all three are treated the same way. The 19 year old is my bio child from my previous marriage. The 14 year old is biologically both of ours. \n\nEveryone in our house has specific chores to do. Everyone is to keep their rooms relatively clean. Everyone is responsible for their own laundry. Everyone works except the 14 year old, but he is in school and to me, that's like having a job and he's too young anyway... I wouldn't expect him to work. He wants to... because he loves money, but he will do odd chores for the neighbors and earns money that way when he's not in school. But the chores are divvied up so that each of us has two tasks to do beyond laundry and maintaining our rooms. \n\nSorry... got off on a rant there. The point is... you're not married. It's a lot easier to get the heck out!!! Especially since it's just you and your daughter and you do have a job. Find a place and get the eff out of there! That's just my opinion though.", "NTA. Absolutely NTA.\n\nWow. Just wow.\nHe can \"find plenty of things for you to do\"?! What are you? His maid?\nHe doesn't think you deserve a break, some time for yourself? \n\nThe only AH here is your bf and his audacity.", "Nta.  When someone tells you AND shows you the type of person they are,  believe them.", "NTA. You need to decide if you are going to continue to be this loser's doormat for the rest of your life. He's not going to change.", "NTA  \"You shouldn't have become a mom or started dating me.\"  huh?  Are those your punishments forever?  No rest for you mom... you have to be a slave to your kids or your husband for the rest of your life.  lol  \n\nThey created takeout, maids, and hammocks for a reason... enjoy!!", "NTA\n\nThe audacity of this boy. Ma'am, you deserve a break. He has two hands and two feet, he can do some damn housework. What exactly does he contribute to this relationship? Dick?", "NTA. He needs to man up and you need to stop enabling his behaviour. He's not taking his responsibilities as a parent or as a partner. He's not working, he's not doing a fair share of the housework and he then dares to suggest you cannot enjoy some time off? \n\nHe's right though, you should not have started dating him\u2014you deserve more than what he has to offer.", "NTA Make him your ex and your life will improve drastically.", "NTA. After you dump him you should tell his baby mama that you\u2019re the one watching her kids while they\u2019re with you. This way she won\u2019t have to send her kids to be neglected under his care. She might also have some tips about his behavior.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
