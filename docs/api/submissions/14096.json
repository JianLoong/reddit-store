While it was an amicable divorce, I think it was hard on both us.\n\nMy current boyfriend and I started dating around 6 months after I divorced, and have been going steady ever since.\n\nNow to my former MIL. She was a wonderful person. She always treated me kindly and we got along well. After my ex and I split, there wasn\u2019t any contact, but I don\u2019t fault her for focusing on her son rather than me, just something that happens when families split.\n\nUnfortunately, she passed away due to some ongoing health issues recently. While I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in quite some time, it really affected me, and I\u2019d be lying if I say I didn\u2019t cry. She was in my life for 11 years, and she is someone I will never forget.\n\nHer funeral was slated in my exes hometown, and myself and my family cleared it with exes family that we would be ok to attend. \n\nI was nervous about attending, and knew I was going to be a mess of emotions at the funeral, so I asked my boyfriend if he would attend to help support me, and he said he would.\n\nThe day of the funeral arrived and while I wasn\u2019t expecting anyone to be crazy nice, the response I got was a bit more\u2026mean? As soon as I arrived with my boyfriend, we got some glares from both my exes family, and some of my former friends that still keep in contact with my ex.\n\nWe were in the main room waiting to go into the service with my family, when a friend of my ex came over and bluntly told me that my boyfriend was not welcome, and he needed to leave. I was taken aback by this, but honestly, I didn\u2019t want to take away from the funeral and cause a scene. We left and the rest of my family stayed.\n\nI got a text later that night from another former friend telling me it was extremely rude to bring my bf to the funeral. I didn\u2019t respond, but I guess I thought that after almost 2 years of being separated, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal\u2026AITA?", "created_utc": 1680728191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cxl5r/aita_for_bringing_my_boyfriend_to_my_fmils_funeral/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I see how you didn't mean to be TA.  I can see how your intention was \"good\".\n\nHowever, and I want you to follow me on this one OP, listen to this story from your Ex's POV.\n\nyou and your wife just seperated after 11y of marriage.  it's a hard divorce neither is happy about, but then she just ghosts you and the family.  After not hearing from her in 2 years, your mother dies YOUR MOTHER dies, and she calls up out of the blue wanting to attend the funeral after NC for 2 straight years.\n\nNow your mom just died and I supposed you're a bit confused as your Ex has been gone for 2 years without contact.  But you figure sure, why not, after being convinced by the ex that your mom was important to her.\n\nThen the funeral comes, and she doesn't just come to the funeral, she comes with a boyfriend.  Now at this point in time, to a hurt, upset ex, it might look like she wanted to come to SHOW OFF THE BOYFRIEND.  What does the BF have to do with your dead mother.  why are you here?  are you here for your mom, or for you to show off the boyfriend?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs i said, I can see how you got from A to B without any bad thoughts in your head.  But i gotta say, from the other side you look petty and narcissistic, and frankly.  you are TA here.  his mother died.  not yours.  I think he was being incredibly considerate to let you come.  but man.  flash your new bf to your ex at his own mothers funeral?  this is a level of jerkery I didn't really expect.  and the more i think about it the more i'm astounded that you were surprised by this reaction.", "Info: during this clearing it with the ex family did you specifically mention your new bf coming?", "YTA\n\nThat's why you got so many glares.  It really shouldn't need to be spelled out that this was about your EX and his family.  His MOTHER.\n\nI don't see that you had kids, so there's not even a complete reason for you to go.  Ex-family is not family.  Your ex-MIL stopped talking to you and sided with her son.  You could have easily send flowers or cards to your ex-in laws.\n\nIf you wanted to go, you should have gone with those mutual friends (or even your own parent or sibling).  A new boyfriend is not appropriate. (If you had kids and this was their grandma, and you were remarried, that might be different... but none of that is the case).", "YTA. Why\u2019d you bring your boyfriend, who didn\u2019t know the deceased but would be a slap in the face of anyone who resented you from your breakup?  That\u2019s a very selfish and strange thing to do. You\u2019re not an AH for bringing him on the trip, but \u201cleave that guy who doesn\u2019t know anyone in the hotel\u201d would be the polite thing to do. Same with bringing your Uber driver.  He didn\u2019t belong there, and if you needed his support to deal with the death of someone you haven\u2019t interacted with in years, and that need takes priority over that person\u2019s family, then you\u2019re an AH.", "YTA\n\nWhy would you bring a new boyfriend to you ex MILs funeral?\n\nYou go, you stay at the back, you give your condolences, you leave", "YTA.

Your BF didn't need to be there, and should have stayed home.", "Yeah, sorry, but YTA. I had a long-ago ex ... we really loved each other, but stuff happened ... show up at my mom's funeral like 10 years after we'd split and seen/spoken to each other. It was a sweet gesture on his part, but inside, I was like ... Dude, WTF? Your ex was a mess of emotions. Seeing you was probably difficult enough. Seeing you with your new BF? I'm sorry ... I'm sure you're a nice person, but this was a bad call on your part.", "YTA. Your family was going to be there with you, you weren't going to be alone without. You specifically didn't mention the bf when asked who you would be bringing. You're definitely glossing over details of your breakup from your comments.", "YTA if you didn\u2019t clear your BFs attendance, specifically.\n\nYou might be given some latitude given the length of the relationship with your ex-husband; however, that same latitude would not extend to your new BF, especially if the family and your former MIL weren\u2019t happy about the divorce to begin with.", "You and your your family cleared it with your ex's family to attend. As in, you got agreement from your ex's family for you and your family to attend? So you (or maybe your family) understood that you shouldn't just turn up unexpectedly? So that begs two questions: 1) why did you think it wouldn't be a big deal to bring your new boyfriend, who'd not known the deceased, along with you, and 2) if your family were attending with you, why did you need to take your boyfriend too for your emotional support?\n\nYTA.", "YTA\u2026Wow!! You didn\u2019t think after two years it would matter. The relationship you had with the woman was because of her son, your ex husband and long time partner. The focus should be on the MIL only and your new bf didn\u2019t even know her. You don\u2019t think the countless family members haven\u2019t thought of you as part of a combo of your ex and it would be distracting at best to be seen with a different partner? To bring a new man to celebrate her life in front of her son was extremely inconsiderate & selfish.", "YTA for bringing him. While I can understand why you wanted him there for comfort, you had your family there to do that for you. You bringing him was probably perceived as throwing it your ex and his families face. That may not have been your intention, but that's what they got from him being there.", "YTA must be so hard grieving a parent. You made an awful day worse. Shame on you.", "YTA who the hell brings a plus one to a funeral?! Please seek help because there must be something seriously wrong with you to think your actions were appropriate\u2026.", "YTA- I\u2019m guessing since you didn\u2019t see what you did was wrong that your marriage was not amicable. You took your new boyfriend to your ex mother funeral? That\u2019s extremely selfish, heartless and stupid. Since all your friends sided with him I\u2019m guessing your just an all around bad person.", "Bringing someone who wasn't invited to any sort of event is rude. Let alone a funeral. Let alone a BOYFRIEND to an ex's MOTHERS funeral.", "YTA honestly the lack of self awareness and foolishness is astounding. Are you usually this tone deaf?", "YTA", "I explained this in another post: people in some cultures see the funeral as \"for family and friends of the deceased only\" and you basically bring a stranger. If I were in their position, I'd be probably too much of an emotional wreck to tell you anything but I'd be bit pissed. So yes, I'm sorry, YTA for them.\n\nI also need to clarify one thing: I understand that funerals can be sometimes really hard on the emotions and people need someone close to support them. That's why I understand you wanted your BF to come too. But in my honest opinion, you really shouldn't bring him to the ceremony. You should've leave him outside, so you know he's close by. It's a compromise.", "I couldn't imagine being this socially inept at 32.\n\nYour bf should have declined your invite. You're both stupid people unfortunately.", "DUDE, Yea YTA. I get you to want to pay your respects but it really feels like you're showing off you moving on. Your ex just lost his mom and his emotions are raw he does not need to see your new bf.", "YTA On what planet would you think it\u2019s ok to bring your boyfriend? That is low class.", "Slight YTA. You said you needed your BF there for emotional support, but at the end of the day, the funeral was primarily an emotional outlet for your ex and his family, not you. You should have prioritized their emotions over yours and recognized that some may have found it hurtful for you to bring ex's replacement. If you couldn't go to the funeral without your BF, you shouldn't have gone at all.", " INFO: Did your ex not want the divorce?", "Wow. You are clueless and insensitive. You and your family were welcome. Bringing your boyfriend to your ex's mom's funeral is so far into asshole territory it verges on idiotic. YTA", "YTA.  Your *family* was there if you needed support.", "YTA. I'm sorry but it's pretty shitty to bring your bf under these particular circumstances. You said you were bringing family, you should have been specific as to what that actually meant. \n\nIf you really didn't feel as though you could attend without his support then you shouldn't have gone. It was a little selfish to prioritize your needs over the grieving family.", "YTA\u2014 I appreciate you asked but it would be awfully hard for me to be at my mom\u2019s funeral with my ex there, especially with their new partner. Maybe it\u2019s not mature or nice of your ex to express the discomfort seeing him but it was his mom\u2019s funeral. \n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s better to disappear or to have contacted her privately when she was sick to say how much she meant to you and how much you appreciated her. \n\nI wonder about the motivation to bring your boyfriend, and the way you only talk about yourself in this, that\u2019s why I think you\u2019re TA here. You cared about her, and that\u2019s nice, but you don\u2019t show you thought about how he\u2019d feel seeing you on this very painful day. If he doesn\u2019t have a new girlfriend, you look like a show off and rubbing it in. If he does, then you know it likely makes her uncomfortable for you to be there. \n\nYou should have prioritized his feelings and accepted his loss is greater than yours. The fact she didn\u2019t reach out after the divorce tells you she thought having you around would be hard on her son.", "You knew what you were doing.\n\nYou are the AH.  A HUGE AH.", "I was leaning toward everyone sucks, because really it should have been your ex's family to tell your boyfriend to leave, but his friends were just dealing with it so he/his family didn't have to. \n\nYou shouldn't have brought your boyfriend along. Yes, you might have been an emotional wreck at the venue, but you had your family there with you, who I am sure would have comforted you if needed. This was a funeral, an event for people who knew the person to come together to grieve and celebrate the person's life. \n\nHonestly, if you wanted to cry and let it all out, it would have been fine, it's a funeral.

I'm really sorry for your loss, and I'm sure you are crushed as this person was in your life for a significant portion. You are allowed to grieve, and it was absolutely fine for you to be in attendance. The part I have an issue with is bringing your current boyfriend. I'm trying to look at this through the perspective of the direct family. Your ex's mother passes away, so you show up with your new man to grieve. It feels more like a statement or a slap in the face to your ex and his family. I understand you needed support, and I understand that this is a difficult time for you, but you didn't ok bringing him along, and it can easily be taken as a statement rather than needing support to grieve.\n\nDo i think you were making a statement? Not intentionally. You were there to grieve for a loss of someone who was in your life for a while and with whom you had a good relationship. So i think it's a soft YTA.", "YTA it\u2019s extremely rude. You really need people to explain why it\u2019s rude to being a BOYFRIEND to your EX husbands mothers funeral? Are you kidding me? He wasn\u2019t involved in her life, he had no right to be there. Funerals are private, intimate events. He\u2019s not in that circle, he\u2019s not even your husband he\u2019s just some boyfriend. Super distasteful. You don\u2019t bring guests to a funeral Jesus Christ.", "YTA - I beg your pardon??? You brought your new boyfriend to your ex husbands mothers funeral?

And winders why you're getting glared at?? Read the room!", "YTA.  It was totally unneccessary to bring your boyfriend to your FMLS' funeral.  I am surprised he agreed to go with you, which doesn't say much about his sense of propriety either.  This was an egregious violation of etiquette and quite rude. Don't expect any members of that family to think of you fondly ... I am sure they are all thinking \"good riddance\" toward you.", "YTA...I can't imagine why you'd think it was appropriate to bring your current boyfriend. Unless you explicitly asked your ex husband if you could bring him and it was cleared. But it sounds like you didn't. Thank goodness your ex's friends intervened before you entered the actual service. Hopefully none of the immediate family saw you there. Do you not have other family for support? A friend? A sister/brother?", "Unfortunately, YTA. You are allowed to grieve your FMIL but you could have send a card or flowers and done it from home. They may have said it was okay to come, but it DEFINITELY wasn\u2019t okay to bring your bf. I am concerned that you have known that in advance since you appear to have not asked for anyone opinion on that beforehand. \nThe only thing I can say is that you MIGHT be a slightly smaller asshole than my sweetheart\u2019s ex who did the exact same thing. Partly because she did a lot of character assassination after they split, and really tried to get in close with her ex-in laws, so I\u2019m sure she was told she was welcome at the service. But she showed up with her new husband, pregnant, and then had the nerve to STAND UP during a part of the service when they asked for family to stand\u2026 MAYBE she was invited to be there. MAYBE it was \u201conly\u201d her ex that she offended by being there. But she made that sad family event about her and it was not a good look.", "I don't know if it matters if I'm a guy or not.

There was no reason for him to be there, he didn\u2019t know the family personally, let alone ur MIL. Ur ex is already grieving his mother, now u come in parading ur new bf. If u haven\u2019t spoken to ur ex mil since the divorce, why feel the need to go to the funeral!!??", "INFO- You mentioned in a comment that almost all your mutual friends cut contact with you, which makes me think this break up wasn\u2019t as amicable as you\u2019re saying it is. Was the break up mutual?", "YTA\n\nYour brought your new BF to your ex-MIL's funeral?\n\nWhat?\n\nYeah, no shit this was going to go poorly.", "YTA. You may feel this was an amicable split between you and the ex, but his side of the family sees it differently. Bringing your new boyfriend to their mother's funeral cemented it. I'm sure there wouldn't be as much animosity had you showed up alone, but you essentially shoved it in their faces by showing up with him. Hence, why YTA.", "YTA because you had family to go with you. You could have met your boyfriend directly after the funeral for support. It makes it seem like all of this is about you. If you cared for the person you were married with for 11 years and his mother, you could have attended without drawing this attention.", "she also started dating new bf only six months after the divorce. There is no rules or timeline for anyone moving on but I think i\u2019d be devastated knowing my ex moved on so quickly after over a decade with me.", "This right here! I'll save judgement because death sucks and does weird shit to peoples' heads.", "OP was close to her ex MIL for 11 years, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to be dismissive when she sounds like she really cared about her. \n\nI do agree that bringing the new bf was not appropriate.", "Other than family, I didn\u2019t have anyone to go with. Almost all our mutual friends cut contact with me and kept contact with him. Obviously it\u2019s their right, but my family was my only option.\n\nThank you for the judgement. It appears I\u2019m definitely in the wrong based on some of the responses.", "Agreed.\n\nThis wasn't about OP. This was OP's ex's mom. It doesn't sound like there were any kids involved and based on OP's comments, I imagine this was not a pleasant divorce. \n\nI just can't fathom how or why OP thought going with her BF would be a good idea? Having a +1 at a funeral is not a thing, and I'm sure OP's presence was simply being tolerated but not welcomed with open arms. In this scenario, you don't bring attention to yourself, perhaps sit in the back, pay your respects and quietly leave.", "This is the way OP, YTA", "They do these kinds of things for a perverse satisfaction. It is literally \u201cHaha, I\u2019m alive, and you\u2019re not.\u201d \n\nMy ex-wife and I went through a nasty divorce and custody battle which raged for years. Her father kept in touch with me, but the rest of her family sided with her gonzo mess 100%. \n\nWhen she died unexpectedly I was invited to the funeral by her family, but did not attend because I did not want to be a distraction for her hurting family and friends. I appreciated being invited, but courtesy dictated that I not show up and ruin the event for several people.  \n\nIf I was a prick I would have gone and made a scene out of it, which is what a lot of people enjoy doing. It is not about the loss of the deceased or the survivors - it is straight up AH behavior.", "yeah like who brings a plus one to a funeral ? Weird.", "I\u2019m guessing not since she says in the comments that all their mutual friends cut contact with her.", "It was not her right at all, it is not her family, they haven't even had any contact in two years. Her going period was unnecessary, bringing a date was just ridiculous", "I mean, it was only 2 years ago. 2 years isn't a particularly long time in the grand scheme of things. Especially when you factor in the divorce which clearly wasn't as amicable as OP thinks. He won their friends. That's pretty telling imho.", "They didn't mind that she came. They weren't  expecting her to bring a boyfriend", "They never said OP wasn\u2019t welcome they okay OP and her family going she never bothered to ask about her boyfriend of 6 months and just turned up with him", "Because I truly want to know if I did anything wrong, I\u2019ll be honest and admit when I was asked who would be attending, I just said myself and family. Maybe this was interpreted differently on their end", "Well she can grieve with her bf far away from her exes family", "It\u2019s not gatekeeping to not want to have to think about your divorce and meet your ex-wife\u2019s new boyfriend at your own mother\u2019s funeral", "Get over himself? She\u2019s the one that showed up to HIS mothers funeral. If anything she needs to move on", ">Because I truly want to know if I did anything wrong, I\u2019ll be honest and admit when I was asked who would be attending, I just said myself and family. Maybe this was interpreted differently on their end\n\nNevermind, YTA. Your boyfriend is not \"family\" in this situation.", "Unless the boyfriend was the guy she left her ex husband for...\n\nThat seems to be what has been left out of the story because something ain\u2019t adding up.", "It\u2019s not jealousy to not want your ex\u2019s new boyfriend at your own mother\u2019s funeral", "I get that people think 6 months is quick, trust me, we\u2019ve heard it since we started dating. But he is a great guy, and he\u2019s been my rock throughout the past two years.\n\nI\u2019ll accept I was the AH for bringing him, that I can understand. But everyone seems to have an opinion on how quick we were a thing, which is rude.", "You say your family was you\u2019re only option so they went with you but then you still brought your new boyfriend", "The issue was not that you brought your family, you cleared that. The issue was bringing your bf. If you had your family there, why did you need your bf?", "> Almost all our mutual friends cut contact with me and kept contact with him.\n\nThis is also a symbol that you were somehow \"the bad guy\" in the breakup, so it was likely not an \"amicable divorce\" (if such a thing exists - a bit of an oxymoron).", "Ok. So the breakup wasn't amicable. Your friends think you were in the wrong. Reading your post, I can see that happening", "huh? almost all your mutual friends cut contact with you after your divorce? that\u2019s\u2026interesting. i\u2019m sure there\u2019s more to that.", "Other than your family\u2026.you didn\u2019t need your boyfriend there. You had your family\u2026.who stayed btw. YTA.", "> Other than family\n\nHow many people do you need to be there to support you?", "A funeral is to say goodbye to a loved one. But mostly it is to be there and help those left behind.\n\nIf you were married for ELEVEN years, you should've been there to say goodbye, but mainly to be there for the people that were your family for so long. Your ex included, specially if it was amicable.\n\nTaking your boyfriend is making it about you, that's why YTA.\nIt would be ok for your bf to go with you and wait at the hotel so he can help pick up the pieces afterwards, definitely not ok to attend with you.\nYou owe them a heartfelt apology.", "But your family WAS with you. Given that this was your ex\u2019s mother, wasn\u2019t that enough for support? I mean, you had to have known there was potential for this to not be received well, so maybe you also should have thought beforehand whether this might create a scene and take away from the event.", "So don\u2019t go. This was a terrible move, and so brainless.", "You're a decent guy", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m not getting. Go alone. OP is 33, so perfectly capable of being a big girl and going alone. Or you\u2019d hope.", "She was a part of the family for 11 years when they got married, there was no bad blood that we've been informed of beyond the emotional strain of the divorce. Yes she had a right to be there. And she certainly had the right to bring her current partner of 2 years for support for losing someone she had been very close to. It's not flaunting to bring a long standing partner (and 2 years is long standing, many get married at that point) for emotional support while you're grieving.\nI've not seen many friends for over 2 years but the loss of them would still be devastating and I'd want to attend their funeral.", "Yes, and it\u2019s petty that they\u2019d be mad about it.", "Yes, she clarified that in the comment below the one you're responding to.", "We have been dating for over a year and a half. I started dating him 6 months after my divorce", "YTA for centering yourself. YOU didn\u2019t make effort to keep in touch with FMIL. YOU felt bad about her dying. YOU wanted to go to the funeral to make yourself feel better. YOU took your BF to make you feel better, at best for \u2018support\u2019 and at worst to show off.", "You said yourself and family - and didn't mention your new BF?!? Of *course* they thought you meant *your* family, as in the people who knew your ex's family. Why would your ex's family have any reason to think you would bring your new guy??\n\nYou didn't tell them the truth about who was coming, and are shocked they were bothered? A lie of omission is still a lie.", "It wasn't misinterpreted on their end.....\n\nYou and your family means you and your family. Not you, your family, and your BF.", "YTA you didn\u2019t even say your boyfriend was joining you??? It\u2019s almost like you did this on purpose", "How fucking stupid do you think we are? You\u2019re full of shit and you know it.", "You are your family is not you and your new boyfriend. \n\nYou never cleared it for him tk be there", "\u201cMyself and family\u201d definitely doesn\u2019t mean \u201cand my new boyfriend.\u201d Were you avoiding asking in case they said no? If everything was amicable, there should have been no reason to not be up front about this.", "Oh. That does change things, yeah. I would probably have cleared him with them before bringing him. If his presence was a surprise, then this is more ESH than NTA. They still reacted really poorly, but I'm not sure it was a good call to not clear his presence.\n\nFunerals are for the living. It may have felt disrespectful to your ex's family that you brought your new partner if they didn't know that was happening.", "Is.", "In the context of your ex\u2019s mom\u2019s funeral, it is irrelevant if your new boyfriend is a great guy. Your ex was trying to mourn his mother and is his ex wife showed up to the funeral with the guy she started dating 6 months after your marriage fell a part after 11 years. I\u2019m hearing a lot about YOU, your relationship, your grief, your feelings. This wasn\u2019t about you, it was about your ex and his family.", "It\u2019s not rude for everyone to think that. Honestly, it sounds like you\u2019re not sharing the full story. Your friends stopped contacting you and \u201cchose him.\u201d Plus everyone thinks it\u2019s quick means it probably is. At some point you need to look at yourself and be honest.", "The fact you are centering your own comfort at your ex's mom's funeral is astounding.", "No 6 months is quick. The divorce clearly wasn\u2019t that hard on you.", "It's almost like you came on a website and asked to be judged only to call the people judging you rude. Weird.", "It\u2019s not that quick. People on Reddit just tend to be extremely conservative. Don\u2019t let it bother you.", "Amicable splits happen, they just don't usually cause people to choose sides.....", "Definitely seems like something more is going on here.", "Well she\u2019s not apart of the family anymore \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0fso it\u2019s none of her business, understand ?", "Even if there was no bad blood, it\u2019s still not appropriate. She had family to attend with her. Not the right moment for her ex to meet her new bf. Also, she says in the comments that all their mutual friends cut ties with her after the divorce, so we are not getting the full story here.", "A year and a half is nothing, that absolutely doesn\u2019t give you the right to just show up to intimidate events with him like that. Horrible behavior", "Okay so I misread that but you still didn\u2019t ask permission for him to attend", "We had known each other prior to the divorce. It\u2019s not like I met a random dude and decided to shack up with him.", "Yeah, I've seen amicable break ups. Two people want different things, their lives are taking them in other directions, they realize they're more platonic than romantic...\n\nThis doesn't seem like one, though.", "Sounds to me like OP and her new bf waited 6 months to 'make it official' because she was having an affair.", "Not being married to him does not change the feelings from years of being there??? So yeah, the loss is a loss to her too. She even checked to make sure they were okay with her going to the funeral just to be safe. Like yeah she didn't ask about her boyfriend coming, but they've been together for 2 years. And from what info she gave us she in no way flaunted anything. She was there to pay her respects and grieve and they got mad that she had emotional support.", "We\u2019re getting closer\u2026", "Agreed.", "I did not have an affair.", "Well it\u2019s none of her business", "yup, there it is. It\u2019s making sense now\u2026.", "He\u2019s been her rock for two years apparently\u2026\n\nHello, emotional affair!", "Yup. Two years divorced, emotional support for 2 years, knew before the divorce, all her friends and ex family chose the ex\u2026 hmm curious indeed"]}
