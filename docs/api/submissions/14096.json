While it was an amicable divorce, I think it was hard on both us.\n\nMy current boyfriend and I started dating around 6 months after I divorced, and have been going steady ever since.\n\nNow to my former MIL. She was a wonderful person. She always treated me kindly and we got along well. After my ex and I split, there wasn\u2019t any contact, but I don\u2019t fault her for focusing on her son rather than me, just something that happens when families split.\n\nUnfortunately, she passed away due to some ongoing health issues recently. While I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in quite some time, it really affected me, and I\u2019d be lying if I say I didn\u2019t cry. She was in my life for 11 years, and she is someone I will never forget.\n\nHer funeral was slated in my exes hometown, and myself and my family cleared it with exes family that we would be ok to attend. \n\nI was nervous about attending, and knew I was going to be a mess of emotions at the funeral, so I asked my boyfriend if he would attend to help support me, and he said he would.\n\nThe day of the funeral arrived and while I wasn\u2019t expecting anyone to be crazy nice, the response I got was a bit more\u2026mean? As soon as I arrived with my boyfriend, we got some glares from both my exes family, and some of my former friends that still keep in contact with my ex.\n\nWe were in the main room waiting to go into the service with my family, when a friend of my ex came over and bluntly told me that my boyfriend was not welcome, and he needed to leave. I was taken aback by this, but honestly, I didn\u2019t want to take away from the funeral and cause a scene. We left and the rest of my family stayed.\n\nI got a text later that night from another former friend telling me it was extremely rude to bring my bf to the funeral. I didn\u2019t respond, but I guess I thought that after almost 2 years of being separated, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal\u2026AITA?", "created_utc": 1680728191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cxl5r/aita_for_bringing_my_boyfriend_to_my_fmils_funeral/", "score": 254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I see how you didn't mean to be TA.

After not hearing from her in 2 years, your mother dies YOUR MOTHER dies, and she calls up out of the blue wanting to attend the funeral after NC for 2 straight years.\n\nNow your mom just died and I supposed you're a bit confused as your Ex has been gone for 2 years without contact.  But you figure sure, why not, after being convinced by the ex that your mom was important to her.\n\nThen the funeral comes, and she doesn't just come to the funeral, she comes with a boyfriend.  Now at this point in time, to a hurt, upset ex, it might look like she wanted to come to SHOW OFF THE BOYFRIEND.  What does the BF have to do with your dead mother.  why are you here?  are you here for your mom, or for you to show off the boyfriend?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs i said, I can see how you got from A to B without any bad thoughts in your head.  But i gotta say, from the other side you look petty and narcissistic, and frankly.  you are TA here.  his mother died.  not yours.  I think he was being incredibly considerate to let you come.  but man.  flash your new bf to your ex at his own mothers funeral?  this is a level of jerkery I didn't really expect.  and the more i think about it the more i'm astounded that you were surprised by this reaction.", "Info: during this clearing it with the ex family did you specifically mention your new bf coming?", "YTA\n\nThat's why you got so many glares.  It really shouldn't need to be spelled out that this was about your EX and his family.  His MOTHER.\n\nI don't see that you had kids, so there's not even a complete reason for you to go.  Ex-family is not family.  Your ex-MIL stopped talking to you and sided with her son.  You could have easily send flowers or cards to your ex-in laws.\n\nIf you wanted to go, you should have gone with those mutual friends (or even your own parent or sibling).  A new boyfriend is not appropriate. (If you had kids and this was their grandma, and you were remarried, that might be different... but none of that is the case).", "YTA. Why\u2019d you bring your boyfriend, who didn\u2019t know the deceased but would be a slap in the face of anyone who resented you from your breakup?

You\u2019re not an AH for bringing him on the trip, but \u201cleave that guy who doesn\u2019t know anyone in the hotel\u201d would be the polite thing to do. Same with bringing your Uber driver.  He didn\u2019t belong there, and if you needed his support to deal with the death of someone you haven\u2019t interacted with in years, and that need takes priority over that person\u2019s family, then you\u2019re an AH.", "YTA\n\nWhy would you bring a new boyfriend to you ex MILs funeral?\n\nYou go, you stay at the back, you give your condolences, you leave", "YTA.

Your BF didn't need to be there, and should have stayed home.", "Yeah, sorry, but YTA. I had a long-ago ex ... we really loved each other, but stuff happened ... show up at my mom's funeral like 10 years after we'd split and seen/spoken to each other. It was a sweet gesture on his part, but inside, I was like ... Dude, WTF? Your ex was a mess of emotions. Seeing you was probably difficult enough. Seeing you with your new BF? I'm sorry ... I'm sure you're a nice person, but this was a bad call on your part.", "YTA. Your family was going to be there with you, you weren't going to be alone without. You specifically didn't mention the bf when asked who you would be bringing. You're definitely glossing over details of your breakup from your comments.", "YTA if you didn\u2019t clear your BFs attendance, specifically.\n\nYou might be given some latitude given the length of the relationship with your ex-husband; however, that same latitude would not extend to your new BF, especially if the family and your former MIL weren\u2019t happy about the divorce to begin with.", "You and your your family cleared it with your ex's family to attend. As in, you got agreement from your ex's family for you and your family to attend? So you (or maybe your family) understood that you shouldn't just turn up unexpectedly? So that begs two questions: 1) why did you think it wouldn't be a big deal to bring your new boyfriend, who'd not known the deceased, along with you, and 2) if your family were attending with you, why did you need to take your boyfriend too for your emotional support?\n\nYTA.", "YTA\u2026Wow!! You didn\u2019t think after two years it would matter. The relationship you had with the woman was because of her son, your ex husband and long time partner. The focus should be on the MIL only and your new bf didn\u2019t even know her. You don\u2019t think the countless family members haven\u2019t thought of you as part of a combo of your ex and it would be distracting at best to be seen with a different partner? To bring a new man to celebrate her life in front of her son was extremely inconsiderate & selfish.", "YTA for bringing him. While I can understand why you wanted him there for comfort, you had your family there to do that for you. You bringing him was probably perceived as throwing it your ex and his families face. That may not have been your intention, but that's what they got from him being there.", "YTA must be so hard grieving a parent. You made an awful day worse. Shame on you.", "YTA who the hell brings a plus one to a funeral?! Please seek help because there must be something seriously wrong with you to think your actions were appropriate\u2026.", "YTA- I\u2019m guessing since you didn\u2019t see what you did was wrong that your marriage was not amicable. You took your new boyfriend to your ex mother funeral? That\u2019s extremely selfish, heartless and stupid. Since all your friends sided with him I\u2019m guessing your just an all around bad person.", "Bringing someone who wasn't invited to any sort of event is rude. Let alone a funeral.

Are you usually this tone deaf?", "YTA", "I explained this in another post: people in some cultures see the funeral as \"for family and friends of the deceased only\" and you basically bring a stranger. If I were in their position, I'd be probably too much of an emotional wreck to tell you anything but I'd be bit pissed. So yes, I'm sorry, YTA for them.\n\nI also need to clarify one thing: I understand that funerals can be sometimes really hard on the emotions and people need someone close to support them. That's why I understand you wanted your BF to come too. But in my honest opinion, you really shouldn't bring him to the ceremony. You should've leave him outside, so you know he's close by. It's a compromise.", "I couldn't imagine being this socially inept at 32.\n\nYour bf should have declined your invite. You're both stupid people unfortunately.", "DUDE, Yea YTA. I get you to want to pay your respects but it really feels like you're showing off you moving on. Your ex just lost his mom and his emotions are raw he does not need to see your new bf.", "YTA On what planet would you think it\u2019s ok to bring your boyfriend? That is low class.", "Slight YTA. You said you needed your BF there for emotional support, but at the end of the day, the funeral was primarily an emotional outlet for your ex and his family, not you. You should have prioritized their emotions over yours and recognized that some may have found it hurtful for you to bring ex's replacement. If you couldn't go to the funeral without your BF, you shouldn't have gone at all.", " INFO: Did your ex not want the divorce?", "Wow. You are clueless and insensitive. You and your family were welcome. Bringing your boyfriend to your ex's mom's funeral is so far into asshole territory it verges on idiotic. YTA", "YTA.  Your *family* was there if you needed support.", "YTA. I'm sorry but it's pretty shitty to bring your bf under these particular circumstances. You said you were bringing family, you should have been specific as to what that actually meant. \n\nIf you really didn't feel as though you could attend without his support then you shouldn't have gone. It was a little selfish to prioritize your needs over the grieving family.", "YTA\u2014 I appreciate you asked but it would be awfully hard for me to be at my mom\u2019s funeral with my ex there, especially with their new partner. Maybe it\u2019s not mature or nice of your ex to express the discomfort seeing him but it was his mom\u2019s funeral. \n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s better to disappear or to have contacted her privately when she was sick to say how much she meant to you and how much you appreciated her. \n\nI wonder about the motivation to bring your boyfriend, and the way you only talk about yourself in this, that\u2019s why I think you\u2019re TA here. You cared about her, and that\u2019s nice, but you don\u2019t show you thought about how he\u2019d feel seeing you on this very painful day. If he doesn\u2019t have a new girlfriend, you look like a show off and rubbing it in. If he does, then you know it likely makes her uncomfortable for you to be there. \n\nYou should have prioritized his feelings and accepted his loss is greater than yours. The fact she didn\u2019t reach out after the divorce tells you she thought having you around would be hard on her son.", "You knew what you were doing.\n\nYou are the AH.  A HUGE AH.", "I was leaning toward everyone sucks, because really it should have been your ex's family to tell your boyfriend to leave, but his friends were just dealing with it so he/his family didn't have to. \n\nYou shouldn't have brought your boyfriend along. Yes, you might have been an emotional wreck at the venue, but you had your family there with you, who I am sure would have comforted you if needed. This was a funeral, an event for people who knew the person to come together to grieve and celebrate the person's life. \n\nHonestly, if you wanted to cry and let it all out, it would have been fine, it's a funeral.

I'm really sorry for your loss, and I'm sure you are crushed as this person was in your life for a significant portion. You are allowed to grieve, and it was absolutely fine for you to be in attendance. The part I have an issue with is bringing your current boyfriend. I'm trying to look at this through the perspective of the direct family. Your ex's mother passes away, so you show up with your new man to grieve. It feels more like a statement or a slap in the face to your ex and his family. I understand you needed support, and I understand that this is a difficult time for you, but you didn't ok bringing him along, and it can easily be taken as a statement rather than needing support to grieve.\n\nDo i think you were making a statement? Not intentionally. You were there to grieve for a loss of someone who was in your life for a while and with whom you had a good relationship. So i think it's a soft YTA.", "YTA it\u2019s extremely rude. You really need people to explain why it\u2019s rude to being a BOYFRIEND to your EX husbands mothers funeral? Are you kidding me? He wasn\u2019t involved in her life, he had no right to be there. Funerals are private, intimate events. He\u2019s not in that circle, he\u2019s not even your husband he\u2019s just some boyfriend.

And winders why you're getting glared at?? Read the room!", "YTA.  It was totally unneccessary to bring your boyfriend to your FMLS' funeral.  I am surprised he agreed to go with you, which doesn't say much about his sense of propriety either.  This was an egregious violation of etiquette and quite rude. Don't expect any members of that family to think of you fondly ... I am sure they are all thinking \"good riddance\" toward you.", "YTA...I can't imagine why you'd think it was appropriate to bring your current boyfriend. Unless you explicitly asked your ex husband if you could bring him and it was cleared. But it sounds like you didn't.

A sister/brother?", "Unfortunately, YTA. You are allowed to grieve your FMIL but you could have send a card or flowers and done it from home. They may have said it was okay to come, but it DEFINITELY wasn\u2019t okay to bring your bf. I am concerned that you have known that in advance since you appear to have not asked for anyone opinion on that beforehand. \nThe only thing I can say is that you MIGHT be a slightly smaller asshole than my sweetheart\u2019s ex who did the exact same thing. Partly because she did a lot of character assassination after they split, and really tried to get in close with her ex-in laws, so I\u2019m sure she was told she was welcome at the service. But she showed up with her new husband, pregnant, and then had the nerve to STAND UP during a part of the service when they asked for family to stand\u2026 MAYBE she was invited to be there.

But it wasn't like she was making out with the boyfriend in front of her ex, his family or friends.  Everyone should have just been respectful and kept themselves and paid tribute to the deceased.", "I need more INFO.\n\nIf you both weren\u2019t invited I can get it.\n\nBut at the same time I don\u2019t see how this is any different if one spouse knew the deceased and the other didn\u2019t. Like if she was married to the new guy how would that be any different? She was invited was she really expected to not bring her significant other, and where other people held to this standard?", "NTA. Of course you would want to attend with your current partner to support you. Why on earth not.\n\nMy mother and father divorced and always attended important family events with their new partners. The thought of leaving someone's partner home because a former in-law might take offense is utterly bizarre.", "My ex and his new wife came to my stepdad\u2019s funeral less than 2 years after the divorce.  It did not bother me at all\n\nI will be attending a memorial service for my father in law in a couple weeks, my ex is not even attending it. I will be attending alone, but if I felt the need for support, I would ask someone to attend with me.", "Okay I'm sorry but WHY would you bring your bf to your ex's mother's funeral? There literally could be anyone else. You really suck OP. YTA", "Hmm I understand your desire to attend her funeral.  \nMy former MIL's fianc\u00e9 died, they lived across the street from me.  \nDespite the fact that x-Mil has several children who all live close by, I was the one who helped with all the practical things and supported her in the days after his death.  \nI did attend the funeral alone, I was in charge of the reception afterwards.  \nWhen she moved out of their shared home, I was also the one who did the heavy lifting.  \nYou can easily be participating and helping as a former DIL,  \nbut I've never had a boyfriend with me when it came to meetings with my x-MIL.  \nMy children have met my boyfriend, but no one from my X-IL has or my eks.  \nThere will come a day when it can no longer be avoided, but both out of respect for other people's feelings and the desire to avoid drama, I postpone that day as long as I can.  \nI also understand your desire for emotional support at a funeral of a person you cared for very much, but you should have chosen a friend if one of your siblings or parents could not be that support for you.  \nI'm sure you didn't want to hurt others, but still, YTA", "YTA. You thought only about yourself and not about the family of the woman who passed away. Extremely selfish.", "Honestly it's kinda weird that *you* were even there, let alone this random guy. soft YTA on this one", "YTA \n\nYou should definitely have gone alone. While yes you might have needed his support, for your ex and his family it might have looked like you tried to show off how you have moved on from your ex.", "YTA\n\nYou thought to clear it with your ex's family for you to attend. You knew that was a necessary step considering this was your ex's mom. If you knew you needed clearance just for you to attend,  what made you think that bringing your boyfriend didn't need a mention? It didn't occur to you that you'd need clearance for that as well?  Seriously!", "YTA this is downright right - he has to deal with the loss of his mum and you think it is ok to take your boyfriend to his saddest day? This is so wrong and entitled.", "YTA you brought your boyfriend to your ex mils funeral? is this a joke? i refuse to believe people have so little tact or sympathy my god.", "YTA what the actual fuck, are you that far up your own arse that you only think of yourself? parading your new boyfriend at your ex\u2019s mothers funeral? how selfish are you", "Yeah YTA here. I can get you going, given you'd spoken to them and asked, that was considerate. But bringing a new flame is not on. Seeing your ex with a new partner is always going to be awkward and confusing but for that to be a surprise at your Mother's funeral...eesh.", "Holy hell. \n\nOf course YTA. And at his mother's funeral??  Yikes.", "YTA\n\nEverything I read in your post was abjectly lacking in any consideration for your ex or his family. You were married for 11 years and were dating this new guy seriously 6 months later. You keep trying to get people to look at it from your side. You have yet to look at it from the other side. \n\n\"While it was an amicable divorce...\"\nI'm a family law practitioner. If that were true, your story would've included a conversation between you and your ex to the effect of:\n\n**OP: Hey ex, I'm so sorry about your mom. New BF and I would like to come to the funeral to support you and your family. \nEx: Sure thing, OP. It means a lot.**\n\n\"...I think it was hard on both of us.\"\n\nNo, OP. You were in a serious relationship 6 months later. It sounds like your ex put on a brave face for you so you wouldn't realize the damage you did. Your hard and his hard were not the same. \n\nWant to know how I can prove this wasn't an \"amicable divorce\"? Because this woman you cared about so much and who was so kind to you for 11 years had nothing to do with you after the divorce. Nothing. That's not what happens in an amicable divorce. In those, the extended families stay friendly because everyone is happy with the outcome. You'd have had lunch with her from time to time. She'd have called to see how you were. You would have known her health was getting bad and been invited to be around as things got worse. \n\nNone of that happened. She cut you off. And you are deluding yourself, even now, about how this all went down. Your ex's mom might have just died, but you were dead to her two years ago. \n\nYou did not go to this funeral for the right reasons, OP. You went for you. Not for your ex and his family. Not to show love to those who lost a family member. You went for you.", "YTA for only one reason and one reason only..... you were married and now you are not going to get married to the \"boyfriend\" you have. You got downgraded. Wake up you got played.", "Totally cringe and rude to his family, not cool.", "Gosh! Some people here are heartless.\n\nNTA - OP was permitted to go. She needed emotional support. Nobody needed to speak to her. She was paying her respects. \n\nAttending was a lovely gesture and a testament to how she and her FMIL got on. Her FMIL would've appreciated it, were she alive, by the sounds of it.\n\nI think people should catch OP a break.", "It was rude to bring him. I feel you just wanted to rub one in on a guy who is grieving his mother. Move on ,leave this family be.", "YTA and have soup for brains; don\u2019t bother these people anymore with your air-headed assumptions", "HER attendance was cleared with the family. Not her boyfriend she shacked up with 6 months after the divorce. I don\u2019t want to be rude, but it does feel like you\u2019re projecting a bit with that anecdote\u2026 it\u2019s the ex\u2019s mom, not the ex. The FMIL she hadn\u2019t spoken to in 2 years. YTA OP", "There is no mourning period for divorce. Each person deals with it differently. Six months is more than long enough after a divorce to start seeing other people.", "Ok can\u2019t fathom how OP\u2019s BF would think it\u2019s a good idea to go with her! The balls on him! Something tells me he wanted to flaunt it too. \n\nOP I am sorry for the loss.", "I disagree with the majority of judgements. It is ok for you to move on after a break-up, and it is ok to include him in what you're going through. Everyone has a past. She meant a lot to you and it is extremely petty of them to resent you bringing your current boyfriend, who is your support.", "It wasn\u2019t interpreted \u201cdifferently\u201d on their end, it was interpreted correctly and in the way you stated. \n\nThere is absolutely no way anybody would say or hear \u201cfamily\u201d and think a boyfriend or girlfriend of a year and a half (with whom no kids are shared) would be included. ZERO.", "YTA. Don't play dumb. Nobody's believing your shitty lies", "Your boyfriend of a year and a half **absolutely** does not qualify as family in this context. I 100% believe they thought it would be you, parents, maybe siblings. Not your boyfriend you knew *before* your divorce, hooked up with and was \u201cyour rock\u201d *after* the divorce, and someone that you admit they might\u2019ve not even recognized! OF COURSE YTA!!", "It\u2019s not rude. It\u2019s context for why his presence made everyone so mad. You\u2019ve given your ex and his family the impression that you valued an 11 year long relationship so little that you immediately entered a serious relationship with no scars from or care for your previous one. It\u2019s people like you who make me terrified to enter the dating world again knowing that someone might dust me off just as casually.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s a great guy. Your ex and his family\u2019s feelings - especially at this funeral - weren\u2019t about you. Your ability to have a \u201crock\u201d wasn\u2019t the priority here.", "Nah not quick, esp if you'd checked out of your marriage long before divorce was final. You're either growing together or growing apart and usually for one of the partners, you've done your grieving of the end of the relationship if your concerns of the relationship constantly fell on deaf ears. But in the situation of taking your new man to your ex's mums funeral, especially after no contact for so long, it looks like from an outsiders perspective that you are rubbing it in, so yeah babe, YTA.", "Wait, so in your head OP is dead?? Do YOU know what that saying means? OP didn\u2019t say they attended the funeral for the FMIL\u2019s sake, they did it because they cared for FMIL.", "OP is loving and the checked with ex MIL\u2019s family if she and her family were ok to come. They are living too and came to pay respects. She should have rsvp\u2019d the bf that apparently was a sore point for the family.", "She was emotionally cheating before the divorce. She had a husband and now she has a bf that he is not even going to marry her because she is not to be trusted.", "There is prob a lot of missing info but as said by many others, judging by how some friends chose her ex over her does speak some volume.\n\n2nd, even if she was not to grieve alone, bringing a new bf, (which i presume no one likes or approve), to the funeral is dumb.\nWhy not bring a family member along? Or friend? Someone which will touch lesser pain points.", "No it is not quick well let's see, if she was emotionally cheating before the divorce then yes it is not quick.", "Grief support circles start with those closest to the deceased and move outward. Ex and his family have priority over OP. OP was fine to go, but should have left the bf at home. If she felt she couldn't attend without his support, she shouldn't have gone and honored her ex-MIL a different way.", "Do it at home", "I've been in similar situations. It's awful.\n\nWe don't know OP's full story, but as harsh as it sounds, it doesn't seem relevant here. \n\nOP, I understand that you cared about your FMIL and that grief is complicated even in the most straightforward situations. However. It sounds like you've been centering your own grief since your ex's mother passed away. Asking permission to attend the funeral was iffy - as someone else pointed out, they might have felt like they couldn't politely refuse. Showing up with your boyfriend was tactless. If you felt like you needed support in order to attend, you should have either brought a family member or chosen to send a card instead of going.", "Ssssoooo you were divorced before the actual divorce and your ex knows that and you had the audacity to bring the person that got between you to your exs mother funeral. Yyyyeeaaaahhhh you are the ahole for many many things here.", "Sure, Jan \ud83d\ude12", "Exactly. And she says that the divorce was mutual my ass. No she had found his replacement way sooner.", "For real. OP made this about her, and obviously hurt others in the process"]}
