{"id": 16465, "submission_id": "138uvdz", "title": "AITA for confronting my MIL about her behavior towards me?", "selftext": "I (32F) have been married to my husband (34M) for five years, and we have a one-year-old son. My MIL (62F) lives in another state, but she visits us a few times a year and stays with us for a week or so. We have generally had a good relationship, although I have noticed that she can be critical and controlling at times.\n\nRecently, my MIL came to visit us for the first time since our son was born. I was excited to see her and hoped that she would bond with our baby. However, things did not go as I had hoped. From the moment she arrived, my MIL started making comments about how I was doing everything wrong with the baby. She criticized my feeding, burping, diapering, and even the way I held him. She also insisted on taking over whenever the baby cried, even when I was trying to console him myself. She would snatch him out of my arms and say things like, \"Let me show you how it's done,\" or \"You're not doing it right.\"\n\nI tried to ignore her behavior at first, but it started to wear on me. I felt like she was undermining my confidence as a new mom and making me doubt myself. I also felt like she was disrespecting me as the baby's mother and not trusting my abilities. I talked to my husband about it, and he agreed that his mother was being overbearing and that we needed to set some boundaries.\n\nSo, one evening, when my MIL was criticizing me for giving the baby a pacifier, I decided to confront her. I calmly told her that while I appreciated her help, I felt like she was being too critical and not respecting my role as the baby's mother. I also said that I would appreciate it if she could give me some space to figure things out on my own and only offer advice if I asked for it. My MIL did not take it well. She accused me of being too sensitive and not listening to her expertise as a mother of two. She also said that I was being unfair to her and trying to push her away.\n\nThings escalated from there, and we ended up having a heated argument. My husband tried to mediate, but it was clear that both of us were too emotional to have a productive conversation. My MIL ended up leaving early and said that she was hurt by my behavior.\n\nSince then, things have been strained between us. My MIL has been calling my husband and complaining about me, saying that I am a disrespectful daughter-in-law who doesn't appreciate her. My husband has been trying to be neutral, but I can tell that he is torn between his loyalty to his mother and his support for me.\n\nI feel like I did the right thing by standing up for myself, but I also regret the way things turned out. I don't want to have a bad relationship with my MIL, but I also don't want to feel disrespected and undermined in my own home. I am wondering if I could have handled the situation differently or if I should try to apologize and make things right.\n\nSo, AITA for confronting my MIL about her behavior towards me? Or did I overreact and cause unnecessary drama?", "created_utc": 1683306297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138uvdz/aita_for_confronting_my_mil_about_her_behavior/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She criticized my feeding, burping, diapering, and even the way I held him.\n\nYour mother in law was not helpful during her visit she was an inconsiderate, critical interloper. It's not her baby and she needs to back off. You attempted to be diplomatic about your her interference. She lost her mind. If she left in a huff because you told her if you needed her help or advice, you'd ask for it, oh well, that's her problem.\n\nAnd your husband should not be conflicted or neutral in this matter, he should be 100% in your corner! His mother was out of line.\n\nI read posts like this and I thank my lucky stars my in-laws were and are supportive and considerate. When I was a first time mother, my mother and mother in law agreed on a rota to drop of meals, help with laundry and give me an hour to take a shower. They never overstayed and never criticized.", "Your bigger issue is your husband - trying to be neutral? when you're being attacked and criticized by his mom?! he should've stepped in as soon as her bullshit started. do NOT apologize to her. NTA", "NTA. Just because your MIL has had two kids does NOT make her an expert nor the way she rose her two kids be the right way. Many ways to go about things in life. Instead of grabbing the baby out of your arms (major no no ) she should had made \u201csuggestions\u201d that you could try. You and your DH need to set very strong boundaries now before her next trip. If she continues to call your hubby and do nothing but bad mouth you he needs to tell her \u201csorry to cut you short but gotta go\u201d.  If done enough times when she calls she may get the hint and not bring you up in any more conversations.", "Your husband should *not* be neutral in this situation. \n\nYou need to have a talk with him about how he needs to back you up regardless. You and the baby come first now, not equal to MIL. You are first. He needs to be COMPLETELY on your side before MIL will change, if at all. Unfortunately, your MIL will probably make the relationship between them go up in flames when this happens because she thinks she\u2019s done nothing wrong and now her son isn\u2019t siding with her. \n\nYou may even need to take away privileges of coming to your house to see the baby until she learns to respect your boundaries. \n\nNTA. Good luck.", "NTA. You spoke to your husband about it before you talked to MIL and it seems you BOTH felt that she was stepping outside her lane.

She could have taken that as constructive feedback, adjusted her behavior, and things would have been just fine.\n\nI hope your husband gets that he can't be Switzerland in this conflict, however. He needs to step up and let his mom know in no uncertain terms that he also thinks she's being overly critical of you.", "NTA. Your child. Your house. Your rules. If your MIL can't respect that, she can get out. Your husband should be standing up for you too tbh. Not being neutral. It's his kid and his home as well.

Your MIL and your husband are the assholes.  Your MIL for obvious reasons.  Your husband is also an asshole for trying to stay neutral.  In a situation like this, he needs to step up and pick a side, and the side he should pick is yours.  You are is wife, he is not married to his mother, he doesn't have a child with his mother.  And since his mother is the problem, he should be stepping up and handling it.", "NTA. Maybe you could explain it to yr MIL like you have explained it here, in a letter perhaps. Also maintain good communication with your husband on the issue, as you rightly point out he is caught in an awkward position between his wife and his mother.", "NTA. Your MIL seems to think she's entitled to call the shots and needed someone to correct her tilted perspective. You did the right thing to stand your ground and fend her off. You are a good mom!", "NTA- your MIL response to your concerns lacks emotional maturity & emotionally intelligence. \n\nYour husband should not be playing the middle like he\u2019s neutral. If he supports you then he needs to back you up & articulate to his Mom how her behaviour before was not acceptable and how her behaviour with her reaction since is quite frankly embarrassing. \n\nObviously you want everyone to get along but don\u2019t let that woman manipulate you.", "NTA - This wasn't a one off occasion where you pushed back on.  Unwanted advice and criticism is annoying AF - especially on topics like how to feed / burp / diaper etc.  Nice work standing your ground.  Unfortunately your dumbass husband has decided to go neutral and honestly - I'd be more mad at that then your MIL since he agreed with you at first but when the time came he was not on your side supporting you.", "NTA your husband needs to support you & enforce boundaries along with his mother.

Why isn't he agreeing with you in front of Mommy Dearest? Where's the united front as a married couple?\n\nThe only thing you might have done differently was make sure your husband was with you when you spoke up to your MIL, so that you could present as a team from the beginning. The fact that he wasn't there have him the opportunity to play \"neutral\" now that things have blown up, which makes him the AH.\n\nUltimately, NTA to you, OP. Your MIL was wrong from the start, and your husband was wrong the moment he didn't have your back and give you his unconditional support against MD.", "My daughter recently had a baby, my first grandchild. In our case, she lives with me. So, I guess I'm kind of in your MILs position. \n\nHowever, it has been 25 years since my youngest was a baby, and things have changed. So, I asked to go to the pre-birth classes with her so I could learn what the recommendations for babies are now. Because frankly, they change their minds ALL the time about what is best for baby, so my 25 year old info is outdated. \n\nI've also made sure to defer to my daughter with questions. She was ADAMENTLY anti-pacifier, but when baby could not be soothed, she was open to my suggestion of trying one. It works for him sporadically. I think she was open to my suggestion because I generally keep my mouth shut and take her initiative. \n\nAll of that to say, NTA. Yes, I'm grandma. Yes, I LOVE that baby more than I ever thought possible, but my daughter is the mom...not me. She has to figure this mom thing out, just like I had to. \n\nYour MIL is overbearing. I'm so sorry.", "NTA, Your husband being neutral actually makes this situation worse.", "I don't think you did anything wrong. Your MIL clearly was overstepping her boundaries. I also don't believe there's a one size fits all with how to parent, that's why it's always a learning process as it is in life. From what it seems from here, you apologizing to her may only give her more reasons to overstep more or continuing on this \"I know better/best\" attitude because she may twist that into a validation that she did no wrong. She also seems the need to control, which I'm sure comes from somewhere internally, but you shouldn't need to be the one to deal with it. \nConsidering you do want a good relationship after all, perhaps try to have a heart to heart conv with her? You could always apologize for tone only if it makes you feel better, but the msg and your boundaries need to be clear. If having that heart to heart doesn't work, then it is what it is with her, and may be healthier to keep a distance. Not only is she disrespecting you as a mother and human being, she is clearly also making it harder for her son/your husband, and too blinded of herself to see what she is doing. Does it make her feel better to put her son in that position? Would it make her happy to tear apart a marriage or relationship because of her selfishness? Is it worth it to cause all this drama in front of the baby (what's troublesome is that the baby would be intaking all this and could start developing trauma as the developing years come if this isn't nipped in the bud). I'm sure everyone can agree fostering a healthy environment is important.\n\nUsually those who are critical of others is critical of themselves. Your MIL clearly has some things to sort thru on her own, and I hope she could learn to soften. Maybe she simply wants to feel included, so maybe you could also ask her for pointers so she doesn't feel the need to snatch or prove something. Or you could ask her for \"help\" with some things, no matter how miniscule, so she could feel \"important\" or \"useful\". Sometimes dealing with people who are self unaware is like dealing with children. But please don't allow someone's personal issues ruin your peace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
