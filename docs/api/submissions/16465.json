My MIL (62F) lives in another state, but she visits us a few times a year and stays with us for a week or so. We have generally had a good relationship, although I have noticed that she can be critical and controlling at times.\n\nRecently, my MIL came to visit us for the first time since our son was born. I was excited to see her and hoped that she would bond with our baby. However, things did not go as I had hoped. From the moment she arrived, my MIL started making comments about how I was doing everything wrong with the baby. She criticized my feeding, burping, diapering, and even the way I held him. She also insisted on taking over whenever the baby cried, even when I was trying to console him myself. She would snatch him out of my arms and say things like, \"Let me show you how it's done,\" or \"You're not doing it right.\"\n\nI tried to ignore her behavior at first, but it started to wear on me. I felt like she was undermining my confidence as a new mom and making me doubt myself. I also felt like she was disrespecting me as the baby's mother and not trusting my abilities. I talked to my husband about it, and he agreed that his mother was being overbearing and that we needed to set some boundaries.\n\nSo, one evening, when my MIL was criticizing me for giving the baby a pacifier, I decided to confront her. I calmly told her that while I appreciated her help, I felt like she was being too critical and not respecting my role as the baby's mother. I also said that I would appreciate it if she could give me some space to figure things out on my own and only offer advice if I asked for it. My MIL did not take it well. She accused me of being too sensitive and not listening to her expertise as a mother of two. She also said that I was being unfair to her and trying to push her away.\n\nThings escalated from there, and we ended up having a heated argument. My husband tried to mediate, but it was clear that both of us were too emotional to have a productive conversation. My MIL ended up leaving early and said that she was hurt by my behavior.\n\nSince then, things have been strained between us. My MIL has been calling my husband and complaining about me, saying that I am a disrespectful daughter-in-law who doesn't appreciate her. My husband has been trying to be neutral, but I can tell that he is torn between his loyalty to his mother and his support for me.\n\nI feel like I did the right thing by standing up for myself, but I also regret the way things turned out. I don't want to have a bad relationship with my MIL, but I also don't want to feel disrespected and undermined in my own home. I am wondering if I could have handled the situation differently or if I should try to apologize and make things right.\n\nSo, AITA for confronting my MIL about her behavior towards me? Or did I overreact and cause unnecessary drama?", "created_utc": 1683306297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138uvdz/aita_for_confronting_my_mil_about_her_behavior/", "score": 755, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In our case, she lives with me. So, I guess I'm kind of in your MILs position. \n\nHowever, it has been 25 years since my youngest was a baby, and things have changed. So, I asked to go to the pre-birth classes with her so I could learn what the recommendations for babies are now. Because frankly, they change their minds ALL the time about what is best for baby, so my 25 year old info is outdated. \n\nI've also made sure to defer to my daughter with questions. She was ADAMENTLY anti-pacifier, but when baby could not be soothed, she was open to my suggestion of trying one. It works for him sporadically. I think she was open to my suggestion because I generally keep my mouth shut and take her initiative. \n\nAll of that to say, NTA. Yes, I'm grandma. Yes, I LOVE that baby more than I ever thought possible, but my daughter is the mom...not me. She has to figure this mom thing out, just like I had to. \n\nYour MIL is overbearing. I'm so sorry.", "NTA, Your husband being neutral actually makes this situation worse.", "I don't think you did anything wrong. Your MIL clearly was overstepping her boundaries. I also don't believe there's a one size fits all with how to parent, that's why it's always a learning process as it is in life. From what it seems from here, you apologizing to her may only give her more reasons to overstep more or continuing on this \"I know better/best\" attitude because she may twist that into a validation that she did no wrong. She also seems the need to control, which I'm sure comes from somewhere internally, but you shouldn't need to be the one to deal with it. \nConsidering you do want a good relationship after all, perhaps try to have a heart to heart conv with her? You could always apologize for tone only if it makes you feel better, but the msg and your boundaries need to be clear. If having that heart to heart doesn't work, then it is what it is with her, and may be healthier to keep a distance. Not only is she disrespecting you as a mother and human being, she is clearly also making it harder for her son/your husband, and too blinded of herself to see what she is doing. Does it make her feel better to put her son in that position? Would it make her happy to tear apart a marriage or relationship because of her selfishness? Is it worth it to cause all this drama in front of the baby (what's troublesome is that the baby would be intaking all this and could start developing trauma as the developing years come if this isn't nipped in the bud). I'm sure everyone can agree fostering a healthy environment is important.\n\nUsually those who are critical of others is critical of themselves. Your MIL clearly has some things to sort thru on her own, and I hope she could learn to soften. Maybe she simply wants to feel included, so maybe you could also ask her for pointers so she doesn't feel the need to snatch or prove something. Or you could ask her for \"help\" with some things, no matter how miniscule, so she could feel \"important\" or \"useful\". Sometimes dealing with people who are self unaware is like dealing with children. But please don't allow someone's personal issues ruin your peace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like you handled it fine. Children are not the same, and what works for one doesn't work for all (I used a pacifier, my sister never did, my niece never actually crawled, went straight to walking, a baby is a great napper, another hates to be put down) so advice is fine, but criticism is not. And parenting styles are also different. \n\nYour MIL can dish out criticism, but apparently cannot take it. Seems right. It shouldn't have escalated to a fight, but you approached it correctly and she should have listened to your concerns and backed off. \n\nNow, the real problem here is your husband. HE should have talked to his mother about her criticism, not left it to you to handle. He isn't in the middle of anything, this is HIS problem to deal with. And he shouldn't be letting his mother continue to say mean things about you, so he needs to get it fully together. \n\nSo now, give it to him straight: This is your problem to solve, and I am happy to help you. I don't want to hear anything more about MIL criticizing me, and honestly I feel hurt that you continue to let her speak poorly of me. You should of course talk to your mother, but I hope you would stop the conversation when she speaks poorly of me. You seem unwilling to do that, so at the very least I can put my foot down and tell you I don't want to hear about it. We have a new baby, and now everything is about MIL, and I'm done with that.

If she has a problem with that, it is her problem. I assure you that if you had not put your foot down, she would have considered that carte blanche to treat you however she felt like from then on.\n\nAs for your husband remaining neutral, there is no neutral when one side is the hostile, aggressive party and the other is not. Neutrality favors the aggressor. You are very clearly in the right, and his mother being his mother does not change that fact.", "NTA\n\nHaving clear boundaries set is critical to YOU raising your child, not your MIL. Be sure to show proper appreciation to your husband for supporting your independence as a family while still loving and respecting his mother. Sometimes, standing up for yourself is a very difficult thing to do. You did the right thing. I'm sorry it's soured your relationship with your MIL. If you all can, there needs to be a family meeting once cooler heads prevail so proper boundaries can be set. If your MIL doesn't respect those, maybe she shouldn't be coming around as much.", "NTA. This happened to my mom when I was a baby. A few days after my parents brought me home from the hospital, my dad\u2019s mom and her sister came over to visit while my dad was at work. He told me he found my mom crying on the front steps. When she told him my grandma took me and they both told her she was do everything wrong he went inside, took me back and told them not to come back until they apologized.\nWhile I don\u2019t have kids of my own, I think it\u2019s fair to let new parents learn what works for them even if it isn\u2019t what the grandparents think is best. If you have problems you can ask for advice or help. That is up to you as the parent.", "NTA do not apologize. You set your boundaries. If you apologize now all you\u2019ll really be telling her is you were right I was wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nMy therapist told me once because I have a MIL similar to yours. \nPeople who have never had boundaries enforced on them will fight you and do things to make you go back on your boundaries. \n\nYour husband sounds like he hasn\u2019t put many boundaries towards his mother. As the others have pointed he told you in private your right but then changed the script in front of her. Sounds like he has problems placing boundaries on his mother. \n\nStick to your boundaries. Eventually people will realize that your dead set on your boundaries and that when you place a boundary you mean it. \n\nTake it from someone who is currently dealing in enforcing their own boundaries and have currently gone low contact with my own MIL.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to get over herself and realize she's not mommy anymore. Her babies are done grown up. Time comes for us all.", "NTA sounds like MIL is being to sensitive of criticism", "Your baby your rules simple take it or leave it", "Nta. Go to r/justnomil", "Came here to say exactly this!", ">No child son or daughter should be made to choose between mother and spouse.\n\n\nIf you are talking about children, okay but a grown ass man with a family should put his family's health first. In this case, wife felt undermined, SON should have firmly told HIS mother that HIS WIFE got it handled. No ifs or buts", "I mean, it\u2019s not really a threat if it is a natural consequence of somebodies actions, is it? \n\nSo for sex, both parties need to consent. I think we can agree on that. Since consent needs to be enthusiastic, it\u2019s probably gonna happen when both are horny. Now, would you be horny if your partner just showed you you aren\u2019t their priority? That you can\u2019t trust them to have your back? Probably not. \n\nIt\u2019s not about withholding sex as a means of punishment. It\u2019s about treating your partner in a way that makes them want to have sex with you-which is exactly the opposite of what this dude did.", "OP has a right to protect herself from getting pregnant again in this situation. If that means no sex, that means no sex. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe him the opportunity to impregnate her again to trip her in this situation."]}
