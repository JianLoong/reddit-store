My MIL (62F) lives in another state, but she visits us a few times a year and stays with us for a week or so. We have generally had a good relationship, although I have noticed that she can be critical and controlling at times.\n\nRecently, my MIL came to visit us for the first time since our son was born. I was excited to see her and hoped that she would bond with our baby. However, things did not go as I had hoped. From the moment she arrived, my MIL started making comments about how I was doing everything wrong with the baby. She criticized my feeding, burping, diapering, and even the way I held him. She also insisted on taking over whenever the baby cried, even when I was trying to console him myself. She would snatch him out of my arms and say things like, \"Let me show you how it's done,\" or \"You're not doing it right.\"\n\nI tried to ignore her behavior at first, but it started to wear on me. I felt like she was undermining my confidence as a new mom and making me doubt myself. I also felt like she was disrespecting me as the baby's mother and not trusting my abilities. I talked to my husband about it, and he agreed that his mother was being overbearing and that we needed to set some boundaries.\n\nSo, one evening, when my MIL was criticizing me for giving the baby a pacifier, I decided to confront her. I calmly told her that while I appreciated her help, I felt like she was being too critical and not respecting my role as the baby's mother. I also said that I would appreciate it if she could give me some space to figure things out on my own and only offer advice if I asked for it. My MIL did not take it well. She accused me of being too sensitive and not listening to her expertise as a mother of two. She also said that I was being unfair to her and trying to push her away.\n\nThings escalated from there, and we ended up having a heated argument. My husband tried to mediate, but it was clear that both of us were too emotional to have a productive conversation. My MIL ended up leaving early and said that she was hurt by my behavior.\n\nSince then, things have been strained between us. My MIL has been calling my husband and complaining about me, saying that I am a disrespectful daughter-in-law who doesn't appreciate her. My husband has been trying to be neutral, but I can tell that he is torn between his loyalty to his mother and his support for me.\n\nI feel like I did the right thing by standing up for myself, but I also regret the way things turned out. I don't want to have a bad relationship with my MIL, but I also don't want to feel disrespected and undermined in my own home. I am wondering if I could have handled the situation differently or if I should try to apologize and make things right.\n\nSo, AITA for confronting my MIL about her behavior towards me? Or did I overreact and cause unnecessary drama?", "created_utc": 1683306297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138uvdz/aita_for_confronting_my_mil_about_her_behavior/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In our case, she lives with me. So, I guess I'm kind of in your MILs position. \n\nHowever, it has been 25 years since my youngest was a baby, and things have changed. So, I asked to go to the pre-birth classes with her so I could learn what the recommendations for babies are now. Because frankly, they change their minds ALL the time about what is best for baby, so my 25 year old info is outdated. \n\nI've also made sure to defer to my daughter with questions. She was ADAMENTLY anti-pacifier, but when baby could not be soothed, she was open to my suggestion of trying one. It works for him sporadically. I think she was open to my suggestion because I generally keep my mouth shut and take her initiative. \n\nAll of that to say, NTA. Yes, I'm grandma. Yes, I LOVE that baby more than I ever thought possible, but my daughter is the mom...not me. She has to figure this mom thing out, just like I had to. \n\nYour MIL is overbearing. I'm so sorry.", "NTA, Your husband being neutral actually makes this situation worse.", "I don't think you did anything wrong. Your MIL clearly was overstepping her boundaries. I also don't believe there's a one size fits all with how to parent, that's why it's always a learning process as it is in life. From what it seems from here, you apologizing to her may only give her more reasons to overstep more or continuing on this \"I know better/best\" attitude because she may twist that into a validation that she did no wrong. She also seems the need to control, which I'm sure comes from somewhere internally, but you shouldn't need to be the one to deal with it. \nConsidering you do want a good relationship after all, perhaps try to have a heart to heart conv with her? You could always apologize for tone only if it makes you feel better, but the msg and your boundaries need to be clear. If having that heart to heart doesn't work, then it is what it is with her, and may be healthier to keep a distance. Not only is she disrespecting you as a mother and human being, she is clearly also making it harder for her son/your husband, and too blinded of herself to see what she is doing. Does it make her feel better to put her son in that position? Would it make her happy to tear apart a marriage or relationship because of her selfishness? Is it worth it to cause all this drama in front of the baby (what's troublesome is that the baby would be intaking all this and could start developing trauma as the developing years come if this isn't nipped in the bud). I'm sure everyone can agree fostering a healthy environment is important.\n\nUsually those who are critical of others is critical of themselves. Your MIL clearly has some things to sort thru on her own, and I hope she could learn to soften. Maybe she simply wants to feel included, so maybe you could also ask her for pointers so she doesn't feel the need to snatch or prove something. Or you could ask her for \"help\" with some things, no matter how miniscule, so she could feel \"important\" or \"useful\". Sometimes dealing with people who are self unaware is like dealing with children. But please don't allow someone's personal issues ruin your peace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like you handled it fine. Children are not the same, and what works for one doesn't work for all (I used a pacifier, my sister never did, my niece never actually crawled, went straight to walking, a baby is a great napper, another hates to be put down) so advice is fine, but criticism is not. And parenting styles are also different. \n\nYour MIL can dish out criticism, but apparently cannot take it. Seems right. It shouldn't have escalated to a fight, but you approached it correctly and she should have listened to your concerns and backed off. \n\nNow, the real problem here is your husband. HE should have talked to his mother about her criticism, not left it to you to handle. He isn't in the middle of anything, this is HIS problem to deal with. And he shouldn't be letting his mother continue to say mean things about you, so he needs to get it fully together. \n\nSo now, give it to him straight: This is your problem to solve, and I am happy to help you. I don't want to hear anything more about MIL criticizing me, and honestly I feel hurt that you continue to let her speak poorly of me. You should of course talk to your mother, but I hope you would stop the conversation when she speaks poorly of me. You seem unwilling to do that, so at the very least I can put my foot down and tell you I don't want to hear about it. We have a new baby, and now everything is about MIL, and I'm done with that. I won't be speaking to her any time soon, nor will I be speaking about her. If you want to have a solutions oriented conversation about the issue, I am happy to do that, but the solutions need to come from you, and you need to be at the center of them.", "Nta.
