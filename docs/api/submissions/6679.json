{"id": 6679, "submission_id": "105b8o4", "title": "AITA for leaving my cousin's wedding and taking back my gift because my dress was \"inappropriate\"?", "selftext": "Hi all!  I (18F)  recently attended my cousin A's (25F) wedding in Australia. Lots went down, and I am getting flack for my dress. We are an Indian family, and A's husband M (26M) is white, so there were two ceremonies, like the Jonas-Chopra wedding. [This](https://www.panashindia.com/pink-floral-printed-georgette-lehenga-choli-2399lg01) is pretty similar I wore to the Indian ceremony, and to keep with the floral pink theme, I decided I would wear [this exact dress](https://www.lulus.com/products/remarkable-entrance-pink-floral-print-satin-midi-dress/1582436.html) to the Christian ceremony.\n\nA is my favorite cousin and the one I'm closest to, so I decided to go all out with my gift. My family got them something, and I added a little envelope with a cheque for a grand that I had saved from working.\n\nThe ghagra choli was fine for the Indian ceremony, so I figured the dress would, too, because they look similar in color and pattern. However, my dress was deemed inappropriate by M's family, and they approached me saying so. I thought it was because of the slit, but they all said it looked too pale and unacceptable, even though it was a blush pink with bright, almost neon colors on it.  I said sorry, but I didn't have another dress suitable enough for a wedding that I could change into, and M's family seemed mad. I left it at that and went on with my day. The ceremony was beautiful, and I was happy for A and M.\n\nHowever, when the wine started flowing at the reception, everything went out of control. I was on the dance floor partying it up with family and friends when I felt a splash down my front. I looked down, and I almost freaked out because I thought I got shot or something. There was this huge red wine stain dripping down my front, and I saw M's sister, mom, and aunt laughing, with M's sister holding a glass. I saw red, and that's when I snapped. I started yelling about how they ruined a brand-new dress for a stupid reason. They kept laughing, and I saw A giggle and M grin. That's when I decided I would leave and take back the cheque. That's when they stopped laughing. M started to ask me to stay, and when his fam realized how much money was in the envelope, they started to apologize and talk about how that money could be helpful in this economy. I left because I felt disrespected.\n\nNow M, his family, and my parent all say it is bad taste for different reasons. My fam wants me to keep the peace, but I don't want to give my hard-earned money to horrid people. Now I am getting texts, DM's, and Whatsapp, and my phone is just blowing up. I refuse to talk to A until she gets her husband to apologize, and she is trying. He just won't. AITA?\n\nEdit: my age! I am 18 not 19.\n\nAlso I am from the United States, not Australia for context! Also, at the Indian ceremony, A was wearing maroon red ( traditional Indian wedding colors) and to the Christian, a white dress.", "created_utc": 1673053026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105b8o4/aita_for_leaving_my_cousins_wedding_and_taking/", "score": 1069, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Regardless, an apology from either of them sounds like it would be meaningless.\n\nKeep the money and treat yourself.", "NTA. I would also have rescinded my gift since your \"gift\" can be technically covered by the family gift your family also gave.   \n\n\nWhat's disgusting is commenting on it. It's their wedding so unless you wore white (which that is NOT white or even remotely resembling a wedding dress at all), I don't get hwy they were so focused on you. I wonder if they felt upstaged or that M actually has a crush on you and felt you were taking too much attention away.   \n\n\nIf anything, your Indian outfit was way more showy than the dress!! So why have a problem with one and not the other? And they're blowing up because they want the $1000? F them.  \n\n\nI wouldn't bother asking for an apology. They're clearly unreasonable and feel taht you took away from their wedding. Imagine being so petty at your own effing wedding that you had to go harass a relative/guest! Losers.", "NTA. Aussie here. That dress us 100% fine. Sure, the base colour is quite light but it's clearly fully patterned. If that isn't an acceptable dress to wear to a wedding in Australia then 70% of the guests at Australian summer weddings are AHs", "NTA but why would you want to talk to your cousin again anyway? Remove yourself from their social media and just forget about them. Do you really want people like that in your life?", "NTA, both of those dresses are beautiful, and the ruined one was perfectly acceptable, in my opinion. Fairly certain there were some green eyed little monsters running round that wedding, and monsters don't get the hard earned money of the people they attack \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA play stupid games, win stupid prizes. They had no right to destroy the dress even if they didn\u2019t like it.

Now they're blaming you for their actions. Keep your distance for your own sanity.", "NTA imo\n\nThey were being rude, they were mocking your dress, even though this day isn't about you it doesn't mean you deserve to be treated that way. It's also your hard-earned money and you were only giving that much away because you cherish them. \n\nThe fact that they were laughing about it instead of trying to help you says a lot. It's teeth grithening and what makes it worse is that they became apologetic AFTER knowing how much money was in that envelope.", "NTA. I don't see anything wrong with your dress. What I find wrong is that they spilled red wine on a dress they didn't like (and not cheap either), but then laughed about it... but still wanted your money. They could've had their money if they hadn't done that.", "Nope NTA. I don\u2019t think either dress was inappropriate for either ceremony. Was it M\u2019s sister who initially approached you about your dress? Now if you wore a white dress or or anything looking like a wedding dress I\u2019d say it deserved, but that\u2019s not the case here. I would of taken my gift back as well. What M\u2019s sister did was definitely disrespectful for no reason.

Your dress is clearly appropriate with the color and design alone, not even counting the floral patterns. From what I understand from your account, the M\u2019s sister threw wine on you or at least it seems like she did. You don\u2019t deserve that level of humiliation, especially with the fact that they\u2019re way older than you as well. Honestly if I was you I would take the money back, especially if they aren\u2019t going to pay for your dress. Just tell them you were forced to take the gift back since you need to replace the dress they ruined. GL", "Screaaaamingggg. NTA. You go girl! Has your cousin apologized? She laughed when it happened too.", "NTA\n\nThat dress is perfectly appropriate.", "NTA. Both outfits were beautiful. Get the dress dry cleaned and ask the wine tossers to pay for it.

They are lucky you don\u2019t take more than just your gift.", "NTA It was fine to disrespect you until they knew how much money they were losing. Then they were all sorry. That dress is not inappropriately colored for a white wedding. Maybe if it was solid pale pink, but with that much floral, there's no way it could be mistaken for a bride's dress. Don't waste your time with these ppl", "That dress looks absolutely lovely.  The groom\u2019s family was way out of line\u2026.I\u2019d say $1000 worth.  Don\u2019t give them the money.

What they did was horrible and childish, and the way they changed their tune once they found out how much money they were losing is disgusting. It makes sense to take the money back, and they should be grateful you showed more maturity than them and didn't start throwing drinks back or something. \n\nM refusing to apologize just makes it even worse. \n\nI saw the comments about how you interpreted A's reaction as being more innocent, and agree about doing something special for/with her, as a way of still giving her a gift.", "NTA, you did the right thing in leavening and taking back the $. What they did is simply awful.", "NTA.  I can't believe the audacity on someone's part to think that it's okay to douse someone with a drink.  And furthermore, that others would not only approve but laugh at your humiliation.  I would be done with the entirely fucking lot.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with the colour of your dress. They were being rude and spiteful. Your gift was very generous. I probably would have taken it back too", "NTA keep the money because yes it would be very helpful in this economy. One: to replace the dress they ruined? Two: to get ahead for yourself and your future.  I am sure you looked beautiful and do not let petty jealous AH bring you down to there level. But if you want to go there be epic. Find a purse or something outrageous that you know she would want buy it, enjoy it and post it all over family chat.", "NTA - Please keep your money. Use some of it to buy a new dress. The apology was only triggered by your taking away your gift, so it\u2019s not sincere. This is supported by your cousin \u201ctrying\u201d to get her husband to apologize. If he was sorry, he would have done it without you asking. Also - I wouldn\u2019t talk to A until her husband AND his mom, aunt, and sister apologize.", "NTA. I think that M and his family were probably jealous of your figure or their males looking at you. Spilling of the wine on your dress because they did not like your dress is both rude and disrespectful. A not coming to your side and agreeing with the new in-laws was also bad.\n\nNow, let's get to that sorry and fake apology they offered you. I have always seen apologies that were only offered to either mitigate damages or retain gifts as a much worse insult than the previous insult. That said, you did the right thing. They did not respect you so they do not need your gift. M not apologizing only proves the point of it being a fake apology.\n\nYou keep forging your path and doing what you want to do. Forget these awful people. Tag you cousin with this thread so she can share with her new family.", "NTA...but your cousin is going to be in for a rude awakening. Her yt husband & their family feel it's okay to treat you like this because you're Brown. I'm sure A will be facing their ire too if she hasn't already", "NTA. \n\n\nYour dress was perfectly acceptable, not even *close* to white. I\u2019m so sorry you were treated that way!", "Someone was jealous of your dress. Keep the money.", "NTA: While I'm completely unfamiliar with Indian ceremonial attire the dress you wore to the Christian ceremony seemed reasonable. It wasn't white or a reserved bridesmaid color.  They weren't having a fit over the slit (which may have been a problem in some more conservative sets).  They just thought it was too ... pale? really?  How judgmental of them.  And dousing one with wine ... no.  (well, maybe the dratted MIL that shows up in a white wedding gown to her baby boy's doooooooom but ... no).    \n\n\nThat is not how you treat a guest at your party.  That is poor hospitality.  Take your hard earned money and go live your life.", "NTA. Don't keep the peace and don't give the check even if he apologizes. Keep the money and spend on yourself.", "Keep the check and send the sister a bill for the dress. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour dress was far from inappropriate. What *was* inappropriate was some complete AH spilling wine on you ON PURPOSE. If you had worn a plain white wedding dress, i would have told you you deserved it but thats obviously not the case here.\n\nANYONE who has an issue with you taking your gift back after that can lick a scrote. Im willing to bet if someone had purposely spilled something on them, they would be upset as well and probably rethink some things.\n\nTake that money and do something nice for yourself - a spa day or a mini vacation. Or maybe just buy a replacement dress, wear it out on the town and post lots of pics saying *ope here i go being inappropriate again...*", "NTA, in any means.  \n\n\nThey humiliated you and destroyed your dress. They deserve nothing and certainly not your goodwill. If anything they should be apologizing to you.", "NTA probably jealous.  Throwing red wine on you was disgusting behavior.", "NTA and cut your cousin off. She only cared when you took the money back but before that she giggled at your shock and ire. They don\u2019t deserve your hard earn money that you have been saving.

I\u2019m surprised no one else stood up for you, especially considering you\u2019re young and young kids usually do dress a bit more on the non-conservative side anyway. Completely NTA but everyone who was involved in this bullying fest sure AF is. I\u2019m Indian and this whole thing just pisses me off, you didn\u2019t deserve any of this! I\u2019m so sorry for you OP and if I saw that happen, I would have personally taken a bottle of wine and given them the same treatment back along with a punch or two in the face but you\u2019re far better at controlling your emotions than I am, lol. *virtual hug to you OP*", "NTA at all.\n\nM\u2019s family is terrible\n\nI avoid blush at weddings, but that dress is definitely pink and the florals make it obvious it\u2019s not trying to be white or a wedding dress.\n\nTheir behavior was tacky and their harassment of you for the money even tackier.", "NTA\n\nThe dress is lovely and fine by \u201cdon\u2019t wear white to a Christian wedding\u201d standards so they got nothing on you. M\u2019s family should pay back the cost of the dry cleaning or the dress if you couldn\u2019t get the stain out.\n\nI\u2019m a white Australian, a grand in USD is so much money here, holy shit! \u201cKeeping the peace\u201d isn\u2019t important when someone is being disrespected as you were. Besides they had 2 weddings for crying sake! They get a fight in one of them and that\u2019s how it goes, it\u2019s the way of the world and particularly this country", "NTA do not give them a cent", "NTA. I'm Australian and they all knew better but decided to pull some bogan shit anyway and it backfired. Stick to your guns.", ">  Now M, his family, and my parent all say it is bad taste for different reasons.   \n    \nNTA.  \"Yes.  Bullying is in extreme bad taste.  You all were horrible.  And there is no way.  I would ever give an extra gift after that.\"   \n    \nYou did good.  You stood up for yourself.  Against bullying.  And major disrespect.  Keep it up.  Keep standing up for yourself.", "NTA. So you\u2019re not good enough for them until they find out there was $1000 in the envelope? Ya take your money and run. How childish of his family to do that.", "NTA. Keep your money.  They ruined your dress, embarrassed you, and only apologized when you took the money back.  That\u2019s not a real apology.  Even with a sincere one, the fact they thought this up and followed through with it is unacceptable. Do not let anyone talk you into giving up the money you worked for.", "Australian here, absolutely NTA and good on you for taking the cheque. Absolutely shit behaviour.", "Also, reading the reviews on the website, the majority of them are gushing about how it's such a perfect... wedding guest dress.", "This is what I thought! It's a perfect dress for an Australian wedding. There's more behind this than some issue about the dress.", "Also, M's sister should be paying the cost of cleaning your dress. Conveniently, it will cost the gift amount to clean/repair/replace your dress. The gift amount can be retrieved from M's sister at their own discretion.", "Happy cake day!", "This is the way.", "> I would also have rescinded my gift since your \"gift\" can be technically covered by the family gift your family also gave.\n\nIf her parents were decent.  They would have taken their gift.  And also left.  OP was justified.  Even if it was the only gift.", "Oh look. Another asshole who doesn\u2019t mind their own business and comments on posts they thinks are fake.", "Did she step in to help clean AFTER you said you were taking the cheque?\n\nThats how you can tell the motive of her helping to clean and cover saying she thought it was orchestrated ? Also why would his family be in on this and not her/your side that is Indian who have these traditions. Also wouldnt she have noticed her / your family not laughing and just those women were?\n\nAlso bill the husbands family for a replacement dress or cost of dry cleaning if the stains come out.  And her new inlaws - can substitute the 1000 she lost, its on them to cover the gift the couple lost.", "So your cousin didn't have a problem with the dress herself? MIL and SIL decided to cause a drama over something THEY were offended by at a wedding that wasn't theirs? Got to say, if I were the bride I would be way more pissed at them, but I guess she might be having to tangle fitting in with the new in laws. \nAt my brother's wedding, our own cousin brought her kid despite it being a no kid wedding, and there was no place for him at the table, place really unsuited to kids. Some on my side of the family were a bit annoyed about it when we realised, but none of us said or did anything at the wedding, figuring if if my brother and SIL had an issue with it they would say so. It's not our job to cause drama here.", "Did anyone else -such as the ones who ruined the dress -offer to pay for its cleaning?\nNTA,  but the cousin's in-laws  certainly are. Weird, horrible people. Use the money on yourself.", "Her husband and his family are jerks. Don't gift them that money. Nta", "A took your side and tried to help you. So why did you storm off and take the cheque away from her?", "Are these ladies in bad shape and ugly? Women get jealous of young women.", "You don\u2019t just need an apology from M, you need an apology from his entire racist family. (And they can\u2019t give one just because they think you are going to give them money because that ship has sailed). I would tell A you are sorry they ruined the wedding and deprived her of the gift, but that was a choice M and his family made.", "Replace it out of the $1000 and keep the rest!", "They must replace the dress or pay for it to be cleaned that leaves no stain and doesnt damage the dress. File a small claims suit -  you fill out the paperwork yourself and lodge at at court if you are in the US", "In Asian culture it's all about \"face\". The family removing their gift would have been the biggest no no worse than OP taking back the $1000. The situation would be infinitely worse if the family took the gift back.", "I was literally just thinking of this video yesterday!!", "Under those circumstances (where she didn't know, and then when she realized what had happened, tried to help you at the risk of her own multi-thousand dollar dress), why are you still refusing to speak to her even individually? I feel like I'm missing something.", "Overall, I think you are NTA, but this piece comes closest to making you an AH. There should never have been a mention of what size the gift was. It's both crass and makes it impossible for you to separate out genuine reactions from just-lost-a-thousand-dollars reactions.", "> In Asian culture it's all about \"face\".\n\nIf it was about \"face\".  They wouldn't tolerate the disrespect.  They would have stood up.  Taken the gift back.  And said that doing that to family.  Is doing it to everyone.", "Yeah, it was. But there was Bollywood music playing at times, and everyone just looked like they were having a great time, so something as dramatic as this would def not be the first thing I would think of, especially in her shoes.", "Don't treat her. She laughed at you and was only sorry when you took your gift back. Soon as she gets money or an expensive spa treatment out of you she'll go right back to laughing with everyone else.\nEdit: and what kind of \"tradition\" publicly humiliates a teen in such a way that her clothing is ruined and unwearable? Especially IN A PUBLIC SETTING?! Op, you're young and want to believe the best in people I'm sure, but there's not a single non ahole person that would ever condone that kind of thing. Especially if she had no idea what was going on. Her first reaction should have been outrage, not laughter.", "NO!  She laughed about it.", "I highly doubt that a didnt know and I highly doubt that ahs truly believes it was orchestrated. Shes lying because she just wants the money. Dont treat her to anything, its all a ruse", "If your sure A wasn\u2019t in on it and thought it was orchestrated go on a trip or something with her and send a video to her husband\u2019s family. NTA", "Also Aussie \n\nPersonally I hate the slit in the dress. But the dress is fine for a wedding", "That\u2019s not the kind of face it\u2019s about.", "Yeah if she's never planning to wear the dress again, the $1000 would be worth it", "welcome 6th aussie! i appreciate your opinion", "U/hmmtaco said it best\u2026 M\u2019s family are horrible", "The dress was perfect (Aussie here). I'm so sorry this happened to you. Don't think we're all that horrible!", "I mean, the night prior there was a performance that required a cup of water being thrown as a recreation of their first date before breaking out in the Kabhi Kabhi Aditi song so it wasn't that far fetched", "Dress ruining shenanigans haven't happened at any Indian wedding I've attended."]}
