{"id": 6679, "submission_id": "105b8o4", "title": "AITA for leaving my cousin's wedding and taking back my gift because my dress was \"inappropriate\"?", "selftext": "Hi all!  I (18F)  recently attended my cousin A's (25F) wedding in Australia. Lots went down, and I am getting flack for my dress. We are an Indian family, and A's husband M (26M) is white, so there were two ceremonies, like the Jonas-Chopra wedding. [This](https://www.panashindia.com/pink-floral-printed-georgette-lehenga-choli-2399lg01) is pretty similar I wore to the Indian ceremony, and to keep with the floral pink theme, I decided I would wear [this exact dress](https://www.lulus.com/products/remarkable-entrance-pink-floral-print-satin-midi-dress/1582436.html) to the Christian ceremony.\n\nA is my favorite cousin and the one I'm closest to, so I decided to go all out with my gift. My family got them something, and I added a little envelope with a cheque for a grand that I had saved from working.\n\nThe ghagra choli was fine for the Indian ceremony, so I figured the dress would, too, because they look similar in color and pattern. However, my dress was deemed inappropriate by M's family, and they approached me saying so. I thought it was because of the slit, but they all said it looked too pale and unacceptable, even though it was a blush pink with bright, almost neon colors on it.  I said sorry, but I didn't have another dress suitable enough for a wedding that I could change into, and M's family seemed mad. I left it at that and went on with my day. The ceremony was beautiful, and I was happy for A and M.\n\nHowever, when the wine started flowing at the reception, everything went out of control. I was on the dance floor partying it up with family and friends when I felt a splash down my front. I looked down, and I almost freaked out because I thought I got shot or something. There was this huge red wine stain dripping down my front, and I saw M's sister, mom, and aunt laughing, with M's sister holding a glass. I saw red, and that's when I snapped. I started yelling about how they ruined a brand-new dress for a stupid reason. They kept laughing, and I saw A giggle and M grin. That's when I decided I would leave and take back the cheque. That's when they stopped laughing. M started to ask me to stay, and when his fam realized how much money was in the envelope, they started to apologize and talk about how that money could be helpful in this economy. I left because I felt disrespected.\n\nNow M, his family, and my parent all say it is bad taste for different reasons. My fam wants me to keep the peace, but I don't want to give my hard-earned money to horrid people. Now I am getting texts, DM's, and Whatsapp, and my phone is just blowing up. I refuse to talk to A until she gets her husband to apologize, and she is trying. He just won't. AITA?\n\nEdit: my age! I am 18 not 19.\n\nAlso I am from the United States, not Australia for context! Also, at the Indian ceremony, A was wearing maroon red ( traditional Indian wedding colors) and to the Christian, a white dress.", "created_utc": 1673053026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105b8o4/aita_for_leaving_my_cousins_wedding_and_taking/", "score": 574, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Regardless, an apology from either of them sounds like it would be meaningless.\n\nKeep the money and treat yourself.", "NTA. I would also have rescinded my gift since your \"gift\" can be technically covered by the family gift your family also gave.   \n\n\nWhat's disgusting is commenting on it. It's their wedding so unless you wore white (which that is NOT white or even remotely resembling a wedding dress at all), I don't get hwy they were so focused on you. I wonder if they felt upstaged or that M actually has a crush on you and felt you were taking too much attention away.   \n\n\nIf anything, your Indian outfit was way more showy than the dress!! So why have a problem with one and not the other? And they're blowing up because they want the $1000? F them.  \n\n\nI wouldn't bother asking for an apology. They're clearly unreasonable and feel taht you took away from their wedding. Imagine being so petty at your own effing wedding that you had to go harass a relative/guest! Losers.", "NTA. Aussie here. That dress us 100% fine. Sure, the base colour is quite light but it's clearly fully patterned. If that isn't an acceptable dress to wear to a wedding in Australia then 70% of the guests at Australian summer weddings are AHs", "NTA but why would you want to talk to your cousin again anyway? Remove yourself from their social media and just forget about them. Do you really want people like that in your life?", "NTA, both of those dresses are beautiful, and the ruined one was perfectly acceptable, in my opinion. Fairly certain there were some green eyed little monsters running round that wedding, and monsters don't get the hard earned money of the people they attack \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA play stupid games, win stupid prizes. They had no right to destroy the dress even if they didn\u2019t like it.

Now they're blaming you for their actions. Keep your distance for your own sanity.", "NTA imo\n\nThey were being rude, they were mocking your dress, even though this day isn't about you it doesn't mean you deserve to be treated that way. It's also your hard-earned money and you were only giving that much away because you cherish them. \n\nThe fact that they were laughing about it instead of trying to help you says a lot. It's teeth grithening and what makes it worse is that they became apologetic AFTER knowing how much money was in that envelope.", "NTA. I don't see anything wrong with your dress. What I find wrong is that they spilled red wine on a dress they didn't like (and not cheap either), but then laughed about it... but still wanted your money. They could've had their money if they hadn't done that.", "Nope NTA. I don\u2019t think either dress was inappropriate for either ceremony. Was it M\u2019s sister who initially approached you about your dress? Now if you wore a white dress or or anything looking like a wedding dress I\u2019d say it deserved, but that\u2019s not the case here. I would of taken my gift back as well. What M\u2019s sister did was definitely disrespectful for no reason.

Your dress is clearly appropriate with the color and design alone, not even counting the floral patterns. From what I understand from your account, the M\u2019s sister threw wine on you or at least it seems like she did. You don\u2019t deserve that level of humiliation, especially with the fact that they\u2019re way older than you as well. Honestly if I was you I would take the money back, especially if they aren\u2019t going to pay for your dress. Just tell them you were forced to take the gift back since you need to replace the dress they ruined. GL", "Screaaaamingggg. NTA. You go girl! Has your cousin apologized? She laughed when it happened too.", "NTA\n\nThat dress is perfectly appropriate.", "NTA. Both outfits were beautiful. Get the dress dry cleaned and ask the wine tossers to pay for it. Block them all after they say no.", "NTA usually I say you don't take back gifts but fuck them say that will help pay for a new dress", "NTA - don\u2019t give your money to horrible people.

They are lucky you don\u2019t take more than just your gift.", "NTA It was fine to disrespect you until they knew how much money they were losing. Then they were all sorry. That dress is not inappropriately colored for a white wedding. Maybe if it was solid pale pink, but with that much floral, there's no way it could be mistaken for a bride's dress. Don't waste your time with these ppl", "That dress looks absolutely lovely.  The groom\u2019s family was way out of line\u2026.I\u2019d say $1000 worth.  Don\u2019t give them the money.  Sometimes a lesson in proper manners needs to be learned the hard way.   The groom\u2019s parents can come up with the $1000 you were so generously going to give them.

What they did was horrible and childish, and the way they changed their tune once they found out how much money they were losing is disgusting. It makes sense to take the money back, and they should be grateful you showed more maturity than them and didn't start throwing drinks back or something. \n\nM refusing to apologize just makes it even worse. \n\nI saw the comments about how you interpreted A's reaction as being more innocent, and agree about doing something special for/with her, as a way of still giving her a gift.", "NTA, you did the right thing in leavening and taking back the $. What they did is simply awful.", "NTA.  I can't believe the audacity on someone's part to think that it's okay to douse someone with a drink.  And furthermore, that others would not only approve but laugh at your humiliation.  I would be done with the entirely fucking lot.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with the colour of your dress. They were being rude and spiteful. Your gift was very generous. I probably would have taken it back too", "NTA keep the money because yes it would be very helpful in this economy. One: to replace the dress they ruined? Two: to get ahead for yourself and your future.  I am sure you looked beautiful and do not let petty jealous AH bring you down to there level. But if you want to go there be epic. Find a purse or something outrageous that you know she would want buy it, enjoy it and post it all over family chat.", "NTA - Please keep your money. Use some of it to buy a new dress. The apology was only triggered by your taking away your gift, so it\u2019s not sincere. This is supported by your cousin \u201ctrying\u201d to get her husband to apologize. If he was sorry, he would have done it without you asking. Also - I wouldn\u2019t talk to A until her husband AND his mom, aunt, and sister apologize.", "NTA. I think that M and his family were probably jealous of your figure or their males looking at you. Spilling of the wine on your dress because they did not like your dress is both rude and disrespectful. A not coming to your side and agreeing with the new in-laws was also bad.\n\nNow, let's get to that sorry and fake apology they offered you. I have always seen apologies that were only offered to either mitigate damages or retain gifts as a much worse insult than the previous insult. That said, you did the right thing. They did not respect you so they do not need your gift. M not apologizing only proves the point of it being a fake apology.\n\nYou keep forging your path and doing what you want to do. Forget these awful people. Tag you cousin with this thread so she can share with her new family.", "NTA...but your cousin is going to be in for a rude awakening. Her yt husband & their family feel it's okay to treat you like this because you're Brown. I'm sure A will be facing their ire too if she hasn't already", "NTA. \n\n\nYour dress was perfectly acceptable, not even *close* to white. I\u2019m so sorry you were treated that way!", "Someone was jealous of your dress. Keep the money.", "NTA: While I'm completely unfamiliar with Indian ceremonial attire the dress you wore to the Christian ceremony seemed reasonable. It wasn't white or a reserved bridesmaid color.  They weren't having a fit over the slit (which may have been a problem in some more conservative sets).  They just thought it was too ... pale? really?  How judgmental of them.  And dousing one with wine ... no.  (well, maybe the dratted MIL that shows up in a white wedding gown to her baby boy's doooooooom but ... no).    \n\n\nThat is not how you treat a guest at your party.  That is poor hospitality.  Take your hard earned money and go live your life.", "NTA. Don't keep the peace and don't give the check even if he apologizes. Keep the money and spend on yourself.", "Keep the check and send the sister a bill for the dress. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour dress was far from inappropriate. What *was* inappropriate was some complete AH spilling wine on you ON PURPOSE. If you had worn a plain white wedding dress, i would have told you you deserved it but thats obviously not the case here.\n\nANYONE who has an issue with you taking your gift back after that can lick a scrote. Im willing to bet if someone had purposely spilled something on them, they would be upset as well and probably rethink some things.\n\nTake that money and do something nice for yourself - a spa day or a mini vacation. Or maybe just buy a replacement dress, wear it out on the town and post lots of pics saying *ope here i go being inappropriate again...*", "NTA, in any means.  \n\n\nThey humiliated you and destroyed your dress. They deserve nothing and certainly not your goodwill. If anything they should be apologizing to you.", "NTA probably jealous.  Throwing red wine on you was disgusting behavior.", "NTA and cut your cousin off. She only cared when you took the money back but before that she giggled at your shock and ire. They don\u2019t deserve your hard earn money that you have been saving.

Be ruthless and don't back down.", "NTA. Speaking as an Australian, M\u2019s family are gross. Your dress was just fine, not remotely bridal, and I\u2019m sure it suited you very well.

As PPs have suggested, I reckon that while she may not have been in on it, she definitely laughed and found it funny until she realised how much money her nasty in-laws and their little \u201cprank\u201d cost her. \n\nTell them you had to pay to fix/replace the dress they ruined and you figured taking back your generous gift was less hassle than having to take them to the small claims tribunal or pressing charges for criminal damage.", "They were jealous of you, the dress was fine.", "NTA.

Depending on how your relationship with your cousin goes, since it sounds like she was mortified about the situation too, I'd suggest whatever and whenever and if you give her *anything*, have it something that treats **only** her - like experiences you can have together, but nothing that would benefit her awful husband. \n\nYour dress looked like something I could see my boyfriend's little sister wearing to our theoretical wedding, I don't really see the issue with it and it seems like it's something that wasn't even on your cousin's radar as an \"issue.\" The only issue is that for some people, it might be a bit more flesh-colored than they'd care to wear... the photos on the website show owner photos in so many lightings, and none of them could be mistaken as \"white.\" \n\nIf you \"give\" anything, I'd suggest the bill for dry cleaning/a new dress.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Or in this case, lose good prizes.", "NTA. With a side of WTF.", "I can be just a bit petty. On that note, keep the gift. The bride & groom had no problem with his family ruining your dress & laughed about it. It's sad that his family didn't apologize until AFTER they found out the amount of your gift to them.

But you should not be giving that much money to your cousin for a wedding gift either. It is very thoughtful but not necessary. You are 18 and will need that money to get started in life.

Actually the other folks laughing were immature.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give them anything including your time or mental energy. They owe you a dress and an apology. Your cousin should be mortified she married into that mess. Block as needed", "NTA Wedding photographer here; both dresses you showed were completely appropriate for a wedding. Their behavior towards you was atrocious. My best guess is that you are stunning and they were jealous and felt you overshadowed the bride. That relationship is over. You did nothing wrong. Dumping wine on you was cruel and humiliating. They don\u2019t deserve a cent or your forgiveness.", "M and ALL his family owe you a groveling apology and dress replacement. A isn't showing up well either. Why can't she get M to apologize? Unless this was her idea. Keep your grand for yourself. NTA", "Nta. I have the same dress but in green from there. I wore it to a wedding.", "NTA, OP. If they keep demanding the money, tell them that you\u2019re soooooo sorry, but the cheque went toward replacing the dress! And a spa day. In fact, several spa days to get over the trauma they inflicted on you.\nMaybe not but definitely block with a single message before: I will not be talking to you until I receive a genuine apology, and I will be the judge of what is an acceptable apology.", "NTA\n\nI hope they enjoyed their short-lived laughter, because they certainly don't find it all that funny now.
