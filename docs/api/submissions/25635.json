Does she meet your dad's demands?", "NTA\n\nYou come across as a wonderfully smart, responsible, logical young woman (and very articulate!). Your dad is being unfair and more than a little misogynistic in his request and his attitude.\n\nAs such - and as a woman who is probably older than he is - I give you full permission if he brings this up again to LEAN IN to his own nonsense. Go full \"hormonal young woman\" and bring on the fake tears. Tell him that you're incredibly hurt and that he has really upset you by trying to make you feel embarrassed of the normal things your body is doing as a girl, and trying to make them seem dirty and shameful. Tell him that you look up to him, as your dad, and that you never thought that HE OF ALL PEOPLE would try to humiliate you by treating your perfectly normal period waste, which you carefully wrap and throw out just like snotty tissues or the products of a nosebleed, or any other unfortunate garbage . . . that he would try to make you feel gross and embarrassed instead of being the reassuring, supportive dad you've always known him to be (note: this may not actually be true, but the point here is to shame HIM, LOL). \n\nGirl, you go ahead and embarrass him, because he should be embarrassed by his behaviour. \n\nYou are NTA, and he should be proud to have such a smart, well-spoken young woman as his daughter. You go remind him of that.", "Your dad needs to mind his own business and he is too old for the passive aggressive bullshit of not feeding you breakfast. \n\nAnd did he not make breakfast for just *you*? Or did he punish your brother, *too*. (Hint, neither option is good). NTA", "NTA and your dad is exhibiting some next level passive/aggressiveness with a gross soup\u00e7on of mysogyny.  You're sure he's not a pre-teen?\n\nAnyway, maybe get your mom involved if you think she'd support you.  Obviously your brother has never said anything.\n\nIt's your dad's problem, not yours.", "When your father begins to have periods he can dispose of his products as he pleases. NTA.", "so let me get this straight: your dad wants you to go from the second floor to outside on the first floor, about six times a day, with a bloody tampon or pad wrapped in toilet paper clutched in your little hand? and he thinks this is \u2026more hygienic? nope. nta. if he\u2019s worried about hygiene he can refrain from sticking his hands in the trash like a big boy. problem solved.", "NTA - I never understand why people get so cross about this. And I don't really understand why anyone who has someone in their household who's of an age to have a period has a bathroom bin without a lid.\n\nActually scrap that,, I don't know why anyone has a bathroom bin that doesn't have a lid, why would you do that? Even if you've just got old floss in there, right?", "NTA.  Tell Dad to get a trash can with a lid for the bathroom if normal bathroom garbage bothers him so much.", "Assuming you're not waiting for days and days at a time to empty the bathroom trash can, NTA.  Your dad is unreasonable.  You are wrapping the products up, and not leaving the trash long enough for it to start stinking or anything, so there shouldn't be a problem.  Maybe getting a trashcan with a lid would help?  Maybe if he can't see it, then it won't be a problem.", "NTA, time to free bleed to show him how good he has it!", "NTA. None of his business and if he has an issue he can use the other bathroom. Why is he not brushing his teeth in his own bathroom? \n\nDoes the trash can have a lid or is it open? \nI mean your brother shares the bathroom with you and he\u2019s not bothered (since this is nothing bad) \n\nDon\u2019t think that you did anything wrong. He shouldn\u2019t be bothered by something like this at all.", "NTA. Your dad has no say in what to do with you do with your hygiene products.

Then he can dictate what happens in that bathrooms trash can. NTA", "We had 6 people living in a 700 sq foot 1 bathroom house. At one time 4 of us (mom/3 girls) were menstruating. My dad or brother never said a word.\nWtf is with all of these men?", "And these asshole parents wonder why their kids go NC and they\u2019re not allowed to see their grandchildren. NTA. Your dad is being a baby, and a prick for withholding food from you.", "NTA can your mom talk to him about this? this is an irrational request. some people use the pkg from the new one to wrap the old one in (wouldnt work with tampons tho.) another option would be to use those puppy poop bags or diaper disposal bags. youre not doing anything wrong & im not trying to imply you are, i just know how unmoving parents can be sometimes.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry your dad is behaving like *he* is the child in this situation.  You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "The trash is unhygienic? He can buy a bin with a lid, or make a cozy little menstruation hut for you if he can\u2019t be bothered with reality. What a child. \n\nNTA", "You could always offer to flush them instead, if he\u2019s rather pay thousands in plumbing bills.", "NTA: I would get it if you threw it in the trash and left it uncovered, but you\u2019re wrapping it in toilet paper. Best analogy I could think to get him to understand is, when\u2019s he sick he\u2019s got a runny nose does he up and throw every tissue in the outside bin? Cause it germs and gross, and just leaving it in the trash would be just as unhygienic as leaving a tampon/pad in the trash covered. He\u2019s being passive aggressive about something that has no affect on him unless he outright goes searching for it. You look for a problem, you\u2019ll find one. Or malicious compliance if you\u2019re like me lol I\u2019d be going out the door loudly every night that week every 2 hours to \u201cthrow out my menstrual products\u201d see how he enjoys having to hear that so often. Also making a show of every time you take it outside.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fEither way, you\u2019re NTA and your dad needs to worry about himself.", "NTA \u2014BUT Every bathroom needs a trash can with a lid.  Nobody wants to look at or smell that either.", "I (54M) have an ex that would leave her pads face up half falling out of an empty trash can and her bloody underwear laying on the floor in the bathroom and bedroom. Now you know why she is an ex. This guy has no idea how responsible OP is being. He needs to stay in his lane. NTA, quite opposite, other than the possibility of a garbage can with a lid, you have it properly figured out.", "GENTLE ESH. A pad wrapped in toilet paper still has a scent. I'm guessing the garage isn't emptied outside daily. You can wrap in toilet paper, and then a baggie with a seal. That should take care of the odor.\n\nIt's a simple issue with an easy fix.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
