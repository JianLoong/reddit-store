Oh man the stories and double standards I could go on and on about", "I was born in 95 but but my parents were a bit older when they had me. Being the youngest and only girl complicated things too. Living in a 99% catholic very red small town most of my life didn't help things because most men shared the same views. I moved away to a big city for a few years and was amazed by how different things were.", "Yeah not everyone born in the 50s was raised like a pdude Christian. My folks were born in the 40s and 50s but all my grandparents were atheist teachers and doctors so both my parents were raised to have much more healthy views of gender dynamics.", "Wow, you're a warrior for going through all this. I'd love to debate people like that just for fun but living with them sounds like hell. I'd be interested if you ever posted anything about your experiences", "Oh man same.

I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've tried. I'm actually a lead in Cybersecurity, specifically the incident response side of it and was a IT Manager for 2 years prior with 1 year of Systems Engineering and another year of being a Senior Systems Engineer all on a 2 year college degree, however, he doesn't even trust me to set up a router. Like a simple home router while I managed a whole Cisco infrastructure spanning 7 buildings while designing the infrastructure for another one when I was IT Manager. I make about 3x as much as my brother and at this point made more than my dad before he retired and yet he still doesn't believe that I could have any clue about what I'm talking about. He literally brings up things that piss me off just so he can feel superior over me at this point (my mom even agrees he does) like how when we were driving somewhere (he always has to drive, women can never drive when he's in the car) and he said that women are the reason for all accidents because if they didn't piss men off they wouldn't react so badly and cause road rage issues or something like that. But the thing is you can't debate with him because he legit will not listen to known proven facts or just yell louder if he knows he's wrong, or just change it up and say I never said that I said so and so, so he doesn't sound wrong lol. When I was in high-school I can't even begin to tell you how many times he called me lazy and stupid despite being undiagnosed adhd (which I made up according to him despite seeing now probably 8 specialists so I can get the correct medication, etc) and severe depression (mostly due to just being at home)", "Wow I'm truly sorry you had to experience that ! I had a similar experience with setting up a router in my home even though I don't have half the experience you have . My dad was yelling at me saying I did it wrong just because it was getting a while for the internet connection to start working. My brother is starting to pick up some misogynistic stuff he's been saying and it's been bothering me. \n\nIt seems like your father can't accept the fact that you as a woman can earn more and be smarter than him.

No? It's a ridiculous ask. NTA", "NTA, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with what you are doing with your used pads.  It\u2019s perfectly hygienic.

He needs to stop being such a big baby about it. Your period is not a secret shameful thing that needs to be disposed of outside on the dead of night and he needs to get over himself.

He\u2019s the asshole. Can\u2019t believe he sent you off without food because he was just being petty. It isn\u2019t unhygienic to put menstrual products in a trash can near the toilet, so long as when your period is over you take it(the trash) out.

He sat me down and went through the little leaflet in the pad packet with me twice to make sure I knew what I was doing. We were both horrified at having to do any of this.  We never talked about it again.  But yeah, men need to do better.", "NTA. He's being a jerk. Why not ask him for a wastebasket that has a lid?

Maybe because I am the one that cleans it instead of him. \n\nI don\u2019t know why he uses our bathroom, it has been like that for a while.
