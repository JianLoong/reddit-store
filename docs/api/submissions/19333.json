It's a big deal and you 100% deserve to have your own special day.  SIL can wait a little longer for her big reveal, and if she's not a raging AH, she will understand.", "NTA. She should absolutely wait for a different time rather than piggyback off of your day and achievements.", "NTA\n\nShe is sooooo far out of her lane on this.  This is your night, she can plan her own.  Let her know you are considering not even having her over tomorrow for your event the way she is talking.  Hopefully that will put her on notice to curb her desire for making an announcement.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t make you a jerk at all. I honestly have heard so many Reddit story\u2019s like that. Why do people assume so often that they can just do their shi* on other peoples celebrations. Are they fr? Like can\u2019t they find an other date to announce that? I totally understand you that you want it to be your day because IT IS. Tell her that it would be great if she wouldn\u2019t be announcing it on that exact day and if she doesn\u2019t agree I personally would say her that she\u2019s not welcome anymore on the celebration.", "NTA -- sorry for this.", "NTA\n\nGraduating is an actual accomplishment, getting pregnant and then going for an ultrasound is not. But people will be congratulating her instead of you.", "Good Lawd! She can't make phone calls. It's her third. No one cares already.", "NTA, tell her you understand her wanting to take advantage of the whole family being together to share her exciting news, but the second she does your accomplishments will be old news and your celebration will be cut short.", "NTA. If she wants a gender reveal she can plan one on a night that isn\u2019t already for someone else.", "NTA.  She is self-centered.  You should tell everybody what the gender is today, even if you don\u2019t know. 50-50 chance of getting it right lol.", "NTA. She can tell them on any of the rest of the days in the several months she has left in her pregnancy. Also, it\u2019s the third kid. At this point it\u2019s not that exciting.", "NTA, she will be stealing your day. Talk to your friends and have a backup plan. Ler her know if she does you will walk out on the entire family.  Or if she does you can ask her if they figured out who the father is.", "NTA\nShe's literally telling you that your milestone is HER platform \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f She needs to pump her brakes.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't need to wait for a special occasion, especially one that isn't connected to her. She should just call people now and tell them. doing it on \"your\" night is silly.\n\nThis \"reveal\" stuff is so weird. It's not a surprise gift box, it's simply her uterus. It's her 3rd kid too-who cares what gender it is? As long as baby is healthy, yeah!\n\nCongrats on graduating as a mama of 3! Yeah! I am so proud of you!", "NTA absolutely refuse. And make sure to save the text saying that so you can call her out when she does it anyway and your family wonders/ask you why you getting upset", "nta...but i see the logic. everyone is ariound. be honest... say you worked super hard and want thw day to be about you.", "If she means **at** the ceremony, NTA.\n\nIf after the ceremony, NAH but suggest she wait another day.", "NTA but SIL most certainly is!\n\nIf she wants to do a gender reveal she should plan her own event.  She shouldn't be hijacking someone else's celebration to garner attention.  Guessing she regularly does this type of thing.", "I don\u2019t think so it\u2019s your day it should be about you, you worked hard. She can wait a day or two to announce the gender, it\u2019s not do or die. NTA", "NTA. If it\u2019s any consolation, nobody cares what sex her baby is. She can\u2019t steal your thunder, even though it seems she\u2019s desperate to try anyway.", "NTA. She\u2019s already done this two other times and still hasn\u2019t figured out when it\u2019s appropriate to share with the entire family? Your graduation is your time to shine, not share.

I bet I'll be downvoted for this but it's not like it's your wedding, your graduation will be fully celebrated, along with that of hundreds of others.  And sex reveals are nbd anyway, people already know the baby is coming this is literally not going to compete with you.", "&#x200B;\n\nIt's so awesome you're graduating. I got my degree about the same age. However, since you are not a kid anymore, I'd hope that a day that is special and in celebration of you doesn't mean it'sYOUR DAY and that you are a PRINCESS.\n\nI'm going to say there are NAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not as this is a first baby. Not that that would make it okay to upstage your graduation.", "Wow, so what if it is HER DAY and she wants to be a princess for one day?  She has busted her butt to accomplish this while having raised 3 children. How much do you think she has really been celebrated during this time or gotten to be treated as the princess?

It doesn\u2019t seem like they have an otherwise poor relationship so why go to battle about it when you can come at the problem with understanding? \n\nHer SIL is probably just excited about her baby and not thinking clearly.

I'm salty", "Makes sense.", "1.  Yes; you said it was weird. \n2.  No.  But it\u2019s implied.

Since my other comment was deleted: (and then you got triggered and blocked me lol): saying there is nothing wrong with gender-reveal parties is in no way, \u201ccoming after\u201d you. \n6.  You attributed your unjustified aggression toward me to your long commute.  Again, don\u2019t take your traffic trauma out on me.", "No one took anything out on you.

Congrats on your graduation. And I don't really get the \"reveal\" stuff. Yeah if it was a pregnancy announcement it would be big news to announce but it's the gender, people shouldn't make a big deal about it.
