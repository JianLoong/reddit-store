Funny, but frustrating.\n\nShe was also an escape artist at home. She would LIFT each end of the dining table, side to side, to crawl through the kitchen/dining room window to get in there and grab a spoon, OPEN the locked kitchen door, then CARRY heavy wooden chairs we had locked in the kitchen, to the living room window. Then she'd pile pillows and phone books (the old giant ones) on the chair to open the living room window and drop down to the front yard, and zoom! off she'd go. This was in teh middle of the night, btw. Terrifying.\n\nGet those childproof door knob covers for ALL doors in teh home. There are stickers that separate and act as alarms.

If, for some reason, your kid runs away under your watch should your husband divorce you, or kick you out? Do you believe that those rules, and punishments apply to you, as well?\n\nYour SIL screwed up by not being aware the kid got out. She didn't call the cops fast enough, and she should have informed her brother faster. \n\nThe problem here is the kicking out. Just don't accept free babysitting again. Give her a different job. But, making her homeless over something so accidental is shitty.", "If the only reason you allowed her there is free childcare and it was a condition from you rather rhen a offer from her, alright. Your safe\n\nif thats not the case, then yeah your in the wrong, unless theres been other problems. Kicking her out in if the first scenario is not the case, is extreme. Dont let her watch rhe kid anymore if you truly believe she cajt be trusted, but dont kick her out just for this\n\nRn im going to say YTA", "Ma\u2019am, tell your husband that your son could have been killed, abducted or sexually assaulted in the time he was lost, and rather than facing the consequences and telling you the moment she was aware he wasn\u2019t in the home she waited over 1 hour.  It stopped being an honest mistake when she chose not to inform you until the police insisted.\n\n\nJames Patrick Bugler\u2019s mom was distracted for like 5 minutes.", "It really depends on your relationship otherwise. \nI mean, yeah, the situation was bad, and she made bad decisions,  in a stressful moment.\nYes, it's terrible your kid walked out of your home. But it happens to parents. It happens to nannies, it happens to anyone ever watching kids. \n\nSo, if she's otherwise a pleasant guest, and you have a good relationship with her, I would say kicking her out is overreacting. \nIf she struggles to remember to pick up after herself, has an opinion about anything that goes on in your house,  while you're letting her stay there,  she has nor remorse about the situation,  then yeah, time to get going.", "NTA - hmmmm, should we worry about an adult being on the streets or a 3 year old.  KICK HER OUT.  Husband is out of line.", "NTA!! She wouldn\u2019t have told y\u2019all if the police didn\u2019t tell her too. No telling what else has went on that y\u2019all don\u2019t know about.", "Right. After ten minutes of not being able to find him (I have a kid, they are definitely slippery) she should have called the parents", "This.. 1st call police 2nd call parents.... and if you can't be responsible for the children you are offering to care for DO NOT offer.. op NTA nicer than I would of been", "Calling the parents before the emergency line would have been a mistake. After all the parents aren't there, so what are they gonna do? So yea call the parents after the cops.\n\nBut I agree that an hour of searching was to much.", "I had a stepbrother and his wife lose their kid. They told him to take a nap, he was insisting on McDonald's. (He's autistic and that was one of the few words he could say) they set him down in bed and closed the door, then started doing other stuff in the house. He opened his window, popped out the screen, and stayed walking to McDonald's. He was only out for about ten minutes before the police found him, thankfully.\n\nHis mom opened the bedroom door and had a panic attack, then called the police who were trying to figure out who the kid belonged to. He was put in a foster situation while they were investigated for neglect. Apparently none of the fosters wanted him for more than a day because he was getting into everything and kept sneaking out. He was maybe five at the time, and the whole situation was a mess.", "I'm not sure eloped is the word you're looking for her. I'm also not sure how many pools are open in December for drowning.", "It sounds like she searched pretty close to when he got out, then she called the police when she couldn't find him. The police had found him half an hour before she called.", "I agree with you. \n\nWhar happened must have been frightening for everyone involved. We don't know the details, so it is hard to judge. In an ideal world, the adult would supervise 24/7, but things do happen, and children do run away in the blink of an eye. \nHow she handled the situation after he disappeared was not great. She may not have deliberately hidden the situation, but her working on a reactive response. \nShe wasn't trained to respond correctly in this situation. \n\nI can understand you will have trust issues after this incident, but I hope you and your sister in law manage to sort this out. I bet she also doesn't feel great about what happened.\n\nI am glad your son was found.", "This, exactly! I came here to say pretty much this, and now I don't have to type anything \ud83d\ude0a", "And how old are they?", "\u201cEscaping\u201d is extremely common, especially with young children on the spectrum. Some studies have suggested that as many as 1 in 3 children diagnosed with autism will wander off long/far enough to involve police.\n\nEven the most protective, responsible caregiver will have moments where something happens.", "Or just bad timing. When my middle kid was 2, he escaped while I was pooping. He had been napping, and just got up and wandered off. Scariest 30 min of my life.", "Since when do you need the key to unlock a door from the inside?", "15 minutes is all it took for my nephew to open the door stip naked and get half way down the block. Yes he got naked outside. They added a chain after that since he had to undo 2 locks to get outside.", "I MIGHT have called the parents first, to see if the kid likes hiding somewhere I hadn\u2019t thought of checking, but otherwise, yeah\u2026and NTA.", "That\u2019s awful. If even the foster homes were having problems with him getting out and running away then obviously it wasn\u2019t just the parent\u2019s fault/neglect. Sometimes you can do everything right & something bad still happens", "It\u2019s the right word: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandsafety/wandering.html\n\nIt does not take a pool\u2019s worth of water for a 3 year old to drown.", "1.) Elopement is absolutely the correct term, words can mean more than one thing. 2.) ponds, lakes, and rivers exist.", "At least where I'm from people generally don't fully drain their pools in winter, they just cover them with a tarp -- so there is still a drowning risk.", "Doesn\u2019t need to be a pool. Local child here drowned in a drainage ditch. \n\nAlso, depending on location, pools don\u2019t close or get covered.", "Depending where OP lives, creeks or small streams or even a ditch filled with water could be a concern. Not everyone drains their pools or cover them properly in December. And some places are still warm so people could still be in enjoying their pools.", "Eloped is in fact a word used to mean \"escaped\" or \"ran off without anyone seeing\". Prisoners, for example, can be described as having \"eloped\"", "It doesn\u2019t have to be a pool. Ponds, rivers and lakes exist, and so do large puddles.", "ooh i see, that makes more sense! thanks for clarifying", "I don't understand why anybody would downvote your comment.", "Kid and cousin went to \"explore\" and decided that \"not turning the corner\" meant they could suddenly cross the street without an adult! 3 and 4 can pass for neurotypical in good light.  Scary AF. Kid is 16 now and still remembers (and blames her cousin lol)", "It took me way too long to realize that you meant that they added the chain to the DOOR and not the KID.", "This!!!\n\nWe have mandatory high fence laws for anyone with a pool in our area for this exact reason.", "A neighborhood kid drowned in the retention pond next to my house about 20 years ago. The owners filled it with trash and dirt to prevent it from happening again. \n\nIt doesn't need to be a pool for it to happen.", "Australia?"]}
