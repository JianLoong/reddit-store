The dog got out and my brother chased after the dog. Apparently my dad didn't know for a bit but half an hour to an hour later realized he and the dog were missing. Long story short he found his way like 3 miles away to a park (imagine that, I didn't realize toddlers could go that far, but I guess the adrenaline of chasing the dog, but it was hours later) an elderly couple found him and stayed with him after they called the police, this was in Cleveland Ohio as well, so it could have been very dangerous if he wondered into the wrong areas. But anyway point is my dad didn't tell my mom until like 2001 or something and this happened in probably 1995 or 1996ish. And to this day she still brings it up and still hasn't actually forgiven him for it. One because he wasn't a great dad and wasn't actually watching us but two because he never told her until years later as a uh yeah this happened type story. It wouldn't have been great during the moment but if he told her when it was happening she would have forgiven I'm sure. So point is OP would have been mad when it was happening but there's more room for forgiveness than if they're told after it happened. They probably feel helpless that their kid was missing and couldn't even help because they didn't know, and probably also a mix of guilt for trusting their kid with someone that let them run off.", "NTA OP.

I agreed initially that searching for an hour was to much but that doesn't mean you forfeit all searches. So yea before calling the cops you have checked the whole house in maybe 15 or 20 minutes. \n\n>The 2 minutes it takes to call the parents won't make the child any more lost,\n\nSure it could. It could even save his life. How long do you think it takes for a child to be hit a car or be hurt by being someplace he shouldn't? Those 2 minutes represents streets, corners crossed and places to explore. \n\nWhile the cops are searching around the neighborhood sure then call the parents to know if they have any clue. After all if they do and the child is found then this will have been a very short hunt and a negligible amount of time wasted on it. But what if the child is still not found after the parent's guesses? Well then the police is already searching for him and they have already covered more ground than they would have if you just called them now.\n\nSo yes their opinion on if they should have been called first is invalid.", "I never actually found out, I just kinda heard that they were struggling to find a solution. Plus this was almost two decades ago!\n\nI think someone had to sit with him until he fell asleep, and then get up and quietly leave but that might have been temporary", "Twenty years ago I'm not sure how available that would have been, but it's a good idea for now!", "must not read a ton? wow, arrogant. and then you immediately contradict yourself by telling me that meaning is only used outside of books. congratulations.", "\"he just appeared out of the traffic. Come streakin' around the grease rack there, didn't have nothin' on but a smile\r  \nI looked in there, and Ethel was gettin' her a cold drink\r  \nI hollered, \"Don't look, Ethel!\" But it was too late. She'd already been mooned\"\n\nFay Stevens - The Streak", "Someone put these heavy metal storm doors and the windows had bars (now used as veggie garden trellis). No clue why as our area has always been safe. Excellent updated utilities with neighborhood road maintenance provided by the city including removal of all leaves you rake past the curb. Doors themselves are actually heavier than the house we rented a few blocks from current house. We don't have kids or plan on them. Only time is when my sister visits from FL. There's a chance of he moving back bit not until the kids are 5 & 7. She gets discounted child care through her work (teacher).", "No parent is going to keep you on the phone for hours searching fruitlessly. They'll either hang up so you can call emergency services, or they will call themselves from a second phone or something similar.\n\nYou're wrong. YOUR opinion is invalid. You're just too arrogantly ignorant to see it.", "Oh, that makes sense! Thankfully it doesn\u2019t sound like something that wasn\u2019t overly disruptive to him.", "The CDC uses the word \u201celopement\u201d in the same way as the comment above. https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandsafety/wandering.html", "Lol you keep changing the premise. Indeed no sane parents will keep the phonecall going for hours but that was never my point or even your point. So why are you bringing this up? \n\nYou said a 2 minutes phonecall will not change anything. I said otherwise with some exemples. So where is the hour long phonecall to search for a child coming from?\n\nOther than your disagreement about me calling someone else opinion invalid, what do you bring?", "You think calling the cops (who still need to actually ARRIVE at the location) would save that child from the car? You're really not very well versed in reality, are you?\n\nIt's late. You're stupid. And I have better things to do. Bye."]}
