We had a ton of early money arguments and agreed that we would keep to a household budget. Also, he agreed to pay down his credit card debt. I have more flexibility in my personal spending than he does.\n\nEarly after we moved in, my bf told me that as a kid he always wanted to live in one of the houses that were totally decorated for trick or treat and handed out full size candy.\n\nHere's where I messed up. I took this as a comment and not a plan. When the end of September came, we went to the halloween store, and he was under the impression we had savings for this. I didn't know. We go over the monthly budget together, and it was never listed. When he found out that there was no halloween savings, we had an argument.\n\nAfterwards I talked to friends who all said he had talked about trick or treat extensively and how much it meant. I chalked this one up to a misunderstanding on my part. So I came up with $500 my money, and went to him with an apology.\n\nHe decided to buy one big piece, an animatronic clown and some lights. It burned through the $500, plus he put a little on his own credit card.\n\nHe wanted another big piece and was mad I wouldn't put it on my credit card. I asked if he wanted to put up handmade decorations or spider webs but he said it would look cheap.\n\nA few weeks later, we had a fight over candy. He was still stuck on buying full size bars. We easily get over 250 trick or treaters and I said we just don't have that much money. So we got the bulk bags of good small bars. I also had these little coloring books for the allergy and diabetes kids.\n\nJump forward to Halloween. Early kids show up and he is letting them grab handfuls. I remind him we have a ton of trick or treaters coming, and he got really annoyed. I had ordered a pizza for us. So I get it and go inside for about 10 minutes. By the time I came back out, the trick or treat bowls were empty. He had been dumping a third of a bowl in each kids bag and had given out all the coloring books to whatever kids came along.\n\nHe told me that I'd have to go run out and buy more candy on my credit card. I said I wasn't going to do that, and it wasn't my fault he just handed out 20 pounds of candy. He started yelling right there in front of the kids, and I told him to come inside. He responded that he wasn't stopping trick or treating even if there was no candy. I told him to have fun with the clown, and went inside.\n\nHe came in 15 minutes later. Then he demanded that I leave for the night so that he could clear his head. He argued it was fair because I had already eaten and it was my fault that trick or treat was ruined bc I'm cheap. I handed the rest of the pizza at him and refused\n\nHe left and went to a friend's house and I guess they spent the rest of the night drinking, handing out trick or treat candy and texting me how awful and cheap I am.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667398699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk6gn2/aita_for_choosing_my_budget_over_my_boyfriend/", "score": 10247, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nName-calling, slurs and insults will earn you a ban.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "NTA and you need to run from this man.

He gaslit you into thinking that you messed up somehow. You didnt. The only mistake that you did was have him as a boyfriend. And then let him move in with you. Now that I think of it, you messed up quite a bit. You shouldn't have listened to his friends. Another mistake there. Also by paying for ANY of the stuff. Not your monkeys, not your circus as the saying goes. What you taught him is that he can guilt you into submission. And he will keep doing it as long as you let him. Another mistake would be letting him back into your life and your house. He's a walking red flag \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 and you will keep messing up if you don't see that. \n\n3.

In what universe does that make sense?\n\n5. He wanted YOU to LEAVE YOUR OWN HOUSE!!! How can you not see the red flags here? \n\nHow to clean up your mess:\n\n1.

I get that a big Halloween is something he's always wanted to do but guess what? Everyone has stuff they've always wanted to do but can't due to their finances.

I want to see this $500 clown though! \ud83d\ude02", "**NTA**\n\nBut I would gently suggest that this is the end of this relationship, for two reasons that are not at all negligible: \n\n1) Your boyfriend is nearly 30 years old and DEEPLY financially irresponsible, and has no interest in changing. The former wouldn't be a relationship ender NECESSARILY, but the latter is. You cannot built a life - or rather you shouldn't - with someone who has no problem not only being in debt but putting you in serious debt for frivolous things. It would be different if he just didn't understand how to take care of his finances, but he has made clear that whether it's a matter of ignorance or just irresponsibility, he is indifferent. He doesn't care. You seem really smart and responsible. I don't think you want to build a life with someone who will not only happily ruin your credit and saddle you with enormous debts on a whim, but who will BE CRUEL AND BERATE YOU for trying to be have more responsibly.  Which brings us to...\n\n2) Your boyfriend is quite open about the fact that he doesn't care about you, your feelings, your perspective (even on important things like debt), or the hard work that you put into managing your finances responsibly, except to the extent that it means that you have money available for him to spend as he wishes . . . which is mostly irresponsibly and frivolously, and without taking long term consequences into consideration at all. You deserve better. You are not an ATM, and you are not a punching bag to be told off because you asked him very reasonably to behave like an adult (i.e. we all have things we've always wanted to do . . . sometimes we are not in a financial position to do them, or they have to be amended to be done within our means), and he just didn't want to and didn't care. \n\nYou are worth so much more than this - and I don't mean financially. This man does not value you as a partner or a person at all. He is impulsive and irresponsible, but the worst part is that HE DOESN'T CARE, AND HE IS CRUEL TO YOU ABOUT IT. \n\nNTA, but please take some time and think seriously about whether this is the sort of person you want to anchor yourself to in the long term. You deserve so, so much better.", "NTA reddit banned me for describing someone's BF they way i want to describe yours so will be as clinical as possible, he is an adult male who behaves like a prepubescent juvenile. Its nice to want those things but you...pardon me HE should be saving up for them.You might want to rethink this situation he burnt through $500.00 when he could have spread that out for practical or handmade decorations, He doesn't know how to manage finances. Im assuming he's not paying rent and has the nerve to call you cheap then had the gall to demand you leave YOUR house so he can cool off and instead he text bpmbs you telling you how awful you are!

Yes, there was some miscommunication but you more than made up for it by providing $500. That should have been MORE than enough to deck the house out. And in reality, after this Halloween you\u2019d have known to budget more so you could add to the decor next year. \n\nHis behavior and attitude in handing out the candy was absolutely gross and ridiculous. If he was so hellbent on providing full/king size candy bars then he needed to have pulled money from his own pocket to do so. Instead he demanded it from you as though you were an ATM. And to tell you to leave YOUR OWN house!? Oh hell no.\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d rethink the relationship because  it sounds as though the two of you do not share the same financial mindset.", "NTA\nThe grown-ass man costume obviously doesn't fit this child; dump him.

We had a ton of early money arguments and agreed that we would keep to a household budget. Also, he agreed to pay down his credit card debt. I have more flexibility in my personal spending than he does.\n\nEarly after we moved in, my bf told me that as a kid he always wanted to live in one of the houses that were totally decorated for trick or treat and handed out full size candy.\n\nHere's where I messed up. I took this as a comment and not a plan. When the end of September came, we went to the halloween store, and he was under the impression we had savings for this. I didn't know. We go over the monthly budget together, and it was never listed. When he found out that there was no halloween savings, we had an argument.\n\nAfterwards I talked to friends who all said he had talked about trick or treat extensively and how much it meant. I chalked this one up to a misunderstanding on my part. So I came up with $500 my money, and went to him with an apology.\n\nHe decided to buy one big piece, an animatronic clown and some lights. It burned through the $500, plus he put a little on his own credit card.\n\nHe wanted another big piece and was mad I wouldn't put it on my credit card. I asked if he wanted to put up handmade decorations or spider webs but he said it would look cheap.\n\nA few weeks later, we had a fight over candy. He was still stuck on buying full size bars. We easily get over 250 trick or treaters and I said we just don't have that much money. So we got the bulk bags of good small bars. I also had these little coloring books for the allergy and diabetes kids.\n\nJump forward to Halloween. Early kids show up and he is letting them grab handfuls. I remind him we have a ton of trick or treaters coming, and he got really annoyed. I had ordered a pizza for us. So I get it and go inside for about 10 minutes. By the time I came back out, the trick or treat bowls were empty. He had been dumping a third of a bowl in each kids bag and had given out all the coloring books to whatever kids came along.\n\nHe told me that I'd have to go run out and buy more candy on my credit card. I said I wasn't going to do that, and it wasn't my fault he just handed out 20 pounds of candy. He started yelling right there in front of the kids, and I told him to come inside. He responded that he wasn't stopping trick or treating even if there was no candy. I told him to have fun with the clown, and went inside.\n\nHe came in 15 minutes later. Then he demanded that I leave for the night so that he could clear his head. He argued it was fair because I had already eaten and it was my fault that trick or treat was ruined bc I'm cheap. I handed the rest of the pizza at him and refused\n\nHe left and went to a friend's house and I guess they spent the rest of the night drinking, handing out trick or treat candy and texting me how awful and cheap I am.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can promise it doesn\u2019t feel good.\n\nAnd seriously\u2026 yelling at someone in public in general is horrific. Yelling at someone in front of children? Nah.", "Also to add, he wants to always be the cake bringer but never the cake maker. This type of personality trait will only get worse the more OP let's him treat her as a personal atm and hotel.", "not only that but he lacks impulse control, thinks he can order op to leave HER house, and has the maturity of a 5 yr, please op kick him out you deserve better NTA", "Also, he asked you to leave the house YOU OWN!", "My response to his desire in the first place would be \u201cthat\u2019s something we can aim to work towards down the road. Right now we still don\u2019t have that kind of money.\u201d You don\u2019t go from bare lawn to haunted house in one year. People that love Halloween often buy one animatronic a year. They usually have a decade\u2019s worth of stuff in storage. OPs boyfriend is way out to lunch on his expectations, *especially* the one he has of her just footing the bill for his daydreams.", "Piggybacking, he dares opens up a credit card in her name? Fraud charge & identity thefttttt! There\u2019s no trick or treating in jail!\n\nEdit: also, thwart squatting rights and formally evict him", "> I think it's time for your bf to move back out if your house until he gets his sh*t /expectations toghether. \n\nFrom his tantrum to later having his friends join in on harassing OP via text, I consider this moron permanently ousted and demoted to the status of \"Ex\".", "OP, in case it's not clear, you have ALL of our permission to break up with this dude yesterday.", "That thing is hideous and not in a good way. You can do a lot with lights, spider webs, and homemade decor. I get a lot of compliments on my Halloween decor but I've made a lot of it myself for cheap or gotten items on sale.", "Well at least he spent the money on a quality product that will last for years to come! /s", "That is one of the ugliest and tackiest decorations I've ever seen. Dude has no money OR taste. NTA he is a fucking leech.", "AND THAT DIDN'T EVEN PAY FOR ANY OF THE CANDY", "What\u2019s yours is mine, what\u2019s mine is mine!", "As if the tantrums and money conflicts weren't bad enough, he orders her to leave her own house!    Who knows what he would have done if she had. Trashed her place, changed the lock. SMH \n\n**NTA OP**, but think about this for a while. Maybe consider a couples counselor to determine how he views relationships, responsibility, and money.", "I would have laughed in his face so hard, told him to get out of MY house, and that if he's going to be so rude he can just stay out.", "Agreed. He\u2019s disrespectful yelling at her and telling her to leave her house for the night. He\u2019s financially irresponsible. Worse, he\u2019s a gold digger.", "Or a pretty lawn.", "To be honest that sounded sketch as hell. What if she leaves and he trashes the place? Or changes locks? Yes she could get back in but at what cost?\n\nThis is no man, this is a child. He is either some kind of raging narcissist or someone that has no emotional maturity at all. It doesn't matter, OP is not his mommy.\n\nTell your bf to get the hell out of your house. Ask one of your friends to be with you, because to be honest he sounds violent. Tell him that he is the cheap one, you don't care about Halloween and yet you put a lot of money into, while he says he cares and he barely did a thing, he wasn't even mature enough to bring it up while you were planning the monthly budget. So no, Halloween is not important for him.\n\nAlso if a holiday is truly important to you, you can have hell of a time spending almost nothing. A lot of people talk that holidays are pure business but that is only the case if you make it pure business. Yes you can buy stuff, but the holidays are not about buying stuff, they are about having fun, enjoying with friends and family, making memories, etc. And you can do all that with little money. You don't need to ditch 750 dollars to make an amazing Halloween.\n\nNTA. But if you stay with this guy you will be an ah to yourself.", "Be careful regarding your house. Make him sign some sort of cohabitation agreement so you don\u2019t end up in a common law partnership situation where you have to financially support him if/when (hopefully) you split. It sounds like your bf is a trick and no treat.", "Also the fact that she gave him **$500** and he spent it all on **one decoration**. Having just helped my mom decorate for a truly extravagant Halloween party, I can say with certainty that while decorations can get expensive, they're not that expensive. If it was really so important to him to have full-size candy bars and tons of decorations, then he should've been efficient with the money OP gave him. It takes like $10 to cover even a large front porch or bushes in spiderwebs. It takes another $50 or so to get a ton of styrofoam skulls and graves and some orange lights. He could've spent all the rest on candy and been able to give out as much as he wanted.\n\nOP, you need to ditch this boyfriend. Not only does he not respect you or your money, he has absolutely no ability to exercise any kind of self-control. Halloween decorations are tons of fun, but they're not a necessity. And *Halloween* is tons of fun, but it comes literally every year. He has the rest of his life to build an arsenal of awesome decorations so that eventually, he does live in the most kickass trick-or-treating house. But instead of making any kind of plan to make that happen, he expects you to just magically produce money so he can have exactly what he wants right now. That's not how a 29-year-old man behaves, that's how a toddler who doesn't understand money or the passage of time behaves. Drop him and get him the hell out of your life.", "Also a hint for perspective: the actual people with money don't spend a shit ton on seasonal decorations and giving away candy. They buy the cheap candy so less people come, maybe put out a pumpkin or some cheap decorations they got on clearance last year and use the money to have brick pavers put in or carriage lights or something else that adds long term value to their property. My parents live on  the road in town where all the doctors and dentists live. No one trick or treats on their street. The long walk down the winding dark driveways isn't worth the Smarties.", "Halloween is my favorite holiday and I really don\u2019t celebrate other holidays. I spend what most would say is too much money on Halloween, even when almost everything is handmade.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, I know I\u2019m going to spend a lot of money and I save all year long for it. I plan for the expense because it\u2019s important to me. I\u2019ve had years that I wasn\u2019t able to do as much because of money, so I toned it down a bit. \n\nI told my boyfriend in the beginning of my relationship that I go all out for Halloween and spend a lot of money. Now that we live together, we have a Halloween savings for when the next year rolls around (I contribute more since it\u2019s more my thing).\n\nIf it was that important to the boyfriend, HE should have saved. HE should have made it clear of what he wants for Halloween and discussed HIS budget with OP. If HE didn\u2019t have the money, HE could\u2019ve saved what HE could\u2019ve and continued to build up to the dream Halloween over the next few years. \n\nInstead, he mooched off OP and threw a temper tantrum when she didn\u2019t give in. NTA OP, but your boyfriend is certainly an immature leach kind of A H. I\u2019d keep the decorations and kick him to the curb.", "Yeah, that's what I get hung up on. He keeps expecting OP to increase her credit card debt so he can keep getting cool shit. Also, 500 for one decoration? There is *so much* they could have made with that if they had made decorations and it could have been so cool! They are plenty of folks who make amazing budget Halloween decorations. But BF would have to be willing to actually work for it.", "Yea babe let\u2019s drop 2k on Halloween decorations!\nYea seriously though the way he is behaving is worrisome to say the least. You never know when a hidden expense may pop up. I\u2019d rather have money and the option to buy some crazy than just have a bunch of stuff lying around cluttering my space. It\u2019s really awesome that you are so organized with money\u2026.you are going to be so much better off in the future. I would straight up dump this guy\u2026.this is just over the top ridiculous.", "This is not helpful to OP but I live in an area where just a town over there's a house that has its own radio station and their lights are synced up to it so every year you can drive up to the house and watch the show while listening to the music and it's freaking awesome\n\nI've never heard of anywhere else that does that", "Yeah, the thing with those types of houses is that generally they spend *years* building it up. You buy one or two new things each year, especially if you do it after the holiday on clearance, and eventually you'll have a massive, amazing display. But I don't know of anyone who's just spent thousands in one go for that. Same with the giant candy bars, I assume those people likely buy them in bulk for cheaper, and/or buy a handful every payday for so many weeks beforehand. If BF wanted to do that and work up to his dream it would be very doable. But this was completely unreasonable of him.", " Or start planning for next year. We have sims cool decorations that we have accumulated over the years, usually buying them at Goodwill or in November.", "Also I have dreams dependent on money that I know I won\u2019t have in my late 20s/early 30s and it will take time to get there. Can it not wait one year?!", "Same.\n\nAnd if I buy before christmas, I pretty much only buy them on sale too unless it's something I am confident will not come back and will probably sell out. \n\nI got one of our inflatables for a really good price after Christmas. \n\nI do pay full price for some of our tree ornaments, but the nicer ones are either Hallmark or hand blown glass and those rarely go on sale.", "Bonus: I always forget what ornaments I bought during Boxing Week, so it's a fun surprise when I go to decorate the tree the next year.", "Also it's not like he's saying \"oh, I need to get better at this\", he's yelling at her for not enabling his poor money management.", "Except for him it\u2019s not a costume.", "ICP: Irresponsible Clown Payments", "Or better yet return both and see how much money and space she regains. NTA but you would be to yourself if you stay with Mr.BigSpenderofYOURmoney", "I've been in my house for 3 years and while we only have about a dozen families with kids the whole neighborhood is like a 1/2 mile loop off a much bigger one. We never get trick or treaters and it makes me kind of sad because we've got the good setup where you don't have to go up and down each driveway. You could just do our little loop and hit like 80 houses.", "Thanks it\u2019s my first one!!!"]}
