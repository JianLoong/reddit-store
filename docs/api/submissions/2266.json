My parents have been more than able to pay for my attending university, and in addition to that, I have found a part-time job to work during the school year that gives me enough money to pay for things like extra food, video games, etc. However, I am unable to work at this job over the break.

I asked my dad if something had happened to them, and he told me plainly that nothing had changed. He also told me that he was indifferent to whether or not I worked over the break, as long as he was able to see me.
