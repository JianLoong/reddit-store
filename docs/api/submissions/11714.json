This long-term visitor should give you more than a \"thank you\". Personally, I would rather be rid of a freeloading guest than to keep them and receive a thank you, but that's me.", "NTA.  Your relative overstayed their welcome.  Your parents' miscommunication got that person to, finally, move. You got what you wanted: your house back.\n\nAs regards their lack of gratitude, if they have any class, they'll thank you after they've calmed down. They should also apologize for staying so long; but that might be expecting too much.\n\nTake you win, and get on with things.", "NTA But I hope you noticed that your parents' \"miscommunication\" deflected blame from them to the houseguest when you complained that your parents failed to do something. Nonetheless, the houseguest who actually uttered the words \"how dare you\" (do anything in your own house)? Don't give them a reason to unpack their bags. Take this opportunity to let them leave.", "NTA I don\u2019t know ages here, but please don\u2019t let people take advantage of you like this. I don\u2019t know where you live, and I know there is a housing shortage, but if you were going to have someone living with you for a year, you could have at least not lost money ( utility use at the very least) YOU had every right to ask them about moving long ago.", "NTA. I guess it is unpleasant for a moocher to be told that they will be allowed to mooch no more. If the relative paid their way, they are less of a moocher, but still, to let 2 weeks extend into a year is too much.", "NTA. If you were okay with it, I think it\u2019s fine that they wanted to stay a while, but ought to pay you rent. Especially because they are making a high salary and could easily afford it. They should be more grateful and stop freeloading.", "I'm confused about the question here. The title and what you provided as an explanation as to why you may be the AH don't really align... \n\nYou did or didn't complain about this person? Or were you complaining about your family member? \nWhen did the \"expect a thank you\" come into play at all? \n\nAll I can really say here, is that your family member who said you've never done anything for them and \"How dare you say I need to move out\" - is kind of bonkers, as they've lived with you for a year and it is your house. That's clearly something. But that makes me think - either they're very entitled, or they've been paying their way, and paying a decent amount that has also benefitted you - i.e you haven't let them crash for a year for free or for chump change. You have made a decent profit, or have been able to save quite a bit, or have had some decent benefit of them staying there. (Even if this is the case - it's still your home and you of course have a right to ask them to leave, and it's still SOMETHING good you've done to let them stay there)\n\nI know it was a misunderstanding, but I imagine it would be crappy to hear that you were complaining about them and that they needed to move out from your parents and not you. That would make most people feel uncomfortable and potentially upset. Even after it was cleared up, that uncomfortableness. You are now expecting a thank you, so you are saying you never complained but clearly you are to some extent, right? \n\nI am unclear what you think might make you the AH so I can't answer.", "NTA but don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Looks like this will finally get them off their butt and out of your house so it seems like a win to me!", "Wtf did I just read. Kick them all out, said relative can pay for your parents to live with them for a year, if they're so close. NTA, take your space back.", "INFO = Was this family member helping out around the house, paying rent and contributing to the household? Or were you just letting them live in your place for free and they do nothing?", "NTA.  I was in a position similar to this a few years ago with some family members of mine-a married couple who didn't know the meaning of the word \"contraceptive\" and had so many kids they couldn't afford to live by themselves, so my parents invite them to live with us rent free.\n\nThe oldest kid stole from us, and the rest were really bratty never having been told \"no\" a day in their lives.  It helped me decide to be childfree and relationship free.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While I feel like there is something missing here from the full story possibly, with the information that I have I would say that they are feeling some type of way themselves whether its guilt or what for being there for so long, that caused them to get defensive of the situation.

If so, yes it would have been better to tell this person directly. It sucks hearing things from someone else, especially since your parents twister your words so much. \n\nThis person blew up after a misunderstanding- but now you know how they feel. They feel crashing rent free with you is nothing - like It's not a favor you've done at all. They also don't think you have a right to ask them to leave, because they feel entitled to your house.

If they don't move out on their own I would highly recommend you put a ticking clock on it. 60 days to find a place.", "Because you allow that unappreciative and lack of compensating behavior.
