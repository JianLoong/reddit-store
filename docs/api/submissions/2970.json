It's a complicated story. He's been with me since he was 5 and calls me Uncle Mike. \n\nHis teacher, Miss L, has been complaining about his behavior. I asked for examples and then asked her if other boys in her class displayed the same behavior because it sounds like typical 3rd grade boy behavior (ie not paying attention, talking too much).\n\nWe really weren't making any progress until she asked me about Aidan's home life. I thought she was going to ask about his sleeping habits. She said \"well meant about his parents.\"\n\nI asked her if this whole thing was an excuse to dig for personal information and if it was, then she's a sorry excuse for a teacher and a human being. \n\nShe was taken aback by my comment and said she didn't know if there was something she should know about. I told her if she has something to say, then say it. Do not waste my time by asking to meet me under false pretenses just so you can fish out why I'm raising my nephew. It's none of her business.\n\nShe said she'd try again when I was not so emotional and I said try again when you're not so nosy.\n\nToday she apologized for everything and said there was no excuse for \"knowing things\" that she didn't need to know. She said she wanted to start over. I think she expected me to apologize and I didn't. I told her I don't hold grudges and apology accepted.\n\nMy brother and his partner adopted Aidan at birth. Both of them are away for a very long time. I wasn't going to let Aidan go into foster care so I took him in.

Definitely YTA.", "YTA\n\nIn majority of cases with children and school, there's a direct correlation between how they behave in school and their home life. The teacher is trying to understand the child.\n\nThis post also lacks a great deal of context such as details of the conversation and the actual behavior of the child. Without anything else, it sounds like you got defensive for no reason.", "YTA. I think you jumped to that conclusion quickly and I think most teachers when behavior is questioned ask about the home life", "YTA\n\nDude, if the kid is acting out in class and the teacher thinks it\u2019s connected to his home life and his parents, then letting the teacher know what\u2019s going on will help the teacher know how how to accommodate Aidan.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re doing family trees or class work involving parents, and that makes Aidan act out more.  So that\u2019s why the teacher made the connection.\n\nRefusing to tell the teacher anything is just hurting Aidan.", " She\u2019s a teacher, you don\u2019t think she knows what typical boy behavior is? She sees he is struggling and she is asking if something is going on so she could provide further assistance.  You\u2019re being mean  for no reason", "Damn. The teacher was looking for insight so she could work with him more effectively and you chose to respond with belligerence. YTA.", "I mean I feel like a lot of this comes down to things like tone and subtext, but leaning towards YTA.\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable for a teacher to ask about home life to understand their students better. Honestly I think this is fine even if there's no problems. It would help her be more sensitive to Aidan's particular circumstances, particularly if things like home and family come up in class.\n\nThey can ask, you don't have to answer. You can just say it's private and you would prefer not to discuss it. Getting hostile and accusing her like that sounds like you got very aggressive for no reason. \n\nI'm guessing (?) you've had bad experiences with gossip before, so maybe that's why it felt like such a sensitive issue, and if so I'm sorry about that. But nothing you've said here gives the impression she was asking anything other than normal questions to help her do her job.", "YTA. You say his parents are \"away for a very long time\". I'm making a giant leap here and thinking you mean prison. If so, it might be helpful for her to know, because with all the things in the news, other kids may be talking about \"bad people in jail\", etc. Also, your nephew may be very well adjusted, for which I applaud you, but it is more likely he has some feelings about his parents being away and needs someone to talk to when other kids are talking about their families & parents and keeping the teacher \"in the loop\" can help her let you know when she notices things that are negatively affecting him. If she asked to speak with you she is likely noticing \"things\", but they may be subtle signs that are hard to pinpoint and articulate. \n\nYou seem to be treating her as the enemy, when she is just trying to be an ally and do what is best for your nephew.", "YTA. Sounds like you have a huge chip on your shoulder about your situation, and maybe you should do some self-reflection to figure out why. The teacher asked a VERY valid question, one that if she knew the answer to it could help her better understand your nephew and how better to help him. You owe her a huge apology. YTA.", "YTA. The teacher is trying to help your child. Knowing his background can be very helpful and enlightening.\n\nShe is not trying to \"fish\" information. She is trying to understand why your child his acting the way he acts so she can plan her interventions betters and make sure she doesn't make thing worst by making bad interventions with him\n\nStop fighting her : she is not your enemy, she is your ally.\n\nEdit: so tired of people saying that the teacher is being nosy. The teacher was trying to get more info in order to do better interventions with the kids. If a kid is having a bad behaviour because he is rotten spoiled and his parents are assholes, her interventions will be more stern and punitive. If the kids misbehaved on a monday, and the teacher knows very well that the kid just spent a traumatic weekend with her abusive parents, then she will use patience and kindness with him. \n\nThe way you handle an entitled child IS NOT the same way you handle a traumatized child.", "YTA. It sounds like you're very sensitive about him, both about his behavior and his origins. When the teacher called you with behavior concerns, you clearly didn't believe her and pushed back with your personal narrative that it's normal for his age. But it's not-- teachers don't call home about normal behavior. It doesn't mean your kiddo is 'bad,' it means they need help and support. \n\nThen when the teacher asked if there's anything going on at home that might be affecting your kid's behavior, you got aggressive and insulting. It's not being nosy--knowing about their home situation can help a teacher provide the right kind of support. They can try to notice if there's a connection between a kid acting out and mentions of parents in books or by other kids. They can listen in to see if some of the things other kids are saying might hit an extra nerve with your kid because of their situation, and correct it. They can get the school counselor involved if the kid needs somebody to talk to. \n\nOn top of that, you're consistently arguing with judgments, which is against the sub rules.", "YTA. She had concerns and, rather than punish your nephew, she was trying to get to the root of the issues and actually help him. If he was struggling at home or had something emotional going on, she could offer accommodations that might be more effective than punishments.", "YTA---shes trying to help. Shes asking about his home life because thats often a cause of behavioral issues at school (which you dont seem to want to take seriously)", "YTA. You are telling us internet strangers the facts, but not your nephews teacher.\n\nWe don't really care, she would.", "**THIS WAS POSTED BEFORE**", "You shared his circumstances with all of us. Curious why that was too much to share with his teacher?", "Teacher got their answer anyways...", "YTA \n\nI am a person who works in schools daily. \n\nIf the child misses their parents, has witnessed violence, knows their parents are away in prison, parents are away on vacation, etc. it IS relevant! \n\nWhy? Because then we can help determine if a child\u2019s behaviour is more emotional rather than having a learning problem. \n\nYou can say to the teacher: \u201cwhat I say is in confidence- not to be discussed in classroom or with others unless they are directly working with my nephew.\u201d It should not be on their record if you are concerned about privacy. \n\nYou are directly hindering your nephew from\ngetting help. When teachers know parents are away on vacation or for whatever reason, extra compassion, patience and if needed, more focus goes into this child. It definitely helps to know what\u2019s happening at home so that we can see if our lesson plans can be geared towards helping this child (and everyone around them). \n\nAt my school, we have done nutrition lesson plans because it was needed for a few students so that all could understand how different types of food originate from different countries and are a part of one\u2019s culture. Parents were happy this was part of our classwork. \n\nWe have done lesson plans regarding different family backgrounds and anti-bullying to help fight against racism and prejudice in the classroom. Parents had been involved and were happy the children were receiving this type of education. \n\nWe have even done lessons on diabetes and the student who had it wished to read a book to the class about it. Parents had wanted this also. \n\nAt my school, students have access to counselling and other services and extra help with reading etc. The teacher needs to know the details and maybe your nephew may be eligible for extra services etc. you don\u2019t know that. \n\nTeachers and school staff make a home away from home for kids. All details are relevant and help shape the work students do in class, and the interactions of the humans around them at times. \n\nIf you are the only parent your nephew has known, then it\u2019s different, it\u2019s a single parent home and no trauma etc. and still then you can discuss how your nephew is doing at home and hobbies they have. I would re-do the meeting with the teacher. It sounds like they are trying to help. When you give in this case, your nephew will receive.", "If his behavior is just fine why were you meeting with her about him? Really parent teacher conferences. Talked to her in passing? If the meeting is specifically about his behavior then maybe you should reevaluate his behavior.", "Info:\n\nare you and your son (do you consider him your son? Is there a chance that after this \"long time\" he will be reunited with his parents? Does he think that?) in therapy or receiving support in some way? He had 5 years with his parents and then something traumatic happened and he was taken in by you. It's a BIG DEAL for a child, even if you are a loving and attentive parent now.\n\nI can tell, and obviously so can the teacher now, that you are incredibly defensive about this. Being defensive isn't helping anyone. Your kid needs a little help with his behavior at school. This is normal but it also can be exacerbated by his transition to your care. So if someone is facilitating your relationship (a caseworker, a therapist, etc) it might be a good idea to talk to them about how to handle questions from school.", "YTA. What\u2019s going on at home can certainly impact how a child behaves in school. Maybe she was asking to gain insight re: how he\u2019s been acting out in class and see if there are way she or the school can support him. It sounds like you got defensive rather quickly.", "YTA\nA caring teacher will ask about home life out of concern. They only want to help the child. You are also assuming his behavior is normal and that of any other child his age when obviously the teacher is bringing it to your attention because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s your responsibility to guide your nephew and correct behavioral problems, not disregard them.", "OP, it is not unusual for a teacher to ask questions about a student\u2019s home life in order to better understand and support them in the classroom. It is **normal** for a teacher to do this. It is not an accusation against you or anyone else in the child\u2019s family. The teacher was asking for your help because you both need to work together to support the child. You are on the same side here.\n\nIf you feel she wasn\u2019t clear enough about the behavioral problems she was seeing, just ask her to clarify. Ask her again if you still don\u2019t get it. **Assume good intentions.** You are raising a child and you need allies. The child\u2019s teacher is almost certainly trying to be one, so give her a chance.\n\nNAH because you are trying to do the right thing by raising a child that is not your own and you are probably under a lot of pressure. But please rethink your attitude here.", "YTA, first and foremost, no most boys are not disruptive in class, which is what the teacher was trying in a diplomatic way to tell you. Understanding the reasons behind this disruptive behavior will help the teacher work with your nephew in controlling his behavior better. Your job as the guardian is to help this child, not make excuses for or ignore behaviors that in the long run will result in disciplinary actions for him. While it's understandable that you may not want to give to many details surrounding why his parents are \"away\" for an extended period of time, but your nephew is being disrespectful to both his teacher and classmates with his actions that you are excusing as boys will be boys behavior. And given your over reaction here, it is understandable where he gets the attitude from. So, you have a choice here, be an adult and do what is actually in the best interest of the child and figure out how to teach him not to be disruptive and disrespectful whether with the help of his teacher or a counselor. Or get ready for many more meetings where your nephew is escalating his behaviors for attention to the point he is no longer welcome at school.", "YTA. Teachers ask these questions because situations at home came affect the way a child behaves in class. She may also be trying to get feedback about his home behaviour so she can have a better picture of your nephew. If she suspects ADHD, ODD, other neurodivergence\u2019s, learning disabilities or even mild anxiety and depression, she needs a full picture of your nephew\u2019s life and behaviour before she can start the process of making his life at school smoother but getting him the tools and help he may need to succeed. \n\nYou\u2019re also ignoring the fact that his behaviour in class is such, that she has brought it to your attention. Teachers don\u2019t normally bring, not paying attention or talking too much in class, to a parent or guardian\u2019s attention unless it is causing an issue in the classroom and is affecting the student\u2019s ability to learn. The fact she has noticed these issues, is making you aware of them and trying to understand where these behaviours are coming from shows she has an invested interest in your nephew\u2019s learning and wants him to be successful at school.", "Edit: YTA\n\nit's reasonable for a teacher to ask about home life as it can and does affect kids at school. They maybe don't need to  ALL of the details (Like WHERE his parents are or WHY they are away... but maybe helpful for them to understand yes they are away and whether or not they're in contact).\n\nMaybe she is just nosy, but more likely she just genuinely cares about her students and noticed he was off. I can't imagine a whole lot would change in the classroom, how she teaches, etc but they could offer a guidance counselor, offer more support, be more sensitive about certain subjects, maybe offer more leniency or understanding about shit that may be affecting him. \n\nMy son is only 3 but I would let his daycare know about changes at home, like if a grandparent passed away, Dad moved out of the house, new sibling, etc.. anything that could affect how he is acting. Once I had to remove someone from his emergency contact sheet and while I didn't explain why, they needed to know it'd be a problem if that person showed up trying to pick up my son and I made sure that was clear. \n\n Teachers also are mandated reporters, so if they notice the kids saying something or showing signs of neglect, abuse, etc they need to report it. Sounds like you've been the legal gaurdian for awhile, so this is unlikely the case but if a teacher overheard a child say they've been staying with an Uncle or someone different than who is listed like Mom and Dad and they still had the parents listed as gaurdians then it would raise a red flag as to \"why aren't they with Mom and Dad or is there an issue at home that I need to report?\" If the teacher had been referring to Mom and Dad this whole time as if the child still sees and talks to them regularly, it'd be nice if they knew the child hasn't seen them in years or if they haven't even talked before. \n\n\nIf you think your nephew isn't affected by his parents being gone for years and changing his home/gaurdian at age 5 - you are in denial. If you think home life doesn't affect kids at school, you are in denial. He may be handling it well, but I still I think you were an AH to the teacher. You didn't have to tell her specific details or spill the tea/gossip, but a general of \"no he's been fine at home\" or \"yeah he is still missing them or having a hard time with them being gone\" etc. Maybe explain how long he's lived with you, how long his parents are away for, whether or not that is changing soon, if he talks to them at all, etc. Or simply say \"he came into my custody 3 years ago\". Whatever.  It's clearly is a sensitive subject since you reacted this way but you did your nephew no favors.", "So his teacher *cared enough* to ask about your nephew's home life and you assumed she was being \"nosy\" because... why? Your circumstances are just that interesting?\n\nI can almost guarantee she was asking out of professional concern and is probably understating his difficulties in the classroom in order not to awake your ire. A lot of teachers have to be very diplomatic these days due to parents taking offence at hearing that their little darlings aren't perfect. And congratulations, she'll probably never be honest with you again.\n\nI suggest getting over yourself, not saying the first rude thing that pops to mind when someone says something you don't like and doing what's best for your nephew (hint hint, that's being aware of the *reality* of how he's doing). \n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nHaving a \"non-traditional\" family situation can definitely negatively impact a child's mental health and cause them to act out. Your nephew may require additional support that you are denying him by getting unreasonably aggressive and defensive.", "YTA.\n\nThere is no reason to get so hostile at an innocent question. The teacher may be trying to accommodate your son, and help him. You didn\u2019t give her a chance to explain *how*, or *why*. You *immediately* shot her down and closed the conversation. \n\nDon\u2019t let your stubbornness/pride get in the way of your kids education. If you don\u2019t address the problems (which there obviously is, she called a meeting), they will only get worse. These behaviors should be nipped in the bud while he\u2019s young. You need to communicate with her. It\u2019s not about \u201cyour business\u201d. It\u2019s about *his*. \n\nYou come across as hostile and controlling, which is honestly scary. I personally acted out in school bc my home life was inconsistent and traumatizing. He might need therapy being away from his parents.", "YTA. Maybe your nephew has been saying things about his parents at school. Even if not, it's pretty normal for a teacher to ask if anything at home might be influencing troubling behaviour in school.\n\nYou jumped straight to \"you're a sorry excuse for a teacher and a human being,\" unbelievable that she was able to keep things civil.", "It's possible the teacher overheard the child talking about home and is nosy, but teachers are busy and I doubt they would go out of their way to create more drama when not warranted.   \n\nDo you have official/legal custody of this child?  Are you worried they could take him away?    If so, I get why you're defensive.   That said, get legal custody and it's not a problem.\n\n\nYTA for your behavior, not your desire to protect the child.", "As a teacher, if she\u2019s taking time out of her day to call you, it\u2019s not typical behavior (or beyond typical amounts of that behavior) and is an issue. We don\u2019t have time to make home contact that doesn\u2019t need to be made. Knowing about a child\u2019s home life/background is important for teachers to provide the best education and help possible. I guarantee she didn\u2019t call just to be nosy, and you were incredibly rude to someone who is trying to do her job and help the child.", "As a parent of 3, YTA. Here's why:\n\nTeachers need to know how they can help students. You are assuming he is acting like every other boy...maybe he's doing it more? You aren't there, you don't know. \n\nYou say he's okay...Kids tend to hide feelings. He may not be. Did he go to any form of counseling? That's recommended for children whose parents are not custodial.\n\nThe teacher already knows there's a situation because you are listed as a guardian. Your job as a guardian is to keep him safe, to provide for him, and to allow others help you help him. This includes teachers and school support staff.\n\nActing like this only makes it look to them like you have something to hide, and as mandatory reporters, they can and will call CPS about your behavior. \n\nScrew the gossip, that's your issue. You need to look out for him number one. That's means dealing with whatever talk goes on behind your back and work with the teacher. If he is acting out more than others, he needs counseling.", "\"Sorry, but I don't want to talk about it. It's family business only.\"  \n\n\nYTA for calling someone a sorry excuse for a human being just because they asked a couple of questions.", "YTA. This is one of the MANY reasons why no one wants to be a teacher anymore. Low pay and you have to deal with parents/guardians who act like entitled shit bags when a teacher is doing their job. Try dealing with 25+ young children 10 months out of the year, coming to care about all of them, and then when you are concerned because their behavior is different you get name called and talked down to. Yea maybe the other kids were acting the same way but I put money on the fact that the teacher asked the other parents/guardians similar questions.", "YTA. \nThere are different methods to use especially when the child is acting out from a trauma response. I wouldn't be surprised if there might be an assumption of abuse in the home with your reaction. You need to apologize otherwise if things keep happening in the future they might bypass you for safety reasons and go straight to cps etc.", "YTA. She\u2019s trying to help the child. I would assume the boy said something in class to make her think you weren\u2019t his father. Maybe his behavior is more like depression and she wants to know if something is going on at home. She\u2019s also a mandated reporter. If she thinks he\u2019s being abused or neglected, she is required to report it to the authorities. Maybe you should worry more about what the child needs.", "tbh it sounds like you're in total denial about the possibility that this adopted child - whose adopted parents are in jail for a long time, and who is being raised by his non-blood uncle - might be having a difficult time. YTA.", "YTA. You defensively jumped to a conclusion about 'why' the teacher was asking about the parents. Kids act out for a variety of reasons, which include their own emotional traumas. Some of these things don't manifest right away, and can show up years after the initial situation. The teacher works with children every day, year after year, so she is far more capable than you at judging whether something is 'typical' behavior or not. She needs to know if your nephew has some personal traumas that may need to be taken into consideration or require additional support. You didn't need to be rude, and sometimes an apology - even when you don't think you should give it - is an easy way to move ahead.", "YTA, this information is very relevant and important for the teacher to know.

His teachers always know this, because it helps them talk him through things when he's struggling!", "YTA\n\nThose are valid questions for a child acting up. Problems at home often result in problems at school. She was asking probably to see if he needs to see counseling, resources, or additional help. You overreacted.", "YTA you should be glad that the teacher cares for your nephew so much. So many teachers don\u2019t give a shit, just send him to the principals office and be done with them. But she\u2019s taking time to learn about the child. Behavioral issues in kids are often tied to emotional issues, she\u2019s making sure he\u2019s doing okay emotionally and probably wanted to work with you on helping him get through any emotional difficulties he may be experiencing. Which from what you describe he probably is having some emotional challenges. Missing your parents is really tough on a kid. \n\nApologize to the teacher.", "YTA\n\nSounds like she was respectful and just trying to gather the facts about a kid who is being disruptive/not experiencing the benefits of being in class. Beyond \u201cteaching,\u201d a teacher is a caregiver and needs all the information to take positive steps for the children in their daily care.

Family/home situations are actually one of the top reasons why students of all ages misbehave or have low performance at school.\n\nAt 8, the kid is old enough to know that you\u2019re not his parents and you\u2019re the one raising him \u2014 but at that age his brain is not able to comprehend why. This is why they act out in school. The teacher is concerned and trying to understand so she can be a safe person for him to go to at school, so she can provide help and information in better ways, so she can reach him in ways she can\u2019t right now.\n\nYou\u2019re a major AH by thinking she\u2019s just fishing for information. Why is it none of her business when she has him for 1/3 of the day 5/7 days a week?

The fact that he went through all these things in life and you still genuinely believe that it\u2019s impossible for him to be experiencing issues is honestly concerning. Your reactions to a simple question that every teacher asks when a student is disrupting the class and showing behavioral problems would cause concern for me if I was a teacher.

Sounds like this boy needs a whole new support system because you all seem to be failing him. Stop being defensive, and think about the well-being of the child that you claim to love and want to help take care of and less about your own feelings and emotions.

It's a complicated story. He's been with me since he was 5 and calls me Uncle Mike. \n\nHis teacher, Miss L, has been complaining about his behavior. I asked for examples and then asked her if other boys in her class displayed the same behavior because it sounds like typical 3rd grade boy behavior (ie not paying attention, talking too much).\n\nWe really weren't making any progress until she asked me about Aidan's home life. I thought she was going to ask about his sleeping habits. She said \"well meant about his parents.\"\n\nI asked her if this whole thing was an excuse to dig for personal information and if it was, then she's a sorry excuse for a teacher and a human being. \n\nShe was taken aback by my comment and said she didn't know if there was something she should know about. I told her if she has something to say, then say it. Do not waste my time by asking to meet me under false pretenses just so you can fish out why I'm raising my nephew. It's none of her business.\n\nShe said she'd try again when I was not so emotional and I said try again when you're not so nosy.\n\nToday she apologized for everything and said there was no excuse for \"knowing things\" that she didn't need to know. She said she wanted to start over. I think she expected me to apologize and I didn't. I told her I don't hold grudges and apology accepted.\n\nMy brother and his partner adopted Aidan at birth. Both of them are away for a very long time. I wasn't going to let Aidan go into foster care so I took him in. He's doing quite well.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a perfectly human response. \n\nI'd say reach out to a parent support group for parents with similar relationships with their kids and child services may just be a place if someone is needed to guide their unpacking of mom/dad as they get older (therapist, mentor, etc). Kids always notice what is different and can internalize it, not saying this is the case, but it does happen a lot with lingering questions about core life events. \n\nGood luck, you're a great person for taking this own for your son.\n\nAlso 3rd grades are wild. Self regulation is hard at that age. It could be something different like Miss L is boring and my friends are hilarious.  Kids are great.

You're clearly still very new to parenting, and you're projecting sexist and damaging ideas and assumptions onto him. Stop your \"boys will be boys\" attitude and work WITH his teacher to address what is not normal or OK behavior in a third grader (boy OR girl). This is part of parenting. I can think of dozens of possible things a parent can/should do in this case and it's not yell at his teacher and write off everything your kid does as \"boys will be boys\"--which is a 1 way ticket to raising a NIGHTMARE teenager and shitty adult.\n\nIf he's being disruptive and talkative in class, he's not learning and something is off. That doesn't bother you? You could be holding him back from an ADHD diagnosis that would change his life (in a positive way) or from working on positive social behaviors that will smooth his way for future school, work, and life accomplishments. Emotional regulation is literally your job as a parent to teach and you're not doing it--with him or yourself.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t really give a lot of details but from what you did mention, it sounds like she back tracked really quickly(out of a sense of self awareness) and your nephew is a normal kid with normal kid problems. \n\nTo the point of \u201ckids problems in school directly correlate with their problems at home\u201d agreed and if he\u2019s in a safe environment with emotional support he\u2019ll be expressing himself authentically so that he can get to the root of how his life, this far, affected him. Being respectful in class is one thing but making things into problems that aren\u2019t problems can really confuse a young humans perception.", "Good for you. Keep up the good work!", "Dude this guy is NTA because every teacher/nosy jerk in general thinks that if the parents aren't involved then everyone wants to call CPS and remove them from the uncle or the guardian that is actually caring for that child just because it doesn't fit their personal ideology. She's being nosy, it's not her business. That boy is just doing normal 3rd grader things that aren't even that bad and the teacher suddenly wants to know his whole gruesome backstory to see if it fits HER IDEOLOGY. Fuck her.", "YTA I hope you go back to the teacher and apologize, explain the situation so she can have a better understanding of how to help.

You know the videos of kids starting at a line together and they take a step forward if their parents graduated, are married, etc? That's the same thing. It's a way for the schools and teachers to learn information about students families that they do not need to know. (Our preschool even asked if my child was born via c section or not....it literally makes no difference) \nThe family dynamic does not matter so long as the kid is happy and healthy. \"Is your home chaotic?\" Would have more along the lines the teacher should have been askign about even while still being intrusive", "NTA - as long as you're this child's guardian, the circumstances by which that happened are none of her fucking business. Good for you for explaining that to her.", "NTA", "NTA.  The teacher had the wrong approach.  She should have delineated the nephew\u2019s misbehaviors by dates and in detail.  Instead of asking about the home life, she should have quoted anything disturbing or disruptive that the child had said.  Her intentions may have been innocent instead if just nosy, but her approach was wrong.  She needs to give a valid reason for asking before she asks.", "NTA, if this was an excuse and he is really not behaving like that, she is the AH, she can mind her own business.

The reason I say you are NTA is because you are in a precarious position and need to defend your child, but the teacher could and should have just come right out and asked what she needed to know and why. You were defensive but it wasnt because you just wanted to argue. With all due respect to everyone else, I am leery of teachers and how they are unnecessarily ignorant on some things while causing stress for others.   \n\n\nBy the way, I was a teacher once too, so everyone who wants to say I dont know what I am talking about....I actually do.", "NTA  It really isnt her business.

My kids have a very complicated situation regarding their bio dad and it\u2019s not something I like sharing with people. Based on your wording I suspect you and I have somewhat similar situations. \n\nI do share it with their teachers/school because it can very much be relevant to behaviors or emotions teachers see.

Most importantly, it gives my kids more trusted adults who can help them with the situation if needed.", "So perhaps you can just take a breath, a step back, and realize this isnt a personal dig on you or your parenting, its the teacher trying to help anyway she can. One thing that really helps my boys with school in incentives and constant reminders rountines. Still- we get the occasional teacher talk. What your saying about boys is true- but ypu can help but reading with them more at home, making it fun and doing it with them in small increments is what works best for us -also throwing in some fun crafts and such , right now were making a tiny town for christmas :)) no one thinks your not doing your best- its admirable that you took on your nephew in a tough time. Im getting off topic but my point is - the school will work with you anyway they can, and in turn you can make it easier for him also. God bless you for taking on this boy ! Your a saint, and should handle this situation with as much grace and good as you can!!", "YTA A kid that was adopted and then abandoned by his adoptive parents. Yeah I\u2019m sure he\u2019s doing great dude.

You took it upon yourself to ensure she never makes that mistake again.", "Yta.  As someone who interacts with your kid, it is helpful for her (and if it is helpful for her, then it is helpful for your kid) to know context... then she apologized and asked to start over and you basically gave her the finger.

All you can do is try to mitigate things but that means you have to be honest and ACCEPT HELP.\n\nLook I get the shame. Really I do, but you're gonna have to put YOUR feelings aside because it isn't about you. Its about Aidan.\n\nMy favorite uncle was locked up pretty much my entire childhood, which also meant the ENTIRETY of my youngest cousin and his daughter's childhood. All she had were calls and visit when her mother could swing it and make the not to quick journey to Desert Sands. That contact made things better than just years of silence but him being gone like that still had a negative impact on her regardless of everything our family did.\n\nYeah he's 8 now but he won't be forever and if he doesn't know the situation in a way that's currently appropriate for his age you are setting both of you up for one hell of a fight. Your reasons for keeping this from him(if you are) won't matter to him. He's gonna be a hurt kid who doesn't have his parents but does have an uncle who lied to him. For Years.\n\nI'm assuming he doesn't know because little kids have no filter so short of you drilling it into him to NOT talk about his parents and where they are(also a gotdamn problem) his teacher would have heard about that fact by now. \n\nSo yeah road to hell good intentions and all that. You owe Aidan the truth and an apology(and FFS please find a therapist for him because you're not equipped to help him deal with this) and that goes double for the teacher. Again this isn't about you. Its about Aidan and whats best for him.", "YTA, and Christ for a reaction like that damn straight I\u2019d be concerned. Kiddo is having issues at school, which as most people know, can be an indicator of a greater issue.", "YTA\n\nThis is absolutely her business. If she sees issues in the classroom, there might be something going on, and thank god teachers notice these things and ask questions. \n\nHe probably did experience trauma as an infant, even if he doesn't remember it. It can still cause issues as a child and adult.", "YTA, she acted how a teacher should act and from reading how you went into this situation you were pretty much hoping for someone to ask about your nephew's home life so you could \"dunk\" on someone.", "YTA for being unreasonably defensive", "YTA\nNo it\u2019s none of her business. But if want to help your nephew what is the harm in telling her?? I can\u2019t see how you telling her some info will be used against you or your nephew. \n\nIf someone is expressing help. Take it. \n\nBoys overacting in class is not normal. She must have seen a behaviour different than other children therefore her knowing the family dynamic can help her guide you and nephew to resources or tips to succeed.", "YTA She said that his behaviour is problematic. As someone who teaches 3rd grade kids for a living, I think she'll probably best placed to say whether or not it's typical behaviour. I seriously doubt she's all that interested in any kids homelife for prurient reasons. If you're asking for specific examples, you're not getting the problem - constant low-level bad behaviour may well be symptomatic of trauma. Your nephew has been through a lot, let people help him. Over-defensive parents or guardians can just stand in the way of kids improving", "YTA, she was asking to try to help and understand his behavior. Teachers aren\u2019t being nosy, it\u2019s out of concern and looking for the best approach to help. She backed down because she saw you weren\u2019t happy and knew that any more inquiring was going to cause issues for the child at home. She is aware that he\u2019s struggling like from his parents being in jail (assuming but likely given your hesitation in opening up here and there).

A teacher could also get CPS involved if the behaviour is really bad.\n\nTalk to the teacher at least apologise for just being defensive and overly protective. Have your guard up yes but not too up that stops you from seeing help when it's being offered.", "I want to say NAH because it seems clear you're working hard to make a good life for this kid, but you also seem to be having an unproductive reaction to the teacher. You sound defensive and like you're rejecting her concerns -- is it possible you're either feeling burnt out by all the work of raising a child and her concern sounds like judgment of your parenting?\n\nIt seems deeply unlikely that the teacher is prying due to inherent nosiness. Teaching is hard work and not paid particularly well; most teachers I know do it because they care about the children. She is probably just trying to help and I encourage you to hear her out for the sake of the child.\n\nI also encourage you to make sure you're doing what you need to take care of yourself as well. Parenting isn't easy!", "YTA. she likely was looking for anything that could impact your nephews behavior ie. A recent move, divorce, death, etc. Maybe he's being bringing up his parents in class and mentioned you're his uncle. So the teacher may be wondering if this is a recent thing or if something has come up to change his situation. \n\nGuardians/parents and teachers have to work together. I highly doubt she cares that you're raising your nephew. She just wants to be aware of anything she may need to  compensate for in the classroom.", "YTA\n\nI worked with teachers and this is a normal question. It's part of their training. If the child is acting out then she needs to understand if the is the child's normal personality or just school behavior to accommodate and accomplish her education goals. \n\nLashing out a someone who is just trying to do their job is a dick move.", "YTA. You could've said that you'd rather not talk about the reasons you're raising him. Maybe reassure her that there isn't anything she needs to know, like about abuse from his parents that she needs to report. That is her job. It's normal for teachers to have to call dcfs. Your first reaction was very intense. I would seek anger management somehow.", "Sorry but YTA.  And you arguing with everyone doesn\u2019t help your case. \n\nIf the teacher has noticed disruptive behavior with any of her students, she\u2019s obligated to reach out to their parents/guardian.

You don\u2019t seem receptive to the answer.", "Absolutely yes, YTA. The teacher asked a universal baseline question and you jumped on her assuming you knew her perspective.

So it was important that my teachers knew that about my home life so they could help me when I had a bad day. Your son may be showing signs of not being as emotionally ok as you think he is during school and the teacher needs to know how to approach that. But you just closed the door on that teacher going the extra mile this year.", "You had no problem telling us, a bunch of strangers online, what the situation with Aidan's parents was.  Why would it be so difficult to explain to the teacher.\nFurthermore you are entrusting this person in the care and well-being of Aiden during school hours.

I hate to break it to you, but your life is not so interesting that a teacher wants to know every detail.  She wants to know if something at home is being picked up on by the other kids and used to wind him up. Or affecting his mental health, sleep pattern etc. Right now I'd say her conclusion is \"acting parent volatile and aggressive\". Real parents care about their kid's mental health and education,  and if your son is being disruptive,  he's preventing other kids from getting their teacher's full attention, and that's out of order. Dial down your attitude, apologise to the poor woman and work with her to help him get the best out of his school life.", "YTA.

They may have ADHD or autism. I wonderful smart kids with both of those conditions.

The kid is having issues and his parents aren't around, that's a thing the teacher SHOULD know.", "A soft YTA. I can fully understand why you're overprotective towards your kid, but her question sounded pretty standard to me. When children are having behavioral issues, it's normal for teachers or other staff to inquire about their home life. I get that the kid has probably been through a lot and you're doing your best, but please understand that the teacher was likely just doing her job and not trying to pick apart your personal life. She just wants to understand him better so she can adjust how she interacts with him; so hopefully, in turn, he can start to do better.", "Dude the way you reacted probably set off some alarm bells.

My son (5m) has never met his bio dad and his bio dad wants nothing to do with him. I have shared this with his teachers so they can let me know if he is having any behavioral issues at school. I have also consented to him talking with a Child and Youth Worker multiple times a month at the school. I have also informed them that I am expecting a baby in April, and to please let me know if they notice behavioral changes in my son. Being open and honest with school teachers not only helps the teachers but the child as well.

Goodluck!", "Soft Yta. I understand trying to protect your nephew, and his personal information. However, if there is a trauma involved, it could help the teacher to be aware. My daughters (five years old) teacher is aware about my daughters ptsd, and the traumas surrounding it.

Only it's something really, really important for teachers to know about a kid who's experiencing sudden behaviour changes. The teacher works with 3rd grade boys for a living--she knows what's \"normal 3rd grade boy\" behaviour and what isn't. Your nephew isn't displaying \"normal\" behaviour, and he may not be displaying behaviour that's typical for him. When kids are suddenly displaying changes, the first thing anyone in a social services (education, health, welfare, etc) position is going to ask is, 'what's going on at home?' because there are big links between home life & outside-of-home behaviour. And if the answer is 'nothing, everything at home is normal,' great! They move on to doing things like psychoeducational testing if they suspect it could be something like ADHD.

I could not care less about my students\u2019 parents\u2019 personal lives but it makes my job infinitely harder when a student is going through major issues and I don\u2019t know/can\u2019t help them work through their emotions or can\u2019t anticipate some extra challenges. \nI\u2019m going to gently say YTA-in the future I\u2019d recommend explaining that you\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal details but that custody has changed which might cause some extra tension/behaviors for a while.

If I know the person bringing them in isn\u2019t mom or dad, I ask about the parent situation to see if that may be playing a factor into behavior (because I can guarantee you 9 times out of 10, it\u2019s related to that).

Trust me, teachers are tired and not running around trying to dig up dirt on their students' private lives for entertainment. \n\nOften there is one kid who really stands out in disrupting a class & it is a teacher's job to suss out if there is stress in the home or possible learning disabilities. 8 or 9 is when kids do get diagnosed. In Aidan's case, he may have some trauma from being an adoptee then losing the only parents he knew and now being under your care\u2013\u2013 no matter how great you are with him. That's a pivotal age and loss of primary caretakers can lead to trauma and attachment issues that show up as acting out for attention. \n\nStop being defensive. Go apologize to her.

Not paying attention and/or talking too much can be signs his needs are not being met at home and therefore his learning is being impacted. So much so that this teacher is reaching out to you. \n\nYou can keep the explanation simple: I'm taking care of my nephew now and for the foreseeable future. Most teachers will take that into consideration and make adjustments as needed. We see and meet with families that are just like yours on a regular basis. As long as the child as someone outside of school who cares about them and for them, we don't care who it is or how they're related (if at all). \n\nWork WITH the teacher to help your nephew, not against her.

Teacher showed concern. You were rude.  Teacher was the bigger person and apologized, and you wouldn't even reciprocate.", "Wow YTA. She was being concerned for him, not being nosy.

I think you are a little bit TA for responding harshly, because you could\u2019ve gotten your point across in a tactful way,  but I do applaud you for telling her to mind her own business! \n\nShe was absolutely being nosy. I don\u2019t believe for one second she would\u2019ve changed the way she educates him based on his history. I also think that the teacher needs to provide each and every child with the same amount of compassion, regardless of their background. They shouldn\u2019t need know their sob stories in order to handle be kind and patient. When I was enrolling one of my children in school, the form asked if they were born vaginally or by C-section. I went to the desk and asked why that question was on the form. She looked a little confused, but said some children learn differently, based on how they were born. I asked for an example on how they would educate my vaginally born versus C-section born children, and she could not provide an answer. It was removed from the form!", "YTA\n\nThat information IS her business. She is his teacher. Knowing home life situations helps teachers adjust teaching strategies.\n\nFor example: back when I was student teaching (11th graders), I had a student in my 1st hour who slept through half of my classes. Normal protocol was to wake the student up and keep them focused, but I found out from my mentor teacher that this student had a 1-year-old at home and the baby was going through sleep regression. Knowing that, I decided to let the student sleep when they were tired and told them they could come back during study period if they needed me to go over anything they missed while sleeping. (they were a very bright student and got As in my class so it was never a problem, they were just tired!)\n\nKnowing that Aidan's dads are away from home and he's staying with his uncle for the time being is enough. She doesn't need to know all the details of everything that happened, but knowing that Aidan might be struggling with those things will help her with teaching him. \n\nAlso, if you're worried about this info becoming 'everyone's business', look into FERPA. Information about Aidan's home life would be protected by FERPA, so only 'individuals that need to know for educational purposes' would be told. The teacher, the principal, the school counselor, and any special services Aidan gets (speech therapy, physical therapy, etc.). If anyone else were to find out, you could sue the school and people would be fired over it. So if you want to say \"I will tell you this but please respect FERPA\" then that will make it clear to the teacher that you have an expectation of privacy about all of this.\n\nEDIT: as for why I could give the example above: enough information was removed that you would not be able to identify the former student in question, which is the crux of FERPA. Now if I had said \"this student in my second grade class at X elementary school in Y state from 2022-2023\", that would violate FERPA because it narrows things down enough that you can research the 25 kids in my class and figure out which one I'm talking about.", "YTA.\n\nThe teacher wishing to understand his home situation was totally reasonable and understandable.\n\nYou quite obviously have no understanding at all of child development and even less understanding of how to manage basic situations appropriately.\n\nIf thus is your approach to the teacher, then I hope she's raised a record of concern regarding your conduct, as you've made what shouldn't be a shameful situation for the child into some dirty secret with you presenting yourself as some sort  hillbilly lock keeper chav!", "This is a typical approach??

Definitely YTA.", "Yes, like any major changes will cause a kid to act out. Seen it a thousand times. New baby, paretns getting locked up, change house, fighting parents etc.", "This. I have had 1,000s of children as students. You have the one. One of us might know a bit more about what is \"normal\"...", "Completely agree. Also not paying attention/ talking might be typical for all students every now and then but if he\u2019s doing it for most of the lesson, every lesson that\u2019s a huge problem and not typical at all. \n\nOP, you should be working with the teacher to help the child, not getting angry and dismissing valid feedback. YTA", "Belligerence is the perfect word to use here. It's just nonsensical anger and defensiveness", "TBH, he definitely gave her some information about the kid's home life. He's clearly being raised by an aggressive, short tempered asshole which could easily mean there's abuse from OP.\n\nBy the way OP, YTA.", "She wanted some insight and, unfortunately, I think she got it.  I can see that OP probably thinks he is defending this child and his family, however, in reality he may be adding to the problem. It\u2019s possible this kid needs help which OP can find through this teacher if he opens up a bit.", "Exactly. OP immediately went on the defensive. The teacher wasn't even digging. It's pretty common for a kid's homelife to impact their behaviour at school, and the teacher didn't even ask any probing questions. She even tried to he the bigger person and attempted to make amends", "This is exactly what I thought.  The poor kid first gets adopted and then his adopted parents end up in jail and he ends up living with a non blood relative! The teacher obviously is very insightful and caring of their students to know to ask the right questions! OP needs to help the teacher so that they can help the kids together.", "It\u2019s not a giant leap, \u201caway\u201d is a commonly used euphemism for away in prison.", "This right here. Like it or not, teachers are going to connect to your children at a personal level. They literally spend half their waking hours with them for like 180 days.\n\nLet me talk about an extreme example. Partner used to work with smuggled kids. Usually cartel victims who were being used as mules but escaped and went into ICE custody. Obviously, she didn't even have parents for these kids for her to talk to and the legality around direct questions is really iffy so she can't go trying to ask an underage person what horrible or shitty things they've gone through.\n\nThey *can* volunteer information when talking to their teacher about why they're struggling. There was one kid who was particularly problematic. Obvious signs of PTSD. The adults at the orphanage where he was staying were afraid of him. None of the teachers assigned there could speak Spanish except for my partner.\n\nShe decided to take a bit of a gamble and sit with the kid with just a single monitor in the room who would help if this kid got violent. She asked him what's going on with him and said it's OK if he couldn't speak about it but that she wanted to be there for him.\n\nHe broke down sobbing about a cartel he was basically enslaved with. Took him and his girlfriend from their homes when they were like 14. Beheaded her in front of him at 15. Committed tons of heinous acts of SA on him and forced him to carry drugs for them. Kept forcing him to watch as they brutally murdered people. He eventually ran for it when they were near the border and he was detained and brought to the shelter cause he was still a minor and couldn't be immediately turned away.\n\nThis kid got access to psychological care to treat his PTSD and medication to help regulate his emotional state and all kinds of things. He is just one scared young boy and happened to have a voice of someone who actually made the effort to listen.\n\nObviously this is the most horrific and extreme sort of situation. That kid had nobody to help be his advocate until *finally* someone who could understand and wanted to understand him came into his life.\n\nLiterally any teacher worth their salt wants the same for their kids. They want to make sure everything is tuned to the best possible state of things to help ensure the success of their students. In spite of all the testing and mandated bullshit of the local and state governments they want to keep working for their kids above all else.\n\nIf a teacher's asking you about personal life stuff for Aiden, it's to do the best she can to help him be the best he can. Your hostility is screwing that up big time. They want to be a voice and advocate for the kid. So open up and communicate and get into the same corner as teacher here cause y'all are rooting for the same kid. Otherwise you're definitely the AH.", "As an ex educator, this is the exact answer based off the retelling of that interaction. \n\nDude needs to chill out and look inward for why he\u2019s so defensive. YTA.", "Also, telling her about his behavior in class is not \"complaining.\" Every elementary school report card includes behavioral notes so you know what to work on with your child at home. If he's being disruptive in class, it's literally the teacher's job to relay that to his guardian.", "this is exactly the correct answer. I am a teacher, and all of this information is pertinent to planning interventions. it sounds like Aidan could have experienced some trauma in his short life and could be acting out as a result. it's not a bad thing, but it's a bad thing that OP reacted in this way. \n\nYTA.", "And cudos to her for apologising when she didn't need to.", "Completely agree. My cousin is a teacher and holy cow. She puts so much effort into making her students comfortable and to help them with anything they need, and no matter her sweetest efforts, the parents will find issue with anything.\n\nThis teacher is being extremely graceful in her responses to OP\u2019s behavior. I get that OP is defensive of his nephew\u2019s situation, but unless she was overly aggressive first, there just isn\u2019t a reasonable or fair excuse on his end. \n\nOP, you do need to apologize. If you\u2019re to set a good example for your nephew, then treating someone who is looking out for his well being like they\u2019re an enemy is not the way. Yes, little boys are rambunctious. I have a boy toddler that I\u2019m sure will be disruptive and have trouble listening in class some day. And I *want* his teachers to let me know when he\u2019s acting up, especially if it\u2019s more than usual. It might be normal kid behavior, but it might be him acting out because of something else. As the parent/caretaker of kids, we need to know how our kids are feeling. And we need to help incorporate good habits so that they can listen better and learn better in class. If she\u2019s bringing a point of concern to you, it\u2019s because she cares enough to help him through it. And if she needs to change something in the way she teaches or how she interacts with him at times based on something she doesn\u2019t know about but you do, then be open to helping her help him. It\u2019s what she\u2019s there for.", "Absolutely! Any kind of deviation, won\u2019t even say disturbance cuz good things too are deviations, can cause kids to act out with bad behaviors.

I didn\u2019t want Dad\u2019s \u201cdirt\u201d but that made perfect sense given how she was acting.", "Exactly this. I can even understand OP\u2019s discomfort, but even in his telling, this reads like someone who brought an immense amount of defensiveness and suspicion into an otherwise simple interaction. The way it just went 0-60\u2026", "This, the teacher is trying to figure out if something related to his home life is making him disruptive in class. Him being adopted and then his adopted parents going away when he was 5, so now having to live with his Uncle. It wouldn't be crazy to think this could negatively impact the child.\n\nWould OP rather the teacher just puts him down to being a troublesome child?", "This. Being defensive with not help!", "As a person leaving eduction THANK YOU!\nYta op", "Exactly.  Retired elementary teacher.  Dad, you have no idea of what all your kid has said at school, whether to other kids or to teachers.  Teachers need to know the back story so their response is appropriate and their guidance is most effective.  As teachers, we know when parents are drug addicts, in prison/jail, two dads, two moms, mom and grandma, dad and grandma, grandma and grandpa, auntie, etc etc.  \n\nKnowing helps us help your child.", "If he needs help, she should've led with that. Instead, she wants to know all the gory details of the kids life.

It is NOT anyone else\u2019s business who is raising the kiddo as long as the kid is being raised and treated well. If your boss started asking you about your personal life and why you do things off the clock are you voluntarily answering those questions? Are you telling your boss everything that goes on in your life outside of work? I doubt it so if an adult doesn\u2019t tell their boss why should a teacher know that either.", "I agree that she may be just trying to help, but something that can\u2019t be overlooked is that teachers are mandatory reporters, meaning if they hear something concerning about the child\u2019s home life they are required to report to social services. \n\nI think he went about the conversation in the wrong way, but isn\u2019t the AH for being reserved.", "No, she was fishing. Like a concern troll, she has decided that Aiden's guardianship situation must be the cause of all issues. \n\nOP did describe sleeping habits and rightly pointed out that these are very normal kid behaviours.

NTA.", "Do you have a link to the original?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "No kidding", "Right? Kid is just emulating the uncle's attitude.", "You worded it perfectly. I don\u2019t think the teacher had any other interest in knowing more about Aidan's life besides trying to understand where his behaviour is coming from and how she can direct him in class to help overcome his difficulties. \n\nI can understand OP's defensiveness in just trying to protect the child, but I believe things could\u2019ve been handled way better.", "Came to say this.", "This is the exact reply OP needs to read. \n\nHis nephew\u2019s parents being \u201caway for a long time\u201d can be impacting his social and behavioural development. Teacher\u2019s look out for these things and aren\u2019t being nosy when asking. \u201cBeing away for a long time\u201d sounds kind of like prison, unless both are military with extended overseas postings at the same time.

OP, my ex is transgender and I made sure to disclose that to our daughter's teacher so they have an understanding of what's going on.\n\nIt helps the teacher.  Kids can be mean, my daughter was 6 when she was asked a couple of times about \"having two moms\".  It's tough and kids don't always have the tools to navigate those types of situations. If the teacher knows and notices bullying like that, they can discuss how families come in different forms.", ">There is no reason to get so hostile at an innocent question.\n\nTo be fair, everything he DID say here would quantify a good reason the boy would need extra support. \n\nEven if th child understands, emotions are hard for kids, and without preparation you can spoil a kid for the worst by simply doing nothing.

I thanked the teacher and told her I\u2019d talk to my daughter that night. The teacher seemed so relieved by my response and noted that a lot of parents get so defensive.

It\u2019s a difficult and sensitive subject, but indeed this teacher was doing a good thing by taking interest in their student and trying to understand the context for the behavior in order to both develop more empathy for the situation and build strategies that will help.", "Where did she ask for \"gory details\"? When a child is having issues, it helps to know if there have been major life upsets (there has), circumstances that would affect his behavior (there are), situations that might cause distraction, emotional outbursts, etc (he's experienced all of that). Just because op summed it up as \"boys will be boys\", doesn't mean that's the case. You're in the wrong. Unless op is trained to recognize these things, they may not. Teachers don't go around prying just to be the neighborhood gossips. This behavior right here is one of the reasons it's impossible to keep good, invested, caring teachers on the job.", "She didn't ask why OP was raising the child. She was asking about the bio parents.\n\nA lot of kids in the foster system are still being forced to see their bio parents. For a lot of this, this is the most traumatic part of their week. \n\nI don't want to blame the teacher for trying to see if the kid is misbehaving because he is a spoiled brat, or a traumatized kid that doesn't know how to handle trauma.\n\nSo respectfully, yes, the teacher is one of the person raising the kids, she deserves to have all the information that can help her help the kids.", "A boss doesn't help raise you for 8hrs a day, a teacher literally helps raise your children.", "As a teacher\u2026it\u2019s super helpful to know if there has been a divorce/separation, or a loss in the family, or any number of other issues. Not because I\u2019m nosy, but because traumatic events can cause kids to behave a certain way. Not every kid with behavioural issues is dealing with trauma, but some are. When I have asked and parents don\u2019t want to tell me what\u2019s going on, I respect that fully. But most at least say \u201cyeah, our family is going through some changes, and he\u2019s struggling a bit\u201d or something.  If a kid is feeling especially vulnerable, it\u2019s good to know that.", ">I asked her if this whole thing was an excuse to dig for personal information and if it was, then she's a sorry excuse for a teacher and a human being\n\nIf it was just OP being reserved, I wouldn't have said he was an asshole. If he felt like sharing personal info with the teacher wouldn't help, he could have said so in a respectful way. He chose to be rude and uncooperative instead. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, the person that is going to suffer the most from this interaction is the child. How sad.", ">she has decided that Aiden's guardianship situation must be the cause of all issues.\n\nIt could be ? Op didn't mentionned if the bio parents are still in the picture. Having abusive parent still in their life could impact how a kid behave, and the way you handle a traumatized kid and an entitled kid is NOT the same.\n\nAlso, please stop with the \"boys will be boys\" attitude. The teacher said he was misbehaving in class. The fact that other boys do it too doesn't make it any more acceptable.", "Not kind of, prison is exactly what it means.", "Thank you! I mean is it so hard to treat a teacher like a human being and not a robot who drones on? If you don\u2019t want to discuss it, then fine, just be polite about it. Nowadays teaching, especially in the US, is an exhausting, DANGEROUS, and thankless job. I wanted to be one, but I know I couldn\u2019t handle it because of the parents who think they are the only people in this world who care about kids.", "\"Both of them are away for a very long time\" from the OP is a euphemism for them being in jail.", "I feel like OP took it as a personal attack, as if she was criticizing his parenting when she wasn\u2019t at all. And another thing is how he said \n>it sounds like typical 3rd grade boy behavior\n\nit can\u2019t be THAT typical if she\u2019s questioning his home life", "As a teacher you don't get to pry into business just because you want to know. As far as the school knows, OP is the child's guardian. That is all they need to know to do their job. If the teacher had a legitimate concern, they could have included the school counselor or had specific instances of behavior problems. They didn't and then she apologized, accepting his perspective of the teacher's behavior.", "I mean it\u2019s been a while but when I was in elementary school I clearly remember when certain kids would act up in the middle of a lesson (it was the same kids most of the time) the teacher would go to her desk & scribble a note down after dealing with them then they\u2019d continue their teaching. I\u2019d seen a few of the notes on their desk on occasion later in the day & they did indeed have the kids name on it & some info about the situation. \n\nSo yeah, taking 5 seconds to notate the date & quick description of what happened isn\u2019t that difficult, especially if it\u2019s repeated behavior & worthy of a phone call or meeting with the parent/guardian. I mean what\u2019s the point of even contacting the parent or guardian if you don\u2019t have any information to actually explain to them what\u2019s going on with their kid?", "I read it as she knows the uncle is primary caregiver and he answered how he is doing. Then she wanted to pry why parents aren't around. That's none of her business if he chooses not to share.", "Its literally one the the ACE's aswell which could affect the child later on down the line never mind just now.", "Yup, and kid was also adopted, so could have issues from that, or maybe something from pregnancy that is unknown.\n\nI am a pediatric OT. I also have to ask similar kinds of questions, and often in the intake interview!\n\nOP sounds like the teacher is trying to help you and Aidan. Let them!!!", "That is what it means where I am too. An adopted child who has both adopted parents in jail needs some special care both in and out of school.", "According to OP but not according to his teacher", "OP shut the teacher down before she could give any sort of input.", ">I'm not sure if teacher necessarily cared whether OP was the uncle vs. dad or whatever, but more like if he's getting enough sleep, any obvious stressors, anything that kids might typically face at home that might make them act out.\n\nOP says he thought the same thing and talked about sleeping habits but the teacher said she meant about the parents. I don't know about her motivation and I haven't decided what I think about OP's reaction, but at least this part is not accurate.", "She asked about his home life but then she said she meant about his parents. OP was prepared to answer questions about sleep. OP didn\u2019t want to talk about the kid\u2019s parents and that\u2019s part of what she wanted to know.", "The kid is probably using the fact that two sets of parents have abandoned him as an excuse for bad behavior. And honestly, it\u2019s not a bad excuse, but the teacher has to know what is true and what isn\u2019t.", "YTA. I think you jumped to that conclusion quickly and I think most teachers when behavior is questioned ask about the home life", "This!  I had a child a few years ago that would have crying tantrums every Tuesday.  He was a sweet kid, but those episodes were disruptive and scary for the other children.  I finally called the mom because this didn't seem like normal separation anxiety.  Turns out a judge had ordered that now that the child was 3 the father could have overnight visitations Sunday through Tuesday. So, the poor little guy had had just been returned to mom and was now having to leave her again for school.  Knowing what kids are going through at home is really helpful when dealing with behavior issues.", "Except she was describing behaviors that are typical of kids that age. Unless she arranged a meeting with the parents of every child in class who talked too much and didn\u2019t always pay attention, she was wrong.", "Randos on Reddit aren\u2019t going to have an effect on the kid\u2019s life. We don\u2019t know who he is.", "This!! If he has core memories with his adoptive parents and now he\u2019s with uncle then that could be why he is acting out. I think op is the AH for how he spoke to the teacher, seems like he\u2019s projecting insecurities? Maybe if they find out more he might be scared that the child will be removed?", "This is exactly how I feel. It is important for teachers to understand home life sometimes. Perhaps she was downplaying the behaviors and just attempting to understand.", "Yeah, being abandoned by two sets of parents would be tough for any kid to deal with.", "Are you a teacher or do you just make shit up to defend someone who's being a gigantic asshole and probably covering up abuse? This is a completely normal thing for a teacher to ask and she only apologized because he started screaming.", "> OP says he thought the same thing and talked about sleeping habits but the teacher said she meant about the parents.\n\nWell yeah, if a kid is, eg, grieving the death of both of his parents, that would require a different approach than if a kid was, eg, removed from his parents' custody because of abuse or neglect. \n\nKnowing the kid's situation is absolutely relevant to his experience in the classroom.", "If the child is being raised by someone other than his parents, it could be a source of stress for him and that is something his teacher could find useful. For whatever reason, his *adoptive* parents are out of the picture, he is being raised now by (at least) a third party and he\u2019s only 8. That kind of instability is a big deal.", "Teacher obviously knows that OP isn't dad. The reasons that mom and dad aren't around could be the cause of any sleep issues or obvious stressor. Mom and dad were gone at 5 years old. Has OP done any work or therapy with his nephew to help him understand and deal with the fact the his parents are 'away'?.", "Agree but we don't know WHY she asked about the parents. Maybe they are going through a nasty divorce, died or went to jail. All things that can effect how a kid feels emotionally.\n\nI think OPs defensiveness is super telling that there is a situation going on that he feels uncomfortable about. Imagine how the kid feels.", "The fact that a child\u2019s parents could be \u201caway for a very long time\u201d could very well be a stressor. OP was a dick for no good reason.\n\nYta OP.", "Thank you. This part was very clear, he even quoted the teacher.", "It's pretty easy to surmise that the child has said things about his parents or otherwise indicated he is having troubles adjusting to their not being there. Again, teachers aren't interested in being nosey for the sake of it. They're there to help their students adjust and learn in the most productive way possible sand knowing their home circumstances is vital to that. OP got unnecessarily defensive because he ASSUMED it was fishing for gossip. In reality, she's trying to help this child, and it's quite likely that he's not as well adjusted to the situation with his parents as OP wants to believe. He's feeling defensive and it shows.", "That's part of what she NEEDS to know. There's a reason she's asking. Clearly Aidan is not as well adjusted to their absence as OP wants to pretend and it's affecting him. She's trying to HELP this child. She isn't interested in gossiping about him, she's trying to understand him. It's pretty obvious when a child's behavior is the result of something more stressing than poor sleep habits.", "If he wants to help the kid he needs to give proper information to the person dealing with him for 7 hours a day. \n\n*of course* the kid without parents could be affected by the absence of his parents. It's reasonable to ask and she wouldn't be doing her job if she didn't.", "But a lot of things that adults don\u2019t want to talk about are major stressors for kids. Another board I read- the little kid watched his whole family be murdered in front of home, was shunted across the country to live with his extended family, and was having issues in school. NO ONE had informed the classroom teachers that were interacting with this child that this huge traumatic event had occurred a month earlier. \n\nAnd also, \u201cnormal kid behavior\u201d is a phrase used to minimize problematic behavior every day. \n\nMaybe the teacher was overstepping, but for adults who are with these children for half their waking hours for 60% of the year, they need to know crucial things about their students.", "Stolen comment!! Original is second comment and was posted 1h or more ago.", "Clearly they weren\u2019t typical for OP\u2019s nephew or at least they were happening more frequently.", "Not all kids in the class have \"guardian\" instead of parents, and parents that are gone away for a \"very long time\". And I am sure she has talked to other parents that have children rhat are showing concerning behaviors. OP is not doing this child any favors by shutting out the teacher.", "We also don't know more than his parents were put away for a long time. This person is exaggerating to fit their narrative.", "Especially if it was a recent change.  If the move had happened over the summer, for instance, it could  still be reverberating in his behavior. It also could if it the move was a while ago, but knowing something about the timing would help the teacher know if this is a long-term issue or temporary.", "She already knows that he child is being raised by someone other than his parents. Thus she knows that this could be a source of stress for him. Why does she need to know more than that? \n\nAlso, he's not doing anything that I would think of as concerning behavior. Lots of kids talk a lot and don't pay attention in class even when they have a stable homelife. It seems she's pushing for way more info than is necessary to have for the situation at hand.", "EXACTLY! Has OP provided any PROFESSIONAL mental or emotional support to help nephew to deal with the circumstances around WHY his parents are 'away'? The fact the foster care was the only other alternative OP mentions is very telling.", "THIS. Op is the responsible adult and he is clearly not okay, I can only imagine how the kid is doing", "Yup, having an incarcerated family member, let alone two, is an adverse childhood event, which increases his risk for risk taking behaviors, poor mental health, difficulty transitioning to adulthood, and poorer health overall.", "I was the child without parents. Started the new school at 7 when my uncle and aunt took me in. They filled the teachers in on how I ended up with them. I had some major trauma issues and it helped me a lot", "OP has been raising his nephew since nephew was 5yo."]}
