It's a complicated story. He's been with me since he was 5 and calls me Uncle Mike. \n\nHis teacher, Miss L, has been complaining about his behavior. I asked for examples and then asked her if other boys in her class displayed the same behavior because it sounds like typical 3rd grade boy behavior (ie not paying attention, talking too much).\n\nWe really weren't making any progress until she asked me about Aidan's home life. I thought she was going to ask about his sleeping habits. She said \"well meant about his parents.\"\n\nI asked her if this whole thing was an excuse to dig for personal information and if it was, then she's a sorry excuse for a teacher and a human being. \n\nShe was taken aback by my comment and said she didn't know if there was something she should know about. I told her if she has something to say, then say it. Do not waste my time by asking to meet me under false pretenses just so you can fish out why I'm raising my nephew. It's none of her business.\n\nShe said she'd try again when I was not so emotional and I said try again when you're not so nosy.\n\nToday she apologized for everything and said there was no excuse for \"knowing things\" that she didn't need to know. She said she wanted to start over. I think she expected me to apologize and I didn't. I told her I don't hold grudges and apology accepted.\n\nMy brother and his partner adopted Aidan at birth. Both of them are away for a very long time. I wasn't going to let Aidan go into foster care so I took him in.

Definitely YTA.", "YTA\n\nIn majority of cases with children and school, there's a direct correlation between how they behave in school and their home life. The teacher is trying to understand the child.\n\nThis post also lacks a great deal of context such as details of the conversation and the actual behavior of the child. Without anything else, it sounds like you got defensive for no reason.", "YTA. I think you jumped to that conclusion quickly and I think most teachers when behavior is questioned ask about the home life", "YTA\n\nDude, if the kid is acting out in class and the teacher thinks it\u2019s connected to his home life and his parents, then letting the teacher know what\u2019s going on will help the teacher know how how to accommodate Aidan.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re doing family trees or class work involving parents, and that makes Aidan act out more.  So that\u2019s why the teacher made the connection.\n\nRefusing to tell the teacher anything is just hurting Aidan.", " She\u2019s a teacher, you don\u2019t think she knows what typical boy behavior is? She sees he is struggling and she is asking if something is going on so she could provide further assistance.  You\u2019re being mean  for no reason", "Damn. The teacher was looking for insight so she could work with him more effectively and you chose to respond with belligerence. YTA.", "I mean I feel like a lot of this comes down to things like tone and subtext, but leaning towards YTA.\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable for a teacher to ask about home life to understand their students better. Honestly I think this is fine even if there's no problems. It would help her be more sensitive to Aidan's particular circumstances, particularly if things like home and family come up in class.\n\nThey can ask, you don't have to answer. You can just say it's private and you would prefer not to discuss it. Getting hostile and accusing her like that sounds like you got very aggressive for no reason. \n\nI'm guessing (?) you've had bad experiences with gossip before, so maybe that's why it felt like such a sensitive issue, and if so I'm sorry about that. But nothing you've said here gives the impression she was asking anything other than normal questions to help her do her job.", "YTA. You say his parents are \"away for a very long time\". I'm making a giant leap here and thinking you mean prison. If so, it might be helpful for her to know, because with all the things in the news, other kids may be talking about \"bad people in jail\", etc. Also, your nephew may be very well adjusted, for which I applaud you, but it is more likely he has some feelings about his parents being away and needs someone to talk to when other kids are talking about their families & parents and keeping the teacher \"in the loop\" can help her let you know when she notices things that are negatively affecting him. If she asked to speak with you she is likely noticing \"things\", but they may be subtle signs that are hard to pinpoint and articulate. \n\nYou seem to be treating her as the enemy, when she is just trying to be an ally and do what is best for your nephew.", "YTA. Sounds like you have a huge chip on your shoulder about your situation, and maybe you should do some self-reflection to figure out why. The teacher asked a VERY valid question, one that if she knew the answer to it could help her better understand your nephew and how better to help him. You owe her a huge apology. YTA.", "YTA. The teacher is trying to help your child. Knowing his background can be very helpful and enlightening.\n\nShe is not trying to \"fish\" information. She is trying to understand why your child his acting the way he acts so she can plan her interventions betters and make sure she doesn't make thing worst by making bad interventions with him\n\nStop fighting her : she is not your enemy, she is your ally.\n\nEdit: so tired of people saying that the teacher is being nosy. The teacher was trying to get more info in order to do better interventions with the kids. If a kid is having a bad behaviour because he is rotten spoiled and his parents are assholes, her interventions will be more stern and punitive. If the kids misbehaved on a monday, and the teacher knows very well that the kid just spent a traumatic weekend with her abusive parents, then she will use patience and kindness with him. \n\nThe way you handle an entitled child IS NOT the same way you handle a traumatized child.", "YTA. It sounds like you're very sensitive about him, both about his behavior and his origins. When the teacher called you with behavior concerns, you clearly didn't believe her and pushed back with your personal narrative that it's normal for his age. But it's not-- teachers don't call home about normal behavior. It doesn't mean your kiddo is 'bad,' it means they need help and support. \n\nThen when the teacher asked if there's anything going on at home that might be affecting your kid's behavior, you got aggressive and insulting. It's not being nosy--knowing about their home situation can help a teacher provide the right kind of support. They can try to notice if there's a connection between a kid acting out and mentions of parents in books or by other kids. They can listen in to see if some of the things other kids are saying might hit an extra nerve with your kid because of their situation, and correct it. They can get the school counselor involved if the kid needs somebody to talk to. \n\nOn top of that, you're consistently arguing with judgments, which is against the sub rules.", "YTA. She had concerns and, rather than punish your nephew, she was trying to get to the root of the issues and actually help him. If he was struggling at home or had something emotional going on, she could offer accommodations that might be more effective than punishments.", "YTA---shes trying to help. Shes asking about his home life because thats often a cause of behavioral issues at school (which you dont seem to want to take seriously)", "YTA. You are telling us internet strangers the facts, but not your nephews teacher.\n\nWe don't really care, she would.", "**THIS WAS POSTED BEFORE**", "You shared his circumstances with all of us. Curious why that was too much to share with his teacher?", "Teacher got their answer anyways...", "YTA \n\nI am a person who works in schools daily. \n\nIf the child misses their parents, has witnessed violence, knows their parents are away in prison, parents are away on vacation, etc. it IS relevant! \n\nWhy? Because then we can help determine if a child\u2019s behaviour is more emotional rather than having a learning problem. \n\nYou can say to the teacher: \u201cwhat I say is in confidence- not to be discussed in classroom or with others unless they are directly working with my nephew.\u201d It should not be on their record if you are concerned about privacy. \n\nYou are directly hindering your nephew from\ngetting help. When teachers know parents are away on vacation or for whatever reason, extra compassion, patience and if needed, more focus goes into this child. It definitely helps to know what\u2019s happening at home so that we can see if our lesson plans can be geared towards helping this child (and everyone around them). \n\nAt my school, we have done nutrition lesson plans because it was needed for a few students so that all could understand how different types of food originate from different countries and are a part of one\u2019s culture. Parents were happy this was part of our classwork. \n\nWe have done lesson plans regarding different family backgrounds and anti-bullying to help fight against racism and prejudice in the classroom. Parents had been involved and were happy the children were receiving this type of education. \n\nWe have even done lessons on diabetes and the student who had it wished to read a book to the class about it. Parents had wanted this also. \n\nAt my school, students have access to counselling and other services and extra help with reading etc. The teacher needs to know the details and maybe your nephew may be eligible for extra services etc. you don\u2019t know that. \n\nTeachers and school staff make a home away from home for kids. All details are relevant and help shape the work students do in class, and the interactions of the humans around them at times. \n\nIf you are the only parent your nephew has known, then it\u2019s different, it\u2019s a single parent home and no trauma etc. and still then you can discuss how your nephew is doing at home and hobbies they have. I would re-do the meeting with the teacher. It sounds like they are trying to help. When you give in this case, your nephew will receive.", "If his behavior is just fine why were you meeting with her about him? Really parent teacher conferences. Talked to her in passing? If the meeting is specifically about his behavior then maybe you should reevaluate his behavior.", "Info:\n\nare you and your son (do you consider him your son? Is there a chance that after this \"long time\" he will be reunited with his parents? Does he think that?) in therapy or receiving support in some way? He had 5 years with his parents and then something traumatic happened and he was taken in by you. It's a BIG DEAL for a child, even if you are a loving and attentive parent now.\n\nI can tell, and obviously so can the teacher now, that you are incredibly defensive about this. Being defensive isn't helping anyone. Your kid needs a little help with his behavior at school. This is normal but it also can be exacerbated by his transition to your care. So if someone is facilitating your relationship (a caseworker, a therapist, etc) it might be a good idea to talk to them about how to handle questions from school.", "YTA. What\u2019s going on at home can certainly impact how a child behaves in school. Maybe she was asking to gain insight re: how he\u2019s been acting out in class and see if there are way she or the school can support him. It sounds like you got defensive rather quickly.", "YTA\nA caring teacher will ask about home life out of concern. They only want to help the child. You are also assuming his behavior is normal and that of any other child his age when obviously the teacher is bringing it to your attention because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s your responsibility to guide your nephew and correct behavioral problems, not disregard them.", "OP, it is not unusual for a teacher to ask questions about a student\u2019s home life in order to better understand and support them in the classroom. It is **normal** for a teacher to do this. It is not an accusation against you or anyone else in the child\u2019s family. The teacher was asking for your help because you both need to work together to support the child. You are on the same side here.\n\nIf you feel she wasn\u2019t clear enough about the behavioral problems she was seeing, just ask her to clarify. Ask her again if you still don\u2019t get it. **Assume good intentions.** You are raising a child and you need allies. The child\u2019s teacher is almost certainly trying to be one, so give her a chance.\n\nNAH because you are trying to do the right thing by raising a child that is not your own and you are probably under a lot of pressure. But please rethink your attitude here.", "YTA, first and foremost, no most boys are not disruptive in class, which is what the teacher was trying in a diplomatic way to tell you. Understanding the reasons behind this disruptive behavior will help the teacher work with your nephew in controlling his behavior better. Your job as the guardian is to help this child, not make excuses for or ignore behaviors that in the long run will result in disciplinary actions for him. While it's understandable that you may not want to give to many details surrounding why his parents are \"away\" for an extended period of time, but your nephew is being disrespectful to both his teacher and classmates with his actions that you are excusing as boys will be boys behavior. And given your over reaction here, it is understandable where he gets the attitude from. So, you have a choice here, be an adult and do what is actually in the best interest of the child and figure out how to teach him not to be disruptive and disrespectful whether with the help of his teacher or a counselor. Or get ready for many more meetings where your nephew is escalating his behaviors for attention to the point he is no longer welcome at school.", "YTA. Teachers ask these questions because situations at home came affect the way a child behaves in class. She may also be trying to get feedback about his home behaviour so she can have a better picture of your nephew. If she suspects ADHD, ODD, other neurodivergence\u2019s, learning disabilities or even mild anxiety and depression, she needs a full picture of your nephew\u2019s life and behaviour before she can start the process of making his life at school smoother but getting him the tools and help he may need to succeed. \n\nYou\u2019re also ignoring the fact that his behaviour in class is such, that she has brought it to your attention. Teachers don\u2019t normally bring, not paying attention or talking too much in class, to a parent or guardian\u2019s attention unless it is causing an issue in the classroom and is affecting the student\u2019s ability to learn. The fact she has noticed these issues, is making you aware of them and trying to understand where these behaviours are coming from shows she has an invested interest in your nephew\u2019s learning and wants him to be successful at school.", "Edit: YTA\n\nit's reasonable for a teacher to ask about home life as it can and does affect kids at school. They maybe don't need to  ALL of the details (Like WHERE his parents are or WHY they are away... but maybe helpful for them to understand yes they are away and whether or not they're in contact).\n\nMaybe she is just nosy, but more likely she just genuinely cares about her students and noticed he was off. I can't imagine a whole lot would change in the classroom, how she teaches, etc but they could offer a guidance counselor, offer more support, be more sensitive about certain subjects, maybe offer more leniency or understanding about shit that may be affecting him. \n\nMy son is only 3 but I would let his daycare know about changes at home, like if a grandparent passed away, Dad moved out of the house, new sibling, etc.. anything that could affect how he is acting. Once I had to remove someone from his emergency contact sheet and while I didn't explain why, they needed to know it'd be a problem if that person showed up trying to pick up my son and I made sure that was clear. \n\n Teachers also are mandated reporters, so if they notice the kids saying something or showing signs of neglect, abuse, etc they need to report it. Sounds like you've been the legal gaurdian for awhile, so this is unlikely the case but if a teacher overheard a child say they've been staying with an Uncle or someone different than who is listed like Mom and Dad and they still had the parents listed as gaurdians then it would raise a red flag as to \"why aren't they with Mom and Dad or is there an issue at home that I need to report?\" If the teacher had been referring to Mom and Dad this whole time as if the child still sees and talks to them regularly, it'd be nice if they knew the child hasn't seen them in years or if they haven't even talked before. \n\n\nIf you think your nephew isn't affected by his parents being gone for years and changing his home/gaurdian at age 5 - you are in denial. If you think home life doesn't affect kids at school, you are in denial. He may be handling it well, but I still I think you were an AH to the teacher. You didn't have to tell her specific details or spill the tea/gossip, but a general of \"no he's been fine at home\" or \"yeah he is still missing them or having a hard time with them being gone\" etc. Maybe explain how long he's lived with you, how long his parents are away for, whether or not that is changing soon, if he talks to them at all, etc. Or simply say \"he came into my custody 3 years ago\". Whatever.  It's clearly is a sensitive subject since you reacted this way but you did your nephew no favors.", "So his teacher *cared enough* to ask about your nephew's home life and you assumed she was being \"nosy\" because... why? Your circumstances are just that interesting?\n\nI can almost guarantee she was asking out of professional concern and is probably understating his difficulties in the classroom in order not to awake your ire. A lot of teachers have to be very diplomatic these days due to parents taking offence at hearing that their little darlings aren't perfect. And congratulations, she'll probably never be honest with you again.\n\nI suggest getting over yourself, not saying the first rude thing that pops to mind when someone says something you don't like and doing what's best for your nephew (hint hint, that's being aware of the *reality* of how he's doing). \n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nHaving a \"non-traditional\" family situation can definitely negatively impact a child's mental health and cause them to act out. Your nephew may require additional support that you are denying him by getting unreasonably aggressive and defensive.", "YTA.\n\nThere is no reason to get so hostile at an innocent question. The teacher may be trying to accommodate your son, and help him. You didn\u2019t give her a chance to explain *how*, or *why*. You *immediately* shot her down and closed the conversation. \n\nDon\u2019t let your stubbornness/pride get in the way of your kids education. If you don\u2019t address the problems (which there obviously is, she called a meeting), they will only get worse. These behaviors should be nipped in the bud while he\u2019s young. You need to communicate with her. It\u2019s not about \u201cyour business\u201d. It\u2019s about *his*. \n\nYou come across as hostile and controlling, which is honestly scary. I personally acted out in school bc my home life was inconsistent and traumatizing. He might need therapy being away from his parents.", "YTA. Maybe your nephew has been saying things about his parents at school. Even if not, it's pretty normal for a teacher to ask if anything at home might be influencing troubling behaviour in school.\n\nYou jumped straight to \"you're a sorry excuse for a teacher and a human being,\" unbelievable that she was able to keep things civil.", "It's possible the teacher overheard the child talking about home and is nosy, but teachers are busy and I doubt they would go out of their way to create more drama when not warranted.   \n\nDo you have official/legal custody of this child?  Are you worried they could take him away?    If so, I get why you're defensive.   That said, get legal custody and it's not a problem.\n\n\nYTA for your behavior, not your desire to protect the child.", "As a teacher, if she\u2019s taking time out of her day to call you, it\u2019s not typical behavior (or beyond typical amounts of that behavior) and is an issue. We don\u2019t have time to make home contact that doesn\u2019t need to be made. Knowing about a child\u2019s home life/background is important for teachers to provide the best education and help possible. I guarantee she didn\u2019t call just to be nosy, and you were incredibly rude to someone who is trying to do her job and help the child.", "As a parent of 3, YTA. Here's why:\n\nTeachers need to know how they can help students. You are assuming he is acting like every other boy...maybe he's doing it more? You aren't there, you don't know. \n\nYou say he's okay...Kids tend to hide feelings. He may not be. Did he go to any form of counseling? That's recommended for children whose parents are not custodial.\n\nThe teacher already knows there's a situation because you are listed as a guardian. Your job as a guardian is to keep him safe, to provide for him, and to allow others help you help him. This includes teachers and school support staff.\n\nActing like this only makes it look to them like you have something to hide, and as mandatory reporters, they can and will call CPS about your behavior. \n\nScrew the gossip, that's your issue. You need to look out for him number one. That's means dealing with whatever talk goes on behind your back and work with the teacher. If he is acting out more than others, he needs counseling.", "\"Sorry, but I don't want to talk about it. It's family business only.\"  \n\n\nYTA for calling someone a sorry excuse for a human being just because they asked a couple of questions.", "YTA. This is one of the MANY reasons why no one wants to be a teacher anymore. Low pay and you have to deal with parents/guardians who act like entitled shit bags when a teacher is doing their job. Try dealing with 25+ young children 10 months out of the year, coming to care about all of them, and then when you are concerned because their behavior is different you get name called and talked down to. Yea maybe the other kids were acting the same way but I put money on the fact that the teacher asked the other parents/guardians similar questions.", "YTA. \nThere are different methods to use especially when the child is acting out from a trauma response. I wouldn't be surprised if there might be an assumption of abuse in the home with your reaction. You need to apologize otherwise if things keep happening in the future they might bypass you for safety reasons and go straight to cps etc.", "YTA. She\u2019s trying to help the child. I would assume the boy said something in class to make her think you weren\u2019t his father. Maybe his behavior is more like depression and she wants to know if something is going on at home. She\u2019s also a mandated reporter. If she thinks he\u2019s being abused or neglected, she is required to report it to the authorities. Maybe you should worry more about what the child needs.", "tbh it sounds like you're in total denial about the possibility that this adopted child - whose adopted parents are in jail for a long time, and who is being raised by his non-blood uncle - might be having a difficult time. YTA.", "YTA. You defensively jumped to a conclusion about 'why' the teacher was asking about the parents. Kids act out for a variety of reasons, which include their own emotional traumas. Some of these things don't manifest right away, and can show up years after the initial situation. The teacher works with children every day, year after year, so she is far more capable than you at judging whether something is 'typical' behavior or not. She needs to know if your nephew has some personal traumas that may need to be taken into consideration or require additional support. You didn't need to be rude, and sometimes an apology - even when you don't think you should give it - is an easy way to move ahead.", "YTA, this information is very relevant and important for the teacher to know.

My son has an absent father, and has experienced domestic violence. He's very sensitive about not having a dad. His teachers always know this, because it helps them talk him through things when he's struggling!", "YTA\n\nThose are valid questions for a child acting up. Problems at home often result in problems at school. She was asking probably to see if he needs to see counseling, resources, or additional help. You overreacted.", "YTA you should be glad that the teacher cares for your nephew so much. So many teachers don\u2019t give a shit, just send him to the principals office and be done with them. But she\u2019s taking time to learn about the child. Behavioral issues in kids are often tied to emotional issues, she\u2019s making sure he\u2019s doing okay emotionally and probably wanted to work with you on helping him get through any emotional difficulties he may be experiencing. Which from what you describe he probably is having some emotional challenges. Missing your parents is really tough on a kid. \n\nApologize to the teacher.", "YTA\n\nSounds like she was respectful and just trying to gather the facts about a kid who is being disruptive/not experiencing the benefits of being in class. Beyond \u201cteaching,\u201d a teacher is a caregiver and needs all the information to take positive steps for the children in their daily care.

Family/home situations are actually one of the top reasons why students of all ages misbehave or have low performance at school.\n\nAt 8, the kid is old enough to know that you\u2019re not his parents and you\u2019re the one raising him \u2014 but at that age his brain is not able to comprehend why. This is why they act out in school. The teacher is concerned and trying to understand so she can be a safe person for him to go to at school, so she can provide help and information in better ways, so she can reach him in ways she can\u2019t right now.\n\nYou\u2019re a major AH by thinking she\u2019s just fishing for information. Why is it none of her business when she has him for 1/3 of the day 5/7 days a week?

The fact that he went through all these things in life and you still genuinely believe that it\u2019s impossible for him to be experiencing issues is honestly concerning. Your reactions to a simple question that every teacher asks when a student is disrupting the class and showing behavioral problems would cause concern for me if I was a teacher.

Sounds like this boy needs a whole new support system because you all seem to be failing him. Stop being defensive, and think about the well-being of the child that you claim to love and want to help take care of and less about your own feelings and emotions.

It's a complicated story. He's been with me since he was 5 and calls me Uncle Mike. \n\nHis teacher, Miss L, has been complaining about his behavior. I asked for examples and then asked her if other boys in her class displayed the same behavior because it sounds like typical 3rd grade boy behavior (ie not paying attention, talking too much).\n\nWe really weren't making any progress until she asked me about Aidan's home life. I thought she was going to ask about his sleeping habits. She said \"well meant about his parents.\"\n\nI asked her if this whole thing was an excuse to dig for personal information and if it was, then she's a sorry excuse for a teacher and a human being. \n\nShe was taken aback by my comment and said she didn't know if there was something she should know about. I told her if she has something to say, then say it. Do not waste my time by asking to meet me under false pretenses just so you can fish out why I'm raising my nephew. It's none of her business.\n\nShe said she'd try again when I was not so emotional and I said try again when you're not so nosy.\n\nToday she apologized for everything and said there was no excuse for \"knowing things\" that she didn't need to know. She said she wanted to start over. I think she expected me to apologize and I didn't. I told her I don't hold grudges and apology accepted.\n\nMy brother and his partner adopted Aidan at birth. Both of them are away for a very long time. I wasn't going to let Aidan go into foster care so I took him in. He's doing quite well.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a perfectly human response. \n\nI'd say reach out to a parent support group for parents with similar relationships with their kids and child services may just be a place if someone is needed to guide their unpacking of mom/dad as they get older (therapist, mentor, etc). Kids always notice what is different and can internalize it, not saying this is the case, but it does happen a lot with lingering questions about core life events. \n\nGood luck, you're a great person for taking this own for your son.\n\nAlso 3rd grades are wild. Self regulation is hard at that age. It could be something different like Miss L is boring and my friends are hilarious.  Kids are great.

You're clearly still very new to parenting, and you're projecting sexist and damaging ideas and assumptions onto him. Stop your \"boys will be boys\" attitude and work WITH his teacher to address what is not normal or OK behavior in a third grader (boy OR girl). This is part of parenting. I can think of dozens of possible things a parent can/should do in this case and it's not yell at his teacher and write off everything your kid does as \"boys will be boys\"--which is a 1 way ticket to raising a NIGHTMARE teenager and shitty adult.\n\nIf he's being disruptive and talkative in class, he's not learning and something is off. That doesn't bother you? You could be holding him back from an ADHD diagnosis that would change his life (in a positive way) or from working on positive social behaviors that will smooth his way for future school, work, and life accomplishments. Emotional regulation is literally your job as a parent to teach and you're not doing it--with him or yourself.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t really give a lot of details but from what you did mention, it sounds like she back tracked really quickly(out of a sense of self awareness) and your nephew is a normal kid with normal kid problems. \n\nTo the point of \u201ckids problems in school directly correlate with their problems at home\u201d agreed and if he\u2019s in a safe environment with emotional support he\u2019ll be expressing himself authentically so that he can get to the root of how his life, this far, affected him. Being respectful in class is one thing but making things into problems that aren\u2019t problems can really confuse a young humans perception.", "Good for you. Keep up the good work!", "Dude this guy is NTA because every teacher/nosy jerk in general thinks that if the parents aren't involved then everyone wants to call CPS and remove them from the uncle or the guardian that is actually caring for that child just because it doesn't fit their personal ideology. She's being nosy, it's not her business. That boy is just doing normal 3rd grader things that aren't even that bad and the teacher suddenly wants to know his whole gruesome backstory to see if it fits HER IDEOLOGY. Fuck her.", "YTA I hope you go back to the teacher and apologize, explain the situation so she can have a better understanding of how to help.

You know the videos of kids starting at a line together and they take a step forward if their parents graduated, are married, etc? That's the same thing. It's a way for the schools and teachers to learn information about students families that they do not need to know. (Our preschool even asked if my child was born via c section or not....it literally makes no difference) \nThe family dynamic does not matter so long as the kid is happy and healthy. \"Is your home chaotic?\" Would have more along the lines the teacher should have been askign about even while still being intrusive", "NTA - as long as you're this child's guardian, the circumstances by which that happened are none of her fucking business. Good for you for explaining that to her.", "NTA", "NTA.  The teacher had the wrong approach.  She should have delineated the nephew\u2019s misbehaviors by dates and in detail.  Instead of asking about the home life, she should have quoted anything disturbing or disruptive that the child had said.  Her intentions may have been innocent instead if just nosy, but her approach was wrong.  She needs to give a valid reason for asking before she asks.", "NTA, if this was an excuse and he is really not behaving like that, she is the AH, she can mind her own business.

The reason I say you are NTA is because you are in a precarious position and need to defend your child, but the teacher could and should have just come right out and asked what she needed to know and why. You were defensive but it wasnt because you just wanted to argue. With all due respect to everyone else, I am leery of teachers and how they are unnecessarily ignorant on some things while causing stress for others.   \n\n\nBy the way, I was a teacher once too, so everyone who wants to say I dont know what I am talking about....I actually do.", "NTA  It really isnt her business.

My kids have a very complicated situation regarding their bio dad and it\u2019s not something I like sharing with people. Based on your wording I suspect you and I have somewhat similar situations. \n\nI do share it with their teachers/school because it can very much be relevant to behaviors or emotions teachers see.

Most importantly, it gives my kids more trusted adults who can help them with the situation if needed.", "So perhaps you can just take a breath, a step back, and realize this isnt a personal dig on you or your parenting, its the teacher trying to help anyway she can. One thing that really helps my boys with school in incentives and constant reminders rountines. Still- we get the occasional teacher talk. What your saying about boys is true- but ypu can help but reading with them more at home, making it fun and doing it with them in small increments is what works best for us -also throwing in some fun crafts and such , right now were making a tiny town for christmas :)) no one thinks your not doing your best- its admirable that you took on your nephew in a tough time. Im getting off topic but my point is - the school will work with you anyway they can, and in turn you can make it easier for him also. God bless you for taking on this boy ! Your a saint, and should handle this situation with as much grace and good as you can!!", "YTA A kid that was adopted and then abandoned by his adoptive parents. Yeah I\u2019m sure he\u2019s doing great dude.

You took it upon yourself to ensure she never makes that mistake again.", "Yta.  As someone who interacts with your kid, it is helpful for her (and if it is helpful for her, then it is helpful for your kid) to know context... then she apologized and asked to start over and you basically gave her the finger.

All you can do is try to mitigate things but that means you have to be honest and ACCEPT HELP.\n\nLook I get the shame. Really I do, but you're gonna have to put YOUR feelings aside because it isn't about you. Its about Aidan.\n\nMy favorite uncle was locked up pretty much my entire childhood, which also meant the ENTIRETY of my youngest cousin and his daughter's childhood. All she had were calls and visit when her mother could swing it and make the not to quick journey to Desert Sands. That contact made things better than just years of silence but him being gone like that still had a negative impact on her regardless of everything our family did.\n\nYeah he's 8 now but he won't be forever and if he doesn't know the situation in a way that's currently appropriate for his age you are setting both of you up for one hell of a fight. Your reasons for keeping this from him(if you are) won't matter to him. He's gonna be a hurt kid who doesn't have his parents but does have an uncle who lied to him. For Years.\n\nI'm assuming he doesn't know because little kids have no filter so short of you drilling it into him to NOT talk about his parents and where they are(also a gotdamn problem) his teacher would have heard about that fact by now. \n\nSo yeah road to hell good intentions and all that. You owe Aidan the truth and an apology(and FFS please find a therapist for him because you're not equipped to help him deal with this) and that goes double for the teacher. Again this isn't about you. Its about Aidan and whats best for him.", "YTA, and Christ for a reaction like that damn straight I\u2019d be concerned. Kiddo is having issues at school, which as most people know, can be an indicator of a greater issue.", "YTA\n\nThis is absolutely her business. If she sees issues in the classroom, there might be something going on, and thank god teachers notice these things and ask questions. \n\nHe probably did experience trauma as an infant, even if he doesn't remember it. It can still cause issues as a child and adult.", "YTA, she acted how a teacher should act and from reading how you went into this situation you were pretty much hoping for someone to ask about your nephew's home life so you could \"dunk\" on someone.", "YTA for being unreasonably defensive", "YTA\nNo it\u2019s none of her business. But if want to help your nephew what is the harm in telling her?? I can\u2019t see how you telling her some info will be used against you or your nephew. \n\nIf someone is expressing help. Take it. \n\nBoys overacting in class is not normal. She must have seen a behaviour different than other children therefore her knowing the family dynamic can help her guide you and nephew to resources or tips to succeed.", "YTA She said that his behaviour is problematic. As someone who teaches 3rd grade kids for a living, I think she'll probably best placed to say whether or not it's typical behaviour. I seriously doubt she's all that interested in any kids homelife for prurient reasons. If you're asking for specific examples, you're not getting the problem - constant low-level bad behaviour may well be symptomatic of trauma. Your nephew has been through a lot, let people help him. Over-defensive parents or guardians can just stand in the way of kids improving", "YTA, she was asking to try to help and understand his behavior. Teachers aren\u2019t being nosy, it\u2019s out of concern and looking for the best approach to help. She backed down because she saw you weren\u2019t happy and knew that any more inquiring was going to cause issues for the child at home. She is aware that he\u2019s struggling like from his parents being in jail (assuming but likely given your hesitation in opening up here and there).

A teacher could also get CPS involved if the behaviour is really bad.\n\nTalk to the teacher at least apologise for just being defensive and overly protective. Have your guard up yes but not too up that stops you from seeing help when it's being offered.", "I want to say NAH because it seems clear you're working hard to make a good life for this kid, but you also seem to be having an unproductive reaction to the teacher. You sound defensive and like you're rejecting her concerns -- is it possible you're either feeling burnt out by all the work of raising a child and her concern sounds like judgment of your parenting?\n\nIt seems deeply unlikely that the teacher is prying due to inherent nosiness. Teaching is hard work and not paid particularly well; most teachers I know do it because they care about the children. She is probably just trying to help and I encourage you to hear her out for the sake of the child.\n\nI also encourage you to make sure you're doing what you need to take care of yourself as well. Parenting isn't easy!", "YTA. she likely was looking for anything that could impact your nephews behavior ie. A recent move, divorce, death, etc. Maybe he's being bringing up his parents in class and mentioned you're his uncle. So the teacher may be wondering if this is a recent thing or if something has come up to change his situation. \n\nGuardians/parents and teachers have to work together. I highly doubt she cares that you're raising your nephew. She just wants to be aware of anything she may need to  compensate for in the classroom.", "YTA\n\nI worked with teachers and this is a normal question. It's part of their training. If the child is acting out then she needs to understand if the is the child's normal personality or just school behavior to accommodate and accomplish her education goals. \n\nLashing out a someone who is just trying to do their job is a dick move.", "YTA. You could've said that you'd rather not talk about the reasons you're raising him. Maybe reassure her that there isn't anything she needs to know, like about abuse from his parents that she needs to report. That is her job. It's normal for teachers to have to call dcfs. Your first reaction was very intense. I would seek anger management somehow.", "Sorry but YTA.  And you arguing with everyone doesn\u2019t help your case. \n\nIf the teacher has noticed disruptive behavior with any of her students, she\u2019s obligated to reach out to their parents/guardian.

You don\u2019t seem receptive to the answer.", "Absolutely yes, YTA. The teacher asked a universal baseline question and you jumped on her assuming you knew her perspective.

So it was important that my teachers knew that about my home life so they could help me when I had a bad day. Your son may be showing signs of not being as emotionally ok as you think he is during school and the teacher needs to know how to approach that. But you just closed the door on that teacher going the extra mile this year.", "You had no problem telling us, a bunch of strangers online, what the situation with Aidan's parents was.  Why would it be so difficult to explain to the teacher.\nFurthermore you are entrusting this person in the care and well-being of Aiden during school hours.

I hate to break it to you, but your life is not so interesting that a teacher wants to know every detail.  She wants to know if something at home is being picked up on by the other kids and used to wind him up. Or affecting his mental health, sleep pattern etc. Right now I'd say her conclusion is \"acting parent volatile and aggressive\". Real parents care about their kid's mental health and education,  and if your son is being disruptive,  he's preventing other kids from getting their teacher's full attention, and that's out of order. Dial down your attitude, apologise to the poor woman and work with her to help him get the best out of his school life.", "YTA.

They may have ADHD or autism. I wonderful smart kids with both of those conditions.

The kid is having issues and his parents aren't around, that's a thing the teacher SHOULD know.", "A soft YTA. I can fully understand why you're overprotective towards your kid, but her question sounded pretty standard to me. When children are having behavioral issues, it's normal for teachers or other staff to inquire about their home life. I get that the kid has probably been through a lot and you're doing your best, but please understand that the teacher was likely just doing her job and not trying to pick apart your personal life. She just wants to understand him better so she can adjust how she interacts with him; so hopefully, in turn, he can start to do better.", "Dude the way you reacted probably set off some alarm bells.

My son (5m) has never met his bio dad and his bio dad wants nothing to do with him. I have shared this with his teachers so they can let me know if he is having any behavioral issues at school. I have also consented to him talking with a Child and Youth Worker multiple times a month at the school. I have also informed them that I am expecting a baby in April, and to please let me know if they notice behavioral changes in my son. Being open and honest with school teachers not only helps the teachers but the child as well.

Goodluck!", "Soft Yta. I understand trying to protect your nephew, and his personal information. However, if there is a trauma involved, it could help the teacher to be aware. My daughters (five years old) teacher is aware about my daughters ptsd, and the traumas surrounding it.

Only it's something really, really important for teachers to know about a kid who's experiencing sudden behaviour changes. The teacher works with 3rd grade boys for a living--she knows what's \"normal 3rd grade boy\" behaviour and what isn't. Your nephew isn't displaying \"normal\" behaviour, and he may not be displaying behaviour that's typical for him. When kids are suddenly displaying changes, the first thing anyone in a social services (education, health, welfare, etc) position is going to ask is, 'what's going on at home?' because there are big links between home life & outside-of-home behaviour. And if the answer is 'nothing, everything at home is normal,' great! They move on to doing things like psychoeducational testing if they suspect it could be something like ADHD.

I could not care less about my students\u2019 parents\u2019 personal lives but it makes my job infinitely harder when a student is going through major issues and I don\u2019t know/can\u2019t help them work through their emotions or can\u2019t anticipate some extra challenges. \nI\u2019m going to gently say YTA-in the future I\u2019d recommend explaining that you\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal details but that custody has changed which might cause some extra tension/behaviors for a while.

If I know the person bringing them in isn\u2019t mom or dad, I ask about the parent situation to see if that may be playing a factor into behavior (because I can guarantee you 9 times out of 10, it\u2019s related to that).

Trust me, teachers are tired and not running around trying to dig up dirt on their students' private lives for entertainment. \n\nOften there is one kid who really stands out in disrupting a class & it is a teacher's job to suss out if there is stress in the home or possible learning disabilities. 8 or 9 is when kids do get diagnosed. In Aidan's case, he may have some trauma from being an adoptee then losing the only parents he knew and now being under your care\u2013\u2013 no matter how great you are with him. That's a pivotal age and loss of primary caretakers can lead to trauma and attachment issues that show up as acting out for attention. \n\nStop being defensive. Go apologize to her.

Not paying attention and/or talking too much can be signs his needs are not being met at home and therefore his learning is being impacted. So much so that this teacher is reaching out to you. \n\nYou can keep the explanation simple: I'm taking care of my nephew now and for the foreseeable future. Most teachers will take that into consideration and make adjustments as needed. We see and meet with families that are just like yours on a regular basis. As long as the child as someone outside of school who cares about them and for them, we don't care who it is or how they're related (if at all). \n\nWork WITH the teacher to help your nephew, not against her.

Teacher showed concern. You were rude.  Teacher was the bigger person and apologized, and you wouldn't even reciprocate.", "Wow YTA. She was being concerned for him, not being nosy.

I think you are a little bit TA for responding harshly, because you could\u2019ve gotten your point across in a tactful way,  but I do applaud you for telling her to mind her own business! \n\nShe was absolutely being nosy. I don\u2019t believe for one second she would\u2019ve changed the way she educates him based on his history. I also think that the teacher needs to provide each and every child with the same amount of compassion, regardless of their background. They shouldn\u2019t need know their sob stories in order to handle be kind and patient. When I was enrolling one of my children in school, the form asked if they were born vaginally or by C-section. I went to the desk and asked why that question was on the form. She looked a little confused, but said some children learn differently, based on how they were born. I asked for an example on how they would educate my vaginally born versus C-section born children, and she could not provide an answer. It was removed from the form!", "YTA\n\nThat information IS her business. She is his teacher. Knowing home life situations helps teachers adjust teaching strategies.\n\nFor example: back when I was student teaching (11th graders), I had a student in my 1st hour who slept through half of my classes. Normal protocol was to wake the student up and keep them focused, but I found out from my mentor teacher that this student had a 1-year-old at home and the baby was going through sleep regression. Knowing that, I decided to let the student sleep when they were tired and told them they could come back during study period if they needed me to go over anything they missed while sleeping. (they were a very bright student and got As in my class so it was never a problem, they were just tired!)\n\nKnowing that Aidan's dads are away from home and he's staying with his uncle for the time being is enough. She doesn't need to know all the details of everything that happened, but knowing that Aidan might be struggling with those things will help her with teaching him. \n\nAlso, if you're worried about this info becoming 'everyone's business', look into FERPA. Information about Aidan's home life would be protected by FERPA, so only 'individuals that need to know for educational purposes' would be told. The teacher, the principal, the school counselor, and any special services Aidan gets (speech therapy, physical therapy, etc.). If anyone else were to find out, you could sue the school and people would be fired over it. So if you want to say \"I will tell you this but please respect FERPA\" then that will make it clear to the teacher that you have an expectation of privacy about all of this.\n\nEDIT: as for why I could give the example above: enough information was removed that you would not be able to identify the former student in question, which is the crux of FERPA. Now if I had said \"this student in my second grade class at X elementary school in Y state from 2022-2023\", that would violate FERPA because it narrows things down enough that you can research the 25 kids in my class and figure out which one I'm talking about.", "YTA.\n\nThe teacher wishing to understand his home situation was totally reasonable and understandable.\n\nYou quite obviously have no understanding at all of child development and even less understanding of how to manage basic situations appropriately.\n\nIf thus is your approach to the teacher, then I hope she's raised a record of concern regarding your conduct, as you've made what shouldn't be a shameful situation for the child into some dirty secret with you presenting yourself as some sort  hillbilly lock keeper chav!", "This is a typical approach??

Like it or not, teachers are going to connect to your children at a personal level. They literally spend half their waking hours with them for like 180 days.\n\nLet me talk about an extreme example. Partner used to work with smuggled kids. Usually cartel victims who were being used as mules but escaped and went into ICE custody. Obviously, she didn't even have parents for these kids for her to talk to and the legality around direct questions is really iffy so she can't go trying to ask an underage person what horrible or shitty things they've gone through.\n\nThey *can* volunteer information when talking to their teacher about why they're struggling. There was one kid who was particularly problematic. Obvious signs of PTSD. The adults at the orphanage where he was staying were afraid of him. None of the teachers assigned there could speak Spanish except for my partner.\n\nShe decided to take a bit of a gamble and sit with the kid with just a single monitor in the room who would help if this kid got violent. She asked him what's going on with him and said it's OK if he couldn't speak about it but that she wanted to be there for him.\n\nHe broke down sobbing about a cartel he was basically enslaved with. Took him and his girlfriend from their homes when they were like 14. Beheaded her in front of him at 15. Committed tons of heinous acts of SA on him and forced him to carry drugs for them. Kept forcing him to watch as they brutally murdered people. He eventually ran for it when they were near the border and he was detained and brought to the shelter cause he was still a minor and couldn't be immediately turned away.\n\nThis kid got access to psychological care to treat his PTSD and medication to help regulate his emotional state and all kinds of things. He is just one scared young boy and happened to have a voice of someone who actually made the effort to listen.\n\nObviously this is the most horrific and extreme sort of situation. That kid had nobody to help be his advocate until *finally* someone who could understand and wanted to understand him came into his life.\n\nLiterally any teacher worth their salt wants the same for their kids. They want to make sure everything is tuned to the best possible state of things to help ensure the success of their students. In spite of all the testing and mandated bullshit of the local and state governments they want to keep working for their kids above all else.\n\nIf a teacher's asking you about personal life stuff for Aiden, it's to do the best she can to help him be the best he can. Your hostility is screwing that up big time. They want to be a voice and advocate for the kid.

When they do family in class she could include more examples of children being raised by different members of the family. Maybe she can include more books with this so everyone thinks it's more normal. A teacher does actually need to know key information about children so that they can be sensitive and deal with things appropriately.

On those nights she'd kick the kids out and make them sleep outside, regardless of the weather. \"Greg\" slept in class because it was a warm, dry, safe environment and was probably the only rest he could take. My teacher said he'd never felt like a bigger AH in his life. \n\nPoint is, kids don't just act out. When they have tantrums, when they shut down, when they do weird behaviors they'd never done before, there's a reason. They literally can't comprehend some of the things they experience, feel, or see. They don't know how, so they act out. Knowing a kids background helps to understand their behavior and how you should approach them. If anything, OP should be glad the teacher gives enough of a shit to ask.

Uncle sounds like he really cares but can let down his guard a little and widen the kid\u2019s circle of care.", "I agree with everything, except I\u2019m calling OP TA for how viciously he reacted to the teacher.

The parents are away and the kid is with him they don't need moreninfo than that honestly the teacher should have been more upfront about wanting more information about the home life and she should have given real reasons she felt the need to ask.", "A teacher asking about home life is not an overstep. She brought the behaviour issues to the guardian, not to be nosy and find out why for some sort of gossip or personal gain, but to get context for the child. A teachers job isn't to do the bare minimum of handing out papers, writing on the chalk board then sending them home with homework. A **good teacher** finds out the individual needs for struggling students. The kid is not with his parents - the school would know this. That can create stress and confusion for a kid - he may be acting out. Maybe it's even worse. It's the teachers job to assess and address. She has no idea what is going on at home so some context is crucial. She didn't ask \"what, do you not punish your kid? are you beating him? ignoring him? some kind of terrible thing at home?\" ... no, she just asked how his general life was and now the guardian has made themselves out to be suspicious and extremely defensive in not devulging information about home. If a teacher suspects abuse or lack of care/attention to the child (which by definition *is* abuse. it's neglectful) - and they are acting out - they are *obligated by law* to report such. Again, the guardian just made it so much harder for everyone. The kid, themselves, the teacher, the school itself. Now they need to speak about it among themselves (which they absolutely will) and decide if any action should be taken.", "Because connecting with the children you are teaching helps.  Being a robot up in front of them isn\u2019t going to get them excited or interested in learning or help them relate to to things.", "Yeah because I have nothing else to do than to call parents begging for info so I can gossip about their home lives.\n\nMost of us only call home if things are wrong. We don\u2019t do it for funsies.", "Yes, I teach middle school and it\u2019s very common for me to have student who is acting out in some way, and then I find out parents are divorcing, one parent is in jail, older brother is in a gang, etc. I had one kid who would mostly be okay, but randomly have 2-3 bad days every couple weeks or so. Finally found out that his dad had visitation once a month and was supposed to pick him up for a weekend, but kept never coming. Kid always hoped he\u2019d show and then would be a mess for a couple days after when he didn\u2019t. That knowledge allowed me to adjust my approach with him. Knowledge of what was going on at home was always helpful in figuring out what kids needed and what expectations I could have for their behavior or needs. \n\nTeacher may have been trying to figure out if the parents were still in the child\u2019s life, and how that might influence his behavior. Knowing if the parents died, if they were in jail, if they gave him up, if they were addicts who lost custody but showed up periodically and threw the kid into turmoil.", "Him saying that not paying attention and talking too much are normal makes me think so.

I cant tell you how many times I had an asshole student (in high school), talked to the parents, and a light bulb goes off in my head. I feel almost bad for the kids bc they dont stand a chance w such awful parents.", "that was my thought as well. i kinda hope the teacher reports his behavior to CPS just to make sure the kid is actually safe.

If I call you and say your child is unfocused in class that is me saying they refuses to do anything above the bare minimum and tries to antagonise me when I encourage them to try. Because if I say the latter parents think I have it out for their kid when really I am just stating facts and most likley the parents are going to make excuses to not have to do anything and say I should do more to make them do anything - just like the kid does.", "Could also be why OP got so defensive in the first place. \n\nCouple that with his brother and \"partner\" not wife / girlfriend (which leads me to believe that the bro and his partner may be LGBTQIA+) and IMO it's easy to see why OP got so defensive so fast.", "Like you are a social worker who is an actual baby?

It seems somewhat unlikely that both would be deployed at the same time to somewhere they can't bring their kid with them, and in any case typical US military deployments are 6-12 months and this sounds like a much longer term situation.\n* They're astronauts who are up on a long mission. Again, unlikely for both of them, and the longest current manned space missions (ISS) are typically about six months. And if Aiden's parents were astronauts, I expect he would have told the teacher and the entire class by now.\n* They offended Poseidon on the way home from Troy and are cursed to wander for ten years.\n* They made a deal with the faeries and didn't read the fine print.\n\nNone of these seem terribly likely in this case.", "Exactly. It can happen anywhere. I worked primarily in low-SES schools and over the years I've had various students who experienced too many things to count that would break a grown adult. Teachers don't ask these questions to be nosy.

But infants can\u2019t tell the difference; the reaction is the same. Being able to later on understand does not magically erase the harm that was done at the time. This is why it\u2019s currently considered best practice for adopted children to have their birth parents in their lives, to not only help ease that transition but also to heal that trauma. It\u2019s not always possible, and it\u2019s not always what\u2019s best in an individual child\u2019s situation, but as a general principle, it\u2019s considered the best for adopted children.", "It can be.

I can see where she was coming from. Honestly though, not holding a grudge is reasonable.

But talking too much or not paying attention isn\u2019t a reason at all, ever. My mom always worked at my schools, so if teachers had an issue they\u2019ll tell her at lunch. And it was always talking too much or goofing off. \n\nIn no situation is it okay for a teacher to ask such a question unless the child has brought something up to them. Because it really isn\u2019t their business if the child seems healthy. \n\nYeah your nephews having a hard time. His parents aren\u2019t around and his uncles raising him.

She doesn't even know what it is but she noticed. That should be evidence for OP that its not so normal.", "I agree. The kinds of parents who use the \"typical boy behaviour\" excuse are the worst. Instead of acknowledging there are some issues that need addressing, they undermine the teachers and cause more issues with the kid. I have an exact student like this who always replies with \"well my mum said I'm well-behaved and you're a liar\" any time you try to correct her behaviour. It's taxing and unhelpful", "Having been a teacher, if I have to call, you can bet it\u2019s worse than any other boy.

Telling the teachers to give her lots of grace and not be defensive or insistent when giving her instruction really helped her over time in their interactions. Sometimes students want to be called a different name at school than at home, sometimes one parent is much more agreeable or reachable than the other, sometimes the student well tell an admin something that they felt they couldn't share with a parent, so, so many factors come into working in education that people outside of the profession don't think about. \n\nTeachers spend quite a bit of time with your children and many truly just want to do the best they can for each kid. Sounds like OP had his guard up about this sensitive issue and instead of giving the teacher the benefit of the doubt he blew up and got defensive when it sounds like she's just trying to help.

She will want to be equipped for when the conversation turns attention to families. \n\nC) understanding the situation better helps her look out for ways kids will try to pick on Aidan\n\nD) understanding his home life will better equip her for handling Aidan's behavior in the classroom and helping him navigate through difficult emotions.\n\nAlso, no teacher calls home because a kid is too talkative. Maybe, so talkative that he's an active disruption in the classroom? What aren't you telling us, OP?", "I agree with you. Where I am from teachers know a lot about parents so they understand the children and their actions better. Like when parents go through a divorce or someone in the family died then they want to know so when the child is acting out then they know the source. And instead of reprimanding them they can help them regulate their emotions. When a sweet child is suddenly terrorizing everyone there probably are problems at home or somewhere else. Not adressing the problems will make things worse.", "I started acting out in 7th grade. I started hanging out with the kids I shouldn't have. I wasn't doing homework. And it was very out of character for me.\n\nIt's because my mom had died suddenly at the end of 6th grade and I was having a hard time coping. My teachers could have chalked it up to many things. I was in the honors program so maybe I just didn't belong. They could have ignored me and let me just do my thing and focus on the good kids.\n\nBut they didn't. Because my dad informed every single one of my teachers and the school that my mom had died suddenly and I was still working through it. Instead I got sympathetic teachers who gave me some extra attention when I needed it. I got a lot of positive reinforcement. And when they noticed slipping they reached out to my dad to bring hin into the loop.\n\nMy entire life could be different if those teachers weren't aware something was going on in my homelife.

Teachers would often use this information to punish me for things, using these as an excuse, when everyone else would get a pass, and were not outside acceptable norms for anyone else. I was singled out and picked on a lot by staff and teachers. \n\nFor the most part, it is actually safer for those kids who have experienced trauma or are neurodivergent, for their teachers not to know too much. Unfortunately, that is the reality of the situation. My gran and dad were comming into school about 2-3 times a week and demanding to know why other students who had done exponentially worse or were not conforming to expected norms were not being treated in the same manner that they were treating me. \n\nIt was so bad that by high school, I was done. I ended up dropping out of standard public high school, and enrolling in the online alternative school we have. I did really well, and graduated early.

Or is he displaying similar issues at home. The idea behind these questions is to determine if if there is a mental issue, learning issue or physical issue causing problems in the classroom. Teachers are not counsellors and although have experience in all sorts of things, shouldn\u2019t be digging into home life, like knowing if a child is adopted or parents are not in the picture currently.

Both students were 9 and had lost a family member - one lost a sibling and the other a parent. Both students were present when EMS came and attempted to revive the person. It was horrifying to hear one of these kids describe what was clearly (to me as an adult) an overdose. The two students became close friends after that. The two sat there calmly talking to each other, clearly listening and relating to the other.\n\nBut it also meant that I had a better understanding of what was going on with those students and I was able to share that information (that the students both knew more than a lot of adults assumed) with our counselor and the teachers of their siblings so that everyone knew how to support these students and families better.", "This is what really gets me. She had nothing to apologize for but here she is having to go to extra lengths because the OP was a jerk to her and she's trying to smooth over the relationship. Really appalling.", "Exactly! I live in an area that is a big thoroughfare for human trafficking. As a teacher, what started out as a standard parent/guardian contact to help a student back onto the track to success has been redirected to the red flag lane. This response would raise distinct issues and would cause me to have some discussions with principals, guidance, and social workers at my school, with potential cps contact. This dude really messed up! YTA.", "I was one of those inattentive chatterbox kids who got all sorts of extra attention from the teachers and counselors, except I didn't need it. My home life was fine, but the teachers couldn't wrap their brains around the fact that my learning disability was in fact, just a learning disability and not a subconscious cry for help. Maybe it's because they were so poorly equipped to address my real needs, they tried their best to offer what help they had been trained to provide but missed the mark so badly it made things worse.\n\nPro tip: if you're a middle school counselor and a 7th grader tells you their ADHD medicine makes them not hungry, don't tell the kid they're really anorexic and just need you to watch them eat to fix the whole problem. If you do, maybe don't act surprised and offended when the force-fed sandwich gets puked back up on you.", "Oh no, be careful, OP might block you for being to nosy!!!!! \n\nAs if we all don't have 1000 issues of our own.", "I really think he's being protective over the kids and their entire situation. It sounds like there's a lot of back story that might make him feel like giving away too much information will hurt this kid, and his care for him.", "I love number 3 btw. Great Odyssey reference.", "TBF, if it's number 3 or 4, we really won't find out if that's the case for at least 10 years", "They are in my basement.", "She probably told her principal AND guidance, and they told her to apologize bc OP came off sounding like a ticking time bomb and they don't want the kid to be punished for it.\n\nI can almost guarantee that a social worker will be looking into the situation.", "I don\u2019t understand that comment. If it\u2019s his brother\u2019s child, adopted or natural born, he is still the uncle", "Not the OP, but I would think they may have generally redirected that day's class and conversation as a whole, or came up with a reason for the student to be, for example, studying in the library that day", "and it doesn't even matter if it's prison or holiday when \"parents who are away from a long time\" because a child will feel abandoned either way. That causes distracted thinking and acting out in school. OP needs to understand that no matter how \"very well\" this kid is doing in his eyes, his kid is still dealing with his parents not being there regardless of whether or not another family member stepped in. Grandparents will raise their grandchildren when the birth parents have issues- doesn't mean those kids aren't still dealing with a slew of feelings because of it.   \n\nOP- YTA. And just chill the fuck out. Your kid's teacher cares about your kid passing school. She's not interested in gossip about you, you're not that important to her, your kid is", "I do respite and foster care. Knowing this information allows us to better device the child.", "I had a student a few years ago whose dad was in prison, and was released halfway through the school year. The student\u2019s behavior changed drastically for the better, and I was able to build an awesome relationship with him (he\u2019d do work for pretty much only me, probably because I showed him respect and dignity).\n\nHe was one of my favorite students that year.", "I understood that to be OPs meaning as well, that the parents are in prison.  OPs overreaction will only fuel people's curiosity more.  Be honest, and make sure your nephew has access to counseling as the absence of his parents must be emotionally traumatic for him.\n\nYTA.  Be a kind person.  Like the teacher.", "Wherever the parents are, if they disappeared when the kid was 5, he is absolutely GREATLY affected by it and that is information a teacher, who is with him for most of his day, needs to know so she can be aware, respectful, and helpful.\n\nIt also sounds like his \u201che\u2019s doing completely fine\u201d caretaker might be severely underestimating the internal strife an adopted then abandoned (3rd homed) child would be undergoing (the child might not even be aware). And that struggle isn\u2019t a personal slight to OP, you can be doing the greatest job ever in this situation, and a kid with that background is still going to have very reasonable internal strife.", "Well, there\u2019s a reason OP\u2019s reaction is so common.  Kids whose parents are incarcerated aren\u2019t given the benefit of the doubt the way other kids are.  You can talk about researched techniques and trained educators all you want, but the truth is that in the United States of America the school districts with the highest percentages of kids with incarcerated parents tend to be the worst funded school districts because they serve low-income areas.  Class sizes are too large for individual student attention and teachers burn out fast.  The school to prison pipeline is a hard thing to disrupt because it\u2019s political poison to be labeled as soft on crime by your opponents, so recent research can be a hard sell to school boards.  We do not live in a perfect world, we live in a deeply flawed one that fails children far more than society is willing to acknowledge.  Telling people to trust the system instead of their own instincts is not something a casual observer should feel comfortable doing unless they are familiar with the specific school district and the specific teacher.", "Even if the kid is doing fine and that's not the reason his parents are away - there is a huge risk that this child will be bullied by other kids for his parents not being around. If the teacher knows the situation she can be prepared to nip any bullying in the bud.\n\nIt will also change the language the teacher uses in class, if she knows more about the kids situation then she's not going to accidentally make lesson plans or quiz questions that assume all her students live with their parents - for example I remember doing an assignment as a kid where we had to interview mum and then interview dad and half the students were like \"um, my family doesn't work like that\" and the old fashioned, rather traditional teacher we had looked like a right knob. It would have been so easy for the teacher to just make the assignment \"interview the adults that take care of you, eg: mum, dad, grandparent, auntie/uncle or guardian\" \n\nI'm an adult educator, so it's a very different situation, but there are so many instances where I wish I knew more about students, not because I \"need\" to know, but because I've been unknowingly making things hard or awkward in class.\n\nFor example I knew one of my students had children in their teens, and they would often share stories about their children in class, and I'd engage in those conversations, for example this student would share, \"my son is doing the school swimming tournament today\" and to relate this back to our lesson on transport I'd say \"oh, I wish him the best of luck! Did you have to drop him off at the swim centre or does his school get a bus?\" \"my husband drove him\"\n\nThe student was polite and never said anything that would give me pause to think. But I found out from another student who pulled me aside and said \"her son and husband are stuck in their home country because of visa issues, you make it awkward for her by pretending they all live together because she doesn't know how to react\"\n\nI felt like a fucking tool, because of course I shouldn't assume things, but I had, and while my student was doing well, I was unknowingly making class really uncomfortable for her.\n\nIf I'd asked some \"nosy\" questions in private, I could have made class much more enjoyable for her.\n\nBut of course I wasn't just going to start berating my student with questions. We are taught to build rapport and trust first with longer and more open discussions around a student's life.", "Right there with you. Loved my students dearly. Cannot deal with the entitlement of adults.", "This was about 4-5 years back. She'd also hear plenty of the kids talking. And the abuse wasn't just cartels. It was the federal agents and border patrol too. It's not even political. Cops do what they do. Didn't matter who's in charge. When you have a bunch of barely-high-school graduates with anger issues and tens of thousands of minors who are vulnerable AND a system that has strict laws governing their personal stories you have a recipe for some horrible abuses. The system is engineered to protect minors but when the people who feed and clothe and control where you sleep are *all* predisposed for abuse you have nobody to turn to to activate those laws and protections like what my partner got this one kid.", "Of course mental health stuff does exist. And as someone who got called lazy constantly when my home life actually was terrible and I was depressed, I understand. \n\nIt just sucked in class because I actually liked learning (it was kind of my escape from the real world) and it seemed 75% of class time was dedicated wrangling the 20% of people who caused trouble. \n\nIt mostly stopped when AP classes became a thing in like high school.", "He would do well to seek treatment, but we all know he won\u2019t do that willingly", "There probably are or were a lot of other people asking questions out of curiosity/nosiness", "Could be ADHD but could also be a response to trauma.  Bio parents are out of the picture and now his adoptive parents are most likely in prison, kid had definitely been through some shit.", "I'm a pediatric SLP! I ask the same questions because the answers inform my techniques and approach to therapy. Sounds to me that OP is feeling defensive and is untrusting of the teacher. It also sounds that he is burnt out himself and not ready to address the issues by dismissing the concerns as typical grade 3 stuff.", "Occupational Therapists are some of my favorite people. \u2764\ufe0f the work you do to improve the lives of others!", "Yup. I'm not an early childhood expert or anything, but as a former child with both a pretty idyllic childhood and ADHD, what the behavior described pinged that for me.  Might be nothing, in which case no harm no foul, but might be worth getting checked out. And if it's something regarding his general life situation, ABSOLUTELY worth getting checked out. OP's nephew needing extra help isn't a sign that OP's a bad parent, it's just a sign that his nephew needs extra help.\n\nThe number of teachers, parents of kids who needed help (for whatever reason), and actual former kids who had good/bad experiences with teachers re. their home circumstances who are all going \"you need to listen to her, she's not just judging you or being nosey\" is what really drives it home for me.", "Thank you for sharing this story. \n\nThere's so many stories of awful teachers/admin out there (and i know that people have to deal with that and I'm sorry) but so many educators want exactly this. Just information they can use to help students. \n\nI'm so glad your daughter is having a good year so far \u2764\ufe0f", "\u2665\ufe0f I\u2019m so happy your daughter is doing better!!\n\ni was just labeled a \u2018bad kid\u2019 in school and i wish i\u2019d had \u201cnosy\u201d teachers!", "I am a teacher and I would 100% be reporting this situation to guidance. It gives the impression that OP has something to hide and alarm bells would be going off.", "Totally! The teacher is now thinking OP is the problem at home. Not parents \u2018who will be away for a while\u2019.", "This is true; but as somebody who has severe ADHD but no trauma( as far as I'm aware) I wanted to point out that it's not just a crappy home life that causes inattentiveness and excessive talking.", "That is very true.", "True but I wanted to make sure to pint out that it isn't just crappy home life that causes these symptoms.", "My initial comment was a bit vague, but my take on it is that part of the problem is the school's only have a set amount of special assistance available and expending those resources on kids who don't need them means it's not available to the kids who do need those resources. My experience with school resources has been seeing them wasted on me instead of the other students who obviously needed it more than me. My struggles in school were 50% LD related, and 50% bullying by kids who actually had shitty homelives the school refused to address. \n\nI needed a fidget toy in class, a tape recorder for lectures and extra time on math tests, I didn't need 3x weekly counseling sessions during school hours. Guess which option the school went with for me. 50% of my problems would have disappeared if the kid who needed it got that therapy instead of me, and the other 50% would have been fixed by just letting me handle my own learning disability instead of mismanaging it for me.", "I had to go to my grandpas funeral when I was 10, the funeral was across the state so, my teacher gave me a little booklet to document my trip and share with the class when I got back. I told her we weren\u2019t going on vacation and I didn\u2019t want to write in this book, she told me I had to. So I Worte about how me and my cousins ran into the funeral home and saw my dead grandpa laying on a table, I wrote about what he looked like dead v alive. I wrote about the funeral, always open casket on that side of the family. I wrote how my aunt made us pray and when I told her we weren\u2019t religious she freaked out on my dad. I even drew little pictures. \n\nWhen I shared \u201cmy vacation\u201d book, my teacher said after I was done that most kids write about Disneyland and what hotel they stayed in and the \u201cfun\u201d stuff they did. I said, still standing in front of the class, \u201cI told you I was going to a funeral and you made me write about it anyway and I didn\u2019t want to do any of this\u201d. Then I sat down and she sent me to the school counselor to \u201cdiscuss my outburst\u201d. When I went in the office I just told them to call my parents cause I was leaving! Sat there the rest of the day cause they would not call my parents. I felt like a hostage who was in trouble for doing an assignment I didn\u2019t even want to do in the first place. \n\nAfter that, kids in my class thought I was \u201ccreepy\u201d cause I was the kid who wrote about \u201cdeath\u201d and got in trouble for it, that lasted for a long time too.", "I'm so sorry you were put through that. How cold and dense does someone have to be to put a child through that?!", "WTF?!?! What a cold, heartless teacher! I'd be traumatized by that incident as well. My partner/daughters father passed away unexpectedly 2.5 years ago, when our daughter was 4, so I get super anxious about what's said at school that I don't know about when it comes to talking about parents & of course for holiday's like Father's Day (the day we lost him) since she was a self-proclaimed Daddy's Girl & he was the best daddy to her! \n\nI will say that on his bday last month, we went to dollar tree to each get a balloon to release. While waiting in line talking about which balloons we wanted, a sweet older woman in front of us asked who's birthday it is. My daughter's reply was so matter of fact, but made me well up a bit. She said \"Oh they're for my daddy, he died. It's his birthday today, well it was his birthday...you know what I mean. But mom & I are each picking out a balloon to send to him in heaven. Would you like to pick on & join us?\" My heart melted & the woman's face was shock, but kindness & empathy.", "My fiancee/my kids father passed away two years ago in front of us from a brain aneurism, and my girls get so upset when they have anything to do with fathers on a school assignment. Not only did their father pass away, they Watched their father die in my arms. But thankfully schools really don't do fathers day stuff anymore like they used to do when we were younger. I remember when I was growing up in the 90s I felt like alot of our assignments had to do with \"our parents career\". I don't think it's really like that anymore, but losing their father definitely affected their school work and their attitudes at school, and in regular life. Some teachers have been understanding, and some are just plain rude about it.", "I'm so sorry that happened to you. That whole year, but especially that incident.

That was a nightmare to put it lightly.", "As a School Pscyh we love and appreciate you all.", "So true. A generation ago they just saw kids misbehaving. How could you not think this is a better approach? When kids feel better, they do better. A teacher who wants to help your kid feel better is not the enemy.", "I mean, maybe, but I don\u2019t even think that suspicion was necessarily there going into the conversation. Teachers talk to parents about how things look at home all the time; especially if it\u2019s a kid talking too much in class.
