I usually bring my salad to my desk so I can work during lunch. \n\nI have a coworker (let\u2019s call them Em) who is on the autism spectrum. Em likes to make sure that everyone knows she is on the spectrum. Em\u2019s cubicle is all the way on the other side of the room, far away from mine. Unfortunately for me, the printers are right by my cubicle so I get a lot of foot traffic. \n\nEm stops by my desk earlier today and makes a disgusted face at my salad. I had a Cobb salad with chicken, hard boiled egg, avocado, bacon etc \n\nEm goes \u201cthat salad looks disgusting , it makes me wanna barf. I can\u2019t deal with the egg touching the chicken and avocado. I can\u2019t deal with my food touching, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d \n\nI just go \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, Em.\u201d And then turn around and continue my work. \n\nEm goes \u201cyour salad is making me feel nauseated. The food touching and the egg and avocado is triggering my sensory issues and I can\u2019t work in jere with you eating that. Egg doesn\u2019t belong in a salad, it is a breakfast food. Can you go eat in your car?\u201d\n\nI go, \u201cEm, I\u2019m eating at my desk because I have a project to finish by the end of the day. It\u2019s also very hot outside. I\u2019m sure if you go back to your desk and try doing something else, the salad won\u2019t bother you.\u201d \n\nEm then says that my salad with the egg and the food touching is distracting and triggering for her, and that it is ableist of me to not go to my car and leave the room with my salad. I apologize to Embagain and tell them that Im not going to leave my desk as I have a lot of work to do. \u2018Em then says that she is going to meltdown because of me. Em walks back to her desk and I hear dinosaur screeching followed by the sound of her crying and smacking her head on her desk, with her shouting that I am mocking her disability and calling me ableist. Her boss brings her to another room to try and console her. She gets sent home for the day and I get an email from HR before I leave asking me to come in for a meeting tomorrow to \u2018address the incident\u2019. \n\nWhen I brought up the incident to my other friends and partner, they told me I was being unreasonable and that it would not have taken too much for me to finish my salad in my car or someplace else to better accommodate her.\n\nWas I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689826606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154glyl/aita_for_triggering_my_coworker_with_a_salad/", "score": 539, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wasn\u2019t in control, so she manipulated the situation. Plain and simple. Don\u2019t blame yourself. You were minding your own business.

I am concerned for you that HR wants a meeting though. I hope they have your back and not hers.", "NTA. Autistic person here.  If she couldn't handle your food, she should have removed herself from your space.  Instead she chose to stay and she chose to fixate on it and she chose to work herself up over it and only after that did she leave and then have a meltdown, if it even was a meltdown, could be wrong there.\n\nBasic accommodations are always nice.  This is not asking for a basic accommodation.  She is not entitled to control the food and locations of coworkers; if she has a problem with it, she should leave other coworkers alone while they are eating.  You were not eating in her space, she was entering yours.  If I enter a space I can't handle? I leave.\n\nEdit: I see some people making fun of the \"food touching\" thing.  Some mingling textures/flavors can make people feel physically ill almost.  That doesn't mean that they get to control other people's meals, that's not acceptable, but it does come into play when THEY eat and that's fair.  If she is doing office work, there's no way she doesn't know this distinction.\n\nI'm not the only autistic person in my family and some of us have clashing hangups- one for example cannot stand the sound of people eating, and it has caused some problems, but nothing blown out of proportion like this.  There's a difference between accommodating someone and being controlled by someone.  If this is stemming from an intense need for control, that's not something that should be accommodated; that's something she should be working on with a therapist, because that's not reasonable or acceptable.  She can't walk through life controlling everything others do when she is the one entering other spaces; it's her responsibility to leave in that case.\n\nCompare to, say, unpleasant lighting.  Changing unpleasant lighting is a reasonable accommodation.", "REASONABLY PRACTICABLE is a term used in the UK H&S at work act.\n\nIts a beautiful little line and can be used here, was it reasonable that a colleague who has Autism demanded you leave and eat somewhere else?

I don't really get what \"em\" is saying about sensory issues? I have sensory issues and I don't see how looking at a salad would trigger that. For me, I may have a hard time being around someone eating a salad because the dressing can smell very strong\u2014that's a sensory issue, because it affects my senses. The only thing *looking* at your salad is affecting is her eyes, in which case she could just walk away, like you said. I wonder if maybe she also has OCD or some other control issues...? I could see it being a control or obsessive thing, that because she can't eat her food touching, it bothers her a lot when other people eat food touching. \n\nThat being said, every action she does sounds very dramatic and exaggerated and just sort of a parody of what an outsider may think autistic behavior is like.
