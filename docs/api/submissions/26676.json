My Dad (63 M) and Victoria \u201cV\u201d (67 F) have been together for around 4 years. V started out being pretty good to us and my Dad for the first few years. They got engaged a year ago and it\u2019s been downhill ever since. \r\n\nMy boyfriend (\u201cC\u201d, 28 M) and my BIL (33 M) round out our group. About two years ago V started referring to the four of us as \"kids\". Example: we have a family home in a different city, and when we visit V refers to the rooms on the top floor (mine, B's) as the \"kids rooms\". V calling the four of us kids has implications: 1) that we are all related to each other, 2) that we are all the ages of children, and 3) V does speak to us generally as though we are children. \r\n\nWhere it gets tricky is that I asked her to not call us kids anymore, and the conversation went poorly. C and I were leaving our family home after staying the weekend there with my Dad and V. My Dad was outside, and C and I were saying our goodbyes to V. This is the conversation: \r\n\nMe: Hey, I wanted to bring something up to you. Would it be okay if you didn't call us kids anymore? It gives off the impression that we're all related, which is a little uncomfortable, and that we're all young like kids ages, when I'm the youngest of the group at 27. \r  \nV: Yes of course, I won't say that again! But you need to talk to your Dad about that too. \r  \nIt confused me since my Dad calls myself and B his daughters, but never uses the word kids. It threw me for a loop so I ended up saying:\r  \nMe: But he's my Dad...? \r  \nV: I just don't understand why you always give me such a hard time. \r  \nHere's where I might BTA. I got frustrated since she had escalated the conversation out of nowhere, it became irrelevant to what I was politely asking, and she shifted the focus off of her:\r  \nMe: Well, that's a two way street V. The four of us feel this way, not just me. I don't think I've ever truly asked you for anything, so please honor the one request I'm making of you not to call us kids.\r\n\nI didn't want to continue the conversation further so I left out the door and waited at the car. C tells me that after I left, V turned to him and said \"I just got chewed out for no reason\". C walked out as well as my Dad was walking into the house. \rWhatever V said to my Dad was awful enough that it prompted him to storm outside and begin yelling at me, starting with \"Do you want to explain what the F\\*\\*\\* just happened in there?!\". I tried to explain that I had asked V nicely to not call us kids anymore, but my explanation fell on deaf ears. He was yelling/ cursing at me, standing up for V, and even asked if this was \"my biggest grief in life\". I was sobbing the whole time. \r\n\nIt's gone really poorly since then. B mediated a conversation between myself and my Dad, but he only put blame on me and said I owed V an apology (I did apologize to her). I thought it would be a small request, but it blew up into something way bigger than it needed to.

No name calling, no insults, just a hey, I don't like this, please stop. \n\nV escalated with a whataboutism, a guilt trip, and when that didn't work, escalated further by lying to dad and having him flying monkey in to yell at his daughter. \n\nAll over being asked not to use a word, and if it wasn't really that big a deal, why did she escalate it to this mess if it wasn't to play victim?", "NTA. Even if other people do not agree with your feelings about being referred to as \u201ckids\u201d you, an adult, politely asked someone to stop referring to you as a child. And even if they don\u2019t agree, that is something that a respectful adult should be willing to do. \n\nAlso, I do think there is a difference between an adult who raised you continuing to refer to you as the \u201ckids\u201d and an adult who did not join your life until you were also an adult referring to you as a \u201ckid.\u201d", "Hmm. Maybe your dad refers to you as 'the kids' when you're not there?\n\nI'm only suggesting that because my late husband used to use that phrase to refer to his children when they weren't present.  (His 'kids' were a middle-aged man and woman.)\n\nHell, my dad called me 'the bairn' all his days. I was 51 when he passed.\n\nETA I've just read through some of the other comments and this has brought something to my mind. Maybe this is a similar situation? The children in the family feeling slighted when no slight is intended?\n\nOne time, a family group was out having dinner at a restaurant. DH told me to use his card to pay for the meal\\*, so I complied. His daughter saw the card - didn't realise I'd already paid - and kindly offered to split the bill with me. I blurted out 'Oh, it's already paid.'\n\nShe became angry and said 'I'm not a child that has to have everything paid for her!'\n\nI was nonplussed at the sudden burst of anger and tried to calm the situation down by half laughing and saying 'You'd better argue with your dad - it's his card. I just do as I'm told.'  \\[I later realised that the daughter maybe thought that I was trying to take the place of a parent, which simply wasn't the case. The half laugh was maybe not the best way to deal with it, but I was really uncomfortable and trying to avoid upsetting my husband. \\`Her mother was also present at the meal.\\]\n\n\\*My husband couldn't do it himself - he had hemiparesis following a stroke and sight problems.", "INFO: How did you request to be referred to otherwise? Am I just dim and missing some obvious collective noun here?\n\nI just attended a big family shindig with my in-laws. I'm in my 50s, so not exactly a young thing anymore.

Our assorted children were \"the grandkids\", and my grandson was \"the great-grandkid\".", "Epitome of the saying when you have a step mother you have a step dad\u2026 NTA.

If you raised it how you said you are definitely NTA and the reaction of V and your dad was horrible.\n\nOnly thing you could of done better was raise the concern while your father was around, he could of acted the same as he did but at least he would of hear what you truly said not whatever V told him.", "NTA. All of you were adults when she came into the picture, so I can see you feeling weird about the term she's using. And you should be able to ask someone to stop referring to you as whatever without getting screamed at by an unhinged adult.\n\nThat said, what's the alternative? I doubt she's putting a lot of depth into it. It's probably just the shortest way to refer to you all. Are you mad your dad has a gf? That he's about to marry her? Do you resent her and this is why you're so against it?", "Info: You said he took your dad's side, but I thought B was your sister. If your sister took your dad's side, then does she agree with you telling step parent that she feels that way?", "I have to say NTA here. It's clear the people voting the opposite grew up in healthy functional families, blended or not. \n\nFrom the way you've written it here it shows me that V is in a pissing contest with you and is \"marking her territory\" by reinforcing that she cones first to your dad now. You made a reasonable and valid request. You don't like being called that. You don't even need a reason other than you don't like it and that's enough. You asked politely. She deflected and got defensive. You walked away to avoid a bigger conflict after restating your point. Realising she wasn't getting her way she called in the flying monkey, aka Dad, to do her dirty work and set him on you. This resulted in you breaking down (a normal reaction to being screamed at, cut off, and ignored) and eventually you caved and apologised despite doing nothing wrong. In her mind she has now won, but is still pushing the point to reinforce her victory and make sure you don't \"forget your place\" again. \n\nUnfortunately this is not going to change as long as V is in the picture. You'll have 3 choices now: 1) keep giving in and lose more and more as your feelings and preferences are no longer even a consideration while her behaviour gets worse, 2) fight back and don't allow the bullshit but deal with drama on the regular and her stirring the shit pot as a result, or 3) go low contact with both dad and V for your own sanity.", "Question: What do I call my adult children and their partners when we all go on a family vacations together? \n\nI think you're NTA because clearly V escalated when she didn't need to, but I'm just wondering what term I should use to talk about the grown offspring as a group. They're still my kids.", "NTA. It\u2019s odd it only started two years ago, but also why is she referring to the rooms as the \u201ckids rooms\u201d when she can just say \u201cyour rooms\u201d or if speaking to other people \u201cVictoria and [names] rooms\u201d. There\u2019s only two of you, there\u2019s no need to refer to you as \u201cthe kids\u201d. It just feels so impersonal to me, as though she\u2019s distancing herself from you. \n\nBut also her response was very cryptic, then you said a kinda benign reply, so she replied with an intense rebuttal that you apparently always give her a hard time even though I would not describe a minor request (to something that she only started saying 2yrs into a relationship) as a hard time. Whatever she said to your father then clearly was trying to cause trouble because there was no reason for him to cuss you out.", "NTA\n\nBeing called a kid by someone who wasn\u2019t around in childhood is demeaning and meant to let you know where you stand. In her mind she\u2019s telling you you\u2019re less than her because you\u2019re a \u201cchild\u201d while she is about to be \u201cwife\u201d. It\u2019s a jealousy tactic and it\u2019s childish. \n\nYour request was done respectfully and your dads response was a direct result of V most likely putting on the water works and dramatizing the entire event. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to say this but you most likely won\u2019t win this one and don\u2019t be surprised if things continue to decline from here unless your dad miraculously does a 180.", "ESH. It really sounds like you are reading too much into it. My brothers, cousin, and I were well into our 40's, still being eeferred to as *kids* by the older generation of our family.\n\nHowever, if it bothers you all, she should stop. Her reaction was childish and pot stirring. Your dad's tantrum was also ridiculous. \n\n>I was sobbing the whole time.\n\nThis does sound like a kid's reaction, to be frank.", "NTA, even if it is just an ick, she should have respected it. But reading between the lines, \u201ckids\u201d is a tiny part of the bigger problem. You can\u2019t insert yourself into a family, when the youngest one was 21 and start acting like a preschool teacher to your partners children after four years.\n\nShe D.A.R.V.O'd you during the conversation (which she turned into this).\n\nMake sure you have your siblings on your side and go low contact with both. Be a grey rock. Or start calling her dad's roommate until she stops calling you kids. Or dad\u2019s latest fianc\u00e9. Or dad\u2019s future ex wife (if nuclear seems fun to you).\n\nAll the y t a's are moms, using the same lingo (in probably healthy ways that have no overlap with your situation) and are feeling attacked.", "It doesn't seem like she can call you her daughters, so I think referring to you as her fiance's children or kids is probably where that comes from.\n\nThe house is a family house so maybe she didn't feel comfortable calling them the guests rooms as that would sound presumptive (as though the family house was now her house and you were guests).\n\nSo I'm trying to figure out what you expected her to refer to you collectively as?", "NTA-If my dad went ham like you say then there would be no apology.  There would be no talking until he came to his senses.  You did not chew her out but you got chewed out for a dumb reason.", "NTA, you politely requested for her to stop as it made you uncomfortable, which is understandable (to me), and she then lied to your father and got mad at you for something she caused.\n\nSo personally, she's in the wrong, you're in the right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are saying it went downhill from the moment they got engaged and the only thing you are talking about is V referring to the 4 of you as \u201cthe kids\u201d. \n\nTo be frank, my Dad and his girlfriend call my sisters and I and our partners \u201cthe kids\u201d when talking about our old rooms (where we sleep when we visit), or when talking about us as a group to their friends and neighbours: \u201cthe kids are coming over for dinner on Sunday\u201d. We are all in our 30s and 40s. No one ever believed our partners and us are related or assumed that\u2019s what my Dad and his girlfriend are implying or that we are all kids age. And I find it super weird that you, your sister and your partners would think that.\n\nIf she is talking to you like you are still kids and your Dad isn\u2019t saying anything and you have never raised the issue with him, you are all aholes. V for talking to you like kids, your Dad for not saying anything and all four of you for never saying anything.

He is a major Ahole to make you cry instead of having a conversation with you. I will place a small but here: for him to react like that opens the door to either you and/or your sister being hurtful to V in the past and your Dad being fed up by that. I don\u2019t have enough info to be sure about that but if that\u2019s not the case, your Dad is a major MAJOR Ahole to threat you like that over a disagreement with his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nThis is what I understood from your exchange with V regarding having the discussion with your Dad about the kids name: she agreed to your request and ask you to discuss this with your Dad also. I think your Dad is using the word kids to talk about you with her. He probably referred to your rooms as the kids rooms, which she picked on and that\u2019s why she was telling you to have the discussion with your Dad. You could have said \u201cyes, I\u2019ll have that discussion with him too, thanks for agreeing to never refer to us as the kids in the future, it might not seems a big deal for you but it is for us, I really appreciate\u201d (or any other thing instead of getting frustrated). Then have the same discussion with your Dad, ask him if he refers to the four of you as the kid and TELL him you asked V to not use that term when talking about you. She is not saying you are her daughters or her kids. She was using the word kids and had agreed to not use it anymore. \n\nAnd you \u201cbut he\u2019s my Dad\u201d makes no sense. Why would it be okay for him to refer to you as \u201cthe kids\u201d if it implies you are of kids age and related to your partners just because he\u2019s your Dad? That part leads me to believe you don\u2019t want V to refer to you as the kid and you would be/ is okay with your Dad saying it. Which is totally valid, but don\u2019t invent a weird excuse about feeling like it implies your are related to your partners, just say so: we would appreciate if you do not refer to us as the kids since we are not your kids. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like she escalated the situation, it looks like you did and threw the 2-way street respect bullshit and having never asked her anything so \u201cplease honour the one request I\u2019m making\u2026\u201d. That\u2019s sound like she never ever respected you as person. I would be upset if someone was talking to me like that, especially over not being called the kids when she had already agreed to stop.\n\nFinally, she\u2019s the Ahole for saying whatever she told your Dad when he came back in the house.\n\nEdit to add: your title is also misleading, you are talking about your Dad\u2019s *Narcissistic* fianc\u00e9e and nothing in your post proves she is.

The fact OP thinks this is some weird thing referring to her boyfriend and BIL as her actual siblings says a lot, in my mind. Not to mention MIL saying OP always picks on her (paraphrasing), sounds to me like OP has done stuff like this before.

That request was reasonable, you can ask people to call/ not call you something and it really shouldn't be a big deal. OP also said V talks to them as if they were children in general, which is very patronizing. And sobbing after someone starts yelling in your face isn't an overreaction, it's normal.

Which is factually true but might sting a little if she's trying to get along. I would imagine V only calls them kids because dad refers to them that way, when talking about family she probably says \"your kids\", not to mention she presumably lives in a home which still has bedrooms upstairs reserved for her partners kids. \n\nNot sure if thats what's going on but I know plenty of people who call their adult children kids, including my own family, and including people who marry into the higher generation of that family such as my grandmas husband.

My mother calls me, my brother and my SO 'The kids' and none of us have an issue with it. We see it as my partner is included in our family.
