It\u2019s a really small side hustle, I\u2019m basically baking and cooking some easy meals for catering. The business isn\u2019t big, but we have a lot of customers. Me and Matt are white white Kai is Asian (it\u2019ll be important later).\n\nThe business works like that: I bake and cook, Matt runs the SM accounts, Kai does the delivery. We split our gains equally in three. \n\nA few months ago I gave the insta account info to Kai, so that he could post the stories with him delivering the products in real time. It worked perfectly until recently.\n\nMatt got very sick and had to be admitted into hospital. He put a pic of him laying in the hospital bed with the iv in his arm on the story with the caption like \u201csorry the customer service will be slow today\u201d. \n\nAnother important thing about Kai: he\u2019s mentally challenged. I\u2019ll try to be as politically correct as I can, but to be honest it shows. It doesn\u2019t affect what he usually does for the company, but sometimes it gets in the way. He also has quite a temper.\n\nAnyway, Kai saw it and freaked out. He asked me what should he do, I said I\u2019ll handle both the cooking and the customer service. Here\u2019s where I might be TA since I asked him to sort the DMs and answer a couple.\n\nUnfortunately, we had a Karen-type customer that day. Kai answered her, and she decided to give him a hard time for spelling, also mentioning his nationality in an offensive way. He lost it since the day was already stressful, it all stacked up and he sent her a voice message calling her all the nasty things possible. He also went on her profile, noticed that she\u2019s a POC and I guess you could guess the rest. Basically she said a c word and got an n word in exchange.\n\nObviously it caused some drama that I had to resolve. Luckily it got resolved peacefully, but we still lost a customer and possibly some reputation. I decided that it\u2019s not the wisest thing to allow Kai the access to the insta account as he proved himself to be unreliable with customer service. So I asked him to log out, which he did, but he was really upset since he really liked connecting with customers. Note that it didn\u2019t affect the amount he\u2019s paid, I basically took a responsibility off his shoulders.\n\nI feel like an AH because everyone loved Kai\u2019s delivery insta stories. Also, Matt, who eventually said that he\u2019s okay, was against this decision as he believed that the woman provoked Kai.

Now you're properly course-correcting that mistake.", "NTA.\n\nYour actions were reactive to his. Regardless of the provocation, contacting a customer to call them a racial slur is a no-no. Let's not forget, if he's sending her a voice message there is a deliberateness to the actions, he didn't simply blurt the word out in the middle of an argument, he actively sought out her personal information to respond. \n\nNow, whether you allow him to continue to create videos for insa stories that you/Matt post (after review) is another matter. After all, you've got to consider the interest in his inst stories against the possible reputational damage if the customer in question takes offence that he's still working for/with you and still appearing on your SM feed. \n\nBut he's still working there and still getting the same wage, yes? So Kai's been 'punished' by removing a task from his workload, albeit a task he enjoyed.", "NTA - Yeah not a good look for an employee to call a customer a slur, regardless of being provoked. It\u2019s good he stood up for himself but risking the reputation of the company is not a good idea", "NTA. He can still film the videos on his phone, send them to you or Matt and one of you can post them.

You seem to be at a disadvantage in terms of workload", "As I understood, between you 3, nobody is superior and you are running the business equally together.

Now Kai has the idea, that he is not worthy as you two in the business and you are not valuing him enough, which honestly I think is true, and you aren't.\nOne customer and some reputation loss is not more important than the feeling of one of the three pillars of your business.
