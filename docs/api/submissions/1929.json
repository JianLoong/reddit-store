My appartement is situated downtown and there is a lot of busses since it's also next to my school and a highschool. \n\nMy twin brother lives with his best friend in another city and Matt was living with my mother until today. (My dad divorced my mom when my youngest brother was 3 and we never talked to him again)\n\nMatt was always a bit of a delinquent and would always direspect everything and everyone. My mom never did anything about it. But earlier today my mon caught him smoking and drinking in his room. She kicked him out because of it and he only had the time to get a bag of essential. (He can go back to get all of his things later).\n\nMatt decided to come to my appartement by bus and I let him in. I was wearing a sport bra/top and a pair of basketball shorts, It's my favorite outfit and I wear it a lot. After we talked for a bit I decided to let him stay the night and told him we would talk more tomorrow since I needed to take care of my fianc\u00e9e who got into an minor accident a couple days ago. \n\nWhile I was walking to my room he yelled to me how I shouldn't wear such things because it made me looked like an \"easy girl\". I got really mad but decided to not say anything. \n\nI took care of my fianc\u00e9e for a bit before going back into the living room and finding my brother eating and making a mess all over my couch while listening to his show really loud. I was getting even more annoyed and decided to tell him my terms in the moment instead of waiting. \n\nI told him if he wanted to stay I can't let him stay free like that and I don't get money since he dropped out of highschool. I told him I give him 1 month to find a job and he needs to sleep on the couch and he can only brings his clothes since we don't have place for the rest of his things and that in 1 year I want him gone. \n\nHe told me I can't kick him out or force him to do anything especially when he needs to sleep on the couch, like he said \"like a dirty dog\" and then he called our mom who is for stupid reasons on his side and she started calling me a selfish b*tch. \n\nI think I might be the AH for potentially kicking him out since he is my brother but I'm not his caretaker or legal guardian, I don't have time, energy or money to deal with him.", "created_utc": 1668044134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr1shf/aita_for_not_letting_my_brother_permanently_stay/", "score": 261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your mother is so on his side, she can take him back and deal with him. I, for one, would not allow someone who disrespects me like that in my own home, be it my brother or Santa Claus.", "NTA - holy hell, NTA.\n\nYou're not his parent, and your terms are reasonable. He's both free-loading AND being a jerk. In life you should avoid that, but you can possibly get away with one or the other. He just had to go for both", "Nta- put his butt out and force your mom to deal with HER child.", "NTA. Your mom just kicked him out, so she can get off that high horse and cease berating you for something she's responsible for and unwilling to be held to account. Your rules are reasonable, expectations of manners are reasonable, and if he won't comply, not housing him is also perfectly reasonable. Good luck!", "Not your kid, not your problem. NTA.", "NTA- He came into your home and immediately disrespected you multiple times. Tell him to leave immediately. \n\nI\u2019m not familiar with the laws based on age, but I\u2019m not sure if you can just kick a 16 year-old out of your home. He is technically a minor. There has to be some sort of alternative. Are there programs that aren\u2019t explorative and abusive where troubled kids go when their family can\u2019t handle them?", "NTA - he's old enough not to talk to you like that, and to keep a room semi clean.", "NTA, but your mother is for kicking a 16 year old out on his own. What kind of job does she think a kid that age can get?", "NTA\n\nYour mom is on his side because she doesn\u2019t want him coming back to her house. That\u2019s really all there is to it.\n\nHe\u2019s not your responsibility. He\u2019s hers. She\u2019s hoping that by name-calling you she can get you to lose sight of that fact.\n\nDon\u2019t fall for it.", "NTA, but if you want him gone, call whatever your version of child protection services is instead of kicking him out onto the street.", "Kick him out now!!! Quickly. One night is too long. And go NC with your mom please. Oh please go no contact!!! She doesn\u2019t get to call you names for doing something she did when she is responsible for him.

It's a shitty situation but it will only get worse if you allow it.", "NTA.", "You're not the asshole. You gave him generous terms. He can't stay with you and treat you or your home like shit. Send him back to your mom. It's not your responsibility to discipline an out-of-control teenager.", "NTA.  If he is being disrespectful right from the start it isn't going to get any better.  Kick him out now before he tries to ruin your life as well.", "NTA. Not your kid. How does your mom figure you're selfish when she kicked him out?", "NTA.  \n\nIf he's gonna come in your home, criticize you for what you're wearing in your own home, make a mess of your home, and call you a selfish bitch for asking him to respect your home... he shouldn't be in your home.  That's not fair to you OR your fiance.  \n\nThe AH here is your mom- for not enforcing some decent behavior, and for kicking him out.  I don't know what country you're in, but here in the US it's considered child abandonment to kick him out at 16.  That's a crime.", "NTA, your younger brother's abusive behaviour is a direct result of your mom not enforcing boundaries with him. Providing him with a place to stay is NOT your obligation. \n\nIf you or your mom are worried about him you can always tell him to visit a youth shelter, though they probably won't let him stay either if he shows the same shitty attitude. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you've got a lot on your shoulders atm, I hope you get time to do self care & be there for yourself too.", "What the hell? NTA! I would\u2019ve kicked him out immediately if my brother ever did that- honestly wouldn\u2019t have even let him in if he\u2019s going to smoke and drink secretly. He sounds like a handful and more, he is your mother\u2019s problem to deal with- not you.\n\nIt is a awful situation, but he needs to realize how shitty he is in order to thrive in life, if he ever gets there. That is not your responsibility to help him on, especially if you are not wanting to do it whatsoever.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
