I told him I give him 1 month to find a job and he needs to sleep on the couch and he can only brings his clothes since we don't have place for the rest of his things and that in 1 year I want him gone. \n\nHe told me I can't kick him out or force him to do anything especially when he needs to sleep on the couch, like he said \"like a dirty dog\" and then he called our mom who is for stupid reasons on his side and she started calling me a selfish b*tch. \n\nI think I might be the AH for potentially kicking him out since he is my brother but I'm not his caretaker or legal guardian, I don't have time, energy or money to deal with him.", "created_utc": 1668044134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr1shf/aita_for_not_letting_my_brother_permanently_stay/", "score": 936, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless laws have changed, I dont think that is quite accurate.  \n\nEither way, get some solid legal advice, one of those free consults or a Legal Aid/Citizens Advice, someone who can tell you where everyone stands and what your options are.\n\nI strongly recommend you do not take your brother in for any length of time as you do not have the room, he is already causing problems and then you have to deal with a guilt of kicking him out.\n\nGood luck to you cherie", "I'll take it that you're in the UK then?", "and when he tells the cops that his mother forced him from the home and onto the streets they can go straight to her house and arrest her for child abandonment.  Mom goes to jail, brother goes to foster care (more likely a juvenile group home though) and sis gets to go on with her life unencumbered by annoying family.  Win/Win I suppose.", "I'm not, but I went on the official site of my gouvernement and it's 16 but he can still go in forster care until 18 and thank you!", "This makes no sense considering you are replying to two comments by OP that it is legal to kick out a kid his age.", "Do you mind sharing what country you reside in? \nI find it very odd that he can be kicked out at 16, but is still a juvenile who can be taken into foster care.", "NTA!\n\nAlmost immediately, after we got married the niece and nephew started \"stopping by\" on the regular. Nephew was 16 and had a slew of legal issues. Husband asked if \"we\" could take him in. \n\nI said, \"I am *not* like your mother and I refuse to take responsibility for all the dysfunctional kids in your family! I've raised my kid and I'm done.\"\n\nYou're only 18 and don't need this crap of trying to raise a disrespectful delinquent. It's Mom's job, not yours! Send him back to your mother. \n\nYour brother and mother are assholes. They can deal with each other. \n\nPut your foot down, OP. If you cave, it's gonna be a world of heart-ache and your life will be miserable. I guarantee it.", "NTA throw him out right now if that's his attitude when he hasn't even moved in. He is already shaming and verbally abusing you? He for sure is going stash your place, steal something, or worse hit you.", "NTA, and you should kick him out now and force him to go to your mom\u2019s house (how ironic that she kicked him out and is on his side). He\u2019s not gonna get better. If he\u2019s THIS entitled now, just ima go be what he\u2019ll be like in a few months. Most people at least pretend to be grateful and behave the first few days.", "NTA. It is not your job to parent your brother.

Grow a spine and kick him out.", "NTA, but you would be to yourself if you let your brother stay with you.  Since your mother is so concerned, he gets to go back to her.  Cut her off from your phone so you don't get caught up in their drama.  Tell him he needs to leave NOW.  Don't delay the inevitable.", "NTA \n\nSend him back to your mom\u2019s house!", "NTA\n\nCall your mom and tell her to pick him up. If she says no, inform her that if she doesn't your next call will be to CPS for child abandonment.\n\nGive her an hour or two, then do it.", "> then he called our mom who is for stupid reasons on his side and she started calling me a selfish b\\*tch.\n\nThe reason she is on his side is because she literally just kicked him out and does not want him to live with her.  She is not a selfish bitch for kicking out her own son, but you are for laying down ground rules.  \n\nHonestly you should just kick him out now because this situation will not be good with him saying things like:\n\n>He told me I can't kick him out or force him to do anything\n\nHe does not respect you or your home.  He dropped out of HS, and wants to sit around drinking and smoking.  He is not going to have a good life and your mom failed him as a parent, but it is not your job to look after him now.\n\nNTA.", "Kick him out now. He just got there and is already mooching.\n\nYour mom is on his side because she doesn't want him to come back home.\n\nNTA", "He's already shown he has ZERO  respect  for you.

The audacity of her calling you selfish is incredible. \nYou need to take care of yourself first.", "NTA. Not only is he not your responsibility, he\u2019s still a minor, so it\u2019s illegal that his mom kicked him out. That\u2019s child abandonment and it\u2019s illegal.

Kick him out.", "My brother was supremely pissed when I left home at 17.\n\nMoved back at 24 and my parents just dumped him on me, again. \n\nYou wouldn't believe how many people don't want to raise their own kids.

I have no idea how it works", "It's 7$ to stay, it's in the foster care system so that's why its not too expensive and they have task to do like dishes, cleaning and all of that, it's my friend who told me that place since he was in there for a year", "Ok, he isn't even your kid so kick him out. Then block his number and mom's. \n\nYour brother is not going to lift a finger or get a job or do anything at all. Hell, he insulted your clothing less the first day.

I don't know if that work too in my province", "Complain about what? You can call and state your mother kicked him out at 16. You can also state he does not have a place to stay, and you are unable to house him. Either your mom can take him back (which she is legally obligated to do unless your brother wants to leave willingly), or he could potentially be placed in foster care if no other immediate family can take him. \nIf neither of those options work, you or him can call the Kids Help line for a list of resources in your province."]}
