At the conclusion of the work, her contractor stacked the leftover bricks (a couple of hundred) against my back fence. I noticed at the time but thought he did it because they were moving materials and equipment in and out of her gate. Well, the job ended but the bricks stayed.  After a month or so, I asked my neighbor to move the bricks and instead she gave me her contractors cell number. Weird, but OK. So, I texted him and asked him to remove the bricks. Six months passed with me texting every couple of weeks, asking that the bricks be removed or moved to my neighbors property. Finally, I got annoyed, put a \u201cfree bricks\u201d ad on Facebook marketplace and within 24 hours the bricks were gone.   That was a couple of weeks ago, but this morning the contractor knocked on my door asking what happened to the bricks. I told them I gave them away after he abandoned them on my property.  He demanded that I pay him, and neighbor is backing him up.  I told him, \u201cno way, I ought to charge you for storage.\u201d So, Reddit, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1679783608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1221o2s/aita_for_giving_away_bricks/", "score": 130, "replies": ["NTA but the correct response would have been \"What bricks?\"\n\nIf they can pretend they didn't exist, so could you.", "NTA.

Might be worth checking the specific number of days, I think it's 30 but this may vary area by area so always worth looking into.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You made a good faith effort to get them removed.\n\nAlso, if I had work done in my yard and the contractor left a mess in my neighbor's yard, I would feel 100% responsible for getting that mess taken care of, whether I took care of it myself or got the contractor to do it.\n\nYour neighbor is AH #1, and the contractor is AH #2.", "NTA.

Making YOU chase down the contractor instead of doing it themselves is a real fucking asshole move.", "NTA Abandoned on your property, he failed to move them for **6 months** despite repeated requests. No way should you pay for them.", "NTA. He was using your yard for free storage, hopefully he learned a lesson.", "Hopefully you have a few photos as well.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth their time to sue you in small claims court, but it\u2019d be good if you have visual proof", "NTA; you contacted him several times over several months. \n\nThe contractor can get the money from your neighbour, who is who truly owes the contractor the money. But obviously your neighbour doesn't want to pay the contractor for that loss, which is why your neighbour is agreeing with the contractor.", "NTA. Don't know what the law says but you gave plenty of time to your neighbor and contractor to retrieve them.", "Hey,I watch Judge Judy. Those bricks were abandoned. You had the right to get rid of them\nNTA", "NTA First they put those bricks on your property without your consent. Then both your neighbor and contractor refused to take responsibility for them leaving them abandoned. Now that you got rid of them they expect you to pay? Tell them h*** no!

NTA, though you could have tipped them off on what you were going to do.\n\nIf it's on her property and just touching your back gate? YTA", "NTA", "They were abandoned on your property presenting a trip and navigation risk to you. They\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t sue.

You did what you had to do.  You gave so many chances.  Your neighbor is especially the asshole for refusing to get involved when she was the one who hired the contractor.\n\nBut I wouldnt have fessed up to it.   I would have played dumb.  \"You left unsecured materials out in the open and then come to me when they get stolen?  Sorry I cant help you\"", "NTA. Six months is plenty of notice.", "NTA", "You should have shown him some very nice bricks in your basement. Right next to a cask\u2026wait. Wrong story. My bad. \n\nNTA.  You have messages.

I waited 3 more weeks and went the marketplace route.", "Thank you. When she told me to deal with her contractor, I thought WTF, why is this on me?", "Yes, I have them all saved, just in case.", "The even weirder thing was that the contractor told me that some third party was supposed to pick them up and he tried to give me that guy\u2019s number, suggesting I should hound him instead.", "Yes, I took some pics just in case.", "No, they were fully on my property stacked on both sides of my gate. I spent 6 months maneuvering my garbage cans and bike around the bricks and got fed up.", "What's missing?", "You gave him many warnings, it\u2019s his fault that he ignored them and didn\u2019t do anything about it.", "This might tip the scales for some people. It should definitely have been in the original explanation.", "This never should have been put on your property to begin with. Much less left for 6 months. You are fully in the right from a moral perspective. It\u2019s definitely not your job to coordinate with a random other person and frankly shouldn\u2019t have been your job to text the contractor. Your neighbor and the contractor are both way out of line.", "Who\u2019s property were they on? I know they were against your fence, but were they on your neighbor\u2019s property?", "How did they get the bricks on your side?", "NTA. A tiny bit of... \"you should have told them you were giving them away\" but on the other hand 6 months of inconvenience and bullshit fuckery like that? \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "The bricks. /s", "The explanation of how the contractor hauled all of these bricks next door and stacked them in OP's back yard, and everybody involved thought that was okay.\n\nMy bet is that this was the back fence \"neighbor\", the bricks were stacked on the neighbor's side, and OP is playing property line fuck-fuck games.", "The 6 + months wasn\u2019t long enough?", "My property.", "Right? I'm trying to understand that too", " Yeah, I considered that, but his standard response was, I\u2019ll take care of it next week. Every. Single.Time. So, I thought, enough already, this guy is just stringing me along.", "Ha!  :)", "This is quite an assumption, based on... thinking this is an unrealistically AH move, so it's not believable?\n\nIf OP gave away bricks that were in the neighbor's yard, that would be pretty unbelievable, too.\n\nI'm not sure why you would feel confident enough to assume OP is a liar when, all things being equal, either scenario seems as (un)likely as the other to me, and the only \"evidence\" we have of the whole situation is OP's story.\n\nI mean... what kind of satisfaction would somebody get from posting an AITA when he knew he was blatantly lying about the central issue? What kind of sad, screwed up person would find any reward in that? I hate to think.", "Not true.  The only property line Involved was between my fence and a common area.  I leve in a townhouse development in a large city. The Bricks were not adjacent to my neighbor\u2018s property at all. That was what made the situation so maddening.", "My brother in christ, people troll AITA all the time. You think this story is real? Explain to me your real world scenario where a contractor hauls a ton of bricks onto someone else's property like it's no thing.", "And that is what makes the situation seem like such bullshit.\n\nYour clarification about living in a townhouse development doesn't actually clarify anything.", "A contractor that gets lazy after completing the part of the job they\u2019ll be paid for? My brother in hiring contractors, once the check has cleared you wouldn\u2019t believe the shit that gets left incomplete.", "We had it happen to us, once. \n\nMy neighbour had a new fence put in and, instead of stacking the surplus wood in their garden, it got left in ours. On our side of the fence. For no discernible reason.", "I don\u2019t know what you are talking about. The houses sit next to each other. The fence in question runs along the back of our yards, parallel to the street that our front doors face.  The bricks were against my back fence.  They weren\u2019t adjacent  to my neighbor\u2019s property, nor did they lie between my our house.  Other neighbors asked me to move the bricks because the blocked THEIR access to the alley as well, and I had to explain that they weren\u2019t mien. Geez.", "This, so many times, this. Never, I mean ***NEVER***, provide final payment until the work is done 100%. Withold a minimum of 10% until they are done, and, as with many things, they are not done until you are ... satisfied.", "Right. The contractor just walked a ton of bricks across a property line without any consultation with the owner of the other property. Go ahead and pull the other one. It's got YTA on.", "I\u2019ve not done the 10% thing, that\u2019s great advice. I still have loose electrical outlets in my basement remodel because the drywall guy called things *good enough*. He promised to come back \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah, I think I know who is the asshole in the convo.  There is a narrow Walkway that is parallel to the back fence that offers the only access to the alley through which materials had to be brought.  It is also the only access to our back gates. So, I understood the need to stack materials against my fence while work was going on. It is part of city living to be flexible. The problem (again) was leaving the bricks after the construction ended\u2014 for six months.  How strange that no one else has diffuculy understanding the situation,", "Good luck.", "Imagine not explaining all of that up front. I stand by my judgement. Next time try telling people what's actually going on.", "Imagine asking questions instead of leaping to judgment. I would truly hate to be you.", "NTA\nI'd have gotren rid of them earlier", "The law is clear.  See: Finders vs. Keepers", "Have you\u2026met a contractor before?", "Thats not the case name but its close its Finders and Keepers vs Losers and Weepers.", "lawyer in the house"]}
