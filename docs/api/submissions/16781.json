Does your daughter have problems with her weight? Is she obese? Fat is being overly demonized however cutting down fat consumption is one of the easiest ways to decrease your daily caloric intake and therefore most effective for weight loss. Though sometimes people go overboard with it and completely cut fats out of their lives. Usually if the 150g-180g steak is 75-80% lean and 20-25% fat, it's perfectly fine to eat it all as part of your dinner.

A parent to a child that is still a teenager has a duty to say \"no\" and to make it a point to teach healthy vs unhealthy food. And, if the child doesn't listen, it forces the parent to have to be even more strict. It would be neglect (a form of abuse) to not teach a child bout healthy eating and to ignore a child that is choosing an unhealthy diet.", "But our knowledge of nutritional science is sooo limited. Like if you actually look into it so many beliefs we hold come from very poorly done but we\u2019ll publicized studies and companies spreading \u201cinformation\u201d that helps them make a profit. Also weight is a very poor determinant of health, you need tests to actually see how healthy somebody is physically. \n\nAnd ignoring all of that, if we\u2019re rolling with the general consensus of nutritional guidelines, then red meat is something that somebody should be eating rarely, and if you\u2019ve eaten a whole steak is a strip of fat realistically going to make a huge difference? I\u2019m saying all of this because studies have shown that fat shaming like this reduces the likelihood of somebody actually having successful weight loss. So this behavior doesn\u2019t actually serve to help their child, but rather reinforce negative beliefs they might have about their body.", "So, you are saying that parents should never give any indication to their children that eating straight up strips of fat is unhealthy and eating fast food all the time is unhealthy? That's insane and I will never agree to that. Whether the child is obese or not, it is unhealthy to eat like that and saying that it might be upsetting to hear is not a healthy way to go about interacting with the world. You can't ignore unhealthy behavior in your kids for fear of upsetting them. A parent is also responsible for providing love and support. What if a child loves to abuse Adderall. Telling them it is unhealthy to take more than recommend may upset them and make the child self conscious. But it is still important to talk to a kid about it. Makes no sense to ignore unhealthy behavior based on fear of upsetting the child.", "NAH. Fat is fine in moderation, and sometimes the best part of a steak, or at the very least, most flavorful.

One chunk of beef fat won\u2019t make or break her overall dietary habits", "NTA - it was on your plate so it\u2019s yours to do with what you wish. But also, just eating a piece of fat? Eww. No. Not for me thanks.", "My mom grew up during the Depression and she would always eat the fat we cut off and left on our plates. Not my thing, but hey, she lived to be 97, so I don't think it hurt her too much.", "YTA Of all the things that would make your daughter fat, eating a bit of animal fat in its natural form would be the least of the causes. The processed, high carb snacks and fast food your daughter eats are doing far more metabolic damage than fat from regular meat ever could. If you check out the Keto forums on Reddit, you will see that many people eat high fat foods with no ill health effects when combined with non-processed foods and vegetables. If you are really worried about your daughter's health, work with her to cut out the junk food.", "NTA. As her parent you did the right thing. Just because she wants it or thinks it\u2019ll taste good doesn\u2019t mean she should eat it. She probably doesn\u2019t realize how sick that would make her. You gave her a small piece. She should be happy with that because most parents probably wouldn\u2019t even do that. Definitely not shaming you either. Kudos for compromising. Hopefully one day she\u2019ll realize you\u2019re just looking out for her and her health. I mean personally I\u2019d prefer to eat raw cookie dough over cookies because who doesn\u2019t love it raw but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to sit down and eat 4-5 raw cookies. Maybe not the best example because some raw cookie doughs are edible but you get what I\u2019m saying.", "YTA. As long as you do not feed her animal fats every single day, it will be fine. And yes, you were wasting good food.", "There is nothing wrong with eating a piece of animal fat. YTA", "Unpopular, but YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s being ridiculous, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it\u2019s not up to you to police a 16 year olds eating. If she wants to eat an extra piece of fat, she can. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be disgusting and probably make her feel like shit, and she\u2019ll learn a lesson. She\u2019s probably in the \u201clet\u2019s save the world\u201d phase most 16 year olds go through and cares deeply about food waste. If this is how she goes about it, then let her. \n\nShe\u2019s 16, at some point you need to cut the chord and let her make her own choices regarding what she puts in her body. Eating extra fat won\u2019t kill her or make her heart explode, but policing what she eats can absolutely cause damage. She\u2019s not 6 and she needs to start making these really dumb choices on her own.", "YTA.\n\nYou are going to give this child a bad relationship with food if you continue to police her diet like this. There are so many ways to keep your child healthy, and a balanced diet is ONE way of achieving that. I\u2019m sure that eating one piece of delicious fat isn\u2019t the huge deal you make it out to be.\n\n100% team daughter here.", "You do know that fat actually helps you break down vitamins in meat and other foods right? \n\nYou're more likely to get better results by replacing any artificial sugar that she intakes rather than her fat intake from meat. \n\nYour nutrition advice is outdated and you should seek a nutritionist if you're that worried about her weight. This was a stupid fight to have with your daughter and you need to pick your battles. \n\nYTA", "You are squeaking by with a NTA here because as a parent you have the right to make your kids eat healthier, and because eating a chunk of beef fat is repulsive so I have a hard time sympathizing with your daughter lol.\n\nThat said, you are probably not actually helping her in any meaningful way. When she realizes her weight was a factor here, she's not going to say \"oh gee, dad, sorry I didn't realize how great you were being before!\" Talking to your daughter about her eating habits in general and how that will impact her health longterm is the right move here. \n\nHell, I'll give you some anecdotal evidence to start you off-- I started gaining weight steadily in college, and I now hover just below obesity. (For reference, I'm a size 12, so technically still below average for an American woman. You don't have to be morbidly obese to feel the impacts.) It sucks, okay. I would pay a lot of money to be able to go back and tell my younger self to prioritize fruits and vegetables and reasonable moderation instead of enjoying the all-you-can-eat nature of college dining halls. \n\nIt's uncomfortable being fat-ish. It limits my mobility because the squishy parts get in the way when I try to sit or lie or move certain ways. It increases the wear on my joints. I personally also got way out of shape at the same time and having the extra weight makes it harder to get active again. It's also much harder for me to moderate my appetite than it was before, and I crave sweets constantly. The best way to manage your weight, your diet, and your health is never to let it get to a bad point.\n\nEating the fat may seem like a small thing, but it's a symptom of a larger pattern of not consuming unhealthy foods in moderation. Fat makes stuff taste good, so using a small amount to cook with or to help flavor lean meat is totally fine. You were right, OP, that eating a little piece of it was the healthy thing to do. The problem is that your daughter needs to understand and internalize that, and she clearly hasn't. Your action felt punitive rather than educational. I'm not sure how to solve that, but I wish you and her the best of luck.", "There are very few overweight people who have become thinner as a result of a family member restricting what they ate.  Calling something \"unhealthy\" to eat is creating even more issues around food.\n\nYTA.  You may think it's revolting, but she didn't.", "NTA, if it was on your plate, you can do whatever you want with it. Eating a huge piece of pure beef fat can make your stomach upset. \n\nYou can nibble on small pieces of it, in moderation.", "EEWW!! NTA!! That's disgusting!", "NTA - As a parent, you're responsible for your child's nutritional needs. There's no positive nutritional benefit in giving them a huge chunk of high cholesterol fat.", "NTA- tell her eating a large hunk of fat like that can give her diarrhea.  Which is true. \n\nTell her someday she can buy and eat all the fat she wants.  But it's not someday.\n\nIf she is concerned about food waste, then show her what REAL food waste is.  Its horrible.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand how anyone can eat that. I can\u2019t stand eating fat and take great care to cut it off steak beforehand. That said, no judgment to those who eat it. But daughter did not eat to eat a piece of fat that big. And it came from your plate. Had it been off daughters plate, I would say different.

You come off as a controlling parent, not an advocate like you're pretending to be. Also how often are you all having giant steaks? Because in my house growing up that was a rare event, so if someone would have wanted the piece of fat they could absolutely have it. \nYTA", "lol im jamaican, we love to chicken bone and it\u2019s quite nutritious", "It\u2019s not always inedible - there\u2019s the unchewable clear, plastic looking part that I think of as gristle and then there is the gooey, quite frankly yummy part that hasn\u2019t fully melted that gives flavor to the steak. Personally would have cut it up with pieces of meat to eat to add moisture/flavor (love that on prime rib for example) so It\u2019s not nuts IMO that she wanted to eat it it, but it was also on OPs plate and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s messed up to say no. Especially when there is no meat left and she already had her own meal.\n\nThe fact that she got upset over the potential food waste makes me wonder if the kid is doing ok or struggling with something. Seems a bit much for the situation.", "I think it\u2019s probably less about wasting food and more about she wanted to eat it.  Wonder if she worries about wasting other food like broccoli.", "Gasp!    Heresey!      Cut it off after you cook, you need it to cook!", "Thanks for the tip I think that comparison would help her understand", "Uh how is the daughter \u201cbullying\u201d OP?", "I mentioned this in a previous comment. Sugar intake has way more of an impact on weight than fat does. In fact fat often helps break down vitamins and other foods that are bodies normally wouldn't be able to absorb. \n\nIf op is that worried about his daughter's weight then he needs to go to a nutritionist and get some actual advice. Maybe even take the daughter with him so she can ask questions too. \n\nPolicing her food choices can lead to an eating disorder, educating her about the food she's eating may change her mind and make her take a different approach.", "It just seems unnecessary to eat a giant piece of pure fat", "The rest of the steak has significant nutritional value (protein). The giant fatty piece does not.", "She is definitely overweight, I just didn't want to make that a big point in my post since I plan on showing it to her and I don't want to shame her.", "16, says so in post", "there's a direction correlation between unhealthy eating and stress. i used to just eat any junk i could get my hands on and i only got that under control once i started taking my antidepressants again. (i have two anxiety disorders and one diagnosed depressive disorder). Once my cortisol levels went down my stress eating just disappeared. \n\ni could eat several bags of chips, and on some level i probably still can but i don't really want to, i don't have cravings anymore. anyway, i think having a genuine discussion about your daughter's mental health can do no harm and perhaps putting counselling or therapy on the table for her can be something can help her.\n\ni'm not saying she's unwell mentally but a lot of people treat weight issues as just bad habits which it can be but there's a lot of research that shows a direct correlation between weight and stress/mental health issues.\n\nAnyway NAH. Your just trying to be a good parent.", "Have you considered taking her to a specialist? Like a dietitian or a therapist that specializes in disordered eating? I worked with kids for years, specifically those who have mental illness, and this does sound like it could be the beginning of disordered eating habits.", "Yeah I disagree that beef fat is \u201cobviously inedible\u201d. People here are comparing it to something toxic that will make her physically ill. If she eats it and does happen to feel icky, then maybe a lesson for next time.

For example, my family is Scandinavian. When we cook a fresh ham you score the fat into squares, cut it off the cooked roast, and then serve it as a side.

I admit that it would look gross if you're not used to eating it though.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever too late to try and teach - it just becomes harder to implement", "i agree!! it\u2019s completely inedible to me, but i have no fear of it poisoning or causing me illness due to anything other than the puke worthy texture.", "Aye I just don't think you can go out and buy animal products where you don't even use half of it, then question if you've been wasteful or not. Buy leaner cuts of meat, repurpose the fat etc. The question of waste shouldn't ever have made it to the dinner table. \n\nNever bought a steak with to much fat, havent had to trim a steak the entire time ive been cooking. If you're buying a steak where half the volume of the steak is fat then you've been wasteful in your purchase if not eating or using it. The only time I've ever had a steak with to much fat to eat alone would be buying a picanha cut, where lots of the rendered fat left over gets used for the rest of the meal, frying tacos with etc.", "Fat on a prime rib? \n\nExcellent.", "For me it's the crispy strip down the side of a New York striploin. The bits of steak from that side with the fat attached are delicious. Terrible for you, but so good. Cutting that strip off and eating it by itself doesn't sound appealing, though.", "Agreed. Ukrainian Salo is literally chunks of salted pork fat and it\u2019s considered a delicacy. I absolutely love it. Obviously you don\u2019t eat it like an apple, you slice small pieces off but it\u2019s still pure fat that is considered good to eat", "Even buying the steak is wasteful if not going to use the fat in other cooking if it's really such an obnoxious amount of fat left on the steak after rendering the fat. It shouldn't even be a case of wasting it at the dinner table as you should be able to get cuts that suit you and not have waste in the first place. \n\nI don't think there is a way to ever truly eat animal products that is ethical, you can always at least buy products where you're going to make the most use of them though. At least that's how I was taught. \n\nHaven't bought a steak with to much fat in any memory I can recall because there are so many options. But I'd at least repurpose it if I'd ended up with such an amount. Did come from an animal and should be fully utilised or other options bought and I dont think its wrong to call it wasteful. Even if health reasons and a kid being greedy on portions is an issue it isn't that hard to just buy the food you'll actually all consume.", "Like you said before, fat isn't the unhealthy thing in general, sugar is. Monitoring sugar is way more important imo. That said she still shouldn't eat so much unhealthy fats and carbs, like fast food, snacks or fat from a steak.", "It is completely untrue that all saturated fats are man made and natural fats aren\u2019t saturated. A lot of animal fats are saturated. Coconut oil is largely saturated fat. Trans fats are generally man made but those are unsaturated.", "[deleted]", "This is hilarious. How are \u201csweets\u201d considered fat? Sugar is a carbohydrate. I\u2019m not going to argue about who is more \u201cqualified\u201d. I have a nutrition degree but that\u2019s neither here nor there. Fried foods are just foods that are deep fried in some sort of fat/oil, it has nothing to do with whether the oil was \u201cnatural\u201d or made in a lab. Cheese and butter are made using fat from an animal, which is usually considered \u201cnatural\u201d because they aren\u2019t man made. They\u2019re produced by the animal itself. The fat molecules were saturated when they were produced by the animal, and they remain saturated in the cheese/butter", "That\u2019s the dumbest argument I have heard in years", "Lmao no that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all. If I\u2019m going into that territory then I think parents need to teach intuitive eating and to rely on their bodies knowing what they need and how they are feeling and adapt their behavior accordingly. I personally believe the evolution of humanity is so far spread and complex that it\u2019s ridiculous to believe that we all should live by the same guidelines. in regards to the fast food thing, what\u2019s the fast food? There are a ton of ways to eat nutritionally beneficial food from fast food places. \n\nI think using a blanket idea that fat is an bad food or an unhealthy food isn\u2019t as well backed by data as we might think and maybe OP\u2019s daughter actually did want that fat. If she did actively want the fat instead of not wanting to waste it then then question is why? Is she not getting enough fat in her diet, or certain vitamins that are common in fatty foods? \n\nLike it\u2019s all so complex and im sure absolutely nobody paid attention but I never actually made a judgment. I don\u2019t think this is an AITA situation, but if I were to say NAH. OP and daughter are trying to get through life with the information they have in the bodies that they exist in, and I don\u2019t think either of them have ill intent. But by and all, my point was, if your goal is to get somebody to lose weight, telling them they can\u2019t eat certain foods (regardless of age) is not going to help you achieve that goal. It\u2019s just not. You can be upset about all you want; I too would love for shit to work out like that. But recent history and studies have shown that thats not how it works and therefor we need to adjust our approach"]}
