Does your daughter have problems with her weight? Is she obese? Fat is being overly demonized however cutting down fat consumption is one of the easiest ways to decrease your daily caloric intake and therefore most effective for weight loss. Though sometimes people go overboard with it and completely cut fats out of their lives. Usually if the 150g-180g steak is 75-80% lean and 20-25% fat, it's perfectly fine to eat it all as part of your dinner.

A parent to a child that is still a teenager has a duty to say \"no\" and to make it a point to teach healthy vs unhealthy food. And, if the child doesn't listen, it forces the parent to have to be even more strict.

Like if you actually look into it so many beliefs we hold come from very poorly done but we\u2019ll publicized studies and companies spreading \u201cinformation\u201d that helps them make a profit. Also weight is a very poor determinant of health, you need tests to actually see how healthy somebody is physically. \n\nAnd ignoring all of that, if we\u2019re rolling with the general consensus of nutritional guidelines, then red meat is something that somebody should be eating rarely, and if you\u2019ve eaten a whole steak is a strip of fat realistically going to make a huge difference? I\u2019m saying all of this because studies have shown that fat shaming like this reduces the likelihood of somebody actually having successful weight loss. So this behavior doesn\u2019t actually serve to help their child, but rather reinforce negative beliefs they might have about their body.", "So, you are saying that parents should never give any indication to their children that eating straight up strips of fat is unhealthy and eating fast food all the time is unhealthy? That's insane and I will never agree to that. Whether the child is obese or not, it is unhealthy to eat like that and saying that it might be upsetting to hear is not a healthy way to go about interacting with the world. You can't ignore unhealthy behavior in your kids for fear of upsetting them. A parent is also responsible for providing love and support. What if a child loves to abuse Adderall. Telling them it is unhealthy to take more than recommend may upset them and make the child self conscious. But it is still important to talk to a kid about it. Makes no sense to ignore unhealthy behavior based on fear of upsetting the child.", "NAH. Fat is fine in moderation, and sometimes the best part of a steak, or at the very least, most flavorful.

However, I will say at age 16, there should be some degree of independence in making her own choices. The fat is edible, and I used to love eating the fat as a teen.

At the same time, my mom telling me how unhealthy it was and actively trying to prevent me from eating stuff like that went in one ear and out the other. \n\nOnly at age 28 have I discovered for myself what is good nutrition, and it really has made all the difference for me. You can present her with the facts\u2014animal fat is extremely calorie dense and isn\u2019t a helpful thing to eat if your goal is to lose weight. It\u2019s honestly really important though not to label legitimate foods as bad or good, even something as small as fat on a steak. I never struggled with my weight until a few years ago and then realized what an incredibly unhealthy relationship I had with food to the point of yo-yo-ing between underrating and binge eating. What actually repaired my relationship with food was tracking macros and eating in a calorie deficit to lose fat. \n\nSo basically I was tracking calories but with an emphasis on meeting a certain daily protein goal alongside lifting weights so as not to lose muscle mass. The important thing was that rather than loosely tracking I was actually weighing all of my portions on a gram scale and being as precise as possible so that I *truly* knew how many calories I was eating on a daily basis. It took some effort but was not as time-intensive as it seemed. I mostly eat the same things on rotation throughout the week, so once I had created a log for that food in my nutrition app, all I had to do was quickly weigh it and log the weight which took 5 seconds. It really opened my eyes to how calorie-dense normal everyday foods are and how I was giving my body way more calories than it needed. It was also kind of a fun game to see how much food I could fit into my day without going over my calories, and of course this naturally led me to making much healthier choices, since lower calorie foods tend to be things like lean meats, legumes, rice, and LOTS of veggies and fruits. However, I was still able to eat desserts and treats on a nearly daily basis, just in smaller quantities. Once I lost the weight I wanted to lose, I stopped tracking but retained all that I had learned about food. \n\nI honestly have such a healthy relationship now with eating and also with my body image because of this (and also because of my new-found love for lifting weights!). Tracking macros can sound really neurotic and intense, but it should only be a temporary thing, simply to teach you good choices that become habits that stay with you even after you\u2019re no longer tracking, and for most people (unless you have struggled with an intense eating disorder) it really teaches you that food is not good or bad\u2014food is neutral. Some foods are more *helpful* for your body, but it is still possible and it is good to continue eating the junk and desserts, just in quantities that are right and helpful for your body. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your daughter should track her calories, but simply if you can reframe yours and her mentality surrounding food, it might be helpful.

Even if it is your daughter, not letting her have a half more of a helping at dinner and doing it under the guise of \"I'm trying to make sure you eat healthily\" is inadvertently causing some damage. Why buy the fatty steak if you were trying to encourage healthy eating? Why not buy a leaner cut of meat, or buy chicken cutlets instead? After reading the edits, you really want to tread carefully when trying to get your daughter to change her eating habits. There is a HUGE difference between subtle encouragement and straight-up policing her food intake under the guise of parental responsibility. Stop labeling foods as \"good\" and \"bad\" especially in front of younger kids. It's very easy to foster an unhealthy relationship with food, whether it be eating too little or too much! \n\nI say this because I was the teen girl who ate like shit every day in my last two years of HS (I blame my school for allowing Juniors and Seniors to get off-campus lunch LOL). It wasn't until the end of my first year of college when I gained the freshman 15 on top of the weight I gained in the latter half of high school, that I made the conscious decision to change my diet and put in the work. To this day, at 25 y/o I admit that the three years I spent torturing myself to lose those 40 lbs still haunt me. Despite the positive habits that I adopted, the toxic thoughts I have about food are still there. \n\n***That being said, here is my (slightly unsolicited) advice:***  \nIf it's to the point where the amount of food she's eating borders on \"binging,\" encourage fibrous snacks throughout the day (i.e. berries and nuts before dinner, protein smoothie in the mornings before school, oatmeal, yogurt with granola and honey, etc.) Because she's having complex carbs, her body will take its time digesting and breaking down the fiber-rich snack, she won't even be thinking about chips or soda or whatever. And even if she does continue to eat those processed snacks, at least she had some nutrient-rich foods throughout the day. Eventually, her tastes will change and she might even start craving whole foods instead of the processed stuff. I remember when I would eat a highly processed diet in college, I literally didn't have hunger cues. With these small changes, she'll start to learn what her body wants and figure out when she's satiated.\n\n  \nJust remember that she's young and growing, food was a HUGE part of my life. It was how I connected with my friends. When everyone first got their license, we'd swing by Sonic or go to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory with large groups of people. Don't tarnish those core memories by encouraging her to worry about the type of food she's eating or how much! I long for the days when I didn't know what a calorie was or if that carb has a high glycemic index lmao. As long as you implement tiny changes every day - her relationship with food will change too. It's not up to you to bring your foot down and stop her from finishing off your plate, that WILL backfire. ESPECIALLY at 16.\n\nAlso, why is her weight gain worrisome to you? Think carefully about body image. Has your daughter expressed unhappiness about the way she looks?  If she has expressed concern about the weight gain and has come to a point where she HERSELF wants to change it, then absolutely start encouraging light exercise and teaching her about what she can do. Just make sure you do it kindly and without judgment! Her body doesn't HAVE to look a certain way, don't teach her that it does. With Instagram, TikTok, the Kardashians of the world, and the plastic surgery marketing campaigns being pushed onto children -- she gets enough of that at school and on her phone, she doesn't need her mom working against her too.\n\nThis comment may seem like overkill and OP may not even need this advice (I really just took your edit note and ran with it, note that I literally don't know OP or their daughter so I could have just made some wild assumptions), but with a post about 16 y/o girl's mother making comments on her food habits can be triggering for a lot of people! I want people who might be in the same position as OP's daughter to come across my comment and see that if they're unhappy with their diet (or are stuck in a constant loop of binge/restrict cycles), there is a way out of it. I'm here for you!", "NTA - Regarding what you choose to do with your food.  But FYI, steak fat isn't unhealthy per se.  Sure if you eat pounds of it it will add up, but eating the fat off of an average cut of steak is usually considered healthy (i.e. it's a healthy type of fat that is good for your body, as opposed to the fats you will eat in more processed food).", "YTA \n\nYou can cut pieces of steak fat up and put it on the fork  with the meat part of the steak for more flavor. \n\nIt will also fill her up more than most steam dinner sides will - such as bread or milk or any non-water drinks or potatoes or any side other than veggies. \n\nI highly doubt the steak fat is what\u2019s causing the issue with weight.

NTA>but there is context missing.\n2. Please, mother, do what you can to ensure your daughter has a healthy weight. As an educator, I see how cruel kids are to bigger kids. It also attacks their self-esteem and confidence which they need to boost at these young ages. When it comes to dating, feeling attractive, and being desirable, this is very important as she becomes more sexually aware. My mother put me on a diet at the age of 10, and the best thing she ever did. I needed my confidence and self-esteem so badly then and those were my building blocks for adulthood.   (I am now 50 and still very active and still turn heads from those half my age).  When you teach a kid to eat healthily, you are teaching this FOR LIFE.  I still eat mostly fruits and veggies, even today. \n3. How old is the daughter? If the daughter is a teenager, it will be harder to curb her eating habits.\n4.  Eating healthy is only half of a healthy living style.  The other half is physical activity (medium to high intensity) such as competitive sports, running, gymnastics, etc.  Yoga and Pilates are great for low activities but a kid who has higher energy needs to be taught to be active for life. Many girls stop doing sports and exercise between ages 13-16 never to do them again. (I do running, ball hockey, mountain climbing, and weight training). \n5. Is the mother teaching by example? Is mom's weight within normal range? Is she a physically active person?  By a parent showing these life skills to her daughter, the daughter is more than likely to adopt these healthy choices for life. \n\nNTA and I commend the mom for stepping in.

But kid\u2019s hungry. Play football/soccer with her. NAH", "We take the extra fat and cook it on low heat to render down the fat into oil. Depending on the quality we will either cook with it or use it to make fire starters for our outside firepit. \n\nI love that your kid wants to avoid being wasteful. But that doesn't always mean you need to eat every scrap. Perhaps consider starting a compost pile or worm composter at home. Make it a project she can partake in. This way extra food scraps and food waste can be turned into fertile compost to feed other plants in and around your home. \n\nNTA and I think this is a good learning opportunity to chat with your kid about food waste and the different ways to reduce it without risking ones arteries.", "NTA. You didn't waste food.", "I can agree with the plate, but let's not pretend steak fat is inedible lmao. It's what adds the delicious taste. Still, it being OP's plate makes it NTA. If it had been the daughter's plate, it would have been different.", "It wasn't a bit of fat though, it was a big chunk. That is definitely unhealthy. Also, I'm not sure keto forums on Reddit are the most reliable source of information.", "I want through a phase as a child/young teenager when I would vacuum up all the \u2018crisply rendered beef fat\u2019 (I love your phrasing-I was scrolling down looking for someone else who acknowledged it can be delicious) I could get. I\u2019d have been happy to eat nothing else\u2014it tasted like ambrosia to me at that time and I\u2019d literally beg it off anyone\u2019s plate where they\u2019d discreetly cut it off and set it aside. It wasn\u2019t remarked upon or shamed, maybe smiled at a little, and I passed through the phase and into more balanced eating habits. I do sometimes dart a little taste of crispy fat off a steak in remembrance of how amazing it tasted back then but it\u2019s just a normal amount of yummy now.", "Update us on what she says, if you don't mind", "How did he call her fat?? By refusing to give her a giant chunk of fat from his plate?", "I\u2019d be interested in what else is in the meal  - like what drinks are they having? What sides? Any simple carbs? \n\nBecause if it isn\u2019t veggies and water, then OP is looking at the wrong food to worry about.", "The fat is sometimes the best part of a steak", "The fat does give it flavor in the cooking process. I'll cut the fat off and may eat a small bite of it because it can taste good, but I wouldn't want to eat a huge slab of fat and I wouldn't want my kids to either.", "Not to say I have the best mental state(lol) but it\u2019s not because I like to eat the fat.  The fat and gristle (the latter of which is inedible) are two separate things. And I like it cause it\u2019s yummy. Maybe I like the soft chewy texture too, idk. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve felt needed to be analyzed.", "As an Asian.  Pork Belly is \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22.", "It is when it was not her food to begin with. \n\nIt\u2019s the parents steak , on the parents plate. They decide what to do with it. \n\nThe kid needs to grow up, she\u2019s soon an adult", "So by your quote of \"a balanced diet is ONE way of achieving \\[keeping your child healthy\\]\" which implies that a child can be healthy without a balanced diet in the long term, your solution to not making the problem worse is to let her blow up like a balloon before she reaches 20, am I reading you right?", "Agree...", "If I have a big chunk I just cut it into small pieces and eat a bit with each bite of steak.", "Ohhhh my god the crispy-fat bites are so fucking goood.", "We had this growing up as well and called it \u010dvarci (in the US but Croatian and Slovenian partial ancestry)!  It is definitely a guilty pleasure, though I believe it is fine as a special (not daily) treat in moderation.", "Any_coyote also edited the original comment that sparked this debate.  He or she initially used the term \u201cbullying\u201d twice.  Now one of those usages has magically disappeared and has been changed to manipulating.  Lol.", "They decided to throw it in the garbage.. seems immature no?", "Are you OPs daughter?", "Or parenting. My husband can be a bit like this, but that's because he got severe physical punishment for not eating everything given to him. I don't think he fully knows his own \"fullness\" meter even now in middle age, and he still feels compelled to be the family garbage dump, so to speak. When my kids and I are done, it's sometimes really hard for him not to clean our plates. Those learned neural pathways can take a LONG time to unlearn.", "It also seems deep seated in human nature from evolving before there was regular food supply, feast or faminen but today for non-poor people it's all feast", "You are correct that Oxford is a respected source.  My apologies there. But when doing any sort of research, you have to check more than one source and go with the preponderance of evidence. When 98% of credible sources have one definition, in this case the idea that bullying is repeated cruelty, it\u2019s silly to cherry pick from the 2% of definitions that don\u2019t discuss the repetitive nature of bullying just to attempt to prove your point. This is true regardless of the source you are cherry picking from. It\u2019s disingenuous to do so, and it actually weakens your argument.   \nLet me further point out that the majority of the definitions from respected sources also mention that bullying usually involves a power imbalance such as authority or physical size.  Kind of difficult for a minor child to have power over her father. This further weakens the notion that this is bullying. Anyway, choose to die on this hill all you want.  The downvotes you got for calling this bullying speak for themselves."]}
