His family is relatively hands off, and he's grown up with a lot of freedom make his own decisions with plenty of room to \"learn\" and make mistakes. My family on the other hand is fairly strict, and has a lot of high expectations when it comes to performance, decorum, and success. Our culture also places a heavy emphasis on respect, especially to our elders.\n\nTim and I are happy together, but our only point of major conflict is how he deals with my family. \n\nHere's the thing: my parents are super generous to my sibling's partners but not so much with Tim (one of my siblings also has a partner from the same culture as Tim, so I don't believe it's a race issue). Tim constantly complains and is offended that my parents don't spend as much money on him. \n\nI told Tim that I support him if he doesn't want to \"suck up to my parents\" (his words), but he shouldn't expect preferential treatment. But he says that gifts should be generously given, and fairly spread out if other partners are receiving them. I say that gifts from my parents aren't something we're entitled to. \n\nI'm especially frustrated because I feel like Tim doesn't have to do much to show respect to my parents. For example, we recently went to their home for dinner with my family, and I suggested that Tim bring some wine or fruit as a gift to show we were thankful for their hospitality (since my mother was cooking). He said that if they shouldn't invite people over if they expected a gift. My brother and sister's partners each brought something (one a cake, and the other some flowers), and I could tell my mother was touched and my father slightly irritated at Tim.\n\nTim says I'm an AH for not fighting for him more, and for trying to force him to conform to my family's values. I can kind of see where he's coming from, but I also know where my parents are coming from too. \n\nOh! And here's an example from Tim of their unfairness in case it helps with context: For each partner's birthdays, my parents take everyone out to dinner. For the other two we went to really high end and exclusive restaurants. For Tim, they still took us out and paid everything plus got Tim a gift, but his meal was less fancy (but still nice IMO.

It would be different if your parents were disrespecting him, because of his job,race etc. \n\nSince my IL brought to the the world someone special as my spouse, then they deserve same level of respect as my own parents and some small tokens of appreciation would never hurt.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re asking him to suck up, you are simply asking him to show respect for your family the same way you do.
