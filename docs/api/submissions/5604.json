Do what you can to let him know you are an adult he can turn to, have a shoulder to cry on, get hugs from, someone that is on his side forever and always.

Granted, the kids I've done with hasn't been bc of.mistreatment, just bc I want to make sure they have an adult they can turn to for the hard and scary things life can throw at them. They know they have someone they can contact at any time day or night, it doesn't matter ifni haven't seen or talked to them in 5 years, if they need me I'll do the best I can to help them. \n\nThis comes in the form of not only establishing a relationship with them, and letting them see I am on their side.

So they can find us if we have to be found. \n\nMy husband and I are getting ready to start the process to become foster parents. One of the things we have talked about and agreed on is to make sure that any kid we have in our care, regardless if it's 3 hours, 3 days, or 3 years, will always have someone they can turn to when they need it. Our ability to help them may be limited due to whatever is going on, but we can do the best we can and at least be on their side. We are going to set up a separate email and have even talked about possibly getting a separate cell phone just for this purpose. Write down all the info they would need to get in contact with us, and tell them to keep that little piece of paper safe and on them. So if they just need to talk, if they need to escape a bad situation, if they are scared, if they turn 18 and dk what to do whatever. We will do what we can to the best of our abilities (and what we legally can do). I am hoping this will be a good idea for any kid we foster.\n\nSomething I have learned is, sometimes the only thing we can do for those in need is let them know we are on their side and they have someone to talk to.

They  deserve to be unhappy and alone and I despise them.", "There\u2019s no way that Jack would be saying anything if he \u201chad a problem with it.\u201d  NTA", "Jack is so used to being ignored that he doesn't even react anymore. This is absolutely heartbreaking. You are NTA, and your family needed to be called the fuck out for treating him like garbage. Thank you for standing up for this poor child.", ">They\u2019re all upset with me now and insisted that they really didn\u2019t mean to ignore/exclude him\n\nBut they did, so what are they going to do to make amends and ensure it never happens again? \n\n>and that it\u2019s unfair for me to say these things.\n\nAs unfair as the same person being the only person denied hot chocolate, a cookie, *and* a seat at the dinner table? \n\n>They\u2019re saying I ruined the night\n\nBut they all got hot chocolate, cookies, and a family dinner, so... \n\n>and am overreacting and that if Jack has an issue he\u2019d say so.\n\nRight, because Jack *not* saying anything isn't *the* most alarming and concerning issue in this whole debacle. \n\n>The mood is still off and now idk if I\u2019m the AH or not because maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said anything considering it\u2019s Christmas and Jack doesn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nOf course Jack cares. Jack is a human being. You might want to check the rest of your family, however - they may have been replaced by pod people.\n\nNTA and stand your ground on this. Jack clearly needs someone - *anyone* - in his corner.", "NTA and good for you for sticking up for Jack.", "I'd take it further and buy every adult elf suits, sit them on a bench, take a picture, & label it my elves on a shelf for Jack. You and Jack can have that inside joke for the rest of your lives lol", "Not saying that's not true but jack is also a teenage boy apathy is his normal state.\n\nI think if this is the first time OP has ever noticed anything outside the normal then I would say she is potentially over reacting. ( Although getting him to eat in the kitchen on Christmas day is harsh)", "Agreed. One of these incidents would\u2019ve been considered an accident, but they did this the whole night. They didn\u2019t even offer any other options for him to feel included. This was all intentional. It seems like they\u2019re trying to direct their anger towards OP\u2019s sister onto Jack and make a point that they don\u2019t consider him part of the family. If I were OP, I would\u2019ve said much more than just calling them terrible. Poor Jack. NTA.", "I thought it was weird too that Jack was the one that was always last and forgotten. Plus, was there no way to fix it. Like could they not make more hot chocolate or split the cookies or something instead of just making someone go without. \n\nAnd I was appalled when they asked Jack to go eat in another room and on Christmas.  Like it\u2019s supposed to be a FAMILY dinner. Or are they saying that he is not part of the family? And then they say that if Jack had an issue he would say so, but would he really? If I was Jack and I had been excluded the entire night, I would probably feel like my family didn\u2019t care about me and I probably wouldn\u2019t think they would care if I spoke up and said something. Plus you wonder if Jack is treated like this a lot and if he is, then he is probably just used to having to put up with it and not saying anything. \n\nPlus it sounds like Jack was crying in his room alone so I\u2019m guessing it does bother him and he is upset.  And then when op says something the family says that op ruined Christmas?! It sounds like they ruined Christmas for Jack and they don\u2019t care. Like how would they feel if they were forgotten all night and then told to go eat by themselves? It would probably ruin Christmas for them. \n\nop, you are definitely nta. Please keep standing up for Jack, it sounds like he needs someone like you.", "The fact that you saw this in such a short period and that it was accepted as normal is appalling. Think what he must experience other times. YWBTA if you don\u2019t call the authorities to get Jack some help. You can also talk to Jack\u2019s school to get support for him. At best, your parents need support and guidance on how to raise Jack in healthy and supportive manner. Jack deserved to be valued, protected, and loved. He is being failed by those he is supposed to trust. Help him.", "Once is an accident.\n\nTwice can be coincidence.\n\nThree times? That's intent. In this case, looks like malicious intent.", "I think you gave it to them easy. I would have ended that with a shouting match. Not advocating it, but srsly", "Ok that could happened but why where not the adults not taking the hit? I have a large family, we are like 25 people with my siblings, partner and niblings. So sometimes we dont have enough for everyone but we have a large selection so everyone gets somethings. BUT children go before adults ALWAYS. \n\nFor seating we sometimes have to sit in different rooms if we have not rented a space, We basically sits on the floor, the elder ones get the chairs and small children. Nobody are sitting alone \n\nSomething is really wrong with your families treatment of Jack. \n\nI think Jake is use to be treated like this. Talk to him and make it clear he has you in his corner.", "I'm sorry you went through a shitty childhood. I guess welcome to the Club? We've got cookies!", "Exactly! Kids get it first and the adult can be without.", "Just don\u2019t miscount them \ud83c\udf6a", "I agree . I am 36. My mother would never eat before offering it to me. This is so sad!", "I have a hard time believing that the dad miscounted. When I hold events at my house I make a damn sure that I have more than what is needed. I will then send extra things home with people to send off to cousins or nieces or whatever. I have no idea how they could be miscounted like that", "No way any grownup in my family would be eating a cookie or drinking cocoa if there wasn\u2019t enough for the kids."]}
