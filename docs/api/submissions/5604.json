Do what you can to let him know you are an adult he can turn to, have a shoulder to cry on, get hugs from, someone that is on his side forever and always.

Granted, the kids I've done with hasn't been bc of.mistreatment, just bc I want to make sure they have an adult they can turn to for the hard and scary things life can throw at them. They know they have someone they can contact at any time day or night, it doesn't matter ifni haven't seen or talked to them in 5 years, if they need me I'll do the best I can to help them. \n\nThis comes in the form of not only establishing a relationship with them, and letting them see I am on their side.

So they can find us if we have to be found. \n\nMy husband and I are getting ready to start the process to become foster parents. One of the things we have talked about and agreed on is to make sure that any kid we have in our care, regardless if it's 3 hours, 3 days, or 3 years, will always have someone they can turn to when they need it. Our ability to help them may be limited due to whatever is going on, but we can do the best we can and at least be on their side. We are going to set up a separate email and have even talked about possibly getting a separate cell phone just for this purpose. Write down all the info they would need to get in contact with us, and tell them to keep that little piece of paper safe and on them. So if they just need to talk, if they need to escape a bad situation, if they are scared, if they turn 18 and dk what to do whatever. We will do what we can to the best of our abilities (and what we legally can do). I am hoping this will be a good idea for any kid we foster.\n\nSomething I have learned is, sometimes the only thing we can do for those in need is let them know we are on their side and they have someone to talk to.

Like it\u2019s supposed to be a FAMILY dinner. Or are they saying that he is not part of the family? And then they say that if Jack had an issue he would say so, but would he really? If I was Jack and I had been excluded the entire night, I would probably feel like my family didn\u2019t care about me and I probably wouldn\u2019t think they would care if I spoke up and said something.

And then when op says something the family says that op ruined Christmas?! It sounds like they ruined Christmas for Jack and they don\u2019t care.

My grandma saw I was about to say something and shook her head at me, so I just sat there.  When we left, I told them that I\u2019d never go back to that house and if they forced me to I would say something because my great aunt was absolutely wrong. \n\nAccording to my mom, her aunt has always been like that and neither of her cousins were ever given the opportunity to live their lives.
