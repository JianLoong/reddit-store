I offered to give him mine but he said he didn\u2019t want it. \n\nThen it was time for dinner and everyone went to sit at the table while Jack quickly went to use the washroom. I noticed that there were no empty seats but before I could say anything Jack entered the room and my mom said \u201cI don\u2019t think we have anymore space on the table... would you mind eating in the kitchen?\u201d \n\nHe didn\u2019t even reply and went to his room instead. No one really cared and didn\u2019t even blink at him going to bed after not eating all day. I felt really bad though. We didn\u2019t have any extra chairs but I\u2019m sure someone could\u2019ve thought of SOMETHING. I would\u2019ve even given him my own chair. I made him a plate and then went to go find him. I wouldn\u2019t say he was crying but when I entered his eyes were red insanely red and he looked incredibly sad. He was embarrassed but thanked me for the food. \n\nI left so as to not make him uncomfortable but I was so upset.\n\nMy nieces left to go do their own thing and my siblings+parents noticed that I was upset and asked me what was wrong. I just said \u201cyou\u2019re all so fucking terrible\u201d. \n\nThey all went silent but I continued and told them that idk if they were mistreating Jack on purpose but they\u2019d better be ashamed of themselves. \n\nThey\u2019re all upset with me now and insisted that they really didn\u2019t mean to ignore/exclude him and that it\u2019s unfair for me to say these things. They\u2019re saying I ruined the night and am overreacting and that if Jack has an issue he\u2019d say so.

He\u2019s so nonchalant about it because of that. Hearing about how his mother is unfit to care for Jack, I personally believe his grandparents are taking out their feelings on his mother on him. This isn\u2019t fair to him and they need to be ashamed of themselves. You are absolutely not the asshole for calling them out on that. They may not be completely aware of it but now that they are they need to change, or else that kid may go down the same path as his mom.", "Your sisters are in their 30s and Jack is 15, so I'm guessing your sister had him in her teens. Is that right? It seems like your parents are expressing their disappointment in your sister on Jack, and it's probably been happening his whole life. I have a large family too. We would never tell someone to eat in another room or \"forget\" or \"miscount.\" If it was a miscount, why was Jack always the last to be offered a treat?

Maybe you could have started the convo with them in a better way so that they would have been more receptive but it\u2019s hard when your emotions get the best of you.

But OP, now that you have seen Jack's reality; he is so used to this treatment and just sucks it up, but it tares him up in private, don't leave him to suffer alone. Please help him to see he is special.", "NTA. Jack seems indifferent to it probably because he\u2019s used to being treated like that. That doesn\u2019t make it okay. Good for you for standing up to them and letting them know that they\u2019re being terrible. Is there anything you can do with Jack or a small gift you could get him that would maybe help him not feel so left out?", "Jack is absolutely being neglected and he is so used to it shrugging his shoulders is the only way he has learned to deal with this situation. The way your parents not only looked at Jack first EVERYTIME someone needed to be excluded but also the way your entire family just brushed it off I feel so sorry for Jack. Yes everyone is mad at you, you pointed out to your parents how shitty they are to Jack while they have probably been patting themselves on the back for taking in their wayward teen daughter's offspring and raising him \"like their own\". Now you have busted that bubble and they are pissed that you made them take a real look in the mirror. Do you live close? is it possible to take in Jack? If not then it's time to be supper present in his life and revamp your relationship with Jack. Tell him how important he is to you. Next time he is being asked to be disregarded just split things with him even when he insists no. I am sure Jack is made to feel like an unwanted burden often and him saying \"no\" when you offered to share was a way for him to feel less like a burden.", "What in the actual fuck. NTA and of course he is upset. Ok ran out of hot chocolate not a huge deal and maybe he genuinely didn't care but a fucking adult should have given theirs up not a child I don't care if he's 15. Then there weren't enough cookies and the poor kid didn't have a seat at the fucking dinner table? Nobody, especially his parents, thought this was messed up. The poor kids heart was probably broken. Wow I want to hug the poor kid. You definitely did not overreact and your family is disgusting.", "NTA. Any chance you could take Jack in? Doesn't seem like anyone else in your family can be trusted and goddamn he deserves better than this.", "NTA your family is horrible. Have them read this post. They know how to count. They are emotionally abusing him. Is there anyone else who can take custody of Jack?", "NTA, you were right to call them out on it. They absolutely are doing this to Jack all the time and he knows not to fight. He's being mistreated. If you have the ability to take Jack in, do so.", "ESH. Any decent adult would\u2019ve stopped this at the hot chocolate by giving him their mug w/o asking.", "IKR. My heart is broken for Jack.", "Sounds like they are from Canada", "In my family we typically give the kids everything first. And 15 is still a child! (Even though so many of us feel we are grown at that age). That way if there was a miscount, the children are not left out. \n\nI\u2019m proud of you standing up for Jack. Maybe today you can do something special, just the 2 of you? I know the movie theater is usually open on Christmas Day. Something to cheer him up a bit because it seems Jack is used to being left out.", "Jack has likely been trained not to show that he cares, because caring only makes it worse. NTA. Poor Jack", "NTA.  \nJack accepts it as his lot in life, because that's all he's been exposed to. There's no reason for him to question it, and the behavior is absolutely deliberate.  They've done it for so long that they don't even see it as wrong, anymore.", "WTF is wrong with them?  Spread the hot chocolate across more cups, break the cookies up, and sit on the GD floor as a family if you have to as opposed to sending a freaking kid to eat by himself in another room.  \n\nDefinitely NTA.  If anything, I think you underreacted.", "NTA at all.", "NTA, this is so sad for Jack. To be excluded from everything with family and no one standing up for him. Three times, three times he was excluded! And what's sad like other commenter ha e said, he's probably used to it with him saying it's okay. It's not okay! This is the furthest thing from okay, and no one is remedy this. \n\nYes, you brought him a plate and told your family off, which is a step, but something more needs to happen. You are even second-guessing yourself because he said he's okay, but clearly, he's not if you caught him upset in his room. You're being compliant by not doing anything.", "Nta op... they're taking their anger and resentment out on a teenager for whatever stuff his mom did. Ur parents are responsible for him physically and emotionally,  and the fact that they forgot him more than once during a family event with all other nieces, is a huge reflection of the kinda nonsense that kid must be dealing with, when you or other caring adults aren't home, to call them out on it \n\nHe wasn't even fazed when this happened...... eventually that kid will grow up to hate them and worst case scenario can take a turn to  behavioural issues.\n\nPlease stick up for the kid op.....he truly needs someone in his corner.", "NTA. Is there anyway he can live with you", "Well good that \"the mood is off\" maybe they should be feeling guilty for treating a member of the family so badly.  I hope that feeling of guilt motivates them to stop being such assholes.  Sadly, they'll probably just dig in their heels more.\n\nOP, if you have the space, let him finish high school with you.  \n\nNTA  If you can't take him in, can you maybe connect with him more, like meeting for breakfast somewhere?  That kind of rejection can really mess with someones head.", "NTA...and Jack does care he is just feeling defeated after years of abuse...thank you for standing up for him", "NTA  In my family, if the were a cookie short, someone would have loaded Jack up and took him to get a cookie.  \n\nUnless the store was more than 2 hours away, then they could have made arrangements to make it up to him in another way.", "NTA\nAt all!!!!", "No, you had it right the first time.", "I suspect that a lot of these are NR.", "1-800-668-6868. Still remember from my own shitty Canadian childhood", "I was joking... good on you for standing up for him when no one else would", "shit, i\u2019m 24 and if we were somehow short a cookie i can promise my dad would at the very least offer me his before just straight excluding me. this all makes me so sad for jack."]}
