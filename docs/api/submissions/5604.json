They were short one though and immediately looked at Jack and said \u201csorry buddy, must\u2019ve miscounted\u201d\n\nJack just shrugged it off. I offered to give him mine but he said he didn\u2019t want it. \n\nThen it was time for dinner and everyone went to sit at the table while Jack quickly went to use the washroom. I noticed that there were no empty seats but before I could say anything Jack entered the room and my mom said \u201cI don\u2019t think we have anymore space on the table... would you mind eating in the kitchen?\u201d \n\nHe didn\u2019t even reply and went to his room instead. No one really cared and didn\u2019t even blink at him going to bed after not eating all day. I felt really bad though. We didn\u2019t have any extra chairs but I\u2019m sure someone could\u2019ve thought of SOMETHING. I would\u2019ve even given him my own chair. I made him a plate and then went to go find him. I wouldn\u2019t say he was crying but when I entered his eyes were red insanely red and he looked incredibly sad. He was embarrassed but thanked me for the food. \n\nI left so as to not make him uncomfortable but I was so upset.\n\nMy nieces left to go do their own thing and my siblings+parents noticed that I was upset and asked me what was wrong. I just said \u201cyou\u2019re all so fucking terrible\u201d. \n\nThey all went silent but I continued and told them that idk if they were mistreating Jack on purpose but they\u2019d better be ashamed of themselves. \n\nThey\u2019re all upset with me now and insisted that they really didn\u2019t mean to ignore/exclude him and that it\u2019s unfair for me to say these things. They\u2019re saying I ruined the night and am overreacting and that if Jack has an issue he\u2019d say so.

He\u2019s no nonchalant about it because of that. Hearing about how his mother is unfit to care for Jack, I personally believe his grandparents are taking out their feelings on his mother on him. This isn\u2019t fair to him and they need to be ashamed of themselves. You are absolutely not the asshole for calling them out on that. They may not be completely aware of it but now that they are they need to change, or else that kid may go down the same path as his mom.", "Your sisters are in their 30s and Jack is 15, so I'm guessing your sister had him in her teens. Is that right? It seems like your parents are expressing their disappointment in your sister on Jack, and it's probably been happening his whole life. I have a large family too. We would never tell someone to eat in another room or \"forget\" or \"miscount.\" If it was a miscount, why was Jack always the last to be offered a treat? If I were you, I would start getting treats for only you and Jack. \"Sorry, I guess I miscounted.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. I don't think you overreacted at all.\n\nAre you in the U.S.?

Maybe you could have started the convo with them in a better way so that they would have been more receptive but it\u2019s hard when your emotions get the best of you. Teenagers that age, especially boys, don\u2019t really speak up about that stuff and the fact that he went to his room instead of eating in the kitchen says a lot and they should have noticed.
