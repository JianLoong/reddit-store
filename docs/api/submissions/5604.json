Do what you can to let him know you are an adult he can turn to, have a shoulder to cry on, get hugs from, someone that is on his side forever and always.

Granted, the kids I've done with hasn't been bc of.mistreatment, just bc I want to make sure they have an adult they can turn to for the hard and scary things life can throw at them. They know they have someone they can contact at any time day or night, it doesn't matter ifni haven't seen or talked to them in 5 years, if they need me I'll do the best I can to help them. \n\nThis comes in the form of not only establishing a relationship with them, and letting them see I am on their side.

So they can find us if we have to be found. \n\nMy husband and I are getting ready to start the process to become foster parents. One of the things we have talked about and agreed on is to make sure that any kid we have in our care, regardless if it's 3 hours, 3 days, or 3 years, will always have someone they can turn to when they need it. Our ability to help them may be limited due to whatever is going on, but we can do the best we can and at least be on their side. We are going to set up a separate email and have even talked about possibly getting a separate cell phone just for this purpose. Write down all the info they would need to get in contact with us, and tell them to keep that little piece of paper safe and on them. So if they just need to talk, if they need to escape a bad situation, if they are scared, if they turn 18 and dk what to do whatever. We will do what we can to the best of our abilities (and what we legally can do). I am hoping this will be a good idea for any kid we foster.\n\nSomething I have learned is, sometimes the only thing we can do for those in need is let them know we are on their side and they have someone to talk to.

I want to drive to their house and take Jack!", "I wondered if his room was under the stairs, because this is some Harry Potter living with the Dursleys level treatment. Even if OP can't take custody, hopefully they can do more for Jack. Take him places, special outings and such. I'm sure he was grateful that one person cared.", "Absolutely this. He needs to know someone cares and is looking out for him, and he needs out of the situation he's in. OP, your parents are clearly unfit to parent him.", "NTA. Your mom should have given Jack her drink, and your dad should have given him his cookie - AS ANY NORMAL CARING GUARDIAN WOULD if they'd accidently overlooked a family member.\n\nThis is so pointed and so cruel. And way to project then claiming that YOU ruined Christmas - they're just feeling guilty at their child neglect being exposed...\n\nThank you for looking out for Jack - PLEASE do more for him. He needs someone to care because the rest of your awful family won't. X", "NTA- and the assumption that he would have said something is just categorically wrong and is a stupid fantasy they are using to live guilt free. Poor boy knows he is unwanted and unloved- of they made a mistake any human being with a heart would have done what you did- give up your own cookie. Buy a chair or ask someone to bring one. \nJack has internalized that there is something wrong with him, that he is worthless and unworthy of love. Glad you stood up for him and some common morality. It\u2019s not your responsibility but I hope you can do more for him, you have courage and a good heart!", "literally crying rn. I promise you that Jacks gonna remember that his auntie noticed that mistreatment and actually stood up for him. shame on your family for allowing that to happen. poor kid", "NTA. The poor kid is used to being treated like this. That's the really sad part. I'd tell them they better fix that shit or I'd start telling the family."]}
