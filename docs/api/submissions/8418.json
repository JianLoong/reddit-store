I was just at home, in bed sleeping for a while and my Dad(54 m) came and demanded that I go to the shops with him. I was ill and didnt really have the energy, so I said no. I just wanted to rest. When I said that he seemed ok at first, went away then came back with blatantly fake tears and saying \"I'm just so stressed right now... so stressed. Please just come.\" I again, said no. He proceeded to put his hands to his head and freak out yelling things like \"Please! Everyone is so stressed right now, PLEASE! I'm having a break down because of you.\" And I was shocked. I was ill and he knew it, (flu and phneumonia) and had only got out of hospital the day before. I couldnt really walk for long as my legs were too weak as I had done nothing but sleep for 2 weeks in hostpital. I still said no, and he just started freaking. I didnt really know what to do, so just went to my Mums room where she was and slept while my Dad stormed out of the house.
