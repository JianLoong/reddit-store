I share 50/50 and very similar situation on my end. My ex has not remarried but has been with the guy for over three years. I took it upon myself to GET TO KNOW THE MAN AROUND MY KIDS. You should have done the same understanding your ex remarried, thus this \u201cJoey\u201d will be around your kids a lot. You have to trust your ex has your kids wellbeing in mind as well and wouldn\u2019t put them in an unsafe scenario. If you don\u2019t trust she does, then that\u2019s a whole other issue and you\u2019d be needing to battle for more than 50/50 at that point. If I were you I\u2019d look at this as \u201cdamn, this made me uncomfortable. I need to figure out what would make me comfortable with it.\u201d ie. get to know Joey.", "YTA. This is not some random person, it\u2019s your ex\u2019s husband. She\u2019s accountable to you for their safety but is under no obligation to give you a minute by minute accounting of what the kids do. It sounds like Joey is treating your boys really well but if you\u2019re a good Dad yourself, this should not be an issue.", "\u201cOther people\u201d? You mean their stepdad? \nYou realize he is your ex\u2019s husband, someone who is and will be part of their life?\n\nYou also realize that if your ex has to work night/ weekend and similar during her week, he would be taking care of them? Would she need to inform you of that too?\n\nInstead of being eaten by jealousy, get to know the guy. He is huge part of your kids life and he seem to like them so be happy about that.", "YTA, he has been a step parent to them for a few years, you haven't made the effort to get to know him even though he's (presumably) been in the same household for that long. It's not up to you what relationship they have with him.", "For God\u2019s sake, be glad that your kids have a good step dad who apparently likes them and vice versa. Parents who are jealous of their kids\u2019 (decent) stepparents are pathetic. The more loving and caring people in your kids\u2019 loves, the better. \n\nIf you have any real reason to have issues with Joey, invite him out for a beer and try to establish some kind of civil relationship. Your kids don\u2019t need unreasonable tension among their parental figures. \n\nSource: I\u2019m a stepmom who has always had a strong relationship with my stepson. His mom has always been jealous of that and spent decades trying to guilt him about that, and about loving his dad. Guess which parent he doesn\u2019t spend time with now that he\u2019s an adult?", "YTA. Joey is their stepfather, it\u2019s totally appropriate to take them camping. He\u2019s not some random stranger. You just seem jealous of his role in their life.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a rational reason to be upset here. Their stepfather took them camping\u2026.", "YTA. He's not some rando off the street, he's their step father who has been in your kid's life every other week for that past 3+ years.", "YTA\n\nShe married Joey a few YEARS ago.  He offered to her to take them fishing and camping. Do things in the woods.  Nothing wrong. I\u2019m guessing they were not forced into going, so be happy they are getting to experience something.  Joey is their stepdad and must be one of the good ones.", "YTA. This is your own insecurity talking.", "YTA.\n\nThis man lives with your kids, he\u2019s part of their day to day life. It may have been nice to give you a head\u2019s up but she didn\u2019t need to, nor does she need permission to let the kids spend time with their stepdad. It\u2019d be one thing if this was a random man she had only been with for a few months, but she\u2019s been married to him for years.", "YTA.   She doesn\u2019t need to ask your permission for her kids to go camping with your kids.", "YTA.  It's not about Joey or your sons going off camping.  It's your jealousy that Joey gets to do stuff with your sons and you don't. \n\nThat's part of blended family life, and while you and your ex may be better apart, this is the trade-off.  I'd imagine she'd be able to talk about tons of things you did with the kids during your time with them that she missed out on.  \n\nBe happy that she married a man that treats your kids well and that your kids like.  There are plenty of stories here where that isn't the case.", "It makes me laugh that some bios will do everything in their power to control the other parent, but will shudder at the very thought of trying to get to know the person who is around their kids. \n\nYTA, Charlie Brown. Grow a pair and meet Joey", "YTA, you sound more jealous than worried about your kid", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to micro manage each other while you have the kids. Not how this works. If Joey is being good to the kids, and the kids like him you should realize how good you have it. That should be what you want for your kids and step parent.", "NAH\n\nI think everyone could take a bit of a chill pill in this situation but I don't think anyone's the A. I think it's reasonable to want to know when your kids on going on a trip, regardless of who it's with, just so you know where they are for safety reasons. I also think that it's fine that your ex's husband to take them places and being responsible for them, he is basically babysitting them and he will be in their life for awhile so bonding is a good thing, nothing crazy there.", "Soft YTA, since the man is their stepfather. He should be able to spend time with the kids. \n\nBut, FYI that a lot of custodial agreements have a \"right of first refusal\" clause, where each parent has the prerogative to be the \"babysitter\" when the other one isn't available. In other words, if your ex isn't actually going to be with your kids during her designated time, then she has to give you the option to take the kids before she asks anyone else. \n\nI doubt that a judge would sign off on this without specifically allowing the stepfather to be part of that agreement. But, it would prevent any situations like \"we called a babysitter.\"", "NAH I guess.\n\nThere is definite assholery for you making this about them being alone with him, when it's clear this is about your fear of them bonding with another father figure.\n\nOTOH, you are a 50% custodial parent and yeah, you should probably be told when they are going to be out of pocket with a non-custodial adult, regardless of the trustworthiness of that person.", "YTA. One more person loving and caring for your kids is a good thing.", "ESH - he isn't some stranger and you have to accept that he will be part of your kids' life. You should be happy that he is actively doing something with them.\n\nBut I do think - not asking - but telling you is something your ex should've done. Knowing where they are - so you know in case of emergencies - should be communicated.", "NTA-ish. Joey's not a custodial parent, so while I'd certainly not object to him taking the kid's camping or fishing (he is part of their daily after all) I would want to know, particularly if my ex weren't going along.", "NAH. I get the worries, and I think it would\u2019ve been better of her to inform you this was happening. She doesn\u2019t need your permission, though. If it\u2019s possible, come to an agreement where she informs you of stuff like this before it happens - just so you know where the kids are, too.", "NTA. I would not be ok with it either.  Obviously it would be different if she also went. She has 50% of the custody not Joey.", "NAH \n\nYes,she can do she wants with on her own time and you shouldn't attempt to control that all\n but you are *valid* for concerns because a lot of us read constantly how children are harmed by close people within the family.\n\nDon't react to Joey's antics though,  it's going to make you appear to be jealous and unable to move on. **Also don't let any person you're seeing act like that and be mindful to have the same concerns that you have with them as well**\n\nJust talk to them about what is and isn't appropriate for anyone to do them and they should tell someone asap.", "I wouldn\u2019t have appreciated that either. Definitely not the ahole.", "Not only that what about missed phone calls or FaceTime \nPerents in the situation need to know\nSome pRents dont want kids on sm posted by someone else\nNta and create  a fu bunder to track the missed ft\nSome people want to elim bio dads for sp.", "Unpopular but ESH I feel it's not unreasonable to want to know the person having your children alone unsupervised HOWEVER this doesnt move more past a respectful relationship to ensure they are okay to be around your kids they dont have to be friendly with you", "NTA.  At all.  Protect your minor children.", "I don\u2019t care about getting major downvotes but NTA. I think people calling you T A H aren\u2019t taking into account that just because he\u2019s the stepfather doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the right to be concerned. If it were me, I\u2019d be concerned too because those are my kids. People are focusing more on the fact that you seem jealous of Joey which, that\u2019s your business to deal with if you are, but you just wanted to know where your kids were when you tried to FaceTime them, and were concerned when you found out they were away, which I think is valid. Yes she can do what she wants on her time, yes Joey has been apart of their lives for a long time, but I think all parents worry about their kids when they go places, no matter if they trust the person their kids are with or not. My parents would send me and brother to our aunt or grandparents house to stay with them sometimes when I was young and they are all very much present and (still) active in my everyday life, but my parents still worried about us no matter how much they trusted them. A lot of people on Reddit won\u2019t try and put themselves in your shoes or actually think about the situation. And they\u2019re quick to focus on the negative parts of every story. Sure you may feel some sort of way about Joey, but the petty comment on the FB post, she seems a bit messy and Joey could very well be like that too. But of course everyone believes they know your entire life based on one instance. And on a final note, just because he\u2019s their stepfather and your ex\u2019s husband don\u2019t mean a thing, a lot of people are wolves in sheep\u2019s skin (l\u2019m not trying to alarm you, but I\u2019m just saying). I\u2019m not saying you should assume the worst, but just because he\u2019s her husband doesn\u2019t automatically mean you can rule out him ever doing something bad. Yes trust is something that should be there and is great and all, but I think if everyone it\u2019s truly honest, a little bit of distrust is a good thing.", "ESH. OP should have gotten to know the step dad. It's been a few years and this man has been spending lots of time with OPs children. \n\nEx wife sucks because I would assume it's common courtesy to at least notify the other parent when the children are going to be with a 3rd party overnight. Especially of it's the first time. \n\nIn this day and age people can never be to careful with their children", "I would say NTA assuming if she told you you wouldn\u2019t of said no. She could\u2019ve given you a heads up though in case of an emergency", "NTA\n\nHonestly I don't think it's a big deal the step dad wanted to bond however I will say your ex should have communicated with you that they would be out of touch and gave you a location just so you wouldn't be worried when they didn't answer your facetime call. As you said you regularly call them when you're not with them so your ex probably should have known you'd try to call them.", "NTA these people are wild. There's a boilerplate clause that can be added to custody agreements which states that the parent with physical custody inform the other parent when the child(ren) are spending the night with other people and not at the parents designated residence. While I do think that she has a right to let the kids go on a camping trip with their stepfather, I agree that you have a right to know where your children are and who they're with at night.\n\nEditing to add: as a survivor of abuse and assault, your wife is an idiot for her statement about assholes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
