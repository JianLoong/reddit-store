That is weird AF to be honest... I feel like that's more personal than anything, you just want a person there lol how is that a problem?", "NTA - YOU are giving birth. YOU get to make 100% of the decisions for who is in the room with you. When HE is pushes a person out of HIS vagina he can pick who is in the room, until then he can shut the fuck up.", "NTA.  You get to choose your backup support person (and your primary person TBH), no arguments.", "Info:  What does he have against your best friend?", "NTA. HELL FUCKING NO! you are about to go through a painful and emotional event. If you want someone there it\u2019s your choice. My rule is the pregnant person makes all decision from the labor starts and two weeks after (guests).", "NTA, and he is being absolutely ridiculous and controlling.\n\nChildbirth is a dangerous process already without trying to wait around on his schedule. You and your child's health are the priority here, not him", "NTA - HE thinks it would be best for ALL OF YOU if it is him or nobody? WTF? You are the one who is giving birth, so the only one who gets to make this decision is you. If he sticks to his position on this, I would reconsider letting him be your support person even if he is available. \n\nI don't care if your best friend is the absolute worst person in the world. When it comes to you giving birth, whatever is going to make you feel safe and supported is the best option.", "NTA. You\u2019re both obviously intelligent people with a solid plan\u2014and a backup plan! You should have whoever you want with you in the delivery room, and as you already pointed out, safety first. He should be glad that you have it all figured out and glad for the friend\u2019s assistance if need be. Maybe gently remind him that you\u2019d rather have your friend if he can\u2019t safely make it rather than possibly you and your children having to go to his funeral if he can\u2019t safely make it\u2014a bit morbid but it could remind him of exactly why you\u2019re both carefully planning.", "NTA. You're not refusing him to be there. It's simply that if he can't; your friend will be with you. OF COURSE YOUR FRIEND CAN BE THERE IF HE CAN'T. Honestly why in the hell is this even an discussion. You sure as hell aren't doing this alone to spare his fucking feelings, he should be worried for your experience not his weird ideas", "If my spouse told me that I have to give birth alone if they can't be there I'd be divorced in short fucking order.\n\nWhere does he or your relatives get the absolute STONES to suggest you should risk life and limb ALL ALONE if he can't be present? Does he even care about your feelings?\n\nNTA, but you might be if you stay with this man.", "NTA. You\u2019re the one giving birth. Is no way does he have any right to decide who gets to be in the room with you. That is not nor should it ever be his choice. He needs to get the f over it. Have who makes you comfortable and tell him to get a grip.\n\nETA: Also, it\u2019s just incredibly selfish for him to expect you to do it alone if he can\u2019t make it. He\u2019s never going to experience what you\u2019re about to experience so he can just shut his trap and so can anyone who\u2019s telling you you\u2019re in the wrong. At no point did you tell him he wasn\u2019t allowed to come, you simply have a back up person, OF YOUR CHOICE, in case he can\u2019t. That\u2019s beyond reasonable and it\u2019s controlling and selfish for him to say otherwise.", "NTA\n\nI assume that you'd only call your friend if your husband couldn't make it, and your friend would probably understand about leaving once your husband gets there.\n\nYou are the one in labor, so only you can choose who you are comfortable having with you.\n\nIt's even your right to change your mind in the middle of labor and want another person to come in addition to your husband.\n\nParenting only becomes truly equal once the cord is cut. Until baby is born it's mom's body and mom's choice.", "NTA. You are the one giving birth. You are the patient. You are the one who will be vulnerable and in pain.

This is perfectly reasonable. If he can\u2019t be there you get who you want. You\u2019re the one giving birth not him. You\u2019re the one in the vulnerable position in that scenario.

How is you being alone better for *you*? How is it better for someone who *supposedly loves you* to know you\u2018re on your own?", "NTA! Not even a little bit. Not even a vaguest suggestion of one. You & only you should decided who you will feel safest with & most supported by at, possibly, the most vulnerable moment of your life.

I don\u2019t really understand what your husbands problem is. The whole idea of a backup plan is if the primary plan falls through (so, by definition, he wouldn\u2019t be there). It\u2019s also your labor.. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you get to dictate the terms and he gets to be happy you\u2019re doing the hard lifting.", "NTA get YOuR plan together. When he has a baby in his body then he gets to decide.", "NTA, is he always this controlling?", "NTA - I can\u2019t imagine giving birth and laboring alone or with someone I don\u2019t totally want to be around. You\u2019re absolutely putting him as the fist priority but if he can\u2019t make it you should be able to have your best friend there until he can be there, it is extremely unempathetic of him to expect otherwise.", "\u201cBetter for all of you?!\u201d Well, he gets to decide what\u2019s \u201cbetter for all of you\u201d when he is the one carrying and delivering a baby!

There is no A H in this part of the situation and your parents should just stay out of it. And it absolutely makes sense that you pick the backup support person you want. Your husband is being ridiculous with his demands.", "NTA. Your husband is being unreasonable. Him or no-one? Who is going to be pushing this baby out? He is currently putting his comfort above yours. Of course he would be your first choice so maybe he is feeling upset there might be a chance he would miss that but the bigger picture is you don't want to do it alone and you have someone in mind who would bring you comfort.

You know that if you decided that you didn't want HIM there, that's also a valid request, right?", "Your husband is a major asshole. If he cannot make it he wants you to have no one rather than the person YOU - who are giving birth - wants. He does need to be there but he cannot commit to that. So you want a contingency. That does not make you an asshole. Either he takes the tome off, comes home or shuts up about having a backup plan. If he cannot make it he gets zero say who is there with you. That changes when he is the one giving birth. I can't get over his assholery. You are NTA.", "Your body, your choice momma.

Is he birthing your baby HIMSELF? No? Then he has absolutely nothing to say about who you have in the delivery room. Ask your friend to be back up. Hell, ask her to be there anyway. You're giving birth to a child! YOU get to decide. His controlling ass can go suck a lollipop. Nothing more to be said.", "NTA. It's not great that his jealousy is more important than your comfort and safety.", "NTA. You need someone there to advocate on your behalf while you are in the hospital.

With birth you gotta have plans A, B, and C because babies are unpredictable.\n\nI'm sure it's hard for him to think of the worst case scenario where he won't be there for the birth of his child but he's absolutely being TA! What is it about your friend? His other suggestions are all family members so does he have an issue with her not being family? Does he dislike her personally? Is he insecure about your bond and worries this will tip things too heavily in her favor?\n\nY'all gotta get to the bottom of this. Ultimately it's your call, you're giving birth and anything you say goes! But for the sake of your marriage it's good to settle these issues before a newborn makes an appearance. Best wishes for your birth!", "Is he one of those magical thinking people who think planning for bad outcomes makes them more likely, like \u201cby making a detailed plan B you are inviting it\u201d? \nYou know, the kind of people who don\u2019t want to make a will because \u201ci am not dying yet!\u201d?", "NTA, he can decide on who is present when he has a medical procedure", "Something is very wrong here. Your last paragraph says it should be him or no one. But when discussing it he gave you several options other than your best friend. There is a reason he is so against her being there. When things don\u2019t make sense something is up. Have you ever suspected that something was going on between them? You say they have no real issues other than football (\ud83d\ude44). So wtf?", "That\u2019s a serious asshole move to not be there and then try to dictate who is there in your absence.

I hope this kind of unhelpful reasoning is out of character for him and that he\u2019ll be able to be more clear headed in a moment. Good luck with giving birth to a whole-ass human being! You total got this!", "NTA - you are having a medical procedure which can be lengthy and one where someone familiar to talk to and support you is important. Everyone wants that support to be him but due to weather, that might not be possible. A friend is better than no one esp if you need help making care decisions. \n\nI understand where your husband is coming from - he wants to be there and feels robbed if someone else is. But this isn't a film or a spectator sport. This is ensuring a baby gets safe into the world and anything that helps that by destressing you is worth doing. \n\nI would think though about how any next of kin care questions get dealt with if weather best. They should phone him. Very unlikely but prepare for worst, hope for best.", "NTA. He's overreacting. I mean don't tell him that as it will spark even more fun, but seriously. why can't your BF go?", "NtA for all reasons listed. \n\nBuT!!!!!!!  In about 95% of cases labor is slow enough to call him to meet you at hospital, if not home. Obviously great to have back up plan for the 5%.", "Please do not call an ambulance for a non-emergency during a severe weather event.", "Info why doesn't he just take the time off?? I know you said you guys are trying to save as much you can but still i feel like if he really wants to be there for you. He needs to decide which is more important. \n\n\nBeing there for you or making some more money, if things are really tight is it possible to get some friends or possibly family to help a little??", "Why cant your dad look after your kid and your mother come with you since she is next door? Then your sister can come over and help look after your child.\n\nAnyways you get to choose - he is so selfish to leave you to birth alone and he has no right to dictate who it will be in his absence. This is a deal breaker - go move into your parents if he doesnt relent until he gives in.", "Seconded, your man should be proud to have such a tactically sound woman. \n\nPlus, y'all already have kids together. It ain't about him, the team has to function.", "I'm not quite sure why he has such a big problem with her being there unless he is panicking qt the thought that he won't be.", "Right! Methinks the husband doesn't like the best friend for other reasons bc this isn't logical.", "LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE GODDAMNED BACK.", "This!!!!!! Thank you.", "I've never seen them have a problem outside of football teams. For the most part, they get along well", "Yeah, either he's being a complete and total asshole about this, or there's a \"missing reason\" why the friend being the backup person would upset him.", "It\u2019s giving purity culture religious vibes with the way the only person he thinks should be back up is her sister. Which is in no way his call to make.", "My best friend is a woman who I've been friends with since childhood. She would leave the moment he shows up because she knows I want it to just be him with me. The only problem I've ever seen between them is about football teams.", "We consider it an emergency if I'm in active labor with no way to the hospital. I won't be in my right mind to drive, let alone drive on snow and ice", "How is going into labour a non-emergency event? \n\nWhat do you expect op to do? \n\nShe cannot drive in active labour, ambulances are there for that exact reason it doesn\u2019t matter the weather conditions.", "Babies don't exactly come on a schedule. He would need to take multiple weeks off, taking that time away from being present for OP and the baby while she recovers. I wouldn't consider asking for my family help covering up to 4 weeks of pay to be \"a little\" help.", "Depends on where he works and how flexible they are.  Time without pay also effects insurance if it\u2019s through the job (at least where I am)", "My mom isn't an option due to how she was with my last labor and delivery. She massively overstepped trying to make every decision for us as \"she's my mother\", she took and posted pictures of me at my most vulnerable, posted pictures announcing the baby before I was even able to see baby, and she passed out in the delivery room. We think part of the reason I had an emergency c-section in the middle of delivery was because of the stress she caused.", "I'm shocked that he would rather you be alone for labor and delivery.  That is super fucked up.", "Honestly, that's probably it. He'd rather it be family there so he feels like he hasn't abandoned you at your time of need. His brain might be rationalizing family as the \"in\" group and thus more acceptable, and friends as the \"out\" group, meaning having an \"outsider\" there instead of family would make him feel terrible. \n\nStill NTA because this is all a hypothetical and you should have the support you want and need, regardless of how anyone else feels. I had to give birth with 0 support due to pandemic rules and it sucked. \n\nHopefully it's all a moot point and you don't go into labor during the storm, but you get final day in who is in the delivery room with you. Acknowledge his feelings, but be firm in the fact that you need someone who is good in a crisis and a good support for you.", "Right! If they get along but he doesn't want her there... I feel some shady side stuff going on.", "Honestly? Wouldn't put it past him to have issues with her over football. I've seen pettier things.\n\nNTA. It's good to have a backup plan! Unless he wants a stranger nurse there with ya as support", "right. I can't think of a reason that isn't he thinks OP's best friend is in love with OP or DH had/is having a horrid affair with the BFF and thinks it's awkward for his affair partner to be with his wife when she's in labor.\n\ni'm totally open for a more reasonable 3rd option.", "This makes no sense, I was grasping at straws that maybe best friend was a man. \nSorry for the extra stress, you don\u2019t need this now. I had a January baby, so I know how weather can impact these things.", "You are correct. DO NOT drive yourself in labor. \n\nI have worked and volunteered in EMS. A woman in labor alone is definitely an emergency. You should not be driving even if the roads were perfect.", "It 100% is an emergency.  Someone in labor shouldn't be driving at all,  let alone in bad weather conditions.", "Those are some good points. I suppose i misunderstood the amount of time. I assumed it could have been less than 4 weeks. Potentially. Also i just find it unfair that folks are putting OP down. It definitely a tricky situation especially with the holidays looming by too.", "What do you mean :o dont women just be like :\" okeh bebeh, its time to come out!\" And delivery begins!!", "Oh wow!  That\u2019s all I can say about your mom!", "Yikes. Ok well its your best friend. Your husband needs to know that you need an advocate, someone you trust and someone who can help calm you. He either doesnt do the overtime and takes leave now or your best friend goes with you. Its non negotiable.", "Maybe, this friend is an Old Ex. Or they(BFF and husband) didn't get along when the relationship between OP and her husband was new. Maybe there was a time in HS or College before the relationship that BFF and husband hooked up.", "Could just be he's offended a \"mere\" friend would get to see his child being born instead of him or (still galling, but less so) relatives.", "I was wondering the same thing - lol", "Yeah, anywhere from 37 to 42 weeks is fair game as far as going into labour naturally goes.", "Well i didn't assume that at all. I just assumed since OP said they were at 38 weeks it might take up to  like two or three weeks tops till their baby arrives. Or for all we know they could arrive tomorrow.", "Really, I have to admit I love the conjecture here.  Maybe he just doesn\u2019t like her or is it a him?", "And the uncertainity is the key issue. Maybe they arent financially well off and taking 3 weeks unpaid leave, while also expecting to ever be able to take any paternal leave is just not a possibility.\n\nProblem of Living in a fake \"wellfare country\".\n\nAlso as a finnish-person, id tell them just to put winter tires on and he'd be safe to drive In snow.", "Agreed quite a bit of uncertainty as well we really don't know too much about their financial situation (not that its my business anyways) but it does seem like theres quite a bit to factor in and just going on. \n\nAlso heres hoping they have winter tires.", "Unfortunately we don't have any specific winter tires. We do start off winter with a new set of tires but winter tires aren't really a thing that's normally needed around here. This will be our first snow of the year and they are predicting a few feet minimum. They are telling people to not leave their homes unless absolutely necessary", "Yeah I get that.  We have AWD cause you just don\u2019t know.  Can go years with \nOne snow, buy a car that\u2019s fwd and it snows constantly.  So I get the no snow tires."]}
