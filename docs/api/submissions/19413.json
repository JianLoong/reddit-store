Here's the situation: Our niece was recently diagnosed with cataract, and the doctors suggested surgery that could help.

Katie is also a narcissist who dragged herself into debt because she thought peaking in high school was all that mattered.\n\nHere's some necessary  background: Besides Katie being a narcissist, she was also a bully who tormented my wife from the day of her birth till she left for college. I can't list all the horrible things she did because we would be here forever, but I can mention what her neglectful parents did. Ironically, my wife had vision problems as a child and needed glasses, but her parents refused to pay for them. Eventually, one of her aunts kindly bought her a pair, but Katie intentionally broke them. Her parents then called my wife lazy for needing glasses and refused to replace them. As a result, my wife had to get a part-time job to buy another pair.\n\nFast forward to a recent family gathering where everything came to a head. Katie, fully aware of her daughter's condition and the benefit of the surgery, approached us for help, unfortunately. She explained the situation that we heard vaguely about and asked us to pay, knowing we could easily afford it. But before I could speak, my wife just laughed and said no.\n\nWhen Katie asked why not, my wife brought up the glasses story I mention earlier. However, instead of showing remorse, Katie rebuked my wife for holding a grudge and resenting her daughter for a mistake that happened ears ago. But my wife shrugged her shoulders, and I followed. So after minutes of hearing Katie argue, she financially expressed regret. She apologized, wishing she could go back and change things. But my wife didn't care, refused to accept her apology and told her to fuck off.\n\nLong story short, Katie went back to being the devil with tears, called us selfish for hoarding money that could help her daughter and said my wife was neither a saint herself. She walked away after shouting about all the \"so-called\" horrible things my wife did when she got rich. Then we went home ourselves and received messages about how selfish we were.\n\nI understand that some comments may argue that I'm punishing or depriving a child due to their parents actions, but that only Implies if I'm present.
