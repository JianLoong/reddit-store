Here's the situation: Our niece was recently diagnosed with cataract, and the doctors suggested surgery that could help. However, my sister-in-law, Katie, can't afford the surgery due to her financial struggles. Katie is also a narcissist who dragged herself into debt because she thought peaking in high school was all that mattered.\n\nHere's some necessary  background: Besides Katie being a narcissist, she was also a bully who tormented my wife from the day of her birth till she left for college. I can't list all the horrible things she did because we would be here forever, but I can mention what her neglectful parents did. Ironically, my wife had vision problems as a child and needed glasses, but her parents refused to pay for them. Eventually, one of her aunts kindly bought her a pair, but Katie intentionally broke them. Her parents then called my wife lazy for needing glasses and refused to replace them. As a result, my wife had to get a part-time job to buy another pair.\n\nFast forward to a recent family gathering where everything came to a head. Katie, fully aware of her daughter's condition and the benefit of the surgery, approached us for help, unfortunately. She explained the situation that we heard vaguely about and asked us to pay, knowing we could easily afford it. But before I could speak, my wife just laughed and said no.\n\nWhen Katie asked why not, my wife brought up the glasses story I mention earlier. However, instead of showing remorse, Katie rebuked my wife for holding a grudge and resenting her daughter for a mistake that happened ears ago. But my wife shrugged her shoulders, and I followed. So after minutes of hearing Katie argue, she financially expressed regret. She apologized, wishing she could go back and change things. But my wife didn't care, refused to accept her apology and told her to fuck off.\n\nLong story short, Katie went back to being the devil with tears, called us selfish for hoarding money that could help her daughter and said my wife was neither a saint herself. She walked away after shouting about all the \"so-called\" horrible things my wife did when she got rich. Then we went home ourselves and received messages about how selfish we were.\n\nI understand that some comments may argue that I'm punishing or depriving a child due to their parents actions, but that only Implies if I'm present.

I meant katie didn't take school seriously and wanted to the \"popular girl\" and because of that. she couldn't get a decent job and is now struggling", "im confused by what they mean by that anyways. in debt in high school?? if not in high school, what does her peaking in high school have to do with this lol", "Block them and forget about it", "We have never met her. We only know a few basic things.", "I'll answer that one, she's not our niece, or we can't afford it, or we weren't asked. Take your pick. \n\nYTA", "I think that simplifies things then. Definitely NTA and I would find this even easier to decline.", "lol why do people post here and then act blind whenever they see INFO", "They have never even met the kid. So how do we even know SIL telling the truth", "yes we have never met our niece", "You good home boy..", "NTA\n\nGood for you for supporting your wife!   Karma's a b*tch.  \n\nI do feel badly for the child but, that's all on mommy dearest.", "I did not get the impression that OP has never met the niece, just that they\u2019re not close. I don\u2019t financially support any children, but that\u2019s because I don\u2019t have the financial ability to do so.", "Yeah I know.", "I can\u2019t speak for you or OP\u2026but a child in my family is loved by more than just her parents.  This child presumably has grandparents, and possibly other aunts, uncles or cousins with whom OP and his wife are on good terms.  That they have no relationship with the girl doesn\u2019t mean they have no connection to her. She is a member of their extended family, and to turn their backs on her because of a grudge against her mother is cruel.  Cruelty is an asshole move.  I stand by my vote.", "You are sitting back\u2026and now you\u2019re trying to excuse it by hiding behind your wife\u2019s choice.  That\u2019s a cop out.  you\u2019re just doubling down on YTA.", "This comment right there makes YTA. Your wife won't even look at pictures of her niece, who is a child,  because of a grudge she holds against the mother? Your only reason for not helping if because of a grudge she holds against the mother? \n\nYou aren't obligated to pay for anyone else's children but the way you talk about a child who has no fault in this situation is disgusting and makes me think maybe this isn't the whole story and the sister isn't as bad as you say.  I hope no one holds the children you have (or have in the future)  accountable for the gross human beings you are.", "You never met her. Are you sure this isn\u2019t a scheme your SIL cooked up?", "Was that in the original post? I think it\u2019s pretty important. If you had a relationship with her then it feels way worse to let her struggle with deficient eyesight than if it\u2019s a kid you have never even laid eyes on.", "Why didn\u2019t you put that in the original post; there\u2019s zero debate or moral dilemma with that info. NTA. \n\nMight as well be a Nigerian prince asking you to wire some money so he can import gold bars or something.", "Then for sure don't fall for it. It might be a lie to get your money.\n\nStand your ground and keep that toxic messes away.\n\nNTA", "I think the nuance here is that neice is practically a stranger. Don't get me wrong ... a stranger based on fact that OP's wife was willing to create that distance as well.\n\nBut I think that from OP's perspective, this might as well be an unknown little girl from across the world. \n\nNow from OP's wife's perspective, it's her abuser's child.  I can't answer this for her. Does she want to be her abuser's child's savior? *shrugs* Does she want to punish a child because she's in her own pain that hasn't been resolved? *shrugs* She might regret this later. Or she might not. \n\nBut I can appreciate that as a victim herself, wife is burdened with a moral dilemma. She's evidently not healed enough to come at this at least without bringing up the past. Without some hurt. \n\nI think OP's dilemma stems from wanting wife to NOT regret all this,  at a later date here.\n\nEDITs: Typos.", "I meant the family members who called us selfish. not you. Are you ok? you seem mad", "He\u2019s never even met this child - that\u2019s how little relationship they have with Katie and her daughter. You are essentially asking them to fund a surgery for a stranger.\n\nYou can\u2019t be estranged from someone for years and then ask for a *gift* (she didn\u2019t even ask to borrow and pay it back) of several thousand dollars, no matter the purpose.", "Ok send them them money.  Because  they have they money doesn\u2019t mean they have to give it out to a person who has been terrible to his wife( wife choice). Sometimes you burn bridges you can\u2019t cross.", "my wife doesn't have to look at her abuser child. she has cut all contact besides the few times they have bumped into each other on family events. that's it. why would she need a reminder of her sister.", "You're holding on to a grudge against an adult and taking it out on an innocent child.  At least when your SIL did those things to your wife they were both young and hopefully she would know better now.  Your wife is now a full blown adult making a conscious choice to treat her niece that way. That's mind blowing to me.", "my sil was older than my wife and knew exactly what she was doing as it carried on for 18 years. children know the difference from wrong to right most of the time and even if she didn't then katie would have asked for forgivenes a long time ago and not when she needs money.", "Most people aren't saying YTA because you don't want to pay.  $7000 is a big ask.  YTA because, again,  you're holding a grudge against a little girl who has never done anything to you.  Which you obviously aren't comprehending, so good luck with everything.", "This is not about a little girl. This is about parents(adults) who went about being mean people. Tell me how many times you gave money to people who were evil to you?? I will wait.. and yes there children are extensions.. that\u2019s why is nice to be nice", "I'm not saying they should pay.  I don't give a rats crapper if they pay or not.  I'm saying they are the asshole for the view and feelings they have towards a literal child.  It's misplaced bitterness. I have relationships with younger generations of family members whose parents I hate, it's not their children's fault.  And many kids who have narcissistic parents can benefit from having some normalcy in their lives. Someone who looks down on a child because of the actions of the parents is an AH.", " I don\u2019t think they feel one way or another about the child\u2026 I think they feel I don\u2019t deal with you ( the parents) so I don\u2019t know want to be involved ..  it could be considered a sad situation because the parents have burn bridges, they can\u2019t cross again. But it\u2019s no fault of these people."]}
