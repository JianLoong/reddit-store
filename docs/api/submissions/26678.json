There are times that you cannot and should not hide the wealth. When you get married, you have the wedding you want. When you buy your first home, it should be the house you want and can afford, etc.\n\nBut you can be more sensitive to displaying your wealth in smaller situations.

Like I had someone call me out once when I described an action of my parents as narcissistic and it was odd having someone get so serious with me about arm chair diagnosing my own parents with a personality disorder when all I had done was describe a behavior of theirs. Funny thing about that though was they had no way of knowing if my parents actually have NPD. Even funnier is that they both do have a personality disorder, it\u2019s just BPD, not NPD.\n\nI gotta say tho, I like how considerate you seem to be based on your first comment :) it\u2019s a good trait for a person to have", "I\u2019m in the center of the US \ud83d\ude05 that sounds awesome!
