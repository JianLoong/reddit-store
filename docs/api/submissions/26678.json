I'm sure they're more than happy to get mad on behalf of the stepchildren they deign to recognize, but I'm sure that part of this vitriol is because they don't think that OP deserves the gifts *and love* she received at the party by the arbitrary providence of her birth.", "Thank you, i will be in Bruges in two months or so", "Envy means discontented longing for someone else's advantages.
