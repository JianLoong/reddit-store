Don't wait until your parents are dead though, start finding out what options are out there for your brother so he can live a fulfilling life to the best of his abilities while allowing you both to have a good relationship with each other.", "NTA it's obvious by them saying \"he'll find a good and smart girl to help him\" they are not making plans for him to have a caretaker, they're thinking some girl will get roped into being his life long caretaker. Very honestly, that's not happening. I don't see any woman trying to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't and likely will not have the mental capacity of an adult. Not without malicious intentions, especially if he can get some government funded money to pay for caretakers the rest of his life. They need to plan now while he's still young or they'll be caring for him forever, which eventually means that you, the older and more capable sibling will be tasked to care for him when they're getting old.", "You are NTA, and neither are your parents. They are stuck in the grief process at denial. They want a life of love and happiness for him. Hard to be too angry at them for that. Hopefully they can adjust to reality and envision what that looks like for your brother given his circumstances. He deserves a life of happiness.", "NTA. You're the most realistic one in your family.\n\nBut, OP, keep your mouth shut! Otherwise, YOU'LL end up as your brother's caretaker. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but if that's not the future you envision for yourself, it would be very unfair - but totally in character - for your parents to expect that of you.", "NTA - make sure you tell your parents, you will not be your brother caretaker too.", "NTA \n\nIf he's that mentality disabled, he probably isn't legally able to consent to marriage.  \n\nAs for jobs, sounds like bagging groceries is too difficult to understand.  Definitely not any office job.  \n\nMaybe collecting trash, pushing a broom, digging/filling holes with a shovel, some plant care for a greenhouse?  Supervised & supported in everything.  \n\nOthers have suggested a sheltered workshop & group home, which is probably the best thing for him because he can improve as much as possible but get help with everything else.", "NTA - As you plan for your own future, make sure that your parents don\u2019t foist responsibility for your brother onto you because they failed to plan.", "Wow she\u2019s delusional. NTA", "NTA\n\nMy brother is 24, but has the intellectual development of an elementary schooler. I love him dearly and I would do anything for him. But I know that he isn't going to live a \"normal\" life like my sisters and I will. And that's okay. \n\nThat all being said, it sounds like your brother will need a certain amount of support on a daily basis for the rest of his life. And good care costs money. If you're in the USA, look into an ABLE account for him. Your state/county/area should have resources for disabled individuals, or at least social workers or something. \n\nI'm sorry that the responsibility seems to be falling to you. You shouldn't have to take on the responsibility that your parents are in denial of.", "NTA when he is legally an adult, which is very soon, his parents will need to apply for permanent legal custody of him", "My parents are in their mid 80\u2019s and not gonna be around much longer. I am the primary caretaker for my mentally and physically disabled 57 year old baby brother. Please OP, do everything in your power to ensure your brother is in the system as mentally disabled before he turns 18. Mine wasn\u2019t and getting help for him as an adult is almost impossible. Plus my dad was then - and still now delusional about his capabilities. There are way more resources now than in the 1960\u2019s & 1970\u2019s. My brother would have been so much better off if he was in a group home instead of living in poverty and squalor for his entire adult life. Now he is in a better place, but it is taking its toll on me and my husband.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what country you live in, but my cousin is developmentally delayed and when he turned 18, the state legally took away his right to get married, among other things. This was done after interviews and the lady said it\u2019s a big deal to take away someone\u2019s rights, but it\u2019s to protect someone with disabilities from being taken advantage of.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s possible for two people with disabilities sometimes to marry each other. You occasionally hear about married couples with Down Syndrome. They are still dependent on caregivers, but are able to have companionship.\n\nSo your mom is wrong that a woman without disabilities would be willing to take on a caregiving role for a dependent husband. But your brother may yet find companionship and that would be grand for everyone.", "Just want to add that I can sympathize with the \u201cdoctors are wrong\u201d mentality. When my daughter was four, doctors told me it wasn\u2019t autism, it was likely mental retardation, and college was out. The delays were pretty profound at that point. Turns out it was autism, and she is now an undergrad business major, on the dean\u2019s list, and doing a semester abroad.\n\nThat said, it was clear by age 16 that she was capable of living on her own. At some point you do have to be realistic.", "NTA. I feel ya. My older brother had issues and developed beyond that, but not enough to really have an adult relationship or marry. He was on disability and lived in group homes and eventually in kind of assisted living apartments until he passed at the age of 48. Your parents need a dose of reality. Please reach out to your brothers doctor and tell him that your mother is in denial and not making appropriate arrangements. He should have a social worker now and be on disability as well. These thing must be established prior to 18 for best long term results. But other adults need to step in for his sake. \n\nI'm so sorry.", "NTA - I have an autistic brother who is 25 but, like your brother, still in the mind of a 6/7 year old. The reality is that he can't get a white-collar job, and needs 24/7 care. I think your parents are in-denial.\n\nI feel more sad for them because they are clearly hurting but yeah, one of the things we had to prepare my brother for was things like, how he'd never be able to drive a car or anything. I think for your brothers sake, they need to be realistic.", "NTA - My BIL is in his late 30s & really can't look after himself. He has aspergers, can't hold down a job, and still relies on their mother for money. He has been divorced once and scammed multiple times online. My FIL has already given up on him. We are already worried about what will happen when my MIL dies because no one is willing to baby him forever (we have limited space and kids, so we can't take him in). It's a hard situation to be in.", "NTA", "This case NTA. \n\nBut I also think you are being a bit ableist. Because while you know your brother personally, there are people like your brother who do have white color jobs and a nice marriage. And to think someone can\u2019t achieve a \u201cnormal\u201d life because of that is ableist.

I ask because I find it really weird that if he's in a regular school with other 16-year-olds that he won't be able to have a decent life, I also find it unbelievable that if he's not in the regular school and he's in special classes because of his intelligence level that your mother is so deep in denial! Like she has to see that he's not heading in the right direction if he's learning things that 7-year-olds learn. He's literally 10 years behind... There's no catching up from that!\n\nAlso, what did this random nice girl do to her that she wants to relegate her to being a caretaker for a mentally 7-year-old man? Like what part of her brain thinks that any woman wants to \"help him with life\"? I totally agree with you, if he gets on disability or some kind of government payout for his disability than he might find a girl that wants to live off of him. But if he doesn't develop past being a kid, he's not going to want a relationship!\n\n7-year-olds don't want wives! Lol", "", "Regarding their hope, my issue is they\u2019re putting all their eggs in one basket. If they prepare for him to need a caretaker, have money stored for that, and still have hopes that he\u2019ll find a girl, that\u2019s one thing, because even if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll have the means to take care of him ready. What they\u2019re doing instead is not preparing at all because of their hope, meaning in the very likely case it falls through he\u2019ll have no support system", "Thank you for the advice, and I\u2019m sorry to hear about your brother\u2019s passing.", "I would ask her what she means by him finding \u201ca good smart girl to help him\u201d.

That line of thinking lasted well into my preteens.\n\nHowever, Eventually, reality and easy access to the facts made her drop that thinking pretty quick.\n\nIt may take a while longer yet, but she'll probably come to realize it eventually.

At the shows intro the \"un\" part falls off.\n\nThe people looking to date are supported.  For example, each person is interviewed to find out what they are looking for, their interests, the main dating goal (i.e., casual company, serious relationship, marriage).   Pictures are taken.\n\nSo if a match is made, each person is consulted as to whether or not they are interested or not.   Depending on the person's intellectual disability and/or mental age, supervision is provided. \n\nFor example, a couple meets for the first time for a zoo date.  Each person has a chaperone that makes the initial introduction.  The couple go off by themselves but their chaperone is far enough for privacy but close enough if needed.\n\nThere are people on the show that are perfectly fine intellectually and emotionally but have a physical disability that is new or that they have had to deal with since childhood.  Some have extreme tourette syndrome. \n\nIt's a beautiful show, highlighting the human experience.\n\nThe star of the show is Daniel.  He's just a beautiful spirit.  Spoiler alert, though it takes numerous tries he does indeed find his lady love.  She is perfect for him as she matches his super romantic way of going about the world.\n\nThere was one where this woman had such a high level of OCD and germaphobia, she had to work from home.  The only person allowed into her home was her mother.  Her germaphobia was so extreme that even her mother could not hug her.\n\nThey actually found her a date.  The best part was at the end of their date, the guy blew her a kiss goodbye and she blushed.\n\n\nYou can catch some episodes on YouTube.\n\nAny and all should check it out.\n\nOP specifically so that she can find an emotional support group for her brother even if it is just to find friends.", "This is exactly it. It's very likely they want YOU to go to a good college, so that YOU can get a good job, so that YOU have the money and possibly time or other resources to help him.", "I just want to give you a warning for the future. My older brother is similar to yours, but has an older mental age. My mom said his IQ test was wrong because he didn't take tests well.\n\nHe now works minimal hours for a family business in an unskilled labor role, but my mom spent years saying he would take over one day. Eventually, reality started to sort of set in. Little comments about me maybe helping out with managing his finances turned into her framing every decision I was making about my life into how I could be available for my brother. He lives in a little house on my parents' property, and they manage everything for him. My mom kept trying to put more on me, which I refused (doctor appts, paying his bills, taking him shopping, etc.). This started after I finished undergrad, which both parents were very supportive of. My mom often says it's great that I have an education, so I make enough money to support myself and my brother. \n\nHe recently married a woman who is clearly taking advantage of a man who does whatever she says, has \"his own home,\" and is financially supported by family. She has a job but also has an intellectual disability and cannot independently manage her finances. Instead of taking pressure off me, this turned into me now being expected by my mom and the family of his wife to manage both of their lives. That will not be happening, but mostly because my dad has always lived in reality. It sounds like both of your parents are like my mom, so you need to be prepared for what happens when he nears 30 and it becomes more obvious that \"growing out of it\" isn't realistic.", "When I was a kid and asked my step-Dad about God he'd reply \"I'd rather believe there is a God and there not be one, then not believe and there be one.\"  I think this is the same situation.  Your parents need to realize that having a plan in place for long-term care is not them giving up hope, it's having it \"just in case\".  Like having car insurance or an emergency fund.  You hope you don't have to use it, but if it's there if needed.  That's how they need to approach this situation, get a plan in place in case he needs extra supports as an adult.  Basically you CAN plan for supports AND plan for him to have a job and wife, they aren't mutually exclusive.", "Thank you, back. It was almost 15 years ago, so I made peace with it.

Many were disabled as a result of traumatic brain injuries and had significant financial payouts as a result. \n\nTo be fully blunt, thank god OP\u2019s brother is male and therefore less likely to be a target for those disgusting people.
