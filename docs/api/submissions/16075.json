I understand that your parents are holding onto an idea of your brother's future with a very strong desire, and that they love you both dearly \u2014 but what will be their reaction if your brother's development state never changes how they hope it will? this could be disasterous for everyone in the family, but primarily for your brother. I worry that they would begin to resent him, and he doesn't deserve that. that they are ignoring the reality of your brother's mental state can easily be argued as harmful, no matter how completely unintentional; the overwhelming desire to give your child the best life possible is good in parents, but the life a parent dreams of for their child may either be not feasible or may not the best life for their child, to their child.\n\nyou're in a difficult position here, OP, because you can see all the love all around but not being directed in a way that your little brother is going to need. i don't think anyone is the asshole here, but i do think your parents need to open their minds to different possibilities soon.", "NTA.\n\nThe saddest thing about this situation is that OPs parents won\u2019t do anything in preparation for when they die, eventually.

This is one of those situations where you need to tell them the harsh truth for his sake. They need to let go of the fantasy of him being a fully independent adult and start making preparations for him to have a caretaker when they inevitably can\u2019t take care of him anymore. Continuing to ignore the truth will only hurt him.", "NTA. OP, this sounds hard. People are giving good advice here as well. This is so unfair for your brother who needs support to live the best life he can. Your parents aren't doing that for him. They need to help prepare him for a life without them when they die or if they are unable to care for him. This also isn't your obligation.\n\nDoes he have a social worker or someone you could talk to about this? \n\nHe needs to be as independent as he can be and be able to be comfortable outside of the family.\n\nIt's not fair to him or to you.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEDIT: Added NTA", "He needs a group home and his own peers. That is a better space for him to become more independent, develop friendships and maybe even pursue relationships.", "NTA.  Your parents need to pull themselves out of their delusions asap. When he reaches 18 they\u2019ll need to apply for SSDI, SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid for him. My brother is disabled and receives all of those things and lives in a group home. Your brother must be in special education classes. What do your parents think when high school ends? My brother was in high school until at least 21 and it was all special Ed classes. There are work programs your brother could be doing as an adult. He needs a case manager through your social services program for your county/city.\n\nI think I nagged my mom for about ten years about what was going to happen with my brother when she was too old to take care of him. A lot of parents of disabled children expect their other children to take over the care.  That\u2019s not fair to them. She finally realized neither of us were physically capable of taking care of him.\n\nEdit:  You may consider calling social services to ask them what to do in this situation.

It may be helpful for someone else to lay out their options.", "I have seen this in many parents of special needs people.

And it's not mandatory that you are their plan B.", "NTA. They need this reality check.

It seems like your parents are in denial about his intellectual disabilities, and someone needs to rip off the rose-colored glasses.", "NAH\n\nI bet she knows, it's just natural parental inclination to think of and want the best for your kids. What she wants is definitely unlikely! But if it *did* happen it'd be a heck of a lot less worry and work for her. So she can't help hoping for it.", "NTA. In some parts of the world, where you lack better options, marrying the simple guy who will never hurt you isn't a bad choice. If your parents have means and can adequately vet, then not the worst. Sex and other is another question but someone has worded an answer far better than I ever could re disability and sexual need. They do need to work on the means part though, to make sure he's supported.\n\nWe knew a guy, definitely not disability level, but very simple. Constantly ripped off by people. He eventually married a lady who was clearly smarter than him. Whether it was a particularly happy marriage, I don't know. A pragmatic one maybe for her? For him, he was happy.", "NTA You were telling the truth, and it's better they accept the reality they're in sooner rather than later to have a plan as he grows up.\n\nIt's a tough pill to swallow, and I have sympathy for your parents' position, but if they continue to ignore your brothers condition, it'll make his and their lives more difficult later on.", "NTA.

Not sure where you are, but services are available for most needs.

This is why some doctors are now trying to move away from the \"mental age\" frame of reference, because it often doesn't represent the full picture. It's almost never actually as straightforward as \"this is a 6yo in the body of an adult\". It's more like \"this adult has the intellectual and emotional capacity of a 6yo, the dexterity and coordination of a 2yo, the verbal language capacity of a 10yo, and the hormones of an adult including an interest in sex and masturbation\".\n\nI knew a lady in her 60s who had this kind of disability and she'd had several boyfriends over the years, other residents at her group home who had similar mental capacity to her. This lady fully believed her teddy bears were alive and had feelings, but she was also an adult woman with a libido and a desire for romantic connection. When she's dating someone at the same level of disability as herself, who's taking advantage of whom?\n\nObviously it's a massively complex question and one that I'm certainly not qualified to answer. There are all sorts of safeguarding considerations like ensuring that there's adequate protection against pregnancy and STDs being used and that there's enough understanding of consent and how it can be withdrawn at any time. The aim is to find a balance between keeping people safe first and foremost, but also giving them as much respect and autonomy as possible because everyone deserves that.", "In my country individuals with ID have a human right to their sexuality and relationships that should be respected and promoted within services and organizations.

Op needs to contact them and find out if your parents have put you down as responsible for your brother after them. Make it a point to tell the social worker that you will not ever be responsible for your brother or his care. That your parents refuse to make any provisions or plans for his future as they delude themselves he will be able to lead a normal life, work marry and have kids. That you are aware in their minds you are the default back up plan which won\u2019t be happening. Ask them to look into provisions that could be made and any options they know of and could they take them to your parents and go over them.
