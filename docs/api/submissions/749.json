Is there a lift?", "It would be common decency to go down and meet them at the door.", "YWNBTA for just buzzing them in, however without an elevator I hope you throw the delivery people a couple extra bucks for doing those flights.", "NTA. You are paying for a service. Would you pay to have a fridge delivered, and then take it up the stairs yourself because you felt bad for the delivery guys?", "YTA.\n\nI lived in an apartments for a few years. I would never dream of expecting a delivery driver to come inside the building and use the elevator up to the door. If they have a bike or moped that means they need to either leave it unlocked outside or find somewhere to safely lock it. If they're driving they need to find somewhere to park and may risk not having a parking disk for the time spent having to go up to your door.\n\nIt's common courtesy to go meet them outside.", "NTA. If you pay for delivery, it\u2019s delivery to your door. Buzzing them up should be fine. I would factor in the stairs to any future tips tho.", "Isn't that literally the point? NTA", "\u2026idk if this makes you an ah but I feel like it\u2019s customary these days to just go meet them at the door.", "In basically the same situation I always go down and meet them at the door. I do this because sometimes they can take ages to find the right building and me actually being there can speed it up.", "Delivery driver here. I don't mind the extra cardio as long as you tip, but in ontario min wage is $15/hr and I get paid $8/hr. Today I made less than min wage even with tips and I didn't even deduct the gas I burnt.", "YTA. They get paid pretty badly (at least in the US; UK probably the same) and from the sounds of it, you aren't willing to give extra tip if you make them walk up 4 flights of stairs.", "YTA - largely because it\u2019s a safety issue. Someone who doesn\u2019t belong in the building can easily come in right behind the delivery person.", "This where the US tipping custom is actually beneficial.  You can pay for the extra service.  But with no lift and no tip custom YWBTAH if you made them climb up and down 4 flights.  Most delivery workers are on tight schedules. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Adding vote.", "YWBTA \n1. Deliver drivers aren't paid very much, and unless your tipping them well that 20mins it takes for them to get up those steps and find your door can be another delivery started\n2.it will be faster if u meet them, u know the building u won't get lost\n3. As other have pointing out its dangerous, they can let someone in behind them that doesn't belong there", "Yes, exactly. Then how would OP feel if somebody got hurt because of this?"]}
