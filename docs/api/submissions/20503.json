While I do believe this type of thing should be announced beforehand, you saying you might not have even come to the bride and groom is beyond the pale.

Why did you even bring this up *at their wedding* to the bride? You shot yourself in the foot with that one.", "YTA; the point of weddings is to celebrate the couple, not to get smashed.", "YTA.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have even gone if there wasn\u2019t booze? \n\nYeah. YTA.", "YTA. The part where you implied that you might not have come if you had known that there was no alcohol was what put it over the top. You were right about all of the other points, but maybe save that for the groom at a later time if you really felt the need to criticize.", "Silly of your friend for thinking you'd want to attend their wedding to share their celebration, not so you could get drunk. YTA", "YTA. And you seem to have an alcohol problem.", "We didn't have alcohol, dinner, or dancing at our wedding. However, the invitation specifically stated \"cake and punch reception in the fellowship hall immediately following.\" Since the wedding (and subsequent reception) were in a church, I don't think anybody expected there to be alcohol.", "YTA\n\nThe last thing you ever do is criticize somebody about their wedding. You have no idea the amount of planning that goes into it. Unless you are paying for it, keep your mouth shut, and do your best to enjoy the ceremony, or don\u2019t go at all .\n\nThis wedding is about them, not you and your alcohol.", "YTA. If you did not like it, you should have just come up with a polite excuse and left. If you really felt the need to complain, you could have done that later and NOT at the actual wedding. Who throws a fit about not being able to drink for a few hours?! (And in case you are wondering, I have nothing against alcohol and I am a social drinker myself).", "YTA! It\u2019s their wedding, drinking is not the point of the celebration.

You griped about lack of alcohol to the bride and groom during their own wedding reception? And then said you might not have come if you\u2019d known there wouldn\u2019t be booze? Yeah, if booze at a wedding matters more to you than being there for one of your \u201cbest friends,\u201d you are definitely the AH, and it also makes me skeptical about your claims that you don\u2019t have a drinking problem.", "ESH. It doesn't sound like the upset is so much about the lack of alcohol, but the fact that he (and others) spent unnecessarily on Ubers and hotel because this fact was not communicated. The words chosen were poor and it's not nice to say that you might not have come while at the reception. \n\nThat said, people really should have a heads up if it will be a dry wedding. Don't list something as cocktail hour if there are no cocktails. Should say something like \"Social hour. Sodas will be served\"", "ESH- dry weddings are not unheard of, but they are not the norm. This should be announced when invitations are sent out. I\u2019m sure you weren\u2019t the only person who spent unnecessary money thinking you would be unable to drive.\n\nI get that it might have annoyed you. It would have annoyed me too. But having this altercation with the couple on their wedding day was not the time or place.", "YTA\n\n>I would have just driven if i'd known or maybe not even had come.\n\nSounds like you just wouldn't have come. The fact that not coming to support your friend's wedding is an option for you - is so telling. \n\nYou can have a grievance. Air it out with your friend, privately after he gets back from honeymoon. Or work out your feelings at the bar after the wedding.  Drinking isn't a wedding requirement.", "YTA. I agree that they should have told people the wedding would be dry. But that\u2019s not an excuse for you to be rude to the couple on their wedding day. Sometimes you get invited to an event and it\u2019s not what you hoped. Unless you\u2019re literally like, attacked by the hosts, you don\u2019t go up to them and complain.\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for throwing a bad party. You ARE an asshole for marching up to a couple that just got married and whining that they didn\u2019t provide you booze.", "YTA, but this sounds like a major red flag.  If you\u2019re that hung up on booze, you might have a problem.", "YTA\nIf you cannot go without alcohol for one night, you are an alcoholic. Also, if alcohol matters more to you than celebrating your friend's wedding, you aren't a very good friend.", "YTA. It was not your wedding. Her family paid for the wedding and they do not drink. If you and and your friends wanted to grab a drink after the reception ypu could do that. It is kinda sad you could not go 2-3 hours without drinking or not be able to enjoy a free meal without drinking.  You were rude to the bride as well.", ">The bride does not take my commentary well and implies I might have a drinking problem\n\nShe might be on to something here", "YTA. While I too would have been annoyed, you acted really rude and entitled at their celebration. It wasn't the time or place", "YTA.   \n\n\nIf alcohol is absolutely necessary for you to enjoy yourself at a wedding, then you should do the work of verifying it will be available. Since it will factor so heavily into your decision to attend...", "YTA. It\u2019s not your wedding. Be a good friend and just be there to celebrate your buddy\u2019s marriage. Sometimes you gotta eat an L for the homies. All you did was project your L onto him. Not a good friend move.", "YTA for saying what you said, when you said it. I get being pissed about spending money when it wasn\u2019t necessary and they should have mentioned to people it was a dry reception. BUT you were a jerk to have brought it up at the actual wedding. And not a great friend for saying you wouldn\u2019t have come had you known. Eww.", "YTA\n\nYour not paying for the wedding/reception you have NO SAY!  When the alcoholics in my family go to a dry wedding if the reception is in a hotel they make several bar trips. Funerals are always dry and they head to a bar right after. If you absolutely needed a drink, you and your drinking friends could have left after dinner and gone to a bar you didn't have to be the AH at their reception.", "YTA. If you're that angry over no alcohol (to the point where you suggest you wouldn't have even attended if you'd known), it's entirely possible you *do* have a drinking problem.", "YTA. No one told you and your wife to book a hotel room and take Ubers. How was this couple supposed to know that you were financially invested in getting drunk at their wedding? I agree that they should have informed guests in advance that they were having a dry wedding but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to confront them about it at their wedding reception. The fact that you said you would have consider not attending if you knew there wouldn\u2019t be booze shows that you aren\u2019t really their friend. You can get drunk any time so the opportunity to see one of your best friends get married should mean more to you than alcohol. I hope you enjoy your friendship with this guy because it\u2019s probably over now.", "Maybe he\u2019s one of your \u201cbest friends\u201d but I hope for his sake you aren\u2019t one of his. I hope every other friend he has is better than you. YTA.", "YTA. I could understand being a little disappointed, but to actually be *angry* there wasn\u2019t alcohol?  I agree with the bride, you might have a problem.", "ESH. \n\nGentle AH to the bride and groom for not specifying on the invite that it would be a dry wedding. At the absolute minimum your mate should have spread the word to his side of the guestlist that the wedding is dry at the wife\u2019s family\u2019s request because he would have known the guests would expect it. \n\nBigger AH is the OP for actually saying this to the bride and groom DURING THE RECEPTION like a f*cking moron. Then going on to say that he wouldn\u2019t have come? That\u2019s either an exaggeration, a troll, or he\u2019s going to have to find some new friends.", "YTA. Yes, it\u2019s considered courteous to let guests know about a dry wedding ahead of time because, as you said, people do make plans and safety accommodations based on having alcohol. If all you\u2019d done was note that to your friends, no foul. It\u2019s an annoyance. \n\nTelling one of your \u201cbest\u201d friends that *you might not have come to his WEDDING* just because you weren\u2019t going to be able to get drunk is rude as shit. And it\u2019s definitely not an indication that you have a GREAT relationship with alcohol. Literally saying that celebrating your friend\u2019s life milestone is ruined by not being able to get plastered during it\u2026 not exactly good. You have some apologizing and some soul searching to do.", "I hate dry weddings. I feel ya. I usually avoid them unless I\u2019m actually really close to the individual.", "NTA I don't even drink for my own reasons and I think not telling people that it's a dry wedding is absolutely absurd. \n\nMy husband and I went to a wedding and we paid for a hotel room as did many other people as to not wanting to drink & drive.\nMany people to let loose and have a good time And they were upset over the fact it was a dry event.\n\nAbout 3/4 of the guests left when they found out. And took thier gifts back. \n\nThe bride was slammed all over social media and now the groom is saying he is single.", "YTA in big fluorescent letters.", "YTA but not for being let down about not having alcohol, but for saying what you said to the bride. I get it, if my husband and I went through the trouble of getting a babysitter, a hotel room and an Uber and then we got to the wedding to find out there was no drinks, I would be irritated too. HOWEVER, I would NEVER say anything except nice things to the bride and groom and I would graciously eat dinner, celebrate with their sorry sober asses and then go drinking with my husband  where we would laugh about how damn boring the reception was haha. But I would NEVER have said anything to anyone because that\u2019s rude as hell. That\u2019s why YTA. If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say don\u2019t say anything at all.", "INFO:  did the wedding invitation and/or program list a \"cocktail hour\" or was that just your expectation?", "Bruh, I have a straight-up drinking problem, and even I think YTA.", "YTA\n\nAlcohol seems to be WAY too big of a priority in your life. Attending the wedding of a close friend is about supporting them and helping them celebrate one of the best days of their life (hopefully), not an excuse to get butthoused on free booze.\n\nIf booze is so fucking important to you that you literally plan your life around it, YOU could have reached out to your friend and ask them if they recommended getting a hotel, Ubering etc.\n\nI feel sorry for your friend and his new wife for having to put up with your shitty attitude on their wedding day.", "Although ESH a little, you should never say something like that during someone's most STRESSFUL day.  ESH bc there should've been a heads up that there was no alcohol, but saying you might not have gone DURING the reception... That's rude.  \n\nIt's not all about you.  You're not wrong complaining, but your wife is correct in that your timing was terrible.  \n\nWhat would've worked is if you guys ate, then politely bowed out.", "YTA. The bride\u2019s family has no obligation to cover alcohol for a wedding (particularly when they don\u2019t drink and it raises the price SIGNIFICANTLY) nor do they owe you \u201cadvanced warning\u201d that you won\u2019t have booze. It would have been prudent on *your* end to text your friend in advance to see if alcohol would be served and simply state that you want to plan accordingly. Generally an invite will also *state* if booze is involved, but if it didn\u2019t, you could have inquired instead of assuming *they* wanted to serve alcohol at *their* wedding. \n\nYou didn\u2019t read the invite or ask the correct questions and spent a lot of money on an assumption. Then, when you realized you were wrong, you lashed out at the couple *during their wedding* and were rude enough to say that you may not have attended at all had you known you wouldn\u2019t get drinks. WTF? What kind of friend would miss their buddy\u2019s *wedding* over *alcohol*? If you don\u2019t have a drinking problem, you have a \u201cpoor manners\u201d problem. \n\nYou are, unquestionably, TA, a horrible friend, and a tactless jerk to insult someone *at their wedding.*", "You basically said .. I only come to drink. Without alcohol, you are wasting my time.", "YTA because you and your wife sound like the type of people who go to weddings and take advantage of free alcohol instead of celebrating the event.", "YTA, their wedding, their way. The most AH is not asking why there\u2019s no booze but throwing a fit about how much money you spent on an Uber. It\u2019s Uber, not a stretch limo you paid for", "YTA. Weddings are for celebrating friends and family getting married to the person they want to spend their life with. If you just wanted to get drunk with friends, go to a bar", "So a wedding is not about celebrating a milestone with your friend,  it's about catching a buzz? Are you sure you're not 17? If drinking is the main point of attending an event maybe stay home and go to a local bar instead.", "YTA, and you were dead wrong.  You assumed there\u2019d be booze.  I\u2019ve been to plenty of booze free weddings, it\u2019s not uncommon.  Bitching about it was low class and childish.", "YTA, you can't abstain from alcohol for an evening for your friend's wedding? I understand being disappointed that there wasn't any, but pissed? If you HAVE to have alcohol at every social event or you get pissed...you may have a drinking problem. This evening wasn't about getting drunk, it was about celebrating your friend's wedding, and if you can't be happy for him when you're sober, what kind of friend are you?", "YTA\n\nYou made these plans around cantering the wedding around getting drunk, that was your assumption. It's a wedding not a night out with the boys. You can say he should have told you, but just as easily you should have asked. Don't make your assumptions about someone else's wedding and their expenses their problem.", "This is why you have to let people know if your not serving alcohol. Your guests might spend a lot of money on hotels and Uber.", "YTA- That\u2019s one of your best friends? Sounds to me like alcohol is your best friend. It\u2019s one thing to be like oh damn well wish I would have known but many happy wishes to my supposed bestie and bride. But you had a whole hissy. Like a hissy enough to be kicked out.  Of course you\u2019re the asshole. You could have survived a few hours without being drunk. And if you can\u2019t, you have a problem.", "I was understanding about the added cost until you said you might not come... YTA\n\nThis is not your friend if you do not want to go to their wedding without alcohol. That is a drinking buddy.", "ESH. They should've made it clear so people could make reasonable provisions, you were equally out of line to confront them about it in the moment, have a bit of grace and let them have their wedding without arguments.", "YTA. The fact that you couldn't make it through one of your *best friend's weddings* without booze sure makes it sound like you have a drinking problem. Not only that, but the way you spoke to his wife was out of line. What's wrong with you?", "YTA - this isn't YOUR wedding bud. And the bride's parents have every right to decide what they are willing to pay for. IDK a lot of people bring flasks or airplane bottles to weddings for reasons like this. Booze was such a big deal to you, you missed one of your best friend's biggest days. Also, a booze free wedding tends to end early. You could have gone out with your group afterwards. No need to pitch a fit in front of the hosts, makes you seem really childish.", "YTA. However, the bride and  groom made the mistake of inviting someone they thought was a friend to the wedding.", "I always think it's an asshole move to get mad that there's no alcohol at a wedding. Itsnot THAT big of a deal. I do agree they should have let people know. But still....", "bro you sound like a freakin alcoholic\u2026 BIG yikes. your \u201cbest friend\u201d needs better friends\u2026", "\ud83d\udcaf YTA", "YTA but I'm sure your ex-best friend is glad to know what's important to you.", "I'm probably in the minority here, but YTA. Sure, they could have been considerate and sensitive to the fact that most people would expect alcohol and let everyone know ahead of time so they could accordingly. But they're not obligated to provide alcohol. I would have said N A H since you and the couple obviously had different expectations for what a wedding should have, but you became TA when you voiced your complaints to the couple. It's fair to be disappointed, but voicing the disappointment to the couple during the event is rude. Especially since you go on to say that you might not have even come to the event if you knew there was no alcohol. Is that the only reason you go? Is it not important to go to support your friend? I've been to plenty of wedding that were lame or not to my taste, but I would never say anything to the couple because the important part is that I am there to celebrate their big day with them the way they want to.\n\nOf course this is my opinion as someone that drinks socially, but is not much of a drinker. Maybe folks that go harder at weddings feel differently I don't know.", "You're not TA for being annoyed - they should have stated up front on the invitations that it would be a dry wedding. But telling the couple \"well, you should have told me because I might not have bothered coming!\" was an AH move. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You seem to have known ahead of time that she doesn\u2019t drink. It shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise that they didn\u2019t supply it. I can understand being upset about spending money on Uber but you could have pulled your friend aside and discretely asked him about the lack of booze during \u201ccocktail hour.\u201d  Friend\u2019s wedding didn\u2019t serve alcohol because they were paying for it themselves & both sides had family members who would have taken full advantage of it. They wanted to enjoy their day. Everyone in the friend group who wanted to drink did so after the reception at the hotel where we were all staying. Even the Bride and Groom hung out for awhile and had a few drinks.", "ESH. Them for not informing everyone ahead of time. You for complaining to the bride and groom almost immediately after they enter their reception.", "YTA and completely lacking in basic manners. You should be embarrassed with yourself.", "I think YTA, why would you say something like that to them on their wedding day? You could\u2019ve just gotten some drinks after.", "YTA. Honestly this was a really inappropriate reaction over some alcohol and response to the bride and groom. It\u2019s alcohol. You\u2019ll live.", "YTA. You literally insinuated that the only reason you came was for alcohol when you stated that you may not have even come to the wedding had you known that it was a dry wedding. This is your friend?? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "You wouldn't have bothered showing up if you had known there would be no booze......\n\nSuper shitty to tell that to the bride and groom...you're best friend....\n\nYou have problems.\n\nYTA", "I agree with your wife.  You aren't wrong for being upset but during the celebration was not the time to bring it up.  You should have tried to make the best of the situation and enjoy as best you could and maybe bring it up later that you would have appreciated a heads up that there wouldn't be alcohol and that you wouldn't have needed to waste money on ubers and a hotel.", "YTA. I don\u2019t even think an apology can fix your friendship. You suck.", "YTA... you go to a wedding to celebrate the couple... if you get hammered, it is a bonus...\n\nMaybe next time, how about you find a microbrewery near the venue and then go get drunk AFTER an gour at the reception...", "YTA for being an adult and not being able to handle your drinks.", "YTA.\n\nWhy couldn't you have been gracious to the couple getting married, enjoyed the meal and dessert, danced a little, and then discreetly left and found a bar with your friends who wanted to get trashed?\n\nIf you all spent money for a hotel room you could have easily ended up back at the hotel bar and had a couple later in the evening.\n\nThere was no need to say anything and that fact that you basically told \"one of your best friends\" that you probably wouldn't have even bothered to attend his wedding had you known there would not be alcohol absolutely does indicate that you have a bit of an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.\n\nYou're not the asshole for wanting to drink at a wedding and being disappointed you weren't served what you wanted, but you are absolutely the asshole for how you expressed that/ getting angry over it.\n\nThere was a gracious way to pivot and be flexible with your plans while still celebrating your friend who was getting married.\n\nApologize to your friend and his wife. Don't be surprised if you find that you're no longer close friends with him. You were profoundly rude.\n\nBTW, you might want to consider whether you and your friend group are precisely the reason they didn't think having a little champagne at the wedding would still go over okay with her family. The fact that you were this rude sober makes me shudder to think how you would have behaved around people who are less alcohol tolerant with enough drinks in you to necessitate that uber.", "ESH. They should have made it clear that it would be a dry wedding exactly because of the expense involved in planning for a night involving drinking. You should have held your tongue because there was nothing to be done about it in the moment.\n\nI remember the old stories about certain members of my family members waiting to see what the place and dinner were like before putting money in the gift envelope.

I know dudes aren't gonna sit and talk about the wedding planning, but you think that might've come up.\n\nCould the couple have said on the invitations that it would be a dry reception? Sure, they could've, and personally, I would've.\n\nRegardless, strictly because of the way you reacted and presented it, YTA.", "I mean there's nothing inherently wrong with being disappointed, but YTA for making it someone else's problem. \n\nYou're a whole entire adult, telling someone *on their wedding day* that you're mad they aren't paying for you to get shitfaced.

At their wedding? Not appropriate.", "YTA. Not for expecting the alcohol, as it is quite common for weddings to have it, but for your immature and self-centered complaint. It\u2019s your *best friend\u2019s* wedding. It\u2019s *his* day. You literally told your best friend that you value alcohol more than your friendship by implying you might not have even come if you\u2019d known. \n\nOP, you *will* survive without alcohol. Will you survive without your best friend?\n\nIs it kinda shitty that you spent money expecting something that ended up not being true? Yeah.

Or you invited your friends to drink in his honor. Or *anything*!\n\nListen, to be quite blunt, while I am *not* your therapist, I highly advise not dismissing the newlywed bride\u2019s words so quickly and truly reevaluating your relationship with alcohol.

I\u2019d be surprised if the wedding hasn\u2019t been a topic of conversation, how is everyone getting there, where are the staying, sharing rides to and from and so forth) and will have riled up at least two thirds of their guests, have kind of brought it on themselves.\n\nAll you need to do is be honest, and then you\u2019re automatically not assholes.", "The presence of alcohol at a wedding is not an \"added surprise\" when the groom regularly meets up with friends at a brewery. An open bar may be an added surprise, but not the alcohol itself.", "Every time I see this POV it absolutely perplexes me. If a couple wants a wedding to only be about themselves, then they have the option of eloping, by themselves. If they choose instead for their wedding to be a party to celebrate and share their love, then surely they want to take their guests into account, to ensure that they have a good time? Otherwise what's the point?", "It\u2019s not about it being the only thing.\n\nBut there\u2019s a reasonable expectation of being able to let loose, and so people plan for that. Confronting the couple was wrong, but I\u2019d have been annoyed to fork out extra for hotels etc and find out the evening was sober and finished at 8pm.", "> if alcohol is there it\u2019s an added surprise.\n\nNo, that isn't realistic, and you should know that.  People are not wrong here to say that MOST PEOPLE will expect alcohol to be served at a wedding. It's not a \"surprise\" if it is. It's a big surprise if it's NOT.  Unless of course there are mitigating circumstances (based on religion, or other cultural factors that you would know ahead of time).\n\nIn particular -- if your relationship with the bride or groom is one of regular outings to breweries, then it's completely reasonable to assume that that guy will have alcohol at his wedding.  Even if his wife doesn't drink -- that doesn't automatically mean \"dry wedding\", it just means \"wife won't be partaking of alcoholic drinks\".\n\nNow, the thing is -- I'm NOT actually extending this argument to \"guests expect a wedding to be an event where they can go get drunk\". I don't care about that.  Neither my family nor my friend group has ever been that way about alcohol.  Drink socially, yes.  Consider getting drunk to be a party goal?  No.  But, it's from that perspective where I'm STILL saying, the default expectation is at least beer/wine at a wedding reception, and it would be considered unusual for there not to be any, unless you knew of particular reasons for there not to be.\n\nAll that said -- the question of whether people want there to be alcohol at a wedding so they can get recreationally drunk or not actually doesn't have any bearing on this situation.\n\nThe crux of the issue here is one where OP's objection is actually a little bit reasonable.  If you're a responsible person, then yeah, if you expect to be having a few drinks over the course of a wedding reception, you make arrangements so that you don't have to drive afterwards.  Him saying that they only got the hotel room and Uber in anticipation of not being able to drive later makes sense. (And, \"not being able to drive later\" doesn't mean \"because he expected to get blackout drunk\" -- even having a couple of beers means you shouldn't be driving later.)  \n\nWhere OP is a huge asshole is in making a scene, and the whole petulant line about \"maybe I wouldn't have attended at all\". Come on, man.  You're an asshole for that, and you should know it.  That level of petulance was uncalled for.\n\nI'd be more inclined to go with ESH for this, because frankly -- the groom should have given his friends a heads-up that it would be dry.  \\*Because\\* his relationship with his friends involves outings where they drink, and because I find it hard to believe that this friend group didn't talk about the arrangements they were making for attending, and why.  OP does have a right to be irritated that he spent a good chunk of money that he didn't need to, and wouldn't have spent had he known he didn't need to.\n\nHe just doesn't have so much of a right to be irritated, that his making a scene was at all warranted.", "The fact that you just off the cuff go to alcoholism, and accuse it so carelessly, proves you\u2019re an asshole.\n\nAnything after that is moot, because at that point I disregard your opinion and consider it worthless, and don\u2019t bother wasting my time reading the rest of your schlock.", "Lmao you are really acting like there\u2019s no middle ground between full blown alcoholism and alcohol there as an \u201cadded surprise\u201d.

Weddings tend to have a lot of people that have absolutely nothing in common other than knowing the bride and groom. There is only so much small talk that will get you through. Alcohol allows people to loosen up and ignore how much everyone else around them grates on them.

What is it with assuming anyone who likes a drink is an alcoholic?! For heavens sakes. This holier than thou attitude towards drinking really pisses me off.", "Seems like the bride and groom are the alcoholics as they figured no one would show if they put on the invites they were going to have a dry wedding.", "So having a drink or two is getting drunk now?", "You can\u2019t be a real person.", "you sound like a blast at weddings.", "The horse is high with this one ^", "I disagree, I do think drinking shouldn't be the only reason, nor should it be the primary reason, but it is a reasonable secondary reason.", "Can we be super honest?

Buy me a drink if you want me to sit for your lames ass commitment announcement.", "> if alcohol is there it\u2019s an added surprise.\n\nFound the wife from OP\u2019s story. Are you telling us you are genuinely surprised every time you see alcohol at a wedding?", "I see what you did there!", "Hey, now, maybe they're onto something. I'm going through the rest of my life expecting fresh burr-ground espresso lungo pulls with steamed oat milk and freshly grated nutmeg at any and all places I am expected to appear.\n\nObviously, we just get to expect shit for free for attending things, and then be vocally pissed when we don't get it. Mine is snotty, overpriced caffeine, but I like it, and my comfort is the only thing that counts! ^^/s\n\nThese people are really bending themselves into pretzels trying to explain how expecting free alcohol at a wedding like their RSVP had a fucking rider attached is normative, reasonable, and not a sign of an alcohol dependency problem. \"BUT IT IS A SOCIAL FUNCTION AND I CAN'T BE SOCIAL WITHOUT ALCOHOL SO?\" Betty Ford has some shit to say about that, friends. *Depending on alcohol to enjoy or participate in social events is a major indicator of a substance use disorder.* That's just facts, but apparently those are rather unpopular tonight.

I think because I NEVER had it, I just didn't know what I was missing. I was always able to have fun and be social without it. And I also saw how terrible my friends felt the next day. We'd stay up all night and I'd feel bad just from being tired. I couldn't imagine feeling worse than that. Lol. \n\nPeople often think that because I am very firm in my pledge to never drink or do drugs, that I'm against others doing it. I never judge others for it. I know there can be a healthy way to consume substances. I just don't trust myself. Addiction and mental illness run pretty heavily in my family. I have definitely inherited the mental illness so I have to assume I got the addiction too. I can't get addicted if I never do it.

He knows that HIS friend group socializes by going to breweries. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that they'd expect him to have, AT LEAST, a good craft beer selection at the wedding.  That's his THING.  His wife not being a drinker doesn't automatically mean she objects to other people drinking.\n\nOnce he knew her family was paying for things and wouldn't pay for alcohol, he should either have thought about paying for (at least) beer himself, or, given his friends / his side of the family a heads-up that it would be dry.\n\nOP is still an asshole, though, because from what he's reporting here, what he said was over the top.  (And also, not REALLY the right time/place to argue about it.)\n\n(Though, I do sympathize with OP's point that he would have saved money on the hotel room and Uber, if he'd known he didn't need it.  I have a feeling that the \"I might not have come\" thing was more in the heat of the moment due to the frustration of spending a chunk of money he didn't have to.

If you want a marriage, go to a local courthouse and be done with it on the cheap.\n\nThis is \"all about the bride and groom\" nonsense is how you end up with bride and groomzillas who think that they can command everything they possibly want down to the underwear guests wear bwvause it's  \"their day\".", "It\u2019s the kind of thing you grumble about with friends once or twice the next time you see them in a \u201cthat was kind of a weird move on their part\u201d way if you absolutely feel the need to complain to someone.", "That\u2019s actually a really excellent point lmao", "someone\u2019s a fun host", "It\u2019s funny that you call it alcoholism. I am an alcoholic but I know for a fact that people go to weddings to let their hair Dow , dance, drink, and have fun. You are the wettest blanket I\u2019ve ever seen and again, I am sober and would be expecting my guests to want alcohol. The fact that they omitted that is just sheisty.", "Where in Mormonstan do you live. The norm everywhere except Muslim and some Uber religious societies, alcohol is part of most normal celebrations. If the bride and family don't drink, then don't fucking drink. Simple really. Nothing says congratulations buddy like the clinking of glasses of sparkling water.", "Very few people care about another person\u2019s wedding enough to spend hours and hours focused \u201conly about the couple\u201d. Many people don\u2019t enjoy events where they know only some or none of the other guests, so the literal only thing they can enjoy is food and, yes, drink.\n\nWeddings are and have always been social events that involve eating, drinking, dancing, and a bit of time celebrating the couple. And part of a good wedding is being a good host and providing a good experience to your guests. Those are the priorities that need to be in check.", ">Irrespective of your alcoholism\n\nYou know occasionally getting drunk and finding that fun doesn't make you an alcoholic, right?", "Regardless of why he said it, the fact remains he said it. That's going to put a significant dent into the friendship with his so-called best friend.", "> A wedding is essentially a party from the guest perspective,\n\nBingo! No one would want to spend the time and money on nice clothes, getting dressed up, and potentially driving for a long time and/or booking a hotel just to watch the couple say 'I do' and kiss without a party.\n\nIn most, if not all, of the weddings I've been to, no one actually looked forward to the ceremony part. It's kind of just seen as an obligatory \"watching paint dry\" that you suffer through before you get to let loose and have fun. It's also totally possible that normal people do look forward to it and my family is just dysfunctional, idk.", "There\u2019s some puritan twats on here", "> Wedding receptions are to celebrate the couple, but good hosts always take their guests into consideration.\n\ni think this is a part that a lot of wedding posts in this sub forget. a good host is looking out for their guests, not just themselves. a wedding is a celebration, a gathering of family and friends. just ask yourself what would Jesus do? would he turn water into wine for his guests, or tell them it's a dry wedding? \n\nso the bride's family doesn't drink, and chose not to pay for alcohol. that's their call, they're footing the bill. \n\nbut it is typical and expected for alcohol to be available at parties and social gatherings. if you decide to have a dry wedding, that's cool too, but let people know. also, don't be surprised if people dip out early to go get a drink or two.", "There are absolutely weddings I wouldn\u2019t attend if they were dry. Not my best friend\u2019s, but it\u2019s not some sign of crippling alcoholism if you don\u2019t want to go to a 5+ hour engagement with small talk and dancing if there\u2019s no booze.", "Your dad would tell you to stop being an idiot and bring the booze :D (atleast in lithuania)", "Additionally, letting guests know there would be no alcohol provided, or served, could have let the guests bring their own depending on the venue. I\u2019ve seen groomsmen sneak in flasks to dry weddings.", "Agreed ESH.\n\nCouple for hiding the lack of alcohol\n\nOP for not being able to hold in his discontent for a night to at least let his \"friend\" and wife have their moment. And feeling a need to add in that he might not have come at all had he known there was no alcohol. That seemed quite petty.", "I prefer the term problem drinking, it encompasses so much more and it doesn't have to be a full blown chronic addiction to still be problematic. Labeling someone as an alcoholic based on your perception of their drinking habits is a bit off base, but acknowledging that their relationship to alcohol, or other substances, is having an impact that is detrimental in some way is healthy to recognize in yourself and in others. I am pro substances, with moderation and responsible use and I don't think just because someone uses something it makes them an addict, but if there is something fishy about their use, like being a dick to your supposed best friend because you don't get to get plastered on a day meant to celebrate his love, that is a problem."]}
