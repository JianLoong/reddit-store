While I do believe this type of thing should be announced beforehand, you saying you might not have even come to the bride and groom is beyond the pale.

Why did you even bring this up *at their wedding* to the bride? You shot yourself in the foot with that one.", "YTA; the point of weddings is to celebrate the couple, not to get smashed.", "YTA.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have even gone if there wasn\u2019t booze? \n\nYeah. YTA.", "YTA. The part where you implied that you might not have come if you had known that there was no alcohol was what put it over the top. You were right about all of the other points, but maybe save that for the groom at a later time if you really felt the need to criticize.", "Silly of your friend for thinking you'd want to attend their wedding to share their celebration, not so you could get drunk. YTA", "YTA. And you seem to have an alcohol problem.", "We didn't have alcohol, dinner, or dancing at our wedding. However, the invitation specifically stated \"cake and punch reception in the fellowship hall immediately following.\" Since the wedding (and subsequent reception) were in a church, I don't think anybody expected there to be alcohol.", "YTA\n\nThe last thing you ever do is criticize somebody about their wedding. You have no idea the amount of planning that goes into it. Unless you are paying for it, keep your mouth shut, and do your best to enjoy the ceremony, or don\u2019t go at all .\n\nThis wedding is about them, not you and your alcohol.", "YTA. If you did not like it, you should have just come up with a polite excuse and left. If you really felt the need to complain, you could have done that later and NOT at the actual wedding. Who throws a fit about not being able to drink for a few hours?! (And in case you are wondering, I have nothing against alcohol and I am a social drinker myself).", "YTA! It\u2019s their wedding, drinking is not the point of the celebration.

You griped about lack of alcohol to the bride and groom during their own wedding reception? And then said you might not have come if you\u2019d known there wouldn\u2019t be booze? Yeah, if booze at a wedding matters more to you than being there for one of your \u201cbest friends,\u201d you are definitely the AH, and it also makes me skeptical about your claims that you don\u2019t have a drinking problem.", "ESH. It doesn't sound like the upset is so much about the lack of alcohol, but the fact that he (and others) spent unnecessarily on Ubers and hotel because this fact was not communicated. The words chosen were poor and it's not nice to say that you might not have come while at the reception. \n\nThat said, people really should have a heads up if it will be a dry wedding. Don't list something as cocktail hour if there are no cocktails. Should say something like \"Social hour. Sodas will be served\"", "ESH- dry weddings are not unheard of, but they are not the norm. This should be announced when invitations are sent out. I\u2019m sure you weren\u2019t the only person who spent unnecessary money thinking you would be unable to drive.\n\nI get that it might have annoyed you. It would have annoyed me too. But having this altercation with the couple on their wedding day was not the time or place.", "YTA\n\n>I would have just driven if i'd known or maybe not even had come.\n\nSounds like you just wouldn't have come. The fact that not coming to support your friend's wedding is an option for you - is so telling. \n\nYou can have a grievance. Air it out with your friend, privately after he gets back from honeymoon. Or work out your feelings at the bar after the wedding.  Drinking isn't a wedding requirement.", "YTA. I agree that they should have told people the wedding would be dry. But that\u2019s not an excuse for you to be rude to the couple on their wedding day. Sometimes you get invited to an event and it\u2019s not what you hoped. Unless you\u2019re literally like, attacked by the hosts, you don\u2019t go up to them and complain.\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for throwing a bad party. You ARE an asshole for marching up to a couple that just got married and whining that they didn\u2019t provide you booze.", "YTA, but this sounds like a major red flag.  If you\u2019re that hung up on booze, you might have a problem.", "YTA\nIf you cannot go without alcohol for one night, you are an alcoholic. Also, if alcohol matters more to you than celebrating your friend's wedding, you aren't a very good friend.", "YTA. It was not your wedding. Her family paid for the wedding and they do not drink. If you and and your friends wanted to grab a drink after the reception ypu could do that. It is kinda sad you could not go 2-3 hours without drinking or not be able to enjoy a free meal without drinking.  You were rude to the bride as well.", ">The bride does not take my commentary well and implies I might have a drinking problem\n\nShe might be on to something here", "YTA. While I too would have been annoyed, you acted really rude and entitled at their celebration. It wasn't the time or place", "YTA.   \n\n\nIf alcohol is absolutely necessary for you to enjoy yourself at a wedding, then you should do the work of verifying it will be available. Since it will factor so heavily into your decision to attend...", "YTA. It\u2019s not your wedding. Be a good friend and just be there to celebrate your buddy\u2019s marriage. Sometimes you gotta eat an L for the homies. All you did was project your L onto him. Not a good friend move.", "YTA for saying what you said, when you said it. I get being pissed about spending money when it wasn\u2019t necessary and they should have mentioned to people it was a dry reception. BUT you were a jerk to have brought it up at the actual wedding. And not a great friend for saying you wouldn\u2019t have come had you known. Eww.", "YTA\n\nYour not paying for the wedding/reception you have NO SAY!  When the alcoholics in my family go to a dry wedding if the reception is in a hotel they make several bar trips. Funerals are always dry and they head to a bar right after. If you absolutely needed a drink, you and your drinking friends could have left after dinner and gone to a bar you didn't have to be the AH at their reception.", "YTA. If you're that angry over no alcohol (to the point where you suggest you wouldn't have even attended if you'd known), it's entirely possible you *do* have a drinking problem.", "YTA. No one told you and your wife to book a hotel room and take Ubers. How was this couple supposed to know that you were financially invested in getting drunk at their wedding? I agree that they should have informed guests in advance that they were having a dry wedding but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to confront them about it at their wedding reception. The fact that you said you would have consider not attending if you knew there wouldn\u2019t be booze shows that you aren\u2019t really their friend. You can get drunk any time so the opportunity to see one of your best friends get married should mean more to you than alcohol. I hope you enjoy your friendship with this guy because it\u2019s probably over now.", "Maybe he\u2019s one of your \u201cbest friends\u201d but I hope for his sake you aren\u2019t one of his. I hope every other friend he has is better than you. YTA.", "YTA. I could understand being a little disappointed, but to actually be *angry* there wasn\u2019t alcohol?  I agree with the bride, you might have a problem.", "ESH. \n\nGentle AH to the bride and groom for not specifying on the invite that it would be a dry wedding. At the absolute minimum your mate should have spread the word to his side of the guestlist that the wedding is dry at the wife\u2019s family\u2019s request because he would have known the guests would expect it. \n\nBigger AH is the OP for actually saying this to the bride and groom DURING THE RECEPTION like a f*cking moron. Then going on to say that he wouldn\u2019t have come? That\u2019s either an exaggeration, a troll, or he\u2019s going to have to find some new friends.", "YTA. Yes, it\u2019s considered courteous to let guests know about a dry wedding ahead of time because, as you said, people do make plans and safety accommodations based on having alcohol. If all you\u2019d done was note that to your friends, no foul. It\u2019s an annoyance. \n\nTelling one of your \u201cbest\u201d friends that *you might not have come to his WEDDING* just because you weren\u2019t going to be able to get drunk is rude as shit. And it\u2019s definitely not an indication that you have a GREAT relationship with alcohol. Literally saying that celebrating your friend\u2019s life milestone is ruined by not being able to get plastered during it\u2026 not exactly good. You have some apologizing and some soul searching to do.", "I hate dry weddings. I feel ya. I usually avoid them unless I\u2019m actually really close to the individual.", "NTA I don't even drink for my own reasons and I think not telling people that it's a dry wedding is absolutely absurd. \n\nMy husband and I went to a wedding and we paid for a hotel room as did many other people as to not wanting to drink & drive.\nMany people to let loose and have a good time And they were upset over the fact it was a dry event.\n\nAbout 3/4 of the guests left when they found out. And took thier gifts back. \n\nThe bride was slammed all over social media and now the groom is saying he is single.", "YTA in big fluorescent letters.", "YTA but not for being let down about not having alcohol, but for saying what you said to the bride. I get it, if my husband and I went through the trouble of getting a babysitter, a hotel room and an Uber and then we got to the wedding to find out there was no drinks, I would be irritated too. HOWEVER, I would NEVER say anything except nice things to the bride and groom and I would graciously eat dinner, celebrate with their sorry sober asses and then go drinking with my husband  where we would laugh about how damn boring the reception was haha. But I would NEVER have said anything to anyone because that\u2019s rude as hell. That\u2019s why YTA. If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say don\u2019t say anything at all.", "INFO:  did the wedding invitation and/or program list a \"cocktail hour\" or was that just your expectation?", "Bruh, I have a straight-up drinking problem, and even I think YTA.", "YTA\n\nAlcohol seems to be WAY too big of a priority in your life. Attending the wedding of a close friend is about supporting them and helping them celebrate one of the best days of their life (hopefully), not an excuse to get butthoused on free booze.\n\nIf booze is so fucking important to you that you literally plan your life around it, YOU could have reached out to your friend and ask them if they recommended getting a hotel, Ubering etc.\n\nI feel sorry for your friend and his new wife for having to put up with your shitty attitude on their wedding day.", "Although ESH a little, you should never say something like that during someone's most STRESSFUL day.  ESH bc there should've been a heads up that there was no alcohol, but saying you might not have gone DURING the reception... That's rude.  \n\nIt's not all about you.  You're not wrong complaining, but your wife is correct in that your timing was terrible.  \n\nWhat would've worked is if you guys ate, then politely bowed out.", "YTA. The bride\u2019s family has no obligation to cover alcohol for a wedding (particularly when they don\u2019t drink and it raises the price SIGNIFICANTLY) nor do they owe you \u201cadvanced warning\u201d that you won\u2019t have booze. It would have been prudent on *your* end to text your friend in advance to see if alcohol would be served and simply state that you want to plan accordingly. Generally an invite will also *state* if booze is involved, but if it didn\u2019t, you could have inquired instead of assuming *they* wanted to serve alcohol at *their* wedding. \n\nYou didn\u2019t read the invite or ask the correct questions and spent a lot of money on an assumption. Then, when you realized you were wrong, you lashed out at the couple *during their wedding* and were rude enough to say that you may not have attended at all had you known you wouldn\u2019t get drinks. WTF? What kind of friend would miss their buddy\u2019s *wedding* over *alcohol*? If you don\u2019t have a drinking problem, you have a \u201cpoor manners\u201d problem. \n\nYou are, unquestionably, TA, a horrible friend, and a tactless jerk to insult someone *at their wedding.*", "You basically said .. I only come to drink. Without alcohol, you are wasting my time.", "YTA because you and your wife sound like the type of people who go to weddings and take advantage of free alcohol instead of celebrating the event.", "YTA, their wedding, their way. The most AH is not asking why there\u2019s no booze but throwing a fit about how much money you spent on an Uber. It\u2019s Uber, not a stretch limo you paid for", "YTA. Weddings are for celebrating friends and family getting married to the person they want to spend their life with. If you just wanted to get drunk with friends, go to a bar", "So a wedding is not about celebrating a milestone with your friend,  it's about catching a buzz? Are you sure you're not 17? If drinking is the main point of attending an event maybe stay home and go to a local bar instead.", "YTA, and you were dead wrong.  You assumed there\u2019d be booze.  I\u2019ve been to plenty of booze free weddings, it\u2019s not uncommon.  Bitching about it was low class and childish.", "YTA, you can't abstain from alcohol for an evening for your friend's wedding? I understand being disappointed that there wasn't any, but pissed? If you HAVE to have alcohol at every social event or you get pissed...you may have a drinking problem. This evening wasn't about getting drunk, it was about celebrating your friend's wedding, and if you can't be happy for him when you're sober, what kind of friend are you?", "YTA\n\nYou made these plans around cantering the wedding around getting drunk, that was your assumption. It's a wedding not a night out with the boys. You can say he should have told you, but just as easily you should have asked. Don't make your assumptions about someone else's wedding and their expenses their problem.", "This is why you have to let people know if your not serving alcohol. Your guests might spend a lot of money on hotels and Uber.", "YTA- That\u2019s one of your best friends? Sounds to me like alcohol is your best friend. It\u2019s one thing to be like oh damn well wish I would have known but many happy wishes to my supposed bestie and bride. But you had a whole hissy. Like a hissy enough to be kicked out.  Of course you\u2019re the asshole. You could have survived a few hours without being drunk. And if you can\u2019t, you have a problem.", "I was understanding about the added cost until you said you might not come... YTA\n\nThis is not your friend if you do not want to go to their wedding without alcohol. That is a drinking buddy.", "ESH. They should've made it clear so people could make reasonable provisions, you were equally out of line to confront them about it in the moment, have a bit of grace and let them have their wedding without arguments.", "YTA. The fact that you couldn't make it through one of your *best friend's weddings* without booze sure makes it sound like you have a drinking problem. Not only that, but the way you spoke to his wife was out of line. What's wrong with you?", "YTA - this isn't YOUR wedding bud. And the bride's parents have every right to decide what they are willing to pay for. IDK a lot of people bring flasks or airplane bottles to weddings for reasons like this. Booze was such a big deal to you, you missed one of your best friend's biggest days. Also, a booze free wedding tends to end early. You could have gone out with your group afterwards. No need to pitch a fit in front of the hosts, makes you seem really childish.", "YTA. However, the bride and  groom made the mistake of inviting someone they thought was a friend to the wedding.", "I always think it's an asshole move to get mad that there's no alcohol at a wedding. Itsnot THAT big of a deal. I do agree they should have let people know. But still....", "bro you sound like a freakin alcoholic\u2026 BIG yikes. your \u201cbest friend\u201d needs better friends\u2026", "\ud83d\udcaf YTA", "YTA but I'm sure your ex-best friend is glad to know what's important to you.", "I'm probably in the minority here, but YTA. Sure, they could have been considerate and sensitive to the fact that most people would expect alcohol and let everyone know ahead of time so they could accordingly. But they're not obligated to provide alcohol. I would have said N A H since you and the couple obviously had different expectations for what a wedding should have, but you became TA when you voiced your complaints to the couple. It's fair to be disappointed, but voicing the disappointment to the couple during the event is rude. Especially since you go on to say that you might not have even come to the event if you knew there was no alcohol. Is that the only reason you go? Is it not important to go to support your friend? I've been to plenty of wedding that were lame or not to my taste, but I would never say anything to the couple because the important part is that I am there to celebrate their big day with them the way they want to.\n\nOf course this is my opinion as someone that drinks socially, but is not much of a drinker. Maybe folks that go harder at weddings feel differently I don't know.", "You're not TA for being annoyed - they should have stated up front on the invitations that it would be a dry wedding. But telling the couple \"well, you should have told me because I might not have bothered coming!\" was an AH move. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You seem to have known ahead of time that she doesn\u2019t drink. It shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise that they didn\u2019t supply it. I can understand being upset about spending money on Uber but you could have pulled your friend aside and discretely asked him about the lack of booze during \u201ccocktail hour.\u201d  Friend\u2019s wedding didn\u2019t serve alcohol because they were paying for it themselves & both sides had family members who would have taken full advantage of it. They wanted to enjoy their day. Everyone in the friend group who wanted to drink did so after the reception at the hotel where we were all staying. Even the Bride and Groom hung out for awhile and had a few drinks.", "ESH. Them for not informing everyone ahead of time. You for complaining to the bride and groom almost immediately after they enter their reception.", "YTA and completely lacking in basic manners. You should be embarrassed with yourself.", "I think YTA, why would you say something like that to them on their wedding day? You could\u2019ve just gotten some drinks after.", "YTA. Honestly this was a really inappropriate reaction over some alcohol and response to the bride and groom. It\u2019s alcohol. You\u2019ll live.", "YTA. You literally insinuated that the only reason you came was for alcohol when you stated that you may not have even come to the wedding had you known that it was a dry wedding. This is your friend?? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "You wouldn't have bothered showing up if you had known there would be no booze......\n\nSuper shitty to tell that to the bride and groom...you're best friend....\n\nYou have problems.\n\nYTA", "I agree with your wife.  You aren't wrong for being upset but during the celebration was not the time to bring it up.  You should have tried to make the best of the situation and enjoy as best you could and maybe bring it up later that you would have appreciated a heads up that there wouldn't be alcohol and that you wouldn't have needed to waste money on ubers and a hotel.", "YTA. I don\u2019t even think an apology can fix your friendship. You suck.", "YTA... you go to a wedding to celebrate the couple... if you get hammered, it is a bonus...\n\nMaybe next time, how about you find a microbrewery near the venue and then go get drunk AFTER an gour at the reception...", "YTA for being an adult and not being able to handle your drinks.", "YTA.\n\nWhy couldn't you have been gracious to the couple getting married, enjoyed the meal and dessert, danced a little, and then discreetly left and found a bar with your friends who wanted to get trashed?\n\nIf you all spent money for a hotel room you could have easily ended up back at the hotel bar and had a couple later in the evening.\n\nThere was no need to say anything and that fact that you basically told \"one of your best friends\" that you probably wouldn't have even bothered to attend his wedding had you known there would not be alcohol absolutely does indicate that you have a bit of an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.\n\nYou're not the asshole for wanting to drink at a wedding and being disappointed you weren't served what you wanted, but you are absolutely the asshole for how you expressed that/ getting angry over it.\n\nThere was a gracious way to pivot and be flexible with your plans while still celebrating your friend who was getting married.\n\nApologize to your friend and his wife. Don't be surprised if you find that you're no longer close friends with him. You were profoundly rude.\n\nBTW, you might want to consider whether you and your friend group are precisely the reason they didn't think having a little champagne at the wedding would still go over okay with her family. The fact that you were this rude sober makes me shudder to think how you would have behaved around people who are less alcohol tolerant with enough drinks in you to necessitate that uber.", "ESH. They should have made it clear that it would be a dry wedding exactly because of the expense involved in planning for a night involving drinking. You should have held your tongue because there was nothing to be done about it in the moment.\n\nI remember the old stories about certain members of my family members waiting to see what the place and dinner were like before putting money in the gift envelope.

I know dudes aren't gonna sit and talk about the wedding planning, but you think that might've come up.\n\nCould the couple have said on the invitations that it would be a dry reception? Sure, they could've, and personally, I would've.\n\nRegardless, strictly because of the way you reacted and presented it, YTA.", "I mean there's nothing inherently wrong with being disappointed, but YTA for making it someone else's problem. \n\nYou're a whole entire adult, telling someone *on their wedding day* that you're mad they aren't paying for you to get shitfaced.

At their wedding? Not appropriate.", "YTA. Not for expecting the alcohol, as it is quite common for weddings to have it, but for your immature and self-centered complaint. It\u2019s your *best friend\u2019s* wedding. It\u2019s *his* day. You literally told your best friend that you value alcohol more than your friendship by implying you might not have even come if you\u2019d known. \n\nOP, you *will* survive without alcohol. Will you survive without your best friend?\n\nIs it kinda shitty that you spent money expecting something that ended up not being true? Yeah.

Very much yeah.\n\nYou took your best friend\u2019s big day and tried to make it about you.

Or you invited your friends to drink in his honor. Or *anything*!\n\nListen, to be quite blunt, while I am *not* your therapist, I highly advise not dismissing the newlywed bride\u2019s words so quickly and truly reevaluating your relationship with alcohol.

I love to drink and have a good time, but if I go somewhere and find out there isn\u2019t booze, I\u2019d still be happy to hang with my friends.", "The fact that you even tell on yourself by saying \"want to get drunk\" and not \"want to take the edge off\" or \"let loose\". \n\nYes, it's alcoholism if you *want* to get drunk.", "Sounds awful. \u201cCome stand in a hot reception hall in uncomfortable clothes with clich\u00e9 dance music from the early 2000s and too bright lights. Bring us gifts. But oh, there\u2019s no alcohol or food provided. You\u2019re here to celebrate US, right?!?!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t even drink but come on, even my cousin\u2019s courthouse room rental wedding with 8 guests had food.", "Did you know ahead of time there was no food or did they hold it during normal dining hours and let you show up expecting food", "I went to one like that. They only had a little cocktail with small appetizers that were not enough for all of us, and we were expected to be there all night long. Me and some cousins excused ourselves, went to a gas station nearby to eat some food because we were HUNGRY, and quickly came back. For days, it was a huge gossip that the food wasn\u2019t enough.", "The wedding had no food??? So what did you all do during the reception?", "Wow, what an exhaustive sample size! Truly your personal experiences in the first half of one year must be the universal norm!\n\nPerhaps that was too snarky, but this really isn't a debate. It is standard etiquette so that your guests know whether to bring money or to arrange for transportation, etc.", "I\u2019ve been to 4 wedding this year and 4 last year.  All but one was an open bar.", "Lol what?  How about being a good host to your guest.  At minimum notify guests there is no booze. The expectation at a wedding is that it will have alcohol.", "Was just responding to your question of what to call the cocktail hour at a dry wedding. \n\nWhile I agree that it should be clearly stated (dry, cash, byob for some small backyard ones, or open bar) on invites, I also think OP was being a massive AH for their comments to the couple. That was uncalled for, and wildly inappropriate.", "Why is the weed part not cool? You don\u2019t have to smoke it", "Why was the weed part not cool?", "I would have loved it there lol", "Yes, that's what I've been saying.         \nBut saying 'if I knew that I wouldn't have come' to them, on the day, was a bit much.", "They could have said \u201cmock tail hour\u201d so everyone was clear. They specifically misled people by calling it cocktail hour\u2026 NTA", "Same\u2026.I\u2019m Scottish \ud83d\ude02", "I agree, if I was him I wouldn\u2019t have brought it up during the wedding. But I agree more with the ESH votes than the YTA votes.", "Maybe the guy is just an asshole? This is the sub for that. But it\u2019s not alcoholism to be upset there isn\u2019t gonna be booze at wedding, just a heads up beforehand would be appreciated. It\u2019s not like that is asking for much, but I totally agree with everyone he was over the top with his comments and actions actually at the wedding.", "No, that is not alcoholism in and of itself. There are actual criteria that must be met to qualify for an alcohol use disorder; you can\u2019t just use \u201calcoholism\u201d for every questionable behaviour related to alcohol.", "That's not what they said. They said they could have driven had they known they'd be sober instead of spending $$$$ on a hotel and Uber", "What if you dont even normally drink but still like to get a little drunk at weddings? For non-alcoholics arent weddings one of the few socially acceptable situations to tie one on? \n\nI dont think ive had a drink in a week or three, but last time i actually got drunk was at a wedding.", "You need clinical help. I drink maybe once every two months, but yea I have alcoholism if one of those times is to get drunk at a wedding.", ">Yes, it's alcoholism if you want to get drunk.\n\nAs a social drinker, every now and then I want to get drunk.  I\"m not an alcoholic for that desire every now and then.", "Probably wished someone would pull the fire alarm tbh.", "Lol probably ordering UberEats \ud83d\ude06", "I think it's becoming more and more common for weddings to not have free booze. I've only been to weddings where you get one type of drink free (beer or a special premixed drink) and the rest is cash bar or only cash bar. Honestly a full open bar is becoming pretty antiquated at weddings at this point and I don't think many people who aren't older share your view from my experience. Maybe you should learn life isn't your way or the highway with your \"snarkiness\" \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "[deleted]", "That is your expectation. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do drink, but I don\u2019t expect to be provided for. I\u2019m also a big fan of meat and ended up at parties where only vegetarian food was served. Guess what, I ate it. I did not go on social media to complain there was no fillet mignon. If you feel the need to shout out about not being given alcohol at a party, you might need to evaluate your lifestyle choices.", "Yeah I agree that's probably a bit much. It definitely adds a level of assholery to op..", "I don\u2019t drink very often at all because I have migraines, and rarely more than a couple drinks. But I also get really anxious in large crowds of people and I don\u2019t know if I could get through a wedding with no alcohol. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s ubiquitous at adult social functions, it\u2019s a social lubricant.", "Nobody said any of those things. It's the \"want to get drunk\" part I was responding to. \n\nDon't throw out limited context and then get offended when people respond to the words you say. \n\nAnd you still might have alcoholism if those two times you choose to binge drink instead of control yourself. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI'm not here to armchair diagnose, but you literally asked.", "I respect that most people view the term alcoholism as \"totally loses control over body and actions all the time due to booze\", and therefore have a really negative association with the word. \n\n I'm not coming from a place of judgment, just technicality. \n\nUsing substances as a means of escapism in any form is an indicator of a substance abuse problem- even if the use is sporadic. \n\nHappy to hear that you're not regularly getting wasted though. Again, not coming from a place of judgement, and again believe grown adults have the right to do whatever they want with their own bodies, as long as no child/animal/elderly is hurt by actions. \n\n***And no, I'm not implying that anyone is out here hurting kids/old folx/pets. Just adding qualifiers lest my words be taken out of context.", "Yeah, if I found out there wasn\u2019t any food I would just leave after the ceremony is over and go get dinner lol.", "HAHA right?? I mean the ceremony is the important part, so if I was invited to a wedding with no food I would have left once the ceremony is over and just went to dinner", "can you relate to this yourself at all? you seem very emotionally invested in this"]}
