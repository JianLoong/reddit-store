These are usually lunch meetings. Recently, after we were done eating, I was chatting with one of the team members, Jenn, and I yawned. I excused myself and said something like, \"Damn, I shouldn't have loaded up on carbs just now,\" and Jenn laughed and then yawned herself. A few people noticed this and we all had a lame little chuckle over it.\n\nAnother team member in the room, Alice, says to both of us, \"Damn, it looks like you two have the itis.\"  Jenn went wide eyed, but I guess I must have looked puzzled because well, I was. I didn't know what that meant. So Alice goes at me and says, \"I know you're not pretending you don't know what the itis is.\" I simply told her I'm not, and I don't. Alice rolls her eyes and starts to say something and Jenn cuts her off and says, \"What is wrong with you?\" Alice just walked out of the room and Jenn apologized to me on Alice's behalf.\n\nAnother guy, Dan, then explained that that term is rooted in racism, and alludes to a stereotype of laziness associated with African-Americans. Now I'm even more dumbfounded because I cannot imagine what would possess Alice to say this to us. If she wanted to call us both lazy for yawning after lunch she could have put it any number of ways. Alice and Jenn are both black, and I am white, which I guess does matter to this story.\n\nAlice returns and comes at me, calling me racist and saying I shouldn't be here. I didn't say anything. Dan and Jenn and another guy, Pete, came to my defense and told Alice that not only did I not do/say anything racist, but I barely said anything at all, and that they didn't know what her problem was. She swears she is right and I am racist, and then got close up in my face and yelled at me that it is my responsibility to be familiar with all racist terms so I can speak up if I hear one, and says she was testing me and I failed. She said that I should have known what that meant and stood up for Jenn. Alice is petite and I'm a big dude so I felt it would be prudent to create some distance and backed away. She continued about how I am the worst and eventually left the room again. She did not return, and it was all so nuts we decided to break for the day.\n\nDays alter I got a call from their HR telling me someone reported the incident and that they had some questions. I answered honestly and they said that it matched up with what they'd heard, and that Alice would suffer consequences. They apologized and offered me a (paid) out of my contract but I really like working with them and I told them so, and said if you are game to continue then so am I. They were happy and we hung up.\n\nTurns out Alice's consequences were that she was demoted/reassigned and she's saying on social media that a racist man got her kicked off her team at work.\n\nIt doesn't make sense but I do feel guilty.\n\nReddit, AITA For any of this?\n\nEDIT: Thank you to all who took the time to read and comment. Some clarifications: \n\nWe are in the Northeast. I was born and raised here, but I don't know where the rest of them are from. If I had to guess, I would say Jenn was raised here too, but I am not sure. I have no idea about Alice or the rest of them.\n\nI did not go to HR. I don't even work at their company. I'm just a consultant on a short-ish term contract. I'm there once a week, max. After the day was over, I went home and didn't say anything to anyone except my own friends and family.\n\nI have not seen her social media first hand as I don't follow Alice or any of my clients/teams. Someone showed me screenshots of her instagram story rants from the weekend. In Alice's \\*kind of\\* defense, she might not mean me when she says a racist man got her kicked off her team. She could know who went to HR and be talking about that person. \n\nI was hesitant to include it in the original post for fear being rejected/booted, but since some commenters knew or have researched/guessed, what Dan specifically pointed out when explaining \"the itis\" racist roots was that it had stemmed from n-word-itis, and Jenn confirmed.

So now this woman can go to HR and argue OP is stalking her social media and fabricating evidence to make her look bad. Because OP has already gone to HR about this, technically, this woman is right. The difference between OPs complaint and the woman's is that OP factually did make a reputational claim against her in the workplace.\n\nIn most places, HR would have to do a proper investigation all around.
