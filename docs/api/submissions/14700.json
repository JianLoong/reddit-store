These are usually lunch meetings. Recently, after we were done eating, I was chatting with one of the team members, Jenn, and I yawned. I excused myself and said something like, \"Damn, I shouldn't have loaded up on carbs just now,\" and Jenn laughed and then yawned herself. A few people noticed this and we all had a lame little chuckle over it.\n\nAnother team member in the room, Alice, says to both of us, \"Damn, it looks like you two have the itis.\"  Jenn went wide eyed, but I guess I must have looked puzzled because well, I was. I didn't know what that meant. So Alice goes at me and says, \"I know you're not pretending you don't know what the itis is.\" I simply told her I'm not, and I don't. Alice rolls her eyes and starts to say something and Jenn cuts her off and says, \"What is wrong with you?\" Alice just walked out of the room and Jenn apologized to me on Alice's behalf.\n\nAnother guy, Dan, then explained that that term is rooted in racism, and alludes to a stereotype of laziness associated with African-Americans. Now I'm even more dumbfounded because I cannot imagine what would possess Alice to say this to us. If she wanted to call us both lazy for yawning after lunch she could have put it any number of ways. Alice and Jenn are both black, and I am white, which I guess does matter to this story.\n\nAlice returns and comes at me, calling me racist and saying I shouldn't be here. I didn't say anything. Dan and Jenn and another guy, Pete, came to my defense and told Alice that not only did I not do/say anything racist, but I barely said anything at all, and that they didn't know what her problem was. She swears she is right and I am racist, and then got close up in my face and yelled at me that it is my responsibility to be familiar with all racist terms so I can speak up if I hear one, and says she was testing me and I failed. She said that I should have known what that meant and stood up for Jenn. Alice is petite and I'm a big dude so I felt it would be prudent to create some distance and backed away. She continued about how I am the worst and eventually left the room again. She did not return, and it was all so nuts we decided to break for the day.\n\nDays alter I got a call from their HR telling me someone reported the incident and that they had some questions. I answered honestly and they said that it matched up with what they'd heard, and that Alice would suffer consequences. They apologized and offered me a (paid) out of my contract but I really like working with them and I told them so, and said if you are game to continue then so am I. They were happy and we hung up.\n\nTurns out Alice's consequences were that she was demoted/reassigned and she's saying on social media that a racist man got her kicked off her team at work.\n\nIt doesn't make sense but I do feel guilty.\n\nReddit, AITA For any of this?\n\nEDIT: Thank you to all who took the time to read and comment. Some clarifications: \n\nWe are in the Northeast. I was born and raised here, but I don't know where the rest of them are from. If I had to guess, I would say Jenn was raised here too, but I am not sure. I have no idea about Alice or the rest of them.\n\nI did not go to HR. I don't even work at their company. I'm just a consultant on a short-ish term contract. I'm there once a week, max. After the day was over, I went home and didn't say anything to anyone except my own friends and family.\n\nI have not seen her social media first hand as I don't follow Alice or any of my clients/teams. Someone showed me screenshots of her instagram story rants from the weekend. In Alice's \\*kind of\\* defense, she might not mean me when she says a racist man got her kicked off her team. She could know who went to HR and be talking about that person. \n\nI was hesitant to include it in the original post for fear being rejected/booted, but since some commenters knew or have researched/guessed, what Dan specifically pointed out when explaining \"the itis\" racist roots was that it had stemmed from n-word-itis, and Jenn confirmed.

So now this woman can go to HR and argue OP is stalking her social media and fabricating evidence to make her look bad. Because OP has already gone to HR about this, technically, this woman is right. The difference between OPs complaint and the woman's is that OP factually did make a reputational claim against her in the workplace.\n\nIn most places, HR would have to do a proper investigation all around.

Being able to speak up for people makes you a better ally. But knowing every racist term seems statistical unlikely. It's not like you can Google a comprehensive list or racist terms. And not speaking out wouldn't make you racist. This is more of the difference between not being racist and being anti racist.\n\n>says she was testing me and I failed.\n\nEven in a world where it was bad for you to fail the test it would still be more fucked up that she subjected Jenn to racism.

Not trying to be snarky.", "I only know it from having watched The Boondocks. There was a whole episode about it.", "no there is an actually very racist context for it in particular. it doesnt seem particularly well known and i still wouldnt call someone a racist for using \"itis\" on its own, but google \"itis slang origin\" the context in this case is not only the latin root or whatever\n\nediting to add, its more comparable to the word gay, which even ignoring the people who used it as a slur it originally didn't have good connotations, as it camr from gay as in happy, which turned to loose and immoral, which is why it started getting used as homosexual. obviously itis is a bit different, but they are still somewhat comparable", "I think you're *seriously* misunderstanding my comment. I'm actually agreeing with you. \n\nWhat I was saying was that \"Itis\" was already a pre-existing suffix. \n\nSo in the slur that is being referred to, it's the word before \"itis\" that makes it racist. And that word didn't suddenly become racist once \"itis\" was added, because it was already racist.\n\nMeaning \"itis\" shouldn't have any racial connotations.  Especially since \"itis\" can refer to actual medical conditions.", "I think the article you linked is referring to the secondary definition of \"-itis\", i.e. when used to invent fake conditions (like 'senioritis') and/or when used as a standalone noun. The primary definition is it's use as a suffix in pathology, where it comes into English from Ancent Greek through Latin.\n\nThis usage in English to refer to diseases predates the n-word entirely (and therefore also this slur). For example, \"arthritis\" enters English in the 1540s, and according to the OED, the first published reference to the n-word (although spelt differently) was in 1574, and was apparently first used in a derogatory sense in 1774.", "Generally it's American originating from the slavery and sharecropping times.

So if you don\u2019t but you said it to someone else? How would you know if it\u2019s racist or not? \n\nFYI for all the people claiming that it means when you\u2019re full and you get tired, that\u2019s true but that\u2019s the full \nmeaning of it. \n\nFYI again it\u2019s a slang word created by black people \n\n\u201c-itis\u201d meaning there is a word before it but it was shortened because the rest of it is truly inappropriate amongst others.", "NTA\n\nToday I learned a new word\n\nI would have assumed she was making some joke about sleepiness being contagious or something", "NTA.

I have never heard that term and wouldn't know what it meant. I don't even know how to pronounce it. Her story of giving you a \"test\" is bizarre.

I've never heard about \"itis\" before either. I assumed it was something like yawn-itis, as in, contagious yawning since you both yawned. It seemed that things escalated from there and Alice suddenly felt like she needed to defend the fact that she said this, and the best way for that was to make up the \"test to see if you're racist\".. And then she escalated from there, digging an even deeper hole for herself.\n\nNote: I even googled it and most results show food-related tiredness and nothing to do with race or racism. 1-2 out of 20 results were tweets and personal opinions that \"itis\" is something racist. Honestly it sounds like a situation that got out of control, and Alice unfortunately decided that she wanted to double down, instead of owning up (Even though I have a feeling Alice also didn't know \"itis\" was supposedly something racist.)\n\nNTA, OP.
