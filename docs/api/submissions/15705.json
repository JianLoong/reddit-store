This was wild.", "NTA that was not a joke! It was at best a cruel prank and frankly pranks suck! That would and should be the last time you go over to that house unless they apologize and also quit smoking around you.", "NTA. You were worried for you dogs health and safety and made this verbally clear with everyone. Then they play a joke and expect you to take it as a joke when it could\u2019ve been something serious. They can\u2019t get mad about you yelling when they\u2019re the ones that caused it.\n\nLong story short, don\u2019t play a bad prank on someone and not expect the outcome of them not liking it.\n\nThat\u2019s like when people ask someone out and expect them to say yes all the time. If you\u2019re scared of rejection, don\u2019t do it. \n\nNTA", "NTA, they played a mean joke on you and then are upset that you responded normally. It\u2019s shocking how people think a joke is a get out of being a jerk free card or that you\u2019re not supposed to respond.  I hope you break up with this woman. She and her family sound toxic.", "NTA\n\nFirst, this isn't your problem.  This is your GF's family; it's her responsibility to make sure that her family members respect her, you, and the things important to you both.\n\nSecond, assuming everything you said is accurate, you were very clear.\n\nNow's the chance for your GF to step up and stand up to her family.", "NTA. Even if it wasn't a bad joke already, they should be the ones apologizing for making a knowingly dark/insensitive joke. \"Haha, we're poisoning your dog\", like wtf. \n\nAdditionally for future reference, just saying something within earshot probably isn't good enough for something so important. Personally, if I'm not actively listening for something, I'm liable to not absorb what's being said.", "NTA\n\n>that they tell me it was a joke \n\nOh yeah. Funny joke convincing you that they'd fed your dog something toxic. /s\n\nI'd never let any of them near the dog again. That includes the girlfriend is she's on their side.", "Bruh if someone even acted like they were going to do something that could in any way harm my babies they would be getting a lot more than an earful and I would never speak to them again. NTA.", "Erm. Pretending to poison your dog for a joke is not funny man! Raisins and currents are so poisonous for dogs. You probably did over react but I think at the time you were justified. If you are still holding onto that anger now then yes the asshole and also you should never shout at your gfs family because whatever the reason they will think you are a prick. I\u2019m going with NTA because they had no right to pretend to poison your dog for jokes.", "NTA. Jokes are supposed to be funny.", "NTA. They pushed you to bring your dog and then objected to your rules for feeding him", "NTA. Attempting murder is not something to joke about, but if that's the kind of thing they find funny, you could give them almonds and tell them it's known for a high concentration of hydrogen cyanide when they are eating them. It's somewhat exaggerated, but [true enough.](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-almonds-poisonous)", "Honestly I think you\u2019re well within your rights not to bring your dog over ever again between their smoking around him and their daft idea of a joke. I thought jokes were meant to be funny and pretending to poison your dog isn\u2019t make my sides split with laughter. People aren\u2019t automatically excused for their dipshit behaviour for using the word joke. NTA\n\nEdit: You may want to let your girlfriend know the list of foods toxic to dogs if she isn\u2019t aware already as it\u2019s an easy mistake to make", " NTA. That\u2019s not a joke. That\u2019s horrible.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a joke, it\u2019s just flat out disrespect and a way to make fun of you, clearly. \u201cLook at the silly person, caring about that large mongrel, getting so angry over it eating scraps.
