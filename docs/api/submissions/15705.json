Raisins are super toxic to dogs.  Absolutely NTA, and fuck those people.", "NTA. I wouldn't go over any more even with an apology. Clearly they have no regard for you or your dog and the health concerns you have. It's not just a little second hand smoke (and even if it was boundaries are boundaries. I smoke myself and my boyfriend hates cig smoke, so I started smoking only outside, and cut back from a pack a day to one every once in awhile and have mostly switched to vaping. I would absolutely smoke outside if I had a friend or family member that was uncomfortable, it wouldn't even be a question if they had asthma) you have asthma. If you had a severe asthma attack because of it I wonder what they'd think then. And \"joking\" about feeding toxic food to your dog is not only ridiculously over the line, but also dangerous. What if the dog actually ate it? It's not like the dog knows that it's a joke and not to eat it. They could have accidentally dropped it, or the dog could have snatched it, or it could teach the dog that it's an okay thing to eat. If it was me I would refuse to speak to them until I felt they had actually changed and benefited my life. If my gf couldn't understand why I made that decision, she can get the boot too. It's absolutely unacceptable behavior. And if your gf was one of the people that got mad, then you need to have a think to yourself about the relationship, and have some conversations with her about this situation, and any other that are problems", "I'd feed grandma some bleach\n\nYno as a joke! \n\nNta", "NTA - That's wild. They really thought that was a joke. Gosh, I thought it was common sense to ask the owners permission before feeding a dog. Some dogs are on special diets, you never know. It's really not a joke. \nHope your dog is okay \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA, giving your dog food that has toxic substances in it is NEVER a joke. Yes, the fruit (raisins, I'm assuming) was removed, but fruit has oils that can be absorbed, even when dried (raisins still stain paper if you leave them on there, also bread is frequently used to absorb, way, soup). Furthermore, that's not even considering what happens to the ingredients in the bun while being baked or if tiny fragments were embedded elsewhere, the sugar, milk etc in this product. If you've tasted dog biscuits, you'll know they're... An acquired flavour. I believe dogs can't digest lactose, but depending on the breed/individual they have varying intolerances and toxins.\n\n\nThis family has shown you they can't be trusted. At best, your gf picked out the fruit and conspired with her grandma, at worst, her grandma willfully tried to harm your dog. Maybe she didn't notice, people don't think about the composition of food, but you explicitly asked them not to feed it. Either way, it's not a joke and you need to have a serious chat with your gf if she thinks this is acceptable.\n\n\nYour dog may be big, but that doesn't mean the poor thing can't get sick. My dog as a puppy jumped on the table and ate a fresh packet of choc chip cookies while we were out. They were in the middle of the table and for the life of me I still don't know HOW he jumped on the dining table. He's fine, it gave us a heart attack and we now clear out everything he may be able to reach because he's a... Lovely dog.... He is, but my god did I have a heart attack! He doesn't jump on tables anymore (as far as I know), but I don't leave anything up to chance anymore.\n\n\nI'd also like to add that, if children is something you're interested in in the future, then bear in mind that these people don't respect you, your pet and they definitely won't respect any children you may or may not have. You're asthmatic and they smoke around you, putting your health at risk. Your gf tolerates this and has subtly told everyone that your overall health doesn't matter. You've expressed that your dog cannot eat something as it is toxic. They fed it to your dog.\n\nI can assure you, if my family smoked near my asthmatics partner, I'd advocate for my partner and make them listen. If they don't then we'd only see them in explicitly nonsmoking areas (pubs, cafes etc). If that means they miss out on holidays, well that's such a shame.\n\n\nIs this the life you want? They don't respect you, your gf doesn't advocate for you and they sure don't seem likeable from what you've said. Ofc, this is just from what I've gathered in your comment, they could all be lovely people who have their vices and quirks, but I'd never think of treating another like this.", "LEAVE THIS WOMAN AND HER FAMILY.
