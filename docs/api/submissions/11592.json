You are an adult when you can fully support yourself, pay all of your own bills without help from anyone (including a cell phone), have a good job, and are a contributing member of society. That is the definition of an adult. As long as someone pays your way, you are not an adult.\n\nYTA - while under her roof (or your father's) she/he owns the air you breathe! You do not pay the cellphone bill. You are by no means an adult when you are 18. You are not fully cooked - at best, you are medium rare.

If they're no longer living within the school zone then they're no longer eligible to be enrolled.", "I think that court order can control the parents and minor child, but not an adult child. The children are not parties to the divorce or custody. Minor children are the responsibility of their parents and orders binding the parents will necessarily bind the minor children. But once the child reaches adulthood, the court\u2019s authority over their actions by way of the divorce/custody is gone.\n\nSo an order that the parents need to keep paying child support until the child is 21 would stay in effect. So would an order requiring certain funding for college or trusts (because those things all bind the parties directly). And they probably have to keep providing housing until the adult child graduates high school, one way or another. But the court can\u2019t make the child take any action or refrain from any action at that point unless there\u2019s a guardianship or other court action directly involving the adult child. \n\nAlso, under the law, the parents are obligated to keep providing for the child until they graduate or drop out of high school (probably, depending on the state, probably also with an upper age limit in that requirement), but if the child decides to leave their parent\u2019s house after they turn 18 but before graduating high school, that\u2019s their decision.\n\nEdited because I hit post too soon by accident\nEdited again to correct a typo and complete a thought", "Completely valid points.

Even though my total costs are in the thousands ( including pulling up the subfloor to repair water damage her dog and cat did because she would lock her untrained dog in a crate for 24hrs+ no pee breaks and it would piss through the bottom and she never changed her litter box so her cat did buisness everwhere) the prosecutor would not file criminal charges.
