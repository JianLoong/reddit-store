Next question please. \n\nSeriously though, unless something major is wrong with OP (like conservatotship level wrong)  they do not have any real authority over an 18M any jurisdiction that I know of.  Would not have any authority over 18F in most of the civilized world.", "The whole immediate family shares it. Mine has been shared since I\u2019ve had a phone.", "Old habits die hard?\n\nI\u2019m 22, I still share my location with my entire family. I still ask if I can go to the store, or go bowling, or other things like that. It\u2019s a habit, and a relatively safe one as well.\n\nOP\u2019s mom is being weird about it though. OP, NTA btw", "OK, but the (18M) portion of your story is relevant.  That's an adult in every jurisdiction I'm aware of.  That's when \"things you do as a kid living under a parent's roof\" generally stop.\n\nYour mother has already shown an inability to deal with your location information properly, and weaponizes it against you.  What obligation do you have to keep sharing it, exactly?  If she needs to know where you are that badly she can call or text you.", "You are 18\u2026 a legal adult. Custody sharing is over so what you want and stay with who you want.", "NTA. Did you know you're old enough to choose who you want to love with? That means if you want to stay with your dad full time since he's more chill and gives you space to be you. Your mom may not like it but you're safe and cared for and it doesn't mean you never have to see your mom again.. if anything things may get better because she'll learn to respect your independence.", "You\u2019re 18. No need for mom to hover like that. She has to trust you to manie good decisions. That\u2019s how I would position it with her.  My son moved out at 17 for university and I wouldn\u2019t dream of fmf.", "NTA. You're 18 now, and that is the age of majority in all jurisdictions. You are a full fledged adult in the eyes of the law, with all the rights and privileges that go with it. You don't have to share any information with anyone you don't want to.", "NTA. Tell her you will share location when she respects your bounderies. Her behavior was off the chain. It's one thing to check your location if it is past curfew, quite another to stalk your adult son. Damn I am so happy I grew up without cell phones, and even happier my daughter did as well. I didn't need to know everything, I raised her well and had to trust that.", "Sir you are a whole ass adult. I get letting them know where you are going and when you plan to come back and maybe even a curfew since you are still financially dependent on them but you are right and she does not need to treat you like a child. Also that custody arrangement means Fuck all since you are an adult", "NTA.   \nYou are 18, an adult. Stop letting anyone track your location, choose a parent to stay with, or move out.", "Why on earth do people think that because you are 18 you are an adult? Age does not make an adult; it only defines whether you are a minor or are at the age of majority. At 18 you have the right to drive, sign contracts, own property, vote, get married, and go into the military. You are an adult when you can fully support yourself, pay all of your own bills without help from anyone (including a cell phone), have a good job, and are a contributing member of society. That is the definition of an adult. As long as someone pays your way, you are not an adult.\n\nYTA - while under her roof (or your father's) she/he owns the air you breathe! You do not pay the cellphone bill. You are by no means an adult when you are 18. You are not fully cooked - at best, you are medium rare. Hanging out on school property at 9:30 PM - calling you medium rare is a stretch. You can be cited for trespassing if you were caught. Seriously stupid. Want to go to a top university or get a good job, not with a misdemeanor on your record (yes, they do criminal background checks). You had better turn back on that feature before you find yourself without a phone (and possibly grounded). Your mom is not being a helicopter parent. She is being a parent! Get over your entitled self.", "NTA but as an young adult you should have an adult conversation with your mother. Personally I wonder if it's you or your dad she doesn't trust here but either way you are an adult. As an adult you're entitled to choose with whom you share this information but if mom pays for the service she could demand a stipulation to remain funded.", "jesus your 18 yrs old why are you sill being treated like a 12 yr old. you need to tell your parents that your location is now turned off and where you go has nothing to do with them as your an adult and will no longer be treated like a child", "YTA, pay your bills", "You\u2019re 18 so legally you\u2019re an adult but as long as you\u2019re still living with your parents they have a right to know certain things especially if you\u2019re still in high school. \nYTA. I get it that parents can be annoying but they worry because they love you. Until you\u2019re fully independent and living on your own paying your own bills you need to respect both of them.

Lots of kids turn 18 during their senior year in the Us.", "Parent* the dad was just probably told wrong by the mom like \u201cOP is doing something dangerous\u201d so he probably was seeing if op was ok and once he confirmed OP was infact ok he then let it go but the mom oh boy it seems like the mom is a controlling helicopter mom who wants every minute detail of OP\u2019s whereabouts", "Idk about you but I didn\u2019t magically become an adult who wasn\u2019t dependent on my parents when I turned 18.

Like, generally, your parents can't kick you out of the house the day you turn 18 if you're still in high school.\n\nDoesn't change the fact that OP would be able to live where they wanted though and not be beholden to \"taking turns with the parents\".  Friends of mine with divorced parents could generally make that decision around age 15-16.", "When I started reading your post, I thought you were thirteen or fourteen. You're eighteen man! \n\nWhy the hell are you being tracked like a child?

Your mom sounds like she is having a hard time adjusting to you having more freedom and growing up. I encourage you to sit down with your mom when you are both calm and talk about some boundaries. I get everyone sharing their location, it\u2019s super helpful at times. At most she should have texted you \u201chey, I see you are at the school, it\u2019s late and I just want to make sure you are ok and staying safe\u201d no reason she should be calling and upset.", "NTA\nYou're 18, you don't need to be tracked and treated like a child. Besides it's not like you didn't tell someone where you were.", "Nta, she was borderline stalking you.  If one person knew, and u were safe, what was the problem", "NTA for the location stuff. Y T A for the lying and triangulation though.\n\nI can see why your parents aren't buying it, and I have a decent idea what you're covering. I can see why they're concerned. You're 18, and don't want them looking out for you anymore, fair enough; however, that means you need to start looking after yourself. Those \"never could happen to me\" flukes happen every day, and it's even more traumatic when it's the result of dumb decisions. Stay safe.", "NTA \n\nYour mom's intentions are good. She's worried about you and your safety. She probably is having difficulty with your transition into adulthood. I'd recommend she seek professional help/therapy.\n\nOP you could say something like \"Mom, you and Dad have raised me to be a responsible conscientious person. You've taught me to make good decisions. It's not healthy for you to be constantly monitoring my location or worried about me.
