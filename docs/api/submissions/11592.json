I'm a parent myself, but there's a time to cut the strings and let the kids do their own thing.\n\nMom needs to back off or she's going to drive you away.\n\nIt's a balancing act.

Presumably that meant vis a text or a known call. Mom was hovering.", "NTA. Both of your parents are treating you like you're 13. This is a very good first step but you have a long way to go.

OP, NTA btw", "OK, but the (18M) portion of your story is relevant.  That's an adult in every jurisdiction I'm aware of.  That's when \"things you do as a kid living under a parent's roof\" generally stop.\n\nYour mother has already shown an inability to deal with your location information properly, and weaponizes it against you.  What obligation do you have to keep sharing it, exactly?  If she needs to know where you are that badly she can call or text you."]}
