Since she\u2019s been pregnant she has been having a go at me for small things like if I don\u2019t make dinner for her or when I cook her the wrong thing. Before she was pregnant she was never like this she was always very sweet. \n\nYesterday my wife came back from her parents house and I made homemade pizza for us. She told me she doesn\u2019t want pizza and to cook her something else. I told her if it\u2019s quick and easy I\u2019ll make it, she asked for homemade chicken dumplings. I told her I\u2019m not making that because that will take ages. She told me she\u2019s pregnant and is craving dumplings. I told her \u201cI know your pregnant but I\u2019m not making dumplings for you\u201d. She started having a rage that I wouldn\u2019t cook her something. It was 6pm at night I\u2019m not whipping out all this ingredients. I told her to make it herself or to not have anything. \n\nWhen I had my pizza she was sitting on the couch sobbing saying that I don\u2019t love her or the baby. I told her I\u2019ll make dumplings tomorrow night for her but not tonight. She told me to fuck off somewhere else. I asked my friend if I could stay the night with him and he said yes. Packed clothes and slammed the door behind me. When I was half way to my friends my wife texted me begging for me to come back so I told her to fuck off like she did with me. \n\nSo aita?", "created_utc": 1671634411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrp3ng/aita_for_going_to_my_friends_house_when_my_wife/", "score": 13634, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been around significant portions of the MANY pregnancies of my siblings and yes, hormones are awful, but they DO NOT give a woman a free pass to be abusive and then absolute immunity to repercussions.\n\nMaybe you could have worded your response better and told her that, no, you weren't coming home because you needed time to cool off but just because she's pregnant doesn't mean that you don't get to feel upset or hurt by her actions.", "NTA- Just because she\u2019s pregnant that doesn\u2019t give her the right to boss you around or emotionally manipulate you or be verbally abusive.

Maybe she needs to speak to a professional if she\u2019s having a hard time managing her emotions and it\u2019s impacting her relationships.", "NTA. It's actually very refreshing to be on a feed where not everyone is immediately acting like pregnant women are saints who gave no control. There's this weird phenomenon on the internet at the moment at as soon as someone is pregnant they are no longer responsible for their actions and must be treated like finest porcelain lest they weep a single tear. Having been there and done that, yes it's horrid and hard at points but you don't get to have temper tantrums and sob that your partner doesn't love you or the baby just because you aren't immediately getting your way. Sounds like this was the straw that broke the camels back for OP.", "NTA. While I do agree telling her to fuck off is not the most adult thing to do, everything else shows she is being too entitled and being manipulative.

If she is willing to pick something that's easier to make, you'll be happy to do that for her.\n\nShe may have raging hormones but she needs to remember who she was before she was pregnant and acting like a raging person isn't appealing.\n\nTaking out her anger on you shouldn't be a go to. How is she going to be with her child when they don't do what she wants  them to do? Is she gonna tell them yo f off too?\n\nYou however need to understand that when you're hungry that you become hangery. Learn to keep your cool but stand your ground and tell your partner, because that's what she is, that her attitude isn't on. If she wants food she can have what you're willing to make. Being pregnant doesn't excuse the treatment you give others but you can recognise your behaviour afterwards and do something about it.\n\nAsking in advance what she wants to eat for needing to make it might also help. So before she left her parents so when she gets home,  you've made it. Planning helps to avoid arguments.", "NTA she's pregnant. Not disabled. You made dinner for you both. She demands a dish that takes serious prep time. She can either make it herself, make it with you, or eat something else. Hormones can be wild, but this is next level stuff.

That kind of language is a quick way to put yourself on my bad side and get a dose of your own medicine.", "NTA at all, chicken and dumplings takes hours to make! No way you can do that at 6pm. Just because she is pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she can just abuse you.", "I actually think this isn't really about who is and isn't the asshole. Honestly, if your wife has undergone a huge personality change I would wonder if she may struggling with prenatal depression/anxiety?

Understandable, pregnancy is tough.\n\nBut this new trend of extreme entitlement is just wow. Abusive behaviour and demands is just crazy.", "I am SO annoyed by people blaming shitty behaviours on hormones and we should ben to any desire if pregnant woman. I was pregnant, had cravings and guess what, I wasn't becoming a hangry monster if nobody caved in.  NTA OP, and good luck", "NTA\n\nI know all about pregnancy hormones but it doesn't give you the right to act like a spoiled damn brat.  If she wanted chicken and dumplings so bad, why didn't she get up and make it herself.  She's not handicap, she's only pregnant.  I hate to hear people say you have to excuse her because she pregnant.  No you don't have to excuse her if she's being rude and nasty.", "NTA. Being pregnant isn't a pass for unreasonable requests and expectations. It's also not an excuse to forget your manners, be rude and horrible to people.\n\nYou've already given her a choice and offered to cook what she likes within means, but she responded with entitlement and doesn't appreciate your efforts to appease her. You've also compromised and offered to make it the next day which is reasonable, but she emotionally blackmailed you and then go on to insult you. Your wife needs to understand her behaviour was unbecoming and you did the right thing to give her space to calm down.", "NTA for not being manipulated into cooking dumplings. \n\nThe f-off response you texted back was not very nice though. Your wife should not have said it to you either but just because she said it doesn\u2019t me you were right to.", "NTA. Pregnancy isn\u2019t an excuse to be rude, demanding and abusive. If she\u2019s not normally like this, then her doctor needs to be told. Either way she doesn\u2019t get to be rude and demanding. Why can\u2019t she make the food herself? I had a friend like this, always used their baby as an excuse to be rude to her husband. Then the baby was born and it was I had your child, you\u2019ll do it or else. Then shocked he got fed up and divorced her. Sobbing how she can\u2019t believe he would do this.. but we all told her long ago she was being too much.

I\u2019ve had two kids and never acted like that. Anyone I know that has had kids has not acting like this either. She is showing you who she really is and you better pay attention because it\u2019s only going to get worse. Is this what you want the rest of your life?\n\nIs she even working right now? If not, she should be cooking her own food and for you too. If you\u2019re the one working and paying all of the bills, she should be doing the cooking and cleaning and there\u2019s no excuse for her not to. I did everything up until I gave birth, literally. There\u2019s plenty of people out there that have no choice but to work until they literally give birth because they have families to support. Unless she\u2019s on bed rest or something she should be making her own food.", "NTA im pregnant and still would never think about talking to my SO that way, shes using it as an excuse to be a bully.

(She could have made it if she wanted it that bad) Then she cries and sobs that you don\u2019t love her or the baby because of it. She can take that emotional manipulation and kick rocks. \n\nShe told you to fuck off, so you fucked off. She doesn\u2019t get to call you sobbing and begging for you to come back. \n\nShe needs to get control of herself and stop taking everything out on you.

Good luck.", "Pregnancy on her part does not mean a responsibility to act like a doormat on your part.

She's ungrateful that you cooked the wrong thing for her? Wtf??? I've been pregnant twice before and there is absolutely no good reason to be mad at someone for cooking the wrong thing, you even offered to make something different if it was easy!!! She could also let you know what she is in the mood for before you start cooking. This is crazy, even for pregnancy hormones.", "Hot take but I'm going with ESH. \n\nIt's not acceptable to tell your partner to fuck off in any circumstance that isn't a clear joke. You were right to leave to go to your friend's house, but telling her to fuck off when she contacted you was pretty low and petty. \n\nDumplings are not a quick whip up meal and general rules of \"this is what's for dinner, if you don't like it you're on your own\" is exactly how I grew up so maybe my view is skewed, but it seems reasonable that you offered to make that the next night. \n\nIt's incredibly concerning that her behaviour has changed like this. Saying shit like \"you don't love me or the baby\" is a gross manipulation tactic. Is you reversed the gender roles in this situation, it's very clear to see the general situation you are NTA. \n\nMy judgement is purely on your last sentence, which takes it from NTA to ESH. \n\n>When I was half way to my friends my wife texted me begging for me to come back so I told her to fuck off like she did with me.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but you both need to talk to a therapist.

It\u2019s going to be worse after the baby is born because just about the time she gets her equilibrium back, the baby will be born, adding new stressors, and another change in body chemistry. \n\nPPD is a serious worry at the best of times.

Is there anything else I can make or can we get takeout for something similar?\", here's what you did:\n\n1. Told her you're \"*not whipping out the ingredients\"*\n2. Told her *\"make it yourself or don't have anything\"* when she's probably starving as she's growing your child all by herself\n3. Continued to make yourself pizza, and didn't make any for her\n4. When she gets emotional and says \"*you don't love me or the baby*\" given that you only gave her the option of something she doesn't want, you did not give her an alternative or even pretend to be understanding that she wanted something else.\n5. When she gets angry and says to *\"F off\"* (which I don't think is right, but I've been pg and hormonal and huge..... you are just not yourself when your body is demanding food for an unborn baby you're carrying), you get angry too.\n6. You leave to cool down (which I don't disagree with)\n7. When your wife comes down from her emotional hormone wave, and calls and begs you to come back, where you two can talk this out, you do not give her grace but tell the woman CARRYING YOUR CHILD to *\"F off\"*\n\nMy friend, wait until you're sleep deprived with a newborn. You need to get some conflict resolution skills NOW - both of you, but especially you, the person whose body and hormonal balance haven't been out of whack for 7 months with 2 to go.\n\nApologize to her and learn to control your temper... this is a temporary situation, and let me tell you it is difficult to be pg and often miserable.

Good luck.", "I'll be honest, I was a complete AH during my first pregnancy to term. After a couple of miscarriages,  I was so stressed out during my pregnancy. Even towards the end, I was freaking out all the time. It made it almost impossible to regulate any emotions, and outbursts were common. \n\nI went into labor during a snow storm, and we had to drive 20 miles through an area with no cell service and 6 inches of snow. I was convinced that I was going to end having the baby in the car because we'd wreck. My hubby drove safe, but I was inconsolable for most of the trip. Every contraction I had, I would threaten divorce because \"he didn't care about the safety of me or our baby.\" Looking back, we can laugh about it, but at the time, it was so hard to go through.\n\nI'm not saying that pregnancy is an excuse necessarily, but it can make it harder to control emotions when you are in the moment.\n\nI was much better with my second pregnancy to term, thank goodness. \n\nOP, if your wife isn't typically like this, remember the \"real\" her is in there somewhere, and she is probably frustrated with herself as well.

She's pregnant and a bit uncomfortable. Moodiness, irritability, and sometimes a little bit of irrationality  come with the territory. However,  she seems a bit over the top with her demands.

All of this excuses us when we start randomly crying about something stupid. It excuses us when we pitifully ask if our partner feels like making the dish we\u2019re craving.

My sister was like this when she was pregnant with her first. She had a FULL personality change about month 5-6 and started snapping at people, yelling, had zero temper or tolerance, quit her dream job, had cravings for food she was deathly allergic to and would break down sobbing because she couldn't have them... It fucking sucked and the family has no idea how or why her husband stayed with her. When my niece was born my sister had severe post-partum depression that necessitated a few weeks in a treatment facility (though I think some of that depression was exacerbated by how badly her relationships had been affected). Her second and third pregnancies were pretty standard although after #2 she lost the ability to watch anything scarier than Hocus Pocus without crying so that's weird.\n\nI only bring this up to say that pregnancy affects different bodies in different ways and some people can be severely physically or mentally affected by pregnancy far beyond what most of the population experiences. It's *possible* that the way she's acting right now is not a permanent personality change or really something she's in full control of.

Obviously this is extremely negative for a relationship dynamic and can cause a lot of built-up resentment and anxiety. \n\nAlso, importantly, normalizing non-normal behavior means that the pregnant woman or the new mom in question *does not get the help that she needs*. If we wave away behaviors that are a clear sign of emotional distress with the \"oh, she's just pregnant and hormones suck\" wand, then we're ignoring what could be signs of a true need for help.\n\nHaving never been pregnant (to full term), it strikes me that OP's SO went from a full on rage about food, to sobbing about how OP doesn't love her or the baby and telling him to fuck off, to calling him and asking him to come back - all in a pretty brief span of time.

Dude needed to get away from that abuse.", "No, he was being abused and got away from the situation. She wasn't left hungry, he cooked. Even if he didn't cook, she's an adult and can feed herself.

Car pulls out and a huge SUV snakes the car that's waiting and pulls in.

I don't see a placard or sticker on your car.\"\n\nShe turned to him and snapped \"I'm pregnant! Go park somewhere else, grandpa!\" and continued to pull her kids out of the back. The other car drove away and I could hear her loudly bitching about \"men always thinking they are entitled to everything\" while getting her 4 kids into strollers and shit. And she looked like she may have been just starting to show, if she was even pregnant. Either way, she had no placard or any other indication on her car that she was indeed handicapped.

It's hard to imagine what it's like, and I can assume it's different for everyone, but that shit meddles with your brain badly, and sometimes leaves you beyond all reasoning. \n\nI have pretty rare emotional pregnancy moments, but they have happened in each pregnancy, and afterwards they're usually a great story and a laugh, but in the moment he really has to be the sole source of rationality because I simply can't. It sounds silly, but pregnant brain tells me that what you're feeling IS rational. It may be ridiculous, but in the moment, you FEEL you're right. \n\nI will still go with OP being NTA, I just hope he can stay strong and keeps in mind that his wife will probably go back to being her old self once the hormone stuff has settled down again.

I'm sure in a year or 2 you'll laugh about it. \n\nSmall side story on the issue: A good 7 months ago, I had this one day where I was freaking out over the fact that my husbands guild (a group of people in his online game) had women in it. Mind you, I'm normally not the over-jealous type, and he didn't even SPEAK to any of these women, I just noticed that there WERE women present. I freaked out over it so badly that I was googling how to get out of a mortgage contract and split up. Out of nowhere. He was all \"deer in the headlight\"-mode, completely lost about what's going on. That afternoon, again out of nowhere, I shouted. \"I'm just in a weird mood. Leave me alone and we'll talk tomorrow.\" . He answered me then - the first thing at all that he'd said in a few hours: \"I don't know... either you're pregnant or you've lost your marbles.\" . I ordered a test and a few days later we knew he was right. :)", "Seriously why are all these women so mean?\n\nIf you asked my husband if I was different during pregnancy or harder to handle he\u2019d say I wasn\u2019t \u201cdifferent\u201d I was just \u201cworse\u201d and what he means is I\u2019d cried waaaay more. But it wasn\u2019t over petty demands.\n\nIt was like things that normally made me sad but had no real need for crying. Like I went out and got a frapp, one for me and my husband. I B went to change into comfy clothes came back and found out my basset hound had knocked mine off the counter and was licking it off the floor\u2026I burst into tears lol. My husband gave me his and we split it. Just dumb stuff like, my hormonal response was the same just waaay more extreme at times. I also cried during the opening scene of the first (new) Star Trek movie when the captain sends off his pregnant wife and stayed behind to fight on the ship.

My wife had a few tantrums towards me while pregnant -- I knew I didn't deserve them, and I let her know that I did not appreciate it. But I also didn't escalate back to her or tell her to fuck off in return. I kept my patience. I knew she was going through a lot. She always later apologized to me. I also offered to talk through it, and most of the time there was something going on in the background mentally that she needed to work out. Pregnancy is wild with hormonal changes and anxiety. What is it, through sickness and health? That includes mental illness. Unfortunately, as their partner, you can sometimes end up as the lightning rod. Being mentally ill is not an excuse to be an asshole, but it is human to err as well. As long as she'd apologize and come back to talk things through rationally, I'd be OK. In the end, she appreciated me more and it brought us closer together. I could have told her to fuck off, and I wouldn't have been \"in the wrong.\" But I owe her more than that.

You get the idea, they behave badly but there's always an excuse that one is supposed to not only accept but feel badly for them. If you try to say X is no excuse for being rude or mean then you are judgmental and cruel.  Personally,  I've gotten to the point that I stop this person as they begin their tirade and say:  \"I know you're not feeling well but that doesn't give you the right to treat me poorly. I'm walking away before this becomes more heated and meanwhile,  you can think over what it is you want to say to me\".

You don't get a free pass in my book to be rude, mean, and demanding just because you are carrying a baby in your stomach.  Sure hormones jump around as they do for women who are menstruating,  pregnant,  or going through menopause.  I have been through all three and I was never demanding or rude. Having a hormonal change does not change the essence of who you are inside. Some women (and men) will hate me for saying this but I believe there are no acceptable excuses for being mean spirited.  But at the same time, people do get moody at times, both men and women,  and perhaps behave in an undesirable way.  Do they get a free pass because they are pregnant? No they don't but some irritation doesn't need to become WWIII and get family and friends giving their opinions. You could have easily said to your wife \"I don't like the way you are speaking to me right now and I'm getting hot. Before this turns into something bigger I'm going to take a walk and give you time to think. Sometimes just taking yourself out of the situation for 30 mins can change things completely.

If they do something nice it must be because they want something out of it. With the men it seemed as if they're a helpless, braindead animal that just couldn't help itself. Even the language changed, suddenly it's not \"him\" doing the thing but it's his anger issues, etc.)  And I felt like even women will often have comparatively more empathy for a guy than the woman in whatever situation. But my toxic ex-environment is probably not representative lol.\n\nBut this all made me believe that humans have this weird trait of hating a creature more the more aware it is,- and my perceived hierarchy goes like this: Animal < kids < man < woman.", "My youngest was born 3 pushes after my OB asked if I wanted to redo the epidural.
