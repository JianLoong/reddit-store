Since she\u2019s been pregnant she has been having a go at me for small things like if I don\u2019t make dinner for her or when I cook her the wrong thing. Before she was pregnant she was never like this she was always very sweet. \n\nYesterday my wife came back from her parents house and I made homemade pizza for us. She told me she doesn\u2019t want pizza and to cook her something else. I told her if it\u2019s quick and easy I\u2019ll make it, she asked for homemade chicken dumplings. I told her I\u2019m not making that because that will take ages. She told me she\u2019s pregnant and is craving dumplings. I told her \u201cI know your pregnant but I\u2019m not making dumplings for you\u201d. She started having a rage that I wouldn\u2019t cook her something. It was 6pm at night I\u2019m not whipping out all this ingredients. I told her to make it herself or to not have anything. \n\nWhen I had my pizza she was sitting on the couch sobbing saying that I don\u2019t love her or the baby. I told her I\u2019ll make dumplings tomorrow night for her but not tonight. She told me to fuck off somewhere else. I asked my friend if I could stay the night with him and he said yes. Packed clothes and slammed the door behind me. When I was half way to my friends my wife texted me begging for me to come back so I told her to fuck off like she did with me. \n\nSo aita?", "created_utc": 1671634411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrp3ng/aita_for_going_to_my_friends_house_when_my_wife/", "score": 303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's actually very refreshing to be on a feed where not everyone is immediately acting like pregnant women are saints who gave no control. There's this weird phenomenon on the internet at the moment at as soon as someone is pregnant they are no longer responsible for their actions and must be treated like finest porcelain lest they weep a single tear. Having been there and done that, yes it's horrid and hard at points but you don't get to have temper tantrums and sob that your partner doesn't love you or the baby just because you aren't immediately getting your way.

How is she going to be with her child when they don't do what she wants  them to do? Is she gonna tell them yo f off too?\n\nYou however need to understand that when you're hungry that you become hangery. Learn to keep your cool but stand your ground and tell your partner, because that's what she is, that her attitude isn't on. If she wants food she can have what you're willing to make. Being pregnant doesn't excuse the treatment you give others but you can recognise your behaviour afterwards and do something about it.\n\nAsking in advance what she wants to eat for needing to make it might also help.

She can take that emotional manipulation and kick rocks. \n\nShe told you to fuck off, so you fucked off. She doesn\u2019t get to call you sobbing and begging for you to come back. \n\nShe needs to get control of herself and stop taking everything out on you.

I've been pregnant twice before and there is absolutely no good reason to be mad at someone for cooking the wrong thing, you even offered to make something different if it was easy!!!

This is crazy, even for pregnancy hormones.", "Hot take but I'm going with ESH. \n\nIt's not acceptable to tell your partner to fuck off in any circumstance that isn't a clear joke. You were right to leave to go to your friend's house, but telling her to fuck off when she contacted you was pretty low and petty. \n\nDumplings are not a quick whip up meal and general rules of \"this is what's for dinner, if you don't like it you're on your own\" is exactly how I grew up so maybe my view is skewed, but it seems reasonable that you offered to make that the next night. \n\nIt's incredibly concerning that her behaviour has changed like this.

Is you reversed the gender roles in this situation, it's very clear to see the general situation you are NTA. \n\nMy judgement is purely on your last sentence, which takes it from NTA to ESH. \n\n>When I was half way to my friends my wife texted me begging for me to come back so I told her to fuck off like she did with me.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but you both need to talk to a therapist.

It\u2019s going to be worse after the baby is born because just about the time she gets her equilibrium back, the baby will be born, adding new stressors, and another change in body chemistry. \n\nPPD is a serious worry at the best of times.

Is there anything else I can make or can we get takeout for something similar?\", here's what you did:\n\n1. Told her you're \"*not whipping out the ingredients\"*\n2. Told her *\"make it yourself or don't have anything\"* when she's probably starving as she's growing your child all by herself\n3. Continued to make yourself pizza, and didn't make any for her\n4. When she gets emotional and says \"*you don't love me or the baby*\" given that you only gave her the option of something she doesn't want, you did not give her an alternative or even pretend to be understanding that she wanted something else.\n5. When she gets angry and says to *\"F off\"* (which I don't think is right, but I've been pg and hormonal and huge..... you are just not yourself when your body is demanding food for an unborn baby you're carrying), you get angry too.\n6. You leave to cool down (which I don't disagree with)\n7. When your wife comes down from her emotional hormone wave, and calls and begs you to come back, where you two can talk this out, you do not give her grace but tell the woman CARRYING YOUR CHILD to *\"F off\"*\n\nMy friend, wait until you're sleep deprived with a newborn. You need to get some conflict resolution skills NOW - both of you, but especially you, the person whose body and hormonal balance haven't been out of whack for 7 months with 2 to go.\n\nApologize to her and learn to control your temper... this is a temporary situation, and let me tell you it is difficult to be pg and often miserable.

Good luck.", "I'll be honest, I was a complete AH during my first pregnancy to term. After a couple of miscarriages,  I was so stressed out during my pregnancy. Even towards the end, I was freaking out all the time. It made it almost impossible to regulate any emotions, and outbursts were common. \n\nI went into labor during a snow storm, and we had to drive 20 miles through an area with no cell service and 6 inches of snow. I was convinced that I was going to end having the baby in the car because we'd wreck. My hubby drove safe, but I was inconsolable for most of the trip. Every contraction I had, I would threaten divorce because \"he didn't care about the safety of me or our baby.\" Looking back, we can laugh about it, but at the time, it was so hard to go through.\n\nI'm not saying that pregnancy is an excuse necessarily, but it can make it harder to control emotions when you are in the moment.\n\nI was much better with my second pregnancy to term, thank goodness. \n\nOP, if your wife isn't typically like this, remember the \"real\" her is in there somewhere, and she is probably frustrated with herself as well.
