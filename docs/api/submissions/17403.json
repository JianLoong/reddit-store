We\u2019re not super close, but we\u2019re friendly, and get together with the same group of friends a lot. She called and said that her kids were talking about how much fun they have with mine, and wanted to know if we were free this coming Saturday (a week and a half away, at the time). My kids really do like her kids, and I want to be better friends with her as well, so I said sure! She was relieved, and said her husband would be out of town and she needed a babysitter from 8 AM to 10PM.  I felt like it was a major bait and switch, because I thought she wanted to do something all together, but I felt bad backing out when I had already told her I was completely free that day. I should have said something right then, but I didn\u2019t. \n\nWell yesterday, I ran into a friend of mine and she asked if I was excited for Saturday. I thought that was weird, because no, I\u2019m not excited to babysit someone else\u2019s kids for 14 hours. But I said my kids were definitely excited. She said \u201coh good! Is your husband taking them to do something fun? Or who is watching them?\u201d To which I made a face and responded that *I* was watching them, and then she was the one who was confused, and said \u201cso you\u2019re not coming?\u201d\nWell, last week I didn\u2019t go to the end of year PTA meeting because I had just started my period and I felt crummy and didn\u2019t want to go. \nI guess after the fact, some friends went out to lunch. They decided to plan a big girls day to relax before the kids are back home all day for the summer. Going to the city, shopping, pedicures, eating at nice restaurants, etc., and when it was brought up that I would probably love to go too, this \u201cfriend\u201d said she needed to talk to me about some PTA stuff I missed so she would tell me about it when she called me. But instead, she decided to use me as her babysitter. \n\nSo I called the \u201cfriend\u201d and told her I wasn\u2019t aware of the girls day at the time, and that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch her kids after all. She asked if my husband could watch her kids too, which was a NO. She started crying that she really needed this, and what would she do now since her husband won\u2019t be home and it\u2019s too late to find someone willing to watch 5 kids for 14 hours (with no pay) and then once the tears weren\u2019t working, she just got angry. She said it was rude to back out of a commitment just so I could selfishly do something fun, and how I\u2019m an awful friend. \n\nMy friends are all feeling super uncomfortable with the whole thing. We\u2019re all typically a very happy, drama free friend group, so I know no one wants to take sides, and now I\u2019m wondering if I even go at all. \n\nSo AITA for backing out of watching her kids when I committed to it already?", "created_utc": 1684259552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jc5wt/aita_for_backing_out_of_babysitting_a_friends/", "score": 1651, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can phrase it nicely too as in \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I thought this was a playdate and that is too much time commitment on my own, good luck finding care and we\u2019ll plan a different activity next time\u201d. \n\nYou have to nip that in the bud and it\u2019s okay to pretend confusion.", "This is great advice - thank you for sharing your framing cos I need help with this too.", "Fair points. I just hesitate to lend any credence to the idea that she \u201casked\u201d OP to babysit and then OP backed out when that isn\u2019t really what happened, but to be fair I am NOT a subtle person and would have gone off on a \u201ccan you believe this b*tch?!?\u201d rant the second the other friend told me what was happening., so my approach is definitely not for everyone.", "You obviously looked at my comment history,  so you clearly see that I don't only call out bots, I also post my own comments. \n\nThe posts I call out as \"name is a bot\" are all comments that were stolen and copied and pasted from real commenters. The mods agree, which is why these comments get removed.\n\nSure, some bots don't get a ton of karma,  but they get enough to persuade people to fall for their scams and they should be eliminated. The mods agree which is why I (and other bot hunters) have been given moderator awards for our efforts.\n\nFinally, the mods have changed the sub's layout so that after a post is removed, everything under it collapses. So just let it stay collapsed and ignore it if bot hunting bothers you so much.", "...what the hell", "NTA she manipulated you don\u2019t feel bad that was really shitty on her part", "Lady tried to dump 5 extra kids on you. Naw.", "NTA. Honestly that was so wrong of her on so many levels. Hell, she could have even thought of maybe rotating?? She didn\u2019t even bring that up. She wanted an escape. The fact that she asked you, someone you don\u2019t know well, says she doesn\u2019t have friends or babysitters because she is a liar.", "NTA which should be obvious.\n\nAnd, nit-picky me - it's not possible for \"this coming Saturday\" to be \"a week and a half away\". \"This coming Saturday\" would be half a week away.", "I think you need to assess what you expect out of the friends' reactions. You are upset that they aren't more upset. How would they show that? By s-talking this manipulative friend? If you are a more casual group that just gets together for polite company, it doesn't mean that they aren't your \"friends\"- just not those level of friends. Not every group/member has the capacity to tangle with manipulative, from their perspective-petty drama. They hmay be fine if you show up. There might be misinformation about the situation. Who knows? But if your only problem is that they aren''t more externally upset about this and/or reprimanding her (in a way that you also know about)- that really wouldn't be fair, would it if that relationship wasn't established. NTA for backing out though", "Send your friends group this thread let them read and understand.", "NTA. At all!", "NTA. You were manipulated and lied to. Keep this women at a arms length and go enjoy the Saturday", "NTA. But for any friends that don't want to get involved, just send them a link to this story. It will be clear why you are not happy with the person who pretends to be your friend.", "NTA. Let me get this straight. This \"friend\" was supposed to call you and tell you about a girl's day out with the group. Instead, she calls, doesn't say anything about the girl's day out, and instead gets you to agree to babysit her kids on that day - ?\n\nSweetie, she is an awful friend. Upon getting the whole story, you should have called her and told her you wouldn't babysit because of her deceitfulness. You no longer consider her a friend or someone you would do favors for. She cheated you out of a group activity when she was expected to invite you to it. She is not your friend. If the others aren't angry with her for how she treated you, I'm not so sure they are your friends either.\n\nYou are not just backing out of a commitment. You are refusing to do a favor for someone who tried to screw you over.", "NTA. Make it clear to your other friends that you were tricked (the bait and switch( and that your friend withheld information from you. Your friend is acting out of line.", "You are NTA in this situation!\n\nThe lying jackass of a \"friend\" who lied to EVERYONE involved, did a bait and switch, to get you to watch her 5 kids for 14 hour for free totally is an AH!  Gal has a set on her for trying to pull this off.  The crying when found out is just the icing on the gtfo cake in my opinion.\n\nI bet anything if you fell for it this time she'd insist on being your only point of contact for events.", "I said it was a week and a half away, at the time. Because this happened a week ago. It is now half a week away.  But I might have worded it poorly.", "She was trying to keep OP from coming on the trip. Why else would she lie and try to get her to babysit. She's not a friend at all. Ask the other friends why it's OK that she not only tricked you but tried to keep you from going. NTA", "Yeah, and I might have been my usual pedant-self, sticking my nose into something that didn't really warrant it. My apologies. What you say above is perfectly reasonable.\n\nAnd NTA, of course.", "No apologies needed!", "Absolutely agree: the lying lady is TA. \nApparently I wasn't clear enough about that, according to the down votes.", ">what would she do now...\n\nLook after her own kids that's what.", "nta she is not your friend", ">She said it was rude to back out of a commitment just so I could selfishly do something fun\n\nAh, like how she backed out of telling you about girls day so that she could get a free babysitter out of you and do something selfishly fun?\n\n\nNTA", "She definitely sounds like the type to suggest that \"you'll only be taking care of the younger two\", but actually even the older ones need tons of help, or bother the younger ones, or will do something obviously dangerous that the babysitter will be held liable for. \nSide note: I had a babysitting family who only paid for their three youngest kids, not the oldest, but he was like 12 at the time, super chill, out of the house for at least half the time, and didn't bother anyone at all.", "Yep. NTA op", "Maybe have a good chat first to really see who was told what..then if they still don't care enough about you to be upset on your behalf and support you, ditch the lot and do what you want. Who needs friends like that.", "NTA- Watching 5 kids for 14 hours and no pay?", "NTA \nIt don\u2019t think it matters that you backed out - I would have too. She knowingly used you by not inviting you (like she said to the others) to the event and instead asked if you\u2019d babysit for her with no compensation. If you ask me, she is the selfish one.", "Probably because they are embarrassed by the situation and how the other mother is acting. Probably don't want to say anything in support of your position in case you tell the other mum they support you. Saying nothing means they don't have to touch the poop that is this situation and don't get any of it on them. \n\nBest way to avoid drama is to not get involved in it. So not saying anything for or against it, is their way of saying they want no part in it. Also by telling you she lied to them about letting you know, is their way of telling you what they believed was the case. \n\nI've had similar situations with my friends who aren't that close to me and I just steer clear of it. If they were a good mate, I would speak my mind, but people I only see occasionally I'd just avoid the drama and hope it dies out. \n\nCommenting on it means taking a side. Taking a side means drama.", "Also remember that finding it hard to say no to requests is pretty normal. Humans have evolved to be social and cooperative creatures, and many of us have a strong inbuilt sense of social obligation that's hard to override with our \"logical\" brains. Toxic people don't feel this so strongly, but they learn pretty early on that others do, and they use that to  manipulate people. \n\nYour \"friend\" knew that it would be hard for you to say no at all, and she also knew she could make it extra hard by first getting you to agree that your kids really liked each other, then getting you to say you were free. She also put you on the spot with the bait and switch so you didn't have time to think. These tactics all add  psychological barriers to saying no. It's exactly the kind of thing that dodgy salespeople do.\n\nWorking on saying no after you've been skillfully manipulated is a bit like working on self-defence after you got mugged. Probably a good thing to do, but don't slip into thinking it makes you morally responsible for the situation.", "NTA Wow. She's a monster. Get rid of her and her kids!", "If I was in this situation and feeling extra spunky....\n\nI would have got a babysitter for my children for this day, canceled last minute on the \"friend,\" and if she dared to say something, call her out for being deceitful and a user.\n\nSucks when tables get turned on you...\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Let me get this right. There is a mums day out. Child free mums day out. You weren\u2019t there when it was planned. So this person said she would tell you about it. BUT instead she got you to agree to watch her kids so she could go and NOT tell you about it. \nOk so it sucks for her she can\u2019t go BUT that\u2019s HER problem. She is a major AH for how she treated you. You are NTA. If your hubby can watch your kids then you should go and enjoy it.", "BABYSITTING 5 KIDS FOR 14 HOURS???!!!!! IS SHE INSANE????? Yes that\u2019s me yelling. Jesus, I don\u2019t think if could do that even if paid. NTA.", "NTA. I remember this happening on Friends, Ross thought he and his kid had a play date w a hot chick and he was the babysitter.\n\nI have learned that when someone asks if you're busy on a given day to always ask why because they invariably want you to do something you won't want to do.\n\nIt's unreasonable to manipulate someone into watching 5 kids for 14 hours without paying them $50/hr.\n\nNTA but this woman definitely is because instead of telling you about the girls day she decided you should be her free babysitter.\n\nShe's definitely TA and I hope you still retain your other friends. I wouldn't want to be friends with her", "NTA, don\u2019t have 5 kids and it\u2019s easier to manage this types of emergency babysitting situations without straight up lying and manipulating your friends.", "NTA - Well now you know, she isn\u2019t your friend but a user! \n\nGo enjoy the day knowing she\u2019s not there and if anyone asks, make sure they are aware of the stunt she pulled!", "I bet they won't.  They'll be thinking about keeping the status quo for themselves, for now, and will at some point get mad at OP for \"rocking the boat\" even though it's totally justified.  If they were going to be mad at the liar, they already would be.", "she can 'need' a nice day out but screwing someone in her friend group over to try to get it is incredibly rude. IMO anyone who would do that probably does alot of other shady shit as well. if she's in such dire need of time away from the kids (which i can totally understand; having 5 young children must be exhausting), she can hire a babysitter. or if that's too pricey, find someone willing to do it who knows what they're getting into & isn't being tricked. frankly, she sounds insufferable. i hope OP & the other friends cut her off."]}
