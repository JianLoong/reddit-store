We\u2019re not super close, but we\u2019re friendly, and get together with the same group of friends a lot. She called and said that her kids were talking about how much fun they have with mine, and wanted to know if we were free this coming Saturday (a week and a half away, at the time). My kids really do like her kids, and I want to be better friends with her as well, so I said sure! She was relieved, and said her husband would be out of town and she needed a babysitter from 8 AM to 10PM.  I felt like it was a major bait and switch, because I thought she wanted to do something all together, but I felt bad backing out when I had already told her I was completely free that day. I should have said something right then, but I didn\u2019t. \n\nWell yesterday, I ran into a friend of mine and she asked if I was excited for Saturday. I thought that was weird, because no, I\u2019m not excited to babysit someone else\u2019s kids for 14 hours. But I said my kids were definitely excited. She said \u201coh good! Is your husband taking them to do something fun? Or who is watching them?\u201d To which I made a face and responded that *I* was watching them, and then she was the one who was confused, and said \u201cso you\u2019re not coming?\u201d\nWell, last week I didn\u2019t go to the end of year PTA meeting because I had just started my period and I felt crummy and didn\u2019t want to go. \nI guess after the fact, some friends went out to lunch. They decided to plan a big girls day to relax before the kids are back home all day for the summer. Going to the city, shopping, pedicures, eating at nice restaurants, etc., and when it was brought up that I would probably love to go too, this \u201cfriend\u201d said she needed to talk to me about some PTA stuff I missed so she would tell me about it when she called me. But instead, she decided to use me as her babysitter. \n\nSo I called the \u201cfriend\u201d and told her I wasn\u2019t aware of the girls day at the time, and that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch her kids after all. She asked if my husband could watch her kids too, which was a NO. She started crying that she really needed this, and what would she do now since her husband won\u2019t be home and it\u2019s too late to find someone willing to watch 5 kids for 14 hours (with no pay) and then once the tears weren\u2019t working, she just got angry. She said it was rude to back out of a commitment just so I could selfishly do something fun, and how I\u2019m an awful friend. \n\nMy friends are all feeling super uncomfortable with the whole thing. We\u2019re all typically a very happy, drama free friend group, so I know no one wants to take sides, and now I\u2019m wondering if I even go at all. \n\nSo AITA for backing out of watching her kids when I committed to it already?", "created_utc": 1684259552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jc5wt/aita_for_backing_out_of_babysitting_a_friends/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she'd asked you to babysit while she went out with your mutual friends, that would have been a dick move. But she really compounded it by *lying to the friend group* and saying that she'd invite you, then basically disinviting you instead. \n\nAlso, yeah, the way she asked was a bait and switch... though it's the least of the issues here so let's leave that aside. \n\nSo then you find out what's going on, you are not pleased, and it sounds like you did not react well, OP. \n\nThe \\*best\\* option would have been to think through the situation, foresee the potential impact to the friend group, and react with a resolution in mind. Without knowing you or the group, I can't say exactly what that might have been. One option might have been: You call up the friend and say, \"I don't think you handled this well but let's make it right. What if we hire a babysitter and split the cost? What if we \\[insert alternate solution here\\]?\"\n\nThe meh option would have been to highlight the friend's bad behavior without engaging in any of your own. For example: sending a group email to all the girls and saying, \"I'm so upset with this situation and don't know what to do. Any suggestions?\" -- you'd create some drama that way but maybe someone would have had a great solution.\n\nThe \\*asshole\\* option was to refuse to babysit at the very last minute, expecting the friend to drop out of the girl's day, and then go yourself. Pure tit-for-tat with predictable results in a friend group.", "NTA the bait and switch was bad enough then this became worse than how I originally thought this story was going.\n\nIt\u2019s probably for the best that this happened and she showed her true colors so that you didn\u2019t get sucked into a one sided friendship as I would bet she would pull this stuff a lot and most likely takes advantage of those around her.\n\nShe can find a sitter local and will just have to pay for 14 hours!  You are so kind to even decide to do that for free.  That\u2019s a long day with a lot of kids.", "NTA. She didn't tell you about the plans so you could babysit while she had fun, but she's calling you selfish because you can attend without needing a babysitter. Your friends are uncomfortable because she showed them what kind of person she is. Block her. She is not your friend, or she would have told you about the day and offered to take your kids so she could do this. It's called honesty and compromise. It's what friends do.", "NTA she conned you into babysitting under false pretenses.  She was suppose to tell you about the outing but did not.

I\u2019m definitely not the most involved in the friend group, so I\u2019m guessing she was just straight up crossing her fingers I didn\u2019t end up hearing about it?", "Guessing she would tell everybody OP volunteered to babysit for the day.", "Do they know the full story of what happened? \n\nBased on what your other friend asked, conwoman clearly implied to them that your husband would be watching kids and not that you weren\u2019t going on the trip so they assumed you were. \n\nIt\u2019s possible they don\u2019t know she presented it as a play date, conned you into 14 hours of free babysitting, and never mentioned the girls day invite as promised. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t write them off yet because it sounds like the artful dodger gave them a deceitfully abridged version of events.", "You could try talking to some of them one on one and ask what they think.
