We\u2019re not super close, but we\u2019re friendly, and get together with the same group of friends a lot. She called and said that her kids were talking about how much fun they have with mine, and wanted to know if we were free this coming Saturday (a week and a half away, at the time). My kids really do like her kids, and I want to be better friends with her as well, so I said sure! She was relieved, and said her husband would be out of town and she needed a babysitter from 8 AM to 10PM.  I felt like it was a major bait and switch, because I thought she wanted to do something all together, but I felt bad backing out when I had already told her I was completely free that day. I should have said something right then, but I didn\u2019t. \n\nWell yesterday, I ran into a friend of mine and she asked if I was excited for Saturday. I thought that was weird, because no, I\u2019m not excited to babysit someone else\u2019s kids for 14 hours. But I said my kids were definitely excited. She said \u201coh good! Is your husband taking them to do something fun? Or who is watching them?\u201d To which I made a face and responded that *I* was watching them, and then she was the one who was confused, and said \u201cso you\u2019re not coming?\u201d\nWell, last week I didn\u2019t go to the end of year PTA meeting because I had just started my period and I felt crummy and didn\u2019t want to go. \nI guess after the fact, some friends went out to lunch. They decided to plan a big girls day to relax before the kids are back home all day for the summer. Going to the city, shopping, pedicures, eating at nice restaurants, etc., and when it was brought up that I would probably love to go too, this \u201cfriend\u201d said she needed to talk to me about some PTA stuff I missed so she would tell me about it when she called me. But instead, she decided to use me as her babysitter. \n\nSo I called the \u201cfriend\u201d and told her I wasn\u2019t aware of the girls day at the time, and that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch her kids after all. She asked if my husband could watch her kids too, which was a NO. She started crying that she really needed this, and what would she do now since her husband won\u2019t be home and it\u2019s too late to find someone willing to watch 5 kids for 14 hours (with no pay) and then once the tears weren\u2019t working, she just got angry. She said it was rude to back out of a commitment just so I could selfishly do something fun, and how I\u2019m an awful friend. \n\nMy friends are all feeling super uncomfortable with the whole thing. We\u2019re all typically a very happy, drama free friend group, so I know no one wants to take sides, and now I\u2019m wondering if I even go at all. \n\nSo AITA for backing out of watching her kids when I committed to it already?", "created_utc": 1684259552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jc5wt/aita_for_backing_out_of_babysitting_a_friends/", "score": 480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she'd asked you to babysit while she went out with your mutual friends, that would have been a dick move. But she really compounded it by *lying to the friend group* and saying that she'd invite you, then basically disinviting you instead. \n\nAlso, yeah, the way she asked was a bait and switch... though it's the least of the issues here so let's leave that aside. \n\nSo then you find out what's going on, you are not pleased, and it sounds like you did not react well, OP. \n\nThe \\*best\\* option would have been to think through the situation, foresee the potential impact to the friend group, and react with a resolution in mind. Without knowing you or the group, I can't say exactly what that might have been. One option might have been: You call up the friend and say, \"I don't think you handled this well but let's make it right. What if we hire a babysitter and split the cost? What if we \\[insert alternate solution here\\]?\"\n\nThe meh option would have been to highlight the friend's bad behavior without engaging in any of your own. For example: sending a group email to all the girls and saying, \"I'm so upset with this situation and don't know what to do. Any suggestions?\" -- you'd create some drama that way but maybe someone would have had a great solution.\n\nThe \\*asshole\\* option was to refuse to babysit at the very last minute, expecting the friend to drop out of the girl's day, and then go yourself. Pure tit-for-tat with predictable results in a friend group.", "NTA the bait and switch was bad enough then this became worse than how I originally thought this story was going.\n\nIt\u2019s probably for the best that this happened and she showed her true colors so that you didn\u2019t get sucked into a one sided friendship as I would bet she would pull this stuff a lot and most likely takes advantage of those around her.\n\nShe can find a sitter local and will just have to pay for 14 hours!

She lied to you and your friend group to trick you into letting her go on a day out that was intended for all of you. You need to shine up your spine and hold her accountable for her lies. She is manipulative and selfish for the way she acted. Especially because she told the group she was going to tell you, only to lie and then lie again to get you to watch her kids for 14 hours!!! Stop apologizing for her.", "It was rude of her to lie.. don\u2019t feel bad this is exactly what she deserves.. and honestly she\u2019s not a friend but a user.. stay away\nNta", "NTA", "NTA\u2026.if it gets brought up I would start with yea, it really hurt my feelings that originally she asked if a I was free to spend time together on Saturday, then she said it was just going to be me babysitting her 5 kids from 8am to 10pm because she needed a sitter cause her husband was out of town. Then I found out she was actually supposed to let me know about this girls day and instead of passing that along she just kept that a secret. I really do like her and her kids but this just really made me feel like I was being lied to and taken advantage of and then was verbally abusive when I tried to speak with her about it. I\u2019m so sorry everyone got roped into this unfortunate event, I never wanted to make you all uncomfortable and cause you stress. This is supposed to be break time for us all to get a bit of a breather and have some adult time.

In what reality would you be the AH?", "NTA\nThe friends should be taking sides. This lady lied to them and tricked OP. That\u2019s shady behavior. It\u2019s *user* behavior. \n\nI\u2019d be sitting the other ladies down and saying \u201cyou realize she lied to you right? And then left me out of the group activity? And tricked me? And y\u2019all are ok with this? You are fine with someone treating *me* that way? Will you be down when she starts treating *you* that way?\u201d", "No, she didn't *ask* OP to babysit. She asked if OP was free and then told her she'd be babysitting 5 kids for 14 hours for free.", "This happened to me, I used to be so helpful and accommodating, coworker and I worked Monday through Friday, she worked on the weekend to earn extra money as a single mom. One workday she complained because her regular babysitter wasn't available, I offered to help her that weekend and refused her payment of $15.00.\n\n Problem is that she expected me to babysit every weekend from then on and dummy me kept babysitting for her, until I realized as a family we could no longer go out or visit hubby's family (my family lived in another state). I told her I would no longer babysit for her, coworker became angry and told me she had no one else to babysit and I would have to continue babysitting. I said not happening and didn't babysit for her anymore.", "A whole essay that OP probs won\u2019t even acknowledge \ud83e\udd23", "It's not on OP to help someone who lied and manipulated her find childcare. OP is well with her right to say you know what, you are shady and I don't owe you anything. No one is an asshole for changing their mind after finding out they are being used. Your suggestions just make you sound like a pushover.", "NTA At All", "I\u2019d reword the \u201casked you to babysit\u201d to make it clear that what she really did is invite you over only to admit (after you\u2019d agreed ) she wasn\u2019t going to be there and you\u2019d be responsible for her kids as well as her own. You can still keep it light, like oh it\u2019s just another part of this very strange mixup.", "They think she is nice for now. As soon as she pulls this same stunt on them, they will like her a lot less.", "One of my favorite lines from Into the Woods is \"nice is different than good.\"", "And you know she's the type to be posting it all over instagram or something too.  Selfish, and a little stupid, it sounds.", "Exactly this! She proposed what any reasonable person would interpret as a play date invitation, THEN revealed OP had agreed to something entirely different.\n\nFive kids for 14 hours. The audacity!!", "You're probably very much part of the group, but I wouldn't expect them to be the friends you want them to be. \n\nIt sounds to me like this is just a social group where everyone tries their best to get along. \n\nThese aren't your best friends, and they're not your ride or dies. \n\nLike, if you were closer than a superficial gathering of convenience, wouldn't you have known about this get together well beforehand? \n\nI think these people are acting in the best interest for the group by not fueling the fire. They aren't going to kick her out nor will they make you feel bad for declining to babysit. \n\nThey're not your friends, but they're also not your enemies. This is the kind of shit you complain about to your husband, family, or any close friends you've managed to stay in contact with over the years.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d is an extremely solid reason, and does not need to be verbalized. \n\n\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d is fine too. You can\u2019t because you don\u2019t want to. No need to elaborate further than can\u2019t.\n\nETA: the way I stopped doing unnecessary favours for people was a lil mental gymnastics. I asked myself that if I asked someone to do something, and they did it despite not wanting to, do I really want that person doing something begrudgingly or making their own life difficult for my sake? I did not, and the thought of people doing things for me because they couldn\u2019t say no was pretty distressing. So I told myself, I will say no to things I don\u2019t want to do, because I assume people don\u2019t want me feeling put out to do things for them, and those that don\u2019t care if I\u2019m put out certainly do not deserve favours from me.\n\nObviously there are some extenuating circumstances where people should help each other, but this certainly does not apply to what\u2019s happening here.", "I get that - my mother is like that exactly, and I used to be like that.  But your life will be immensely better once you do learn to say no if it doesn\u2019t suit you. For me, part of it was different strategies (like how to word it) because it never wanted to be harsh but also wanted to achieve properly saying no. Once I had those down, it became much easier.", "I think the impact to the friend group was highly predictable here. i am not suggesting the solution for the benefit of the asshole friend--but if OP wants the friend group to survive, she should have taken a different tack.", "And it\u2019s 5 kids! Not just 1 or 2. Makes it even worse. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019m honestly wondering if I even want to go at this point.", "I would be VERY careful about doing this. It makes it look very \u2018I\u2019m the one causing drama\u2019 and that\u2019ll make her look more like a victim. I would give a more detailed story (still light) to only one or two friends, definitely not at the beginning of the day - perhaps to towards the end, in a sort of \u2018im a bit hurt, actually\u2019 way. It\u2019ll get around, and OP won\u2019t look like she\u2019s talking shit for revenge.", "Man that line hit me so hard the first time I heard it.", "I think you are pretty spot on. These are friends that I get together with because we happen to live in close proximity. We live out in the middle of no where, no where near any of my family or friends growing up. I\u2019m grateful to them because they get me out of the house, which can be hard for me sometimes. But they\u2019re not ones I cry my heart out to, for sure.", "Right, and to make it all worse it's so she can offload the kids and go to the girls day out that she was supposedly going to tell OP was invited to\n\nHaha wtf", "Definitely go, even if only just to be petty and spite her for trying to bait-and-switch.", "I would say try not to get angry at your friends until you've spent the day with them. They did think of you and intended to invite you initially. Have you been speaking in person or via text since then? Maybe they don't want to be gossipy via text.", "It could just be that they're conflict averse. So many people are. Still not cool though.", "For sure! It's a hard pill to swallow when you feel like you should be receiving more support, but sometimes a bit of perspective can help. \n\nI'm sorry this happened. I, for one, think this chick is a complete user and you were right to call her on her shit. \n\nMy boyfriend and I talk about posts like this and think it's crazy that such entitled people exist. \n\nBut at least you know who she is now!! \n\nYour best bet moving forward is to stay positive and don't be the problem. \n\nWith a group this passive she isn't going to get any support for her shitty cause either. \ud83d\ude07", "I agree with this, I think they're getting a load of BS from this other woman's side, and OP should stand her ground and go, and have fun.", "Completely agree. I\u2019ve had a similar thing happen before and unfortunately I\u2019ve found that the first person to make their case usually controls the narrative. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re right. Doesn\u2019t matter if the other person is crazy. DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender) is powerful.\n\nGive your other friends a chance. Some may surprise you and rush to your side. Some may not and you\u2019ll know to be wary in the future.\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP that such a crummy thing happened to you. Sending virtual hugs.", "Your \"friend\" lied and manipulated you.  She IS NOT your friend at all and DO NOT do any favors for you because she IS NOT your friend.  You are NTA", "NTA! She intentionally didn\u2019t tell you about the trip after volunteering to be the one to notify you. Then, she TRICKED you into babysitting so that\u2019s she could attend the trip she was purposely excluding you from for her own benefit. This woman isn\u2019t your friend. And if she\u2019d be this shady and dishonest with you, none of the other women in the group should trust her either. The others in the friend group need to know the dishonesty part of this. If they DO know and are still \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d they\u2019re nota so great either.", "NTA. What\u2019s to feel uncomfortable about? \n\nShe was outed as an egotistical opportunistic liar. \n\nWhy would you, any of you, still want to have anything to do with let alone hang out with someone like that?", "NTA.  She was shady in how she asked you and doesn't deserve your free labor.  Her family can watch them", "NTA. That person is obviously not your friend, she lied to you and wanted to use you. You owe her absolutely nothing.", "Nta, she tricked you and lied to the rest of the group. She is not your friend", "She's slimy.  NTA", "ESH \n\nShame on her for asking you the way she did but u should have said something at the moment she ambushed you, and you still had a few days to do that. Not only because you found something better to do but to not open a precedent.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nShe isn\u2019t your friend!\n\nLol. She lied and excluded you so she could have a fun day and you could baby sit. Lol. Stuff her. Maybe ask her if she wants to have your kids since she isn\u2019t going out now", "NTA, I was already on your side and then I read 5 kids!  That is way too long to leave that many kids at some else's house without them enthusiastically offering to babysit.", "NTA, and pas, your \u201cfriends\u201d not picking a side, is in fact them choosing a side. Because this is pretty black and white, the other woman used you. There\u2019s no \u201cboth sides\u201d \ud83e\udd74", "NTA\n\nShe is not your close friend. She wanted you to watch her 5 children for 14 hours with your kids. She trapped you into agreeing before giving details. She was supposed to tell you about the group plan but did not. She was in no way respectful of you as a friend or a babysitter.", "Agreed. That woman was rude first by telling everyone that she would tell you about the special \"girls day out\", but changing her story to you into an unpaid bait & switch babysitting gig...\n\nShe had it coming. OP is totally NTA.", "Honestly OP should ask \u201cfriend\u201d if she will watch her kids now that she is home all day. It will be fun. The kids will love it", "Let\u2019s also remember that she says she can\u2019t afford a babysitter but apparently can afford a day of shopping, spa and salon treatments etc so it\u2019s just another lie. It sounds like  r/p9nultimat9 is absolutely on the money and this lady has already been blacklisted from all local babysitters \n\nNTA", "*And* extra, extra points because she was trying to trick OP into watching *five* kids for 14 hours for *free*.", "This! \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "I could not agree more. Get angry with them all op and call them all out! Good luck, I\u2019m sorry that you are dealing with this.", "Agreed, but that woman with five kids probably does *really* need a girls day. Hope her husband and children did something nice for Mother\u2019s Day.", "People like this are extra super nice right before the grift. It\u2019s how people don\u2019t see it coming.", "I really feel what you\u2019re saying and I think you\u2019re handling this in a very mature way. But I would suggest maybe talking to one person in the group you feel most close to. I think the reason they aren\u2019t as outraged about it is because they may not know the whole story or your side of things. If you tell one of them about it and how upset you are about being lied to and manipulated in that way, it may clear things up. \n\nThe \u201cfriend\u201d you mentioned sounds quite manipulative and fake (in that she\u2019s nice to everyone yet has malicious intents). So it may not be as easy to see through that for your other friends who weren\u2019t directly involved. Sharing your side will definitely help. And if it doesn\u2019t change their stance, I think you\u2019d have given them a fair chance and realize they aren\u2019t really worth your time and loyalty.", "Really?  If this happened in my friend group, we would have OPs back and be upset with the person who lied and manipulated everyone, not just op. If you have to tip toe around issues and volunteer to help the manipulative asshole who tried to lie her way into 14 hours of free childcare to keep the peace,  maybe those aren't the friends for her. \n\nOp is definitely not an asshole for backing out of a day of hellthat she was manipulated into.", "Agreed. Your friends are probably polite, not wanting to gossip, don\u2019t want to insert themselves in the drama, aren\u2019t quite sure of what\u2019s going on as this is very, very bizarre behavior and are trying to stay out of this when hearing two completely different stories. I bet if you were to go and explain yourself dogmatically and factually without getting heated, they would empathize with you immediately.", "Talk to them first. I know someone like this who sort of commands and demand everyone else\u2019s loyalty, whereas individually / away from her they all happily recognise she\u2019s annoying.\n\nIf they agree then you can ask them not about taking sides but just be clear that she tried to play everyone and so they all should be equally annoyed and see what they say", "My angle here is that we can think two steps ahead, and act with the big picture in mind.\n\nIf OP wanted to ditch/dissolve this friend group, then she can pat herself on the back for a job well done.\n\nIf the OP wants this friend group to survive, however, she made that more difficult.\n\nI'm not dinging OP for backing out of the babysitting. She absolutely should not have gone through with the asshole friend's plan. But, IMO, people who don't look at the big picture & escalate drama are contributing to it.", "And what's even worse, she plotted this from the beginning! That's why she volunteered to \"tell\" OP.", "I mean,  you said in your initial comment that the asshole option was what OP did, although you added some additional drama for funnsies. So yeah, seems like you are dinging her. \n\nOp didn't blow up the friend group, the liar did. She didn't escalate the drama either. Your comments are actually bordering on victim blaming and they are really confirming my initial response which is you sound like a pushover.", "Maybe this is clearer: \n\nShe absolutely should not have gone through with the asshole friend's plan.\n\nHaving decided not to babysit, she had a whole range of options to choose from, some more diplomatic than others. \n\nShe *could* have avoided putting the friend group in a position of having to take sides, which is a situation that makes most friend groups uncomfortable/unhappy and spoils the fun of gatherings.\n\nBut instead she made sure the asshole friend would have something to complain about, too, and just generally maximized unhappiness for everyone.\n\nTerrible choice, so everyone sucks now."]}
