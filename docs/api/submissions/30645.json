This is a good wake-up call.  $3000 on a trip when your wife is pregnant is an insane thing to do.  Print out a list of all the things you have to buy for the baby, all the hospital and doctors bills (assuming you're US based and therefore will have to spend a lot of money on this) and then a breakdown of your reduced earnings due to any maternity leave and rain it down on him like the wrath of god.  Also remind him as he thinks he should get to go on the trip it's only fair that he also needs to find the money out of his allowance to take you on a Babymoon and get a push present.", "$3000 for a four day trip for one sounds outrageously expensive. NTA", "YWNBTA, but realize that this should come across as a conversation, not a demand.\n\nSo at the core, communication is key, and he failed to do that. Spending that much money on an undoubtedly fun, but purely-for-him trip out of a shared account without making sure it was ok first is asshole behavior. \n\nI am not sure I would phrase it as \"I want you to cancel the trip\" - you don't seem to have any problem with the trip itself - but make sure it's \"I'm a bit upset that you were planning to do this without discussing it with me\" and \"I need you to have a plan in place to make sure you 'pay back' the joint account before we need it for (baby/house/whatever) - otherwise there will not be a shared account at all.\"", "NTA for being frustrated.  He ought have discussed it with you. \n\nBut is there no compromise here?  Maybe he takes half out of the joint account, and half out of his account?  You post reads as though you really consider you shared account to be YOUR account because you earn more. And as though he isn\u2019t untitled to occasionally spend money on something he will really enjoy. \n\nI\u2019d urge you to use this as a clarifying moment. Don\u2019t demand that he cancel - as you point out, he won\u2019t be able to do this again for some time, and I think yes, YWBTA.  It reads like asking him to cancel would be an ask born from frustration, and that\u2019s never the path of wisdom. But maybe jointly make a decision about a level at which purchases from your joint assets need to be discussed?", "Here is how I would approach: IF it is actually going to take a large chunk out of finances, yes you should ask him to cancel the trip. You didn't know where the money was coming from, and the money in that account belongs to BOTH of you- therefore, it shouldn't be spent, especially in large amounts, unless you both agree.   \n\n\nIf it really isn't a HUGE deal for the money to be spent, I would let him go, but I would have a stern conversation about him needing to put that money back ASAP (maybe contributing a larger amount every paycheck to the account) and that going forward, there needs to be a discussion prior to the money being spent on something because you are married and you share that money.", "YWNBTA\n\nLook. As others said this should be a conversation.\n\nIt's the holiday season - can he pick up some seasonal work that would cover much if not all the cost?\n\nBc yeah. $3000 is 100 weeks of his FUN money. So... two years worth. And that is fair - he can make that choice - but you really need to be clear that, given baby and minimum wage - this isn't a small amount he can just help himself to.\n\nAlternately, you agree that - short of actively giving birth - he gets to go to the wedding in April by himself. You have plenty of time to figure out a few days of support for yourself so that he can be there for that.", "YWNBTA\nI\u2019d have the conversation with him now, while he still has plenty of time to save up his 30 per week towards this trip.", "YWNBTA.

With a baby on the way you do have to decide where money goes. Rather than outright telling him he can't go, can you put to him the reasons you are worried about spending so much money on a vacation at the moment?

I don't know if you need to jump right to \"cancel the trip\" - maybe if it's a priority and paying it back over time is feasible, it can be allowed.  But this is not the kind of thing you decide on without your partner.  He should have come to you and said \"I think I'm going to need to use some joint money for this trip, can we talk about it?\"  And that's a respect thing.\n\nMaybe it wasn't intentional.  Maybe he thought that you having been supportive about the trip meant that he thought you were okay with this.  \n\nI hope you don't need to say \"cancel the trip\" as the way to start that discussion.

If he\u2019s planning to \u201cpay it back\u201d overtime, what\u2019s his plan and do you think he\u2019d actually stick to it?

Have an open and honest talk with your husband about it! Are his friends more well off and maybe he\u2019s embarrassed and doesn\u2019t want to suggest a more cost friendly place?

This is how he can finance the trip (or reimburse you).", "So, he's planning to not spend a single dollar of the 30 a week that he gets, for 100 weeks straight, in order to pay this back, right?\n\nThat's where I would start with it OP. Does he not understand this is 2 YEARS worth of the fun allowance money that you guys set aside each week? Even if he only spends half, then what, for the next 4 years he's going to never spend more than 15 a week?\n\nTo me, if he has a legit plan to pay it back in a more timely fashion (maybe picking up a 2nd job for a few months or whatever) then probably ok, and I would say you should try and let him go, friends are important. If his plan is to pay you back over the next 5 years or so, 20 to 30 dollars a week, then hard no, if you need to save that long for a trip, it should be for the family.", "NTA.  If my husband decided unilaterally that he was going to spend thousands of dollars of our money on a solo trip, he would possibly come back to a separation.  That is so out of line.", "Before going anywhere you must have money. He has not saved up for the trip therefore it\u2019s a no go.", "NTA. I think you should reconsider how your finances are split!", "YWNBTA. He's planning to pay back $3k? Before the baby? Committing to this trip without talking to you about getting the money from the joint account is a problem.

This is so irresponsible of him.", "NTA. He is not living within his/your means.

And at this point there is no \u201chis money\u201d or \u201cjoint money\u201d when you\u2019re earning the majority of it and you have a kid on the way - every penny he makes needs to go toward the joint money for your family expenses. I\u2019m not even going into the obviously parts of him not even consulting you and making an executive decision, which would be bad either way but even more so when you\u2019re the primary breadwinner.", "NTA but there has to be a better solution- does he have $3,000? How is he planning on paying it back to the account? At $30 a month payback would be over 100 months,will he be picking up extra hours?Did he not discuss it because he knew you'd be upset? I think if he can come up with a workable payment plan that everyone is on board with fine, but otherwise it sucks to be an adult sometimes.", "NTA.

I also think using joint funds that weren\u2019t agreed upon to fund his vacation is wrong and puts you in a terrible spot - having to be or not to be the \u201cbad guy.\u201d  I would see if there is a way to have both the vacation and a way to make up the extra $3,000", "NTA, your husband cannot afford to go to Barbados and he never should have agreed to go without having the money for it from his separate fun money. Unless he is going to forego his fun money for the next 100 weeks and you agree to front him he has no business on that trip.", "NTA - absolutely NOT! He is never going to pay that money back! That\u2019s an insane amount for a boys trip! This is absolutely a hill worth dying on, especially since you are the primary provider.", "$300 for the honeymoon. And $3000, his share, for the boys trip. Tells you where his priorities lie. NTA.... You have a baby coming and you're gonna need that money.", "I was going to say Y T A until you said he\u2019s taking it out of your joint account. NTA it\u2019s his trip, he can spend his money and not the money meant for the family (ie: baby, house, cars, etc)", "Nta that joint money no his to frit away", "NTA\n\nHe can't afford a $3k trip to Barbados in January.\n\nAnd either get his name off the joint account or move that money to an account in your name only.", "A boy's weekend, for 4 days - $3k?!?! That is insane, there is no way 4 days costs $3k.  Is he getting a $750k hooker each night?\n\nNTA.", "NTA at all. He can't afford it. If he wants to afford it he needs a second job. You have an agreement about how a joint account is used,  you contribute more, sounds like you were amazingly reasonable about your wedding. \n\nI own my own business, make great money, own our house, and would NEVER spend that much on a 4 night trip, let alone take the $ from my wife for something like that with a kid in the way. \n\nHe has to tell his friends he's too broke, or start working nights in between to afford it.", "NTA. Is the $3000 including an every night cocktails or a trip to a casino?  The amount of money makes no sense for a boy with a part time job at the bowling alley. He needs to get a better paid job or a good side hustle. \n\nIf he goes, take the same amount of money and put it in your own saving account. Not to be used for baby, family or car. Consider it your escape fund.", "I\u2019d tell him to go but he has to pay out of his own account. Joint account means joint authorization and you are not authorizing this big expenditure right before the baby. If he doesn\u2019t agree and takes the money out of the joint account then you need to open your own account to protect your money.", "Reason number whatever of many of why I\u2019m Childfree. Cause kids are expensive and you gotta spend your money on them and not fun, self-centered stuff like bachelor parties. \n\nNTA", " I can't imagine spending $3000 without saying anything to my husband about it, and we can absolutely afford it.  We own our home outright and our children are grown. Your husband knew the trip cost too much, and that is why he didn't say anything to you about it.  Withholding important information about your joint account was deceitful.  I see it as no different from lying.  It would be different if he was withdrawing money from his own account, of course.  I'm sorry but I see red flags ahead for your marriage.  He sounds immature and self-centered.   He should have told his friends that he couldn't afford the expensive weekend, because he can't.", "To make this okay either he cancels, or YOU get to book a 3k trip for yourself and he doesn't get to say shit about it. \n\nNta", "I am going to Europe over Christmas and my 2 week trip is going to cost less than 3k including the peak time flight.", "It really does, I sent my husband overseas to see his mum for a week and it cost a third of that, and it included accom and hire car", "It's a 4 day trip! That's $750/day! I make a lot more than minimum wage & I sure as heck don't spend that kind of money on a trip! This man is outrageous!", "Or if OP has medical complications and then can no longer work. If they live in the US they could easily end up in huge medical debt. The line between living a comfortable life and homelessness and bankruptcy is incredibly thin and so many people end up in a situation they never thought was possible.", "**Your family needs a second car.** \n\n**No trip.** Use the $3,000 towards the new family car.", "Getting a second car with that 3,000 is now important than a boys trip. \n\nArguing the 3,000 to help when you're off work recovering from childbirth is more important than the boys trip. \n\nThat trip is so far down on the list it should never have been a consideration. \n\nPay the friend for half the hotel room and cancel the rest.", "How the hell do you spend 3k on a 4 day vacation to Barbados. Can go to Europe and live it up for 19 days for 5-6k esp if splitting a room", "Sounds like he needs to get a second job then. That would have been my first suggestion regardless \u2014 he should not drain the family account right before you are going on maternity leave and have all these extra baby expenses. Let him ask his family for a loan so he can take a vacation and pay them back, not you.", "Are you sure he isn't footing the whole bill for everyone?  \n\nLet's hope he doesn't go on a boys trip every time a balance builds up in the joint account.", "Seriously. He should use that 3k to get a car so he has better opportunities.", "Spending that much on a vacation without me, particularly if we had never been on a big trip together.  It might not be intentional, but this is incredibly insensitive and irresponsible to their stated joint goals.", "My wife and I regularly travel internationally and have been privileged to do some really cool things, and we\u2019ve never spent $750 per day on a trip for the two of us, much less individually. A couple of years ago we did three weeks in Western Europe, and our total was less than $10k. (And we\u2019re old, so decent hotels rather than hostels.)\n\nSpending that much on a four day trip seems like something only rich people should do.", "Seriously, how fancy of a hotel are they staying at? Is he flying first class or something?  $3k is so much for a four day trip."]}
