Having a child and creating a home are crucial milestones, and it's natural to feel worried about the expenses and your future. It's not about being jealous, but rather about financial responsibility, which is significant when planning for your child and future together. Openly communicating your concerns and discussing this matter with your husband could help in finding a balanced solution that considers your family's needs while also valuing his time with his friends.

This is a good wake-up call.  $3000 on a trip when your wife is pregnant is an insane thing to do.  Print out a list of all the things you have to buy for the baby, all the hospital and doctors bills (assuming you're US based and therefore will have to spend a lot of money on this) and then a breakdown of your reduced earnings due to any maternity leave and rain it down on him like the wrath of god.  Also remind him as he thinks he should get to go on the trip it's only fair that he also needs to find the money out of his allowance to take you on a Babymoon and get a push present.", "$3000 for a four day trip for one sounds outrageously expensive. NTA", "YWNBTA, but realize that this should come across as a conversation, not a demand.\n\nSo at the core, communication is key, and he failed to do that. Spending that much money on an undoubtedly fun, but purely-for-him trip out of a shared account without making sure it was ok first is asshole behavior. \n\nI am not sure I would phrase it as \"I want you to cancel the trip\" - you don't seem to have any problem with the trip itself - but make sure it's \"I'm a bit upset that you were planning to do this without discussing it with me\" and \"I need you to have a plan in place to make sure you 'pay back' the joint account before we need it for (baby/house/whatever) - otherwise there will not be a shared account at all.\"", "NTA for being frustrated.  He ought have discussed it with you. \n\nBut is there no compromise here?  Maybe he takes half out of the joint account, and half out of his account?  You post reads as though you really consider you shared account to be YOUR account because you earn more. And as though he isn\u2019t untitled to occasionally spend money on something he will really enjoy. \n\nI\u2019d urge you to use this as a clarifying moment. Don\u2019t demand that he cancel - as you point out, he won\u2019t be able to do this again for some time, and I think yes, YWBTA.  It reads like asking him to cancel would be an ask born from frustration, and that\u2019s never the path of wisdom. But maybe jointly make a decision about a level at which purchases from your joint assets need to be discussed?", "Here is how I would approach: IF it is actually going to take a large chunk out of finances, yes you should ask him to cancel the trip. You didn't know where the money was coming from, and the money in that account belongs to BOTH of you- therefore, it shouldn't be spent, especially in large amounts, unless you both agree.   \n\n\nIf it really isn't a HUGE deal for the money to be spent, I would let him go, but I would have a stern conversation about him needing to put that money back ASAP (maybe contributing a larger amount every paycheck to the account) and that going forward, there needs to be a discussion prior to the money being spent on something because you are married and you share that money.", "YWNBTA\n\nLook. As others said this should be a conversation.\n\nIt's the holiday season - can he pick up some seasonal work that would cover much if not all the cost?\n\nBc yeah. $3000 is 100 weeks of his FUN money. So... two years worth. And that is fair - he can make that choice - but you really need to be clear that, given baby and minimum wage - this isn't a small amount he can just help himself to.\n\nAlternately, you agree that - short of actively giving birth - he gets to go to the wedding in April by himself. You have plenty of time to figure out a few days of support for yourself so that he can be there for that.", "YWNBTA\nI\u2019d have the conversation with him now, while he still has plenty of time to save up his 30 per week towards this trip.", "YWNBTA. Believe me. Even after you give birth, he will still have a chance to meet and hangout with his friends. It is best to save the money for your delivery and child", "YWNTA", "YWNBTA\u2026 $3k for a trip without my wife would be the end times. He could I suppose pay back, but that\u2019s 2 years of no \u201callowance\u201d", "YTA for having a baby with someone that is not on the same level or page as you. You chose to marry someone that doesn\u2019t make money. Either dump him or accept that this is they way it will always be. And kiss that house good bye on minimum wage.", "I don't think YTA. With a baby on the way you do have to decide where money goes. Rather than outright telling him he can't go, can you put to him the reasons you are worried about spending so much money on a vacation at the moment? Maybe he just didn't consider the money as he was excited to be with his friends.", "NTA, tell him to cancel! That's just not fair.", "NTA\n\nA discussion is needed for sure.  I don't know if you need to jump right to \"cancel the trip\" - maybe if it's a priority and paying it back over time is feasible, it can be allowed.  But this is not the kind of thing you decide on without your partner.  He should have come to you and said \"I think I'm going to need to use some joint money for this trip, can we talk about it?\"  And that's a respect thing.\n\nMaybe it wasn't intentional.  Maybe he thought that you having been supportive about the trip meant that he thought you were okay with this.  \n\nI hope you don't need to say \"cancel the trip\" as the way to start that discussion.  But cancelling the trip ABSOLUTELY should be one possible outcome of the discussion.  It has to be on the table, until you agree to something else.", "NTA\n\nHe's taking the piss.", "NTA. 3K is a lot of money (a ton for a 4 day trip) and a large expense to be taking out of your joint account (also how is he ok with spending that much money on a boys trip for himself but not more on your wedding/honeymoon?) but It definitely warrants a conversation - how much does he have in his personal account he can contribute? If he\u2019s planning to \u201cpay it back\u201d overtime, what\u2019s his plan and do you think he\u2019d actually stick to it? It sounds like it wouldn\u2019t be a good financial choice especially before a baby and you\u2019re the breadwinner if you\u2019re going on maternity leave for a significant period of time as you\u2019d likely take a decent financial hit there. Have an open and honest talk with your husband about it! Are his friends more well off and maybe he\u2019s embarrassed and doesn\u2019t want to suggest a more cost friendly place? Do you guys have travel points he could use for the flight? Just make sure you keep an eye out for any red flags like if he tries to totally shut you down and say it\u2019s not up for discussion etc.", "NTA\nHe can't spend the joint money on a Holiday for himself. There's no compromise here,  he needs to use his own money.", "[removed]", "NTA. It would be another thing entirely if he saved up his own money for this trip, but it's completely unreasonable for him to decide to take $3000 from your joint account without actually have a conversation about this with you first. That should have been the very first conversation that you had about the possibility of this trip. If this trip was that important to him, he should have saved up for it and he should have asked you if he needed to borrow joint money to cover the rest. His disappointment is not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nI say let him go but he needs to pick up a 2nd job today. Retailers are hiring temporary seasonal workers.  This is how he can finance the trip (or reimburse you).", "So, he's planning to not spend a single dollar of the 30 a week that he gets, for 100 weeks straight, in order to pay this back, right?\n\nThat's where I would start with it OP. Does he not understand this is 2 YEARS worth of the fun allowance money that you guys set aside each week? Even if he only spends half, then what, for the next 4 years he's going to never spend more than 15 a week?\n\nTo me, if he has a legit plan to pay it back in a more timely fashion (maybe picking up a 2nd job for a few months or whatever) then probably ok, and I would say you should try and let him go, friends are important. If his plan is to pay you back over the next 5 years or so, 20 to 30 dollars a week, then hard no, if you need to save that long for a trip, it should be for the family.", "NTA.  If my husband decided unilaterally that he was going to spend thousands of dollars of our money on a solo trip, he would possibly come back to a separation.  That is so out of line.", "Before going anywhere you must have money. He has not saved up for the trip therefore it\u2019s a no go.", "NTA. I think you should reconsider how your finances are split!", "YWNBTA. He's planning to pay back $3k? Before the baby? Committing to this trip without talking to you about getting the money from the joint account is a problem. What if you or the baby have a complication and you need additional time off work? \n\nI'm so pissed off for you right now. He needs to get a second job to finance his trip. This is so irresponsible of him.", "NTA. He is not living within his/your means. Earning minimum wage, having a 10 person wedding and a $300 honeymoon kind of lifestyle does not support $3k vacations. And at this point there is no \u201chis money\u201d or \u201cjoint money\u201d when you\u2019re earning the majority of it and you have a kid on the way - every penny he makes needs to go toward the joint money for your family expenses. I\u2019m not even going into the obviously parts of him not even consulting you and making an executive decision, which would be bad either way but even more so when you\u2019re the primary breadwinner.", "NTA but there has to be a better solution- does he have $3,000? How is he planning on paying it back to the account? At $30 a month payback would be over 100 months,will he be picking up extra hours?Did he not discuss it because he knew you'd be upset? I think if he can come up with a workable payment plan that everyone is on board with fine, but otherwise it sucks to be an adult sometimes.", "NTA. If he wants fun money he needs to go get a second job. He also needs to get a better vocation and make more money. Whether he goes back to school or goes to trade school something in order to make it more than minimum wage. For years I worked more than one job, my second job I use for the family as our fun money.\n\nOh I guarantee he's going to try and go to that wedding just without you.", "Sounds like the two of you need to talk about this.", "I appreciate the tip, but the hospital is about half an hour away, while the bowling alley is across the street. We only have one car, and he walks to work.", "Some of them have already spent the money they can't get back on flights, tours, hotels, etc. Sean has not because he's splitting a hotel room with a friend who booked it, etc. It's that he needs to pay back his friends.", "I really doubt that he will pay it back", "Seriously. With a baby coming, he should really be trying trajectory towards a better paying job.", "This. My mom and I go to an all-inclusive in Punta Cana semi-regularly. We went last minute in October, and it was still only $3600 for BOTH of us, including a direct charter flight from our home city, for an entire week.

This sounds ridiculously expensive, even if this guy did have the money.", ">but realize that this should come across as a conversation, not a demand\n\nWhy should she coddle him like this?

Working in walking distance *does* make sense then.", "Maybe SO can get a second job or side hustle to earn the money. I would not be happy with that much money being spent on a 4 day vacation. What jobs do SO hold, maybe SO should ask for recommendations.  I\u2019d only agree if he earned money before the trip, at $30 a week look how long it will take SO to repay money.
