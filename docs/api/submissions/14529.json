I started seeing my boyfriend Adam (30M) in 2021, he moved to my place around the end of 2021.\n\nAt first Adam was shocked by how I let my cat be the dictator of my life. Then he bought her toys, played with her. He eventually disciplined/trained her to not wake us up at night (I finally had a full night's sleep after more than 2 years of being interrupted at least once during the night - it was my fault tho, I let her interrupt me).\nAll I want to say with this is that he tried, he put in the effort to like her. But he just doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut it turns out he just isn't the type to tolerate living with an animal. I wouldn't consider Luna to be a bad cat but accidents do happen, like sometimes there's a little pee in front of the litter box, sometimes she jumps on things she shouldn't, she leaves hair everywhere. But Adam tolerates it less and less, it frustrated him beyond comprehension (he says the cat is dirty and stinky - she's not but that's how he feels about her).\n\nSometimes Luna does something a little inappropriate (let\u2019s say sleeps on the couch when we\u2019re not home) he gets so irrationally angry for the situation, that I feel like he\u2019s going to have a heart attack. He said that it\u2019s because living with a cat wrecks his nervous system, he knows he\u2019s overreacting but can\u2019t help it. \n\nWe had a few discussions about it in the past. I expressed how I wouldn\u2019t have the heart to give up on my cat because she\u2019s like family to me. He said that he doesn\u2019t want to make me choose between them and he can imagine how hard this might be for me, but I have to understand that he\u2019s simply unable to tolerate Luna.\nI\u2019d like to add that other than his tolerance to Luna, he\u2019s a very great guy, the best I\u2019ve ever had by far. Loving, truly supporting, funny, we have good chemistry, we like each other\u2019s families, we more or less share the same belief system. So everything is so good about him, except his attitude for Luna.\n\nBut\u2026 last week Luna did something (mundane) that was the last straw for Adam, he said that either he goes or the cat goes. I asked him about it later, he said that he simply cannot handle this anymore, so he didn\u2019t just say it in the heat of the moment.\n\nI\u2019m very heartbroken right now, but I lean towards the cat going other than Adam going.\nWould I be the asshole if I gave Luna away? Hopefully to my parents (they love Luna to the moon and back) but if they can\u2019t take care of her in the long run (due to circumstances), then I would try to find her a loving home. Because I do feel like an asshole and an irrisponsible cat mom who shouldn\u2019t have had a cat in the first place. :(", "created_utc": 1681205252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ieaiw/wibta_if_i_gave_my_cat_away_in_favour_of_my/", "score": 1804, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Adam is the problem here, not Luna. Luna is being a cat, and honestly she sounds like a really good cat. Adam is being a control freak, and it\u2019s likely that when Luna goes, he will find a new \u201ccause\u201d for his appalling behaviour: you. \n\nI read in one of your comments that you\u2019re thinking of having kids with this man, and he says he won\u2019t freak out at kid stuff because *kids grow out of their \u201cdirty phase\u201d, while cats stay dirty their whole lives*\u2026yeah, that\u2019s not true. Cats can live 15\u201320 years, and sometimes longer, and they are very clean animals. Yes, they shed, and sometimes they have hairballs, and sometimes they get sick, and they expel waste like any other animal, but they are a tiny predator: it is in their best interest, behaviourally speaking, to leave as little impact on their environment as possible. A child\u2019s dirty phase starts from birth \u2014 or even before they are born if you are unfortunate enough to have morning sickness \u2014 and continues until they\u2019re old enough to not cause a mess, or until they\u2019re no longer living with you. If Adam can\u2019t handle just over a year of living with a cat, he is *not* going to be able to handle living with a messy infant, toddler, child, or teenager for up to 18 years.\n\nYou said that Adam also has an issue with Luna using a litterbox and *then walk[ing] all over her own shit*. Yeah, cats use a litterbox, but they actively try to avoid stepping in their own waste, and they clean up after themselves: if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s because they\u2019re stressed or sick. A kid will make a mess no matter their mood or level of health. Also\u2026what on earth does he think a toilet is, if not a human litterbox? You may remember, at the beginning of the pandemic it came out that a lot of people \u2014 and the vast majority of men \u2014 don\u2019t wash their hands after using the toilet. Adam is more likely to be spreading human waste around the house than Luna is to be spreading cat waste. As long as you keep the litterbox clean, which you say you do, Luna is not going to be spreading anymore waste around the place than you or Adam.\n\nYWBTA, OP, but you don\u2019t have to be. Keep Luna. Ditch Adam.", "YTA.\n\nHe \"trained\" a cat? And the leaving pee in front of the litter box is a sure sign Luna is pissed and/or stressed.

I know it's unpopular, but pets are not people and thus do not have the same priority as people.  They're pets.  Sometimes in life pur living situation changes such that we are no longer able to fit or keep a pet in our lives.  There's nothing wrong with choosing a partner over a pet if that's what it comes down to.\n\nThat said, I'm not going to try to psychoanalyze the handful of things you told us about your partner to come up with some prognosis that he's controlling or abusive like so many people here do.  Honestly the number people on this forum who think they can analyze a handful of statements from one person and read deeper into a relationship is troubling and I'm pretty sure redditors have probably ruined more relationships than they've helped.  You know your partner and your relationship better than any redditor trying to draw conclusions from a handul of anecdotes.  If this is otherwise a good man who you see yourself wanting to spend your life with and his only deal breaker is that he does not like your cat, you're allowed to choose him over a pet.", "NAH: your boyfriend tried and he can't tolerate your cat. Your cat can't help being a cat and will do what cats are wont to do. And of course, you're now in the spot of having to make a choice between them. You are trying to make the ethical decision of rehoming your cat to someone who will appreciate and care for the animal. But as others note, your pet has, probably, grown attached to you. This is a very difficult decision and I don't see it as an easy one to make. I guess that the best way to decide is to ask yourself: in five or ten years, which would you feel worse about having given up?", "NTA. This is a pure value decision.", "NTA. Not everyone likes living with animals. Adam clearly tried. As long as you find Luna a good home she will be fine. However, before you give her up a conversation with Adam about your future maybe in order. The last thing you want is to give up Luna and then realize Adam is about to move on. The fact that he is giving you an ultimatum rather than discussing the issue with you is quite concerning.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I started seeing my boyfriend Adam (30M) in 2021, he moved to my place around the end of 2021.\n\nAt first Adam was shocked by how I let my cat be the dictator of my life. Then he bought her toys, played with her. He eventually disciplined/trained her to not wake us up at night (I finally had a full night's sleep after more than 2 years of being interrupted at least once during the night - it was my fault tho, I let her interrupt me).\nAll I want to say with this is that he tried, he put in the effort to like her. But he just doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut it turns out he just isn't the type to tolerate living with an animal. I wouldn't consider Luna to be a bad cat but accidents do happen, like sometimes there's a little pee in front of the litter box, sometimes she jumps on things she shouldn't, she leaves hair everywhere. But Adam tolerates it less and less, it frustrated him beyond comprehension (he says the cat is dirty and stinky - she's not but that's how he feels about her).\n\nSometimes Luna does something a little inappropriate (let\u2019s say sleeps on the couch when we\u2019re not home) he gets so irrationally angry for the situation, that I feel like he\u2019s going to have a heart attack. He said that it\u2019s because living with a cat wrecks his nervous system, he knows he\u2019s overreacting but can\u2019t help it. \n\nWe had a few discussions about it in the past. I expressed how I wouldn\u2019t have the heart to give up on my cat because she\u2019s like family to me. He said that he doesn\u2019t want to make me choose between them and he can imagine how hard this might be for me, but I have to understand that he\u2019s simply unable to tolerate Luna.\nI\u2019d like to add that other than his tolerance to Luna, he\u2019s a very great guy, the best I\u2019ve ever had by far. Loving, truly supporting, funny, we have good chemistry, we like each other\u2019s families, we more or less share the same belief system. So everything is so good about him, except his attitude for Luna.\n\nBut\u2026 last week Luna did something (mundane) that was the last straw for Adam, he said that either he goes or the cat goes. I asked him about it later, he said that he simply cannot handle this anymore, so he didn\u2019t just say it in the heat of the moment.\n\nI\u2019m very heartbroken right now, but I lean towards the cat going other than Adam going.\nWould I be the asshole if I gave Luna away? Hopefully to my parents (they love Luna to the moon and back) but if they can\u2019t take care of her in the long run (due to circumstances), then I would try to find her a loving home. Because I do feel like an asshole and an irrisponsible cat mom who shouldn\u2019t have had a cat in the first place. :(\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even if they do learn to get out of the \"dirty phase\" they get into the \"rebellious phase\" the terrible twos, the middle school preteen who doesn't want to listen, the teenager who wants privacy from parents.

I DO agree with everyone saying \"imagine how he's gonna be if he wants kids.\" It sounds like ANYONE in that house will suffer under him if they don't put their shoes away in the right place, or spill a little juice on the carpet. It's one thing if the cat was outright attacking him or developed a bad habit of destroying furniture.

This sucks because I am totally a cat guy and my fiance she loves cats, but I just can't live with them due to my allergy to them and my asthma.\n\nBut he just doesn't like the cat. It could honestly be jealousy because he sees your affection for the cat and he wants to be the only thing in which you find affection. Animals are gonna do whatever they want. They're instinctual creatures. Sure, you can train a pet, but you can't 100% train a pet. As others have said, of you 2 have kids, it will be Luna all over again.\n\nI advise you to table the discussion for a bit. But keep a close eye on him and the way he treats you.

She\u2019s all alone in the house (you don\u2019t mention roommates or other cats) and wants to sleep somewhere that smells like you, and this is likely because she associates you/your smell with feeling safe. \n\nCats are often seen as these solo, incredibly aloof creatures, but in the wild they tend to have community groups because (since they aren\u2019t apex predators) it\u2019s much safer to have someone watching your back when you\u2019re vulnerable.\n\nOP. *He\u2019s getting mad at a cat for being a cat.* Not just annoyed, but *so angry you think he might have a heart attack.* And as others have pointed out, this is a big potential red flag\u2014 a lot of abusers hate cats because unlike dogs, cats tend to do what they want to do and not what the abuser wants them to do, denying the abuser the control they so desperately desire over everything around them.

First he's gonna find fault with your friends, family etc as he starts finding more fault with you.

He gaslit me, love-bombed me. He was clever enough to only leave bruises where people wouldn\u2019t see. Or he\u2019d \u201caccidentally\u201d leave a bruise somewhere it got seen and then blame it on the fact I did martial arts with him, and you could be left with bruises after being thrown around like a rag doll in the dojo. \nI tried to take my own life because I knew one day he\u2019d kill me. So in my mind at that moment, it was die at his hand or my own. \nWhy am I telling you, a perfect stranger, all of this? Because I don\u2019t want you to fall victim to some predator, who is finally showing his true colours now. Trust me, it took only 9 months of dating for my ex to show me who he was and I wish like hell that I had left the first time I called the police. But I didn\u2019t. I let his crocodile tears fool me into thinking he didn\u2019t mean to throttle me until I couldn\u2019t breathe. \n\nHopefully your boyfriend isn\u2019t like my ex. Who knows, maybe I\u2019m just projecting. But I honestly doubt that I am. I honestly think you need to think long and hard before packing his bags and changing the locks. You deserve better.\n\nGood luck sweetie xo", "YTA but listen hun, you need to get out of this relationship asap. For starters no one gets this tore up over a cat doing the least harmful of cat things, he\u2019s more than likely using Luna as an outlet for his anger.

If you were to listen to him and get rid of Luna and keep Adam that\u2019s going to lead to a lot of problems, he\u2018ll use you as his knee outlet for anger and in his mind seeing how you listened to him about giving away Luna he\u2019ll think you won\u2019t stand up and defend yourself. He\u2019ll think he can get away with it and then manipulate you into believing you were wrong or that you deserved. \n\nI read the comment of you saying he wants kids and because the child would be half of him he\u2019d have a higher tolerance but that isn\u2019t true. He more than likely won\u2019t have the patience and tolerance to deal with a kid, especially a toddler, despite what you think or he has told you. OP he\u2019s trying to manipulate you into giving Luna away and if you go through with it I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll open a door to even worse behavior on his end. \n\nI know it sounds like I\u2019m reaching here and maybe I am but he reminds me so much of how my dad was and how he treated me and my mom growing up that I don\u2019t want to see you get stuck in the same situation we were.

If you're considering a future with him and want kids, I'd really reconsider. They might not shed but they do puke, pee and can even poop on you or other things. Especially when newborn, they don't know how to hold it during a diaper change, I've been peed on multiple times by my son when he was a baby. They also wake you up a lot more then once a night. Also, some of them have callick (pretty certain I spelled that wrong) and they just about never stop crying, and can last for months. My first baby, she had it and the first 6 months were so hard.

I had 3 small dogs when we met. One has severe separation anxiety and we had him in the crate near us for a short time when (then boyfriend) came to my house. He was making all sorts of racket. We got them used to each other so the dog could be free to roam. Another dog was afraid of men and it took several trips to get her to be kind to him. He thought it was weird that the dogs slept on the bed, but he got over it and learned how to interact with the animals. He is the reason we got another dog and he is just as much of a dog person as I am now. He helps to train them with positive reinforcement. This is the kind of guy that would be a good fit for you. Someone that understands the things that you love and supports you in them.\n\nYWBTA both to yourself and to your cat if you got rid of the cat instead of the boyfriend. \n\nI'm sorry your previous experience with men has been so bad that this guy seems good.

You really should just ask yourself if you prioritize a future relationship with the cat, or your bf.

I made it extremely clear that this would not happen. One of them I had had since I was 12 years old. She was a cranky tortie just trying to live out her retirement. The other was a lovable, sweet little doofus. We were extremely bonded. Not long after, he started to become an awful husband, coming home late, being disrespectful. It was clear that I didn\u2019t have a cat problem, I had a husband problem. They were the catalyst (ha) that helped break up our marriage, and I will forever be grateful. I moved into one of the spare bedrooms and eventually got out of that hell. Once I moved rooms, cranky tortie started peeing on his clothes out of spite. Kitties and I eventually found a wonderful man and they lived out the rest of their lives happily (not peeing on new guy\u2019s clothes, might I add).

It has always baffled me why this has happened to me so many times too--idk if it is a rural/country thing or what.

Even if he is not currently physically harming her, cats are very sensitive and are fearful of displays of anger. They are social creatures who form strong bonds with their human companions and like to be close in proximity to they people they love best.
