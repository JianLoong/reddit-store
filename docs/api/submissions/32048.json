And some pair really well into cocktails and etc. There are a few rules though, if you are drinking someone elses bottle (if you are slightly newer/are not old drinking buddies with them) you drink it in a similar fashion to the person who owns the bottle but that I think is just old fashioned drinking etiquette. But at the end of the day if the only reason the person is drinking is to get drunk then the quality of the drink does not matter (to an extent there are some alcohols I would not serve to literally anyone) and the only reason why they want to drink it is because it looks fancy.
