But seeing as your BF didn't drop Mitch even after this behavior, I'd say there is a very real possibility that he values Mitch more than you, maybe not in a romantic sense, but in emotional.", "NTA. Mitch is the AH for his treatment of you and your relationship, so you're in the right for setting boundaries. Unless Mitch apologizes and follows through on changed behavior you don't have to include him in your life.", "NTA your party your rules", "NTA. Has Mitch even apologized to you?", "NTA. Because you told him not to say anything. It's in the past not forgotten or forgiven. I'd have a hard time inviting him.", "Unless Mitch has apologised and grown up, then he shouldn't be showing up after basically calling you a shitty person. NTA. I would explain that it's not because you feel threatened by Mtich's love for your boyfriend or anything though, because at the moment he may think that is the reason you don't want him around.", "NTA But... You didn't want to deal with this when it happened (no drama). So you explicitly pretended everything was OK although it was not. Now you want to rehash the past (drama) making your bf feel awkward with Mitch (which will be the result). You should have confronted the issue when it happened so that it had an opportunity to resolve. I sugggest if Mitch is important to your Bf that you act like adults and address the situation and hopefully move on.", "Info: you said your source (who told you about Mitch talking behind your back) is an ex best friend. How reliable are they? Is it not possible that they might have tried to start drama between you and your boyfriend using Mitch as a wedge? Specially if you are not friends anymore...", "NTA - why would you want to invite someone who talks shit about you behind your back to your party?", "NTA, I wouldn't invite ANYONE who has/previously had feelings for my BF regardless of whether it's a gay guy or a straight girl. Your BF NEEDS to respect that you're uncomfortable with Mitch. Eventually, this will boil over to a \"It's either him or you\" situation, and honestly, depending on how he acts around Mitch, now he may end up choosing Mitch.", "Bingo.  People are hung up on Mitch's crush, but the real issue is that he was disrespecting OP and her relationship with the bf.", "He has distanced himself from Mitch. I really wanted to confront him but it is a really long story and it will cause a bunch of problems to a bunch of people. If that\u2019s not the case, I would most definitely kill him >< plus they have been best friends for more than 11 years I kinda feel bad because it is his best friend.", "He is straight", "sorry i did not mention it, but i verified with his close friends whom he told them about. +my ex bsf texts with him talking about how he think my bf deserves better etc.", "It\u2019s a long story, but It is true. Verified by several people that Mitch told them about.", "I wish it was that easy. The thing I don\u2019t want the most is drama.. i did not want to confront Mitch because i know how damaging it would be towards his friendships. It\u2019s a long story, I just felt like it isn\u2019t his fault that he has feelings for my boyfriend and maybe he is taking out his sadness/anger by talking bad about me. idk \ud83d\ude2d i don\u2019t want drama but i just don\u2019t want him in my party but then again it\u2019s my boyfriends best friend so i understand slightly but i still DONT KNOW", "Hi, i\u2019ve seen the texts between my friend and Mitch personally, and also have been warned by Mitches close friends.", "So your EX - bestfriend told you Mitch talks shit? I think you need to confront Mitch before making a decision, you can't go on hearsay.", "Don't feel bad, Mitch is an awful person for saying things about his best friend's partner, that's just a shitty thing to do, doesn't matter how long they've known each other or whether he's in love with him or not. No best friend does something like that.", "thank you. NTA then.", "Then NTA for not wanting him at your event. But it is something that you'll have to discuss with your boyfriend since, apparently he doesn't feel the same way. \n\nGiven his reaction, I assume next time, when it is his time to host, Mitch will probably be invited. And you have to decide if you are ok with that or where your boundaries lie.", "it\u2019s a long story as i said, but ive seen between the messages with him and my friend in person. and i can\u2019t confront him, because as i said i don\u2019t want to cause any drama as i am not friends with my best friends anymore.", "Messages are easy to fake. Ridiculously easy. You need to figure out another way.", "Long story short, went through my best friends messages without her knowing. Found out about stuff and that\u2019s why we are not friends anymore. That\u2019s also how I found out Mitch is in love w my bf, and is talking shit about our rs with my ex bsf."]}
