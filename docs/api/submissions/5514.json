Because its something that shows appreciation.\n\nAre my kids going to like the teams I hate because someone gave them a gift ?\n\nNo. They'll probably root for the teams that I root for, and if not, so what.\n\nMy daughter came with me to a game. Players on the other team (Sharks) actually gave her pucks and interacted with her (we sat on the glass, and they would smile at her, knock on the glass, etc). \n\nTime of her life (and she felt bad when the sharks lost, I didn't, lol), but she isn't a fan of the sharks now either.

I hated every single one.  I accepted them and let their well-earned passive-aggressive money sit in the back of a drawer until they got boxed up and donated with the rest of his outgrown clothing/toys.  Just because someone gets you a gift doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to use it, and if you are really *that* against one team (like I am against all of them) then you should have found a more tactful way of dealing with the situation.", "after reading your comments to people i don\u2019t really think the (extremely) clear judgement of YTA will have an effect on you. comparing being a fan of a hockey team to being vegan is absolutely nuts. one is a (perhaps very strong) preference, and one is a lifestyle choice. i get being annoyed and maybe even a bit riled up at the gift, but there was no need to be rude about it. making a joke about how it probably wouldn\u2019t get much use or may go missing would have made your feelings clear in a respectful manner. i understand where you\u2019re coming from, but respectfully, it\u2019s really just not that deep", "YTA  You're the Masshole.

Good grief, grow up", "Quite the opposite, having it in baby photos would be cute and show everyone you're a good sport and not too close minded.\n\nSee, I feel quite passionately about a certain car brand (not to the point it dominates my whole life though), and still I'd find it cute if someone gifted my baby a onsie of a certain other brand I .. don't like very much (because they make crap cars and everyone driving one is an idiot).

Try to be better", "Maybe if you could knit then you\u2019d be able to make your kid a sports jersey from a team you like.\n\nDon\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth, it was a sports jersey not a lifelong membership.

I would of graciously accepted the ugly jersey and said thank you for the gift. Then after I would sell it or give it to someone who is a fan. This is coming from a leafs fan.

Tbh you sound ignorant and bombastic.\n\nYour aunt was probably trying to do something thoughtful since she knows you like hockey. Just because it's likely not her thing and so she's not aware of the intense rivalry, doesn't mean you get to be rude to her. Just accept the jersey in the spirit in which it was given. If you don't want your son to wear it then don't put him in it. YTA.\n\nIdk why people obsessed with hockey seem to think everyone should care about it as much as they do.

Everyone pretty much disagrees with you......", ">but does anyone here see my point?\n\nNo. YTA.", "Info: do you have a moral dilemma with the Canadians?", "Yes, totally the same.

They would have thought it was funny, laughed, and probably taken a few satire photos with it on their kid.
