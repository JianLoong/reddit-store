I\u2019ve known since I\u2019ve met him that I want to marry him. At first I didn\u2019t want to marry anyone. It seemed like people would just do it for the title and there is nothing more to it.\n\nWell that changed much since I\u2019ve met this man. He\u2019s just great. He\u2019s caring, loving and funny. And even though we\u2019ve had many ups and down in which our relationship was tested. We are our own persons after all with different backgrounds and upbringing. We know we are compatible and want to share our lives together. We both have decided we would want to marry, but in the future. I\u2019m still a student and we both feel too young to get married. \n\nNow comes the tough part. I am a teacher and my students (11-15 years) call me by my last name. I feel very proud for what I have achieved and I want to show of with my own name. It is something in my life where I know I did so good and made it work. And it\u2019s probably one of the only things that feels like me. I also want to accomplish more in life. I don\u2019t know how yet, but I would like to research a certain part of education and publishing the results (in a book?) for other people to also learn from it.\n\nI told my boyfriend that I want to take his name legally, but also I would want to keep my own last name at the workplace. So I could be called miss van Dijk (not my real last name). I would even be okay with just being called miss van dijk, but be registered as mine and his name at work. So if his last name is Pollen (also not real) and my last name now is van Dijk. I want my name to be Pollen - van Dijk. But my name at work to remain (miss) van Dijk.\n\nWell he didn\u2019t take that well. He told me that there\u2019s no point in marrying me then. He doesn\u2019t even want to marry in the future if I want to keep my own last name at work. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s mad, annoyed or disappointed. But it really sucks.\n\nI\u2019m really torn, because it is something I have accomplished in my life and I want my name \u2018on it\u2019 as figure of speach. But I alsof really want to marry him in the future and take the next step in our relationship.\n\nI really don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong, but it really feels like it. I just need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable or as the asshole.\n\nWhere I could be the asshole? I don\u2019t want to take my boyfriends name in the workplace as a teacher.\n\nMy first language isn\u2019t English so I\u2019m sorry for any grammar mistakes and such.\n\nAITA for wanting to keep my own last name in the workplace after marriage?\n\nEdit: I have not read all the comments yet, so I will tonight and respond to (some of) them. I wanted to clear something up about marriage. We do not want to marry now or soon. We both want to grow up together, so it\u2019s a factor to discuss. I will be studying for 2 more years. And maybe 2 years extra for my masters degree. And I do not want to marry before I\u2019m done with my studies. He also agrees. So it\u2019s in the far future for us. At least 4 years.\n\nIt\u2019s not like he wants to break up. He just said he wouldn\u2019t marry me if that\u2019s what I wanted. I think it was an overreaction, because it is not what he expected in his future relationship and married. Still, an overreaction doesn\u2019t make this comment okay, I know that. \n\nNext to that, I\u2019ve asked him if we could talk someday soon about this topic. He said yes. I will read all comments before that so I can get an objective view, but also more views about this topic. \n\nThanks for all the reactions!", "created_utc": 1692523116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15w6out/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_my_own_last_name_at_the/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is a very territorial statement and shows that h feeding his own ego is far more important to him than supporting you or accepting and understanding your feelings.\n\nThe marriage is unlikely to be happy for you if that\u2019s the attitude he takes into it, so be very clear in your mind about whether you find that acceptable before you commit to this person, and if you don\u2019t want that, hold off on the wedding until he has had the opportunity to work on that aspect of himself and you feel confident that he will listen to and respect you.", "NTA. But be very, very careful - if he thinks the only reason to get married is to slap his name on you, then he thinks of marriage as a way to make you his property, not his lifelong partner.", "Info: what does he think marriage is, truly", "NTA.\n\nThe last name you choose to use is your business not his.\n\nThat he\u2019s making such a big deal about a nothing issue is very concerning about how he\u2019d behave regarding an actual thing you\u2019ll need to compromise on. Like, say, how to raise children", "NTA Where I am from women don't take the name of their husband. Anyway, most people marry each other because it's symbolic, keeping names or not.", "NTA\n\nI did this exact thing. I had worked at a workplace for 10 years before I got married, so for ease of everything, I used my maiden name at work and married name everywhere else. It's been 7 years since I got married, and I'm still at that same workplace with my maiden name. \n\nMy husband didn't care. He didn't care if I changed my name anyway but in this instance it didn't affect him or my name not matching future children as it was only one place where my name was different and not like on passports or school. \n\nIt is your name, you are not under any obligation to change it in the first place. Marriage is a partnership, not one person claiming ownership over the other", "NTA but PLEASE reconsider this relationship. Those are the words of a man who sees you as potential property, not a partner", "NTA\n\nI married my now husband few weeks ago and this same question what popped.\n\nI work in a field and a kind of job where there's a lot of network, some going as far back as college meetings. I've been working for 12 years now, all in my maiden name. I'm well known in my field of work with this name. To change my name now can hurt my career and push me back. In my everyday life, I started to put everything in my married name, as a way to keep work and private lives separate.\n\nI explained it to my husband and he fully agrees with my choice. Even if he doesn't agree with it, it's my choice, and he has to respect it. My last name will not be the absolute root of who I am.\n\nWhy changing everything in life from maiden name to married name is an expectation ? The name changing is only one possibility coming with marriage, and nowadays not mandatory. The way he reacts made me think of the married name like a property stamp.", "NTA. If he\u2019s actually reconsidering marrying you over some outdated patriarchal BS, then he\u2019s not the one for you.", "NTA. Am a teacher, plenty of women at work who are married use their maiden names. No stress to us or the students.", "NTA - I will say every single time. \nI find changing name after marriage something a stupid tradition that must come to an end.\nIt\u2019s what is leftover of an actual patriarchal society were women were literally considered property and marriage alike a commercial transaction.\nDon\u2019t change your name! You are who you are and marriage shall not change that!", "NTA. Suggest he take YOUR last name if he's that interested in matching names. And dont marry someone who appears to only want to do so if they can prove possession of you", "NTA. I always feel sad for people in their early 20s who talk about their relationships having \u2018ups and downs\u2019 and being \u2018tested\u2019. Honestly, there\u2019s better out there for you. You\u2019re under absolutely no obligation to take his name. I didn\u2019t for similar reasons to your own - I built who I am with this name, it\u2019s mine. And I\u2019d be very wary of someone who doesn\u2019t accept that. Walk away, you\u2019ve got so much more to offer.", "NTA, but I think you have to have a frank discussion about your values. Some people wait until they're married to show their true colors and it might be you've just seen a glimpse of them. Is he one of those alpha-males who think they own a woman and she's to stay home and pop out kids? Does he respect you and your opinions at all? This is about more than just a name and there's an underlying issue that must be resolved first.", "Yikes, this is a major red flag.  He seriously only sees the point of marrying you if you take his last name at work?  This sounds like some serious ownership issues from him.  I'm an attorney and I kept my maiden name at work because it's the name I've been using and am known for in the legal community for the past 16 years.  Taking my husband's last name at work would eliminate all the name recognition I've been building up for nearly 2 decades.  My husband understands this and completely supports me.  OP, you should keep your maiden name for work as you're proud of your accomplishments and a real man isn't going to be threatened by this.", "NTA at all and he is a misogynist.", "NTA\n\n>  He told me that there\u2019s no point in marrying me then. He doesn\u2019t even want to marry in the future if I want to keep my own last name at work\n\nYour BF is immature and naive and controlling if that is his response to you keeping your last name professionally.\n\nSo many women keep their last name when they marriage for professional and business reasons.  Its almost become the norm!", "NAH - For a marriage to work, two people must agree on it.\n\n\"He doesn\u2019t even want to marry in the future if I want to keep my own last name at work.\"\n\nIf that sacrifice is too much for you, tell him, and go about your separate ways.", "NAH.

How they call us is a big part of that. It sounds weird, but true. Maybe you should try to explain it this way to him.\n\nBut yeah, this is never a good sign. I had something similar happen in my friend group and it's a stingy topic. I think men should respect women's choices when it comes to changing their names and try to find some common ground.", "NTA. What I don\u2019t get is why the name is so important. Your accomplishments are yours regardless of what your name is. I also don\u2019t understand why the name is so important to him. I could care less if my spouse takes my last name or not, but I guess that is just me. \n\nCan you actually change your legal name, but register to work under your maiden name?  Or would you just be telling your students that your name is your maiden name. Using two names seems like a recipe for legal issues down the road.", "NTA - but I\u2019m confused about mechanics. If you legally change your name, how does that work by having your work name your maiden name? Your job would need to pay you and they would pay your legal name. Would they be OK with calling you Ms. Smith while your paychecks read Mrs. Jones? Usually if a woman wants to keep her names for professional purposes, they just don\u2019t change it legally. For instance my stepmom never changed her name when she married my dad, but for social purposes she goes by Mrs. (Dad\u2019s last name). My misogynistic father wisely figured out that my stepmom was a good catch and didn\u2019t insist that she legally change her name when they married.

You may have the will to keep it for different reasons (you like it, you want to keep some of your family legacy, ...etc.) and it is your and only your decision.\n\nMarriage is way more than just being called Miss.\"Spouse of this man\", and it is very very very egocentric and chauvinist, especially in 2023, to think it is pointless if you want to have both lastnames together, because you'll still carry his. And You didn't force him to carry yours.\n\nNTA\n\n\u00c9dit: I forgot the NTA", "I did not change my name, legally or professionally, and it has never been an issue. Guess what, I am still legally married. It\u2019s common these days to keep your name or to hyphenate it. Your bf is sexist. If it\u2019s that important to him, he can change his name.", "NTA... \nAT ALL!!!\n\nI've been married for nearly 8 years. I kept my name and made it known I would not change it under any circumstances. \n\nThe only people who were bothered were my parents who felt I \"should take the man's name\". \n\nNah. It's 2023. He's being a baby. Your name carries so much for you and keeping it doesn't mean you love him less or don't respect him.", "NTA. If the only reason he wants to marry you is to have you take on his name, please reconsider if marriage is the right way to go forward. \n\nGoing by your made up names I'm guessing you're Dutch? If so, you will always legally retain your own name. You can request that they use your married name to address you, but your passport will have your own birth name on it.\n\nI'm Dutch, married, took my husband's name, but professionally I'm known by my birth name. My husband doesn't care, as long as I am happy he is happy.", "NTA - I've had this conversation with my bf. I have several degrees in my current name, it's a very distinct surname that would stand out as I further my career so I'd like to at least keep it as my professional name. \n\nI would sit down and have a good long talk about why he is reacting this way, the underlying issue. Maybe you guys can overcome it", "NTA - But I would urge you to consider it from his perspective. I assume that most women in your culture change their surnames when they marry. The fact that you don't want to do that (or rather, want to do it half way) suggests that you're not as invested in the marriage as the average woman. I'm sure that isn't true, but I can see why he may think that.\n\nAlso, changing your surname doesn't in any way undermine your professional achievements. Neither your professional peers nor your students will think any different of you with a new surname. They know you as an individual, not as a name.", "NTA and his reaction should be taken as a warning.", "You're way too young to get married and I've read you already had several rough patches in your relationship. And now he reacts like this. Not very mature and it sounds like the two of you are not ready for marriage. Are you Dutch, the names in your example sounds dutch? I don't know any Dutch persons getting married this young.", "NTA\n\nBut maybe not marry someone who thinks of marriage as possessing you.", "NTA. And BTW, I took my husband\u2019s last name socially but professionally still use my last name. Even though my coworkers know I\u2019m married, they don\u2019t even know what his surname is. Everyone is fine. \n\nGenuinely I wonder if your ages have something to do with it. I was with my husband at 20 years old but couldn\u2019t imagine starting our married life then. We were quite literally different people. I like us much better now (in our 30s).", "NTA. I have a double last name for exactly the same reason. My husband couldn't have cared less what I chose. Because he's normal and he loves me.", "NTA\n\nConsider these points:\n\n- No, there is nothing normal about having lots of ups and downs in a relationship, especially not only 2 years in and at a young age. If it's already this dramatic, it doesn't look good for a happy future together. \n\n\n- Men who are so hung up on their wife taking their last name are usually not very into the concept of women having basic rights and autonomy. They usually believe men should be in charge and women should obey. They usually believe women should do most of the housework and serve their husbands. I can guarantee you this last name thing is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\n- Being attached to the idea that you'll eventually get married can lead you to tolerating more than you otherwise would and create barriers to leaving. You're not married, you're not going to be married any time soon, you don't have to stick around and try to resolve stupid conflict. You can just move on.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is right though, there is no point in getting married. It won't work if that's his attitude.", "Those women who want to change their name, have at it. But I think it's odd and I didn't want my wife to change hers.\n\nI can't imagine anything less important. The idea that marriage is pointless without it - wow, that is a bad sign.", "Apparently ownership and branding.", "Marriage is not about changing your name\u2026..if he wants the same name as her, why doesn\u2019t he change his last name to hers? taking your husbands name is a tradition but so were dowrys and women were deemed to be property and those traditions are gone. Sharing a surname is one thing but making the woman be the one who changes their name Or not get married is archaic.", "Why is OP the AH?", "I did not change my last name legally when we got married and prefer my last name. I primarily use that name but sometimes use my husband\u2019s last name socially and sometimes businesses or friends and family will assume that my legal name changed. It\u2019s been 10 years and I\u2019ve never had a legal issue or an issue with insurance or banking or cashing checks made out to my first name his last name. \n\nI also don\u2019t care if people remember Miss/Mrs and usually select Ms if I have to choose something on a form. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s misrepresenting myself as not married, I just don\u2019t find it important that women are expected to use an honorific that highlights whether they\u2019re married. I\u2019m comfortable with any of the three and my husband wouldn\u2019t care if children or anyone else were referring to me as Miss. \n\nIf I had decided to legally change my last name I would have kept using my last name professionally as OP is planning to do. This is common and understandable and not as complicated as you\u2019re making it out to be. She simply wouldn\u2019t change the name she uses at work even if the name on her legal/tax documents changed.", "I know people who legally changed their name but continued to use their previous name professionally and not only in cases of a name change due to marriage. It\u2019s not complicated. Their forms/tax/insurance info might change but they continue to use the same name and their email address and business cards don\u2019t change. \n\nAlso the reverse, some people might use a preferred name but haven\u2019t been able to make the legal change yet or might have a first name they don\u2019t like and use a middle name or nickname or totally unrelated name. HR and IT update the name in their system so everything uses the preferred name even if the legal/payroll stuff has the legal name. It\u2019s all common and uncomplicated.", "My sister uses both her pre-married and married names; she is Dr X in the workplace and Mrs Y at home.
