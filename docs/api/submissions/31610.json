My mom cried to my then bf and I that she didn't want to live alone and asked if we would move in with her. We said that there was no way we could move into my childhood bedroom due to being a couple and that the commute for our jobs would be too far but that if she wanted to sell her house and buy one with us, we could do that. So we did.\nShe put down the downpayment for the house and paid for some upgrades and we paid for other upgrades. We split the bills in thirds.\n3 years ago we had her stop paying bills at all so that she could save up to buy her own little home in a retirment community because our lives didn't mesh well and she finally wanted to be on her own. A year later she signed over the title of the house to us, we refinanced to take her off the mortgage, and she bought a new home for herself.\nNow, 2 years later, my husband and I are going to sell our home. We'll be moving almost all of the proceeds from selling the current house as the down payment for the new house in order to make it affordable for us. When my mom found out, she immediately wanted a percentage of the sale of the house.\nI see the house as my inheritance because I never asked for or received any kind of other monetary inheritance from my dad's death. She got his life insurance, his pension and his military retirement pay which will both continue until she dies. She's retired.\nI feel hurt and astonished that she feels entitled to money from this house and we said no, that we wouldnt be able to give her money. My husband and I aren't making any Profit off of selling the house at all. \nThis whole thing isn't surprising though as my mom has narcisstic tendencies.

She also paid her share of the bills while she lived with you. She should at least get back the downpayment and any money she paid towards upgrading the home. She didn't get to enjoy it. Why should you and your boyfriend benefit from a home she helped to pay for? If your mom is a narcissist, you have inherited that trait from her. You conned her into helping you buy a house, which you now feel fully entitled to because your dad didn't leave you an inheritance. P.S. Why should your boyfriend, who didn't contribute to buying the house, benefit from the sale, but your mom doesn't?", "Info: So you did pay back all the money she invested into buying the house or was there anything left?", "I'm confused, did you ever give back to your mum the down-payment she put down on your house. If not she is owed money.  Also why would you think you're entitled to an inheritance from your dad. Your mum is his next of kin so she's entitled to receive his estate not you and she may have even been the one that was responsible for building up the wealth that she and your dad had. When my dad died my mum rightly received everything he owned and what he owned was largely due to her as she was the one who moved around what little amount of money they managed to save to the accounts paying the best rate of interest.", "I am hurt and astonished that she feels entitled to money from this house. Did you buy her out or pay back that money? \n\n I never asked for or received any kind of other monetary inheritance from my fathers death. Why would you receive his military retirement? His pension? That goes to spouses, not children. Like legally he can\u2019t will his retirement to you, it goes to spouses. Why do you feel entitled to things that go to a spouse? Did your dad write a Will leaving you things and she stole them?", "YTA - even if the down payment she made was the minimum, that\u2019s still the majority of the principal paid for the first several years of the mortgage. Unless you specifically agreed that living rent free while looking for a new place was her repayment, you should have absolutely been transferring some share of the proceeds to her. To \u201cassume it was inheritance\u201d shows you\u2019re a selfish moron.", "YTA - she\u2019s not dead yet and she\u2019s still paying on the smaller place. That would have been your inheritance. She gave you the down payment and paid a third of the bills for a few years. It\u2019s pretty selfish not to give her a part of it.", "YTA\n\nFavorite thing: \n\n\u201cMy husband and I aren\u2019t making any profit off of selling the house at all.\u201d\n\nBut somehow\u2026\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be moving almost all of the proceeds from selling the current house as the down payment for the new house\u201d", "YTA - You expected an inheritance when your dad died? This is odd. Most wealth goes directly to his spouse; the one who contributed to building the wealth unless he had a will allocating money to you.\n\nWhen you refinanced the home you did not explain her original 1/3 down payment and increased value of this sum would not be provided to her?  Or in exchange for not providing this, she will live rent free to save up to secure your new home. Money needs to be discussed and agreements put in writing otherwise one party is sure to be upset.", "There\u2019s no inheritance aspect here.  What you need to calculate is\n\nher portion of the downpayment\n\n\\+ her upgrades\n\n\\+ any portion of the principal she paid off\n\n\\- market rent she saved by not paying for a year \n\nwhatever that total is, you need to pay her back.  If you made made a profit on the house, you need to give her a portion of that too.  thats how it works.\n\nShould she just \u201cgift\u201d you whatever she spent on the house?  Maybe, maybe not, but that\u2019s up to her not you.", "YTA, you sure did a great job at making yourself sound like the true narcissist and entitled person. Your mom is asking for what is rightfully her\u2019s. She should receive the portion you stated she put down at the very minimum. Her request does not sound unreasonable at all. However, the thought that you would even imply you deserved any inheritance is ridiculous.", "It's not clear from your post what your mother's financial stake in the house is, but whatever it is, she's entitled to it.  Your father's inheritance is irrelevant.  You have no entitlement to it as your father made his choice of where to direct his inheritance and that is the end of the matter.  So, stick to the matter of each person's equity in the house and divide accordingly.  YTA if you don't.", "YTA obv your dad didn\u2019t put you in the will", "YTA\n\nKids aren\u2019t entitled to any inheritance ever.  But in top of that Generally while a spouse is alive any money should go to them first as it\u2019s jointly held, that\u2019s the point of marriage assets.\n\nYou bought a house together, it wasn\u2019t a gift, she should have been appropriately bought out.", "YTA, for  thinking you're entitled to anything from your father. \n\nIs the amount she saved by not paying 1/3 of the mortgage the same as the down-payment and the part of the mortgage she did pay? And did you make a profit?", "This is really quite simple. When you sell the house your mother is owed the total of her downpayment and mortgage payments at minimum, plus 1/3 of capital gains that occurred before signing it over to you . Why should you get your money back out of the house when you sell but not her? Narcissistic tendencies you say? The apple doesn't fall far from the tree apparently. YTA.", "YTA.  \n\n\nFirst of all, you didn't get an inheritance. Get over it.  \nYou're not entitled to inherit anything, she is though, because she is his spouse.\n\n\nSecondly, you offered to let her buy into a house with you and she sells hers and puts down your down payment on the house.  \nYou aren't even giving her the down payment back?  \n\n> I feel hurt and astonished that she feels entitled to money from this house and we said no, that we wouldn't be able to give her money.\n\nYou sure as hell feel entitled to the money she gave you all those years ago tho, you profited off her by saving the down payment and money on the upgrades she did for you.\n\nYou should have discussed this before she signed the title of the house over too you.\nThe only entitlement here is yours.", "YTA. \n\nFirst off, you don't get an inheritance when one parent passes and the other survives them if they were still together. Everything \"he\" had was actually \"theirs\" and therefore went from being \"theirs\" to \"hers\".\n\nSecond, she put a bunch of her own money into this house in the form of the down payment, repairs, and a portion of the mortgage for several years. That is her money that she parked into this asset. You're lucky she didn't insist you buy out her share of the equity when she moved out and signed the deed over. She was being a nice parent then. Hell it was pretty damn nice of her to pay for the down payment as well as it sounds like you probably didn't have the money yourself. She got you into that house. And you dare to call her a narcissist???\n\nSo yes, she absolutely deserves to get the money back that she parked into this asset to help you. It is not your money. You sound entitled as hell.", "Don't blame her for your dad not leaving you anything. Everything you mentioned is for spouses. Life insurance he could have put you down as a beneficiary too but he didn't. I don't think your mom is entitled to anything from selling your house", "YTA. Unless when you refinanced you also paid her out.\n\n She sunk just as much money into this place as you did, plus the down-payment.  \n\nThe fairest way to divvy this up when you sell is to\n\n1) give your mom the down-payment she paid\n2) tally up the mortgage payments each of you made and figure out the percentages put in and split any equity based on that. \n\nYour father's will and the fact he didn't leave anything to you does not entitle you to take from your mom. Pensions and retirement funds are NOT inheritances. Nor is life insurance.", "YTA. pay your mom back for what she put into it. You aren't entitled to anything.", "YTA. The inheritance is when your mom is passed away. Till then she has the rights to your dad\u2019s money. \nShe paid for the down payment of your house. And  she didn\u2019t ask it back when you were living there(she should have when she left). Now she has every right to ask it.", "YTA. Inheritance happens AFTER she dies, not before.", "YTA.\n\nShe at the very least is owed the down payment and anything she invested in the house.  \n\nAs far as inheritance from your dad, I don't understand why you think you were entitled to anything.  Next of kin and the only entitled heir would be his spouse, your mom.  When your mom dies, only THEN do you come into the picture.", "Give her back what she put in. YTA", "YTA and narcissist", "YTA. She put money in and you never paid it back.\nAs well she should get a percentage of the increased value of the property at the time of sale. She's owed that. Also you don't get inheritance generally if your parents were still together and one is left living after the others death. She needs that money to live her retirement and you've now taken some of that fixed amount of money (assuming she's retired).", "YTA\n\nYour dad not leaving you an inheritance has zero to do with your mother. You talked your mom into selling her home and paying on one to live in with you. That was her money she put a down payment on and her money used for upgrades. When she signed over her part it was under the assumption you\u2019d keep the house, that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t sell you her share. If you know she put in money on the house and you wouldn\u2019t be getting a new home without her contribution, then pay her back her share. The only entitled person in this story is you.", "YTA - you don\u2019t get to just decide what your inheritance is, she put down on your house that you wouldn\u2019t have without her, you should be grateful! Pay her back what she is owed. You will get your inheritance when she dies.", "YTA. You should give her back the money she invested in that house. It wasn't fair that she just signed over her share to you without compensation.", "Yta", "She had an equity investment in the house you sold. Did you reimburse that investment? If not, YTA.", "Legally, she signed over the title to you. It is your house, and you are entitled to the profits. If there was a different agreement, that's another story.", "If your mom was still married to your dad when he died, then of course it all goes to your mom.  So I would just stop thinking about that.\n\nWith unstable people like your mom, going with the law is the only way to do it.  She isn't on the deed, therefore she doesn't own part of the house, therefore she doesn't get money from the sale.\n\nWhat's more, if you believe your mom got out of the house what she put into it by living \"free\" for three years, then you don't even have to feel any sort of way about not giving her a cut.  I'm sorry she isn't a reasonable person and is trying to just get what she can.  People can really suck sometimes.", "NTA yall did this together, and she benefits as well. Three 3years later she stops paying bills so she can save money to move out and yall refinance.  Seems like everyone benefited from that arrangement and the refinancing to remove her name made yall square.", "First time I have ever said OhMyGod out loud after reading an AITA post.   OF COURSE you owe your mother back for the money that she put into the house.   Why is that even a question?  You can't retroactively decide that you are keeping her down-payment as some kind of inheritance that you think you are owed, that's insane. She's no longer living with you, give it back when you sell the house.  That's your mom.  YTA for being so entitled.", "My guess is NTA. Legally you owe her nothing as she signed the house over. I guess it would depend as to how much she put down and towards initial repairs vs how much the cost to maintain the house was. If she put down $20k and her Perrin of house bills over the time she lived for free was close to $20k, I\u2019m fine. If she put down $100k and her portion of living expenses was like $10k, then I may have an issue. \n\nMy guess if everyone says you\u2019re the asshole because you feel entitled to her money as an inheritance or something else from your dad dying. You\u2019re not entitled to any of that. That makes you an asshole, not necessarily the business deal you had with mom.", "NTA she signed the house over to you, she didn\u2019t pay bills for a while to help her purchase the apartment.  No is a complete sentence", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn't give her any money. She doesn't need it and their isn't Amy to give her anyways. \n\nIt's your money, so you get to decide what to do with it. \n\nIf she didn't ask to be repayed the down-payment then that's on hr and not your responsibility to fix.", "NTA- For 3 years, her and her husband supported her mother without contribution to said household so she could save up enough money to buy the condo. They have more than paid back her down payment. Why should they give her anything more?", "No.\n\n\nNTA.\n\nhonestly, that's it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
