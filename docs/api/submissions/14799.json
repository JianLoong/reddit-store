My mother (now 50F) dropped out of my life when I was 3.\n\nMy girlfriend (27F) and I live on the general grounds of my dad's \" estate.\" We agreed to do a home birth with a doula and midwife unless there were complications. Unfortunately however, she experienced issues throughout her pregnancy. \n\nWhen her labor started, she was throwing up and bleeding heavily. The midwife told us we needed to go to the hospital. So my gf's parents and I went. My dad hates hospitals, and spends a fortune on sourcing his medical care so he can avoid hospitals. So he refused to go.\n\nWe get to the hospital and the doctor was saying that they would try to honor her wish to not do a C Section, but if things get any worse, they need to do one.\n\nRight after we get there, I start getting calls from my dad. I ignore the first one but soon I have 17 missed calls and very angry texts saying that my girlfriend's brother was still there, is overly impressed by everything, and talks too much. He said he couldn't believe I left him alone with this annoying person.\n\nI tried to mitigate that situation by telling my gf's brother he can wait in the hospital waiting area. GF's brother leaves but then my dad texts saying he's all alone and asked why nobody wants to be in \" a sick man's\" company. \n\nI finally had enough of my dad's angst so I promised to go stay with him until his nurse came in. My dad brightened considerably. However, when I was home, my gf had an emergency C Section and my dad said there's no point in leaving now.\n\nNow that my daughter is born my girlfriend is furious and when i went to see my daughter, she refused to say a word to me except she was not going back to my dad's home. AITA? My dad has become very mournful and insecure as of late and I wanted to stop his anxiety.", "created_utc": 1681493136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m4n2n/aita_for_leaving_the_delivery_room_to_go_to_my_dad/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you hoping for a large inheritance or something? I cannot even fathom doing what you did.", "INFO: Do you work? Do you have an independent source of income that doesn't come from your father? Are you and your girlfriend in a position to move out of his estate? \n\nYTA for abandoning your girlfriend at the most vulnerable and scariest time of her life, and for missing your daughter's birth. Especially, because you were aware that your father wasn't in any kind of emergency, he simply \"wanted company\". \n\nBut I think your father is the biggest asshole here. I'm not sure why this is grossed over, but this sounds like a very wealthy man who had a baby with a 23 year old young woman when he was 64 years old; said woman took off after a few years and since then, it seems, he's been enrolled you as his companion and putting the responsibility of his overall wellbeing (outside of medical) on you. \n\nI might be wrong, of course. But the way in which you seem to feel compelled to cater to your father's every whim even in the most trying moments of your incipient family... I wonder if you're fully reliant on him financially or if this dependence is solely emotional. \n\nEither way, your father is toxic and is taking advantage of you. If you want to have a chance of your relationship and family working out, you need to listen to your girlfriend and move out of your father's estate with her and your daughter. And you need to cut the chord. Your father doesn't have much longer even if his health was superb, that's just life. You can spend quality time with him and enjoy the time you have left together, but you are now a partner and father first, and a son later. You absolutely cannot keep putting your father's needs above your family's, or you are going to lose them.", "YTA\n\nSo let's see... you abandoned your girlfriend, who was in the middle of an actual medical emergency, delivering your child, in order to go hang out with your dad, who was just throwing an old man tantrum and could absolutely have waited on his own while your child was born.", "Congratulations, you've only been a father one day and already fucked it up. \n\nYou missed the birth of your first child and left your partner alone to have a surgery she didn't want because your dad threw a tantrum. You should be ashamed. YTA", "YTA. Your gf truly needed you. She was living traumatic moments, her birth plans have been completely disrupted and her life was threatened... and you chose to go see your whining dad. You chose totally wrong here, and this is not something apologizing will fix.", "YTA\n\nLike father, like son.\n\nTo be frank, if this was you running to your mom instead of your dad, people would be calling you a momma's boy. Just let that sink in.", "I'm not going to call you an A, but you are your father's, bought and paid for, puppet. \n\nAt 64, he got a 23 year old pregnant, kept the child, and got rid of the child's (your) mother.\n\nWhen your girlfriend was giving birth, he flexed his power, and brought you to him, just to ensure he's still owns you.\n\nHe does.\n\nYou need counselling, I'm so sorry.", "Perhaps compassion is the root of your behavior, and codependency certainly is. \n\nBut of course you\u2019re the asshole! He was fine. He was trying to see what he could get you to do for him. And you fell for it. \n\nAnd your child was born. And your girlfriend needed you. And you weren\u2019t there. And she\u2019s not talking to you. And she won\u2019t live with your father anymore. And I get that. Your behavior is going to have consequences\n\nBut you need to examine this relationship with your father. It\u2019s not healthy as it is. I accept that he\u2019s the person who took care of you? But he\u2019s not doing so anymore. YTA", "How can you possibly think you are not the asshole? You should have turned your phone off and been there for your girlfriend while she was literally ripped apart to bring your baby into the world.

YTA", "YTA. When you feel you're \"done with your dad's bs,\" you should've put him on silent and supported your gf. She's in labor; he is lonely. Anyone can see who takes priority here. You should've let your father sulk for a few hours instead of abandoning your gf. I get that he doesn't like hospitals due to past experience, but think about how this day will be retold. If you had left your father alone he will say \"My son left me alone in the hospital to be with his pregnant gf.\" Now if anyone asks your gf about the birth she can say \"My bf decided that keeping his father company was more important than supporting me through the incredible pain that is giving birth.\" Hopefully you know which one sounds worse to any outside listener", "YTA wow  you really messed up. There is probably no coming back from this. Hope your dad's fee-fees were worth your relationship with your gf and baby. I would never forgive you for this.", "YTA. You missed the complicated birth of your daughter because of an old man\u2019s tantrum? And you\u2019re seriously asking if you are an asshole or not? Having zero self awareness makes it worse.

There is no coming back for you. You will never earn forgiveness for the level of this fuck up, nor should you. I don't believe somebody with your lack of judgment should be let near an infant.", "YTA. People like you remind me everyday why I\u2019ve chosen to stay single and not have kids. I\u2019m sorry to your girlfriend and baby.", "YTA your partner needed and wanted your support during a genuine medical crisis occuring during your child's birth, and you left her to appease your father, who was behaving like a small child not getting enough attention. This entire situation sounds unhealthy", "YTA. This is a mistake for which you will never truly be forgiven. Perhaps things with your girlfriend will get better in a week or two, followed by a lifetime together. But she will never, ever forget what you did and she will always hate that you did it.", "YTA-your first responsibility it to your GF and newborn.", "YTA \n\nThat\u2019s a potentially relationship ending decision and I wouldn\u2019t blame her one bit if she did leave.", "YTA Man you are a weak coward.  Maybe you shouldn't try do anything until your dad dies.  Hope the girlfriend and child gets away from your useless ass.", "100% TAH and a coward", "YTA, Your dad is also the AH. It's your daughter man, You got to be there. Your dad could have been with people if he would have just gone to the hospital where his FUCKING GRANDDAUGHTER was being born.

YTA, you can be lucky if you still have a girlfriend and are allowed to see your baby.", "YTA\n\nYour dad is a horrible man.  Your dad was not having a medical emergency, your wife was.  Your wife must have been terrified to have been having complications and then an unplanned c-section with you no where to be found\n\nYou need to learn something fast, your baby and your wife are your #1 priority, not your dad, who is a grade A  manipulator.  He knew what he was doing getting you to leave your wife\n\nHopefully the OB and nurses talk some sense into you. Your wife just had major abdominal surgery AND she has a newborn.  She needs help.  She wants you.  Don't brush this off as her parents are there, women want their partners.  She is already going to resent you for your poor judgement while she was in labor", "Yta seriously, I thought your dad had like, a heart attack and you rushed to him. \n\nHe is a grown ass adult and capable of kicking an in law out.", "Yeah no. YTA. Fuck this post.\n\nIn what world does your father being sad take priority over the birth of your damn child WHILE YOUR PARTNER HAS A C SECTION!?\n\nCongratulations, you ruined your relationship. I am so beyond baffled over how you thought this was a good idea.\n\nI'm also slightly concerned about the age gap. He was damn near triple her age when you were born. What the fuck.", "YTA\n\nSo, your 64yo father had a child with a 23yo, 27 years ago.\n\nIt sounds like your dad has made you into his emotional replacement for a spouse, and your dad is, and has likely always been, a very emotionally insecure and immature person. He manipulated you into showing that he's more important to you than your girlfriend, in a situation where you pretty much should have always chosen the woman in labor.\n\nYou need therapy.", "YTA....people are right, your dad played you like a fiddle.\n\nHe could've come to the hospital and waited in the waiting area. I get not liking hospitals. I hate them, due to my own health issues. But if you want to be a part of something like this, then you suck it up and go.\n\nHe got mad because your gf's brother was left behind and didn't like all the talking he did. Then got mad because he was left alone and played the \"oh no one loves me\" card. You fell right into the trap.\n\nTo top it off, you left your gf who ended up needing major surgery, and missed the birth of your daughter. I wouldn't speak to you for weeks if that was me.", "YTA and your father sounds manipulative asf. Giving birth, especially in a traumatic way as it sounds your gf had, is such a scary time and you want the support of your partner. You left her in the most vulnerable time in her life and missed the birth of your daughter which is such a magical and beautiful moment. She has every right to be furious with you and has a valid reason to leave you if she decides to do that.", "I hope you realize you (most likely and should) lost the relationship with your gf. She will never forgive you, I hope your dad\u2019s tantrum was worth it. Your daughter will never know a 2 parent home. You will never live with your daughter full time. You will have to see your gf (who I assume you love) be in a relationship with someone else when she moves on. You choose your dad\u2019s tantrum (not even a medical emergency) over your gf and daughters actual emergency. She will never trust you again. Be prepared to get custody and child support documents sent your way.", "YTA, and so is your dad. He is obviously a manipulative person, and you were dumb enough to miss the birth of your child because of his childish behavior. Your girlfriend has every right to be furious, and you better be buying a lot of flowers and chocolate.", "YTA.  You have more responsibilities than to your paranoid and self-absorbed father.  \"I don't like who is around me.  Oh, they're gone, now I'm lonely.  Well, your daughter is already born, so no need to go see her or your girlfriend.\"  You put your father's anxiety - which he caused himself - over your girlfriend being in a hospital giving birth to your daughter.  You fucked up, in a manner so massive that it may well affect your relationship with your girlfriend (who may not even be that for much longer, let alone anything beyond that) and your daughter.  Your father is also a huge AH for making the day of his granddaughter's birth about him.  Seriously, what.the.fuck.", "YTA: Your father manipulated you into putting him before your wife. He wasn't going to die. He was upset he was left with someone he didn't like then was left alone.\n\nYou lost the opportunity to experience your first child's birth and to be there to love and support your wife.\n\nYou shouldn't have to ask if you're the ah.", "YTA - I thought your dad was dying or something.  Nope.  In what world do you think pandering to your dad was going to make your gf was a good idea.  It was bad enough where she had to go to a hospital.", "YTA - you abandoned your wife and child because daddy doesnt know how to not act like a 5 year old??? Get a grip on your priorities fast an figure out how to make it up to your wife fast. \n\nYour family wasnt even a few hours new and already you messed up.", "YTA.  You made a massive mistake.  You left you girlfriend during one of the scariest and important times of her life to kept your father company.  That\u2019s it, you babysat your father instead of being there of two people who should be the most important people in your life right now.  Your father wasn\u2019t in a medical emergency, he was throwing a tantrum.  At best, it was because he has dementia, at worse it was a total power play to make sure he still owns you 100%. \n\nIf you truly love your girlfriend and daughter, you need to try and make amends NOW.  Apologize and mean it. You must make it crystal clear to your girlfriend that you completely understand what you was wrong and unacceptable in every way.  List exactly why you were wrong.  State what you should have done and how you will act in the future.  Then follow through with this and make sure you put them front and center in your life.", "YTA. You left gf in the most vulnerable moments of her life. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go back home to you either. WTF! When you start a family your SO, and kids always come first.

YOU SUCK.", "I understand that you don\u2019t seem to know this, but bleeding heavily is probably the biggest risk for death in childbirth. \n\nYour girlfriend was literally at risk for her life.

Im sure your gf and whoever she picks to be  your daughters step dad will raise her well, because you sure as fuck arent sticking around much longer.", "Yta do you know what a c section is? My God I just can't.....what if something had happened to yr gf or yr baby? Do you realize how serious that situation was. Yr dad sounds needy and manipulative. You just put him and his petty neediness over yr actual gf and child. I don't see you coming back from this.", "YTA for not prioritizing your gf but I recognize this must have been tough. Your dad was behaving like a selfish AH unless he has dementia.", "Yta, i thougt maybe your dad was going to have medical issues which woule have been am excuse, but you left your wife who was having complications to go hang with your dad because he was lonely. Thats insane.", "YTA.", "YTA I hope she never lets you near her kid and makes you pay child support", "YTA. Your girlfriend got the exact opposite kind of birth that she wanted. She wanted something natural and comfortable, instead she went through massive surgery that is mentally traumatic. Your girlfriend will always remember that the day your daughter was born she needed you and you weren't there. You have shown her that you are not reliable. That she and your daughter come second. She will never be able to trust you.\n\nYour dad was making a power play. And he won. I saw another comment here saying that if it was your mother you would be called mama's boy and it's the same thing. Your dad being lonely is not the same as your girlfriend bringing your daughter into the world in one of the most traumatic ways possible. He wasn't having a medical emergency, he was just waiting for a nurse. Your girlfriend's body was cut open and they took her organs out to bring your daughter into this world and you left her alone. \n\nI want you to let that sink in. Your dad's loneliness in your mind trumped your girlfriend being disembowled so that your daughter could survive. As a currently pregnant person, if my boyfriend did that I wouldn't have one anymore. I would be a single parent. Because it is now impossible for her to trust you.", "YTA  Time for you to grow up and become your daughter's Dad and not Daddy's boy!", "YTA- I was going with NTA until you said\nYou left because your dad was feeling \u201cannoyed\u201d and what does it mean that there is no point of leaving now ?

As someone who tried a natural birth and ultimately had a C section - you literally left your GF in a seriously dangerous time all because Daddy was sad.

Or very possibly just making excuses to control you. Not to mention, it sounds like he could have been with you if he'd wanted to be with you, but he *chose* not to come to the hospital (which is fine in itself.) And after his excuse for having you come to him was over he told you not to *bother* going back to your girlfriend and daughter *and you listened*.\n\nI know it can be really hard to say no to overbearing parents but... grow a spine.

My mother (now 50F) dropped out of my life when I was 3.\n\nMy girlfriend (27F) and I live on the general grounds of my dad's \" estate.\" We agreed to do a home birth with a doula and midwife unless there were complications. Unfortunately however, she experienced issues throughout her pregnancy. \n\nWhen her labor started, she was throwing up and bleeding heavily. The midwife told us we needed to go to the hospital. So my gf's parents and I went. My dad hates hospitals, and spends a fortune on sourcing his medical care so he can avoid hospitals. So he refused to go.\n\nWe get to the hospital and the doctor was saying that they would try to honor her wish to not do a C Section, but if things get any worse, they need to do one.\n\nRight after we get there, I start getting calls from my dad. I ignore the first one but soon I have 17 missed calls and very angry texts saying that my girlfriend's brother was still there, is overly impressed by everything, and talks too much. He said he couldn't believe I left him alone with this annoying person.\n\nI tried to mitigate that situation by telling my gf's brother he can wait in the hospital waiting area. GF's brother leaves but then my dad texts saying he's all alone and asked why nobody wants to be in \" a sick man's\" company. \n\nI finally had enough of my dad's angst so I promised to go stay with him until his nurse came in. My dad brightened considerably. However, when I was home, my gf had an emergency C Section and my dad said there's no point in leaving now.\n\nNow that my daughter is born my girlfriend is furious and when i went to see my daughter, she refused to say a word to me except she was not going back to my dad's home. AITA? My dad has become very mournful and insecure as of late and I wanted to stop his anxiety.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We don\u2019t have a colloquialism for a \u201cdaddy\u2019s boy\u201d and while again, the gender should not play a role in this, it does and it is vital that we are aware of such things to continuing rooting out harmful gender biases instilled and deeply rooted from a young age. It doesn\u2019t matter what gender the parent is, their power play was wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter what gender OP is. Their abandonment of their partner and child when they were their most vulnerable, was wrong.

So he's not responsible for attending his father in his old age then?

One might actually consider respecting, appreciating, and caring for their elders (the people who cared for them for 18+ years of their lives) as part of the life they live, and a responsibility, you know... out of gratitude to the person who CARED FOR THEM FOR 18+ YEARS minimum.   \n\n\n\n\nHmmm.. Dad should get full-time nursing care?  Perhaps.. Or maybe he figured a little help from a grateful son isn't too much to ask, you know for giving him a place to live, which may actually be costing dad.. perhaps enough to not be able to afford a full-time nurse.\n\n\n\n\nThere are any of 1000 reasons to miss the birth of a child.  One such reason for many has been as arbitrary and minor as traffic.....  I think we can dispense with that argument...   Birth is not an medical emergency.  It became emergent when they had to do a C section, but that was not an assured situation.   Instead of putting things so dismissively, how about we describe things accurately...  The reason he left was because his very old, sick, and frail father was alone, and wanted someone to be with him until his nurse showed up, or so the story says.  I hope like hell if you have children they think more of you than you seem to of the elderly at this point in your life.\n\n\n\nI do appreciate your sympathy, but I have to disagree with you regarding our elderly.  It is 100% our responsibility to provide the standard of care our parents provided us coming up when they are too old to care for themselves properly.  We may not be there when they need us most, and we will eventually be unable to prevent their death, but we should goddamned well try to be there and prevent it any time it is possible.   \n\n\n\n\nEvery day we perform triage in our lives deciding what aspect is most important to address at any given moment  In the moment where I know my wife is safe, the birth is being monitored by people I can trust I place the next in need of me at the top of triage, and my wife would not bat an eye at that because she knows me, loves me, and trusts me to do the best that I can, and right by her and everyone else that matters to me.", "I don't know if my misreading this makes things better or worse in my mind..

Sorry, Dad, you don\u2019t get to get rid of the caretaker and whine about being alone during your child\u2019s major life event. \n\nDad was 100% wrong here, and OP blindly followed him without a thought for his GF, who was in medical crisis and literally ripped open to bring his child safely into the world. She probably had endowed OP with medical decision making in her paperwork, too, so he really left her hanging and is damn lucky she didn\u2019t lose consciousness and further emergency decisions didn\u2019t need to be made in his absence.\n\nOP\u2019s relationship with GF is over. He has a chance to be a better father going forward; let\u2019s hope he rises to this challenge better.", "Considering the number of outright wrong things you said in the comment this was a reply to, we can be pretty sure that you don't, actually.", "On the other hand, it is the job of a child to honor respect, have loyalty, empathy love and care for their parent.  2 way street.  If the old man is in full control of his faculties and actually being manipulative then I could see my way to your way of thinking.   More information is needed to make that determination.  After the strokes, and the onset of dementia my mom seemed pretty normal at times, and way fucking off at others before she died.  At one moment the caring nurturing mom I always knew, the next telling me she hated me, I was a disappointment, and she couldn't understand why I was treating her \"that way\" (that way - was changing her diaper cleaning shit and sick off her, etc).   Back on point though.. The old man sounds more like he's not all there to me.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are right in your assumption, then I beg your pardon, you're right about the father.  I don't think that we will come to consensus on his son.", "If you say so", "I went back and reread it, and discovered this situation is worse than I initially thought.   My original understanding was the old guy was at home alone, but rereading tells me that he was actually at the hospital waiting room.   So now the picture is not that he went to take care of his old man who was off site.  No, he is being raked over the coals for having left the room, not the campus.", "One man's treasure is another man's trash.. Just saying it is not as life altering to some as others.   When I was very young, expectant fathers waited in the waiting room during a birth.  They did just fine.\n\n\n\n\nStrange way to put it.  He was still around post birth, and not 3 states away. Abandonment generally means \"not coming back.\"", "I appreciate your candor and concern, but at the same time, I don't write to be popular, my writing is expression.  If I am not truthful, then what's the point.  I see things differently, and as you said with some bias.  We can see it for what it is and accept our differences or not, but it is what it is.", "It is written confusingly.. I read initially he refused to go. and I see that in there, but the passage about the brother makes it seem like they are waiting in the lobby, and that is where the brother left him.", "Beyond stating some statistics what sort of medical comments have I made exactly?   You can disagree with me on the philosophical and interpersonal opinions I have, but not things I have neither discussed at any length or you know nothing about.", "You do not get honor and respect without giving honor and respect. Giving birth DOES NOT ENTITILE YOU TO THOSE. Period. \n\nOnce your child is an adult, their job is living their life, having a family if they choose, and doing what brings them joy. \n\nTheir top priority then becomes their spouse and kids. Never their parents. \n\nIt is the parents responsibility to make sure they are cared for once they can no longer care for themselves. NEVER THE CHILD'S. \n\nHaving a planned child is purely selfish on the parents part, and I say this as a parent.", ".... you're reading everything about this about as wrong as you could. Try reading again.", "Did you just call a child trash? You are disgusting.", "I'm not sure how you are getting to that conclusion. Why would the dad say that the brother was still there then and overly impressed by everything in a regular hospital and not a rich mans estate? At the end OP even says that when he was at home the gf finished with her c section so he obviously had to go home and not down to the waiting are/lobby.", "1. The death rate. \n2. That the mother is unconscious during the procedure. This is not typical even during an emergency. This is something they explicitly cover during childbirth classes, thus pretty much qualifying as common knowledge, never mind something that a medical professional would be expected to know. Many a woman can tell you about watching their organs getting pulled out. \n3. That the father would not be permitted to be in the room. \n\nQuestionable - That your spinal fusion surgery was more dangerous. Google suggests a nearly identical death rate - 13 per 100,000 - though \"complex\" cases specifically had a much higher rate. Then again, so do **emergency** c-sections.", "I suppose that is true if one is hatched from an egg.  We crazy mammals tend to become close knit with those we are raised by, and with. The virtue of being a someone's parent nets you their respect regardless because you are the authority in their life, and they cannot possibly know better as they grow.  If you come from someone and do not appreciate and honor them and the sacrifice they made in their life for you to exist then you have no honor, period.\n\n\n\n\nWe are not allegators or chickens, upon adulthood we don't, well some of us apparently, don't abandon our parents entirely to singlemindedly pursue or own lives and ambitions exclusively.  I suppose how  you evaluate the value of the people in your life is up to you, but those in mine count as equals.\n\n\n\n\n\nI truly find that next bit fascinating.   Put the parents on an ice flow, and watch them drift to the horizon.  Realize.. that is not normal, and many cultures who revere their elderly actually care for them to the point that they move into their kids house to finish out their lives.\n\n\n\n\nHaving planned children for some, myself included is the only way they will ever be born.  I would never have a child I was not 100% ready to support out the gate.", "Right?? What an odd phrase to come to mind when thinking of the birth of a child\u2026.", "FFS.. if that's what you got from the statement you are pretty dense.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me lay it out very plainly for you poindexter... \n\n\n\n\n\"Witnessing the birth of your child is not \u201csitting by and doing literally nothing.\u201d It is one of life\u2019s most profound moments.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis is not true for everyone... Get it? Got it? Good....", "ilikerelish has said so many completely wrong things in this comment section (in the literal, factual sense, not just in the 'I disagree with this' sense), that I'm getting tempted to think he's the father.", "1. Look it up.. Not hard to find that exact statistic published.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Where did I say that?\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Most hospitals at one time made men sit in the waiting room, things have changed.  Many will make people leave the room so as not to have witnesses that could be used to claim malpractice, some allow the father to be there, generally at the head end of the table.  Perhaps that has changed again without my notice.\n\n\n\n\nHuh.. so anesthesia applied via the spine can kill during birth, while anesthesia applied during major surgery can't?  All that while, it opens up your spine exposing the spinal cord, that controls not only motor function but involuntary functions of the body depending which level is being worked on.. Hmmm no danger there..   Maybe I should just go with what my Ortho told me, and say it was a fairly risky surgery...  You know.. cause I am so very wrong about so many things..."]}
