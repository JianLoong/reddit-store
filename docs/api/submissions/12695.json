They all live with her husbands mom since the early fall since they \u201cmoved\u201d out of their leased house (that\u2019s another story). My sister only contacts me when she needs cash. \nI moved out of my home town when I went to college and never moved back after graduating, I now live across the country from them and go home to visit every year. \n\n\nI know my parents gave her well over $10K about a month ago to help her find a new place to live b/c her mother in law wants them out of the house. So far, they have not moved out, nor from what I can gather talking to my mom have made any progress in finding a place to live. This morning my sister hits me up for cash promising she will pay me back next week ( over the years she has never repaid me once). \n\nThankfully my family and I live comfortably and giving her the cash will not create problems for us. I just want to know if I would be the asshole for asking her what exactly she does with her money each month? From my perspective, they live rent free (if not, I am sure here mother in law is not charging fair market value to live with her) and I know she has (maybe now it should be \u201chad\u201d the money my parents gave her). At this point, my parents (to a greater extent) and I have given her tens of thousands of dollars over the years and never seen a dime.  Her husband refuses to get another job and I don\u2019t know why her son won\u2019t get a job as well since he has been out of school now for quite some time.\n\nPersonally, I do carry some guilt for moving away to build my own life and shouldering her with the responsibility of taking care of our aging parents. While both of my parents are fully capable of taking care of themselves and still live fulfilling lives, I know eventually that will change and I am not in a position to move back to my hometown due to my military career. \n\nI just need a forum to vent and solicit advice.

They are taking care of her, her husband and her adult child. Of course, his parents are too.  You are giving donations to your sister, NOT a loan, so yes, you should know where it goes just like if I donate money to a cause.", "NTA, sounds like someone needs to get a j o b", "NTA. Formulate the nicest possible way to ask the question and plan on her getting upset anyway.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t recommend asking her because what would be the point? Clearly she lies about what she will do with the money (see: the 10k for moving out, and yet there has not been any moving), and if she did tell you the truth (spending it on random stuff instead of necessities), that probably wouldn\u2019t make you feel any better.\n\nEDIT \u2014 I missed the part about sister being the potential caregiver for the aging parents. OP, PLEASE sit down (virtually if need be) with your parents, a financial planner, and potentially an attorney. If they drain their retirement to pay for her lifestyle, what\u2019s going to happen? Who is the executor of their estate? Instead of giving the money to your sister, start saving now in case you will have to support your parents financially.", "Nta but why on earth are you enabling this leech? I'm sorry, I know she's your sister but this situation is utterly toxic for both of you.", "YWNBTA for asking. One's personal finances are normally their own business...until they repeatedly ask for help. At this point, they are making it your business. I don't see any particular benefit in asking, though. They obviously are not very savvy with finances and have no reason to change since handouts appear to work well for them.\n\nPersonally, I would not help her and would instead start a fund for helping your aging parents. Your parents are sending her money and one day they may need help. Tell your sister that there is no reason you can see why she and her family cannot exert the effort to earn money for themselves.", "If people keep giving your sister money, she will not do anything to support herself. Send her some bootstraps. NTA.", ">I do carry some guilt for moving away to build my own life and shouldering her with the responsibility of taking care of our aging parents.\n\nNTA, but you're balking at $100? Unless you want to suddenly be a whole lot more involved in her life and your parents' care, you better think twice about holding the line like this.  And no, you won't get repaid.\n\nA better use of effort would be talking to your parents about how they/you support her. Handing an irresponsible person $10Ks in cash is foolish. If you're willing to help, pay the housing or whatever directly instead of having it go through her.", "NTA\n\nShe's 51 years old; it's way past time for her to be responsible for herself. Your parents have been enabling her for years. The last thing you need to do is climb aboard the USS Enabler.\n\nSimple, \"I'm sorry, but we're unable to help you at this time\" should do. But it probably won't so be prepared for all the weeping, wailing & guilt tripping that she'll throw your way.", "NTA - She's a grown adult who clearly doesn't have her life together. You should not have guilt over taking care of yourself and bettering your life, she had the same opportunity. I guarantee that's what your parents wanted for the both of you. I'd 100% ask what happened to the money she was just given, not in an accusatory way, in a concerned way. \n\nA better question if you're determined to help her is to ask what she needs it for. If it's a bill, offer to pay it for her, if it's food, offer to have groceries delivered. Honestly, I'd stop helping her all together. We are also military and have family like this. I stopped helping many years ago because they never stopped asking and never did anything to better their situation.", "NTA but don't give her any money...best case scenario you're enabling her to be fiscally irresponsible and mooch off people, worst cast scenario you're enabling drug use or something.", "NTA- Your sister needs employment, your BIL needs a better job, and your nephew needs to find a job. 51 is too old for this silliness.", "Do not give her a cent. Offer to pay whatever bill she wants the money for directly. If you simply just hand her money like others have, she will not stop there and next thing you know you will be guilted enough to say yes everytime.\n\nNo is a full sentence too. YWNBTA", "YWNBTA Why do you feel you need to give her money? Three able-bodied adults should be able to manage. Why would you give money to someone who refuses to work? If you quit your job and refused to get another, would she help you? Have you considered that your sister and her family are being enabled and would rather get handouts than work to meet their needs?\n\nI don't think asking is wrong, but they may not tell you the truth anyway. If this is the way they live now, I don't think they will have much in the way of retirement or that their social security payments will be very high either. This is going to be a long-term problem and you need to decide where you will draw the line and say enough is enough. \n\nAs for being caretakers for your parents, they may never assume that role. If your parents have insurance, they might be able to have in-home care if needed. Don't assume a debt that has not been provided.\n\nGiving $100 is not the issue so much as enabling them to make bad choices and expecting you and your parents to finance the choices they are making. If this was a temporary hardship and they needed a little help it is ok. If they have no plans to rectify the financial issues, they are having then I would wonder if I was actually perpetuating the problem.", "You WNBTA. You should push them into giving you an explanation about why neither her, her husband, or their child can have a full time job. Assuming they\u2019re able bodied people, they\u2019re lazy free loaders and blatant about it because you and your family keep enabling it.", "I think you definitely have the right to ask where your money is going, especially if you\u2019re not getting it back, and I think you should have a conversation with your parents about your collective support of her, if she\u2019s blowing $10k in a month, you shouldn\u2019t have the burden of that out on you and your parents", "NTA. You aren\u2019t refusing to help again and your concern is valid. I would wonder if there are issues around drug and/or alcohol abuse that is occurring. Gambling maybe? Does your sister have a job? Are there disabilities that prevent them all from working? That the MIL is wanting them to move out is a red flag in my opinion too. Why does she want them out? Does she see them as taking advantage of her kindness by taking them in? Does she see what they do with the money that is being given?", "NTA\n\nThe way she is living is not healthy, responsible, or sustainable. You\u2019re a good sibling for trying to help her, but I think it would be smart to have a real conversation about what\u2019s going on. \n\nIt\u2019s concerning to see her blow that much more and seemingly have spent it on nothing of value. It\u2019s absolutely not your fault, but at this point you could be enabling some sort of addiction or chronic spending problem, and thus cause more harm than good. \n\nBottom line: you have some right to know what exactly your money is being spent on, and giving it to her conditionally might be the best move to help her learn responsibility.", "NTA\u2026.your sister cannot and should not expect her to subsidize her lifestyle.  I\u2019m wondering if she or husband has substance abuse issues or gambling issues and that\u2019s why she constantly needs cash.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t ask her where the money is going because you probably won\u2019t get an honest response.", "INFO: outside of your guilt, why do you never require she repays you before giving her additional money?\n\nWe are treated the way we allow ourselves to be treated.", "YWBTA.

You were entitled to do that and there is nothing to feel guilty about. Your sister chooses to stay with a man who refuses to step up for himself and the family he\u2019s created. She\u2019s choosing to allow her adult son to continue his example while continuing to demand that you and your parents be more responsible for their lives than they are willing to be.

If you have given her the money that is no longer your money but hers. \n\nIt sounds like all of this money that is being given is being blown and if that's the case she needs to learn how to manage and save money or its being stashed for some reason in which case she doesn't need to be given any more.", "YWNBTA - if she regularly being funds and her situation isn\u2019t improving then yep you should ask.", "NTA and please Dont ever give her money again. \n\nI know you didn't ask but please please please sit down with your parents and set up an estate or lawyer or someone else to care take for them when they need it.
