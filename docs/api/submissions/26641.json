And this is what it reads.\n\nABSOLUTELY NO SOLICITATION\n\nI WORK AT NIGHT SO IF YOU BANG ON MY DOOR RIGHT NOW YOU ARE GOING TO WAKE ME UP AND WILL NOT LIKE THE VERSION OF ME YOU MEET\n\nI DON'T NEED MY TREES TRIMMED\nI CUT MY OWN GRASS\nI ALREADY HAVE INTERNET\nMY CAR IS NOT FOR SALE\nAND I AM NOT LOOKING TO FIND JESUS\nUNLESS YOU ARE FROM THE USPS, UPS, FEDEX, OR AMAZON\n\nDO NOT BEAT ON MY DOOR!!!\n\n\nThis is worked fine until a few days ago, \n\nFor some extra context I was on day 18 of 21 straight at work (long story) and I had only went to bed about 2 hours earlier.\n\nIt's about 9:30 a.m. and I hear somebody beating at my door, and the moment later they start ringing the doorbell.\n\nI stumble out of bed put on just enough clothes to be decent and go look out the door to see three white haired old ladies that look to be in their '60s or '70s.\n\nI opened the door looking what had to be half drunk and half crazed and clearly pissed and very bluntly asked them what they wanted.\n\nThe first words out of their mouth are something about being from some church and trying to spread the word of this or that, at this point I just very bluntly cut them off and tell them this.\n\nSo I'm going to assume that at least one of you ladies can read right? Don't answer that, more of a rhetorical question. So here's my question assuming that all three of you can read I'm wondering how you all missed this gigantic sign on my door that blatantly says absolutely no solicitation and specifically mentions your kind as I pointed at the part about not looking for Jesus.\n\nTo make a long story short I got very loud and frankly quite belligerent and yelled at them to get the hell off my porch and told them that I wasn't looking to find Jesus but I was going to show them the devil if they ever beat on my door again.\n\nOne of them said they felt my attitude was uncalled for, and I told them that beating on my door when I had a sign clearly stating not to was uncalled for.\n\nI've told this story to a few people and opinions have been very split about it.\n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE?", "created_utc": 1694429810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fs9go/aita_for_yelling_at_three_old_church_ladies/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You gave ample warning, what more can you do?\n\nOld people usually have this attitude where they believe that they are free to roam the earth as they please without any repercussions. You are the hero in this story, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.", "NTA: They were very disrespectful of your wishes. While I'm all for \"respecting your elders\", I feel it should go both ways. You expressed that you wanted to be left alone during the day in plain writing and they chose to ignore that. As someone who also used to work nights and slept during the day, I completely understand unleashing the beast when being rudely awoken by solicitors or Jehovah's Witnesses (those were the worst). I'm completely on your side.", "NTA\n\nNext time, answer the door naked and START with cussing.", "NTA\nI'd also add a front door cam and remote sprinklers\nIf I see those \nI'd check who's at the door from my bed and \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6", "You're NTA.

Some people just don\u2019t get it until you yell in their faces. They were so cocksure that their good intentions would get them past anything, when in reality they were being extremely rude. Maybe this will be a wake up call for them, but probably not. Most of those types of churches are an echo chamber far worse than Fox ~~~News~~~ Fiction.", "NTA at all they need to learn to respect privacy.\n\nThey are old enough to know better, yet they often use the \"I am Elderly\" card as a shield from reprisals, doesn't fly with me and shouldn't with anyone else.", "NTA.

I just opened the door and let my French Mastiff out. (He was a big old baby but looked and sounded terrifying). Best laugh ever!

I hate these religious people!!!!!", "NTA, next time make sure to have spray or bubble gun near the door. spray the fuckers who cant read. i had some really obnoxious witnesses that wanted to sold their darn watchtower to me for 5 days straight. it only stopped after i caught them with the garden hose. darn watchtower is not waterproof xD", "NTA, even remotely. A super soaker filled with cat pee would only be mildly over the two at this point", "NTA I\u2019m rude as all get out to these Jesus people who come to my door.

I would have called their church and told off the pastor, too lol", "NTA", "As someone who was visited by 2 JW today who interrupted me while working you have my full support to yell at church ladies who lack either reading comprehension or are just rude.
