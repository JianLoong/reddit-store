And this is what it reads.\n\nABSOLUTELY NO SOLICITATION\n\nI WORK AT NIGHT SO IF YOU BANG ON MY DOOR RIGHT NOW YOU ARE GOING TO WAKE ME UP AND WILL NOT LIKE THE VERSION OF ME YOU MEET\n\nI DON'T NEED MY TREES TRIMMED\nI CUT MY OWN GRASS\nI ALREADY HAVE INTERNET\nMY CAR IS NOT FOR SALE\nAND I AM NOT LOOKING TO FIND JESUS\nUNLESS YOU ARE FROM THE USPS, UPS, FEDEX, OR AMAZON\n\nDO NOT BEAT ON MY DOOR!!!\n\n\nThis is worked fine until a few days ago, \n\nFor some extra context I was on day 18 of 21 straight at work (long story) and I had only went to bed about 2 hours earlier.\n\nIt's about 9:30 a.m. and I hear somebody beating at my door, and the moment later they start ringing the doorbell.\n\nI stumble out of bed put on just enough clothes to be decent and go look out the door to see three white haired old ladies that look to be in their '60s or '70s.\n\nI opened the door looking what had to be half drunk and half crazed and clearly pissed and very bluntly asked them what they wanted.\n\nThe first words out of their mouth are something about being from some church and trying to spread the word of this or that, at this point I just very bluntly cut them off and tell them this.\n\nSo I'm going to assume that at least one of you ladies can read right? Don't answer that, more of a rhetorical question. So here's my question assuming that all three of you can read I'm wondering how you all missed this gigantic sign on my door that blatantly says absolutely no solicitation and specifically mentions your kind as I pointed at the part about not looking for Jesus.\n\nTo make a long story short I got very loud and frankly quite belligerent and yelled at them to get the hell off my porch and told them that I wasn't looking to find Jesus but I was going to show them the devil if they ever beat on my door again.\n\nOne of them said they felt my attitude was uncalled for, and I told them that beating on my door when I had a sign clearly stating not to was uncalled for.\n\nI've told this story to a few people and opinions have been very split about it.\n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE?", "created_utc": 1694429810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fs9go/aita_for_yelling_at_three_old_church_ladies/", "score": 1976, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just becuase they're supposed to spread the word of God doesn't give them the right to disturb people like that, especially someone who very clearly has signs on their door saying \"no soliciting\".", "NTA.", "NTA.  Your sign was VERY clear. They should\u2019ve definitely read the sign and walked away. They were warned. It\u2019s on them! \n\nI grew up banging on peoples\u2019 doors, cold call selling religion door-to-door as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. (Haven\u2019t done that in a few decades.) I was chased off of a fully awake person\u2019s property with a gun. There was NO sign and I hadn\u2019t even made it half way up the driveway.", "I LOVE your style!\n\nOh yeah, NTA", "NTA\n\nI hate that BS. If someone is interested in finding religion or joining a church then there are plenty resources available to them to do so. There is zero need for bible bashers to harass people in their homes.", "NTA, I don't even work nights, and I absolutely despise people coming to my door for anything. My opinion is, if I don't know you then there's simply no reason for you to come to my house and try to talk to me...", "NTA, entirely. People who pound on your door while you\u2019re sleeping when a sign clearly outlines the situation\u2026 well, they need a perfect stranger to knock loudly on their doors at 2 a.m. Of course, this would cause all kinds of trouble. Nobody should ignore a no-soliciting sign, period.", "NTA", "NTA 1000%.  I have zero tolerance for anyone knocking on my door when I didn\u2019t invite them to.  They deserved what they got.", "NTA, and I work at a church. If you remember what church they\u2019re from, call the pastor/priest and tell him what they did and that they\u2019re giving his church a bad name. If he doesn\u2019t respond apologetically, go leave them reviews on google/etc.", "NTA, and TBH you were nicer than I was the last time I lost my shit at a door preacher", "You forgot to tell the old ladies; \"If you old bags are too dumb to read and comprehend this sign, why do you think anyone would give a rat's rectum about your beliefs? You are obviously so stupid that the only thing you might be good for is being on a poster for advertising planned parenthood services.\n .", "Bahahahahahaha NTAH", "NTA, and you need to find a way to activate your sprinklers from inside so the next time some illiterate assclown high on their own farts pounds on the door, you can hose them down without having to engage with them.", "NTA. I had a similar issue with visitors while my kids were babies. They would always arrive at nap time. Put up a sign on my doorbell. Most people were good about it. I do believe one person got similar treatment to what you dished out from me. Don\u2019t wake a mamma bear at nap time!!! \ud83d\ude02", "NTA I\u2019ve done the exact same. I was 7 or 8 months pregnant, had crackhead neighbors that had kept me up all night, and just after my then husband left for work, this tiny bald man (I\u2019m 5\u20192 and was noticeably taller) knocked on my door to talk about Jesus. I unleashed the full force of sleep deprived, pregnant crazy at him, and he ran tf down my stairs. I personally can\u2019t stand the Jesus brigade showing up at my door. These days I just tell them they have come to the wrong house, we\u2019re witches. But that dude pissed me off something fierce. \n\nI just moved, to a largely Muslim neighborhood, and luckily haven\u2019t seen any Jesus people here. Hopefully it stays that way.", "they are not soliciting. They want to talk about Jesus  (and hopefully join there religion...has to be Jehovah Witness)  This is how they see it.\n\nshould ask all door solicitors if they a have a permit to solicitation", "NTA", "Fuck those old ladies", "NTA.", "Nta, fellow night shift worker here and it brings me great pride that the churchy people from the church across the street now automatically skip my house....only answered the door naked once.....", "NTA you should have called the cops.for trespassing.", "NTA... I wish I could be more like you. Instead, I am stuck at my door for 15 minutes, thinking of a polite way to say, \"F off.\"", "NTA\n\nThat preachy crap is all coming from a place of assumption and judgment.\n\nYou should have asked them, *\"How many homeless people did you have to step over to come tell the guy with a roof over his head, food in his belly, and clothes on his back, what he's missing in his life???\"*", "NTA, dumb people need to be told where to get off from time to time, good job", "NTA!\n\nYou're a hero in my book.", "If it was the middle of the day, you were wide awake, and had no sign up you'd still be NTA. \n\nSolicitors are the worst.", "NTA 100% -- I once did something similar when some very \"nice looking old ladies\" from a church rang my doorbell, woke up my sleeping baby and then made a joke about me having a relaxing morning because I was still in my PJs.\n\nYou had a very belligerent sign which made it EXTREMELY clear that they were not going to be treated with kindness.", "NTA. I've been there. Sucks when you're working long hours, just want some uninterrupted sleep, and someone wakes you up for a nonurgent thing.\n\nYeah, your reaction to three old ladies was harsh, but you had what sounds like a very clear sign up that they just ignored.", "NTA. They're lucky they didn't get a buddy of mine who answered the door naked, hungover and errect.", "I hope you literally told them to fuck off! Nothing more arrogant than a proselytizer!", "Jesus if you believe about him should be everywhere and there is churches everywhere. So why tf people would need to knock to your door if they arent a sect.\n\nI would have the same reaction", "Plus if they gave a shit at all about actually winning people over, they would not go around pissing people in the name of their religion.", "OPs belligerence imo is very justified and their whole post is the reason  I love being in military housing, it's housing on federally owned land and legally where I live you cannot solicit federally owned buildings. And if someone does try and solicit for whatever reason they are very quickly removed. It's actually fantastic.", "Christians are the main reason I fucking *hate* proselytizing. Idgaf about their good intentions, because they sure as shit don't excuse their shitty behavior. They wanna call *me* a heathen for liking the moon and nature, but they think they're being little angels while banging on a sleeping man's door \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This, they actually make smart sprinklers now you can control with your phone - I think they are Orbit brand, not sure though.", "It's totally wrong, but I envision OP's having sprinklers that point at the porch, and he has a remote activation on his phone.", "Oh missionaries can be so annoying. Our neighborhood has very specific no soliciting signs, but they still show up a couple times a month no matter how many times we tell them to piss off. They do everything you mentioned, but also put these brochures in the most annoying places. Someone left their car window open just a crack and woke up to dozens of brochures slipped inside in a huge paper mess. They've also thrown them in back yards, mail boxes, and other places that really annoy my neighbors.", "Lmao \u201caren\u2019t selling anything\u201d my ass. Never been to a church that didn\u2019t pass around a collection plate.", "Highly recommend rigging a hose or sprinkler system on the porch which can be selectively activated from inside your front door. It does mean you're already up and disturbed, but they won't be back! Church ladies hate to get their hair and makeup spoiled. \n\nNTA", "Phone people in low income neighborhoods, which they are *really really* not supposed to do.", "I've had similar conversations with Witnesses before. Their eyes get really big when I offer to read Scripture with them and pull out my Greek New Testament.\n\nEdited to add: a major part of JW theology is based on a grammatically incorrect (not merely a theologically contentious passage, but literally and actually grammatically wrong) reading of a bit from the Gospel of John, so I always offer to translate it for them.", "I like you.", "Sometimes the law does define words differently than their ordinary meaning", "Yup, and campaigns keep track of who they've talked to, so you're not going to be a repeat offender unless the prior campaign worker marked you down wrong. Just say \"no thanks and please don't come here again.\" It's not hard to be polite. We don't pound on people's doors, though, since we're not a religious operation and not trying to convince you who to vote for, so we'll just leave lit. \n\nYou can also just not answer the door. Some modern doorbells can have quiet hours if you work night shift and don't want to be disturbed.", "I got tired of the religious door spam, and bought a large wooden pentacle to hang right by my doorbell.  It has worked like a charm.", "Try buying a horror movie mask, or get a full length cloak with a hood. You couod have some rwla fun with that, like answering the door with \"give me your soul\" or something else dementory ect.", "Were you still a mormon when you went to Utah, or only in Cali?\nMormonism outside of Utah is *vastly* different. They straight up try and intimidate you in Utah. Had them knocking on my door nearly everyday, first with two people, then 3, and then 5 at a time at my door! In an apartment that said that shit wasn't tolerated, too. \n\nObviously, experiences differ, but they are very strict in Utah versus other places.", "I agree; UT Mormons are different. But I've found them to be more indifferent. Like, they're the majority here,  so if you're not coming to church,  they're not going to bother with you. They're friendly enough,  but it's skin deep. I have lots of work friends who are Mormon, but outside of work,  they've got lots of family obligations,  and I'm pretty introverted, anyway.\n\nI've never had Mormons knocking on my door here, though. My daughter went to church a little after we moved here even though I didn't. She stopped going around 12 or 13, and no one bothered us. But I live in SLC, so it's not nuts here.\n\nI've been visiting SLC since I was a kid because my mom's family lives here. Most of her family here aren't Mormons.  They don't have missionaries bothering them. I think in small podunk towns,  there probably is more pressure to be Mormon and go to church,  but in the SLC area (I'm in Murray now), it's just not a big deal. \n\nIf there are missionaries regularly coming to someone's door, it's because another Mormon, usually a relative,  is calling the missionaries and requesting they visit. That would be obnoxious, but it's also more down to the intrusive family members."]}
