And this is what it reads.\n\nABSOLUTELY NO SOLICITATION\n\nI WORK AT NIGHT SO IF YOU BANG ON MY DOOR RIGHT NOW YOU ARE GOING TO WAKE ME UP AND WILL NOT LIKE THE VERSION OF ME YOU MEET\n\nI DON'T NEED MY TREES TRIMMED\nI CUT MY OWN GRASS\nI ALREADY HAVE INTERNET\nMY CAR IS NOT FOR SALE\nAND I AM NOT LOOKING TO FIND JESUS\nUNLESS YOU ARE FROM THE USPS, UPS, FEDEX, OR AMAZON\n\nDO NOT BEAT ON MY DOOR!!!\n\n\nThis is worked fine until a few days ago, \n\nFor some extra context I was on day 18 of 21 straight at work (long story) and I had only went to bed about 2 hours earlier.\n\nIt's about 9:30 a.m. and I hear somebody beating at my door, and the moment later they start ringing the doorbell.\n\nI stumble out of bed put on just enough clothes to be decent and go look out the door to see three white haired old ladies that look to be in their '60s or '70s.\n\nI opened the door looking what had to be half drunk and half crazed and clearly pissed and very bluntly asked them what they wanted.\n\nThe first words out of their mouth are something about being from some church and trying to spread the word of this or that, at this point I just very bluntly cut them off and tell them this.\n\nSo I'm going to assume that at least one of you ladies can read right? Don't answer that, more of a rhetorical question. So here's my question assuming that all three of you can read I'm wondering how you all missed this gigantic sign on my door that blatantly says absolutely no solicitation and specifically mentions your kind as I pointed at the part about not looking for Jesus.\n\nTo make a long story short I got very loud and frankly quite belligerent and yelled at them to get the hell off my porch and told them that I wasn't looking to find Jesus but I was going to show them the devil if they ever beat on my door again.\n\nOne of them said they felt my attitude was uncalled for, and I told them that beating on my door when I had a sign clearly stating not to was uncalled for.\n\nI've told this story to a few people and opinions have been very split about it.\n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE?", "created_utc": 1694429810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fs9go/aita_for_yelling_at_three_old_church_ladies/", "score": 1079, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be nice if there were a way to persuade them to leave otherwise, or maybe even think about the nonsense they're spewing, but there really isn't. And I would not recommend that anyone humors them and listens to the whole pitch. That's also just reinforcing the idea that the people who don't just sit there and listen to them are actively \"against Jesus\" or whatever silly notion their church leaders have come up with.", "> They are just spreading the good word, which is free!\n\nToo bad the definition of Solicitation doesn't include the word \"cost\" or \"money\" in any way whatsoever.\n\nYou can solicit people for all kinds of things, not just for money. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you aren't selling people things, solicitation is solicitation.", "Clearly you need to start answering the door with a water pistol in hand. Word should spread fast.", "Oh, I LOVE YOU", "You, like everyone else, has a first amendment right to convince others to vote for your chosen candidate. The Supreme Court has been very clear that this is not solicitation. \n\nIgnoring a sign suggesting you come back at another time is just plain stupid. We're also trained to ring the doorbell or knock once, and leave literature if the person doesn't answer. We also aren't trying to convince anyone.

There\u2019s a hall up the road from where we live.\n\nMy husband will always engage them in a very friendly way and tell them about why he\u2019s a satanist.

I\u2019ll come down sometime and we can have a longer chat.\u201d\n\nThey usually make excuses and leave at that point.

Ineffective, they are taught to not listen to polite declination. \n\nYou tell them to fuck off because they didn't listen to you when you tried to be polite?

If there's a sign on the door, and you think that's a suggestion or an invitation to return later, you are mistaken. It is a demand to be left alone. \n\nAnd sorry, no court gets to actually redefine the simple reality that if you go around trying to persuade people of things at their doorstep, you are soliciting. And you can get lost. They have a right to walk around saying whatever nonsense and lies they wish, but everyone else has the right to tell them to fuck off out of their faces. \n\nEvery \"No Soliciting\" sign is directed at you. If you knock or rign just once, you have decided to ignore it because you think you're special. And it also means they don't want your literal garbage left on their property either.
