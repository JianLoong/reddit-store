You have no idea as to what bio dad is saying to the child. She is obviously being negatively impacted by the calls.", "I completely understand your feelings but solving this is not your role to take on. You are her mother's fiancee.

Did you speak to her paternal grandparents about this yourself? if so, why?", "INFO\n\nIs there a reason the bio dad communicates via the grandparents instead of communicating directly?\n\nDoes he have an ulterior motive?  Is he trying to avoid a conflict?", "What country is the father from? Was your wife permitted to take her daughter with her when she fled her home country?", "I may have an unpopular opinion, but you should not prevent contact with bio parent. Because when we shield kids, they often romanticise their bioparent, and it will never go the good way, either they will be hurt even more, cause of a build up feelings, or they will deny any bad things and enable the bioparent. And if you prevent, it can cause resentment and it can be used against you, even if your intentions were pure and out of love. \nThere are many situations when the child was protected and never saw abuse or neglect and they try to connect. \n\nWhat I advise you is to get a therapist for your stepdaughter and try to help her through those feelings. She is seven, so you can start explaining why her mom left with her, age appropriately ofc. And talk to her, kids often surprise us with their openness", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We found out about this occuring last night so I was simply trying to get other perspectives about the right mindset to approach this cause for me it's not about taking anything from the grandparents cause it's both me and my fiances belief that it technically isn't their responsibility to set those boundaries that's ours but we plan on speaking to them today since we now have a solution that we both agree on", "Colombia .

I don't care what she calls you (which it is weird as hell she calls you 'Dad' and you say that you've raised her, since they only moved to wherever you are 1.5 years ago... how long have you even been together?). That is her bio parent. It is not up to you to decide what communication rights they have. It's not your place to insert yourself between them.

He absconded his rights , does not meet his financial requirement and has not for a period of almost 4 years which in our state where we reside does result in you losing parental rights .

Totally not weird when a child feels that way and is allowed to make her own decision about who deserves that title . Biology has nothing to do with being an actual parent, it's who shows up , who raises them who does all the actual parenting . We've been together 4 years . It is absolutely my place when I'm the one comforting her cause her dad refuses to be present , when I'm the one consoling her tears cause her dad can't pick up a phone for 6 months but can absolutely pick up a phone to call his other child .

Totally get that , I worked abroad before in her country that's where I entered the picture then when she moved here we got engaged. So I understand", "Okay I can understand a little better now, the way it sounded at first it really sounded like you were overstepping but I think by this point you and your fiance both should have a say in this. I will edit my post.", "Totally understand why you felt that way given the context provided . I appreciate your feedback and honesty", "It's inappropriate for the grandparents not to have discussed this with her mum but you need to understand you don't get a vote in the decision. This is between the parents of this child, you are only a step parent.\n\nI've been a family lawyer a long time and I want to give you this warning. Right now your step daughter is a young child, her emotions aren't very complex and being homesick and missing her father (which is what I assume you mean by sad) while not positive emotions are normal and important for her development. I get that you probably think this man doesn't deserve his daughters love and you may even be right, however, if you try to interfere with her relationship with her father in anyway that is not positive then in 5 years she will hate you. All the sadness, homesickness, abandonment etc she's feeling now will be projected solely on to you. You will be the focal point of every negative feeling she has about her situation. You need to step back and let your wife handle it. If he's a deadbeat then as your step daughter grows older she will slowly come to understand that and cope with the emotions it causes. If you become involved I guarantee you, you will be blamed for his actions because it's emotionally easier to blame you and keep the idea that her dad's great it's the evil step father keeping them apart.\n\nAlso you aren't even married to your partner yet. This is really got nothing to do with you right now, let your intended and her parents discuss the situation and come to a solution. It may be worth keeping it as is but just letting your wife know when calls occur.", "YTA.  The man is the child's father, you are not!  It is a good thing that the has been trying to contact his daughter as it is important for HER to know that he still loves and cares about her!!!!  According to your additional comments, he allowed her to come to the U.S. to flee violence.  That is a good thing and shows that he cares about her wellbeing even if it means he doesn't get to see her.  That he hasn't done everything perfectly, like paying child support, is beside the point.  It has only been a year and a half since this happened so perhaps his life has been in turmoil as well and he is now getting reestablished.", "NTA You are not trying to stop the calls - you just want to co-parent so that you can help your daughter. That is reasonable. Stop talking about money etc - it conflates the issue.", "NTA!", "What does the custody agreement say. Does it exclude the father from seeing or talking to his daughter?  Even if he isn\u2019t paying support doesn\u2019t give you a right to deprive the child of their father. By not allowing contact he could go to the courts and claim he is being refused communication with his daughter and can gain full custody. He may have given permission for her to move but he\u2019s her parent equally to the mom", "It sounds like this is for your fiance to decide. If she doesn't want this to happen, she should stop leaving her child alone with the inlaws.

Unfortunately it looks like it\u2019s the dynamic that this family is in is that her father is at a distance and Op\u2019s perspective that he\u2019s immature. Hasn\u2019t been in contact. Seems to be an uneducated point of you because he has been in contact. Just Op has not been aware of it. I don\u2019t know if the child\u2019s mother has been aware, but Op certainly doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s been aware. I\u2019d be careful if I was Op offered anything more than the support that the mother is asking for because this is not really Op\u2018s role. I don\u2019t know what the solution is, but I\u2019m not certain it\u2019s automatically no contact with that. Also with the displacement from dad, further separating the child from the grandparents also seems to be right with possible negative consequences as well, my suggestion would be counseling all around, and a frank conversation between the biological parents to be on the same page", "I wonder if it's a cultural thing? Grandparents, mom, kid are all one culture and OP isn't. Are the grandparents happy their daughter is marrying outside of her culture? Are they trying to get their daughter and her ex back together?", "There is no custody agreement as I previously stated . He has no rights nor is it being discussed to deprive him of anything . He has nothing , can't do nothing , and unless your a law scholar well versed in Colombian - U.S family laws I think your opinion on that is unwarranted and completely unsolicited as it has nothing to do with the post . Thanks !", "That sounds like he still keeps the paternity. He is her father whether you like it or not.", "Court of law would say it\u2019s none of your business and it ends there.", "Hopefully the fiance will understand the parents knew what they were doing was wrong because the kept it hidden.

Even though he's still in their home country?\n\nI'm not saying he's the world's best dad or that his role is any more important than yours, but your daughter needs the phone calls she does get.  Kids attach so strongly to family members.  It hurts them when people are cut out or missing.\n\nYour in-laws absolutely should have talked to their daughter about this before coordinating phone calls with your wife's ex.  BUT it's not necessarily a bad thing for your daughter to be able to talk to her bio dad without her mom having conflict with him during the call.  It is good for the kid to see their dad even if he's never paid child support.\n\nIt might not be good for your wife or easy for you, but the homesickness and grief are important emotions that your daughter needs to work through.", "I don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t talk to her father.  It sounds like he is not financially supporting her but that\u2019s not her fault.  Parents don\u2019t pay for the privilege of speaking to their children.  That\u2019s not what child support or lack of is for.  If the mom would allow communication then the father could speak to the daughter at home and the mom possibly could get a better understanding of whether the calls are making her sad.  Maybe she\u2019s sad because she is talking to her father behind her mother\u2019s back and feels guilty.  Who knows? Maybe he\u2019s being an ass to her.
