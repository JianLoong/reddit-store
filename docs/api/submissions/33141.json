It sounds like your fiancee's parents should not have unsupervised visits with your stepdaughter if they are going to do this kind of thing behind both your backs.", "You should not insert yourself into this, other than communicating with your fianc\u00e9.\n\nThis is for you and your fiancee to discuss, and she should be the one to set up the boudaries with her parents.\n\nYWBTIA if you were the one communicating with your fianc\u00e9's parents.", "NTA.  I may be going against what others suggest. First, stop visiting grandparents until they abide by your rules. Second, pause the calls with dad until the child is more stable or mature.  You have no idea as to what bio dad is saying to the child. She is obviously being negatively impacted by the calls.", "I completely understand your feelings but solving this is not your role to take on. You are her mother's fiancee. If the mom feels this way she will need to express it to her in-laws herself or explain that visits will be limited to when she is there to supervise. You getting involved is bad for EVERYONE here.", "Did the father agree for her to leave the country? is the child support court mandated? \nwhy are you referring to yoursekf as the father of the child? you are not related by blood adoption or marriage, correct? Did you speak to her paternal grandparents about this yourself? if so, why?", "INFO\n\nIs there a reason the bio dad communicates via the grandparents instead of communicating directly?\n\nDoes he have an ulterior motive?  Is he trying to avoid a conflict?", "What country is the father from? Was your wife permitted to take her daughter with her when she fled her home country?", "I may have an unpopular opinion, but you should not prevent contact with bio parent. Because when we shield kids, they often romanticise their bioparent, and it will never go the good way, either they will be hurt even more, cause of a build up feelings, or they will deny any bad things and enable the bioparent. And if you prevent, it can cause resentment and it can be used against you, even if your intentions were pure and out of love. \nThere are many situations when the child was protected and never saw abuse or neglect and they try to connect. \n\nWhat I advise you is to get a therapist for your stepdaughter and try to help her through those feelings. She is seven, so you can start explaining why her mom left with her, age appropriately ofc. And talk to her, kids often surprise us with their openness", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is NOT his fight.", "NTA, but your fiance needs to set the boundaries, make the decision to supervise contact with the grandparents, etc not you.", "Yes he signed an affidavit waiving his right to contest her traveling to do so . The support is court mandated in her country . I am referring to myself as the father cause that's what she (the daughter and mom) have defined me as . We are getting married next month so not yet your correct. We found out about this occuring last night so I was simply trying to get other perspectives about the right mindset to approach this cause for me it's not about taking anything from the grandparents cause it's both me and my fiances belief that it technically isn't their responsibility to set those boundaries that's ours but we plan on speaking to them today since we now have a solution that we both agree on", "Colombia . Yes he signed an affidavit giving consent and revoking any future right to contest her travel or residency anywhere .", "Yup! I agree. Kids eventually start to see for themselves what the parent is actually like. I think I was 8/9 when I started to resent my dad. My mother never talked badly about him and would make me call him. Eventually you\u2019re like well why doesn\u2019t he bother calling me or seeing me or doing xyz. I think it\u2019s better for them to come to that realization other own sadly. \n\nIt\u2019s also not his place yet, I know they\u2019re gonna get married but he\u2019s only know the kid for a year and a half it seems. He hasn\u2019t built enough trust up with this kid to start putting his 2 cents in, at least not in front of her. He should keep talking with the fiance and support w.e decisions she wants to make", "You should read better , it is 100% my business , my child too (both their own decision and words to say I am ) . She's 100% against it too she had no clue as I said In the post . So for all you know you shouldn't tell me what I need to do .", "Lol it is my business when I'm the one she calls dad, I've raised her , pay the bills . Come back with a real reply not being an edge lord", "Totally agree it's not a bad thing , I'm not trying to keep that from her , she still has the same opportunities to talk to him with the request I made just not through the grandparents", "Please talk to your partner before doing anything. It's important to make sure the two of you are on the same page.

She isn\u2019t your daughter- if she was this would be a non issue. It isn\u2019t your place. You are a legal stranger to all involved\nYta for not really wanting the truth", "I'm not being an edgelord. It's not your business. I don't care what she calls you (which it is weird as hell she calls you 'Dad' and you say that you've raised her, since they only moved to wherever you are 1.5 years ago... how long have you even been together?). That is her bio parent. It is not up to you to decide what communication rights they have. It's not your place to insert yourself between them. If there is a legitimate concern, you need to go to whatever version of family services you have and have them decide on what is appropriate. Also if she's confused and conflicted, YTA again for not getting her some form of therapy for this and what she's been through. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Are you the parent of the child? Are you married to the mother? Do you have legal guardianship of the child? Since the answer to all of those is no, you have zero right to request/demand anything when it comes to the communication of the child with her ACTUAL parent. Stay in your lane, your fiance is the one who has to handle this. Not you.", "I never said mind your business I said make sure you know the facts lol . Secondly , SHE feels that she is my daughter and so does mom so that's not the debate here or the question at hand , it's not a legality issue it's a moral one . My fiance feels it is otherwise I wouldn't know anything about it and wouldn't be here talking about it . Keep your law degree hidden cause it's not serving you well . He absconded his rights , does not meet his financial requirement and has not for a period of almost 4 years which in our state where we reside does result in you losing parental rights . And seeing as U.S Immigration legally classified me as dad too for their citizenship apps when they were approved I'm everything but a legal stranger . Try again", "Totally when your only reply is mind your business instead of saying this which is a legitimate viewpoint. Totally not weird when a child feels that way and is allowed to make her own decision about who deserves that title . Biology has nothing to do with being an actual parent, it's who shows up , who raises them who does all the actual parenting . We've been together 4 years . It is absolutely my place when I'm the one comforting her cause her dad refuses to be present , when I'm the one consoling her tears cause her dad can't pick up a phone for 6 months but can absolutely pick up a phone to call his other child . Family services is for instances of abuse or neglect that's not the case here", ">Totally not weird when a child feels that way and is allowed to make her own decision about who deserves that title\n\nI guess I'm just confused by the timing of everything. Your story makes it sound like you haven't been in the picture very long with them only having moved to the US 1.5 years ago.", "That's what I'm saying , I'd agree it would be weird if I had been like \"I'm your dad now \" or \" since he isn't around it's me now not him \" but that's never been the case we've always supported and encouraged her to make her conclusions and decisions when it comes to how she saw me and how that relationship evolved . Totally get that , I worked abroad before in her country that's where I entered the picture then when she moved here we got engaged. So I understand", "Okay I can understand a little better now, the way it sounded at first it really sounded like you were overstepping but I think by this point you and your fiance both should have a say in this. I will edit my post.", "Totally understand why you felt that way given the context provided . I appreciate your feedback and honesty"]}
