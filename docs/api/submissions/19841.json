Hope this is a one-off incident and not typical for her.", "NTA, it's a wedding she can't bring a plus one if she isn't offered one. Plates go from $75 and up depending on the wedding. The bride didn't want you there like you mentioned. It sounds like your wife was acting self centered to both you and the bride.", "NTA what the fuck is wrong with your wife?? She needed to budget for a fucking Uber (you can pre book them in most cities if you know you\u2019ll need one) or plan to have one drink at the wedding and drive or ask you to pick her up but asking you to come with as a setup is unacceptable.

And if she needed to drink she should have taken the Uber and the others could have too.", "NTA. You handled this in a classy and mature way. Your wife was rude and selfish for bringing you knowing you weren\u2019t invited. Venues are usually prepared to accommodate unexpected guests but it always comes at a cost to the hosts. You saved your wife\u2019s coworker some money by volunteering to leave and I\u2019m sure she was grateful to you for that. It was also considerate of you to leave the car behind so her coworkers could have the ride they were promised.

And in doing so, she also managed to stress the bride. She is the AH here, while you were more than accommodating all along.", "NTA. she clearly did not clear you coming with the bride and just wanted you as an excuse to get hammered. You did the polite thing to the bride (kudos to her for not throwing a tantrum over it and being cool) and made sure everyone had a safe way to get home. Your wife has only herself to blame", "NTA but your wife sure is.\n\n\nIt seems clear that not only you were not invited but that your wife just wanted a way for her and her coworkers to get home so they could get drunk.  \n\nI feel sorry for the bride being put in an awkward position at HER wedding.

I didn\u2019t know this!\n\nAgain she's TA. So she didn't even discuss things with you? Just drop it off on your head and leave you to handle things? \n\n> She was clearly furious at not being able to drink but couldn\u2019t really say anything and agreed. \n\nQuick question OP. If you didn't go with her, she would have been able to drive them to the wedding, just as she'd be able to drive them back, right? Clearly she tricked you into becoming DD just so she could drink to her heat's content \n\n> AITA\n\nNo, you are not. But your wife is", "NTA, but your wife sure is for bringing you when you were not invited. I assume she just wanted a DD, but she should have had a direct discussion with you about it all.", "NTA but your wife is a major one - it seems it was pretty clear that there no plus ones, but your wife decided to prioritize herself above everyone else, including the bride. If this is a regular issue where she\u2019s that selfish, then that\u2019s a problem.", "Nta. She didn't clear with the bride you were there. She set you up to drive everyone home without asking yet your still the ah? That doesn't work", "NTA but you definitely need to talk to your wife because every part of this is pretty bad. I think you know that, but see this as not her usual behavior and are confused but the only way to figure it out is talking to her\n\nGood luck!", "You are NOT the asshole! Invitations usually ask if a guest will bring a +1 or notify \"you and a guest\" or \"you +1\". If the invite didn't say that then it's probably fair to assume a +1 isn't welcomed. On the other hand, you know what they say about assuming (ASS out of yoU and ME). It is odd that spouses weren't invited. Next, it's the bride's call, not your wife's because it's the bride's special day she can pull the selfish card. Also, being auto DD is a little uncalled for especially if it wasn't discussed pre-handed. Dick move Mrs. Lastly, unless you work at night or plan on getting drunk at home, husbandly duties calls for being the wife's DD and ONLY the wife's DD. The rest are grown adults, they should be able to find a means of getting home safely.", "NTA but your wife is. First she brought a plus one which apparently was not in invite. Then she made you designated driver. Then when you graciously left and offered her reasonable alternatives she got mad. Did she really expect you to sit in a nearby bar and not drink? She owes you and the bride apologies. Also will be last time bride invites her.", "NTA, your wife on the other hand... So nice of her to lead you to believe you were an invited guest rather a dupe playing chauffeur, whilst putting the happy couple in the position of having an uninvited stranger in attendance.", "So your wife used you so she could get drunk? To do so, she brought you to the wedding even though you weren't invited? NTA.", "Ooof big NTA, who the hell invites a guest to a wedding if the invitation doesn't say +1? That must have been so embarrassing.", "NTA, you did the right thing, your wife on the other hand is TA in this :/", "Lol NTA - you did the polite thing and left when you realized that your wife had never actually received an invitation for you both. She is TA here.", "So wait...  Your wife invited you a wedding when she didn't have a plus one only so you could be her designated taxi driver???  Woah.  Obviously NTA.  Your wife on the other hand is living on another planet.", " NTA\u2026\u201dI\u2019m supposed to have fun, but you can\u2019t.  Sit here alone and be our chauffeur later.\u201d\n\nAlso who the heck doesn\u2019t let plus ones come to a wedding.  Especially if they are married?", "NTA, clearly there were no plus ones invited to the wedding.", "Info: is she always selfish?

You offered every solution under the sun, and it was if she wanted to make you as miserable as possible as none of them were good enough for her. What a selfish and inconsiderate woman!", "NTA.  You unintentionally crashed a wedding because your AH wife wanted a DD for the night for herself and her friends. that isn't okay...but it wasn't YOUR fault.", "She wanted you to wait for her in a bar because she didn't want to drink and drive?", "nta your wife is a piece of work", ">She was then concerned about availability late at night and also how the others were to get back- apparently I was to drop them off as well! \n\nSiunds like she make you go, even though she didn't have a plus one, so that she had a free taxi ride for her and her friends.", "> She was clearly furious at not being able to drink\n\nSounds like she's got a problem.  Was she drunk when she made this plan?", "NTA but your wife is A MASSIVE AH! She knew you weren't invited, brought you along anyway so she could get absolutley mortaled with her mates and get you to drive her and her friends home. She's pissed because the bride had the \"audacity\" to mention you weren't invited to her wedding and spoiling your wifes plans. She sounds like a conniving monster. Because she's not only put you in an awkward position, she's put her friends in awkward positions too with her failed plan.", "NTA.\n\nWhat on Earth was your wife thinking? It\u2019s clear she invited you without \u201cpermission\u201d b/c no other coworkers brought theirs SOs.\n\nBut I have to say I think it is weird AF to invite people who you know are married/in serious adult relationships and not allow them a plus one. The couple are kinda AH for this move too.", "NTA", "NTA get in her face and lay into her.", "NTA. Your wife made a huge faux pas. If she wanted a designated driver then she should had asked whether you were willing to pick her up and drop off all her coworkers instead of misleading you.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't invited, it put the bride in an awkward spot, you took the uber home and left your wife with a way home and SHE is the pissed off party in this scenario?", "NTA Honestly, I wouldn't know what I would have done in your place... perhaps took the car to a nearby caf\u00e8 and wait there until the ceremony ended and everyone was ready to go home. But that would have been incredibly unfair to you.\n\nIt is true you could have stayed, especially if the Bride truly didn't seem upset. It seems as if any choice you could have taken could be seen as the wrong one.", "NTA\n\nBut your wife sure stubborned herself out of a good wedding buzz!", "God I\u2019d be fuming at my SO for embarrassing me so I turned up to an event I wasn\u2019t invited to. NTA\n\nAlso she didn\u2019t misunderstand, she did this on purpose", "NTA but your wife is for putting you in that position. She new full well that you weren't invited.", "NTA\n\nHonestly,  if your wife doesn't come to her senses that she was being unreasonable, you need to take a long, hard look at your overall relationship. \n\nYour wife sounds like my ex. She would say we needed to compromise, which really just meant I had to agree with whatever she wanted to keep the peace.", "NTA - Her and her friends could split the cost of the Uber, assuming they all lived reasonably near each other. And if they don't live near each other, holy crap you were in for a long night driving everyone home.", "NTA Your wife took you as an uninvited plus one so that she could use you as her designated driver. She was extremely rude to you and the bride. She is the one who put herself in this situation and she has nothing to be upset about. She should apologize to you and the bride for her behavior.", "NTA. Your wife was incredibly rude both to the bride and to you. On the off chance that she doesn't know just how rude, since these were coworkers she is going to find out big time come Monday.\n\nHopefully she contemplated taking etiquette lessons during her designated driver evening at the reception. She needs them.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your wife didn't so much want you to join her for the party as much as she wanted a chauffeur.  I'm honestly surprised she didn't suggest that you just wait in the car. \n\nI don't know about you, but if I'm going to chauffeur someone I would expect to be paid for my time.", "Nta.  Basically,  she wanted to leverage the wedding as a drinking party with you as a designated driver.  She should have ensured you were invited first.  And, she wanted you to wait at a nearby bar but not drink...", "This story doesn\u2019t fully add up. So you were the DD, but you took an Uber home? And she is obviously drinking so you took a sober, expensive Uber home?", "NTA.\nthis was the type of shit my ex-wife used to pull on me, so I know how it feels mate. \nBeing pushed into something you don't want to do and then get laid into for not doing exactly what she wants.\nPut your foot down and don't tolerate this rubbish is my advice", "Sorry to break this to you, your wife knew SOs weren't invited, but brought you anyway and hoped the bride would be too polite to kick you out. She wanted you to chauffeur her around so she could have fun. That's why any attempt from you to compromise was received with anger.", "Judging from how the OP repeatedly says his wife misunderstood, he is either delusional or clueless.\n\nWife is a MAJOR AH.", "NTA, your wife is\n\nFirst of all, why would she ask you to go (never mind insist on it) when you weren\u2019t invited and her invite didn\u2019t include a plus one? If you\u2019re not invited you don\u2019t attend, it\u2019s that simple.\n\nSecondly, I will never understand why people insist on bringing other people to things they don\u2019t want to go to. I\u2019m single, but if I were to go to a wedding I would ask my partner if they want to go and if they say no then that\u2019s the end of it and I go by myself, why is this so hard for so many people? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s enjoyable being around others who clearly would rather be somewhere else. There was nothing to gain for anyone by you being there, only inconvenience for you and the newly wedded couple, and awkwardness for her friends who don\u2019t know you. \n\nThirdly, the bride (and groom but he wasn\u2019t mentioned) gets to decide what happens during their own wedding. You and the bride agreed that you would leave, it\u2019s simply not your wife\u2019s decision to make and I find it ridiculous that she would still insist on you staying, causing inconvenience to the person you\u2019re all there for in the first place.\n\nI find it hilarious that she thinks you deliberately ruined her night when you didn\u2019t even want to be involved in the first place and you\u2019re just looking out for the bride. Also does she not think she\u2019s trying to ruin your night? I mean she wants you to just sit in a bar, sober, waiting for her so you can bring her home and then give her friends a lift without telling you upfront? I\u2019m not sure how she didn\u2019t feel silly saying that out loud\n\nWith that all being said I think you\u2019ve learned a lesson here. Next time your wife leans on you to go somewhere you don\u2019t want to go, say no and don\u2019t give in.", "NTA. Your wife is the huge AH here. She brought an uninvited plus-one just so she could have a free ride home. Very cringy and she should be embarrassed.", "Dude, she DID NOT misunderstand!!! She\u2019s just an AH!", "Dude, she DID NOT misunderstand!!! She\u2019s just an AH!!!!!!", "NTA but your wife will probably always think u are and even more of an A that you posted this on reddit. ahh wifes\u2026 cant live with them, can live without em. \ud83d\ude02", "Actually no, but the bride is a bit of one.  I mean when you invite people to your wedding who are married it sort of assumes that the spouse would be invited too.  This is weird.  I have been dragged to a number of weddings via my wife and every invitation was always for the 2 of us.  Only inviting one spouse is a poor move.\n\nEdited:  to all those who have visceral reaction to my comment about the bride, well when we have gotten invited it was always husband and wife, plus one invites were for unmarried people.

So I made the decision to take it", "Tbf she\u2019s ok normally.", "Maybe. Quite common though.", "Not an asshole for asking.\n\nAn asshole for trying to shame me into it though.\n\nIt's the whole \"deliberately ruined her night\" the problem.", "What if the situation was completely different? Well what if the moon was made of cheese?", "But he wasn't invited. None of the other Co workers brought a guest so the invite didn't say \"plus one\". Not sure what happened there. The bride was relieved that she didn't have to scramble to find a seat and meal. It's a good thing OP left. Had OP's wife gotten an Uber she could still drink just not get blackout drunk. Getting more than tipsy around coworkers isn't a great idea anyway.", "I don't think it was an elaborate plan. I just think the wife was a bit selfish. It seems like all of her plans revolved around drinking, to the point where she lacked communication at various points. Going to weddings sober isn't the most fun, but my partner not having to sit alone for hours would be more important to me personally.", "If you're expecting your spouse to provide services to their detriment, you are an AH.", "It\u2019s weird that she hadn\u2019t discussed the +1 situation with these people ahead of time given that they are close enough to be going to the wedding.", "But understanding something is. If they all knew, there\u2019s a reasonable expectation that she would. Besides, it\u2019s really hard to fuck this up. Was his name on the invitation? Was there an explicit plus one? Clearly not. Maybe it\u2019s the misunderstanding of a young person who assumes married couples are units, but even that feels like a stretch.", "\n>I would not for a second think someone would be rude enough to invite me to their wedding and not extend that invitation to my spouse.\n\nSee, this is a little different because this is a coworker invite, and not a friends or family invite. The coworker is not close enough to the wife to know the husband, so I would not expect an invite.", "Our wedding was quite low key.", "SUSPICIOUSLY reasonable, if you ask me...", "Oops. My mistake!! Ha!", "And that's without mentioning the whole story with the horse boner.\n\nWild stuff.", "Damn - I gotta keep remembering to check post history!!! Thanks for heads up.", "The most bizarre thing, of all the weirdness here, is for her to then be angry at you that you're not hanging around either uninvited at the wedding or staying nearby for the duration of the event solely as a chauffeur so that she and her coworkers can all get wrecked.  \n\nThis is red flaggy and awkward to say the least - NTA and I might be asking myself if there's either a real issue with self centeredness and lack of empathy, or an alcohol problem here, or both.  The fact that she brought you along without an invite to chauffeur her drunken coworkers without asking is egregiously rude to both you and the bride - for her to turn around and be mad at you here is over the top.", "I think you are also trying to convince yourself. She knew and was trying to sneak you in. She would have been as embarrassed as you were if she had made the mistake.", "As somebody who was in a relationship like yours please stop doing that.", "Maybe show her this after a conversation.", "Sounds like his wife is a bit of an alcoholic. If the only way to enjoy an event you're looking forward to is by drinking copious amounts of alcohol, you likely have a problem with alcohol.", "Alcoholism is very common.", "I can see why that would be a line you shouldn't approach/let alone cross.\n\nEspecially when she nearly ruined the entire wedding.\n\nAbsolutely not a thing you make a bride worry about.", "We are just talking and exploring the subject, no need to get all edgy.", "Wife fucked up is what happened here. Thats indisputable. But people do fuck up from time to time, and honestly I think you have a duty to be there for your spouse when they do fuck up.", "Fair. My partner not getting to have a fun night with their friends is more important to me. Especially if all it costs me is a dull evening.", "She definitely would of to know who needed a lift home because they would be there alone and wanted to drink.", "i'm confused about how these other guests were apparently told her +1 would be the designated driver yet ppl were confused and murmuring at the wedding when he was there? and wouldn't there have been already talk about why she got a +1 who would drive them home, when no one else had their SO there?", "Also, she's married so should have a general understanding of how wedding invites work, especially due to costs, and if there is a question if someone is invited or not, that should be cleared up right away instead of assuming", "But one of you sent invitations and were ready for a particular number of guests? Or she's been invited to weddings and knows what invitations look like?", "\ud83e\udd23 I somehow missed that. My reddit is acting crazy right now. Do I even want to look...", "Nah she\u2019s just selfish. She could\u2019ve booked an Uber and rocked up home wasted - nothing necessarily wrong with a friends\u2019 night out. Getting drunk at a wedding is fine - making your hubby the Uber alternative is not.", "Yeah.\n\nBut I didn't answer your question. I guess it would depend on the situation. \n\nHow far am I from home? Is there an actual bar that is not too shady around? Is it for 2 or 6 hours? How bad are taxi in my area?\n\nBut I think my girlfriend would just call a cab and not ask me to wait for her for hours alone in a bar.", "I'd argue that she didn't fuck up. It's pretty common knowledge that you can only bring another person to a wedding if they're on the invite or if the invite says plus one.\n\nIt's rude, inconsiderate, and can fuck up numbers for things like venue capacity and catering.\n\nThe wife was being selfish. She wanted to get drunk so she needed someone to give her a ride home. Note that none of the people she also volunteered to have her husband give a ride home to brought a plus one, probably because it's common knowledge not to unless the invite states otherwise.\n\nShe's not pissed because she misunderstood the invite, she's pissed because she thought she could sneak him in and because it ruined her plans to get drunk with her friends and have him act as designated driver.", "would have had *", "My rando guess is she told everyone she was going to sneak him in to DD, and they didn\u2019t believe she\u2019d actually do it and were surprised when he showed up.", "I think he was just DD for her, not for everyone.", "Just messing with you.", "If there's things that make the plan infeasible thats totally different.\n\nBut if the idea is all OP has to go do is go play on their phone for some time, I'm sorry its AH to just refuse that.", "Aight.\n\nWhat if that was the ask. \"Spouse, I want to go to this wedding and get drunk. You know I'm not comfortable with rideshares. Please do this for me.\"\n\nAre you really saying its not AH for a spouse to say \"naw, I don't want to be bored for a couple of hours\"?", "Or she just said her husband would drive them home and they assumed he was driving there to pick her up and would bring them home on the way", "your interpretation is far more generous than mine, my hunch was that OP is another wedding troll and didn't think their post through lmao", "He says in the post he was supposed to drive them all back. that's why the wife was mad when he said to take an uber", "\ud83d\udc80\ud83e\udd23", "Well it depends. One hour? sure. two? I mean alright I'll get a good snack. 6? I might start flirting with the barmaid...", "Btw, what about you? Ready to take one for the team while your boyfriend smash his face with the homies at the game while you wait in the parking lot?\n\n\"Oops sorry hon, I got no tickets for you, mind waiting here for us and not ruin our fun\"?", "No, that's not the asshole bit. The asshole bit was dragging him to a wedding that he was not invited to, making him uncomfortable and the bride anxious, without telling him that there wasn't a plus one on the invite, expecting him to find a random bar and wait for her to be ready after he agreed to leave the wedding that he was not invited to, to sit and wait until she was ready.\n\nWhen he refused to do that, she then sprung on him that her friends also needed rides home and she had said he would drive them. Then making a scene and acting as if everything that happened was his fault.", "Oh is that a thing?  Do wedding posts get better traction?", "it's definitely a thing to have certain themed posts. i know that cuz i spend too much time here lol. OP's post history is kinda sus too, like who goes to a wedding of their ex and asks if she's gotten a boob job?"]}
