The bride didn't want you there like you mentioned. It sounds like your wife was acting self centered to both you and the bride.", "NTA what the fuck is wrong with your wife?? She needed to budget for a fucking Uber (you can pre book them in most cities if you know you\u2019ll need one) or plan to have one drink at the wedding and drive or ask you to pick her up but asking you to come with as a setup is unacceptable.

And if she needed to drink she should have taken the Uber and the others could have too.", "NTA. You handled this in a classy and mature way. Your wife was rude and selfish for bringing you knowing you weren\u2019t invited. Venues are usually prepared to accommodate unexpected guests but it always comes at a cost to the hosts. You saved your wife\u2019s coworker some money by volunteering to leave and I\u2019m sure she was grateful to you for that.

Just drop it off on your head and leave you to handle things? \n\n> She was clearly furious at not being able to drink but couldn\u2019t really say anything and agreed. \n\nQuick question OP. If you didn't go with her, she would have been able to drive them to the wedding, just as she'd be able to drive them back, right? Clearly she tricked you into becoming DD just so she could drink to her heat's content \n\n> AITA\n\nNo, you are not. But your wife is", "NTA, but your wife sure is for bringing you when you were not invited. I assume she just wanted a DD, but she should have had a direct discussion with you about it all.", "NTA but your wife is a major one - it seems it was pretty clear that there no plus ones, but your wife decided to prioritize herself above everyone else, including the bride. If this is a regular issue where she\u2019s that selfish, then that\u2019s a problem.", "Nta. She didn't clear with the bride you were there. She set you up to drive everyone home without asking yet your still the ah? That doesn't work", "NTA but you definitely need to talk to your wife because every part of this is pretty bad. I think you know that, but see this as not her usual behavior and are confused but the only way to figure it out is talking to her\n\nGood luck!", "You are NOT the asshole! Invitations usually ask if a guest will bring a +1 or notify \"you and a guest\" or \"you +1\". If the invite didn't say that then it's probably fair to assume a +1 isn't welcomed. On the other hand, you know what they say about assuming (ASS out of yoU and ME). It is odd that spouses weren't invited. Next, it's the bride's call, not your wife's because it's the bride's special day she can pull the selfish card. Also, being auto DD is a little uncalled for especially if it wasn't discussed pre-handed. Dick move Mrs. Lastly, unless you work at night or plan on getting drunk at home, husbandly duties calls for being the wife's DD and ONLY the wife's DD. The rest are grown adults, they should be able to find a means of getting home safely.", "NTA but your wife is. First she brought a plus one which apparently was not in invite. Then she made you designated driver. Then when you graciously left and offered her reasonable alternatives she got mad. Did she really expect you to sit in a nearby bar and not drink? She owes you and the bride apologies. Also will be last time bride invites her.", "NTA, your wife on the other hand... So nice of her to lead you to believe you were an invited guest rather a dupe playing chauffeur, whilst putting the happy couple in the position of having an uninvited stranger in attendance.", "So your wife used you so she could get drunk? To do so, she brought you to the wedding even though you weren't invited? NTA.", "Ooof big NTA, who the hell invites a guest to a wedding if the invitation doesn't say +1? That must have been so embarrassing.", "NTA, you did the right thing, your wife on the other hand is TA in this :/", "Lol NTA - you did the polite thing and left when you realized that your wife had never actually received an invitation for you both. She is TA here.", "So wait...  Your wife invited you a wedding when she didn't have a plus one only so you could be her designated taxi driver???  Woah.  Obviously NTA.  Your wife on the other hand is living on another planet.", " NTA\u2026\u201dI\u2019m supposed to have fun, but you can\u2019t.

Especially if they are married?", "NTA, clearly there were no plus ones invited to the wedding.", "Info: is she always selfish?

You offered every solution under the sun, and it was if she wanted to make you as miserable as possible as none of them were good enough for her. What a selfish and inconsiderate woman!", "NTA.  You unintentionally crashed a wedding because your AH wife wanted a DD for the night for herself and her friends. that isn't okay...but it wasn't YOUR fault.", "She wanted you to wait for her in a bar because she didn't want to drink and drive?", "nta your wife is a piece of work", ">She was then concerned about availability late at night and also how the others were to get back- apparently I was to drop them off as well! \n\nSiunds like she make you go, even though she didn't have a plus one, so that she had a free taxi ride for her and her friends.", "> She was clearly furious at not being able to drink\n\nSounds like she's got a problem.  Was she drunk when she made this plan?", "NTA but your wife is A MASSIVE AH! She knew you weren't invited, brought you along anyway so she could get absolutley mortaled with her mates and get you to drive her and her friends home. She's pissed because the bride had the \"audacity\" to mention you weren't invited to her wedding and spoiling your wifes plans. She sounds like a conniving monster. Because she's not only put you in an awkward position, she's put her friends in awkward positions too with her failed plan.", "NTA.\n\nWhat on Earth was your wife thinking? It\u2019s clear she invited you without \u201cpermission\u201d b/c no other coworkers brought theirs SOs.\n\nBut I have to say I think it is weird AF to invite people who you know are married/in serious adult relationships and not allow them a plus one. The couple are kinda AH for this move too.", "NTA", "NTA get in her face and lay into her.", "NTA. Your wife made a huge faux pas. If she wanted a designated driver then she should had asked whether you were willing to pick her up and drop off all her coworkers instead of misleading you.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't invited, it put the bride in an awkward spot, you took the uber home and left your wife with a way home and SHE is the pissed off party in this scenario?", "NTA Honestly, I wouldn't know what I would have done in your place... perhaps took the car to a nearby caf\u00e8 and wait there until the ceremony ended and everyone was ready to go home. But that would have been incredibly unfair to you.\n\nIt is true you could have stayed, especially if the Bride truly didn't seem upset. It seems as if any choice you could have taken could be seen as the wrong one.", "NTA\n\nBut your wife sure stubborned herself out of a good wedding buzz!", "God I\u2019d be fuming at my SO for embarrassing me so I turned up to an event I wasn\u2019t invited to. NTA\n\nAlso she didn\u2019t misunderstand, she did this on purpose", "NTA but your wife is for putting you in that position. She new full well that you weren't invited.", "NTA\n\nHonestly,  if your wife doesn't come to her senses that she was being unreasonable, you need to take a long, hard look at your overall relationship. \n\nYour wife sounds like my ex. She would say we needed to compromise, which really just meant I had to agree with whatever she wanted to keep the peace.", "NTA - Her and her friends could split the cost of the Uber, assuming they all lived reasonably near each other. And if they don't live near each other, holy crap you were in for a long night driving everyone home.", "NTA Your wife took you as an uninvited plus one so that she could use you as her designated driver. She was extremely rude to you and the bride. She is the one who put herself in this situation and she has nothing to be upset about. She should apologize to you and the bride for her behavior.", "NTA. Your wife was incredibly rude both to the bride and to you. On the off chance that she doesn't know just how rude, since these were coworkers she is going to find out big time come Monday.\n\nHopefully she contemplated taking etiquette lessons during her designated driver evening at the reception. She needs them.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your wife didn't so much want you to join her for the party as much as she wanted a chauffeur.  I'm honestly surprised she didn't suggest that you just wait in the car. \n\nI don't know about you, but if I'm going to chauffeur someone I would expect to be paid for my time.", "Nta.  Basically,  she wanted to leverage the wedding as a drinking party with you as a designated driver.  She should have ensured you were invited first.  And, she wanted you to wait at a nearby bar but not drink...", "This story doesn\u2019t fully add up. So you were the DD, but you took an Uber home? And she is obviously drinking so you took a sober, expensive Uber home?", "NTA.\nthis was the type of shit my ex-wife used to pull on me, so I know how it feels mate. \nBeing pushed into something you don't want to do and then get laid into for not doing exactly what she wants.\nPut your foot down and don't tolerate this rubbish is my advice", "Sorry to break this to you, your wife knew SOs weren't invited, but brought you anyway and hoped the bride would be too polite to kick you out. She wanted you to chauffeur her around so she could have fun. That's why any attempt from you to compromise was received with anger.", "Judging from how the OP repeatedly says his wife misunderstood, he is either delusional or clueless.\n\nWife is a MAJOR AH.", "NTA, your wife is\n\nFirst of all, why would she ask you to go (never mind insist on it) when you weren\u2019t invited and her invite didn\u2019t include a plus one? If you\u2019re not invited you don\u2019t attend, it\u2019s that simple.\n\nSecondly, I will never understand why people insist on bringing other people to things they don\u2019t want to go to. I\u2019m single, but if I were to go to a wedding I would ask my partner if they want to go and if they say no then that\u2019s the end of it and I go by myself, why is this so hard for so many people? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s enjoyable being around others who clearly would rather be somewhere else. There was nothing to gain for anyone by you being there, only inconvenience for you and the newly wedded couple, and awkwardness for her friends who don\u2019t know you. \n\nThirdly, the bride (and groom but he wasn\u2019t mentioned) gets to decide what happens during their own wedding. You and the bride agreed that you would leave, it\u2019s simply not your wife\u2019s decision to make and I find it ridiculous that she would still insist on you staying, causing inconvenience to the person you\u2019re all there for in the first place.\n\nI find it hilarious that she thinks you deliberately ruined her night when you didn\u2019t even want to be involved in the first place and you\u2019re just looking out for the bride. Also does she not think she\u2019s trying to ruin your night? I mean she wants you to just sit in a bar, sober, waiting for her so you can bring her home and then give her friends a lift without telling you upfront? I\u2019m not sure how she didn\u2019t feel silly saying that out loud\n\nWith that all being said I think you\u2019ve learned a lesson here. Next time your wife leans on you to go somewhere you don\u2019t want to go, say no and don\u2019t give in.", "NTA. Your wife is the huge AH here. She brought an uninvited plus-one just so she could have a free ride home. Very cringy and she should be embarrassed.", "Dude, she DID NOT misunderstand!!! She\u2019s just an AH!", "Dude, she DID NOT misunderstand!!! She\u2019s just an AH!!!!!!", "NTA but your wife will probably always think u are and even more of an A that you posted this on reddit. ahh wifes\u2026 cant live with them, can live without em. \ud83d\ude02", "Actually no, but the bride is a bit of one.  I mean when you invite people to your wedding who are married it sort of assumes that the spouse would be invited too.  This is weird.  I have been dragged to a number of weddings via my wife and every invitation was always for the 2 of us.  Only inviting one spouse is a poor move.\n\nEdited:  to all those who have visceral reaction to my comment about the bride, well when we have gotten invited it was always husband and wife, plus one invites were for unmarried people.

I worked a wedding last week that had 250 show up for 200 planned.", "I was being cheeky.", "Or she didn't tell them beforehand, but intended to when she got there -- \"Hey everyone, this is Joe, and he's agreed to be our DD.\" And genuinely didn't know that other people weren't bringing spouses.", "Thank you!!!", "That sounds more organisers than the guests.", "Yeah, but that\u2019s less fun to imagine.", "It says others were expecting a ride.", "It was both.  They were trying to pay less.  It was also a Mexican wedding, and there are some cultural differences regarding RSVPing.
