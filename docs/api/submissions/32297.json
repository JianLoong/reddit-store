It's selfish of her to expect you to put up with a newborn in your house, she's taking advantage of your kindness.

You\u2019re extremely generous for letting your niece live with you as it is. But expecting you to also live with a newborn is taking advantage of your kindness.

It is your house. You have a right to enjoy your time off without having to hear a crying baby. Why isn't she living with her baby daddy?

That would be faulty reasoning.", "Cold as it sounds, I\u2019d work on getting her out of your house sooner than later.

You\u2019ve shown her generosity and kindness but that\u2019s not an open door. I\u2019m guessing she hasn\u2019t moved in with bf yet because you offer a more pleasing housing situation. She isn\u2019t moving in with bf now? She\u2019s calling you an AH because her plans are ruined; either she is hoping she\u2019ll give you more support, she wants to get bf to move in, or both.

Good luck!", "NTA- You're collateral damage in a failed 'baby trap'- she thought if she got pregnant that would cause the BF to instantly create the stable home she's always wanted with her, and he's not ready for kids and freaked.", "oh my, how quickly they turn... all sweetness and light while she's taking but little miss nasty when you pull it back.   by giving her a stable place to stay you allowed her to address her problems and she's steady on her feet now.  you're absolutely correct that she needs to make arrangements to move in with the father of her child, who should be the providing the home and monetary support.  you've been very good to her and you most definitely do not need to give up your entire home and quiet existence for her new little project.  she needs to learn that having a baby means that she's all grown up now and her family is her baby and her baby daddy.  make sure you give her a time limit to move out so she doesn't drag it on and on and you have to deliver the baby yourself.  hopefully at some point in the future she'll be more appreciative of all that you've done for her.\n\nNTA", "NTA & she was really out of line. You have gone out of your way for her & the suggestion that she move in with The Impregnator was absolutely reasonable. \nIf she doesn\u2019t want to live with him, should she be having his baby? Either way, you\u2019re definitely NTA, your niece is lucky to have you.", "Not the AH. Newborns are obnoxious and loud.

He just stopped up the toilet with a toy, so now a plumber is needed AGAIN.  What you THINK you'll have to deal with (if she stays with the baby) is nothing compared to what will actually happen. What about the cost of child care? And be sure that her BF will practically move in.", "Where are her parents?  Also if you\u2019re gonna do adult things, you need to be prepared to handle the adult responsibilities and outcome.  It\u2019s not up to others to bail you out.

After giving birth she will need someone help her with baby I think you will help her this time too.", "NTA. Take steps now to evict her so she is gone well before the baby is born. Although she has been living there rent free you may still have to go through legal proceedings. Put everything in writing.", "NTA. This baby is the responsibility of its mother and father, not you. She is lucky you gave her a safe place to live when she needed it. You told her now that she will have to move instead of waiting until closer to the birth or after so she has time to make plans. Stick to your guns on this one or you will end up very resentful.", "NTA. She is 25 having a baby.

You can get a social worker to work with her to find a place, etc.", "Nta.  You never agreed to care for a newborn.  She clearly knows you live quietly and value the peace.

Newborns are rough. It's your home, and you get to choose what goes on in it.", "NTA\n\nLiving with a newborn is hectic and I totally understand why you don't want to take that on.

Why have a baby with someone she doesn\u2019t see as a good partner to live with and raise a baby with?", "NTA, she's going threw alot of hormonal changes now that she's pregnant and she probably just lashed out due to the hormones.

NTA it's not your responsibility to accept a child out of nowhere, especially when there is a father to sort out their life with. \n\n2. I will say, however, for so many comments about \"she's an adult she should be on her own blahblehblah\" - we need to really dissect what you're saying there. The overwhelming majority of adults under 35 are struggling in a world that rejects recognition of them and jobs want 20 years of experience to pay you barely above minimum expectations. There are quite literally job listings for 10 years experience with a development language that has only existed for 6 years. Be fair, someone else's life situation is not black and white as a lot of you are making it. \n\n3. It may be helpful to offer her resources that can help her get into a better situation going forward. Be clear that you're unable to provide for her and an infant, but there are plenty of state resources available in most places! She should look to sign up for Medicaid if she doesn't have a reliable insurance at the moment. She can apply as two people because they will count the unborn child. She can also begin now wait listing herself for income restricted housing if that is an issue she is facing. Nutrition assistance can be available to her as well. She has options, but she might not know exactly what they are without guidance and help to know what to look for. It's all quite overwhelming. \n\n4. Keep in mind her reactions may not be fair right now. Pregnancy, especially the first trimester, is an exceptionally emotional time. Hormones are changing drastically every day and it's unironically more exhausting in the first trimester than the last in my experience. Have patience even when standing your ground. Remind her that she does matter to you and you don't want to see her fail, but you're simply not the place for a child. You're not an asshole at all, but I would give her some patience with the emotional reactions. \ud83c\udf39 \n\n5. This is all said with absolutely no intricate understanding of her situation, please take me with a grain of salt if it doesn't all fit. Good luck to you and your family though. I hope that even though you're not fit to live with an infant, you get immense joy from her visiting after munchkin is born \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\u2728 !", "Golly, people are assuming a lot of awful things about your niece.

She may be upset and you can ask her why or try to communicate with her why she is. Hear her out (even if why she is upset isn\u2019t truly reasonable request - like wanting to stay in your home). I think coming from the stance of wanting to be supportive and maybe even helping her find a place will show more positive response than just \u201chey I don\u2019t want you living here\u201d.
