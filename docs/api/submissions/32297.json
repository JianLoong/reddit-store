It's selfish of her to expect you to put up with a newborn in your house, she's taking advantage of your kindness.

You\u2019re extremely generous for letting your niece live with you as it is. But expecting you to also live with a newborn is taking advantage of your kindness.

It is your house. You have a right to enjoy your time off without having to hear a crying baby. Why isn't she living with her baby daddy?

She probably has tenant rights.", "Nope, NTA. She changed the conditions under which she would be living with you, you did not.", "NTA. Dear Lawd, where would this girl be if you hadn\u2019t allowed her to move in? She sounds a bit entitled. Why isn\u2019t she living with her bf?", "NTA. Your niece is an adult.

That would be faulty reasoning.", "Cold as it sounds, I\u2019d work on getting her out of your house sooner than later.

You\u2019ve shown her generosity and kindness but that\u2019s not an open door. I\u2019m guessing she hasn\u2019t moved in with bf yet because you offer a more pleasing housing situation. She isn\u2019t moving in with bf now? She\u2019s calling you an AH because her plans are ruined; either she is hoping she\u2019ll give you more support, she wants to get bf to move in, or both.

Good luck!", "NTA- You're collateral damage in a failed 'baby trap'- she thought if she got pregnant that would cause the BF to instantly create the stable home she's always wanted with her, and he's not ready for kids and freaked.", "oh my, how quickly they turn... all sweetness and light while she's taking but little miss nasty when you pull it back.   by giving her a stable place to stay you allowed her to address her problems and she's steady on her feet now.  you're absolutely correct that she needs to make arrangements to move in with the father of her child, who should be the providing the home and monetary support.  you've been very good to her and you most definitely do not need to give up your entire home and quiet existence for her new little project.  she needs to learn that having a baby means that she's all grown up now and her family is her baby and her baby daddy.  make sure you give her a time limit to move out so she doesn't drag it on and on and you have to deliver the baby yourself.  hopefully at some point in the future she'll be more appreciative of all that you've done for her.\n\nNTA", "NTA & she was really out of line. You have gone out of your way for her & the suggestion that she move in with The Impregnator was absolutely reasonable. \nIf she doesn\u2019t want to live with him, should she be having his baby? Either way, you\u2019re definitely NTA, your niece is lucky to have you.", "Not the AH. Newborns are obnoxious and loud.

He just stopped up the toilet with a toy, so now a plumber is needed AGAIN.  What you THINK you'll have to deal with (if she stays with the baby) is nothing compared to what will actually happen. What about the cost of child care? And be sure that her BF will practically move in.", "Where are her parents?  Also if you\u2019re gonna do adult things, you need to be prepared to handle the adult responsibilities and outcome.  It\u2019s not up to others to bail you out.

After giving birth she will need someone help her with baby I think you will help her this time too.", "NTA. Take steps now to evict her so she is gone well before the baby is born. Although she has been living there rent free you may still have to go through legal proceedings. Put everything in writing.", "NTA. This baby is the responsibility of its mother and father, not you. She is lucky you gave her a safe place to live when she needed it. You told her now that she will have to move instead of waiting until closer to the birth or after so she has time to make plans. Stick to your guns on this one or you will end up very resentful.", "NTA. She is 25 having a baby. She should be grateful with the time that you\u2019ve given her to get her ducks in a row by living with you.

You can get a social worker to work with her to find a place, etc.", "Nta.  You never agreed to care for a newborn.  She clearly knows you live quietly and value the peace.

Newborns are rough. It's your home, and you get to choose what goes on in it.", "NTA\n\nLiving with a newborn is hectic and I totally understand why you don't want to take that on.

Why have a baby with someone she doesn\u2019t see as a good partner to live with and raise a baby with?", "NTA, she's going threw alot of hormonal changes now that she's pregnant and she probably just lashed out due to the hormones.

I bet she thought the BF would be allowed to move in next! \n\nNTA, should also look into what steps you have to take to kick her out if she doesn\u2019t go willingly", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46", ">Why isn't she living with her baby daddy?\n\nI'm wondering if the baby daddy is in another relationship that was well underway when he got involved with OP's niece. This wouldn't be the first time something like this has happened.", "Ew no. \u201cCrisis pregnancy centers\u201d and their related \u201cservices\u201d are predatory and creepy asf. Don\u2019t refer anyone to one of these fake clinics. \n\nAny \u201chealth care\u201d they offer is sketch asf and many times they get around medical regulations by having people \u2018volunteer\u2019 to do ultrasounds etc. so you could get some zealous RN fresh off a shift at a proper hospital, or it could be some zealous rando who \u2018volunteered\u2019 to perform ultrasounds- no f\u2019n thank you! \n\nIt\u2019s chilling that some of these forced-birth corporations are now trying to push their \u201cunwed mothers\u201d home thing (like it\u2019s 1959 fr) in addition to the fake health care of forced birth pregnancy centers. Prob have a direct line to Georgia Tan adoption brokers. BOOoOooooooo! \n\nAs far as putting their money where their mouth is, if you mean contributing to anti-abortion extremists who want us to have literally no rights at all and will stop at nothing til we get there, yeah, I guess you\u2019re right \n\nThis is a huge no. Ew ew ew never.", "I absolutely disagree. She needs to know now that if she has this baby she will be homeless. The earlier it is in the pregnancy, the easier it is for her to get an abortion if she choses. It would be cruel to let her think she has a place to live to raise this child and let the time lapse that it is easier to terminate a pregnancy.", "What a stupid comment.", "Ugh...", "I think if i was younger, i would too, and i did...i let my sister move in with me when i was in my 20s and she and her guy got into a similar situation...but that was 30 years ago.", ">if we are expected to read between the lines: \"AITA for suggesting my live-in niece have an abortion because I can't stand newborns?\"\n\nThis is far-fetched and unfair. OP never even hinted towards that.", "Thats a good point... i didnt even think about suggesting that she should do that to continue living at my place... but now that you have made me think about that, i would never suggest that ,because i do not believe its my place to do so...", "Good old family. You try to help them out and they screw you over by making more irresponsible choices and then try to blame their predicament on you.", "She took advantage of your generosity and instead of making plans to stand on her own 2 feet , she decides to have a boyfriend and get pregnant. And doesn\u2019t want to move in with that guy. Is he a deadbeat ? Was she planning on staying with you forever and inheriting your house after you were gone ? This should have been a temporary arrangement.", "Adding to what the previous person said...Your niece cannot even look after herself, how is she going to look after a needy and clingy baby?\n\nAs much as want to say \"her body, her choice\", choices come with responsibilities and consequences. Since they are \"her choices\" they are \"her responsibilities\" and \"her consequences\".\n\nNTA for setting your boundaries, you already did her a huge favour by letting her stay with you but even \"family favours\" have limits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd honestly question why she would want a baby with a man that she doesn't want to live with. if they are serious and \"mature\" enough to have a baby together then they should be serious and committed enough to live together. \n\nI REALLY REALLY hope she wasn't expecting you to allow the baby daddy to move in with you too, so she could play family in your home..... (There have been CRAZY stories on this sub of pregnant couples trying to kick people out of their own homes)", "NTA.  She's an adult. You're not responsible for her or her living situation.  You're definitely not responsible for her child.  It's your house so your rules.", "> and called me an AH\n\n\"How dare you put a roof over my head for years, provide me stability, and look out for me when no one else would!!  You're such an asshole!!\"  NTA.  She's old enough to sort out her own life.", "What on earth did she think was going to happen here? That she'd moved in for life? That the bf would join her? That you'd be supporting her child, and the children?\n\nDefinitely NTA, and the very fact that she called you one after all you've done means she's actually learned nothing and is ungrateful. Time for her to move on. She's 25. Sheesh.", "NTA. She seems pretty entitled thinking you would continue to support her and her baby.", "She's going to ask you to let her bf move in. LoL. She's planning to start a family and retire in your home. You are their babysitter.", "I swear, there should be a ChatGTP 5 maturity/security/solvency test before being allowed to have unprotected sex. It's like some girl decides \"me and my descendants will decline into poverty\". Babies are best with two married parents, mental health, some reasonable financial security and a lot of maturity.\n\nDid she think you'll raise a kid for 20 years for yucks? Probably was planning for the BF to move in too. Abort mission.", "I would almost bet the wife of her boyfriend would have something to say about it because of her reaction.", "So you are just gonna set back and wait for her to talk again? And if she doesn\u2019t?", "Exactly this.", "Yep that\u2019s what I am wondering as well. Like he can\u2019t because he is married or entangled with someone else.", "Looks like history is repeating itself.", "Yep and that makes sense to me. I definitely don't think you're an asshole for your decision. So please don't think that just because I think I would make a different one that it in any way speaks judgment upon you.\n\nI would just say to keep an eye on the situation and if it truly starts looking like they might end up on the street or in a shelter to reconsider. The system will fail them because it's sadly only built to look like it exists and not really help anyone who truly needs help.", "You're right. That wasn't fair. I'm struggling with the thought of a 24 y.o. homeless mother of a newborn.", "The mistake was making the conversation about how it impacted you. Your discomfort, your complaints, your inconvenience. \n\nAfter sharing in her excitement, you might have suggested that she deserves her own home for her budding family. Then, begin to discuss how and when she might be able to get her own place.\n\nThe way it went down, it's will feel very much like she and her child are unwelcome. Put yourself in her pregnant shoes, and you can understand how terrifying that could be.", "\u201cDecides to get pregnant\u201d is a big assumption. Did she mean to? Did she have funds and access to birth control? Was she consenting in the situation? Did a condom break? Does she have safe and legal access to abortion should she wish to choose that option? (My guess is probably not).\n\nYes, she may have intended to, she also may not have intended to get pregnant. And if it wasn\u2019t intentional and she doesn\u2019t have access to an abortion, then it sounds like the one person who she felt she could trust said she would have to move out\u2026instead of being curious and asking her how it all happened and if she has an idea of how she\u2019d like to proceed.\n\nI\u2019m not at all saying the OP is the asshole, just pointing out that the OP and no one else here know the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy. People on Reddit are so quick to assume, \u201cshitty woman got pregnant on purpose\u201d it\u2019s just ridiculous.", "I wonder if he is married or in a relationship and that\u2019s why they can\u2019t live together?", "Did you hurt you back making that reach?", "It's one possibility. Certainly not the only. \n\nI would assume that a bf who impregnates his gf is already living with her.\n\nHowever, that isn't the case here, and it seems suspicious.", "She's 24 hardly  a child.  She could have used contraception. She has no right to assume living arrangements in a place that is not hers. Somebody helped her get pregnant,  he can help her figure it out", "She doesn't have to be homeless. She has a bf who I assume is the father of the child. He is supposed to be the one supporting her, not OP.", "A 24 year old is not a baby. Having a baby at 24 was the choice of an adult. And every action of yours has consequences. She should put her priorities, maybe her own roof before she decides that I can have my baby under someone else's roof.", "Is it hard to read these comments from way up there on your high horse?", "Why should OPat his age suddenly have his life disrupted by a baby. He was already putting himself out for her. You have no idea of the size of the house, or the sound proofness. \nShe's old enough to have sex with no contraception. Her and the partner are now responsible not OP.", "OP is still NTA\n\nOP already did a kindness by taking her in when her home life was chaotic and unstable. SHE was the child OP took responsibility for when he didn't need to. He is already taking care of a child that isn't his. \n\nMaybe she should've been more responsible before getting pregnant when she didn't even have her own place. \n\nNiece and her BF should actively be trying to live together now that they are expecting, this is 100% none of OPs responsibility.", "The child is unwelcome. OMG, OP does not want to raise a baby. He was nice to help the niece out. She is incredibly irresponsible to think she can just bring a baby into his house too. Good lord people are freaking entitled.", "That still doesn't make him the A H. Whether he's comfortable living with a newborn is very much about OP. He was honest. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nOP, you should talk to your niece about how you'd be willing to help her and BF find a place to live, but you can't help out full time with a newborn and that's what would happen if they both lived with you.", "Whoa.. disagree with this thought process. OP has put forth something straightforward here, let\u2019s take him at his word and allocate the responsibility to the 25y/o and her bf!\nOur default reaction cannot be that there\u2019s a good chance a woman is a victim because of pregnancy out of wedlock. OP insinuated no such thing, not even close. \n\nChances are, the bf (or more likely, the guy she is seeing, I bet it\u2019s not monogamous.. not shaming, just how so many of us roll these days) whined how a condom doesn\u2019t feel good so he\u2019ll just pull out. And he\u2019s not ready to be a father nor does he want to be tied to this woman forever. \n\nNiece needs a reality check. \n\nNTA, OP.", "Sounds like you had same problem", "It is not his responsibility to help a 25 year old woman and her boyfriend a place to live. They are two grown adults who got themselves into this situation and can figure it out.", "Of course it's not his responsibility. But, you know, sometimes people who like and care for each other help each other out.", "Which he has already been doing for some time. The niece needs to accept her responsibilities as a   Mum to be, and work out her future plans.", "I'm not disagreeing, but like, my parents came apartment shopping with me the first time I was looking to buy because they were helping me find a place they thought I'd be happy/safe. Helping someone find a place to live doesn't mean looking at Zillow and offering money. It could be offering advice and asking \"what's the crime rate?\" God, do people genuinely think adults shouldn't get help for anything?"]}
