It's selfish of her to expect you to put up with a newborn in your house, she's taking advantage of your kindness.

You\u2019re extremely generous for letting your niece live with you as it is. But expecting you to also live with a newborn is taking advantage of your kindness.

It is your house. You have a right to enjoy your time off without having to hear a crying baby. Why isn't she living with her baby daddy?

She probably has tenant rights.", "Nope, NTA. She changed the conditions under which she would be living with you, you did not.", "NTA. Dear Lawd, where would this girl be if you hadn\u2019t allowed her to move in? She sounds a bit entitled. Why isn\u2019t she living with her bf?", "NTA. Your niece is an adult.

That would be faulty reasoning.", "Cold as it sounds, I\u2019d work on getting her out of your house sooner than later.

You\u2019ve shown her generosity and kindness but that\u2019s not an open door. I\u2019m guessing she hasn\u2019t moved in with bf yet because you offer a more pleasing housing situation. She isn\u2019t moving in with bf now? She\u2019s calling you an AH because her plans are ruined; either she is hoping she\u2019ll give you more support, she wants to get bf to move in, or both.

Good luck!", "NTA- You're collateral damage in a failed 'baby trap'- she thought if she got pregnant that would cause the BF to instantly create the stable home she's always wanted with her, and he's not ready for kids and freaked.", "oh my, how quickly they turn... all sweetness and light while she's taking but little miss nasty when you pull it back.   by giving her a stable place to stay you allowed her to address her problems and she's steady on her feet now.  you're absolutely correct that she needs to make arrangements to move in with the father of her child, who should be the providing the home and monetary support.  you've been very good to her and you most definitely do not need to give up your entire home and quiet existence for her new little project.  she needs to learn that having a baby means that she's all grown up now and her family is her baby and her baby daddy.  make sure you give her a time limit to move out so she doesn't drag it on and on and you have to deliver the baby yourself.  hopefully at some point in the future she'll be more appreciative of all that you've done for her.\n\nNTA", "NTA & she was really out of line. You have gone out of your way for her & the suggestion that she move in with The Impregnator was absolutely reasonable. \nIf she doesn\u2019t want to live with him, should she be having his baby? Either way, you\u2019re definitely NTA, your niece is lucky to have you.", "Not the AH. Newborns are obnoxious and loud.

He just stopped up the toilet with a toy, so now a plumber is needed AGAIN.  What you THINK you'll have to deal with (if she stays with the baby) is nothing compared to what will actually happen. What about the cost of child care? And be sure that her BF will practically move in.", "Where are her parents?  Also if you\u2019re gonna do adult things, you need to be prepared to handle the adult responsibilities and outcome.  It\u2019s not up to others to bail you out.

After giving birth she will need someone help her with baby I think you will help her this time too.", "NTA. Take steps now to evict her so she is gone well before the baby is born. Although she has been living there rent free you may still have to go through legal proceedings. Put everything in writing.", "NTA. This baby is the responsibility of its mother and father, not you. She is lucky you gave her a safe place to live when she needed it. You told her now that she will have to move instead of waiting until closer to the birth or after so she has time to make plans. Stick to your guns on this one or you will end up very resentful.", "NTA. She is 25 having a baby.

You can get a social worker to work with her to find a place, etc.", "Nta.  You never agreed to care for a newborn.  She clearly knows you live quietly and value the peace.

Newborns are rough. It's your home, and you get to choose what goes on in it.", "NTA\n\nLiving with a newborn is hectic and I totally understand why you don't want to take that on.

Why have a baby with someone she doesn\u2019t see as a good partner to live with and raise a baby with?", "NTA, she's going threw alot of hormonal changes now that she's pregnant and she probably just lashed out due to the hormones.

She made this decision and has no right to expect you to sacrifice anymore for her.", "NTA. many first time parents are irresponsible.  they get their S together and have another kid or two then are still young enough to be active with their kids when they go to college and make more money than their parents.\n\nyou told her right away.  that's the right thing", "After being called an asshole by the person to whom I've offered a roof when she was going through bard times, I'd personally give her only the legal eviction notice. If there is none, I'd give her a week. The niece sounds incredibly entitled and she needs to learn not to bite the hand that feeds her.", "Yeah, she made a grown up decision with another guy. They can deal with that themselves.

Op, state the very boundary you gave her that made you the bad person but YOU just like his niece will...still be mad?", "No. She screwed up and gets to face the consequences.", "No way. Once the baby is there, it would be a thousand times harder to make her leave. Actions have consequences. Niece needs to figure out new living arrangements now. OP is NTA.", "Sorry, but she's 25 not 16.. she is old enough to know what causes pregnancy, she is also old enough to realize that she interrupts your life style by being there alone. She should also be old enough to realize that adding a child to the mix would further disrupt your life and be a major inconvenience. Deciding to make that choice without consulting you was terrible form. It is your home and you were doing her a kindness by allowing her in it. But all things must end, and her new beginning with a family seems a good juncture to move herself towards complete independence. \n\nNTA - This is her opportunity to stand on her own and move her relationship forward with her S/O they made a choice now they have to  figure out the consequences. Not your circus, not your monkeys. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Update OP!", "She's expecting the boyfriend to move into your place as well. Be very careful and give her a notice period.", "AND I bet with the entitlement niece has already displayed she will expect OP to help. Because she's raising him all on her own and she needs a break. Or she'll want to move the bf in as well.", "Never said it was his responsibility.

My sister just doesn't think about cause and effect.  It's not malicious and she's not some mastermind.  The logical part of her brain is just broken or something?  So her life is a huge mess, and my parents had to legally adopt her four children because there wasn't really a better option?", "Oh. She has no intention. She\u2019s gonna go to school. Party. Live her young life. Work hang out and watch Netflix with her bf while uncle plays nanny. That\u2019s her plan.", "It's just so crazy to me. By the time I was 25 I'd been living out of home for over seven years.", "I would also place my bets on that. \nShe could dream of a (possible paid of) free house when OP dies or isn't able to life alone, with her BF and kid. \n\nAnd while they all live together OP can be a free babysitter and some kind of Grandpa who happly takes the kid for 6 days of the week.\n\nI cant blame OP to want peace at his age with a hard job. And who know how long he can still do that job hat his age. OP can't be blamed for not wanting a newborn in the house. They can be a handfull my sister got a Child at 16 he was a quit baby but even those cry a lot, can piss from one end of room to the other. \n\n\nP.S. english is not my first language and I have sleep problems so awake for over 30 hours.", "Condoms are free at the clinic\u2026", "And no one is saying that.

Those women shouldn't fuck men, period. Not having sex won't kill you. Getting pregnant in the US easily might.", "You are assuming many things not being said. Also, this isn\u2019t a post that says am I the AH for not taking my niece to another state to get an abortion.

All birth control can fail. We all know this. We make a conscious decision to engage in sexual activity, we make a conscious decision to be ready to take care of a child.", "Agreed.  I understand where you are coming from on this. OP is definately NTA, however a damaged 25 year old fell pregnant and asks for help from the person she trusts. I can understand why she is upset (regardless of whether I think the upset is justified) while also not thinking the OP is at fault.\nAnd also while feeling deeply uncomfortable with the barrage of comments that fall into the 'selfish woman always getting themselves pregnant to manipulate people' trope. \n\n\nSo to be clear, OP is not the asshole, but many of the commenters may be.", "Given that OP said she's excited about being pregnant it's very unlikely she was not consenting, and she very clearly doesn't want an abortion. With that in mind she had access to the cheapest and most effective form of birth control: Not having sex.\n\nYes a condom can break, it happens. It's rare for that to happen in a way that neither partner notices, so the morning after pill was probably an option. (I can't say 100% as I don't know how much it would cost where she lives.) At her age she's been hearing about birth control for years, I find it very hard to believe she missed the message that a single method is not enough.\n\nOP should have asked her intentions before telling her she would have to leave, that much I agree with. For all he knows she had thought about it and had tentative plans, but he jumped straight to kicking her out. He owes her an apology and should listen to what she wants/intends to do.", "Bold of you to believe she intends to work!", "At 25, I was independent with a uni degree for years and onto carrying bubs no2. I don't shame people for living at home, the world is crazy these days. It's an excellent situation but you can't alter the living arrangements drastically and be shocked the owner of said home isn't okay with it.", "OP didn\u2019t specify they\u2019re in the US but housing prices in a lot of places are garbage, so if the guy is around her age it\u2019s also possible he\u2019s just starting out in his career and doesn\u2019t make a lot and is living with roommates or his parents or something.", "She also doesn\u2019t have to be a mother.", "Nicely said", "So is birth control.  They should have used both.", "They work every time then? Never break? How utopian of you.", "Who says she didn\u2019t take responsibility? No form of contraception is 100% effective.\n\nAnd yeah 25 is an adult, but it is still young, she\u2019s clearly had a rough start in life and if you made a mistake wouldn\u2019t you want your families support?

Oh wow, we\u2019re really being progressive here today.", "Oh please, of course it can fail. You\u2019re telling me that at every stage in your life when you\u2019ve been having sex you\u2019d be happy to take on the responsibility for a child?", "If I were a troubled 25 year old and someone extended their home and care to me you bet your bottom dollar I\u2019d do everything to make them proud of me. Cause it\u2019s a cold world out there and clearly the man she\u2019s stooping isn\u2019t an option. But that is her fault for choosing him. And it is her grown a$$ responsibility to have responsible sex. She\u2019s 25 not 16.", "Yeah I agree. OP is NTA but neither is the niece. It\u2019s a complicated situation and he hasn\u2019t given enough detail for any of us to really get a fully picture.\n\nPeople are just so quick to judge a woman whose pregnant, when they don\u2019t even know if she intended to be or not. It\u2019s sad.", "Where is the boyfriend's responsibility?  The uncle has nothing to do with this.", "You\u2019re right. Lol what was I thinking.", "That's also a possibility, but at any rate, OP's niece and her bf don't seem like they're in a good position to become parents. She's likely hoping OP will support her baby.", "Truth", "Why is this the uncle's problem?  He had nothing to do with the pregnancy.  She had a boyfriend and was having sex, they knew the risks. She and the boyfriend need to figure this out.", "He has supported her. Enough that she was doing well. He\u2019s done more than enough.", "Yes. And thereby force men to abstain.\n\nPerhaps eventually they'll start to care whether women have human rights.", ">Oh wow, we\u2019re really being progressive here today.\n\nNo, we are being adults and dealing with the current reality.  It's a big responsibility to bring a child into the world.  If someone isn't up to the task they need to forgo the moment of pleasure that can lead to creating the child.  It's calmed personal responsibility.\n\nBTW, did either of these two bother to vote?", "She intended to have sex with her boyfriend.  If she didn't, that's a whole different story and she needs to file charges.  \n\nThe niece and her boyfriend are 100% responsible for this, the uncle is not.", "When adults are sponging off an extended relative and then they make a choice that will completely disrupt that extended relative\u2019s life and they don\u2019t even ask if it\u2019s okay then they no longer have any expectation of even consideration from that relative. Do you really think this niece would be content with OP apartment hunting with her? Come on, she called him an AH for saying he didn\u2019t want to live with a newborn. I bet she thought the baby would be her way to guilt OP to take care of her indefinitely and it has blown up in her face. Why anyone thinks it\u2019s ok to bring a baby that have no plan of providing for into this world in beyond me."]}
