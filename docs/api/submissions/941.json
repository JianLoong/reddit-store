But you also don't get to hold it over everyone's head.\n\nIn your position, if I really did not want to sleep on a rollaway, I would do the math on how much my friends would be paying to stay in that room just the two of them, and if it was reasonable, get my own room.  There are only so many sacrifices I can take.  But I wouldn't expect to stay in a the room with them and never take the rollaway bed, just because I had used points to pay for flights they would not have purchased if I had no had points to do so.\n\nAlso, it is rare in the US to have rooms with just one bed, unless you specifically select a king.  Most rooms have two double beds, outside of denser cities like NYC.  That certainly seems a better arrangement than a rollaway bed.", "YTA... for not going to a baseball game! ;)\n\nBut really, NTA.

Nit that there is anything wrong with not wanting a room for yourself either, but there were other ways to go about this that didnt include making them feel small for something you offered, that they accepter, yes, but didnt ask for.\n\nIf i were your friends i would pay back each dime, go without you, and cut you off my life.

I think the hotel costs were a surprise to all of us, though I was still willing to get my own room like usual even with the higher cost.
