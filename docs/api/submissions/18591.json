My parents didn't know it at the time when they named me. It wasn't used that way in my country and it is just a pretty sounding name. My mom said she actually named me after my grandma's favorite song. \n\nThe thing is, that I really LOVE my first name. I *hate* my middle name and I have never gone by a nickname in my life. My name is a major part of my identity. \n\nSo I told the supervisor I wasn't comfortable using another name. The people in our group who were initially bothered by it escalated things to HR and HR basically came back saying that since it is my legal name they can't force me to go by anything else. \n\nAfter HR basically told them nothing could be done, it became really apparent which of the other girls are the ones who took issue with my name. They started referring to me by my last name alone. My last name is stupidly common, there is another person on our team who shares it, and a 2nd person who shares a name very similar to it (literally 1 letter off). They do not refer to any of the other people in our group by last name alone. \n\nSo I started ignoring them. They'll go \"Lastname. LASTNAME. HEY LASTNAME\" and I just calmly look at them and say \"My name is X. If you need my attention, you will need to refer to me by my name\"\n\nI know it is causing problems in the group and that they are mad at me about it. But, like, it's my actual name. It feels like shitty bullying being singled out with this last name crap.\n\nAITA for insisting on being called my name if it makes people uncomfortable?\n\nETA: We are all American and native english speakers\n\nEDIT 2: For clarification, most people in the US do not realize my name is a slur. It is more commonly used as a slur in european countries. It's censored on sites like pinterest but there have been celebrities with the same first name, it is used commonly in songs and pop culture here as well.", "created_utc": 1685494815, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w7rne/aita_for_refusing_to_go_by_another_name_and/", "score": 589, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You also can't force people to say a slur when they don't feel comfortable doing so, even if it is your name. I 100% understand why your coworkers are reluctant to use it - I don't like saying the word myself, I will say it for people's names but doing so makes me cringe a little bit, I won't lie.

And even putting aside how your parents could have just, You know, researched the actual foreign name they were giving their child, do you walk around using the r word?

It is a racial slur against Romani people. It's not the literal worst slur out there, but that doesn't make it not a slur.

I'm surprised you haven't encountered this to this extreme before.", "YTA.  If someone's uncomfortable using a racial slur, it's perfectly reasonable for them to refer to you by your last name.

I get that it can be annoying to be called something other than your name if you prefer your name, but you can\u2019t force people to say a slur to get your attention.

My parents didn't know it at the time when they named me. It wasn't used that way in my country and it is just a pretty sounding name. My mom said she actually named me after my grandma's favorite song. \n\nThe thing is, that I really LOVE my first name. I *hate* my middle name and I have never gone by a nickname in my life. My name is a major part of my identity. \n\nSo I told the supervisor I wasn't comfortable using another name. The people in our group who were initially bothered by it escalated things to HR and HR basically came back saying that since it is my legal name they can't force me to go by anything else. \n\nAfter HR basically told them nothing could be done, it became really apparent which of the other girls are the ones who took issue with my name. They started referring to me by my last name alone. My last name is stupidly common, there is another person on our team who shares it, and a 2nd person who shares a name very similar to it (literally 1 letter off). They do not refer to any of the other people in our group by last name alone. \n\nSo I started ignoring them. They'll go \"Lastname. LASTNAME. HEY LASTNAME\" and I just calmly look at them and say \"My name is X. If you need my attention, you will need to refer to me by my name\"\n\nI know it is causing problems in the group and that they are mad at me about it. But, like, it's my actual name. It feels like shitty bullying being singled out with this last name crap.\n\nAITA for insisting on being called my name if it makes people uncomfortable?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But I'd give it a week maybe after the email just so you can see who out of all of them are going to try to continue calling you by your surname. If you complain straight away after the 1st person does it, you don't get to report others that would have continued. So I'd give it a week or so, to make sure they've all had plenty of time to read the email, and just keep a note of who has continued to refer to you by your surname during that week, with a date and time roughly etc. Then go to Hr with the list of bullies names. If they confront you about your name again, and say anything rude or unkind about you wanting to be called by your name, write down everything they said / what you said and where you were when the conversation took place etc. (You may have cameras in your workplace that they can check and listen to depending on your company). But it also shows clear evidence of when and where it happened, if the confrontation was just spur of the moment or whether they came to you to talk about a work thing, but called you by your surname, and that provoked the conversation etc. \nEvidence can make all the difference. \n\nBut don't let this slide, and don't be manipulated or bullied into accepting being called something else other than your given legal name.

It\u2019s also not their fault that your parents chose this name and it\u2019s not their fault that now it\u2019s a slur. I would call you Ms. Last name. Sorry but that\u2019s the only option for me.", "I\u2019m sorry that you feel an ethnic slur is so central to your identity, despite not actually sharing that ethnic identity but it\u2019s weird that you won\u2019t let people just call you \u2018G\u2019 or your last name or anything neutral. Is your personality based on making others uncomfortable?\nJust feels like a weird power play on your end.", "They\u2019re singling you out cause you\u2019re the ONE with a racist name. \n\nThey\u2019re not calling anyone else by their surname alone because no one else has a racist name.", "If they\u2019re bullying you it\u2019s because you\u2019re trying to make them use racist language. If this is such an issue leave your job. Find one with ppl who don\u2019t mind being racist.", "Because no one else has a racist first name!! I\u2019m starting to think this post is fake. No one can be this stuck in their ways.", "No, they said they can't do anything about OP ignoring them.  They didn't say that OP could force them to use the slur. And because HR's purpose is to make sure the company is liable for as little as possible, they'll continue to sit on that non-position as long as they can", "No they said they could force her to use another name bc it\u2019s her legal name. I didn\u2019t see anythjng about them making the coworkers use it bc that would also open them up to hella lawsuits. \n\nThis whole situation is exactly why people aren\u2019t going to want to hire OP just by seeing her name at the top of a resume.", "I feel like this response seals it. \n\n>Our clerk of register has the legal right to refuse names deemed offensive or otherwise inappropriate.\n\nYou are absolutely  NTA", "I'm married to a native American. Her entire family is native American. My best friend since I was 12 yo is native American his entire family was native American. I've literally spent time on reserves with these people.", "Thank you lol. I don't know why the other person got so defensive about it. I was just shocked as I'm married to a native, so I'm spent a fair amount of time around them.", "Seriously?? Dude. Romani people aren\u2019t from or related in any way to Romania. \n\nHalf those links were from American newspapers about Americans finding it offensive. So yes, it is considered offensive here.\n\nRomani people have been persecuted for centuries. They put them in death camps, ffs.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_Holocaust", ">and it\u2019s not their fault that now it\u2019s a slur. \n\nEven before it was a slur, so gross to name someone Gypsy when they're not Romani.\ud83e\udd22", "> If this is such an issue leave your job.\n\nI'm not going anywhere.", "they also said they couldn\u2019t force OP to go by another name so"]}
