They now have 2 kids together. I talk to him about once every 2 months, but for the past 10 years he's been pretty preoccupied with his new family. This doesn't really bother me since I'm a fully grown adult with a new life in a different country.\n\nHe recently reached out to me as he's getting married in two months, and asked if I'd make a 16 hour flight to attend. I'm between jobs and trying to save money, but I cancelled the budget holiday I had planned (\\~$300) to book a trip to his country instead (\\~$4000+). The decision wasn't entirely selfless since it's been 6 years since I've been back and my partner really wanted to see where I grew up, so we're both pretty excited for the trip. \n\nA couple of weeks after I RSVP'ed he called me up. I was intending to ask what they wanted for a wedding present, figuring we could still grab something modest in addition to the money we're spending on travel and accommodation, but before I could bring it up he asked if I would be their wedding photographer for the entire day and deliver a set of professionally edited photographs a few weeks after the wedding (for FREE). I was floored. I haven't done photography professionally for over 10 years for one, but the idea that my own father wants me to be the photographer rather than a guest at his wedding when I'm spending so much time and money to be there really hurt. He mentioned it was his fianc\u00e9e's idea which checks out, but I'm still really upset that he's now asking me to do $4k free work on top of paying that just to attend, and essentially miss out on being part of the party. It seems like he just doesn't understand the work involved, but surely he's not THAT dumb, right? I told him I'll just grab some photos on my phone because all of my photography gear is 10 years old and takes worse photos now anyway (which is true).

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if your father is unaware of how much work it takes to professionally edit pictures and video from a wedding. I know I don\u2019t, but I know that almost everything done well takes time, effort, and attention to detail.", "NTA i would have just refused in your shoes but whatever makes you confortable.\n\nAlso if you do plan to take some pictures on your phone make sure he understands it so he actually plans for a photographer. You don\u2019t want him or the wife blaming after the wedding if they don\u2019t like it.", "IMO you answered him by telling him that your equipment is old.  Suggest he hire someone local and then he will see how much it costs.  They might already know and is why they are asking.  Telling him it is a disappointment that he wants you to work instead of being a guest will let you know his true intentions by his reaction.  If he only wants a free photographer then make the trip for your wife but don\u2019t attend the wedding while you are there.  Don\u2019t bother to tell them you are not attending, just don\u2019t show up.", "Charge him 4k upfront.    \nNTA.", "Wow, my husband is a professional photographer/videographer and the amount of time involved in doing a professional wedding job is just unbelievable. Most people really don\u2019t get it. They think \u201csnap, snap\u201d and you\u2019re done. Maybe y\u2019all should sit down and explain to dad and his bride what he\u2019s ACTUALLY asking you to do. Just reading this makes me tired. My spouse easily spends 30-40 hours preparing, shooting, editing his wedding jobs. Mostly while dressed in wedding finery, which could mean a tux.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nConsider telling him exactly what he was asking of you, and how much it hurt that he wanted his own daughter to work rather than attend his wedding as a valued guest. He needs to know how he\u2019s made you feel.", "Not the AH but you need to tell Dad NO. It is a complete sentence. Otherwise he will badger you when you are there to do more than a few photos from your phone.", "NTA.  But you could offer to give him a set amount of cash, as his wedding gift, so that they can hire someone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not only is he being horrible to you, but he's being INCREDIBLY cheap with his own wedding.

(Yah, I just showed my age cause Im not even sure they sell those anymore). Honestly, they were evenly great and not so great photos. \n\nSince you are correct in phones being better quality than older equipment, offer to make business cards with a qrc code that leads to a drop box/google folder whatever, where wedding goers can upload their pics and put them on the tables at the reception. Cost you maybe $10 on a site like Vista print and gets you out of official photography duty. Your $4k plane tickets to be there are a gift enough.", "Yeah, it's a mistake to agree to this request. Just say that photography is a part of your past and you're not able to assist but you're looking forward to attending.\n\nSay it like it's no big deal. Just keep politely and blandly refusing if they try to engage or insist.\n\nYour dad is just doing what the person who keeps his bed warm asks him to do.
