Probably not, and that was obviously proven by the actions him and his little friends took. \n\nSecondly, although he is your family, he is not your child.

If your sister is willing to verbally abuse somebody from whom she *wants* something, you're 100% in the right to tell her no and to sod off regardless of what she wants, but in this case, 10x more so, as you're not the one who raised their son to behave so badly.

You are deluded into thinking that somehow my money will get a different result. It won't and while I get that it's no risk to you if it doesn't, it is my choice and I'd get the same result from setting fire to it, but it's all a moot point because as I've said, I'm not rewarding bully behavior. As long as you think you are ENTITLED to anything you will get nothing. Do not ever come at me that way again.", "WTF is a lawyer supposed to do when the crime is on video?

I might have even considered N A H, as of course parents would want to secure the best defense possible for their kid.\n\nI agree with your reasoning though. You think your nephew should learn his lesson. I guess it's what some would call \"tough love.\" I think you're right in that he should learn that actions have consequences. \n\nAnd he is not your own child. He is your nephew. You are not directly responsible for him. So it is not your business.\n\nHis parents would be more helpful if they were not trying to get him off the hook.

Your sister needs to face facts that your nephew is screwed and if she magically finds a lawyer who says they can get him off scot-free, she should run because that attorney is probably one ethics complaint away from being disbarred, lol. Prosecutors love an easy win and your nephew handed that to them on a silver platter. Is it a bummer *for him* that being 18 means that this is likely going to follow him for the rest of his life? Yeah. But that\u2019s not your problem. He\u2019s the one who decided internet clout > starting adulthood with a clean record.

No.", "NTA -  Nephew made a choice, now he gets to experience the consequences of that choice.

Will he be assigned a lawyer if you don\u2019t pay (as he would in the States), or would he not have representation at all?

It's not your responsibility to bail him out. Your sister and brother-in-law need to accept that and start preparing for the worst. Maybe it will teach your nephew a lesson about being responsible. And if your sister is going to call you every name in the book just because you won't give money to her stupid kid, then she's the asshole.", "NTA, it is simply not your responsibility to pay for such a thing for your nephew. I'm sure his mom is desperate to do something that will help her sons and I'm sure has strong emotions because of this. I'm sure that's partially why she reacted the way she did. I would give her some grace, but no I don't think you need to or should pay for his legal representation or are wrong to not want to.", "Are they looking for legal representation, or legal representation that promises nephew will not go to jail? Because it sounds like they want your money to hire the \"big guns\" to get nephew off without consequences.\n\n\nNTA for not wanting to contribute if they will only hire a lawyer who promises to get nephew off the hook. If they are reasonable and hire a lawyer that will get nephew through the case with the least harsh sentence they can negotiate but ensures that nephew learns his lesson, then it might be nice to pay the initial retainer.", "Nope, NTA. Nephew is 18. That means he is legally responsible for his actions. I know you arent American, but we have a saying here: Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. His parents are lashing out because they are beginning to realize that their son has thrown his life away. Don't let them rope you into paying for his mistake.", "NTA, her kid did a very, very stupid thing, now he has to pay for it and she should ask herself what the hell did she do while raising her kid that he's dumb enough to try to steal a car and record the whole thing for the internet.", "NTA 100%. While this isn\u2019t your responsibility you may want to consider the damage this situation is having on the relationship with your sister and her family. I\u2019m not saying you should give them the money, only consider the cost of the actual money you\u2019d be losing against the cost of your family\u2019s relationships. This is the kind of thing that fractures families for a lifetime. Sometimes even though you\u2019re 100% correct, it might be worth the cost to help them, in spite of your convictions.", "NTA - I can't help but think that if you were to contribute to your nephew's mis-adventure that helping pay for the wrecked car would have more immediate positive results than paying a lawyer. No, you don't have to, but if you wanted to, paying towards the car wouldn't be wasting the money.", "NTA- it is not your responsibility or problem. His actions were serious and they come with serious consequences. You are not entitled to give money to them for anything, unless you want to help him get credit on his books while he is locked up. \n\nHowever, he can use the prayer for judgement to possibly help him in this case. You can only use it one time in your life. I\u2019m not sure if it varies in other states but in NC you can use it, but I\u2019m not sure how it works given the severity of the case and if it can be used. He would first need to plead guilty, and immediately at the same time after he says he pleads guilty and is responsible ask the judge for the judgement to be continued and ask for a prayer of judgement. If he is granted the prayer for judgement , it won\u2019t be counted against him or entered against him.

They have to blame someone. \n\nSince fault can\u2019t lie with their son, the car thief, or the car thief\u2019s parents, it Must be your fault!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why should you have to pay for his mistake? \n\nSo in their eyes, their son messes up = you pay up. They're out of their minds.", "I mon", "INFO: what country are you from? What\u2019s the possible penalty? Is it a life in prison situation?", "NTA \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA..  this is not a case of a false accusation and restoring his reputation. Tell her you will help him with rehabilitation when he gets out, if he wants to turn his life around.", "Nailed it! Bet OP has always been the family scapegoat, too. Enough is enough.", "Might as well pile all the cash in a trash bin and light it on fire.", "They're not in the US, so that may not be so.", "They explained in a comment further up the thread, but it isn't even applicable to all the US, apparently\u2014only the state of North Carolina.", "Which is basically how it works, so yeah, I'm not a fan of that element of USian laws.", "Well, obviously to me now, it is a different legal system and a different culture.  It is hard to offer judgement across cultures.  What may by asshole behavior in one culture may not be so in another.  So, I think it comes down to this: how important is family in your culture and is prison a near certainty regardless of the lawyer's ability.  If the outcome is certain, then there is no point in throwing away the money.  If family matters and money can change the outcome, then I would judge you to be TA if you did not offer assistance.", "You see what I mean about the assumptions? <headshake>", "Reddit is headquartered in the USA, so it\u2019s easy for Americans to assume. :) \n\nBut the UK and Canada both have really knowledgeable legal threads on this platform; maybe search \u201clegal\u201d with your nation added??? \n\nBest of luck to you. It\u2019s sad your sister even asked.", "NTA. It will be good for him to face the consequences of his actions. This isn't your problem to finance or fix.", "NTA, she should be ashamed for raising a criminal.", "NTA. As everyone else has said, he is going to reap the consequences of his actions.\n\nDo they not have legal aid or similar where you are? Can he still get a lawyer, just not one your sister wants?", "NTA. Kid stole a car and then wrecked it. Nobody cares if he planned on returning it. And even if he didn\u2019t wreck it, if the folks that had their car stolen went out to use said car after he took it, they would have called the police and had him arrested. This is not a petty crime or one of those situations where maybe somebody didn\u2019t understand the law (not that that\u2019s defensible legally anyway), he stole a flippin car!!! Like small children know that stealing cars is super illegal and you can go to jail for that. Sorry for your nephew, but that was just over the top stupid and he\u2019s gonna have to pay the price", "NTA.\n\nYou would actually become an enabler if you did pay for his legal costs.\n\nHe needs to learn the consequences of his actions and to accept responsibility for them.", "NTA - he facqued around and found out. Not taking legal advice from solicitors is a sign that the parents are facquing around and will find out too. Hopping from one solicitor to another is just about as stooopid and a cost they should bear.", "NTA.  If an 18 year-old thinks it\u2019s a great idea to steal a car, apparently they need a hard lesson in why you don\u2019t steal a car.  I would not give them anything.", "NTA. I bet this isn'tthe first time they have been in denial about his behavior", "You are not an AH.  Your nephew is a foolish thief.  The action of taking someone else's car without permission is theft.  The supposed intention of returning it is immaterial to the theft .   Wrecking that car is not a shocking outcome .  I hope no one was hurt.  An 18 year old that steals a car deserves prison time, and to have to pay to reimburse the owner.  kt", "NTA, not your circus, not your monkeys. Sounds like nephew needs some time to think about his life choices. My guess is, he'll have some now.", "NTA. Sounds like the mom just doesn't want him to learn any sort of lesson", "NTA. Your nephew messed up and his parents are trying to help him hide. He\u2019s not a child and cannot be treated like one. He should have thought his choices through before risking his future. No one is responsible for him except himself. His parents are only enabling his childishness.", "NTA.  It sounds like a waste of money.", "So essentially he\u2019s been unlucky on the timing; he might have been offered diversion or whatever if he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to do what everyone else was doing at the moment. \n\nI don\u2019t think that your reasoning about learning a lesson is sound; the main thing most young crooks learn in prison is how to be more professional at crime, sadly. But I still think that your are NTA because it\u2019s a waste of money if his parents are just going to fire lawyers when they don\u2019t like the answer. It\u2019s not going to help you nephew.", "OP wasn\u2019t asking for legal advice. They were asking if they were an asshole for not helping their nephew."]}
