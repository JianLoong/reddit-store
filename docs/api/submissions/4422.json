PLEASE decide what is more important to you, keeping a relationship with your girlfriend or being right about a really shitty joke. \n\nPS - the jokes were not the same and if you felt uncomfortable by what she said, the answer would have been to either talk to her about it later or take her aside and tell her you don\u2019t like it when she implies another girl is bangable (even if she\u2019s straight) THE ANSWER IS NOT to imply you are only with your girlfriend because your female friend didn\u2019t want to fuck you.

In your \u201cjoke\u201d you implied that the only reason you are with your current girlfriend is because maisie wouldn\u2019t fuck you.

So yes your the asshole and should apologize to your girlfriend and explain that you genuinely were just making a joke that your not interested in her romantically and that you love your girlfriend and your sorry you hurt her cause that wasn\u2019t your intention. While I agree your aloud to think other people are attractive just like she is doesnt mean that you should joke about being with other women in that manner.

The only non AH here is your friend.", "its not the same joke.\n\nYou said you're only with your gf, cause you can't have Maisie as a gf.   \nYour gf said Maisie is so hot she'd smash her. which didn't imply anything about you being a 2nd choice", "Because your girlfriend is straight, so THAT is why it\u2019s a good joke. Yours just completely humiliated her, and -I cannot stress this enough- **could be true**\n\nSo yeah YTA. I hope for your own growth and your relationship in general that you realise what we\u2019re telling you", "No it wasn't a joke. You literally wrote you think she's hot and wanted her and the only reason you're with your girlfriend is because she shot you down. Your girlfriend made an an actual joke because she's not attracted to her and doesn't want her. You on the other hand would jump on this girl if given the chance. You're immature since you refuse to see the difference between the two. If the ages are even real I would be shocked. This is high school/middle school mentality.", "The thing is, what she said was a joke because she didn't mean it. What you said wasn't a joke because you actually would. That's why it's not funny, that's why she's not happy about it. Don't you see that?", "But you didn\u2019t just say she was hot. You insulted your own girlfriends looks. Your GF made a joke without insulting anyone. You however had to make her feel like trash in your joke, as it is quite possible from what you said, that you do want to hook up with your friend. Again, she was basically just saying she was pretty. She wasn\u2019t going to cheat on you.", "Realizing someone is attractive is not the same as fantasizing about having sex with them. I'd hate to see the way you were looking at your \"friend\" during the show. Start putting the moves on your her again now because I'm sure you'll be single within a week, the way you're doubling down in the comments and not accepting the judgement you posted for. \n\nThis is \"am I the asshole\" not \"tell me I'm right and my gf is wrong.\" The general consensus is that you were a huge asshole. Accept it, apologize, and move the fuck on before your girlfriend moves on without you.", "YTA\n\nGood gods, you really are this obtuse, aren't you?", "From your comments I can tell you only came here to garner support and throw it in your girlfriend's face. You're absolutely the asshole. So many times over. You're just lashing out at all of the comments that don't agree with you. If you weren't ready for an honest opinion, then don't come to this sub...", "The \"but\" is an excuse and voids the apology", "No point in saying sorry if you don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re apologizing. Consider a reversal of roles, you jokingly tell one of her guy friends you\u2019d get with him any day and in response your girlfriend admits she\u2019s always found him hot and states that she\u2019s only with you because she isn\u2019t with him. You\u2019re a straight guy so there\u2019s obviously no real attraction and a harmless joke. Your girlfriend however is also straight and has just Admit in front of you that she would sleep with a close friend of hers and can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re upset. Use your brain and try to have some god damn common sense here. Your ex girlfriend deserves better.", "So no then.", "\u201cSorry I offended you\u201d is a bs apology too.", "To break it down:\n\nYour girlfriend said your friends hot and she would smash. \n\nIF\n\nYou had said the friend\u2019s hot and you would smash too, THEN maybe you could say you made the same joke as your girlfriend. So I could understand you not understanding what the problem is. \n\nHOWEVER\n\nWhat you ACTUALLY said was that the only reason you\u2019re with your girlfriend is because your friend wouldn\u2019t sleep with you. Meaning you settled for your girlfriend. \n\nSee the difference? In the first one, you both would be commenting on the hotness of your friend. \n\nIn the second one, you commented on the hotness of the friend, said you wanted to sleep with her and insulted your girlfriend by saying you settled for her. \n\nA HUGE difference. In conclusion, you DID NOT make the same joke. Not even close. You insulted your girlfriend while telling others that you wanted to sleep with your friend.", "Hello queer person here. What OP said is extremely different from what his gf said and a lot more hurtful. She complemented the dancer while he straight up called his gf consolation. \u201cI\u2019m with her bc you didn\u2019t want to smash me\u201d \nNot a harmless joke. Insult to gf.", "And additionally, her joke sets up a premise that could never be true, because she is not attracted to women. Whereas his joke could be true...and sounds like it is.", "No, but does it matter? It was J O K E.", "Thank you, yes!! I was disgusted by everyone except the friend here.", "Here\u2019s a chance for you to learn a new thing! \n\nA joke is only funny if both people laugh. \n\nYour girlfriend did not laugh. She thought it was hurtful. So while you may have thought it was funny, she did not, and now she is mad. \n\nGoing forward, you need to learn how to respond when you hurt someone\u2019s feelings. \n\nYou do not double down on their hurt feelings and try to show them how wrong their hurt feelings are. \n\nYou DO say, oh no girlfriend, I am so sorry. My intention was not to ever hurt you. My joke was in poor taste and I really apologize. I am sorry I hurt you. \n\nEnd. No buts. No, but it\u2019s a joke. \n\nYou told a bad joke. You hurt someone you love. Fix it with a sincere apology.", "Because you are attracted to woman and your girlfriend is not? She wouldn't actually fuck your friend or want to. The same cannot be said for you. Especially when you joke about only being with your girlfriend because your friend wouldn't sleep with you. Something being a joke doesn't absolve it from being shitty.", ">It was J O K E.\n\nHonestly, that's completely irrelevant.  Whether you were joking or not, you told your girlfriend that she's second best in front of a whole bunch of people.  You completely humiliated her and I can guarantee you that almost everyone there walked out of there going \"Yikes, poor OP's gf, that was harsh.\"\n\nOh and by the way, if it WAS the same joke, what your girlfriend would ACTUALLY have said is \"Maisie, say the word and I'll drop this loser for you right this second.\"", "Not the same joke. You didn't just say you would smash Maisie too (Still bad, but at lease equivalent to what gf said) - you said you won't be with your current gf if Maisie had wanted to smash you previously. HUGE difference.", "to you it was. to your gf (& anyone else listening in), you basically said that if maisie gave you the time of day you\u2019d ditch your gf for her.\n\njust like she doesn\u2019t tell a random dude that she would smash him if she wasn\u2019t with you, you don\u2019t tell another woman you\u2019re only with your gf bc the other woman won\u2019t hook up with you.\n\nYTA", "Fine flip the tables. If she WAS into chicks and said that, how would you feel? Not only said she wanted to fuck her, but she was only with you because her friend wouldn't fuck her. \n\nIts not rocket science and you playing dense makes YTA way more than just some numbskull who just doesn't understand.", "Why did you post if you can't accept the answer?", "It is only a J O K E if everyone finds it funny, bro.", "It wasn't F U N N Y and it was H U R T F U L and you should A P O L O G I Z E, N O W.", "It\u2019s amazing how hard this simple concept is for some guys. For my husband, the struggle is real.", "So, I never get to make this joke because I\u2019m bi?\n\nNot trying to be obtuse, I use this sub to learn.", "The comment the girlfriend made was basically \"wow you're hot! I'd fuck you\"\n\nThe comment OP made was basically \"you're hotter than my girlfriend and I'm only with her because you wouldn't fuck me\"\n\nI don't think sexuality should really matter here. I'd feel the same if OP and his girlfriend were any combo of genders/sexualities.", "Joking with a friend \"you're so hot, I'd totally do you\" when everyone knows it's a joke is VERY different from saying to your partner, \"I'm only with you because that friend wouldn't sleep with me.\" Those are NOT the same joke, and the second one is not okay to say regardless of the gender or sexuality of the people involved. \n\nI'm a lesbian, and I have made jokes like the one your gf made with female friends where we had the kind of relationship where it was obviously not serious and everyone thought it was funny. My ex-girlfriend would make that kind of joke with her friends too, and I also thought it was funny. If she had said the joke YOU made to me...no, that's not okay. You CAN make the kind of joke your girlfriend made in contexts where it's clear that it's a joke. What you said was a very different thing that was mean and not okay.", "I think I just fucked up on the reading comprehension. Sorry. \n\nWait. No. I\u2019m not disagreeing OP is TA. I\u2019m saying the sexuality argument was wrong.  You\u2019re agreeing with me.", "It sounds like you think I\u2019m the OP.  I agree OP is TA, but I don\u2019t see what sexuality has to do with it.", "Ha! Yeah, sorry about the confusion. I was agreeing with you that sexuality shouldn't matter for the appropriateness of this kind of 'joke', and then going more in-depth about why OP's comment in particular wasn't okay, regardless of sexuality.", "Agree sexuality doesn't matter in this context. If my wife said 'damn I'd fuck them' regarding a male or female, I wouldn't care because I know it's a joke. However, if she said 'damn I'm only fucking you because I can't fuck them' I'd be rightfully hurt.\nAnd this is exactly what OP has done, its a real hurtful comment to his GF and made her realise she was just little more than a rebound to him. \nWorst still he keeps doubling down on trying to claim it was a joke."]}
