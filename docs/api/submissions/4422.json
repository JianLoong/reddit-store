{"id": 4422, "submission_id": "zhzyag", "title": "AITA for what I said to my girlfriend?", "selftext": "Me (24M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together for almost three years.\n\nIn a few days a friend of mine (\"Maisie\", 24F) is going to have a dance show with a group of friends of her dance studio and she invited all of our friend group to go see the show and some of the rehearsals to give them our inputs. I invited my girlfriend over.\n\nYesterday was one of the lasts rehearsals and my friends, me and my girlfriend were there to watch. Maisie is hot as fuck and I won't deny that, and yesterday she was showing off a bit of sexier moves in her number. By the end of the practice, my girlfriend shouted something like \"I would smash you anytime if you wanted to\", and everyone laughed if off, Maisie asked me if I didn't mind my girlfriend hitting on her right in front of me and I replied \"hell no, I'm with her because you didn't want to smash me anytime too\" and everyone laughed it off as well.\n\nSee, this was in the middle of her practice and it was no way meant in a harmful way the same way what she said was nothing but a joke. Everyone laughed, everyone didn't give a second thought about any of that exchange of words. But, after I was home, my girlfriend called me furious/devastated saying that I implied she was some consolation prize because Maisie didn't want me before and in front of everyone no less. I explained that it was as much of a joke as what she said but she said that no, it wasn't because I know she is straight and would never smash any girl and I replied that she should know that I wouldn't smash any girl either because I'm with her.\n\nThis rant went on night ahead and she said that I was feeding her insecurities and jealousy over Maisie, when I kept insisting it was just a stupid joke that SHE had started. She was completely monosyllabic with me today and it seems that we are in cold terms.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Bear with me now.\n\nUnlike every fucking one says, I actually accept the consensus and I get I am the asshole. After I post it here and the first comments appeared I talked to Maisie. (To the ones who were concerned, no, Maisie didn't mind the jokes, but I thought it's cute how some of y'all worried about her). She said she wouldn't be offended but could see where my girlfriend was coming from and suggested me an conversation in person. Well enough, I tried calling my girlfriend (she didn't pick up) and I left a message that I'll paste in here:\n\n>I am astronomically sorry about all this mess. I know I have been the most dumb and stupid guy since yesterday for not addressing this whole situation properly since yesterday, but listen now. I am really really sorry for hurting you, my love. And believe when I say that there is no woman in this world that I would stop me from being with you. You're absolutely the most gorgeous, finest and adorable person I have ever even dreamt about knowing and you just can't imagine how in love I am with you. Whenever you feel comfortable to talk to me again, I will be right here, you just need to call.\n\nIf any of you it's actually interested in my relationship I could give an update when/if she answer me.\n\nNow, let me address some things.\n\n1. I responded to literally 4 comments right in the second I posted it, it does not mean I didn't accept your judgement or I didn't want your opinions or, as stated, that all I wanted was to gather affirmations to throw at my girlfriend's face. I literally just answered to first comments that showed up.\n2. I DO NOT want to fuck with Maisie. I DID NOT try to fuck with Maisie. As I said countless times, >> it was a joke, it was not true <<. I see that it was a stupid joke and that it hurt my girlfriend and I am sorry about what I said now. But no, NO, there is no truth in what I said and just don't know where in my post I ever stated that that was what I actually wanted.\n3. Some of y'all are just literally so pressed about the fact that I stated that Maisie was hot. She is hot. Everyone knows that -- I know that, my girlfriend knows that, Maisie knows that, everyone who sees Maisie knows that. And, surprise, I can find girls hot without wanting to fuck them (as it has been for fucking twelve years).\n4. Thank you all for the ones hoping my girlfriend dumps me, I hope it goes back to you in some point.\n5. Thank you for the ones who made me laugh in here. So needed.\n6. Thank you for the ones who were actually helpful and not just throwing offenses at me. I also hope it goes back to you in some point.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1670697670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhzyag/aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_girlfriend/", "score": 488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

PLEASE decide what is more important to you, keeping a relationship with your girlfriend or being right about a really shitty joke. \n\nPS - the jokes were not the same and if you felt uncomfortable by what she said, the answer would have been to either talk to her about it later or take her aside and tell her you don\u2019t like it when she implies another girl is bangable (even if she\u2019s straight) THE ANSWER IS NOT to imply you are only with your girlfriend because your female friend didn\u2019t want to fuck you.

In your \u201cjoke\u201d you implied that the only reason you are with your current girlfriend is because maisie wouldn\u2019t fuck you. That implies that your girlfriend was a replacement and that you got stuck with someone else because what you really wanted didn\u2019t want you back.

You cause your girlfriend a lot of pain and heartache and probably now she\u2019s questioning if you ever even loved her or care about her.

So yes your the asshole and should apologize to your girlfriend and explain that you genuinely were just making a joke that your not interested in her romantically and that you love your girlfriend and your sorry you hurt her cause that wasn\u2019t your intention. While I agree your aloud to think other people are attractive just like she is doesnt mean that you should joke about being with other women in that manner.

OP and his girlfriend are showing their lack of maturity and/or drunken stupor with the \"joke\" - made with friends who were fine with it. \n\nHonestly, the part that makes him the asshole to me, is him doubling down.

Grow up and learn to admit when you've messed up WITHOUT ifs ands or buts. Stop deflecting, and apologize like a grown man. Honest question...is your girlfriend your friend too?

Super advice: distance yourself from Maisie long enough for your GF to gain confidence in your feelings for her and in herself. Even if it wasn't your intention, you might have really hurted her and made her feel really insecure. You will have to work to rebuild that. And your GF might get stupidly jealous a few times in the future. And now you know: that's a very very bad joke to make, it's like feeding gremlins after midnight, nothing good comes from it.

The third friend finds out that they weren't asked and was \"last\" on the list. Third friend is hurt that they weren't offered and feels left out. Their feelings are valid.
