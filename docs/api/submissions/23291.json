You are an employee who seems to be trying to do the right thing but is not really being appreciated.  Bottom line - you don't owe them.  You could go in and explain your thinking and see if they change anything, but, unfortunately, you probably have to quit to get them to take you seriously.", "NTA \n\nYou are not responsible for their incompetence or for managing their stress levels. Pregnancy or not, they don\u2019t seem to have a grasp on managing the business anyway. Do what\u2019s best for you.", "NTA - but my advice is that it's better to look for another job while you're gainfully employed instead of looking for one while you're not. \n\nHaving said that - if you need to get out of there for your own well-being, do it, and don't look back. They can find new employees.", "Nta\n\nTheir failure to plan isn't your problem, just like their inability to run a business isn't your problem. A rotating manager system where no one gets a raise, but everyone gets more responsibility is a terrible idea. \n\nLeave there and find a place thar is run by people that know how to run a business.", "NTA.\n\nYou take care of you.  I believe you are an \"employee at will\" and not a serf to their fiefdom.\n\nThey are not taking care of the business.  That is NOT your problem.  You don't owe them anything but to do your job.  They will figure it out.  They haven't hired anyone cuz they don't have to.  They just burn out their existing employees.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA, unless you\u2019re the baby-daddy you owe them nothing with regards to their pregnancy. If you think things are tight now wait until they have a new baby which will dump more into your lap to pick up the slack. \n\nYou are responsible for yourself and yourself only in this situation.

They also chose to not give you more compensation, or cross train while watering down the title, 'Manager'. You are responsible to you; your goals and future. Don't get sidetracked feeling guilty about things you do not control; their decisions, business staffing, etc. Take the good from this experience and more on.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't your responsibility to properly staff the establishment.  \n\nAnd as an employee, you definitely don't want their workload falling on you when they have that baby (coincidentally right when fall classes start).

Look at how much energy you have put into this company, and then look at how much energy they put into keeping their staff happy. You told them the problems and they ignored them. They ignored the staffing issues as well. Don't ever put a company before your mental health and personal needs. Yeah it sucks for them, but if it is too big of an issue for them they will try to come to an agreement to get you to stay.\n\n If anything this is the best time to leave and put pressure on them to treat their employees a bit better.

I hope you find a great one.", "This. It looks like they don't appreciate their employees. This could be the reason for their high employee attrition.
