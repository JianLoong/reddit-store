{"id": 2324, "submission_id": "yv6a3a", "title": "AITA for wanting my fiance's mom out of our house", "selftext": "My fiance and I have been together for almost 4 years and we plan to stay engaged for a while before we get married. He was raised by his dad and his mom has always been heavily involved with drugs. I am pregnant. On day he informed me his mom was now homeless and asked if she could stay with us. I couldn't exactly say, \"No, your mom can't stay with us she has to sleep on the streets.\" I reluctantly agreed. For her to stay with us she has to stay 100% clean and need to actively look for and get a job so she can move out. When she got here I had to deal with her going through withdrawal and everything else. My fiance works 13-14 hours a day while I work part-time and we live in the country. His mom has started to throw tantrums if I don't wanna drive to the store right then or I won't spend money on unnecessary items. She spent one day trying to apply for jobs and that was it. She did find I guy that lives an hour and a half away to start hooking up with and has been making fiance drive her to him after work. By the time he gets home he looks exhausted and I wonder how he got home safely, and he ends up stressing about her when she is gone. Once he was so tired after work that he told her she had to wait another day. She threw a huge fit and got wasted forcing him to care for her. She has been having him cook foods that makes my morning-sickness bad so I have mostly been eating toast or pizza rolls for dinner in the bedroom. Her tantrums are worse then my 6 and 2 yo half siblings. She has been here for over 3 months, I reminded her that one of the conditions of her being here is she needs to get a job. And she threw a fit about not wanting to work and wanting to go onto disability. (Unfortunately fat and lazy isn't a disability) I grabbed some stuff and went to my moms house until fiance got home from work. I've been doing often now. The other day she was begging to go back to the hook up after just getting back and was even showing signs of withdrawal again. I replied to her saying, \"Why don't you wait a couple more days since you just got back?\" She went into a full out tantrum so I went to the bedroom. My fiance came in to let me know I overstepped my boundaries. I've been going to my mom's everyday day. I told fiance I might just start staying the night there. Two days ago fiance kept me up for most the night, he was restless sleeping, just for me to be woken up at 6am to her screaming a conversation with him. I made my fiance and I have a real conversation about his mom. I hate putting him in a position where he has to choose, but I told him if she is not gone by the time this baby arrives I will be living with my mom. I can't take care of a newborn and his mother. I made it clear that I still love him but I cannot handle his mom's behavior anymore.", "created_utc": 1668446827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yv6a3a/aita_for_wanting_my_fiances_mom_out_of_our_house/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have your own baby to take care of and your comfort, safety, and sanity are the most important thing right now.", "NTA- the deal was she got clean, got a job and moved out. She's not living up to that, and she's ruining your life. \n\nIf I were you, I'd personally cancel the wedding and call the whole thing off. He clearly will side with her no matter what she does, and you cannot take care of her, him, a baby and yourself at the same time. \n\nBut that's me, and I have no problem cutting toxic people out of my life without any remorse.\n\nStay with your mum. Tell fianc\u00e9 she leaves NOW or it's all over.", "NTA. Your fiance thinks you overstepped your boundaries? What boundaries are in place for his mother? His priority has to be you and your children.", "NTA.  I think you've handled this amazingly well.  You could offer to help DH research accommodations and or therapy for him and his mum, as long as you don't have to deal with her directly.  And just generally express your empathy for him for having such a shit mum.  But the ultimatum you gave is entirely fair and reasonable.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. You\u2019re about to bring a baby into the world and by the sounds of it, it will\nNOT be a healthy environment with her around - you should make sure you clearly communicate this to your fianc\u00e9. Why isn\u2019t she in rehab? Your fianc\u00e9 accused you of overstepping boundaries - what about the boundaries she has overstepped? Has he spoken to his dad who raised him about this? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re asking him to choose as this point, I think it\u2019s more about introducing your baby into a safe and healthy environment and that will not exist as long as she\u2019s there. Please keep me posted I really hope\nyou can work it out.", "NTA \n\nHe should be prioritising you. I wouldn\u2019t fault you for leaving if nothing changes, the current situation isn\u2019t fair.", "NTA. Your child is your priority and that should be his as well.", "NTA - You and he set reasonable conditions for her living with you. It seems she has failed on all counts. Now, relapse is one thing - addiction is hard. But she is acting like an entitled brat, refusing to get a job, and bringing undue stress into your home while you are pregnant. She is a problem. \n\nHowever, your fianc\u00e9 is a bigger problem. Because he is enabling her behavior and not holding her accountable. If he wants to let her mistreat and take advantage of HIM, that is his choice. But he cannot make that choice for you. \n\nI suggest that you move out now and tell your fianc\u00e9 that you are not moving back in until his mother is gone. That does not mean he has to kick her out right away. He can help her find a job and housing (look for sober housing services). But tell him that you, and your baby if it takes that long, are no longer going to be part of that process.", "NTA. You can't raise a baby in a house with an active drug addict. You know she's using. Move out. Do you know her drug of choice? If it's meth it seeps into everything.", "NTA.  This is not a healthy environment for any of you, least of all a newborn baby.  Unfortunately, you can't control fianc\u00e9's relationship with his mother, but you can control your own circumstances and the care of your child and moving out--at least until MIL eventually self-destructs and gets kicked out--is probably the best option.  The bad timing of this (baby on the way) is not your fault, it's his.", "NTA however, you need to stop prioritizing him and his feelings and start prioritizing your baby. If he is unable to see how toxic this environment is on you currently and recognize the risk all of this stress could have for your unborn baby, he wont see it once the baby is born. And newborns are stressful enough without having to deal with your addicted FMIL. I speak from experience as both a mom myself and the child of 2 addicts.", "Another condition was she was 100% clean. She\u2019s using again with her hook up so she needs to go. It is not a home to raise kids in.", "NTA. Just because that\u2019s isn\u2019t mom doesn\u2019t mean her behavior isn\u2019t unacceptable. You have to do what\u2019s right for you and your unborn child", "NTA. Move out permanently and do not marry that guy.", "NTA. You give her mom a condici\u00f3n to live with you and she dont doit, you need peace and resto, not all this stres. \nTell him youre gonna stay with your mom until his find a place, you cannot live this way.", "NTA and this situation is not healthy for you or your child. I would tell him you'll be staying with your mom as long as his mother remains in the house as you feel unsafe. She is a drug addict and has no intention of getting or staying clean. If your partner chooses to enable her, that's his choice but you cannot bring a newborn child into that situation.", "NTA - you and your fiance need to get on the same page if you're going to stay engaged/together.\n\nI think you need to reiterate the guidelines with her.\n\n1. She needs to be clean - go get over the counter drug tests and tell her she needs to pass one every week in order to stay.  If she fails, she has 48 hours to leave.\n2. She needs to look for a job - being on disability is not an option since she's not disabled.  Set it up like unemployment, she needs to provide proof to you that she's applied for at least 5 new/different jobs each week.  If she fails, she has 48 hours to leave.\n\nI'd also consider adding an additional boundary - you and your fiance are not a taxi service.  If she would like to go meet her hookup who lives 90 minutes away, he can pick her up (he's not allowed in your home) or she can uber.  If she needs to go to the store, you will go twice a week on set days to do your shopping and she can go with you at that time.\n\nAnd above all, she needs to remember that she is a GUEST in your home.", "NTA. This is actually a very reasonable ultimatum given the circumstances", "NTA but nothing is going to change unless you force his hand. I would seriously consider moving back in with your mom now, especially since future MIL could escalate from verbal nastiness to physical assault. It's not safe for you and your tiny passenger there. \n\nI'm sorry you are dealing with this.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you were cursed with a sucky mil. It happens to the best of us.", "NTA.", "The mother broke the deal.  She had to get clean, get a job.      You are NTA.", "NTA. I'd never trust this woman around my baby. If she's not gone by the baby's arrival, please go and stay somewhere safe and peaceful.", "NTA she should go asap i wouldn't wait.\nLet her go to her hookup", "INFO:\n\n>  I couldn't exactly say, \"No, your mom can't stay with us she has to sleep on the streets.\" \n\nWhy couldn't you say 'I'm not comfortable with having her move in?'", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
