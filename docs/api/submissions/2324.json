He was raised by his dad and his mom has always been heavily involved with drugs. I am pregnant. On day he informed me his mom was now homeless and asked if she could stay with us. I couldn't exactly say, \"No, your mom can't stay with us she has to sleep on the streets.\" I reluctantly agreed. For her to stay with us she has to stay 100% clean and need to actively look for and get a job so she can move out. When she got here I had to deal with her going through withdrawal and everything else. My fiance works 13-14 hours a day while I work part-time and we live in the country. His mom has started to throw tantrums if I don't wanna drive to the store right then or I won't spend money on unnecessary items. She spent one day trying to apply for jobs and that was it. She did find I guy that lives an hour and a half away to start hooking up with and has been making fiance drive her to him after work. By the time he gets home he looks exhausted and I wonder how he got home safely, and he ends up stressing about her when she is gone. Once he was so tired after work that he told her she had to wait another day. She threw a huge fit and got wasted forcing him to care for her. She has been having him cook foods that makes my morning-sickness bad so I have mostly been eating toast or pizza rolls for dinner in the bedroom. Her tantrums are worse then my 6 and 2 yo half siblings. She has been here for over 3 months, I reminded her that one of the conditions of her being here is she needs to get a job. And she threw a fit about not wanting to work and wanting to go onto disability. (Unfortunately fat and lazy isn't a disability) I grabbed some stuff and went to my moms house until fiance got home from work. I've been doing often now. The other day she was begging to go back to the hook up after just getting back and was even showing signs of withdrawal again. I replied to her saying, \"Why don't you wait a couple more days since you just got back?\" She went into a full out tantrum so I went to the bedroom. My fiance came in to let me know I overstepped my boundaries. I've been going to my mom's everyday day. I told fiance I might just start staying the night there. Two days ago fiance kept me up for most the night, he was restless sleeping, just for me to be woken up at 6am to her screaming a conversation with him. I made my fiance and I have a real conversation about his mom. I hate putting him in a position where he has to choose, but I told him if she is not gone by the time this baby arrives I will be living with my mom. I can't take care of a newborn and his mother. I made it clear that I still love him but I cannot handle his mom's behavior anymore.", "created_utc": 1668446827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yv6a3a/aita_for_wanting_my_fiances_mom_out_of_our_house/", "score": 421, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re asking him to choose as this point, I think it\u2019s more about introducing your baby into a safe and healthy environment and that will not exist as long as she\u2019s there.

Your child is your priority and that should be his as well.", "NTA - You and he set reasonable conditions for her living with you. It seems she has failed on all counts. Now, relapse is one thing - addiction is hard. But she is acting like an entitled brat, refusing to get a job, and bringing undue stress into your home while you are pregnant. She is a problem. \n\nHowever, your fianc\u00e9 is a bigger problem. Because he is enabling her behavior and not holding her accountable. If he wants to let her mistreat and take advantage of HIM, that is his choice. But he cannot make that choice for you. \n\nI suggest that you move out now and tell your fianc\u00e9 that you are not moving back in until his mother is gone. That does not mean he has to kick her out right away. He can help her find a job and housing (look for sober housing services). But tell him that you, and your baby if it takes that long, are no longer going to be part of that process.", "NTA. You can't raise a baby in a house with an active drug addict. You know she's using.

If he is unable to see how toxic this environment is on you currently and recognize the risk all of this stress could have for your unborn baby, he wont see it once the baby is born. And newborns are stressful enough without having to deal with your addicted FMIL. I speak from experience as both a mom myself and the child of 2 addicts.", "Another condition was she was 100% clean. She\u2019s using again with her hook up so she needs to go. It is not a home to raise kids in.", "NTA. Just because that\u2019s isn\u2019t mom doesn\u2019t mean her behavior isn\u2019t unacceptable.

I would tell him you'll be staying with your mom as long as his mother remains in the house as you feel unsafe. She is a drug addict and has no intention of getting or staying clean.

She needs to be clean - go get over the counter drug tests and tell her she needs to pass one every week in order to stay.  If she fails, she has 48 hours to leave.\n2. She needs to look for a job - being on disability is not an option since she's not disabled.  Set it up like unemployment, she needs to provide proof to you that she's applied for at least 5 new/different jobs each week.  If she fails, she has 48 hours to leave.\n\nI'd also consider adding an additional boundary - you and your fiance are not a taxi service.

If she needs to go to the store, you will go twice a week on set days to do your shopping and she can go with you at that time.\n\nAnd above all, she needs to remember that she is a GUEST in your home.", "NTA.

It\u2019s not about wanting to punish the parent or cut them out of your life, boundaries are set out of love and a desire to maintain an ongoing relationship.", "YTA for allowing a drug addict to be near your children. If CPS finds out about this they will be taken away from you.", "NTA. Stay with your mum until she's gone and make sure your fianc\u00e9 is completely clear about why.", "Nta\u2026. Pack your bags now and go to your moms that woman is a danger to you and your child just by the stress she is causing you now i cannot see it getting any better then bringing a newborn into the house with that behaviour your emotions and hormones all over you do not need that", "NTA.  BF is because he is an enabler.  If he continues to let her live there, she will never kick or try to get help.  Making her leave does not guarantee recovery, but at least there is a chance.  For sure having her around a newborn is child endangerment.\n\n I see by a later comment that you have a lease.  Does the lease prohibit additional tenants not on the lease?  If so, also remind BF of that.", "As they said in the movie Poltergeist, GET OUT!!  Focus your attention and energy on baby and you!!  She\u2019s doing drugs with hook up and not getting a job?  She broke the agreement and needs to get out!  But, since you\u2019re going to be a single parent real soon if fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t do the right thing, stop worrying about it and just be safe!!  NTA", "NTA she\u2019s not living up to the deal then her side of the deal is not being upholded thus she must leave, clear cut", "I\u2019d definitely put it on hold, tell him he needs therapy and start attending Al Anon/Nar Anon and nothing will happen until he learns how to have a healthy relationship and stop enabling his mom and her destructive lifestyle", "For ME? This would be 'yep, wedding's over, my mother is coming to pack my stuff, see you in court.' But after a lifetime of awful, horrible people, I have no remorse cutting out toxic people at the first red flag.\n\nBut OP is probably not as severe as I am in that regard, so your plan works better for her."]}
