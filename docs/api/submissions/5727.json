Hes 22 but is essentially 8 years old in all prospects of mental development, maybe even younger.\n\nMy brother attends a school for those with autism, its essentially an autism, mental disability live in school that he lives in.\n\nAnyways, he lives there, so whats the problem you might ask.\n\nWell he comes home once a month. For roughly 5 days.\n\nMy mother wants me to continue this schedule after she passes and thats my issue.\n\nI have no qualms or issues with being the gaurdian in charge, making decisions, and aiding him in those manners.\n\nMy mother wants me to consistently keep this schedule as its been set for the last decade and those with autism are extremely sensitive to routines. I understand that. I do.\n\nBut this essentially means I couldnt ever move, take a lengthy vacation, and even if im sick i should be expected to still carry through with it. This also gets more complicated when you consider things like If i were to ever have kids.\n\nEven if I find a job opportunity accross the country she would expect me to either not move or make the flight every month to bring him ack.\n\nI will also add I have my own mental issues. Though ones ive worked on extensively.\n\nMy mother has also made it clear I will only be recieving life insurance money if I were to take care of him in the past, which you know...cool, but its whatever.\n\nMy issue is that once she passes im to be expected to essentially fill the mother role in ways im not sure im capable of and if im being honest, not sure I event want to.\n\nI genuinely have a life ahead of me and my own dreams and to say this would break that all would be fitting. Again, I have no issues taking the role on paper and making choices and of course I have no problem bringing him for holidays and such.\n\nThe idea if every month though is genuinely pretty much taking my life and autonomy away from me.\n\nAnd when I bring this up im immediately shut down and my mom will say how hes going to be alone and have nobody and im the only one he can rely on.\n\nI try to stress that i will do my best but that I will need to put my own life and needs first. Even bringing up the what ifs makes her cancel out the conversation and proceed to call me unreliable and demonize me. I try to stress Ill do my best, but thats not enough for my mom who wants reassurance I will dedicate my life to my autistic brother and basically put him above all else as the deciding factor of how I should make life choices like jobs and such.\n\nSo...AITA for pushing back and blatantly saying I cant promise it?", "created_utc": 1672091370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvxwoz/aita_for_not_comitting_to_caring_for_my_autistic/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That and you both will be grieving. Being a hands on carer is alot and you have your own life to live. Don\u2019t commit to this.", "I have a son like your brother and I have told my adult children I don\u2019t expect them to take care of him, I just expect them to make sure he\u2019s taken care of by someone.\n\nHere\u2019s a clue that others may not like but I strongly suggest you do: lie. Tell your mother you will do everything she wants after she\u2019s gone. \nWhen she\u2019s gone, do what you need to do for you and make sure your bother is taken care of by someone else. Pass guardianship to the state if you need to. Your mother is going to be dead. She won\u2019t know anything about what you do, but the stress from worrying you won\u2019t be there or finding the nonexistent perfect replacement won\u2019t be healthy while she is alive.", "NTA - All your feelings are valid ones. However, I will say this. You could agree to take care of your brother, knowing that this stress is likely hurting your dying mother more than her own immortality at the moment. Would it really hurt to say yes you will do this (maybe do it for a few months and then make alternate arrangements, that fit your decided on boundaries). Perhaps focus on the here and now - Your mom needs to hear that your brother will be taken care of and you are willing to ensure that your brother is taken care of - that's the bottom line and what matters. The way you choose to take care of your brother only matters when you are actually tasked with that responsibility. She doesn't need the added stress of knowing the intricate details of how you will change his care based on your boundaries in that moment, because the reality is that you can't even define that in this moment - simply put - it's impossible to map out the future right now, so I'd go with the resolution in this moment that creates the least amount of stress all around in this moment. You don't even have to stress out because you don't know what the future will hold and you are allowed to change the course of your actions as life comes at you. \n\nYou can't make arrangements right now for the rest of your life, that would be silly. You could take it one day at a time, understanding what your mothers desire is and understanding that your mother has worries beyond your ability to understand right now, because she is dying. Any added stress is unnecessary and it could help her if you listen to her wishes - write them down, take them into account and then decide how you will act when the time comes. \n\nShe also likely wants to be included in that future, and she's likely struggling to cope with the reality that she won't be in both of your futures. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I would listen to her, write down her wishes, hear her worries, calm them and let her know that you will do your very best. Try it out for a few months and then decide if it was something I could keep up with or not - if not then I would adjust my life to fit my own bandwidth in that moment, not this one.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nLet me share a couple of earlier AITA posts on this, so maybe you don't feel so alone:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vkx3zs/aita\\_for\\_not\\_wanting\\_to\\_be\\_my\\_autistic\\_brother/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vkx3zs/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_my_autistic_brother/)\n\n\r  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/l3gdcm/aita\\_for\\_refusing\\_to\\_look\\_after\\_my\\_sister/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/l3gdcm/aita_for_refusing_to_look_after_my_sister/)\n\nIt's awful when you're put in this position - live your life, it is not your responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re allowed to set boundaries and put your own life first.

I\u2019m so sorry about all of it. Can you maybe try to write her a letter?

I obviously don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like inside the mind of someone who is developmentally stunted by their autism, but I\u2019d think that it\u2019d actually be a better change for him to stay in his normal *supportive* environment and plan for you to visit. Yes schedules are important, but things are going to change with your mom undergoing chemo and when she ultimately passes (hopefully years from now). He\u2019s somewhere that\u2019s equipped to handle his disability. Even if you were to stay, there\u2019s no job that\u2019s going to let you have 5 days off a month to take care of your brother while he\u2019s home and I can\u2019t imagine he can be left unattended. \n\nI don\u2019t know what your financial situation is and I\u2019m not even asking you to disclose it, but it might be worth asking her if she\u2019d be more comfortable setting up the life insurance policy to cover his expenses. I get that it doesn\u2019t seem fair and it\u2019s probably not especially since you\u2019re having to deal with the reality of losing your mom, but maybe if she knows you don\u2019t want the money for yourself, just to cover her funeral and keeping him safe and happy it\u2019ll help. \n\nIt also couldn\u2019t hurt to reach out to a doctor/nurse/chaplain at the hospital about grief counseling for your mother. She sounds like she\u2019s really struggling with leaving your brother in particular behind", "NTA. Your brother's situation is truly tragic. But it's not your responsibility to sacrifice your life and your freedom for him.", "NTA you didn\u2019t ask to be his sibling, she made the decision to have children and they are not stand in parents. You should live your life", "NTA The reality is no one can make a promise like that.  So many things happen in life from accidents to job changes to kids that will have to take priority.  She is essentially asking you to never marry, never have kids and never become ill or die before your brother. \n\nWhat you can promise is you will do your best to make sure he is taken care of and isn't lonely, but how you do that she cannot dictate the details from the grave. Tell her that her choice is to accept what you are willing to do, or find someone else to take on the responsibility (which she won't ever find).", "NTA\n\nThere is every possibility that after your mom passes, your brother will not function well at home because a huge part of his routine will be gone. At that point, it might be\nbest for him to stay at school.\n\nPlease encourage your mother to meet with financial advisors to plan what is best for both her children. In the US, that is a Special Needs Medical Trust that can be set up to provide money for care, but that does not affect aid from the government. You could be the trustee.\n\nIs your mom leaving you her current house? That also is a huge part of your brother\u2019s routine. If the house gets sold when she dies, will your brother even accept staying in a different house?\n\nYour mom should also consult with the experts at your brother\u2019s school to see how best to help him deal with this major life change.\n\nAnd what about you? Are those five days five days in a row? What kind of job does your mother expect you to have that will allow you to take that much time off? What if you want to get married and/or have kids of your own?\n\nI know your mom\u2019s heart must be breaking, but what she is asking is not necessarily the best thing for either of you.

As heartbreaking and unfortunate as this whole situation is your brother is not your responsibility. Granted I understand when your mom gave birth she probably didn't know he was going to have these issues and she is in a very unfortunate situation as well I get all of that but she has to understand that you have a life as well and it is not fair to put your life on hold. Can you make a different compromise like instead of 5 days a month one weekend a month?", "NTA.  He is not your responsibility.  End of.", "NTA but make sure that, whatever you decide, you are clear in communicating it and stand by whatever you agreed to.  It's doubtful the insurance will be enough to allow you to spend your entire future without working, and you do not want to have to argue with employers about needing a week off every month, but weigh the pros and cons and choose the path that is best for you, and you only.", "How old is your brother? \n\nWon't he eventually graduate, or age out of the school where he currently lives?\n\nHas your mother made any arrangements for his care after he leaves school?\n\nYour brother will have to cope with change for all of his life, just as most people do.  Your mother's passing will be an enormous change for him, leaving school will be huge, adapting to new environments and new people will be something he will have to deal with.\n\nYour mother is frightened about what could happen to your brother.  She has likely seen how some children in custodial care are not well cared for because staff know there's no family checking up on them.\n\nI think you should agree to your mother's wishes to put her mind at ease, and then do your best to see that your brother gets the help and care he needs.

My great grandmother was reassured before she died, and no one was feeling like they had to take her in.  We see her often and she's loved, as well as being cared for.  You can either lie to your mom so she can die in peace or be bluntly honest.  Neither option is wrong and you shouldn't feel guilty if you chose not to take the responsibility she wants you to take.", "Or there\u2019s the alternative another poster suggested: lie to mom. I generally don\u2019t condone lying, but 1) you\u2019re right, mom\u2019s death is gonna shatter the routine so the brother is going to have to adjust to a new one anyways, and 2) it\u2019s not like mom\u2019s ever know.", "As someone on the autistic spectrum, and who has a younger brother even further on the spectrum, the lie is 100% the best way forward. You get the life insurance money and then can use some of it to get your brother better care."]}
