It's literally just a couple of moments of being arm-in-arm with someone you may or may not know well. \n\nJust my .02 worth. (edited to add a judgement).", "Ugh. I hate pairing up people in pseudo-couples. I much prefer the groom and his party already waiting at the altar (or walking down the aisle first) before anyone from the bride's party walks down the aisle.\n\nThen it doesn't matter whether you have them walk down the aisle one at a time, in pairs, or groups... Everyone recognizes that it's not an attempt to pair people into romantic relationships *and* avoids the awkwardness of people who are practically strangers having to walk arm-in-arm.\n\nBut that's not your question, is it?\n\nNo, there would be NAH if you ask your fiance's sister a question about her preferences (although I would probably phrase it along the lines of, \"Is there anyone in my bridal party that you'd prefer to be paired with? Or prefer *not* to be paired with? I'm trying to make sure everyone is comfortable...\")", "NAH\n\nI think it's sweet you're considering her feelings in this matter and aren't wanting to do anything that would upset her; it would be better to ask instead of assume.", "Just message and ask if she has a preference who she is paired with to walk down the aisle. Give the names of the options. Don\u2019t even need to mention gender.", "NAH:  But I personally don't see why you have to ask.  She's walking a few feet down an aisle with someone. Does it really matter if that person  is her sexual preference? \n\nI think you're overthinking", "nta if it was me i would appreciate the thought of being asked and not just assuming so go ask her", "NAH\n\nJust ask if she cares who she's paired with for the procession.", ">She\u2019s nice to me but we don\u2019t know each other well and she\u2019s hard to read\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9 ask, since they\u2019re siblings and have a closer relationship?", "NAH. \u201cDo you have a preference for who you are paired with for the walk down the aisle?

Just say something like: \"Who out of this list would you prefer? Is there anyone you wouldn't want to be paired with?\" \n\nThen ask the rest of that group the same questions, or just ask everybody in both parties.

You seem a little to eager to get Reddit's approval to ask, IMHO.", "YTA\n\nThis is an unnecessary question. You are pairing them to walk down the aisle not to get married lol. What is smart is to match people based on heights then let them walk down shortest to tallest and she can be matched with whoever is closest to her height\n\nETA: I think it's assholish bc you wouldn't ask your straight girlfriends this so why ask her?
