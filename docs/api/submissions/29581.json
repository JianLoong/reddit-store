{"id": 29581, "submission_id": "17fhjr0", "title": "AITA for speaking sternly to someone's unattended child that was pointing a laser near my 1 year-old's eyes?", "selftext": "The other day my wife (32F) and I (32M) took our son (1M) with us to a local pub with a beer garden after she got off work to enjoy the fall weather. Inside the bar, there's a kid (M, \\~10-12) sitting by himself at a table, messing with what appears to be laser level, projecting bright horizontal lines across the room. While waiting in line to order, he starts getting careless (or ornery, not sure which), the laser starts going onto us, and my wife politely asks him to stop. He sighs, rolls his eyes, but ultimately stops.\r\n\nTen minutes later, we're sitting outside, and I notice the green laser line hitting the wall of the patio, unfortunately right near eye level of my son sitting in the stroller. I look through the window inside, and sure enough the kid is pointing it directly out at us. Disgruntled, I walk inside, go right up to the kid and say, quite sternly but *not* yelling, \"you're pointing the laser near my baby's eyes, you need to stop it, now.\" I def wasn't polite, but I wanted him to get that he was doing something dangerous. He responds, a bit flustered, \"oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know!\" and I walk away.\r\n\nAt that point his mom (F40s), unbeknownst to me sitting about ten feet away at the bar drinking with friends, says in an annoyed tone \"um sir, it wasn't on purpose!\" Not wanting to get into it, I don't say anything and just walk out (I was already at the door by the time she said this).\r\n\nAbout 20 mins later, the mom comes out and starts tearing into me about my inappropriate tone and then my wife, who she apparently recognizes as a local teacher, saying that I/we should know better than to talk to someone else's child that way, that I'm a brute for trying to intimidate a child (not my intent, but okay), and that I should have figured out who the parent was and talked to her instead, because why would a child be at a bar alone? I tell her we'd already spoken once to him politely, and that I had no idea she was his mom because he was in fact sitting alone. She then starts yelling about how I had no right to act that way, that she and everyone else in the bar (literally just her friends and maybe the bartender, as it wasn't busy) were appalled. I point out that she had no idea we'd warned him once or that he was even pointing the laser at people in the first place, but I also apologize if I made her son feel scared/threatened. This isn't good enough, she continues yelling about \"that's no way to treat or talk to someone else's child!\" until I finally yell back.\r\r\n\nSo, AITA for talking severely to an unsupervised child who was doing something dangerous? Or is she right that there's no circumstance in which one can speak sternly with someone else's kid about their unsafe behavior?", "created_utc": 1698166749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fhjr0/aita_for_speaking_sternly_to_someones_unattended/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A similar thing happened to us (but squirt gun with water, thankfully) not too long ago.
