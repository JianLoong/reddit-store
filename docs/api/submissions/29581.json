Inside the bar, there's a kid (M, \\~10-12) sitting by himself at a table, messing with what appears to be laser level, projecting bright horizontal lines across the room. While waiting in line to order, he starts getting careless (or ornery, not sure which), the laser starts going onto us, and my wife politely asks him to stop. He sighs, rolls his eyes, but ultimately stops.\r\n\nTen minutes later, we're sitting outside, and I notice the green laser line hitting the wall of the patio, unfortunately right near eye level of my son sitting in the stroller. I look through the window inside, and sure enough the kid is pointing it directly out at us. Disgruntled, I walk inside, go right up to the kid and say, quite sternly but *not* yelling, \"you're pointing the laser near my baby's eyes, you need to stop it, now.\" I def wasn't polite, but I wanted him to get that he was doing something dangerous. He responds, a bit flustered, \"oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know!\" and I walk away.\r\n\nAt that point his mom (F40s), unbeknownst to me sitting about ten feet away at the bar drinking with friends, says in an annoyed tone \"um sir, it wasn't on purpose!\" Not wanting to get into it, I don't say anything and just walk out (I was already at the door by the time she said this).\r\n\nAbout 20 mins later, the mom comes out and starts tearing into me about my inappropriate tone and then my wife, who she apparently recognizes as a local teacher, saying that I/we should know better than to talk to someone else's child that way, that I'm a brute for trying to intimidate a child (not my intent, but okay), and that I should have figured out who the parent was and talked to her instead, because why would a child be at a bar alone? I tell her we'd already spoken once to him politely, and that I had no idea she was his mom because he was in fact sitting alone. She then starts yelling about how I had no right to act that way, that she and everyone else in the bar (literally just her friends and maybe the bartender, as it wasn't busy) were appalled. I point out that she had no idea we'd warned him once or that he was even pointing the laser at people in the first place, but I also apologize if I made her son feel scared/threatened. This isn't good enough, she continues yelling about \"that's no way to treat or talk to someone else's child!\" until I finally yell back.\r\r\n\nSo, AITA for talking severely to an unsupervised child who was doing something dangerous?

At a table behind us, a young couple was having dinner with a child I estimate to be about 7. He was loud and disrespectful.

It was a ball, about golf ball size, and it had been shot out of some kind of toy gun. My husband just sat in shock. The parents actually started laughing. I picked up my plate, with the ball on it, and walked to their table. I told the parents and the boy that all of them had behaved badly and since they had spoiled my dinner, I was going to give my dinner to them. I then took the ball and placed it in the middle of the boy's food, then I dumped part of my food on the father's plate and part of my food on the mother's plate. I went back to our table.

And for the ones on the cusp, the length of time it takes for damage to occur is longer than your blink reflex, meaning it _should_ be nearly impossible for it to cause damage.   That being said, it's trivial to get a red laser that will also burn a hole in your retina faster than your blink reflex - they're just not common in laser pointers.\n\nThe green laser pointers on the other hand, have MUCH more energy, and can usually burn a hole in your retina before you can blink.\n\nThe problem with all this is that it's perfectly possible to create eye-safe lasers of any color.  It's just expensive, so low cost laser pointer makers don't care.", "Was it actually a licensed doc, or just a guy in a van?\n\nI've had bad experiences with the latter...", "Yup!  Basically the only thing you can trust on most lasers, is that the label power rating is wrong!", "Many Breweries are family friendly. Most in my area have games and toys for kids.

Bar.\nWhere at any given point in time, one or two people could not know when to say when and create a violent situation just because they are drunk and have no self control.", "If a brewery markets as kid friendly, it's fair game.

If my kid is screwing around and I don\u2019t notice, I would not mind if someone gave them the business. I once chewed out a kid who rode his bike right into the street in front of me. I didn\u2019t call him names but I sure did convey how scared and pissed I was. He looked stunned but I\u2019m betting he pays more attention now.

You don't know that kid, and you don't want to be put in a position where your actions toward him are being questioned. Best practice is to go through the parents or the establishment.\n\nPeople online love seeing shitty kids get their just deserts, but in the real world it doesn't often work out well.", "I had that this weekend at the place I work and when the mom walks up to me and goes \"next time you have an issue speak to his mom, he's only 9!\"\nI was done, for starters, how tf am I meant to know who his mom is if she's on the other end of the shop and 2, he's 9, I have a 3 year old nephew who knows better than to do what that kid did", "I don't get these reactions at all, at a water park this ladies kid tripped me.
