Inside the bar, there's a kid (M, \\~10-12) sitting by himself at a table, messing with what appears to be laser level, projecting bright horizontal lines across the room. While waiting in line to order, he starts getting careless (or ornery, not sure which), the laser starts going onto us, and my wife politely asks him to stop. He sighs, rolls his eyes, but ultimately stops.\r\n\nTen minutes later, we're sitting outside, and I notice the green laser line hitting the wall of the patio, unfortunately right near eye level of my son sitting in the stroller. I look through the window inside, and sure enough the kid is pointing it directly out at us. Disgruntled, I walk inside, go right up to the kid and say, quite sternly but *not* yelling, \"you're pointing the laser near my baby's eyes, you need to stop it, now.\" I def wasn't polite, but I wanted him to get that he was doing something dangerous. He responds, a bit flustered, \"oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know!\" and I walk away.\r\n\nAt that point his mom (F40s), unbeknownst to me sitting about ten feet away at the bar drinking with friends, says in an annoyed tone \"um sir, it wasn't on purpose!\" Not wanting to get into it, I don't say anything and just walk out (I was already at the door by the time she said this).\r\n\nAbout 20 mins later, the mom comes out and starts tearing into me about my inappropriate tone and then my wife, who she apparently recognizes as a local teacher, saying that I/we should know better than to talk to someone else's child that way, that I'm a brute for trying to intimidate a child (not my intent, but okay), and that I should have figured out who the parent was and talked to her instead, because why would a child be at a bar alone? I tell her we'd already spoken once to him politely, and that I had no idea she was his mom because he was in fact sitting alone. She then starts yelling about how I had no right to act that way, that she and everyone else in the bar (literally just her friends and maybe the bartender, as it wasn't busy) were appalled. I point out that she had no idea we'd warned him once or that he was even pointing the laser at people in the first place, but I also apologize if I made her son feel scared/threatened. This isn't good enough, she continues yelling about \"that's no way to treat or talk to someone else's child!\" until I finally yell back.\r\r\n\nSo, AITA for talking severely to an unsupervised child who was doing something dangerous?

At a table behind us, a young couple was having dinner with a child I estimate to be about 7. He was loud and disrespectful.

I picked up my plate, with the ball on it, and walked to their table. I told the parents and the boy that all of them had behaved badly and since they had spoiled my dinner, I was going to give my dinner to them.

And they should be comforted if they are upset, while still maintaining the rule/boundary that was set.\n\n\nBut tone is super important to convey what we mean. Kids need to learn that when things are dangerous, we won't be sweetness and light, we have convey that this is serious and needs to stop immediately.\n\n\nIt teaches them that their actions can have real consequences (eg: hurting another person).\n\n\nIt teaches them what tone they should use when they're serious.\n\n\nIt teaches them all sorts of important things about the world around them.

Mind you, they all KNOW that they need to be quiet until they get to the back area as there is testing going on. This kid is going up and down the hall and in and out the door with his whistle showing off how awesome he thinks it is and I was appalled! I could see the people testing reacting to the noise, so I popped my head out of the test center door and said \"hey, let's not use the whistle inside please, I have people trying to take tests in here\"\n\nWell I guess the kid complained to his Dad because the next day I got told not to reprimand the kids anymore \ud83d\ude44 it's not shocking that they eventually lost their contract with the testing center which caused the tutoring center to go bankrupt (testing center was what paid for everything)\n\nMakes me wish I could go to the Dad's place of business with a whistle and just go off lol", "I still think about a couple who brought their little kids into the adult shoe store I was managing on a Saturday morning at the mall (so, you know, busy) and let them take all the shoes off the shelves.

I mean fuck, the one closest to me has a freaking see-saw airplane by the patio, so clearly they EXPECT kids.\n\nI agree kids don't belong at cocktail bars that cater to after work professionals or dive bars that cater to college kids... but breweries in my area tend to be open environments for people to socialize and drink a couple of beers with friends on weekends- not get plowed or hookup or party.\n\nParents with kids enjoy going to get beer with other patients with kids. So Breweries decided to market themselves as a social gathering space that serves beer and cater to that market instead of a bar for adults only. It's a lucrative model that serves a segment of the community that does not believe having kids should exclude you from all places that serve beer.\n\nThere are tons of adults only drinking establishments if you can't enjoy your beer in the presence of families with kids.", "<< I offer to take them to the head of security so he can call up the camera footage.>>     You ROCK!  (esp. if there is no footage LOL)", "Yeah, I get yelled at frequently by parents whose child runs right in front of my electric wheelchair - sometimes they yell at me when I don't even bump/hit them, I just come close to them (actually, it is usually a matter of them coming close to me). Most electric wheelchairs/mobility scooters do not have a brake, all you can do is let go of the \"forward\" button and hope you stop before you hit the person. Often the kid is walking along nicely, sees me, grins and then runs right across the front of my path like it is a game but, guess what kid, it is not a game and it will hurts both of us if I hit you or you run into me! Sometimes, I am seeing stars and want to vomit from the pain of being jerked in the wheelchair when I hit someone so I barely register the parent yelling at me. Once, it was the *dad* who decided to play \"let's run right in front of the wheelchair at the last second\" and I actually knocked him down and fell out of my chair, not because I was going that fast but because he was! The wife, kid and dad were screaming at me but thankfully, a security guard (this was at an amusement park) came over and told them to knock it off because he had seen the entire incident and clearly saw the dad look at me, think about it for a second and then decide to run in front of me. He then proceeded to call for medical help and another officer to shoo away the 'looky-lous'. I saw the family again at the ER of the local hospital - he had a broken bone in his foot and a sprained elbow. I had a broken arm, wrenched shoulder, a laceration which required stitches, and bruises all over one side of my face and body. The doctor who was treating me referred to the dad as \"the idiot who ran in front of you\" when talking to me and said he sees at least 1 injury a week from the mobility scooters at the amusement park, people just don't realize there is no brake so it is not a good idea to walk/run in front of them. If there is a family in front of me and the child/children are sort of playing with walking across my path, I will explain to the child and parents that there is no brake so the best I can do is let go of the \"forward\" button and hope to stop before a collision. Some parents are grateful for the knowledge, other parents shoot their mouths off about what they will do to me if I run over their kid. It has gotten so bad that I wear a little camera and hit 'record' when I am in crowds. Yes, it uses a lot of batteries (rechargeable) and I record for about an hour, then erase and start over as long as there have been no incidents. I do not drive my wheelchair or mobility scooter fast at all and I am very careful as I do not want to get injured, nor do I want to injure anyone else - it is a design flaw in the mobility devices.

If they don't stop I say, \"I really don't feel like cleaning up blood today,\" pause and wait for their reaction and/or reaction from the kids hopefully nearby adult.
