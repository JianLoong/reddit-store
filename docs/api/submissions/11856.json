They left behind me, my little brothers (16, 13) and my baby sister (1). While grieving their death, we also had to figure out who would take care of my baby sister. I had just finished my studies and was looking for a job, but all of my relatives were living abroad. Wanting to keep my sister close to her brothers, we decided that I should be the one to adopt her. My grandparents moved in temporarily with us to help me raise her and my brothers.\n\nMy sister already started calling my parents mama and dada, but didn't have a name for me yet. You can only imagine how surprised I was when she started calling me mama. At first I tried to correct her to use my first name, but she insisted on calling me mama. Once my grandma told me that my sister probably saw in me what she saw in my late mom, I felt so proud of myself and wanted to embrace it. So I also started referring to myself as mama next to her, and it was almost as though that nickname also altered the way I treated her to be even more maternally. She's now 10 and still refers to me as if I were her mom. She obviously knows that I'm her brother, but we've been playing this mother-daughter game for too long that I've practically become her mother. As a gesture, I also started referring to her as my daughter. I stopped caring about others' opinion on that matter long ago, I'm not questioning my masculinity or my sexual orientation, this is just an affectionate nickname. I feel proud of calling myself a mom, it's my greatest achievement in life, I've earned something that most men haven't.\n\nIt did affect my past relationships though. Some people just can't accept a straight man calling himself a mom. I've been dating my gf (27) for 2 months now, and I'm pretty sure she's the one for me already. She finds it cute that I'm comfortable with my sister/daughter calling me mom, and they get along very well. The only problem is her parents. My gf comes from a very conservative house, and she's certain that her parents wouldn't be too fond of me calling myself a mom. Now, I'm going to meet them for the first time this Saturday, and I'm sure they'll ask about my family and I want to be honest with them from the start. My gf thinks this is a bad idea and that it'll leave a very bad impression on them, and suggests to just never mention it to them because it's not that important. I don't agree with her, because sooner or later they'll find out, and I think it'd be better if I just dropped it now instead of trying to hide it. I plan on telling them, and if they don't like, then so be it, they'll have to get used to it eventually. Obviously when I'll have my own kids I'll have them call me dad.

I recommend to tell it like the story, you did above. That she started to call you mom, you tried to correct it, but it became a running joke in your family. The only thing you could do was embrace the nickname.\n\nIt's close enough to the thruth. If you start telling that you are a mom to a 10 year daughter, They could have a problem with it. This way it's just a cute story.", "Who on earth would get a bad impression on anything here? You stepped up when you were barely more than a kid yourself and took on a massive responsibility. You should be proud of yourself and your gf's parents should be proud you're with their daughter! \n\n'Mom' is one name you go by, 'Hero' should be another! NTA", "NTA! This is something between you and your daughter. Who cares what other people think when you\u2019re absolutely fine? And to be honest, anybody who is offended by you calling yourself mom has to go get psychiatric help. My whole family calls me grandma (I\u2019m a guy and certainly don\u2019t have grandkids) and there have been exactly zero people who had an issue. Anyway my advise is to run from conservative people as they often are the most hypocritical individuals out there. \u2018Shouting really loud that you\u2019re against LGBTQ+, but sneakily getting rear ended by a bear in the bushes at a local truck stop\u2019 -kind of people.", "NTA- it's something you and your sister do and probably have no plans of stopping so I see no reason to hide it. Honestly I think the story of her being raised by you and continuing to nickname you Mom is cute. If it upsets them that sounds like a them problem, they can't exactly tell you not to continue. And if your girlfriend truly isn't embarrassed by it I see no reason to hide it at all but that's just me my family is unapologetically themselves.", "NTA I'm very touched by your story and think it's wonderful that you stepped up to take care of your siblings; even more so that you've done such a great job and have such a bond with your daughter-sister. I have serious misgivings about your gf if she would expect you to hide something so special about yourself.", "Nta. First off, didnt know I was going to CRY this morning from feels, second, i would lose my marbles if people made a big deal about that. \n\nShes literally a child and its everyones way of coping with grief. I would tell them the story. And if they object, seriously fuck them. Its a child who lost their parents. I hate patriarchy. Be her mom, bro.", "NTA - it\u2019s your family. If she is going to be in your life her family is going to find out eventually. If they don\u2019t approve because of their conservative politics you can always point out that you went out of your way to keep your family together and adopt them. It\u2019s a nickname and provides comfort to a kid who lost her parents. The real question would be how your GF may respond in this situation. \n\nIs it a tad weird? Yeah. But you tried something else and she insisted you\u2019re mama. You made an effort to \u201ccorrect\u201d this already and it\u2019s clearly not going to change until she wants to change how she addresses you. If anything, it shows you listen to others and care for your family (family values are also conservative points) \n\nHonestly, this seems like a green flag as well. Could simply address this topic as \u201cI want to make my family happy\u201d and how your family Is already atypical/nontraditional due to the circumstances.", "NTA\nYou sound like a damn good mama and you earned it.\n\nYour girlfriend's parents can be as conservative as they want but at the end of the day, they haven't walked in your shoes and they have no right to judge.", "YWNBTA. \n\nIt\u2019s better to find out sooner if you\u2019ll need to drop someone then have it strung along and get more feelings.

Then they are not worth your time. \n\nI suspect your gf is actually embarrassed and worried what her parents think.", "NTA. In no way justify any of this to your GF\u2019s parents. You provided a home and love to your sibling when she was unable to care for herself, under tragic circumstances.

How dare your gf suggest you hide _your_ story?\n\nAnyone who would read/hear that story and think anything other \"what an amazing family\" is not worth your time. I know you really like this girl, but what she said is hurtful. She could try explaining it to her parents herself and save you the heartache.

No way.\n\nI really hope she changes her way of thinking and her parents are more open minded than she thinks. You seem like an awesome person. Good luck OP!", "NTA. 100 times over. You should compromise and maybe tell them on your second visit? Not that they should think of your lil sis calling you mom after the tragic loss of your parents in any other way than a sweet bond between siblings.

Your logic of \u201cI\u2019m not going to hide things forever, why start it now?\u201d Is pretty reasonable.", "NTA. both of you should just opt out of giving a shit what they think of this particular issue. just smile if they're mean.", "NTA this really touched me.Wish you guys the best", "NTA. It is your story and how you and your sister got over the loss of your parents.\n\nIt is a really nice story and unseratandable why you liked the nickname. Maybe start with those points. That you lost your parents at 22 and raised your siblings. Espetially your sister like a daughter. And that the one year old gave you the nickname 'mom'. You like it because of the reasons you mentioned here. And maybe because it has reminder of your parents in it? Like you are not her father and never wanted to be, because she had a daddy who sadly died. But you cared for her like a mommy and everyone knows, that you are not a mommy by biology - so it doesn't take that aspect away from your late mother?", "NTA!!! This made me tear up. If they have hearts they won\u2019t be weirded out. You have nothing to hide. Bless you for stepping up.", "I guess I don\u2019t understand what the big deal is?  I come from a pretty conservative background and I can\u2019t think of anyone who would have been upset by this.  Would they have teased you for it? Absolutely.  But it sounds like that wouldn\u2019t bother you so who cares?  To me it\u2019s super weird that she would make a big deal about it.  The only thing I can think of is maybe you make it weird by talking about it/bringing it up in a weird way or more often then is socially normal?  Aside from that I wouldn\u2019t worry about it if I were you.

If you want to keep it technical call yourself your sister's legal guardian and parental figure. This is what you are on paper. You can mention that she calls you mom as a nickname although you identify as a man.   \nBecause trust me, you are a good man for stepping up to the situation when it arose.   \nIf they really fall over a NICKNAME for crying out loud they can't do you, your actions and your sacrifice justice.\n\nNTA.", "Nta\n\nIts just a name.

Thank you so much for coming here and sharing it with us!\n\nNTA", "NTA. it's a bit non standard but you shouldn't have to alter this relationship you've had with your family for years just because it makes someone uncomfortable.", "NAH. But if it costs you a relationship does it matter what we think?\n\nYou are right that they will find out eventually and will have to get over it. However she is right that it probably won't be the best first impression. \n\nThere is a reasonable compromise between \"tell them the first time I meet them\" and \"hide it for the rest of our relationship\". Like even the second or third time would be a lot better.\n\nAlso its definitely weird even to people who aren't super conservative. Not with you being given a parental title but with you being given the one meant for women when you have always identified as a man. It would be like Tom Cruise calling himself an actress.\n\nLike, men can be loving, nurturing, wonderful parents too. It's weird that you say being called mama maybe you be more \"maternal\" which points to some gender stereotypes you hold about parents.", "NTA\n\nSingle parents often refer to themselves as both \u201cmom & dad\u201d. There\u2019s no right or wrong nicknames. If people have an issue with it, that\u2019s their issue. Your gf needs to realize it\u2019s her parents that have the problem, not you & those are her people to manage. It\u2019s their problem, let them solve it.\n\nHopefully, your sister has not experienced any negative backlash about your nickname. That would be a problem for you.", "NTA, but you might want to bear what your GF says about her parents and not spring it on them the first time you meet. If she really is your forever person, you'll have plenty of time to show her parents that side of you, so why not wait a little bit so they can get to know and love you without their conservative biases getting in the way?\n\nEdit: typo", "Your reality overrides their ideas.\n\nNta", "NAH - you need to be honest with your gf's parents, but your gf is also right to be concerned about how they react (particularly on your first visit).\n\nIntroducing yourself with 'I'm a mama' might not be the best move, but saying something (at an appropriate point in the conversation) like 'I've adopted and brought up my baby sister, she insisted on calling me 'mama' when she was 1 and it's stuck, so I call myself her mama'. That's being completely honest and gives the context that explains why you call yourself her mama. You should probably tell your gf that you'll explain this when an appropriate moment arises (e.g. if they ask if you have any siblings); if they really can't accept this, then it's better to know sooner rather than later.", "Surely the answer to this is:\n\nFirst Visit: \"I'm comfortable with kids because I had to become a parent to my younger sister when my parents died.\"\n\nThird Visit: \"My baby sister calls me 'Mom' sometimes as an inside joke.\"\n\nTenth Visit: \"Actually, my sister calls me 'Mom' a lot and I don't mind it.

This is about a relationship that involves only 2 people, you and her, and only you get to decide how it works. Also I grew up with a lot of this so it's not strange at all to me. My cousin calls our grandma \"mom\". My mom calls her dad the term for older brother in our language. My dad used the term for older sister for his grandmom. One of my friends refers to her sister as the term for older brother, even though she is a girl. Its alright, dont sweat it.

If her parents have a problem with it then they probably would have a problem with your daughter/sister. After all she\u2019s the one that gave you the name that stuck.", "I don't think you would be an asshole for it, but I'd probably listen to your GF, she's probably spent a lot of time handling her parents conservativity, so she probably has some expertise. If the topic comes up, I'd just tell them that she's your sister and adoptive daughter. If your daughter is around and refers to you as mama, I'd just act like she called you dada and if her parents bring it up just act like it's strange that they brought it up at all. It is strange tbh for them to bring it up. Her reference to you as mama because she sees you as her mom is probably the sweetest story I've ever heard, and I'd gaslight all the conservatives in the world on a whim, let alone for a legitimate reason like this. NTA but if you wanna be, it's justified.", "This is the most adorable story and NTA but I'd listen to your gf because she knows the situation and you have never met her parents. Maybe they don't need to know right upfront about a playful nickname your sister has for you. Maybe that's information you could introduce later?", "I will go against the crowd here and commit karma suicide ! \n\nI think the distinction of mom and dad is a bit narrow minded! Personally I know many parents where all the love, nurturing, care and pure parenthood came from the father, and all the neglect, abuse, trauma came from the mother! What I am trying to say is mom/dad word means absolutely nothing! There are only good parents and horrible parents. \n\nSo your sister/daughter likes to consider you a mother. This is absolutely 100% fine and good. But the word itself is not what gave you all the love and care you carry for her. It is you who are a wonderful person who have filled the role. \n\nSo, do I think if you just out of the blue went up to them and said : this is X, I am her mother! YBTA? I think you might be! It tells nothing about you other than weird. \nIf you went up to them and said: this is X, my adopted daughter. She calls me Mama, and I feel proud she thinks this way. Then you will be fine. \n\nSo I agree with your GF, no need to focus on the term and fight for it unprompted is uncalled for and don\u2019t really reflect all your hard work. Just gently explain it to them the way did for us and they will like you.", "NTA- if this is the strangest or most off-putting thing about you, they should count themselves damn lucky.", "NTA ---  The only thing I can could add to all the positive reactions that you have about this whole situation is if they are going to get butt hurt about what or how your sister calls you then that sounds like a them problem and something THEY need to work on you do you and keep doing what you are doing, you and your family are awesome.", "NTA. Don\u2019t try to hide it, explain to them how you explained just now and it\u2019ll be fine", "NTA. You did what was best and needed to help you and your siblings grieve and stay together as a family. If the gf's family doesn't like your relationship with your sister, tell them to go away. Do not let someone who is on the outside and their opinions change what is beneficial for all involved.", "NTA. If your background story leaves a very bad impression on them, they are not worth your time.\n\nI know you really like your girlfriend, but she thinks you should accommodate her misogynistic parents and that it's no big deal. It IS a big deal. You don't want that example for your sister-daughter and your future other children. There's absolutely no shame in your sister-daughter calling you mom or you calling yourself mom. Instead you should be very proud of yourself for stepping up and taking care of your siblings at such a young age while grieving your parents. And your girlfriend should have your back.", ">My gf thinks this is a bad idea and that it'll leave a very bad impression on them, and suggests to just ***never mention it to them*** ***because it's not that important.***\n\nSo I guess she doesn't see a long-term relationship with you in her future. Because if she did, she would realize her parents would be having interactions with your siblings in the future.\n\nThink about that - and maybe discuss it with the GF. Her parents don't necessarily need to know that your sister calls you \"mom\" the first time you meet them, but they should be told that you helped raise your siblings including your baby sister from the time she was a baby.", "NAH\nYour girlfriend is worried how her family will react.  Your don't want to misrepresent yourself. Both are fair, non AH behaviors.  I'd play it by ear. Don't force it, but if asked: answer. Being called Mama shouldn't bother anyone, starting a conversation with \"I'm the Mama\" might.\n\nA conservative family should appreciate that you put part of your life on hold to support your family and adopt your daughter.  They should also appreciate that you act as both a mother and father to your daughter.", "NTA. What your adopted daughter/sister calls you is between the 2 of you. However, the common term for a male parent is \u201cdad\u201d or \u201cfather\u201d or some variation on that.  What I find odd in this situation is that you identify yourself to outsiders eg your girlfriend\u2019s family, as a mom & not a dad. If I was just meeting you, I would wonder what that said about your views of the roles of mom & dad in parenting and how they differ. It gives the impression that you think being a mom is either better than being a dad or at least fundamentally different than being a dad. How so? Do you think moms are responsible for all or the majority of the heavy lifting of parenting, like you are, & dads aren\u2019t? If you have other children & identify as their dad, are you going to expect their mom to do more of the hands on child care than you do? I think conservatives would be more on board with your description of yourself as the mom, since it\u2019s a conservative view that moms are primarily responsible for taking care of kids. It\u2019s people with a more egalitarian view of life who will wonder why you don\u2019t think dads can be the primary caregiver.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A man becomes a mama. Niceee", "YWBTA. Nobody cares  about your silly little language quirks. You don't get to rewrite the English language. The term Mother is a gender term. It means a female that gives birth and/or cares for offspring.\n\nYou can go by whatever name you want. And your sister can call you whatever she likes. That doesn't change the usage of millions of other people.\n\nGreat job stepping up for your sister but you're focused on the wrong thing here. The title. You sound like a weirdo and you're going to make her parents confused with your humblebragging. Did your sister come out your vagina? Did you breastfeed her? Then why this insistence on calling yourself a mother??\n\nYou're not a mother and you never will be. Language has meaning and you don't get to subvert those meanings in other people's lives. The word Father too difficult for you? Parent?", "This.  Your sister had already lost both parents, and as a loving sibling/adoptive parent, you didn\u2019t want to add even more emotional hurt to her plate by dictating that she couldn\u2019t call you the name she wanted.", ">remember the way you tell it, might make a big difference\n\nAdding onto that, I wouldn't crowbar in the story in your haste to get it over with, OP.  If it comes up naturally, fine, but getting into nitty gritty details is a lot for a first meeting.", "I\u2019m guessing if OP says he\u2019s a mom without context it could come off as an odd joke? but so long as they have any idea about OP\u2019s situation there shouldn\u2019t be that issue", ">getting rear ended by a bear in the bushes at a local truck stop\n\nI.AM.HOWLING \ud83e\udd23", "No it isn't. Why should OP tip toe around his girlfriend's parents and their misogynistic views? Because he might upset the misogynists by not complying to their outdated ideas on men and women? There's nothing wrong with his sister-daughter calling him mom and with him referring to himself as mom.", "...wtf did I just read?", "I simply call myself mom because that's how my daughter calls me. I plan on raising my future kids the same way I raised my daughter (hopefully with making less mistakes).\n\nMy gf is mostly concerned that her parents would see me as a lesser man and thus not a good match for her, so they wouldn't support our relationship.", "> If I was just meeting you, I would wonder what that said about your views of the roles of mom & dad in parenting and how they differ.\n\nTbf, all the stuff you typed after that can be dispelled by going\n\n\"Why mum?\"\n\nAnd OP goes\n\n\"Oh she called me mama from an early age and it stuck, just a cute injoke\"\n\nAnd then it's resolved.", "There's nothing wrong with it, but I think if it's the first detail that OP's in-laws learn about him they're gonna have trouble getting over that and learning more about the type of man he is.\n\nI think his in laws will be happier with OP's sister calling him mom if they understand the context better.", "a whole lot of BS...", "Who can say? If you are concerned about your reading comprehension, this sub isn't going to help you.", "If her parents would see you as a lesser man because of the use of a three letter word, that's their problem. You shouldn't have to hide it or lie about it.\n\nIt's very funny your sister-daughter chose to call you mom when she was only a 1y.o. and it's very cute the nickname sticked. It shows that you and her have a great bond, so you did well. I think your sister-daughter calling you mom shows you're a great man (and not a lesser man).", "Oh, my reading comprehension is just fine. Your psychoanalyzing skills, however..."]}
