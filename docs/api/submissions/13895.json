{"id": 13895, "submission_id": "12ahxf9", "title": "AITA for not buying my friends son a wedding gift?", "selftext": "My friend recently phoned me and asked if I could write a letter of recommendation for her soon to be daughter in law (I worked with her in the past).  During the conversation, I asked the wedding date and was told I'm not invited.  I became offended because I figured out the bride didn't want to ask me for the letter herself because she didn't want to invite me to her wedding.  I held my tongue with my friend and told her I understood when she said the wedding was very small with only family.  \n\nThe photos showed up online and the wedding was not that small.  I even saw a mutual friend in one of the photos.  I was offended and I didn't send a gift.  I was not invited to a backyard wedding that was not even catered and the bride had her mother-in-law phone me to ask for a letter of recommendation.  She really can't use the \"budget\" excuse because the cost would have been a rented chair and a cup of punch. \n\nNow my friend is avoiding spending time with me.   It's obvious that she's offended, probably that I did not send a gift.  I was never asked for a letter of recommendation from our employer because the bride was applying for jobs she was not qualified to do.  \n\nAITA for not swooning that I understand not being invited and sending a gift anyway?  Or is she for avoiding me and acting offended? \n\nI'm feeling like I'm good enough to hire but not good enough to marry...", "created_utc": 1680522605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ahxf9/aita_for_not_buying_my_friends_son_a_wedding_gift/", "score": 59, "replies": ["NTA.

The bride should have asked you directly for her letter of recommendation. Nothing in your post indicates you are close enough to the bride to be invited to the wedding, so I'm not sure why you are offended. You aren't required to send a wedding gift to a wedding you aren't invited to. Doesn't sound like you ever needed to write that letter, which you needn't write if you don't honestly recommend her.", "NTA.  Not invited - no gift.  Pretty simple", "INFO Not enough info. You are just assuming that that's why she was offended? She never said, \"Why didn't you send a gift?\" That's so unreasonable, it seems like there is a good chance something else is happening.", "NTA\n\nIf you are not invited to a wedding, there should be no expectation of a gift.  This isn't complicated.\n\nRather than all the passive aggressive stuff, have you considered saying to your friend, \"Hey, it seems like your mad at me.  Is there something I have done?\"\n\nIf she says it's the gift, address it and say, \"I wasn't invited, so I assumed a gift was not expected.\"  My guess is they're more mad about the lost job and letter of recommendation, they probably blame you.  If that's the reason, tell her you had nothing to do with the decision.", "Why would you send a gift to a wedding you weren\u2019t invited to.

Do you even know the name of the groom? And no, a letter of recommandation is something you do for ppl you enjoyed working with but its NOT something to be traded for a wedding invite. This two things have and shouldn't have NOTHING to do with each other. \n\nWhy are you asking here if you are an AH for not sending a gift if you don't even know if its about the gift? (Spoiler, i actually think your friend is pissed bc they think you gave daughter in law a bad recommendation as a punishment for not being invited to the wedding and thats why daughter in law didn't get the job.)\n\nBottom line, get down from reddit and actually ASK your friend why she is pissed... smh.", "I\u2019m confused.

Your friend was asking you for a \"favor,\" not a \"wedding gift.\" Your friend isn't offended, they just think you're a jerk who sees everything as transactional.

There are hundreds of weddings every week you aren\u2019t invited to. Save the gifts for the invitations unless really extraordinary circumstances exist.", "INFO what dies a letter of recommendation have to do with a wedding? Are you close to these people? I know you said you're friends, but how close? Do you know the son?", "The bride does not know anything about networking.", "I think it\u2019s less about the bride and more about the friend. OP basically has two stories going on:\n\n1. OP\u2019s friend\u2019s son got married and he wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. The excuse was that it was small and no room which seemed not to be true. Sometimes PILs invite THEIR friends. But it seems that MIL didn\u2019t bother to invite OP. BUT I\u2019m not sure how close of friends they are.\n\n2. All while OP is not being invited to the wedding the FDIL is trying to leverage her FMIL to get a job recommendation from her (MILs) friend. The FDIL never asked for this recommendation directly. It also sounds like OP never gave it because well, FDIL was not qualified for the jobs she was applying too.\n\nFor issue #1 - OP held their tongue on being offended they weren\u2019t invited but the \u201cfriend \u201c (MIL) is acting like an ass (presumably) because OP did not bring a gift. In which case, NTA. You can\u2019t say you don\u2019t want someone at your wedding and then be mad they didn\u2019t get you a gift. I see that all the time in here.\n\nFor issue #2 - it seems pretty irrelevant as she wasn\u2019t qualified and it was never requested.", "How does this make OP an AH though?"]}
