When they invite me to family gatherings I would LOVE to take leftovers home, because I'm not only poor but disabled (which makes cooking difficult), and often there is a ton of yummy food left, and I know that they literally have household help doing the cooking for them.\n\nBut I do not, because it's not my food, I didn't pay for it, and they are incredibly sweet and generous to invite me and feed me in the first place. I'm not entitled to bring home containers of food after the fact.\n\nEven if I were going to ask, though, I would do that: ASK if it was okay if I took any of the leftovers home, and then let THEM tell me what they felt was appropriate, if anything. If your cousin was really, truly desperate, she should have pulled you, your mom, or your SIL aside, explained that she had to leave but the kids were at home, and asked if anyone minded fixing a small take-home container for them, that she would be really grateful for the help. \n\nWhat she did, helping herself to HUGE amounts of food that were not offered to her? Absolutely obnoxious.", "So they were just going to enable that entitled food THIEF. Because, yeah, taking food without permission is theft.\n\nShe could have just asked for left overs.

You assumed that only black people ate a certain food at bbq, not that a certain food would be at a bbq because it was prominently served in a certain geographical region.", "My point is that it is something that is not common to most white people, so my question was reasonable.", "Guess what, I live on the west cost of the US, and peach cobbler is a desert served here too.
