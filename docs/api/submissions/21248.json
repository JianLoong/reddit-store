Make sure that everyone knows they\u2019re banned. \n\nHonestly, the whole dumping food would have had me livid and charging their mom for everything wasted.", "Cousin should as of now be forever excluded from setting foot in your house. NTA op", "Especially with the circumstances after the \"drama\". She decided if she wasn't going to get a ridiculous amount of food, nobody was going to eat the food, and then to yell at the person whose event you ruined. How do you avoid drama when someone is that far gone? She's the type who would've complained that her kid hated the dessert, how dare you not finish cooking it?", "To aim it up the cousin was stealing. NTA", "I'd never presume to take home food that I brought as a guest to someone's party. It belongs to the host from the moment I walk in, whether it is consumed during the party or not. For example, I always bring wine, at minimum. If the host chooses to serve other drinks, that doesn't mean I get to take the bottle back. How some people think it's ok to take anything \"to go\" from someone else's party, unless it was explicitly offered to them, is simply beyond me.", "NTA but your cousin definitely is. The lack of consideration and the pure entitlement is gross.", "NTA\n\n> my cousin yelled at our grandma about hospitality.\n\nYou were providing food for guests, not people - even kids - who didn\u2019t come. And she tried to take HALF of the food meant for 24 people; she was trying to treat your party like a food bank. And cutting into desert before it\u2019s been served? Absolutely rude.\n\nThen she destroyed the food so if she couldn\u2019t have it, no one can?\n\nThere is no circumstance that justifies her entitlement and behavior. \n\nThe only person in the wrong here is your cousin - including for yelling at poor grandma. \n\nI\u2019d never invite that cousin again.\n\nAnd the food sure as hell wasn\u2019t that important to her since she was willing to dump it.", "Holy crap the audacity of this person, talk about having no social etiquette at all. NTA", "NTA - but is this women so desperately in need of food for her 4 children?  She might have said something politely and on the qt to one of you, perhaps she is embarrassed by her poverty , couldn't leave quality food behind knowing her child don't get to have this often.  Would you have been hostile if the 4 children had come and just eaten all around them?\n\nFor her to dump the food , ruining it was perhaps an act of desperation.  Unfortunately how she approached this was wrong on all sides, creating conflict in the family.\n\nI guess you didn't like her to start with.  If you did, you'd probably give her the benefit of the doubt or she could have said something to one of you", "NTA. Your cousin is a thief and throwing the food on the floor was a disgustingly disrespectful, spiteful and immature thing to do. I hope she isn't welcome back in your home after trying to steal half the fsmily meal and then destroying it when she was caught. Never make it easy for people like that to step all over you.", "NTA\n\nIf I were the SIL, I would\u2019ve possibly been in a near-psychotic rage for having that food wasted. The cousin wasted the food, and she decided to be dramatic and play the victim.", "NTA, all the cousin had to do was ask. It would have been reasonable to say \u201chey do you think it would be okay if I made some plates for the kids? Since I have to go to work later.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t trying to be reasonable or honest which is why she didn\u2019t ask, and snuck inside to make far more than plates for kids but took basically half the food. Cutting into desserts that haven\u2019t even been served yet that were unfinished, that\u2019s beyond rude. She was assuming she wouldn\u2019t get caught and would be out the door before anyone noticed and possibly before anyone could pinpoint that she took that much food all on her own. Her dumping the plates of food on the ground out of spite totally confirms that, if anyone sides with her I would make sure that detail is included because that\u2019s just beyond insane behavior.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin ignored basic BBQ etiquette and is playing the \"I'm a single mother card\".\n\nShe's never getting invited anywhere again.", "NTA, but your cousin is for sure. A bbq is a party not a food bank. She could have taken the leftovers home, not take half of the food before people even had a chance to eat it. Ruining the bbq for everyone else after being told no, and then yelling at your SIL for getting upset because she ruined it, makes her an even bigger AH", "Right, I don\u2019t know where this is but down south you ask and typically let the host make you a plate themselves or at least be present while you make said plate.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It would have been so easy and normal even to ask to make a couple plates. But she didn\u2019t ask on purpose, she wanted to make out like a bandit before anyone noticed.", "That phrase is the bane of my existence in basically all of my family issues. \u201cKeeping the peace\u201d has only ever meant \u201csitting in my own discomfort\u201d while I enable the same exact people to continue the same exact behaviors until the end of time.
