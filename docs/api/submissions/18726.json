The same tattoo artist did 9 out of them, including the very first tattoo that I got, back when I was 18.\n\nI like this guy a lot. He is still in university but I found him because he was a guest artist in a very respectable and well-regarded studio in my country\u2019s capitol. I believe he is in his mid-20s and I have never had a bad tattoo experience with him.\n\nHe charges relatively low and his work is always amazing. He will be opening his own studio soon and I always like to chat and catch up when I\u2019m getting a new piece. \n\nThe last few times I went to get tattooed, I tipped him 50\u20ac. Just as a small courtesy. He has given me random discounts before because I have provided him with customers (I know of at least 4 people who went to him because I recommended his work) and because I have gotten multiple tattoos in one session, meaning he only had to set the machine up once. \n\nI know this might seem like a lot but I work and earn my own money, and if I was pressed for it, I would not be getting a tattoo. So the 50\u20ac are supposed to be a nice gesture, just because I really like this dude, his work is great, and I have always felt super comfortable getting tattooed by him. \n\nMy boyfriend (M19) has gotten tattoos from this guy as well due to me recommending him. He always brings me along, and the last few times, I have brought my boyfriend to my appointments as well.\n\nLast week, my bf saw me give the artist the tip. He was quiet after we left, then asked if I had too much money to spare in a pissed-off way. I was taken aback, and then he said something weird about my tattoo artist following me back on Instagram but not following him back. My tattoo artist does not have an insane following but he clearly does not follow everyone back (think something like: 8k followers/1k following). I never thought much of it, I have been seeing this tattoo artist for almost two years after all and he always posted pictures of his work on me. \n\nI asked my bf if he was jealous, and he got even more mad, saying that I am being absolutely ridiculous even suggesting something like that. Then he said that I am financially irresponsible and how can he trust me to act right in our relationship in the future if I intend to go out and carelessly spend my money on other people. \n\nI don\u2019t see how I did anything wrong but he\u2019s not usually one to become this aggravated so I was wondering if maybe I am being ridiculous and stupid.

The tipping culture in Europe is way smaller than in the US. In Europe companies are forced to pay living salaries to their employees so 50\u20ac is a huge and unusual tip.

Can you see now why the bf was shocked if that was the case?\n\nThe way I understood what OP said, the bf is planning in being with OP in the future, maybe even in joining their money. If that is the case, it's natural that he questions OP's money management abilities if she tipped 3 days of work. Obviously, she can live in a country with high salaries and 50\u20ac is the equivalent to one day of work maybe even less (of course it depends on the country and on OP's job), but even one day of work it's a lot of money.\n\nI said it before, and I will repeat it now: it's OP's money.

I know there are people that don't do that, a lot probably, but the simplification that \"it's the same people...\" isn't valid and makes it seem that people who tip service workers won't tip, say, a plumber. Really what I'm getting at is asking to please not make that kind of oversimplified comparison.

Also jealous and insecure\u2026\ud83d\ude12", "NTA.  \n\n\nThe combination of \n\n1. being rejected by the tattoist\n2. you liking him and giving him tips\n\nHas made boyfriend insecure / jealous.  DO you like tattoist out of interest? if you were really, really honest?  bf might be kind of correct if you really look into your own heart.\n\nI wouldnt think too deeply about this, other halfs often get jealous and insecure, but if BF gets even more clingy about it then you might have a problem to solve.  In an ideal world he would be confident in himself and your relationship.", "NTA and he is \ud83d\udcaf jealous and immature. This is a red flag imo, the only excuse is he is quite young.", "NTA. The tip is something that the shop can't touch, it's the artist's. You need to upgrade your BF to Ex-BF. He's overly jealous.", "NTA. Your bf is definitely jealous and seems to have some issue with how you spend YOUR money. Red flag number 1. Stick around if you wanna see the rest of his red flags.", "NTA.  Your bf is indeed jealous and controlling.  You were kind and thoughtful.  Don't second guess your kindness. Time for a new bf.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend is jealous. That's a normal amount to tip a tattoo artist. There's nothing wrong with an artist following public social media for a return customer.", "He just showed his insecurity along with some control issues.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 also you're nta", "NTA It's common to tip tattoo artists", "NTA\n\nBF is jealous\n\nBF thinks he\u2019s entitled to tell his partner how she should be spending her money \n\nThis sounds more like an immature boy. And I mean he\u2019s 19 so that\u2019s kind of on point. \n\nNot all 19 year olds are equal though and this is one that\u2019s throwing a toddler level temper tantrum. Sounds exhausting to have to deal with. \n\nHe\u2019s not a catch. Good luck OP", "Always tip your tattoo artist", "BF is *simmering* with jealousy lmao", "Considering they said euros, clearly based in Europe, I've never known anybody who has tipped their tattoo artist.", "Yeah, no one told me this. Live in US, in a big city, had no fucking clue I was supposed to tip on a tattoo.", "I guess it depends where your from. Here in Australia (where there is no tipping culture) it's not that common. If you're close to your artist you might bring them a coffee or snack to an appointment, but a cash tip is rare. \n\nArtists here tend to either set their own prices or have a shop minimum which pays a decent living wage. Tips definitely don't account for where most of their money comes from.", "Anyone who isn\u2019t American?? Take a trip outside your country some time, you might learn the rest of the world doesn\u2019t accept this ridiculous system that anyone with half a brain can tell is pushed by business owners as a means to rinse customers and make them grateful for being rinsed. If an artist or a business wants to make a certain amount, then just charge it straight up.", "In the US tipping a tattoo artist is the norm and expected. They pay usually 50% of the tattoo price to the salon owner and also have to tip out the receptionist.", "Then just charge the actual number you feel you deserve? It\u2019s insane to the rest of us how gullible Americans are with this tipping bullshit", "Americans really are a business owners wet dream. A bunch of rubes who\u2019ll accept whatever shit they\u2019re fed, up to and including subsidising companies\u2019 wages on top of the cost they\u2019re paying for a service", "There's no issue with it. I don't know where you live  but here in Australia we don't have a tipping culture - my wife got a huge piece done and the artist was incredible and also drove her home afterwards because he lived in the next suburb over and they ended up doing a 10 hour session which is huge (It wasn't weird or inappropriate in any way). Because the piece was bigger than expected and took longer than they thought, and they wouldnt accept any more money for it, we went and got a voucher from the Cafe next door for them with enough to buy for coffee for the team for the next week  and dropped it in when she showed him the tattoo once it had healed. There's nothing wrong with showing an artist you appreciated their work.", "Whether or not the tip is offered has nothing to do with the service fee. If they don't own the shops they're paying a cut to the shop too.\n\nRegardless of the cost of the tattoo, I tip my artist. My cheapest tattoo was $100 and I tipped $50, or a 50% tip. When the piece is large enough for the hourly rate, I tip 20%.\n\nOur new AC unit with installation cost us about $12k, which is a few thousand more than surrounding states averages. Every worker who worked on it at our house got tipped.", "I baked my artist a batch of vegan chocolate cupcakes as an extra thanks (she is vegan and I am not). The little things are appreciated by artists in Aus.", "Yep, Aussie here. The only time I\u2019ve tipped for a tattoo was the one I got in NYC. The artist gave me a discount (I met him through my then flatmate/tattooist) but I just paid the original price he had quoted me. He then gave me a tee from the shop. \nSo win win.\n\nAnd seeing as my tattooist in Australia is a good friend (no longer flatmate as we live in different states), her tips are spending time with me and me paying for some drinks or dinner \ud83d\ude02", "I dont always, because in europe its not as common, not expected and I cant afford it always, so I usually bring some other stuff like tea she likes or an offshoot of any of my houseplants, because we share a love for them.", "I usually bring stuff like tea my tattoo artist likes or an offshoot of one of my houseplants because we share a love for plants. I dont see anything wrong with that. It makes both of us happy and shows appreciation.", "Oh, she made enough in tips eventually, but when she first started working there, she did not in the slightest. The boss also had a habit of trying to hit on her while she was a minor though, so needless to say, the place wasn't good."]}
