The same tattoo artist did 9 out of them, including the very first tattoo that I got, back when I was 18.\n\nI like this guy a lot. He is still in university but I found him because he was a guest artist in a very respectable and well-regarded studio in my country\u2019s capitol. I believe he is in his mid-20s and I have never had a bad tattoo experience with him.\n\nHe charges relatively low and his work is always amazing. He will be opening his own studio soon and I always like to chat and catch up when I\u2019m getting a new piece. \n\nThe last few times I went to get tattooed, I tipped him 50\u20ac. Just as a small courtesy. He has given me random discounts before because I have provided him with customers (I know of at least 4 people who went to him because I recommended his work) and because I have gotten multiple tattoos in one session, meaning he only had to set the machine up once. \n\nI know this might seem like a lot but I work and earn my own money, and if I was pressed for it, I would not be getting a tattoo. So the 50\u20ac are supposed to be a nice gesture, just because I really like this dude, his work is great, and I have always felt super comfortable getting tattooed by him. \n\nMy boyfriend (M19) has gotten tattoos from this guy as well due to me recommending him. He always brings me along, and the last few times, I have brought my boyfriend to my appointments as well.\n\nLast week, my bf saw me give the artist the tip. He was quiet after we left, then asked if I had too much money to spare in a pissed-off way. I was taken aback, and then he said something weird about my tattoo artist following me back on Instagram but not following him back. My tattoo artist does not have an insane following but he clearly does not follow everyone back (think something like: 8k followers/1k following). I never thought much of it, I have been seeing this tattoo artist for almost two years after all and he always posted pictures of his work on me. \n\nI asked my bf if he was jealous, and he got even more mad, saying that I am being absolutely ridiculous even suggesting something like that. Then he said that I am financially irresponsible and how can he trust me to act right in our relationship in the future if I intend to go out and carelessly spend my money on other people. \n\nI don\u2019t see how I did anything wrong but he\u2019s not usually one to become this aggravated so I was wondering if maybe I am being ridiculous and stupid.

The tipping culture in Europe is way smaller than in the US. In Europe companies are forced to pay living salaries to their employees so 50\u20ac is a huge and unusual tip. So big that depending on the country can be the equivalent to 3 days of work (meaning that you need to work 3 days to be paid 50\u20ac).", "It depends what you are buying  and I am in UK.

Can you see now why the bf was shocked if that was the case?\n\nThe way I understood what OP said, the bf is planning in being with OP in the future, maybe even in joining their money. If that is the case, it's natural that he questions OP's money management abilities if she tipped 3 days of work. Obviously, she can live in a country with high salaries and 50\u20ac is the equivalent to one day of work maybe even less (of course it depends on the country and on OP's job), but even one day of work it's a lot of money.\n\nI said it before, and I will repeat it now: it's OP's money.
