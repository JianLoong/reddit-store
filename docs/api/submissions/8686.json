If she wanted them to be exactly the same and rigid, she should\u2019ve handled it all herself. My guess is that since you\u2019re newer, she expected you to be inexperienced enough to not have many of your own ideas yet and just go with her flow.

Great. Here is your password for the digital grades list and a key to the teachers room. Good luck.\" and that's about it. \n\nThere is a state wide curriculum but it's very broad and vague and apart from this every teacher does their own curriculum, design their own lessons, has to find their own materials and design their own work sheets completely from scratch (apart from very few subjects where we use a textbook, usually just in science and second/third/fourth language subjects). \n\nSo in other countries you get like... pre-prepared lessons and materials and your job is \"just\" to deliver it to the students and... well... teach? (sorry, I DO know it is not \"just\" but I don't know how else to phrase it.)\n\nMaybe I understood that wrong but if not: Where can I sign up? \n\nMy work load would be so much smaller if I didn't have to spend endless hours with first planning my curriculum, then planning individual lessons and then either googling existing work sheets and materials for my lessons or just design everything from scratch.

First off how would you get in trouble for something you had to teach that no one else did?

She is just so angry that I was really doubting myself.", "That's what I thought. I get having to discuss any real changes to the learning goals. Those should be discussed in the team. But I didn't think that these name changes warranted any discussion. \n\nI don't think I would have the time to discuss my work to this level!", "No, not at all! I used codes with the skill written in them with my other classes. So did the three teachers I had parallel classes with. \n\nWhen you have parallel classes you do coordinate to make sure every class has the same curriculum. That would include code names. But there is no standard for the code names. We definitely should have a standard though.", "No, you're right, it definitely works kind of the same way in my school. The ERK goals are very vague, so you get a lot of leeway. \n\nBut our department has decided that we develop new curriculums together as to make sure that the students get more or less the same learning goals independent from the teacher. \n\nThe way that you get to those learning goals is usually up to you, but in parallel classes you are expected to discuss changes you make.", "Thanks, I have polled my colleagues and they think that she overstepped her bounds.

We have ERK goals that are set by the EU. But for ESL teaching these are not very specific. So each school gets to give their own lessons to still make those goals. \n\nI did still work towards the exact same goals. I just changed the code names for the learning goals.", "I have no idea where you are from but this is absolutely not universal. In fact, in many places teachers are given latitude to personalise the curriculum and teaching style, as long as they\u2019re meeting the standards. Try not to assume everyone is from the same place you are and the way it\u2019s done there is how it\u2019s done everywhere", "That is only an issue for publicly funded schools.

I'm not a teacher, but I work in tech and I've experienced both the good and bad from those more experienced in my industry.  For whatever reason, she has chosen to over-dramatize this.  If it were me, I might reach out with a sincere attempt to understand and listen, but do it more so your other colleagues see you being the one to try to make things right.  I would be polite, but don't ever trust someone who is willing to go straight to your boss on something this small without attempting to 1st have a polite chat with you to resolve.  You can still learn from her, but just proceed with caution and be wary.", "That's what I'm saying, OP.  She's not in a supervisory role, so she shouldn't get to verbally attack you for daring to things differently than she had.

It doesn\u2019t change my rating, but I\u2019m curious of a couple things. \n\n1. Is Molly tenured already? \n\n2. How long has she been teaching the specific course that you then got put in charge of for that year?", "Unfortunately life lessons are usually learned the hard way. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this, especially considering you had such success with your students. In education, the kids\u2019 success should ultimately be the goal, but too many people let their egos get in the way. Keep putting your focus on the kids and as long as you\u2019re not breaking any rules, I would hope that your building admins will in time see that you aren\u2019t the problem here.", "Maybe her angry reaction was an inappropriate displacement of embarrassment. If her point is that you shouldn\u2019t have adapted the lessons to such an extend then clearly she dropped the ball for an entire year, which reflects very poorly on her. I\u2019d be embarrassed to make a mistake that big at work. She\u2019s TA for sure for making her mistake and negative reaction to it your problem, if that is what\u2019s happening here", "Do the codes matter to the school at all? E.g., they are formalised in the funding mandate etc.", "Yeah maybe molly should be the one teaching it then.", "Fair point, I'll try to talk to her person to person to see  if we can calm the whole situation down a bit. \n\nI do still want to learn from whoever I can while teaching, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable around her just yet.", "Thanks, I think I will talk to my team leader. I genuinely don't feel comfortable in my team after being yelled at for developing my teaching style.", "Sure, of course you can! \n\n1. We both have a permanent position, we don't really do tenure in high school here. \n\n2. She taught this first year course for three or four years I believe. That's when she developed this course.", "Thanks for the encouragement! I do enjoy teaching a lot, and I hope I continue to develop my skills. My students are really helpful, and I have never had a class that was a struggle. I think I've been lucky in that aspect, all my classes have been grand!", "No, not really. The learning goals themselves are what's important, you have to show that those work towards the ERK learning goals set by the EU. \n\nThe names are not important other than to make it easier to oversee all the learning goals for a year. (Is the emphasis too much on reading  are we practising speaking enough ect.)", "I wouldn't have anything against Molly teaching that year. We give our preferences, but the schedule is dicided higher up. \nIn my preference I said I was flexible, and would be happy to teach pretty much any course as long as it wouldn't go over the amount of hours in my contract.", "Do they normally move teachers around then, and have them teach different things over the years? Or was this situation with Molly a one-off?", "In that case she sounds very controlling over something that has no bearing and where you acted professionally and reasonably.", "Why would it matter what you called the lessons? You are the one teaching them and keeping track of them", "Yes, that's pretty standard. We get some say in it, but we mainly just get a schedule from higher up. I'm not sure why they choose to schedule us like this. I had no influence in that choice.", "I don't know, that's why I'm so confused. I think there might be something deeper that she is so mad about, but I also don't know why she's doing what she's doing. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think that these small changes should get such anger from her side."]}
