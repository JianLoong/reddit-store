This is Mexico, so it was weird that she switched to english right away to get the deets sorted out, she didn't bother asking if I spoke it, but I'm white passing and it's mentioned in my bio that I speak it so whatever.\n\nRight there, for me, that's already two red flags, I'm from Mexico where femicide is unfortunately somewhat common, so women usually try and get to know me before agreeing to a meet and scammers don't usually bother learning Spanish, on top of that the photos are looking kinda weird.\n\nWe schedule the date, she tells me she's in a neighborhood which is NOT where I'd expect a foreigner to be, it's not super dangerous as far as Mexico goes, but a foreigner has no business there. Alarm bells are ringing. Just to be sure though, I ask my friend what he thinks before the date. He also feels weird about it and asks if I have her insta? I don't, I ask for it, she gives me an insta which has been derelict for 2 years and ALL her tinder photos are badly cropped old photos from that instagram, no wonder they looked off.\n\nAt this point it's a hard stop. I ask if she's willing to meet at the restaurant instead because I'd be late otherwise, even offer to pay her uber, she says no. So then I'm just honest, telling her I'm skeeved out and that I won't pick her up unless she send me a photo of her in the street I can see on street view. This is about an hour before the date? Shit timing on my end.\n\nShe says \"lol, i get it, there's video calls, but be safe. Bye.\". Oversight on my part,I didn't think about that, never done it in my 5+ years on tinder. So I videocall, and there she is, real as rain, I tell her I'll  be on my way, but she says we should just reschedule. At this point I know I'm not getting another chance and I feel kinda shitty about it. I apologized a few minutes later, and a couple days after (today) I ask her how she is and she immediately unmatched me from tinder.", "created_utc": 1667237886, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiita4/aita_for_asking_my_tinder_date_to_take_a_selfie/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the genders were reversed i would call what you did basic research and verification. Which just goes to show you the gendered double standard.\n\nSucks it worked out this way, but dont beat yourself up for trying to avoid getting beat up (or whatever was setting off alarm bells i dont mean to overemphasize crime i just saw a chance to make a pun and ran with it lol)", "NAH. You gotta watch out for yourself and keep yourself safe, especially when meeting up with total strangers.", "NTA.  It sounded sketchy, you asked for proof you weren't being catfished.  And she declined.  Still sounds fishy to me, so good job recognizing the warning signs and looking out for your safety.", "With as many scammers as there are on the dating sites, wanting verification isn't a bad thing.\n\nI'm going to say NAH", "Info what's the problem? You got exactly what you asked", "Inactive IG with the same pics from the tinder is a massive red flag, I wouldn't even trust the video call tbh. NTA", "NTA.  Look I\u2019m female and think what you did wasn\u2019t unreasonable at all.  All signs pointed to the situation being very sketchy. Any person willing to unmatch over this either 1) had other motives or 2) is so unreasonable it\u2019s not someone you want in your life anyways. \n\nSafety should be a priority for both parties.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know about where you are but in certain areas here people have been setting up Tinder dates and stealing cars and such. If you felt something was odd you were smart to request the verification you needed to feel secure.", "NTA\n\nTrust your spidey senses - maybe you were overreacting..... or maybe you just prevented yourself from losing a kidney or your belongings?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
