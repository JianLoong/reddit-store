I'm reading \"No, no baby, that's yucky\" as a form of babytalk. Keep in mind, fellow Redditors, that the daughter is 2 years old. Mom can't really explain the situation to the daughter; she's all impulse and curiosity. Really, the only appropriate and attuned way to reach her is to do a casual, \"No, no baby, that's yucky.\" That, right there, is good parenting because it's attuned to the child's age, developmental level, and to the context. Getting all serious about it could freak the child out and in some ways be a bit traumatic. Alternatively, it sounds like mom has decided to raise the child as a vegetarian, so she's got to find a way to set a boundary around the consumption of meat.\n\nIt's kind of like how if a child is playing with a light socket at that age, you say, \"No, danger!\" Or if a child is going to touch an oven while it's on, you say, \"No, hot!\" Right? You just keep it simple and casual.\n\nNow, I'm going with NTA in this case, because I think your mom is TA here for taking your statement literally and personally. I don't see any indication here that you were personally attacking or criticizing your mom's cooking. You weren't literally saying it was yucky as an attack on her cooking skills or something like that. You were in some ways maybe implying that meat is gross, but you're a vegetarian and you're raising your daughter as one, so that all makes sense. I feel like an analogous situation might be how I really like blood sausage. Most people think it's gross. If I go out for a traditional Irish breakfast and order blood sausage, I'm not going to be personally offended if someone's child tries to reach for it and their parent says, \"No, no baby, that's yucky.\" Even if I made the blood sausage myself. It's just not a big deal. I don't expect someone who doesn't like blood sausage to think that it's going to be anything other than \"yucky\".\n\nEDIT: My example was a bit too out of the ordinary here. My mom is vegetarian. I love to cook meat. When I eat meat around her, she looks visibly disgusted. No big deal. She's a vegetarian. I love to cook. I like to send pictures of what I cook to the people I love. I don't send pictures of dishes that include meat to my mom because she's a vegetarian and, no matter how awesome the meal is, she's probably going to find it unappetizing. If I were to send a picture of a meat-containing dish to my mom, I'd expect her to say something like, \"Yummmm\" in a sarcastic tone. Makes sense because she's vegetarian and thinks that meat is gross. I don't take it personally.\n\nI really don't get why anyone is making a big deal out of this. You were talking in \"kid talk\" to a 2 year old. You weren't doing anything nefarious or malicious here.\n\nI would go with NAH, but your mom's reaction just seems inappropriate to me.
