We're not doing great financially. we don't have anything of value to sell to use the money on the surgery except my 18 year old son's car that me and his mom bought together and I eventually gave it to him to drive to college.\n\nI decided since it was in my name that I could sell it. He found out and was not happy about it. I explained the situation to him but he said it was a gift from me and his mom and I had no right to take it back and sell it. I explained again but he was having non of it. We got into a huge argument and his uncles started shaming me for taking the car saying my stepson's health issues aren't my son's responsibility.

You can\u2019t return a gift. You took advantage of your power over your son. Selling a car right out from under him is scummy, no matter what the reason. \n\nYou could\u2019ve taken out a loan for the surgery, instead of fucking over your son.", "YTA and a really bad one too I hope you get charge federal", "So why didn't you or your wife sell your cars? How is your son suppose to go to school now? Or does he have to give that up too? \n\nYTA", "So are you planning on giving your sons mom half of the money, since she paid for the car? Or are you just as cool with stealing from her as you are with your son?\n\nLook, I empathize with you. This is a tough situation. But the eat you\u2019ve chosen to get through it is telling your son that he doesn\u2019t matter. So, yeah. YTA", "Info- did you and your wife also sell both of your cars and did you sell your house or downgrade living situation for extra cash?", "YTA. I am hoping your son and his mother sue you for this. \n\nIn about 10 years when you want to know why your son no longer has contact with you look back at these post. \n\nYour son is not financially responsible for your stepson. The car was no longer yours once you gave it to your son. You showed your son he can\u2019t trust you. That your new family is more important than him. \n\nYou just torpedoed your relationship and maybe opened yourself to a world of legal problems depending on what state you live in.", "YTA. A gift is just that: a gift, which means that once it's been given to the other person, it's theirs, completely and permanently. That holds doubly true in this case because it was jointly purchased with someone else, meaning you not only took something that wasn't yours to take, you actually stole the money his mom put towards the purchase. I hope she sues you for her contribution, and you deserve losing your son, which is what's going to happen next because he has seen for himself that you aren't to be trusted with seeing to his best interests or keeping your word to him. \n\nWhen he cuts you out of his life, you just sit there and accept it. You do not get to say one damned word in protest because it will be 100% your own fault.", "YTA. It was a gift, it was not yours to sell, his mother contributed to it, and your stepsons issues are not your son's or his mother's financial burden to bare.\n\nI understand you're in a tough place with medical bills. But what you've done is theft. You're also going to destroy your relationship with your son.", "YTA.  Question.  Would you have taken and sold your step-son's car to help pay for medical care if your son needed it?  Even if that car was a gift from you and you're current wife.", "YTA!! And i won't be surprised if mom demands payment for the money she put down on that car  Or if she sues you for it. Next time do better and talk to your son before doing something behind his back, because you knew he would be upset about it and yet still did it. Don't act like the victim here. Pretty sure if you had communicated properly your son wouldn't hate you at this moment.", "YTA.\n\nA. It was a gift.\nB. You and his mom got his the car. Presumably his mom is not the same mom if your step-son.

You blew your wad on the first surgery and were financially wiped out when he needed the second surgery, so you needed to take the car you had bought for your oldest. It is a shitty situation all around.\n\nYour oldest son has every right to be pissed, and you should realize that. After the surgery, you and your wife need to replace that car as soon as you can to try to salvage that relationship.", "I feel for you and your stepson, but YTA. It was not yours to sell, especially without discussing it first. I\u2019d be surprised if he ever forgives you.", "YTA.... in what world are you NOT the AH...??? Your ex should be suing you and your son if going NC very shortly.... What a total AH....", "YTA. It\u2019s not your car, you gifted it and you didn\u2019t pay for it all to begin with.

This is a conversation that should have occurred BEFORE you sold the car, not afterward", "YTA\n\nThe car wasn\u2019t just a gift from you, it was from his mother too. You could have sold other things, maybe things that actually belong to you and your wife, not your son.

Go into debt like every other American.", "YTA you and his mum paid for it. That money isn't all yours and further: it was a gift. Parents like you are always the ones wondering why their child doesn't speak to them in the future", "YTA. He\u2019s using it to drive to college if I understand things correctly or will very soon. Not only this, HIS mom is the one who helped you buy it\u2014not your wife. \nYes, it\u2019s in your name but this seems like it\u2019s really going to hurt your relationship with your son because you\u2019re favoring his stepbrother over him.", "So you must have sold all the jewelry you and your wife have and electronics,  cut back on streaming services,  stopped going out to eat and buying coffee and sold your cars right? Then when you sold his car you paid your ex back for her half of the car,  if not YTA", "Was the car legally yours? On paper, sure. BUT! You did NOT pay for it by yourself, it was a joint purchase between you and your son's bio mom, for him to use for transportation/college. You had absolutely NO RIGHT whatsoever to sell that car without talking to your son or your ex-wife. Depending on what state you are in, your ex-wife could sue your pants off for it. So could your son. Despite the fact that it was in your name. Because, who paid for the insurance, gas, oil and upkeep? Did/do you owe any back child support? Do you owe any kind of educational contributions as per the original divorce decree? How about carrying health insurance on your son as per the original divorce decree? Have you been meeting all legal support obligations per the original divorce decree? Because if you have not, even one little smidge, and your ex and your son decide to take you to court, you have a very good chance of having your goose well and truly cooked by a judgement in their favor against you.\n\nMy question would be why didn't you talk to the hospital where the surgery was going to be performed? Most hospitals do have hardship programs that you can apply for, at least the ones in the US do. Are you in the States? If so, the first place you should have been going to was the financial aid officer of the hospital to see if you could qualify for payment arrangements or some kind of hardship assistance. Most have them. There's a hospital in our area that has a very, very wealthy benefactor who sponsors a hardship program; I have had to apply for it for a couple of surgeries. The process was tedious and I had to provide a crap ton of financial background, proof of income and the like, but, I qualified. Knocked a 15K copay down to less than 1k.\n\nYou had options. You just chose the path of least resistance. \n\nBe prepared for the consequences.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, not necessarily for selling the car, but for apparently doing it without any discussion. Surgery for a family member is a valid emergency but just going off and making that decision is kind of messed up. You could have at least gone to him and his mom and asked them to buy it or something (assuming whatever your ex already paid into it went towards it as well). This was a messy choice that probably made rough time that much worse for everyone. Sorry about the sick kid, hope the surgery goes well.\n\nIt's going to take some effort to make this up to your son though.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nDo you plan to give your ex wife her investment in the car back after you sell it? Also, your son is 18, why is the car still in your name? This is not a solo decision you can make. One, mom paid for part of the vehicle. Two, the vehicle is your son's vehicle and was a gift. It should already be in his name. Three, you are creating resentment and strife in your family. There are charitable foundations, state medical and other options to pay for the surgery that don't involve stealing from your child.\n\nINFO: Why not sell your car? Or your wife's?", "INFO: Do you want a future relationship with your biological son?  \n\n He's now an adult who controls who is and isnt in his life. You should have respected him as an adult and talked to him about a decision that would impact him BEFORE selling the car. Instead you sent him the message how little you care about him!", "YTA. And you owe half of the money from the sale to your ex. Bad decision, is going to lead to bad consequences for you.", "It was a gift. It should have stayed as such so YTA, especially as he needs it for college. Having said that, it\u2019s of fucking shitty that people have to go into debt and sell their children\u2019s cars just to stay get medical help. Most hospitals will have financial plans to help pay this off over time, have you looked into that?", "It was a gift from your ex and you to your son.

You are forcing one son to pay for the medical treatment of the other - but that isn't his job.", "YTA.

He found out and was not happy about it. I explained the situation to him but he said it was a gift from me and his mom and I had no right to take it back and sell it. I explained again but he was having non of it. We got into a huge argument and his uncles started shaming me for taking the car saying my stepson's health issues aren't my son's responsibility.
