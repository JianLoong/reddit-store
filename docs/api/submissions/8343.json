She's probably already anxious over the expense of the trip.", "NAH\n\nAs others have mentioned, this was more for you than her and that\u2019s fine. But phrase it that way. \u201c I was dredding the thought of sitting in couch on such a long flight and wanted to treat us (me) to business class on the outbound. When I saw the price, I jumped on it\u201d\nShe isn\u2019t viewing this as a treat, it\u2019s a burden. \n\nYour partner may be worried that in the future things you want, you\u2019ll spend money and \u201csurprise\u201d her with the treat.\nMore expensive computer, larger tv, expensive chair, etc\u2026. It may not just be about the trip. It may be about how you both approach money and maybe it is just about the trip.\n\nDid one of her parents spend foolishly and the family did without? \n\nThe home and day to living may be more important to her than luxury travel. Doesn\u2019t mean your wrong, but it is something you both need to figure out how to approach in the future.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what friends think, the two of you need to talk about this and hopefully come to a better place. The friends all loving the idea puts her in the situation of being wrong. \n\nEnjoy the trip.", "You two have different understandings on money and that is painfully obvious. \n\nTo her it wasn\u2019t needed and a waste. To you it\u2019s a nice treat.\n\nY\u2019all are at two different stages on dealing with money. NAH\n\nYou for doing the upgrade and nor her for the reaction as it relates to her life experience with money.\n\nFor reference to the stock market, things are just on sale, it\u2019s not horrible.", "NAH. It doesn't sound like this was a treat for her, it was a treat for yourself. \n\nShe has made it clear that she doesn't care about better seats, and that she doesn't think it's a wise way to spend money. No part of this is for her enjoyment. If she is going to be stressed out about the waste of money, she isn't going to enjoy the better seats, and it will probably make her experience worse. So your treat to her is that you're making her uncomfortable. \n\nYou, on the other hand, love the better seats and will have a better time because of them (or, at least, you would if it wasn't ruining the experience for your partner). \n\nPerhaps if you framed this more as a treat for yourself, rather than a treat for the both of you, it might have gone across a little better. Trying to frame it as a nice surprise for her just makes it worse. \n\n>I make slightly more than her, I'm a software engineer and have decent savings and have excellent job security.

She owns her apartment and has good savings, and we are indeed saving for a bigger place to start a family soon.\n\nYou say that she owns her apartment and you have good savings. Does she own it outright, or does she have a mortgage? Do you live with her there (and, if so, do you pay to live there)? Do you have your own property? Or is what you have in your savings what you plan to contribute to your next joint property? How close to those savings goals are you both?", "No good deed goes unpunished. I did the same thing with my wife and she was excited when we got to the airport to see we were in first class for a 12 hour flight.", "INFO is there something she or you isn't telling you/is? If you paid for it with your own money and not your shared money it'd be pretty weird to react the way she did.", "That's a pretty decent price for an upgrade, especially for a long flight like that. My wife would appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nI think she reacted poorly to a very nice gesture/gift.\n\nThere are so many ways she could have expressed her concern about the cost other than she did. It is a lot of money, however it seems this is a treat rather than a habit of bad spending.", "I don't think it's a gift to give people things that feel like a burden. Her feelings are awfully clear ... now. But what I don't know is whether you could have figured that out beforehand. It sounds like she said she didn't care about it, but that maybe you did not know how opposed she really was. You seem like you were genuinely trying to be sweet.\n\nNAH. \n\n(FWIW, if my spouse did this, I would feel like she does. Overwhelmed and uncomfortable. But he also knows how thrifty I am, even if I \"can\" afford extras, and that I don't care about this particular luxury, so I doubt it would come up.)", "Info: are you otherwise splitting this trip, and is it stressing her out?  I HATE that feeling of being beholden to my husband regarding money, and would feel guilty about him having done that if the rest of the trip were a 50/50 and I couldn't afford that extra cost..", "nta, she needs to chill out", "Offer to downgrade *her*  ticket, (but not yours), back to steerage if she wants to save the money. (You did she didn\u2019t care about luxuries). \n\nOP, you aren\u2019t hurting for money, and the upgrade is a relatively small gesture you can well afford. She should drop the subject. NTA", "Have you discussed financial goals/ plans? \n\nPersonally I think it\u2019s a little ridiculous to surprise someone with something that doesn\u2019t mean much to them. But I don\u2019t think YTA unless that money was joint/ or discussions were had about savings/ financial goals that is now impacted.", "NTA.\n\nIf you both had a discussion on what your goal was for spending/saving/your future and you went against your agreement then she\u2019s probably a little justified for her reaction, however, as it was your money, you can do with it what you want, as long as your spending doesn\u2019t impact her (eg, you gamble and she has to pay for everything).\n\nYou did a nice thing, and she bit your head off.\n\nSit down have a chat, use lots of \u2018feeling\u2019 words, eg, I felt we could have a wonderful start to our holiday, however, I dont understand how we got to his point. Can you please let me know. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s worried about something she hasn\u2019t told you about.", "Asking your friends was the wrong move! Why do people go outside the relationship and bring people into issues that can make things worse in the long run? YTA for telling your friends, NTA for upgrading the tickets. Soft YTA for approaching it with her as a surprise gift knowing she wasn\u2019t interested in it. You should have framed it from the beginning as something that was important to you and you were gifting it to yourself.", "It is a lovely surprise\u2026 was she upset as it meant less money towards your long term goal of starting a family and buying a bigger house?", "If you truly didn\u2019t know how much the upgrade would stress her out, then you made a gesture in good faith and it\u2019s not an AH move. NTA.", "I feel like the reason she called out had very little to do with business class and more with some general anxiety around money. I cannot comment on that, there is no information. I'm leaning a bit towards YTA though because you knew you were the only one who cares about business class and because I find it unlikely that you did not know about her difficult relationship with money.", "NTA. You tried to do something good. Could it be that the fall in the value of her stocks is somehow making her feel insecure.", "NTA  \n\nStocks are a luxury aswell. \n\nThis was a kind gesture on your part.", "The most expensive flights we took were what you paid just to upgrade \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05\n\nIf you don\u2019t have anything else to buy with that money, I could understand. \nBeing yelled at for being generous was uncalled for imo.", "NTA. I was supposed to say NAH but when you did what she told you \u2018ask your friends and if they would be happy she\u2019d apologise\u2019 but she didn\u2019t. \n\nI get having financial anxiety, honestly. As someone who had been irresponsible with money because of my clinical depression (mania makes you impulsive) and had witnessed first hand how alarming some relatives are entitled to your money, it really makes me anxious when I am put in a financial spot that pressures me to spend more money than I have over something that shouldn\u2019t be the case. \n\nBut, seeing as it was something both of you could benefit, in which both of you had expressed interest in, she should have been grateful for the gesture. As said in your post you are responsible with your money and so is she and that you paid using your money, so she shouldn\u2019t have acted that way. \n\nI feel like there must be something psychological going on, and by that she has irrational fears towards money being spent. If you have budgeted your money and everything is accounted for, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Would also like to comment that maybe there\u2019s something going on behind her finances also that\u2019s why she reacted aggressively? I viewed it that way because you have mentioned that her stocks are bad, though might be for long term investments and not day-trading.", "NTA It was a very thoughtful and nice surprise. If you don\u2019t share finances, aren\u2019t in debt, then it\u2019s perfectly fine to do what you did. She completely overreacted and sounds like some underlying issues on her part.", "NTA, technically, but definitely not smart. \n\nYou could have enjoyed that money while actually on your vacation... instead, you basically lit it on fire for a couple of hours with extra leg room. I'd be upset if my spouse was that bad with money, too. I'd honestly be considering in her shoes if the relationship would work long term. Bad investments are still investments, airline upgrades are peak waste.", "NTA\n\nIf she comes from a \u201chumble\u201d background she might have dealt with money issues in her family that you didn\u2019t. This sounds like trauma expressing itself, not a normal reaction at all. Talk to her and try to find out why she\u2019s really upset.", "NTA....but you need to ask yourself if you are willing to put up with this sort of crap for the rest of your life anytime you do something she doesn't want....even if what you are doing is completely reasonable.", "If I was in your wife's position, then there's one other reason I would be cross about the upgrade - which is the extra environmental cost. A business class seat taking up that extra room in a plane has a higher carbon footprint than economy class. Not as bad as first class and far, far less bad than a private jet, but worse than economy.\n\nSo if I was already feeling guilty about harming the environment with damage caused by a long-haul flight, to find I'd been upgraded to a seat which made me feel more guilty and did not harm, then I'd be cross.\n\nI suspect it's unlikely to be the case in your situation since she didn't mention it, but I guess possible she felt embarrassed enough not to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Financial anxiety seems to be the main takeaway from this, I should talk to her more about this.", "Very very helpful insight. I didn't think about that, that it might be an indication of my future spending rather than my past spending.

I agree with the NAH votes.\n\n> I think I need to have a sit down and talk to her about our future financial goals and show her that I can contribute to those goals and ease her anxiety. \n\nDuring this talk, you might want to specifically speak about a \"spending limit\" for any impulse purchases. The amount can be whatever you both agree to, but the important thing is that for any purchases above that amount you'll each talk to the other person and get their opinion on the expense. That does mean no big surprise purchases, but the trade-off of knowing you're on the same financial page might be worth it. \n\nAlso, for the immediate issue of the flight seats, she may feel better about them once she understands you aren't inclined to spend that way regularly going forward. It will likely be above the spending limit amount going forward which means it'll be a discussion next time, and the upgrade is a treat to you so it won't be something you expect to spend every time you travel.\n\nYou both seem like reasonable people so it sounds like you'll be able to work all of this out :)", "I mean this could also have something to do with HER stocks failing.", "She wanted to be in business class with her partner, not alone. \n\nIf your partner makes it clear that they have no interest in beef, it doesn't matter how fancy a steakhouse you offer to take them to, you'd still be trying to treat them to a plate of something they don't want.

This isn't a tv commercial where you can get away with a surprise car with a big red bow on it. And while it's \"Just 2k now\", if it's not addressed now, it's a surprise loan for a vehicle you didn't ask for in the future. \n\nSure, she could have been nicer about it, but the action itself in the context of a long term relationship is not as nice as it appears at first glance.", "I mean, I don't think empathy and accommodation end because someone has different financial values and potential trauma? OP herself stated that her girlfriend comes from a \"more humble\" background, although they do well for themselves now. My question- what does humble mean exactly? Because it sounds like it's still impacting her and OP acknowledges that herself. (EDIT: just saw OP's gf had a financially irresponsible partner, which could be traumatic on it's own, let alone potentially magnifying preexisting issues.)\n\nI come from a poor background- not 'regularly going hungry' or 'homeless' poor, but 'if anything goes wrong and we don't get our shit together within a month we will be going hungry' poor. Despite that, and with my parents trying (and failing) to hide our financial situation from me, I grew up with a *lot* of anxiety and guilt around money.\n\nI've worked very hard on teaching myself it is okay to splurge on things or buy nice things for myself, but even then there are things that I know I will never be okay with or be comfortable splurging on. A 900$ seat for a 10 hour flight would be one of those things. In my mind, it's still my first instinct to go \"that could be a month of rent, or my grocery budget for about 5 months, that's x hours of work at my job- that's some people's whole paycheck, that's 30 gas refills for my car. All that just on being more comfortable for less than half a day?

OP, presumably, would have no rights to the house in the event they split up, nor would he get what he\u2019s paid back.

I would see that very differently if she was paying equally into the mortgage. \n\nAlso, no one ever gets what they've paid into a mortgage back.

She wouldn't be coming out any better, as, if she had charged him more, that money would be in her account/share of the property.

But that doesn't mean that she is actually doing this for her partner. She made an expensive decision for herself, and tried to play it off as a thoughtful surprise to someone who had made it clear they weren't interested. She wants praise for a gift to herself. I voted NAH, but I could have gone ESH too. I decided to be more generous to them both.", ">Op also mentioned she's lost a lot of money on stocks, stocks are aluxury purchase. She had no issues with that luxury purchase, but yourpartner wanting to spoil you with an upgraded seat on a 10+ hr flight iswhere you draw the line?\n\nHere's the thing about trauma, is that it's not always rational. And yes, incidents are far less likely to be triggering when it's your own decision/you have some control over the situation. Further, I don't consider stocks a luxury in the traditional sense of it being extravagant/self-indulgent. A luxury in that not everyone can afford it, sure- but it's an investment assuming you know what you're doing and are willing to eat the cost of failures, which can happen even if you do know what you're doing. Not that that's particularly relevant.\n\n>You mean to tell me, if you had the money and an upgrade to a forstclass seat was comfortably possible for you, you're really gonna guiltyourself out of doing it? Not me, I'm gonna do it and enjoy it andremember it.\n\nGuilt myself? No. But I'm not someone who particularly cares about extra comfort on public transport. The experience is uncomfortable for me no matter what, I'm not going to spend more money to be slightly less uncomfortable. It's not something I personally see enough value in to dump money into. Even if money isn't an issue, I'd like to spend it on things that make my day-to-day life better or easier. An appliance, quality clothing, nicer food, a nice meal at a restaurant every now and then.\n\n>Op and partner don't pay rent they own their apt, they both make goodmoney and a splurge like this (I'm assuming) won't be felt anywhere nearas much if they were pinching pennies every month. You've only got onelife and if you can comfortably afford an experience majority of peoplecant, you should do it every time.\n\nAgain, acknowledged that they both make good money. I think there's a balance between spending on something because you can and being rational about what is and isn't worth splurging on. I'm lucky to be in a decent position right now. If I spent on things just because I could, I wouldn't be. Again, balance- a first class trip isn't worth it to me. It is to you and OP, not to me or her partner- that's just a difference in opinion and values.\n\n>It is an investment, ita an investment into your life. The last thinganybody should be doing is laying on their death bed wondering what if Ihad just spent a little bit of the money I left my kids on myself, so Icould experience the wonder of the world and enrich my soul through myexperiences.

Again, a difference in values. That doesn't make one wrong and that also doesn't mean I guilt myself out of everything or don't know how to enjoy or invest in my life.\n\n>You would harbor guilt over someone expressing how much you mean to them by spending some extra dollars on you? That's just weird to me, Itsounds alien to me. I would only have gratitude, appreciation and loveas the feelings i would feel.\n\nYes. That's partly because of my childhood and partly my personality. Of course I would still be grateful and appreciative, but I also feel a lot of shame and guilt that I'm not worth that much money, or that the person would have to work x hours to make up the money. The \"trying and failing\" to hide our financial issues that I mentioned involved my parents not talking about finances at all because they didn't want to worry us- until they got so stressed they would blow up. It meant fights about money I could still hear across the home in my room with the door closed. My mom threatening to leave the family and go back to her country. It involved shaming for wanting to explore school curriculars because it's \"too much work,\" \"we can't afford it,\" and implications that my parents were already so tired from working that anything I wanted to do, with or without them, would be a burden. I was an accident baby and I wished I was never born because it meant my parents would be debt-free or far less in debt if they hadn't had me.\n\nAnd there's far more, but this isn't about me. In short, yes- I feel guilt when people do spend money on me because I was raised to associate money and shame. This is why I asked what exactly \"humble\" meant in regards to GF's upbringing- because some people grow up poor and don't end up harboring trauma because of it, like you. Which, I'm not shaming you for that- that's actually great, and I'm glad that you're able to enjoy the experiences and luxuries that come to you now. What I do find problematic again is your demonstrated lack of empathy. Because some people *aren't* as lucky as you and *do* have different degrees of trauma around money, for different reasons.\n\nYou can't say you're \"all for being empathetic\" and then turn around and shame someone else for their feelings regarding how \"weird and alien\" it is to you and take some strange moral high stance about how you're only appreciative to others. Your experiences are different. ***That's kind of what empathy is about.***\n\n>No she doesn't deserve empathy for a childish over reaction to herpartner spoiling her. That guilt, anxiety and fear is a bullshit excuseand her stock splurge proves that. If she really did genuinely thinkthat way, she would've never blown money on a luxury purchase likestocks, let alone without an adviser involved(which it sounds like)because she clearly had 0 clue what she was doing when she splurged onstocks.\n\nAgain, *if only* trauma were rational. Wouldn't everything be nice and easy? Using a stereotypical \"war vet\" example of PTSD just for ease of communication- maybe you drop something and it makes a huge bang. A little shocking, but you realized you dropped it and had a monent to prepare for the noise. You had some control. But another time, your partner drops something in the other room. Sure you might know that it's just you and your partner in the house, but a sudden loud bang might trigger you. And you might blow up and have trouble coming down even if your partner dropped something on accident. Because it was sudden, it *scared you*, and you had no control or preparation.\n\nDo you understand the comparison? I've spent on things and regretted it. Okay, sucks ass, beat myself up a little, learn my lesson, move on. Someone else spend a ton on me without me knowing- that has the potential to rock my world. And again, I'm in a far better place with my trauma than it seems like OP's gf seems to be. Not to mention again that high stress levels can exacerbate trauma symptoms. Maybe GF is already stressed about her stock mistake, maybe her work is stressful, maybe she already feels guilty about spending money on the vacation/trip even if she knows she's going to enjoy it- maybe maybe maybe these things compound and she can't verbalize why she blew up. Who knows? Of course, I could be way off-base, but this is a very likely possibility.\n\nTo conclude- is blowing up or acting irrationally okay behavior? No. Is it understandable? Yes. Is it something to work on? Yes. Is working on reducing triggers in general something to do? Yes. Should partner be supportive of the trauma in general? Yes. Does partner have to stay in the relationship if any part of trauma responses are too much for them and/or if their partner isn't working on improving and healing? No.\n\nBut it's pretty clear to me that OP is willing to understand and work on it for now, and partner has trauma. The question is if partner is willing to work on her trauma and responses to OP. If not, I'd consider her an AH- but we don't know that yet. Until that's known I'm not gonna call her one.", ">But it is my money, I did not lecture her when she invested a huge chunk of her savings into stocks (which are currently doing horribly).\n\nNTA. Her getting angry that you upgraded your seats and that's frivolous when you're already going on an expensive and ridiculous trip is nonsensical. Especially considering that she's losing money on poor stock choices. I understand she doesn't care about the seats but you do and you paid for them. Does she want the trip? \n\nShe doesn't get to punish you for her past boyfriend's actions, especially since he had a clear mental health issue that it doesn't appear you have. I would cancel the trip.", "NTA. You should be able to enjoy good things in life and she has the right to be economical. \nI am sorry to say that you are not compatible on a very key aspect of a relationship.", "Your wife is a huge asshole don't listen to the people defending her for your own good\n\nShe had absolutely 0 reason to be upset with your gift. Sounds like she's controlling you from the way it reads, good luck. NTA.", "Nah\n\nGo get a counsellor for her anxiety, don\u2019t worry about whose an ah. Imho", "YTA  \nMy boyfriend and I both make good salaries (both in software/engineering). I would be pissed if he did this. To me, $1800 is a large enough purchase to discuss, because we are at a stage where we see a long-term future together. Even though we \u201ccan afford it\u201d, we are not billionaires and money spent on one thing does take away from spending on something else. We are saving for a house too. When you\u2019re saving for something, that means you currently cannot afford it. You don\u2019t have extra money to throw away on things that don\u2019t make much difference in your life (unless you both agree to it). And if I was going to spend $900 treating myself, with my partner\u2019s blessing, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be on a bigger seat for a few hours either. I\u2019d buy a fancy espresso machine that would make me lattes at the press of a button, or an amazing spa day. Both of those feel more luxurious to me. If my boyfriend did this of all things \u201cto treat me\u201d, it would really show me that he doesn\u2019t know me at all.  \n  \nAlso, buying stocks is not the same thing, even if they go down in value. She is trying to increase her money and secure her financial future. A seat in an airplane will never grow in value in your portfolio, and if my boyfriend compared the two I\u2019d probably dump him, because it shows a real lack of financial literacy. I\u2019m sure you understand money though, so it feels like you\u2019re being defensive by trying to turn the tables on her and saying \u201clook you waste money too\u201d when the situations are completely different. Pointing the finger at her for buying stocks cinches the YTA decision for me", "NTA - OP I live in Sweden and work as a PM in IT so would have an idea of the money you are talking about.\n\nI would understand some reaction from your partner as you save but the yelling, crying, screaming, told go ask your friends and they agree with you but she says they are wrong is odd. So much so, that this would be a big red flag for me. \n\nShe has thrown money at stocks and if they are doing as horribly as it seems then she has no control of her accounts and too emotionally involved. She may as well burn that cash and I would bet she checks them all multiple times a day! I used to build trading software and used to successfully trade my own account which was a big help with our 15% down-payment.\n\nYour relationship in in the realms of saving together but you still have your own money, that's cool. So unless it's a monster thing, and let's be honest, if you earn what my devs dmearn, this is not that, then she is very much overreacting. Does she have the right to be upset, yes a little but this is overkill. I would say she is projecting her stock losses onto your spending and you do not need her permission to spend your money. Did she need yours to invest in stocks?\n\nTell your partner she needs to sell ALL her stocks, she has no clue what she is doing, no they won't bounce back though she will say they might! The stress of watching a stock drop is awful and multiplied by having more. Closing them will reduce her stress a lot!", "OMG, this is the text I wish I could have come up with!!!", "Exactly. And they are saving for their future. Even HAVING a kid could be very costly (having as in not making). I come from a better off background but was taught to be frugal (never cheap). it has saved my life later when I lived month to month. So OP spending money is the opposite of saving for their future. BUT I don't blame OP one bit, she tried to do a REALLY nice thing, but for her partner it could seriously be anxiety inducing. OP and partner needs to hug this one out and start communicating.\n\nEDIT: NAH", "Same here. Financial concerns and trauma aside, if you take a step back and say, \"maybe I'm wrong, we should get a second opinion,\" and then the second opinion says you are wrong... don't take another step back and blow it off and pretend you didn't just do that whole song and dance because you assumed you'd be validated.", "It's two females and saving up includes kids. That can be VERY expensive!", "They are saving up for a future kid and stuff, Even in Scandinavia that could cost a LOT of money!", "Stock investing is a normal in Scandinavia, you have to pay for having ACTUAL money in the bank, and currently we are ALL a bit depressed about the stock market, so I get the GF there.", "No blowing up and acting irrational over a seat upgrade is not understandable. Youre too lose with the term trauma \ud83e\udd71", "Stocks are not necessarily a luxury item in Scandinavia, it's often how our banks invest our savings, you can have less or more say in it. Having money IN the bank WILL cost you money", ">It's not an acceptable reaction, if you dont appreciate your partner spoiling you it doesn't justify acting like child, yelling and crying. \n\nI said \"She clearly doesn't appreciate it at that price. That's an acceptable opinion.\" Acceptable opinion, not reaction.\n\n>She bought a luxury purchase that she had no clue about and it cost her. \n\nDo you know how much it has cost her? OP said they were doing horribly, but I didn't think it was descriptive enough to be so sure that it has cost her a lot of money. Or that it's clear that she has lost enough to be feeling financially insecure. But you are convinced of that, so I'm curious as to why.\n\n>Op has stated they make more money and are in a comfortable financial situation, she has no reason to feel insecure about ops finances. \n\nOP has also stated that they live in their partner's home, pay a smaller amount towards the cost of living and are saving to buy together. The savings that OP has are intended to go towards that purchase. A purchase which is supposed to be sped along by OP not paying half the mortgage at their current residence. \n\n>Both can actually be true, op can want this for herself and also want to treat her partner to it aswell. It's not one or the other all the time, it can be both. \n\nI am aware that both can be true. And if OP had any reason to believe that her partner actually wanted the upgrade then it would actually be a treat. Knowing that she doesn't think it's worth the money, she should be aware that it isn't really a treat she'd want. \n\n>It's a freaking bear market and she's trying to pick out winners without an adviser or reasearch from the sounds of it. \n\nDid I miss a bunch of comments?", "...If someone is acting completely irrationally to something normal, there's two *major* possibilities.\n\n1- That's their personality. (And they're probably an ass.) Or:\n\n2- They have trauma or other (mental) health issues.\n\nAll the evidence in this scenario (except *one* potential point that could swing either way) points to 2. And I'm human so I certainly make mistakes, but I also hope that I'm not way off base here considering I'm studying trauma to work with people who have it. So no, I don't think I'm too loose with the word. Modern developments in and understanding of psychology, however, do point to the fact that we haven't acknowledged trauma *enough* throughout history.\n\nAnd it sounds like you're stuck in that mindset even though I tried to lay out a possibility for this scenario very simply for you. That's really unfortunate.", "Yea I said reaction for a reason.\n\nYes horribly is descriptive enough, my guess is she lost thousands. Ask op and see what she says \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThey make more than their partner, if they wanna take a bit of excess money and spoil them that's ok, nothing wrong there. I'm assuming the saving up for a bigger house is more op than their partner, that's the gist of what I got. Seems rather fair imo, they don't pay mortgage on a property their partner owns but they're saving more if the money for a bigger place for the both of them. \n\nShe's never flown upgraded, it is worth the money. Everytime! \n\nNah that's about her failure at investing, tis the season to be shorting.", "NTA. very over the top negative reaction.  R there other issues that have been perculating ?", "NTA. You got a great deal!", "NTA. I think you should have a conversation with your gf about her behavior and perspective. It seems like her \u201chumble\u201dbackground may also be bringing financial anxiety on with her. \n\nI appreciate that you wanted to surprise her, and that you seem to have a level head with your finances and a healthy perspective on how to spend and earn your money. But I also think that you are in a situation where you were raised in two very different financial environments and have slightly learned different values when it comes to spending money casually.", "I am slightly confused by this financial anxiety angle just because of her investing in stocks??. I understand that she might not want to spend on an upgrade but you do so I do not see why she had such a strong reaction. NTA imo and she isn't really either but her reaction was over the top and maybe she should figure out why she seems to think that her opinion is the only one that counts in this situation..", "Y\u2019all are ready to get married.  Look, when you\u2019re in a relationship you\u2019re constantly navigating her background and desires/fears with yours.  It never stops.  Communication is 100 percent of it.  You\u2019re always going to have disagreements, but you seem very receptive to conversation with her and neither of you seem to be taking the low road (insults, etc.).  \n\nKeep loving each other, keep talking and build an amazing future together.  What you have is really special.", "The question is, did you know she was going to react like this? If not, then NTA..", "Would she have been happier if you upgraded yours but not hers? Or should you not upgrade at all because that is what she is more comfortable with?", "Yea, we pay to have money in the bank aswell(Canada)", "Oh, thank you for that information! I'm not exactly into stocks myself but my partner is a successful investor/former day trader so I hear a lot of things through them and think I *kind of* get the jist.\n\nWhen you say that having money in the bank will cost you, do you mean that banks can invest poorly/make mistakes that will lose money, or do you mean that having money stored in the bank instead of in stocks where it can generate capital is a loss?\n\nI'm assuming the latter based off of what my partner's told me/since it would make sense to me that banks would have protections for customer assets, but I wanted to double check. If you meant something else I would love to hear more if you're willing to get into it!", "I mean that literally anything  over $30,000 you pay a fee. Every 3 months ... Which is the price of an upgrade to a kitchen. Now ask me how I know \ud83d\ude02", "And I am absolutely willing to clarify at another time, but it's almost 3 am here", "In what mindset? The mindset where some shitty relationship experience like being used as a sugar momma/daddy won't have me lashing out acting like a child at my next partner becaue they did something nice for me? I'm very happy with that mindset, I would think so little of myself if I lashed out at the people i love over a gift they got me just because I suffered through trauma brought on by a civil war, surviving a genocide and living through bombings. \n\nIf I agreed with you, I would have a life long excuse for the shitty attitude and behavior, i could act out towards others. I'd rather choose to be above that, I refuse to allow my trauma to define me let alone dictate how I act and I will happily judge the people that allow that happen to themselves because they all have the same capability to not allow their past to dictate their future. \n\nYou guys really do wanna coddle everybody"]}
