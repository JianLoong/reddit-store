She's probably already anxious over the expense of the trip.", "NAH\n\nAs others have mentioned, this was more for you than her and that\u2019s fine. But phrase it that way. \u201c I was dredding the thought of sitting in couch on such a long flight and wanted to treat us (me) to business class on the outbound. When I saw the price, I jumped on it\u201d\nShe isn\u2019t viewing this as a treat, it\u2019s a burden. \n\nYour partner may be worried that in the future things you want, you\u2019ll spend money and \u201csurprise\u201d her with the treat.\nMore expensive computer, larger tv, expensive chair, etc\u2026. It may not just be about the trip. It may be about how you both approach money and maybe it is just about the trip.\n\nDid one of her parents spend foolishly and the family did without? \n\nThe home and day to living may be more important to her than luxury travel. Doesn\u2019t mean your wrong, but it is something you both need to figure out how to approach in the future.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what friends think, the two of you need to talk about this and hopefully come to a better place. The friends all loving the idea puts her in the situation of being wrong. \n\nEnjoy the trip.", "You two have different understandings on money and that is painfully obvious. \n\nTo her it wasn\u2019t needed and a waste. To you it\u2019s a nice treat.\n\nY\u2019all are at two different stages on dealing with money. NAH\n\nYou for doing the upgrade and nor her for the reaction as it relates to her life experience with money.\n\nFor reference to the stock market, things are just on sale, it\u2019s not horrible.", "NAH. It doesn't sound like this was a treat for her, it was a treat for yourself. \n\nShe has made it clear that she doesn't care about better seats, and that she doesn't think it's a wise way to spend money. No part of this is for her enjoyment. If she is going to be stressed out about the waste of money, she isn't going to enjoy the better seats, and it will probably make her experience worse. So your treat to her is that you're making her uncomfortable. \n\nYou, on the other hand, love the better seats and will have a better time because of them (or, at least, you would if it wasn't ruining the experience for your partner). \n\nPerhaps if you framed this more as a treat for yourself, rather than a treat for the both of you, it might have gone across a little better. Trying to frame it as a nice surprise for her just makes it worse. \n\n>I make slightly more than her, I'm a software engineer and have decent savings and have excellent job security.

She owns her apartment and has good savings, and we are indeed saving for a bigger place to start a family soon.\n\nYou say that she owns her apartment and you have good savings. Does she own it outright, or does she have a mortgage? Do you live with her there (and, if so, do you pay to live there)? Do you have your own property? Or is what you have in your savings what you plan to contribute to your next joint property? How close to those savings goals are you both?", "No good deed goes unpunished. I did the same thing with my wife and she was excited when we got to the airport to see we were in first class for a 12 hour flight.", "INFO is there something she or you isn't telling you/is? If you paid for it with your own money and not your shared money it'd be pretty weird to react the way she did.", "That's a pretty decent price for an upgrade, especially for a long flight like that. My wife would appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nI think she reacted poorly to a very nice gesture/gift.\n\nThere are so many ways she could have expressed her concern about the cost other than she did. It is a lot of money, however it seems this is a treat rather than a habit of bad spending.", "I don't think it's a gift to give people things that feel like a burden. Her feelings are awfully clear ... now. But what I don't know is whether you could have figured that out beforehand. It sounds like she said she didn't care about it, but that maybe you did not know how opposed she really was. You seem like you were genuinely trying to be sweet.\n\nNAH. \n\n(FWIW, if my spouse did this, I would feel like she does. Overwhelmed and uncomfortable. But he also knows how thrifty I am, even if I \"can\" afford extras, and that I don't care about this particular luxury, so I doubt it would come up.)", "Info: are you otherwise splitting this trip, and is it stressing her out?  I HATE that feeling of being beholden to my husband regarding money, and would feel guilty about him having done that if the rest of the trip were a 50/50 and I couldn't afford that extra cost..", "nta, she needs to chill out", "Offer to downgrade *her*  ticket, (but not yours), back to steerage if she wants to save the money. (You did she didn\u2019t care about luxuries). \n\nOP, you aren\u2019t hurting for money, and the upgrade is a relatively small gesture you can well afford. She should drop the subject. NTA", "Have you discussed financial goals/ plans? \n\nPersonally I think it\u2019s a little ridiculous to surprise someone with something that doesn\u2019t mean much to them. But I don\u2019t think YTA unless that money was joint/ or discussions were had about savings/ financial goals that is now impacted.", "NTA.\n\nIf you both had a discussion on what your goal was for spending/saving/your future and you went against your agreement then she\u2019s probably a little justified for her reaction, however, as it was your money, you can do with it what you want, as long as your spending doesn\u2019t impact her (eg, you gamble and she has to pay for everything).\n\nYou did a nice thing, and she bit your head off.\n\nSit down have a chat, use lots of \u2018feeling\u2019 words, eg, I felt we could have a wonderful start to our holiday, however, I dont understand how we got to his point. Can you please let me know. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s worried about something she hasn\u2019t told you about.", "Asking your friends was the wrong move! Why do people go outside the relationship and bring people into issues that can make things worse in the long run? YTA for telling your friends, NTA for upgrading the tickets. Soft YTA for approaching it with her as a surprise gift knowing she wasn\u2019t interested in it. You should have framed it from the beginning as something that was important to you and you were gifting it to yourself.", "It is a lovely surprise\u2026 was she upset as it meant less money towards your long term goal of starting a family and buying a bigger house?", "If you truly didn\u2019t know how much the upgrade would stress her out, then you made a gesture in good faith and it\u2019s not an AH move. NTA.", "I feel like the reason she called out had very little to do with business class and more with some general anxiety around money. I cannot comment on that, there is no information. I'm leaning a bit towards YTA though because you knew you were the only one who cares about business class and because I find it unlikely that you did not know about her difficult relationship with money.", "NTA. You tried to do something good. Could it be that the fall in the value of her stocks is somehow making her feel insecure.", "NTA  \n\nStocks are a luxury aswell. \n\nThis was a kind gesture on your part.", "The most expensive flights we took were what you paid just to upgrade \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05\n\nIf you don\u2019t have anything else to buy with that money, I could understand. \nBeing yelled at for being generous was uncalled for imo.", "NTA. I was supposed to say NAH but when you did what she told you \u2018ask your friends and if they would be happy she\u2019d apologise\u2019 but she didn\u2019t. \n\nI get having financial anxiety, honestly. As someone who had been irresponsible with money because of my clinical depression (mania makes you impulsive) and had witnessed first hand how alarming some relatives are entitled to your money, it really makes me anxious when I am put in a financial spot that pressures me to spend more money than I have over something that shouldn\u2019t be the case. \n\nBut, seeing as it was something both of you could benefit, in which both of you had expressed interest in, she should have been grateful for the gesture. As said in your post you are responsible with your money and so is she and that you paid using your money, so she shouldn\u2019t have acted that way. \n\nI feel like there must be something psychological going on, and by that she has irrational fears towards money being spent. If you have budgeted your money and everything is accounted for, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Would also like to comment that maybe there\u2019s something going on behind her finances also that\u2019s why she reacted aggressively? I viewed it that way because you have mentioned that her stocks are bad, though might be for long term investments and not day-trading.", "NTA It was a very thoughtful and nice surprise. If you don\u2019t share finances, aren\u2019t in debt, then it\u2019s perfectly fine to do what you did. She completely overreacted and sounds like some underlying issues on her part.", "NTA, technically, but definitely not smart. \n\nYou could have enjoyed that money while actually on your vacation... instead, you basically lit it on fire for a couple of hours with extra leg room. I'd be upset if my spouse was that bad with money, too. I'd honestly be considering in her shoes if the relationship would work long term. Bad investments are still investments, airline upgrades are peak waste.", "NTA\n\nIf she comes from a \u201chumble\u201d background she might have dealt with money issues in her family that you didn\u2019t. This sounds like trauma expressing itself, not a normal reaction at all. Talk to her and try to find out why she\u2019s really upset.", "NTA....but you need to ask yourself if you are willing to put up with this sort of crap for the rest of your life anytime you do something she doesn't want....even if what you are doing is completely reasonable.", "If I was in your wife's position, then there's one other reason I would be cross about the upgrade - which is the extra environmental cost. A business class seat taking up that extra room in a plane has a higher carbon footprint than economy class. Not as bad as first class and far, far less bad than a private jet, but worse than economy.\n\nSo if I was already feeling guilty about harming the environment with damage caused by a long-haul flight, to find I'd been upgraded to a seat which made me feel more guilty and did not harm, then I'd be cross.\n\nI suspect it's unlikely to be the case in your situation since she didn't mention it, but I guess possible she felt embarrassed enough not to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Financial anxiety seems to be the main takeaway from this, I should talk to her more about this.", "Very very helpful insight. I didn't think about that, that it might be an indication of my future spending rather than my past spending.

I agree with the NAH votes.\n\n> I think I need to have a sit down and talk to her about our future financial goals and show her that I can contribute to those goals and ease her anxiety. \n\nDuring this talk, you might want to specifically speak about a \"spending limit\" for any impulse purchases. The amount can be whatever you both agree to, but the important thing is that for any purchases above that amount you'll each talk to the other person and get their opinion on the expense. That does mean no big surprise purchases, but the trade-off of knowing you're on the same financial page might be worth it. \n\nAlso, for the immediate issue of the flight seats, she may feel better about them once she understands you aren't inclined to spend that way regularly going forward. It will likely be above the spending limit amount going forward which means it'll be a discussion next time, and the upgrade is a treat to you so it won't be something you expect to spend every time you travel.\n\nYou both seem like reasonable people so it sounds like you'll be able to work all of this out :)", "I mean this could also have something to do with HER stocks failing.", "She wanted to be in business class with her partner, not alone. \n\nIf your partner makes it clear that they have no interest in beef, it doesn't matter how fancy a steakhouse you offer to take them to, you'd still be trying to treat them to a plate of something they don't want.

This isn't a tv commercial where you can get away with a surprise car with a big red bow on it. And while it's \"Just 2k now\", if it's not addressed now, it's a surprise loan for a vehicle you didn't ask for in the future. \n\nSure, she could have been nicer about it, but the action itself in the context of a long term relationship is not as nice as it appears at first glance.", "I mean, I don't think empathy and accommodation end because someone has different financial values and potential trauma? OP herself stated that her girlfriend comes from a \"more humble\" background, although they do well for themselves now. My question- what does humble mean exactly? Because it sounds like it's still impacting her and OP acknowledges that herself. (EDIT: just saw OP's gf had a financially irresponsible partner, which could be traumatic on it's own, let alone potentially magnifying preexisting issues.)\n\nI come from a poor background- not 'regularly going hungry' or 'homeless' poor, but 'if anything goes wrong and we don't get our shit together within a month we will be going hungry' poor. Despite that, and with my parents trying (and failing) to hide our financial situation from me, I grew up with a *lot* of anxiety and guilt around money.\n\nI've worked very hard on teaching myself it is okay to splurge on things or buy nice things for myself, but even then there are things that I know I will never be okay with or be comfortable splurging on. A 900$ seat for a 10 hour flight would be one of those things. In my mind, it's still my first instinct to go \"that could be a month of rent, or my grocery budget for about 5 months, that's x hours of work at my job- that's some people's whole paycheck, that's 30 gas refills for my car. All that just on being more comfortable for less than half a day? This isn't even something I can justify as an investment.\"\n\nNow, accepting something like that from someone else is something *I* could do, albeit I'd likely still harbor a lot of guilt about someone spending so much on me. But that's *me*, coming from a situation that could have been much worse and having been aware of and working on my issues for *years*. I don't think it's a far fetch to assume that maybe OP's gf isn't a miser or an ungrateful brat that lost her shit over nothing and wants to be coddled, but more likely someone still struggling with a lot of guilt, anxiety, and *fear*. But you don't think she deserves empathy?\n\nOP: I don't think you'll see this, but if you do, I certainly think this is a NAH situation and it's clear you were well-intentioned. That said, I think sitting down with your girlfriend and having an in depth talk about finances, how she sees them, and how she thinks her upbringing may have affected her might help you both understand each other a bit better and avoid similar situations in the future. I also think that you might poke a bit and gently push her towards therapy if she's open to it, as having somewhere to talk about and sort through her anxieties will also help her in the future regarding accepting large gifts/her financial anxiety in general. Wishing the best for the both of you.", ">Perhaps OP cared more than her girlfriend\n\nI covered that, however your earlier analogy was implying that she was against it.\n\nNot caring about those things, doesn't mean you're against them. I don't care about flying business class, however if someone upgraded our seats as a gift or nice gesture, I'd be extremely grateful. \n\nI may ask if they were sure and if they could really afford it, however I wouldn't throw a wobbly and ask them to quiz their friends about it.", "My earlier analogy: \n\n>If your partner makes it clear that they have no interest in beef, it doesn't matter how fancy a steakhouse you offer to take them to, you'd still be trying to treat them to a plate of something they don't want. Which means it isn't really a treat *for them*.\n\nI said she had no interest in it. So did she, and so did OP.", "She did have interest in, as they had a brief discussion and looked into it.", "I have had many brief discussions about things I had no interest in. A brief discussion is no indication of interest. OP ended the sentence about the brief discussion with \"- but made no commitments, she doesn't really care about these things - but I do, and think it would be nice to experience it with her.\" That doesn't suggest that she showed interest during the conversation.. It suggests the opposite."]}
