Her husband passed away in a work related accident. I won't go into much detail, but she got quite some money for his life insurance and there's some other legal issues going on and maybe she'll get more money out of it. \n\nPrior to the accident she was a SAHM but now, for obvious reasons, she needs to get a job. I don't have a regular job so I'm free most days. \n\nWell she asked me to babysit for her kids during the days, she said she'll pay me whatever I want. She said she found something that  will pay her well and she'll be able to keep their house and lifestyle and save the other money for her kid's future/ emergencies. I told her that I dont want to be a babysitter and to ask someone else. She told me that no one else can because her in laws live in another state, our brother and SIL work too, and both out parents also have jobs. Basically I'm the only one who's free during the days. I told her in that case she should send them to daycare but she said that the kids aren't that well since the accident and she would prefer if they can be babysat for family, at least for a couple months until they can get used to the idea of losing their dad.\n\nLastly she told me if I could at least babysit for her in the morning, then our mom agreed to cut some hours so she can babysit during the afternoon. I told her that what they're going though is very sad, but I stood my ground about not babysitting, thats simply not what I want now. I told her that was the final answer and to stop calling me over that because I wont change my mind. She cried and called me an asshole, she went on and on about how hard her life is and such, she said that her kids cry all the time because of their dad and they need family now and how I should help her when I can. I told her that her kids are not my responsibility, she can ask but I already said no so she should drop it. Now everyone in my family is angry at me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am free most days because I work some nights, I don't work full time. However that's not relevant, I don't pull all nighters, I get home quite early.

A good person would babysit the kids for a couple months as requested.", "Ordinarily, I would come down on your side. But your sister has been through quite an ordeal. She lost her husband and is now facing life as a single mother. Unless you're estranged from your family or you have a family full of abusers (and it doesn't look like you do), I would say that when tragedy strikes, you should all come together for the sake of your sister.\n\nI get that you don't want to babysit, but your mother is making sacrifices for the sake of your sister, offering to fill in for afternoons. You can make a sacrifice, too. \n\nHelp her out. It's only a few months before she feels ready to let them go to daycare. She's offering to pay you whatever you want.\n\nMoreover, if you don't help her out, what right would you have to ask her to help you out, if ***you*** ever find yourself in a predicament and need help from your family?\n\nYTA.", "This is one of the posts where maybe NTA, they asked, you said no, but damn how hard is it to understand people need help sometimes, to be compassionate", "NTA. The situation is very sad but you're not obligated to be a nanny, especially if you don't have any desire. It's not going to be healthy you or the kids in the end if you're forced into it. She may not want to hire a professional nanny but it's a much better option for the kids overall.", "Esh. She shouldn't badger but damn if you aren't lacking empathy for a family member (and children at that) who are clearly struggling with their loss. \nI'll say it this way,  you are well within your rights to not want to babysit.

I\u2019ve been back and forth in this one, but your last comment in our below conversation kinda just nails the coffin shut for me. I understand that you don\u2019t *want* to babysit five mornings a week, but your whole family is coming together to help your sister in a time of crisis. I would understand your position if you felt you couldn\u2019t babysit and do your job as you would like, but according to you, that\u2019s not the case. You feel you could do it, you just don\u2019t want to, and that\u2019s just a frightening lack of empathy. At 29, your sister is transitioning away from SAHmotherhood into a full time career while grieving her husband. Meanwhile, at 4 and 6, your nephew and niece just lost their father and now are going to lose the majority of their mother\u2019s time as well. Your mother is going to work less to help out, and you aren\u2019t even willing to give up some free time\u2026 because you\u2019d rather sleep in? Seriously, this is a couple months out of your life to provide traumatized children with love and support from their aunt as they are going through the hardest thing they\u2019ll likely (hopefully) ever experience. This is the kind of sacrifice we all make for our families. Unless there are some missing pieces to this puzzle regarding an abusive family history, you really are showing an appallingly selfish ethos. Do what you will, but understand that if you don\u2019t help them out, you might as well make your goodbyes to the rest of your family. If you don\u2019t want to be a part of it when it\u2019s inconvenient for you, they won\u2019t be there when you want or need them.

Where are you living? ~~", "Gentle YTA. \n\nGet a job, then you won't be available for babysitting.", "Would it be nice for you to babysit after all they went through? Yeah, totally. I am kind of in the same position as you (WFH job I could easily babysit if needed/if I wanted). So if I imagine myself in your shoes, I would also refuse to babysit because kids, especially that young, are draining and a lot of work. I don't want kids and I don't particularly enjoy being around them, so I would say no to babysitting. Your sister should understand and find a daycare or another babysitter (there are many sites and money doesn't seem like a huge issue in this post). Yes, the kids are traumatized but they would be whether or not family watched them. They will need therapy either way for this terrible situation they've gone through - your sister as well perhaps. Shitty things happen and it sucks and life sucks afterwards for a bit. In no way are you or your sister assholes in this situation because she is stressed (rightfully) and you have the right to deny babysitting two young kids that are a lot of responsibility and work (rightfully).\n\nSo, can some people see your choice as rude and selfish? Yes. Does that mean you have to babysit? Absolutely not. So, NTA.

And I have an older sister too. I remember being in my early 20s, single with no children, and my sister being married with children. Thankfully, my sister didn't lose her husband or have any traumatic events happen to her. But I would always help out my sister when I could. I knew that one day I would be married and have children, and that my sister would then help me if I needed help. And she did.\n\nI get that you don't want to be a full time babysitter. I perfectly understand that. And I see your sister's point of view with this too. Her children have been through a traumatic event.

She's only asking for help in the mornings for 2 months to help the kids transition to not having a sahm, and then moving onto daycare. She also says she'll pay you whatever you want. I've seen comments saying oh she'll underpay you, and it won't be 2 months it'll end up permanent. But nothing in your post suggests that, and clearly you have no issue in setting your boundaries. I just can't see why you wouldn't help out family for such a short time during such a difficult time. Make it clear you want to be paid the going rate, and the maximum is 2 months then she'll be on her own.

She and her kids are grieving and it will be way easier on them to be with family and transition to daycare or a babysitter they don\u2019t know once they\u2019ve had some time to process without more jarring change.\n\nMaybe consider taking her offer of babysitting in the morning only, and set a clear boundary on timeframes and how often you are expected to babysit, compensation for that time, and when that time will end- whether that\u2019s 2 weeks or a month. Do it in her home so you won\u2019t be worried about access to their necessary supplies or a mess in your own home. That will give her time to screen babysitters or a daycare, and give them time to meet and adjust to a new caregiver and slowly transition to time with you to time with a long term carer. They\u2019re going through enough trauma right now, having a familiar person available while they adjust and then a smoother transition into a more long term solution will be much better for their mental health than another sudden change.\n\nUsually I\u2019m not one to suggest doing something you don\u2019t want to, but sometimes you just need to help family. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s expecting you to do it for nothing either, like a lot of people on here expect from family babysitters. She\u2019s not acting entitled, which would have changed my answer, she\u2019s literally desperate and begging you, and offering to pay you at a *name your price* rate to help her out in a time of desperation. If she\u2019s happy to compensate you as a babysitter, and not wanting a favor for free, then take the temporary hit to your free time and help her out. Her situation is hard enough, and she\u2019s still considerate enough to recognize that it\u2019s a burden and a sacrifice for you by offering generous compensation. \n\nIf you really can\u2019t stomach being around kids (which I get is an issue for some people, for various reasons like mess, stress, triggers, or just discomfort with their ability to care for kids properly) maybe offer to help her find a babysitter or daycare and possibly be there in the transition so there\u2019s a familiar face while they\u2019re getting used to someone new, if being the primary caregiver for any period of time is what bothers you. That way they can get used to the babysitter, your sister can get an adults feedback of how the kids are handling the change (besides the babysitters, since a bad one may embellish how well it went to keep the gig). Ask friends that you trust if they would be interested, or ask friends or acquaintances if they have older teens who may be interested. Suggest she get her kiddos into grief therapy and maybe help her research to find a suitable therapist, as that will help them significantly and could eat up a small bit of time where she won\u2019t need a babysitter.", "YTA. Reading this made me laugh at what a joke you are. Karma is beautiful though.", "NTA no is a complete sentence regardless of your rationale behind it. Doesn\u2019t mean your answer may not come with some consequences. You are under no obligation to babysit her children and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person either.", "When she says she\u2019ll pay you what you want, what she really means is she can\u2019t afford a real babysitter and she\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll do it for peanuts. The sort of fee she has in mind would be perfect content for r/choosingbeggars I\u2019m sure. \n\nYou don\u2019t need a reason to not want to babysit her kids. They\u2019re not your kids and you have no obligation to them. It\u2019s sad how her life has gone, but you never signed up to be part of her troubles. \n\nNTA.", "YTA\n\nHow could you possibly not want to help your sister after she's been through the worst thing imaginable? Her whole family was unexpectedly destroyed and she is trying to work to keep them afloat\n\nI don't even know her and I want to help her\n\nDon't even care if I get down voted, I think you're heartless", "YTA.\n\nThat being said, it's obvious that your sister and her children are so much better off without you helping to raise and influence her kids. I can only imagine how very selfish, entitled and self-absorbed they will grow up to be with you as a constant example for them to judge what a mature and well adjusted adult should be.\n\nShame on you.", "NTA.  If she can afford to pay you 'whatever you want' then she can afford to pay someone else.    I notice none of her plans actually include someone who can't be guilted because FaMiLy.  She needs to look into actually paying for childcare.", "If she can pay her sister whatever she wants, while maintaining the lifestyle they had and saving, she can hire a nanny, possibly one with experience/info on helping grieving kids. Inless she assumed OP would reply that she doesn\u2019t need money to help family. \n\nI know it\u2019s a post on the internet and people obscure info, but is it normal to go from SAHM to maintaining lifestyle for 2 kids (and paying full time baby sitter?). \n\nI am temperamentally unsuited to dealing with kids. I was back up help to my mom for my nieces for 4 days and was amusing muself thinking about tossing the 4 month old at my sister as she walked back in, and booking it out of there. \n\nSituation sucks, but that does not mean OP should become a permanent babysitter. In an emergency sure, not as a full time plan.", "Agreed. \n\nOP is under no obligation to babysit, but I don\u2019t understand families that don\u2019t want to help each other in times of tragedy on a temp basis when they are able to, unless those family members have been abusive or have previously taken advantage.", "NTA: Daycare is massively better than spending all day with a family member that resents having to watch them. OP knows their own emotional limitations and pushing them to \u201cstep up\u201d when they\u2019re clearly not in any kind of headspace to give kids what they need is just detrimental to the kids wellbeing. OP is being responsible in opting out.", "Not unpopular - I completely agree. Asking OP to babysit the kids in the morning is a reasonable request born from a short-term, emergency situation. Providing childcare would have no negative ramifications for OP\u2019s finances, career, or personal relationships. Her refusal is an act of pure selfishness. OP technically doesn\u2019t have a responsibility to watch her niece and nephew, but then her sister technically doesn\u2019t have a responsibility to maintain a relationship with her. OP, if you\u2019re not willing to be there when your family needs you, don\u2019t expect to be there when they don\u2019t. YTA.", "I agree with you, and as a parent I wouldn\u2019t want to leave my (traumatized) kids with such an unloving and uncaring person. \n\nYTA OP, please show your post to your sister and I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t ask again.", "If she can pay, then there's nothing stopping her from paying for childcare.", "I know its shocking! And she has the shamelessness to say she simply just does not want to babysit - so callous! Theyre such easy abea to babysit too - 6 year okd will be in school, they can feed themselves & go toilet by themselves!", "Wouldn't the 6 yr. old be in school?", "NTA.\n\nYou said it perfectly. So many don't seem capable to accept or even understand that some peope do not enjoy taking care of children and find it incredibly stressfull to be responsible for them.\n\nSister says the kids are (understandably) not well. I can't see how an inexperienced, reluctant, possibly tired family member would be better to care for the kids than a professional (maybe a nanny specialized in caring for grieving children?). \n\nThe day-to-day life of the kids will be changed anyway.", "It's not full time..their mom said she'd cut her hours to babysit in the afternoons, and OP's not working all night..", "Yes, NTA! She was nice about saying no. She doesn't have to do something she doesn't want to.  And she doesn't want to babysit. \nIt's like a job offer. Employer can ask all they want and say they'll pay you whatever you need. But you still have a right to say no, thank you I don't want this iob\nSister needs to take no for an answer, op even gave her options.", "Not 'all day'. Read it again. \n\n>Lastly she told me if I could at least babysit for her in the morning, then our mom agreed to cut some hours so she can babysit during the afternoon.", "After the extra fee sex on her escort dates. OP explained this in a reply above.", "Right?! She sounds disgustingly cold", "Little selfish?! Shes being so selfish & heartless & has shamelessness to say she just doesnt want to help her with reason whatsoever. Doesnt want to help her sister who lost her husband & niece+nephew, who lost their dad - she sounds so callous", "NTA I think day care may be better for the simple fact of getting out of the house. This would occupy the kids. Plus if op babysits a few months then they go to daycare it would be another big change for the kids after just setting from losing dad and mom going back to work.", "Agreed. I think this is a case of a SAHM freaking out that her kids are going out in the world. Amplified by the recent tragic loss. She\u2019s not thinking straight here. Daycare would be the best option.", "Maybe she doesn't want to pay daycare prices? Sister seems fixated on unwilling family members. If price is no problem why not a housekeeper/babysitter for the day time? Get a trusted person who loves children?", "I was wondering about that. The 4 year old would probably also be in school where I live. School isn't mandatory until age 6, but Junior Kindergarten starts at age 4.", "Exactly! I\u2019m just a year older than OP and my entire world physically and mentally would collapse if i suddenly had to take one two young kids with trauma. They need a specialist. Family isn\u2019t always the answer but people refuse to admit that", "My question is , during these months of babysitting, how will they get health insurance? Dental? Vision?", "If she can really pay anything why can't see simply not work and save the money?", "I would rather my sister be open with me and tell me no than put my kids in the position of being around someone who doesn\u2019t want to be around them and won\u2019t be emotionally available for them during this difficult time.", "Yes, you told us above what you do. You are an escort who has sex for an additional fee. I too hope you feel good about yourself.", "Yeah. Wouldn\u2019t daycare with other children to distract them and have fun with be better than OP reluctantly watching them? \n\nI think OPs sister is wrong in what the children would actually enjoy more. When I was a kid,  Moping around with an adult who doesn\u2019t want to play with me would not have been preferable to playing with other kids my age- no matter the recent trauma.", "A couple of months is not short term, when it comes to childcare. I adore my niblings, but more than a few days under regular circumstances or more than a few weeks during special circumstances like this would be too much.\n\nBut OP could have offered a compromise, and agreed to watch the kids while they slowly introduce a sitter and get the kids comfortable with them before leaving them with the sitter without OP.\n\nHer refusal to provide childcare doesn't make her an AH. Her complete unwillingness to provide any help or support or compromise, and the callousness of how she's treating her sister whose entire world just got turned upside down, is what makes OP the AH.", "Do you think the escort service provides those benefits?", "Maybe you can ask the tooth fairy this hypothetical question", "She is an escort on weekends and not all night.", "Yes, paid sex (for an additional fee) can be exhausting. OP clearly explained above what she does for a living.", "Op is a escort, so her schedule depends on her clients.", "Like I said, realistically, I don't think I, personally, would be able to look after children at this age with these specific needs. I would want to help, but don't think it would be helpful at all. \n\nI didn't say OP wasn't an asshole. But I do think that OP's sister would be an asshole to her children if she kept pushing or left the kids with OP who doesn't want to look after them.", "Agree to disagree. Her unwillingness, rudeness and her comments under the posts make her not only an ah but a huge one. \n\nA few months is short term to me.", "As a former flight attendant who exclusively did international flights, I disagree. Most people are able to adapt when they need to. People also work two jobs because they need to.
