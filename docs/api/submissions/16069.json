Her husband passed away in a work related accident. I won't go into much detail, but she got quite some money for his life insurance and there's some other legal issues going on and maybe she'll get more money out of it. \n\nPrior to the accident she was a SAHM but now, for obvious reasons, she needs to get a job. I don't have a regular job so I'm free most days. \n\nWell she asked me to babysit for her kids during the days, she said she'll pay me whatever I want. She said she found something that  will pay her well and she'll be able to keep their house and lifestyle and save the other money for her kid's future/ emergencies. I told her that I dont want to be a babysitter and to ask someone else. She told me that no one else can because her in laws live in another state, our brother and SIL work too, and both out parents also have jobs. Basically I'm the only one who's free during the days. I told her in that case she should send them to daycare but she said that the kids aren't that well since the accident and she would prefer if they can be babysat for family, at least for a couple months until they can get used to the idea of losing their dad.\n\nLastly she told me if I could at least babysit for her in the morning, then our mom agreed to cut some hours so she can babysit during the afternoon. I told her that what they're going though is very sad, but I stood my ground about not babysitting, thats simply not what I want now. I told her that was the final answer and to stop calling me over that because I wont change my mind. She cried and called me an asshole, she went on and on about how hard her life is and such, she said that her kids cry all the time because of their dad and they need family now and how I should help her when I can. I told her that her kids are not my responsibility, she can ask but I already said no so she should drop it. Now everyone in my family is angry at me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am free most days because I work some nights, I don't work full time. However that's not relevant, I don't pull all nighters, I get home quite early.

A good person would babysit the kids for a couple months as requested.", "Ordinarily, I would come down on your side. But your sister has been through quite an ordeal. She lost her husband and is now facing life as a single mother. Unless you're estranged from your family or you have a family full of abusers (and it doesn't look like you do), I would say that when tragedy strikes, you should all come together for the sake of your sister.\n\nI get that you don't want to babysit, but your mother is making sacrifices for the sake of your sister, offering to fill in for afternoons. You can make a sacrifice, too. \n\nHelp her out. It's only a few months before she feels ready to let them go to daycare. She's offering to pay you whatever you want.\n\nMoreover, if you don't help her out, what right would you have to ask her to help you out, if ***you*** ever find yourself in a predicament and need help from your family?\n\nYTA.", "This is one of the posts where maybe NTA, they asked, you said no, but damn how hard is it to understand people need help sometimes, to be compassionate", "NTA. The situation is very sad but you're not obligated to be a nanny, especially if you don't have any desire. It's not going to be healthy you or the kids in the end if you're forced into it. She may not want to hire a professional nanny but it's a much better option for the kids overall.", "Esh. She shouldn't badger but damn if you aren't lacking empathy for a family member (and children at that) who are clearly struggling with their loss. \nI'll say it this way,  you are well within your rights to not want to babysit.

I\u2019ve been back and forth in this one, but your last comment in our below conversation kinda just nails the coffin shut for me. I understand that you don\u2019t *want* to babysit five mornings a week, but your whole family is coming together to help your sister in a time of crisis. I would understand your position if you felt you couldn\u2019t babysit and do your job as you would like, but according to you, that\u2019s not the case. You feel you could do it, you just don\u2019t want to, and that\u2019s just a frightening lack of empathy. At 29, your sister is transitioning away from SAHmotherhood into a full time career while grieving her husband. Meanwhile, at 4 and 6, your nephew and niece just lost their father and now are going to lose the majority of their mother\u2019s time as well. Your mother is going to work less to help out, and you aren\u2019t even willing to give up some free time\u2026 because you\u2019d rather sleep in? Seriously, this is a couple months out of your life to provide traumatized children with love and support from their aunt as they are going through the hardest thing they\u2019ll likely (hopefully) ever experience. This is the kind of sacrifice we all make for our families. Unless there are some missing pieces to this puzzle regarding an abusive family history, you really are showing an appallingly selfish ethos. Do what you will, but understand that if you don\u2019t help them out, you might as well make your goodbyes to the rest of your family. If you don\u2019t want to be a part of it when it\u2019s inconvenient for you, they won\u2019t be there when you want or need them.

Where are you living? ~~", "Gentle YTA. \n\nGet a job, then you won't be available for babysitting.", "Would it be nice for you to babysit after all they went through? Yeah, totally. I am kind of in the same position as you (WFH job I could easily babysit if needed/if I wanted). So if I imagine myself in your shoes, I would also refuse to babysit because kids, especially that young, are draining and a lot of work. I don't want kids and I don't particularly enjoy being around them, so I would say no to babysitting. Your sister should understand and find a daycare or another babysitter (there are many sites and money doesn't seem like a huge issue in this post). Yes, the kids are traumatized but they would be whether or not family watched them. They will need therapy either way for this terrible situation they've gone through - your sister as well perhaps. Shitty things happen and it sucks and life sucks afterwards for a bit. In no way are you or your sister assholes in this situation because she is stressed (rightfully) and you have the right to deny babysitting two young kids that are a lot of responsibility and work (rightfully).\n\nSo, can some people see your choice as rude and selfish? Yes. Does that mean you have to babysit? Absolutely not. So, NTA.

And I have an older sister too. I remember being in my early 20s, single with no children, and my sister being married with children. Thankfully, my sister didn't lose her husband or have any traumatic events happen to her. But I would always help out my sister when I could. I knew that one day I would be married and have children, and that my sister would then help me if I needed help. And she did.\n\nI get that you don't want to be a full time babysitter. I perfectly understand that. And I see your sister's point of view with this too. Her children have been through a traumatic event.

She's only asking for help in the mornings for 2 months to help the kids transition to not having a sahm, and then moving onto daycare. She also says she'll pay you whatever you want. I've seen comments saying oh she'll underpay you, and it won't be 2 months it'll end up permanent. But nothing in your post suggests that, and clearly you have no issue in setting your boundaries. I just can't see why you wouldn't help out family for such a short time during such a difficult time. Make it clear you want to be paid the going rate, and the maximum is 2 months then she'll be on her own.
