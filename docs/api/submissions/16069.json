Her husband passed away in a work related accident. I won't go into much detail, but she got quite some money for his life insurance and there's some other legal issues going on and maybe she'll get more money out of it. \n\nPrior to the accident she was a SAHM but now, for obvious reasons, she needs to get a job. I don't have a regular job so I'm free most days. \n\nWell she asked me to babysit for her kids during the days, she said she'll pay me whatever I want. She said she found something that  will pay her well and she'll be able to keep their house and lifestyle and save the other money for her kid's future/ emergencies. I told her that I dont want to be a babysitter and to ask someone else. She told me that no one else can because her in laws live in another state, our brother and SIL work too, and both out parents also have jobs. Basically I'm the only one who's free during the days. I told her in that case she should send them to daycare but she said that the kids aren't that well since the accident and she would prefer if they can be babysat for family, at least for a couple months until they can get used to the idea of losing their dad.\n\nLastly she told me if I could at least babysit for her in the morning, then our mom agreed to cut some hours so she can babysit during the afternoon. I told her that what they're going though is very sad, but I stood my ground about not babysitting, thats simply not what I want now. I told her that was the final answer and to stop calling me over that because I wont change my mind. She cried and called me an asshole, she went on and on about how hard her life is and such, she said that her kids cry all the time because of their dad and they need family now and how I should help her when I can. I told her that her kids are not my responsibility, she can ask but I already said no so she should drop it. Now everyone in my family is angry at me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am free most days because I work some nights, I don't work full time. However that's not relevant, I don't pull all nighters, I get home quite early.

A good person would babysit the kids for a couple months as requested.", "Ordinarily, I would come down on your side. But your sister has been through quite an ordeal. She lost her husband and is now facing life as a single mother. Unless you're estranged from your family or you have a family full of abusers (and it doesn't look like you do), I would say that when tragedy strikes, you should all come together for the sake of your sister.\n\nI get that you don't want to babysit, but your mother is making sacrifices for the sake of your sister, offering to fill in for afternoons. You can make a sacrifice, too. \n\nHelp her out. It's only a few months before she feels ready to let them go to daycare. She's offering to pay you whatever you want.\n\nMoreover, if you don't help her out, what right would you have to ask her to help you out, if ***you*** ever find yourself in a predicament and need help from your family?\n\nYTA.", "This is one of the posts where maybe NTA, they asked, you said no, but damn how hard is it to understand people need help sometimes, to be compassionate", "NTA. The situation is very sad but you're not obligated to be a nanny, especially if you don't have any desire. It's not going to be healthy you or the kids in the end if you're forced into it. She may not want to hire a professional nanny but it's a much better option for the kids overall.", "Esh. She shouldn't badger but damn if you aren't lacking empathy for a family member (and children at that) who are clearly struggling with their loss. \nI'll say it this way,  you are well within your rights to not want to babysit.

I\u2019ve been back and forth in this one, but your last comment in our below conversation kinda just nails the coffin shut for me. I understand that you don\u2019t *want* to babysit five mornings a week, but your whole family is coming together to help your sister in a time of crisis. I would understand your position if you felt you couldn\u2019t babysit and do your job as you would like, but according to you, that\u2019s not the case. You feel you could do it, you just don\u2019t want to, and that\u2019s just a frightening lack of empathy. At 29, your sister is transitioning away from SAHmotherhood into a full time career while grieving her husband. Meanwhile, at 4 and 6, your nephew and niece just lost their father and now are going to lose the majority of their mother\u2019s time as well. Your mother is going to work less to help out, and you aren\u2019t even willing to give up some free time\u2026 because you\u2019d rather sleep in? Seriously, this is a couple months out of your life to provide traumatized children with love and support from their aunt as they are going through the hardest thing they\u2019ll likely (hopefully) ever experience. This is the kind of sacrifice we all make for our families. Unless there are some missing pieces to this puzzle regarding an abusive family history, you really are showing an appallingly selfish ethos. Do what you will, but understand that if you don\u2019t help them out, you might as well make your goodbyes to the rest of your family. If you don\u2019t want to be a part of it when it\u2019s inconvenient for you, they won\u2019t be there when you want or need them.

Where are you living? ~~", "Gentle YTA. \n\nGet a job, then you won't be available for babysitting.", "Would it be nice for you to babysit after all they went through? Yeah, totally. I am kind of in the same position as you (WFH job I could easily babysit if needed/if I wanted). So if I imagine myself in your shoes, I would also refuse to babysit because kids, especially that young, are draining and a lot of work. I don't want kids and I don't particularly enjoy being around them, so I would say no to babysitting. Your sister should understand and find a daycare or another babysitter (there are many sites and money doesn't seem like a huge issue in this post). Yes, the kids are traumatized but they would be whether or not family watched them. They will need therapy either way for this terrible situation they've gone through - your sister as well perhaps. Shitty things happen and it sucks and life sucks afterwards for a bit. In no way are you or your sister assholes in this situation because she is stressed (rightfully) and you have the right to deny babysitting two young kids that are a lot of responsibility and work (rightfully).\n\nSo, can some people see your choice as rude and selfish? Yes. Does that mean you have to babysit? Absolutely not. So, NTA.

And I have an older sister too. I remember being in my early 20s, single with no children, and my sister being married with children. Thankfully, my sister didn't lose her husband or have any traumatic events happen to her. But I would always help out my sister when I could. I knew that one day I would be married and have children, and that my sister would then help me if I needed help. And she did.\n\nI get that you don't want to be a full time babysitter. I perfectly understand that. And I see your sister's point of view with this too. Her children have been through a traumatic event.

She's only asking for help in the mornings for 2 months to help the kids transition to not having a sahm, and then moving onto daycare. She also says she'll pay you whatever you want. I've seen comments saying oh she'll underpay you, and it won't be 2 months it'll end up permanent. But nothing in your post suggests that, and clearly you have no issue in setting your boundaries. I just can't see why you wouldn't help out family for such a short time during such a difficult time. Make it clear you want to be paid the going rate, and the maximum is 2 months then she'll be on her own.

She and her kids are grieving and it will be way easier on them to be with family and transition to daycare or a babysitter they don\u2019t know once they\u2019ve had some time to process without more jarring change.\n\nMaybe consider taking her offer of babysitting in the morning only, and set a clear boundary on timeframes and how often you are expected to babysit, compensation for that time, and when that time will end- whether that\u2019s 2 weeks or a month. Do it in her home so you won\u2019t be worried about access to their necessary supplies or a mess in your own home. That will give her time to screen babysitters or a daycare, and give them time to meet and adjust to a new caregiver and slowly transition to time with you to time with a long term carer. They\u2019re going through enough trauma right now, having a familiar person available while they adjust and then a smoother transition into a more long term solution will be much better for their mental health than another sudden change.\n\nUsually I\u2019m not one to suggest doing something you don\u2019t want to, but sometimes you just need to help family. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s expecting you to do it for nothing either, like a lot of people on here expect from family babysitters. She\u2019s not acting entitled, which would have changed my answer, she\u2019s literally desperate and begging you, and offering to pay you at a *name your price* rate to help her out in a time of desperation. If she\u2019s happy to compensate you as a babysitter, and not wanting a favor for free, then take the temporary hit to your free time and help her out. Her situation is hard enough, and she\u2019s still considerate enough to recognize that it\u2019s a burden and a sacrifice for you by offering generous compensation. \n\nIf you really can\u2019t stomach being around kids (which I get is an issue for some people, for various reasons like mess, stress, triggers, or just discomfort with their ability to care for kids properly) maybe offer to help her find a babysitter or daycare and possibly be there in the transition so there\u2019s a familiar face while they\u2019re getting used to someone new, if being the primary caregiver for any period of time is what bothers you. That way they can get used to the babysitter, your sister can get an adults feedback of how the kids are handling the change (besides the babysitters, since a bad one may embellish how well it went to keep the gig). Ask friends that you trust if they would be interested, or ask friends or acquaintances if they have older teens who may be interested. Suggest she get her kiddos into grief therapy and maybe help her research to find a suitable therapist, as that will help them significantly and could eat up a small bit of time where she won\u2019t need a babysitter.", "YTA.

Getting someone outside the family involved who can address those issues would be a much better option, I would think.", "I hope she does and is treated just as callously.  Maybe then she'll learn to be a decent human being.   Because she sure isn't now.", "Massive overreach.", "It can be, if expectations are set and boundaries are kept.\n \nAfter my brother was divorced, he didn't have anywhere to go and lost his job due to depression. He had six months to live with my family free of charge, and after that he needed to be at a different place.\n\nWas there some tension? Yes. But we never, ever said anything about an extension, so out he went. After he was settled everything was fine between us.", "Yeah? Exactly, so please explain how it would be good for the kids to be around her?", "\u201cAbusive\u201d?? Come on.", "My dad passed when I was 9 and my sister was 11. My mom quit a pretty good job and started working part-time to be home with us.  Things got tight, but she was way more worried about the trauma of losing him than the short-term finances. If the sister got some money and is potentially expecting more, she can tighten her belt and be home until she thinks her kids are ready for daycare.  She is the best option for them.  We only wanted mom at the time and we were older.", "I think the day care would give the children structure and would be healthier emotionally then being home in front of a screen with a disinterested caregiver.  However it's not easy right now to find a good quality day care.  There could be a waiting list but find one and get on the list and in the meantime pay for a caregiver (not OP) to cover mornings.  Nothing is going to be perfect but young children thrive with routine.  And can be amazingly resilient with the right support.", "Is it?  OP says they have an ok relationship.  Sister lost her husband.  Niece and nephew lost their dad, and OP just\u2026doesn\u2019t give a shit.  Her basic attitude is \u201cnot my problem.\u201d  That level of selfishness is pretty massive.  You have to be lacking something very basic to have this level of hardheartedness.", "Because she works nights. You are also free most nights. Are you looking for a second job for nights?", "Starting school at 6 is wild to me! Here it\u2019s pre-school from age 3-4 and then I started actual school a few months before I was 5.", "I do feel good about myself, thanks", "Daycare can actually be very stressful for children, at least at the beginning. Many kids take weeks to adjust. Others still cry at every drop off in kindergarten. Now is not the time to suddenly add that stress.", "That's an excellent point.", "If I only worked a few hours a week, like OP, I would absolutely help my family.  Frankly, even if I worked full time I would find a way.  OP is selfish and so are you.", "Going on dates is my job, I do work during the night", "In an ideal world yes.", "Clearly OP doesn't know what love is.   I hope she understands Karmas a bitch.   Her family has lost respect and consideration for her.  YTA", "I wonder if OP could help out in different ways?  Maybe help provide meals or housecleaning or help with transportation.", "And the fact that she doesn\u2019t want to should be enough.", "Easy for you to say, sitting on your high horse.", "I agree with everything you've said. Also something else is that suddnely after 2 weeks the mother HAS to go back to work in the afternoons as she's been threatened with being fired or some such crap so OP will be stuck doing it all day, 5 days a week and that \"any price you name\" will either be bargained down using guilt or she'll keep forgetting to pay in time, or pay a little bit and say \"I'll owe you, I promise I'll pay it!\"  \nIf it was really about ANY price, she could afford to pay the mother who is willing a full salary to be the full time nanny. She can't afford \"any\" price.", "Most people have empathy. Poor sister thought OP had a heart and cared about her niblings.", "After a traumatic family event like that? Not if she still wants to be a part of that family.", "The fact that it\u2019s okay for her not to want to take on that responsibility doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t an AH for it. Both can be true.", "\"No\" is a full sentence, and she said she doesn't want to babysit. So you have the full picture. It doesn't matter why she doesn't want to. If she doesn't want to do it, she doesn't have to, and it wouldn't be good for the kids anyway.", "You should update your post to include this. \n\nNTA", "I didn't say the sister was wrong to ask. But, now that she has said no, she is wrong for continuing to ask.", "You can be plenty empathetic and still not want to babysit. I love my nieces and cousins, but outside an absolute *dire* emergency, I won't babysit", "I\u2019m not trying to be a thundercloud but life is long and you are acting like someone who thinks they will never need a favor. It is your right to refuse, even if your reason is that you don\u2019t feel like it, but I wouldn\u2019t expect your family to lift a finger for you in your inevitable time of need.", "She tried to find a compromise thinking it was about the number of hours.  Silly sister. Assumed her sibling loved her", "That says a lot about you as a person.", "I said if she continues. Not that she was an asshole up until now. If she continues to ask after realizing it's not the hours, and leaves her emotionally fragile children with OP knowing that she lacks that empathy, she will be an asshole.", "Why? Because I don't want kids and don't know how to look after them? I'd be a terrible babysitter.", "I'm not going to say YTA or NTA. You don't have to babysit someone else's kids. They're not your responsibility. However, they are your family, and they really need your help. \n\nDo whatever you want, but be prepared for the consequences. She probably won't talk to you much, if at all, from now on. You'll lose any relationship with your niblins. And the rest of the family will think you're a heartless jerk.\n\nSo, i say again, you're not obligated to babysit, but you are obligated to endure the hatred this choice brings.", "YTA", " YTA, unless you hate your family, this is when being family matters.", "Just looking at your replies it\u2019s clear YTA.  You can and should do better for your sister, even if temporarily.", "Pretty safe to say you are void of love.\n\nYTA", "Yta. It\u2019s just the mornings. Poor kids.", "There's no guarantee that it would be short term, but other than that I agree that helping out short term isn't a big deal if you love them.", "I was reading and thinking the same thing. I couldn\u2019t imagine if my brother turned his back on me in a very tragic moment in my life. Talk about leaving your sister and your nibblings out to dry. \nOP, YTA \u2014 you can do or not do whatever you want, but it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s bad blood between you to warrant such a staunch No from you.", "Just because someone is family doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the right person to help kids through trauma. Sounds like they need an actual therapist.", "Agreed. OP has the time and is offered pay. They can take the time to help, even part time, to help.\n\nThough I'd make a clear end date, a clear job description and expectations, and a clear payday to avoid confusion.", "Whether its short term is really the big question. Its not clear in OPs post.", "Not everyone is cut out to be a babysitter. I think OP is wise to understand her limits. I'm sure there are professional agencies who could provide well-trained babysitters and the sister can afford it. So why is she demanding that someone babysit her kids (who doesn't want to take care of them)  just because she's related to her? Makes no sense. This totally sounds like a situation where the sister would have total say in how much OP would have to babysit and if OP quit in a few months or years without sister's approval, OP's family would tell OP she's an AH. What if OP wants to get married and have her own kids?", "There are a lot of Reddit posts where women are automatically volunteer for caregiving roles by their family whether they want it or not. Would someone presume that a guy her age should babysit? I assume the answer is no.", "This 100%, boundaries are super important, but so is family. Balancing various values is essential and re-evaluating boundaries when shit hits the fan is part of being human. Personally, I read Op's post as just not understanding that sometimes situations you have only second-hand involvement in require action even if you wouldn't normally. Inaction results in heartlessness and thus, gentle YTA.", "Yikes project that trauma a little harder", "Obviously jealous of OP given that you've commented about this specific part of her info at least three different times. Get over it.", "Right! OP literally emphasizes that it\u2019s not because she can\u2019t, which is what people are using to justify her reason, it\u2019s that she just doesn\u2019t want to help her sister. \n\nShe is all within her rights to say no, but that\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t a asshole for being heartless towards her sister.", "the ppl who downvoted dont have loving sisters", "I would say she is the asshole if it was a week, or two, but this doesn\u2019t sound short term. \n\nI would have trouble doing it. I really don\u2019t enjoy being around kids that age. I am not sure I could give them the care they need. But I would try for a week or two but not months. Holy hell that sounds quite unpleasant", "She has the reasoning of an asshole, the actions of an asshole, yet\u2026 she isn\u2019t an asshole? Kinda sounds like she\u2019s an asshole.", "But that\u2019s not the question we\u2019ve been asked to judge. The fundamental is OP an asshole for prioritizing late mornings over the grief of her sister, niece and nephew. And yes, yes she is.", "Do *you* feel good about yourself for being Judgy McJudgensteen to people you don't know, based on their jobs?", "I think OP's sister is doing the best she can in horrific circumstances. Perhaps she isn't getting everything right, but I'm not sure I'd be thinking with 100% clarity either. \n\nShe's reaching out for (temporary) help from her family, which isn't unreasonable. She's offering to pay whatever OP wants. OP has the time and their mother is cutting her hours to help make it work. OP's behaviour is selfish and she is TA.", "She might have to work in order to get medical benefits.", "Yet millions and millions of hardworking, non-whining, adults somehow manage to do it every day. Who do you think is working hospitals, steel mills, railroads?", "No, she's not. It's sad, but doesn't make her an asshole. It would make her an asshole if those were her kids, if she had agreed and then flaked, or something like that, but those kids are not her responsibility. And although that wasn't the question asked, the children's wellbeing is a priority, so that fact can't be ignored.", "Not everyone is equipped to handle two young children, physically or emotionally. My nephew is 8 and I still don't watch him solo, there's always another adult present. I love him dearly, I just am not cut out to care for children on my own. Closest you'd get is me minding one of my niblings while their parent is in the shower or something. \n\nThat doesn't mean I don't love them. I just barely keep myself alive, keeping two kids alive and dealing with their probably severe emotional problems 5 days a week would push me over the edge. \n\nAll in all, putting children under the care of people who don't want that responsibility is irresponsible and possibly dangerous. I feel for those kids, but they are humans and need to have their emotional and physically wellbeing put first and foremost. OP obviously cannot provide the care that they need, and the reasons why don't matter. It does not make them a bad person, just not the right person.", "And, unfortunately, that is a major American concern.", "She's dropping nothing. NTA still but she is probably not getting invited to any family holidays anytime soon.", "Where did you get the idea she won't do any favours? She doesn't like kids so she doesn't want to do this favour. I don't like dogs so if I were asked to dogsit my answer would be no. That doesn't mean I'm unwilling to help at all. I'd do just about anything else. The sister asking someone who doesn't like kids to be responsible for them for. an extended amount of time is ridiculous. They'd be better off with a professional who is both capable and wants to care for children rather than a family member who isn't and the sister can afford one.", "It says a lot about you as a person that you would choose to pawn off the responsibility of looking after the children you made the choice to bring into this world on someone who didn't make that choice at the slightest inconvenience. Other people are not responsible for your children, and forcing that responsibility onto someone who doesn't want it makes you a bad parent to your children."]}
