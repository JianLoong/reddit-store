They would never fight, were married for 29 years. Ever since they got divorced, my mom asks every little detail about my father's life. What does his house look like? Was there alcohol in the house? Is he texting someone when he's with me? Does the house have any indication that a woman has been there before? Did he ask about my mom? Where is he going after dropping me off? Does he smoke? How much is his house? Is he gonna buy a new house? Did he drink alcohol, if so how many did he drink? etc. so I would answer but for the past few months I keep saying 'why do you ask?'  'why do you care?' 'it isn't for you to worry about' because I genuinely want her to get over him. Today, my mom called me when I was in the school bus asking if my father had work on tuesday, I told her that I cancelled my plans on tuesday so she doesn't have to worry about anyone picking me up. (the school bus will drop me off) and she insisted, asking if he had anything on tuesday so I said no. After that she asked me if he had anything to do on wednesday and I just simply said 'why do you need this information' and she just started yelling at me to never ask her this again and hung up the phone.  I was home about 5 minutes later and she continued yelling at me saying 'I don't care about your sh!t father' and so on. I was already crying at this point so I just said 'okay' and went to my room to change. After 2 minutes she came into my room and yelled at me again, saying that she is hurt and I never try to understand how she feels. Also she went on about how my sister and I always bear down on her about this. I just continued crying and she made me eat dinner alone. I'm just so tired and idk what I'm doing wrong.. AITA?\n\nEDIT: My mom is over my dad but she isn't over him betraying her quite yet. My dad does not want custody so that isn't an issue here. She does not want to get back together, although my dad tried quite a few times and I support her for that.", "created_utc": 1674054567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f9n2s/aita_for_asking_my_mom_why_she_asks_about_my_dad/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously she is hurt by whatever happened between them but she is completely non understanding of your feelings when she takes these types of personal issues out on her child. She can't ask all those questions all the time then say she doesn't care about him. The fact that she mentioned your sister also gets on her about it, means others also notice. So it doesn't make sense to say she doesn't care about him. Sounds like she needs help getting past this. Sorry to hear you're taking the brunt of her anger.", "NTA. Tell if she doesn't care about your \"shit\" father, she wouldn't be asking all these questions unless she had an ulterior motive. And I would bet money with the kind of questions she's asking that motive is finding anything she could use against him in a custody hearing and driving a wedge between you and your father.

Her preoccupation with your Dad's new life is startling. She definitely shouldn't be putting you in the middle and asking you questions about his life. There is an unwritten rule that divorced parents should leave their kids OUT of discussions about the other parent. Also, she shouldn't be calling him names or saying anything negative about him to you. Issues she has with him should be addressed to him directly. I wouldn't give any information either.", "NTA. I'm with the popular opinion. Respond with \"ask Dad\". She is interfering with your visitation and relationship with your father. So wrong in so many ways.", "NTA your mom needs counseling. She\u2019s not coping with the divorce well. Just because she\u2019s \u201cover him\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s okay. Like you said your self she isn\u2019t over the betrayal.\n\nIt screams like she\u2019s searching for answers to her questions and possibly also looking for anyway she can feel vindicated hoping she\u2019ll be able to say, \u201cHah, he lives in a cheap house,\u201d or \u201chah, he can\u2019t even get a new woman\u201d maybe I\u2019m off base here. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s also looking for anything she can to get revenge. Like if he doesn\u2019t pick you up when he\u2019s supposed to, or doesn\u2019t provide for you at his house like he should, she could go back to court and get him less visitation? \n\nIt\u2019s hard to say, but I think you\u2019re on the right track with not answering questions that do not directly pertain to you or your sister. It\u2019s not her business. He has a right to privacy and a lot of those questions are just not her business, like if he\u2019s texting anyone, had a woman over, how much his house is, etc. And you definitely need to tell your father about her inappropriate questions so he can at least be aware in case she does try something.", "I am leaning towards NAH - but it's more that I don't really have a judgement to offer in that I don't think you are an ah, you're a kid, and I think your mum probably still loves your dad, so all these spying accusations from other posters seem a bit harsh. She is snooping but, I don't think it's malicious. OP mentions that her dad betrayed her mum, and that he tried to get back together and she said no, but that they otherwise had a pretty solid marriage for 29 years. 29 years is such a long time, it's really hard to just stop caring about someone - for her own self respect, and maybe to show her daughter not to stay with a cheat, she left someone she loved. 2 years isn't a long time to get over a 29 year relationship.", "NTA. Your mother should not be badgering you and your sister about her ex husband.", "My mom did this. \n\nNot anywhere near to this extent. \n\nBut enough that I came to dread it. It made me deeply uncomfortable. \n\nI ended up deciding on a short script I repeated, verbatim, as often as necessary: \n\n\"I am not comfortable discussing my father with you. Nor will I discuss you with my father. Please respect that.\"", "NTA. Your mom should not be doing this to you. I'd make your father aware of the situation though", "NTA but to respond to your edit it sure doesn't sound like she's over him her questions are improper you aren't her spy and you shouldn't be and her massive overreaction to your small push back is concerning.", "It sounds more like her mom is fishing for anything she could use against him in court with the kind of questions she's asking rather still hung up on him.", "Yeah, we're missing info.  Why did they divorce, and who initiated it?  I'm wondering if Mom wants to get back together with Dad.", "Doesn't matter that OP is a child. That actually makes mom's behavior way worse.", "That's my thought. That the dad wanted the divorce and she's still in love with him.", "Does knowing who initiated the divorce change anything? \n\nMom still seems like she'd be TA for involving thier kids\n\nCould be she wants dirt on dad to force a change on custody", "Yeah it would explain a lot and if it wasn't the mums idea should entitle her to a bit of patience and empathy."]}
