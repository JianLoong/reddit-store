My dad is about 25 years older than my mom so all 3 of my siblings from him are 17+ years older than me. I didn\u2019t have a relationship with that side of the family for majority of my childhood, but my dad and grandparents often sent money, holiday cards, birthday gifts, etc. I\u2019m a lot closer to them now and had good relationships with all of my siblings, nieces and nephews until this happened. \n\nI own a 1976 Corvette Stingray that was gifted to me by my maternal grandpa when I turned 17. I\u2019ve built this car up from a roller and it\u2019s my most prized possession. I went out of town for 2 weeks for work and left my car in my paternal grandparents\u2019 garage. I don\u2019t like keeping it at my place when I\u2019m away for long because I don\u2019t live in the best area. I\u2019ve done this since my freshman year of college and there has never been any issue until now. \n\nWhen I got back in town, I immediately went to my grandparents house to pick up my car and there was a big dent and a lot of paint missing off the side of my car.  It looked like someone side swiped my car. I asked them what happened and they were confused. When I showed them they were as shocked as I was. They told me that my nephew \u201cKevin\u201d 25M had been messing around in the garage the previous weekend but they didn\u2019t see him take the car at all. We checked their camera system and sure enough, he had taken my car. \n\nI tried to call Kevin but my number was blocked so I called my brother and told him what Kevin did to my car. He said he\u2019ll ask him about it and recommended a body shop for the estimate and repair. When I got the estimate back, there was $3700 in damages. I told my brother the estimate and he said that the estimate was ridiculous and that the damages weren\u2019t \u201cthat bad.\u201d I told him either he or Kevin had to pay for it to get fixed or I\u2019d be contacting the police. I gave him 3 days and he didn\u2019t pay me so I filed a police report and gave them the videos of him taking my car. Kevin was arrested at work and my brother was pissed. \n\nHe called me going off about how I ruined Kevin\u2019s life over a car and said some threats. My sisters and dad have been calling and texting me asking me to just put the family first and drop the charges but I don\u2019t want to.

Path of least resistance is simply for them to pay the bill. But absent that, file the claim.

So 3700 might look more like 15 or 20k. So, I'd advise them one last time that it's not going away.

And usually one occurrence isn't enough to justify a rate increase either, It's usually the repeat offenders that get the crazy rates. Definitely go through insurance!
