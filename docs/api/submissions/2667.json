Unless the nephew did the body damage getting the car in/out of the garage, have to assume some other vehicle was damaged and that would be illegal for nephew not to have notified the owner of that vehicle and exchanged insurance info.

Then there's OP's insurance: if OP reported it to his insurance (as he must in many states) his insurance is going to need the name and insurance info of whoever was driving and whoever was hit/hit OP's car.  Father trying to keep his son's pristine record pristine is unreasonable: the kid stole the car, damaged it somehow, maybe damaged someone else's car, and failed to report it....his record deserves being ruined.\n\nOP: the only wrong thing you did was giving your nephew the first chance to just cover this up by paying for damages; reporting him to the police now is absolutely right.
