This roommate had breasts like a girl. That roommate eats the same thing everyday and that's so bad because he's already fat!\n\nI had to sit him down last week and explain to him that he's hurting others feelings. I had to explain how intent is different than impact. And other peoples feelings matter, not your own, when it comes to talking about their life. You're not talking about your life.  It's ok to care but it's not your business to shove your thoughts onto him and shame him. If he wants to live his life like that, let him. He was sad. You didn't need to tear him down more. You could have said \"I'm sorry. How can I help you right now?\" or something HELPFUL. He's already aware he's fat. He's already aware he has breasts. He doesn't need you harping on it.\n\nYTA\n\nPS my client has the intellectual capacity of an 8 year old in a 50 something year old mans body.", "YTA \n\nThere are many reasons people are in the shape they are in. Slim, trim, beefy, thick, whatever. Some it\u2019s just their natural body (my dads side is thick, my moms is super trimmed). And then for some there\u2019s a reason they have the body they have. \n\nOverall its easy to say they\u2019re hungry, greedy, not hungry, insecure, whatever. That doesn\u2019t help get to the root cause. Shaming in any form is the worst thing you can do. If you\u2019re not ready to have a healthy conversation about it, then don\u2019t and instead just listen. That in itself goes a long way. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not just about the things the person can do as an individual. Example, I love it when my friends say let\u2019s go for a walk, let\u2019s do a stair challenge, come to a free class, we see my guest pass at the gym. Or let\u2019s do a healthy meal plan, a good challenge. Whatever. Saying your fat, wear baggy clothes, and hide your breasts\u2026really! \n\nSuch a jerk. You contributed nothing, while thinking \u201csomeone had to tell him\u201d", "Yta so u went to his house, got in his business, gave him unsolicited advice, got mad when he didn't accept it, and then attacked him for no reason?

Correctly fitted clothes always look best, regardless of size.", "YTA - Oh look, another asshole disguising insults as 'I jUsT wAnT tO hElLp\". Bullshit. We all know it.", "YTA. \n\nThe co-worker was also an asshole for telling him that being fat is \u201chis fault\u201d. I realise a lot of thin people and formerly fat people will probably downvote this but the fact is that it\u2019s a complex issue, and if it wasn\u2019t, then the weight loss industry would have solved it by now. People are desperate to lose weight but most methods offered to them simply do not work or are not sustainable for them in the long term.\n\nHumans are not evolved to live in an environment where high calorie, highly processed foods are readily available and time pressures stop people cooking, add into that sedentary jobs and mental health issues from stress and from the stigma of being overweight, and it\u2019s no wonder that it\u2019s so common. Some people are more susceptible than others due to social, economic and genetic factors.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on here or why he is fat. He may well be depressed, or have other things going on, which make it very difficult for him to lose weight.\n\nTelling him to lose some weight is not helpful unless you\u2019ve got solutions to all of those potential roadblocks. It\u2019s also not your business, you\u2019re not his doctor, you\u2019re clearly just repulsed by his body as evidenced by your mocking him for his \u201cbreasts\u201d.\n\nTLDR don\u2019t go to somebody\u2019s house and lecture them about their weight. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on with them. Your health is not their business, it\u2019s not affecting you and you\u2019re really just saying \u201cI find your fatness gross\u201d which is your own fat phobia and not his problem.", "Hmm I wonder how many people kickstart sustainable healthy lifestyles because their friends or family members made unsolicited cruel comments about their body. I\u2019m guessing the number is v low. \n\nYTA - if you\u2019re worried about his health, be supportive. Be his gym buddy. Go for hikes together.

Seems like you were just waiting for the opportunity to jump in with your opinion, rather than being motivated by care and concern for him. \n\nIf you really care about his health, offer to partner with him, or have hima over for a game night with only healthy food that you've prepared to show him healthy can be tasty.", "Yep YTA. Patronising to boot.", "Why is the woman trash for not wanting to date a fat person, but you're not trash for lecturing him on his weight?\nEveryone has preferences when it comes to dating. She's not trash for preferring people who aren't obese.", "YTA. What a bunch of fatophobs. Poor guy. Just because someone is fat, it's not an excuse to hurle insults at him and be hateful and insulting.

Why don\u2019t you mind your own fucking business. This is my goddamn house.\n\nHe\u2019s 100% right. STFU. \n\nLike every smoker or addict, every very overweight person knows it\u2019s unhealthy and they need to change. Expressing a concern for their health is reasonable - **once** - but to continue to badger them is most definitely going to piss anyone off. \n\nPeople act in quite unhealthy ways for a myriad of reasons that are a reflection of much deeper issues. You can\u2019t tell a depressed person to just choose to be happy. Or just smile more. That\u2019s effectively what you\u2019re saying to your BIL.\n\nThe baggy clothes and breast comments were WAY over the top as they had nothing to do with your concern for his health and were just personal digs.", "YTA.\n\nIf you had stopped at the \"it's for your own health\" part, it'd be fine.

It\u2019s always obnoxious when someone claims they insulted a fat person because they \u201ccare\u201d about them.

I wonder if you're so delusional as to actually think you're helping? No, I don't think so. I think the more likely option, the reason most people like you act like this, is that you think you can get free shots in. You see, there are people in our world that are just shit stains on humanity. They take pleasure from causing people pain. But it's hard because if you just insulted anyone it might negatively impact your social standing. But then someone comes around or something happens that gives trash like you an excuse to be cruel. Just enough justification in your mind that you think you can get away with it and so you just lay into them because you love to hurt people. You don't care about him, you never did, so stop lying to yourself and just embrace the fact that you're one of those people, and less than human.", "YTA\n\nGoogle \u201cEmpathy\u201d.\n\nWhile the OP is the quintessentially perfect manifestation of humanity, those around you will sometimes have flaws.", "I know you are trying to help, but ESH a depressed & overweight person knows they are overweight, they don\u2019t need someone to ridicule them, it may have the opposite effect & cause them to isolate & eat comfort food.

If you stuck with \"the woman was trash, but I'm worried about your health,\" without lecturing, that would be one thing maybe. Though even then you'd do MUCH better to opt for, \"I'm sorry this happened, this sucks. If you still want to vent, I'll do my best to listen without judgment.\" And if you then did just that, maybe you'd understand him better and were actually able to help him.\n\nMaking offensive comments about his looks and his clothes? Never the way to go. That does nothing to help him. That's just you telling him he doesn't match your idea of what he/a man his age should be. And yeah, maybe you're worried about his health, but then tackle this separately from subjects like his clothing or his dating life or whatnot. Also, think hard first whether it's your place to express these worries. This may be a difficult, even painful subject for him to discuss. He's subjected to fatphobia. He feels it's impossible for him to lose weight. He may be struggling with a bunch of factors that you know nothing about that objectively make it very difficult for him to get thinner.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that incorrectly handled weight loss can be as bad for one's health as being overweight. And if we're not talking about a morbidly obese individual who has trouble moving around a room without outside help, chances are it's not, like, THAT bad for his health. People are built differently. I've known a few rather healthy overweight people, I've known people with perfect IMT who were chronically ill to the point of disability. Every situation needs to be judged individually.\n\nAnother important thing to note is that shaming is SUPER unlikely to help anyone lose weight.  A lot of people gain weight because they overeat to cope with stress. Shaming and humiliation causes stress. So guess what a person ends up doing when someone stresses them? A hint: it's not dieting and exercising. Also, even without overeating, situations like this make a person's cortisol levels go up, and high cortisol makes it way harder to lose/control weight. So if your motivation was to help him get his weight down because you're worried about his health? Congratulations, you've successfully sabotaged your own objective.\n\nAlso, let's just recap.

Yet no matter how many times I tell myself to do the task, I simply can't. \n\nThe easiest way to explain it is like this: for you, and most neurotypicals, making a decision is like walking into a room and flicking the light switch. The room instantly lights up, nice and bright. If it's a habit, it's like walking into a room with motion sensing lights that turn on the instant you're in the room. For those of us with ADHD, there are definitely no motion sensing lights. So we walk in the room and flick the light switch. It's a major gamble on if the lights will turn on or not. Sometimes the light turns on nice and bright and we can do the task. Sometimes it flickers like crazy, and even when on its dim as fuck... We might be able to do the task, but it will cost us a shit ton of energy, and make it near impossible to accomplish any other tasks. And sometimes, when we flick the switch, the light stays dark. It doesn't even flicker. No blinking. So dim light. Nothing at all. The room is pitch black. And we cannot do the task. No matter how much we want to, no matter how many times we flick the switch. So we spend hours, days, weeks, months, and sometimes years, trying to find the problem. We swap the bulbs (ADHD meds), check the breaker (self help stuff like routines, setting alarms, etc), higher a professional to check the wiring (psychiatrists, family doctors, phycologists, etc)... And nothing seems to work. The light is still hit or miss. \n\nAdd on the fact that the more times in a day we flick the switch (the more tasks we have in a day) the more likely it is that the light won't work properly. Also sometimes we need the light to be super bright (task that takes high amount of energy/focus/motivation) and the brighter the light, the higher the chances of the light misbehaving later. Also, the more times we use the light or the brighter we need the light, the more likely we are to blow a fuse (end up in a meltdown or shut down that results in not being able to get the light turned on for days or weeks after). \n\nI wish it was as simple as \"it's not hard to...\" Or the phrase I often here of \"just do it\".
