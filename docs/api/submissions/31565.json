This roommate had breasts like a girl. That roommate eats the same thing everyday and that's so bad because he's already fat!\n\nI had to sit him down last week and explain to him that he's hurting others feelings. I had to explain how intent is different than impact. And other peoples feelings matter, not your own, when it comes to talking about their life. You're not talking about your life.  It's ok to care but it's not your business to shove your thoughts onto him and shame him. If he wants to live his life like that, let him. He was sad. You didn't need to tear him down more. You could have said \"I'm sorry. How can I help you right now?\" or something HELPFUL. He's already aware he's fat. He's already aware he has breasts. He doesn't need you harping on it.\n\nYTA\n\nPS my client has the intellectual capacity of an 8 year old in a 50 something year old mans body.", "YTA \n\nThere are many reasons people are in the shape they are in. Slim, trim, beefy, thick, whatever. Some it\u2019s just their natural body (my dads side is thick, my moms is super trimmed). And then for some there\u2019s a reason they have the body they have. \n\nOverall its easy to say they\u2019re hungry, greedy, not hungry, insecure, whatever. That doesn\u2019t help get to the root cause. Shaming in any form is the worst thing you can do. If you\u2019re not ready to have a healthy conversation about it, then don\u2019t and instead just listen. That in itself goes a long way. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not just about the things the person can do as an individual. Example, I love it when my friends say let\u2019s go for a walk, let\u2019s do a stair challenge, come to a free class, we see my guest pass at the gym. Or let\u2019s do a healthy meal plan, a good challenge. Whatever. Saying your fat, wear baggy clothes, and hide your breasts\u2026really! \n\nSuch a jerk. You contributed nothing, while thinking \u201csomeone had to tell him\u201d", "Yta so u went to his house, got in his business, gave him unsolicited advice, got mad when he didn't accept it, and then attacked him for no reason?

Correctly fitted clothes always look best, regardless of size.", "YTA - Oh look, another asshole disguising insults as 'I jUsT wAnT tO hElLp\". Bullshit. We all know it.", "YTA. \n\nThe co-worker was also an asshole for telling him that being fat is \u201chis fault\u201d. I realise a lot of thin people and formerly fat people will probably downvote this but the fact is that it\u2019s a complex issue, and if it wasn\u2019t, then the weight loss industry would have solved it by now. People are desperate to lose weight but most methods offered to them simply do not work or are not sustainable for them in the long term.\n\nHumans are not evolved to live in an environment where high calorie, highly processed foods are readily available and time pressures stop people cooking, add into that sedentary jobs and mental health issues from stress and from the stigma of being overweight, and it\u2019s no wonder that it\u2019s so common. Some people are more susceptible than others due to social, economic and genetic factors.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on here or why he is fat. He may well be depressed, or have other things going on, which make it very difficult for him to lose weight.\n\nTelling him to lose some weight is not helpful unless you\u2019ve got solutions to all of those potential roadblocks.

You don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on with them. Your health is not their business, it\u2019s not affecting you and you\u2019re really just saying \u201cI find your fatness gross\u201d which is your own fat phobia and not his problem.", "Hmm I wonder how many people kickstart sustainable healthy lifestyles because their friends or family members made unsolicited cruel comments about their body. I\u2019m guessing the number is v low. \n\nYTA - if you\u2019re worried about his health, be supportive. Be his gym buddy. Go for hikes together.

Seems like you were just waiting for the opportunity to jump in with your opinion, rather than being motivated by care and concern for him. \n\nIf you really care about his health, offer to partner with him, or have hima over for a game night with only healthy food that you've prepared to show him healthy can be tasty.", "Yep YTA. Patronising to boot.", "Why is the woman trash for not wanting to date a fat person, but you're not trash for lecturing him on his weight?\nEveryone has preferences when it comes to dating. She's not trash for preferring people who aren't obese.", "YTA. What a bunch of fatophobs. Poor guy. Just because someone is fat, it's not an excuse to hurle insults at him and be hateful and insulting.

Why don\u2019t you mind your own fucking business. This is my goddamn house.\n\nHe\u2019s 100% right. STFU. \n\nLike every smoker or addict, every very overweight person knows it\u2019s unhealthy and they need to change. Expressing a concern for their health is reasonable - **once** - but to continue to badger them is most definitely going to piss anyone off. \n\nPeople act in quite unhealthy ways for a myriad of reasons that are a reflection of much deeper issues. You can\u2019t tell a depressed person to just choose to be happy. Or just smile more. That\u2019s effectively what you\u2019re saying to your BIL.\n\nThe baggy clothes and breast comments were WAY over the top as they had nothing to do with your concern for his health and were just personal digs.", "YTA.\n\nIf you had stopped at the \"it's for your own health\" part, it'd be fine.

You asked him why he seemed upset, he answered honestly, and then you were condescending and insulted him in his own house during a family gathering. It\u2019s always obnoxious when someone claims they insulted a fat person because they \u201ccare\u201d about them. Weight and mental health are closely connected for many of us, but so many people are convinced that \u201ctough love,\u201d i.e. insensitive comments, is somehow going to make a fat person have an epiphany and snap them out of all the emotional turmoil that caused the weight gain. The truth is it has the exact opposite effect. Stop pretending like you give a damn.

Clueless.", "YTA! Fat people know we're fat. We don't need you rubbing it in our faces. You were a guest in his house and then you got in his face and screamed about his man boobs.

I wonder if you're so delusional as to actually think you're helping? No, I don't think so. I think the more likely option, the reason most people like you act like this, is that you think you can get free shots in. You see, there are people in our world that are just shit stains on humanity. They take pleasure from causing people pain. But it's hard because if you just insulted anyone it might negatively impact your social standing. But then someone comes around or something happens that gives trash like you an excuse to be cruel. Just enough justification in your mind that you think you can get away with it and so you just lay into them because you love to hurt people.

If you stuck with \"the woman was trash, but I'm worried about your health,\" without lecturing, that would be one thing maybe. Though even then you'd do MUCH better to opt for, \"I'm sorry this happened, this sucks. If you still want to vent, I'll do my best to listen without judgment.\" And if you then did just that, maybe you'd understand him better and were actually able to help him.\n\nMaking offensive comments about his looks and his clothes? Never the way to go. That does nothing to help him. That's just you telling him he doesn't match your idea of what he/a man his age should be. And yeah, maybe you're worried about his health, but then tackle this separately from subjects like his clothing or his dating life or whatnot. Also, think hard first whether it's your place to express these worries. This may be a difficult, even painful subject for him to discuss. He's subjected to fatphobia. He feels it's impossible for him to lose weight. He may be struggling with a bunch of factors that you know nothing about that objectively make it very difficult for him to get thinner.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that incorrectly handled weight loss can be as bad for one's health as being overweight. And if we're not talking about a morbidly obese individual who has trouble moving around a room without outside help, chances are it's not, like, THAT bad for his health. People are built differently. I've known a few rather healthy overweight people, I've known people with perfect BMI who were chronically ill to the point of disability. Every situation needs to be judged individually.\n\nAnother important thing to note is that shaming is SUPER unlikely to help anyone lose weight.  A lot of people gain weight because they overeat to cope with stress. Shaming and humiliation causes stress. So guess what a person ends up doing when someone stresses them? A hint: it's not dieting and exercising. Also, even without overeating, situations like this make a person's cortisol levels go up, and high cortisol makes it way harder to lose/control weight.

Yet no matter how many times I tell myself to do the task, I simply can't. \n\nThe easiest way to explain it is like this: for you, and most neurotypicals, making a decision is like walking into a room and flicking the light switch. The room instantly lights up, nice and bright. If it's a habit, it's like walking into a room with motion sensing lights that turn on the instant you're in the room. For those of us with ADHD, there are definitely no motion sensing lights. So we walk in the room and flick the light switch. It's a major gamble on if the lights will turn on or not. Sometimes the light turns on nice and bright and we can do the task. Sometimes it flickers like crazy, and even when on its dim as fuck... We might be able to do the task, but it will cost us a shit ton of energy, and make it near impossible to accomplish any other tasks. And sometimes, when we flick the switch, the light stays dark. It doesn't even flicker. No blinking. So dim light. Nothing at all. The room is pitch black. And we cannot do the task. No matter how much we want to, no matter how many times we flick the switch. So we spend hours, days, weeks, months, and sometimes years, trying to find the problem. We swap the bulbs (ADHD meds), check the breaker (self help stuff like routines, setting alarms, etc), higher a professional to check the wiring (psychiatrists, family doctors, phycologists, etc)... And nothing seems to work. The light is still hit or miss. \n\nAdd on the fact that the more times in a day we flick the switch (the more tasks we have in a day) the more likely it is that the light won't work properly. Also sometimes we need the light to be super bright (task that takes high amount of energy/focus/motivation) and the brighter the light, the higher the chances of the light misbehaving later. Also, the more times we use the light or the brighter we need the light, the more likely we are to blow a fuse (end up in a meltdown or shut down that results in not being able to get the light turned on for days or weeks after). \n\nI wish it was as simple as \"it's not hard to...\" Or the phrase I often here of \"just do it\".

There are people who are attracted to fat people.  Dressing sharp is what is needed here, not \"loose clothing.\"  Loose clothing just makes you look shapeless and also larger than you are. Good hygiene, well dressed, and being happy with yourself and your life is what you need to be successful in dating.  \n\\- Even though every skinny person who ever shamed a fat person always says, \"I'm worried about your health!\" that's actually bullshit.  If BIL was skinny but had exactly the same health risks, you wouldn't say shit to him. What you don't like is that he doesn't fit your aesthetic ideal.  And unless he asks you specifically what changes he needs to make for *you* to want to fuck him, you don't get an opinion on the relative attractiveness of his body.   \n\\- All fat people already know they are fat.

Or acknowledge what he might be feeling \"that sounds really awful to go through/you sound sad.\" Or \"man that sucks, do you want me to just listen and empathize or are you open to suggestions?\" (Any suggestions should be constructive, still not a call for cruelty)", "I would hope not since this is very vague and I change a lot of details.", "The real problem is that ready to wear clothes are made to fit the widest range of human bodies. So something that \"fits\" you (is approximately the right size to keep all your bits in) is very different than something that *fits* you (takes into account your specific body shape: measurements, proportions, contours, asymmetries and fleshy human bits, and fits exactly over those).\n\nWhen people say well-fitted clothes look best, they are talking about the second one.", "I just went through an overalls phase and it was heaven.\n\nNow I\u2019m on to baggy shirt dresses and leggings.\n\nMy tummy is not interested in being squished any further in this life.", "Exactly, what clothes you wear should be personal preference. If baggy is comfortable, wear baggy, if fitted makes you feel good, wear fitted.\n\nI also don't see any issue with people of any size making a conscious decision to wear clothes that show skin - crop tops, low rise, etc. But it should be a conscious decision, one \"look\" that I think doesn't flatter anybody, but especially fat people is when you have a roll or two hanging out and it's not part of the style of the outfit, like you can tell the shirt is tight and the fabric is pulling in several places, and it's lifting up and showing skin. But that's me applying my personal judgement and what I think is and isn't attractive, it would still be an asshole move for me to lecture a fat person about that.\n\nAnd I say all this as someone who was 115kg (5'2\" female) down to 80kg and still working on it, slowly learning to strike a balance between what feels physically comfortable, practical for the work I do, aesthetically pleasing to me personally and the people I want to impress, and appropriate to be seen in public.", "Idk, if you keep your mouth shut in these situations I\u2019d say you\u2019re doing better than 95% of people.", "I lost around 30 lbs in a year when I started to eat less. It kind of levelled off at 150lbs. Still overweight. I had an eating disorder. I said fuck it and started eating however much I wanted whenever I wanted. It still gets hard sometimes, especially if someone mentions my weight, but I try. It\u2019s not like I over eat. I just don\u2019t wake up in the morning starving anymore. I\u2019m back up to 180lbs I think. I haven\u2019t weighed myself in a few years. \n\nI want to go to the gym and start working out. My goal is to bulk up, not lose weight. I\u2019m worried to go to the gym in case someone approaches me with weight loss tips. Going to the gym is hard because no matter how much I *want* to go I\u2019ll go for two days then be out for a month because I just don\u2019t have the energy or ability to actually work out. (I know this because my job has a private gym with a few machines but they aren\u2019t very good for what I want)", "What? No it's not. In this thread I've learned to just eat less calories. Simple.", "Because those people like to feel superior to others about something. And since they are AHs they only get it by picking on others.", "This sub isn\u2019t \u201cam I wrong?\u201d it\u2019s \u201cam I the asshole?\u201d.\n\nWhether right or wrong about his weight he was the asshole.\n\nYou can be right and an asshole.", "It does not cause scurvy. You have been brainwashed. I've literally watched testimonies of people who have been eating that way for decades and are healthier than they've ever been. Type 2 diabetes reversed, cancer reversed, hypertension reversed, insulin resistance gone, obesity gone..how is it thousands of people eat this way and their stories are all the same. People were created to eat a diet of animal based diets. Not processed sugars and carbs. Why do you think obesity is at a all time high, cancer all time high, heart disease, ECT...just think about it. Listen to Dr Berry on YouTube and there's many other Drs that have researched it as well. This way of eating will not cause death, but what will cause death is eating nothing but sugar and carbs. Another thing humans were made to do is feast and fast. Our bodies aren't made to eat multiple meals per day. Just think about it instead of calling me misinformed..", "If you are worried about scurvy take a vitamin c supplement it's really that simple \ud83d\ude02", "Maybe. Maybe not. He probably just has nobody to vent to but his brother.", "I love when they play the \"concerned about you being unhealthy\" game, it's funny because people who are mentally/emotionally/spiritually healthy simply DONT behave this way toward others.", "I have been known to respond with \"what?! Really?! I never noticed. Thanks for telling me! \ud83d\ude44\"", "I've been on both sides of the scales and I'd be put in the thin category and I agree that I've heard a shocking amount of other thin people say about fat people, I tend to just walk away", "Reddit in general hates fat people", "Oh, that sucks!! I\u2019m Canadian so we don\u2019t have that for profit motivation in our health care system - it would just take you two years to see someone /s", "I've rocked the leggings and tunics (with cute boots) all my life - literally through thick and thin. \n\nI totally agree with the wear what you like and what you feel comfortable in - physically and emotionally.", "It never makes sense to me that people understand anorexia as the illness it is. But, when someone is morbidly obese they think they are just lazy, no willpower, etc. Not thinking of it as also an illness. Disordered eating whether too much or too little are both complex medical issues. Sure, there are those that don't take anorexia seriously. But, overnight people are often the target of unsolicited and incorrect \"advice\".", "I decided to rewatch Murder She Wrote because of that episode. It\u2019s delightful!", "It is when you literally work out for hours multiple times a week and are still overweight while practically starving yourself. \ud83d\ude10\n\nIt was my sister. Her weight was caused by pcos. She\u2019s on multiple medications to help her lose weight because she was pre diabetic. But of course it was just because she wasn\u2019t working hard enough. \ud83d\ude44 it\u2019s a prime example of fat phobia in medicine. Ignoring the condition causing the weight issues while trying to fix the weight issues.", "It's actually medically proven that shaming and picking on people about their weight makes the issue worse. Their \"care\" is them trying to feel superior by bringing others down. Which is a horrid personality trait.", "I see you've met my parents. \"CAN'T I SAY MY OPINION?? I CAN HAVE AN OPINION!!!\"\n\n...On stuff that's none of your business, that nobody asked your opinion on? Well I guess technically you *can*, but then it's rich to get butthurt when the response isn't nice \ud83e\udd23", "Legit. Shame tends to *literally* make it worse, if anything, because a lot of people with weight problems are emotional eaters. If you upset them, they will eat *more*, because that's how their brain has been wired to cope with being upset.", "I do my best. Sometimes, when I'm angry, I have trouble controlling my tone and come across more combative than that. Which doesn't necessarily change anyone's mind. But maybe I was never going to change anyone's mind anyway. Like I said, people really don't want to give up this punching bag. They're holding on tight to this particular form of discrimination.", "My wife is dealing with the same and it\u2019s so frustrating. You don\u2019t wanna be worrying about clothing when ill ANYWAY, and also trying to figure out if you\u2019re \u201cdone\u201d or if you\u2019ll keep changing sizes\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s \u201clucky\u201d she doesn\u2019t need work clothes because we\u2019d be shopping constantly.", "I remember reading it back in the day and thinking that  the the book seemed pretty sensible. She wasn't recommending wild crash diets or punishing workouts. She encouraged a healthy lifestyle and taking care of yourself.", "This. I have been through a couple of traumatising and stressful events in my life so far. During the first one, I lost a lot of weight and literally looked ill. During this second one, I have gained weight. Both times I've eaten less than usual because of stress. The effects and impact of stress aren't linear.", "I have struggled with my weight forever.  Shaming someone because they\u2019re obese doesn\u2019t work.  I had medical issues that were preventing me from losing weight.  Instead of shaming him, ask him if he would like to go for walks, to the gym, to the pool.  Deep water aerobics are so stress free on the body and joints.  All he may need is a friend to be support.  Not hard.", "I had a coworker constantly making comments about my body ( I\u2019m thin and curvy) she would say things like \u2018 what I could do if I had a body like yours\u2019 made me very uncomfortable. It wasn\u2019t just once, it was a few times a week. I finally got tired of it and told my supervisor. They had a talk with her and she stopped talking to me which was great but I also found out that she switched to saying nasty things about me to coworkers. Thank goodness I moved and switched jobs a year later. (Not because of her but because of family matters)", "No, you might not change their minds but it shows them that you won\u2019t put up with that bs. Sometimes I may have a harsh tone when I do say something but I really don\u2019t care it\u2019s their problem for saying ugly things in the first place.
