He got me my first job at 18 at his brother's company and also taught me how to use every type of power tool, which helped a lot with me not being too green at the job when I first joined. He was an awesome guy and was my drinking/sports buddy for a few years once I turned 21.  \n\n\nWhen I was 25 tho he sadly passed away due to a heart attack, it was sudden and hard on everyone, especially my stepbrothers who were both really close with him. I really do wish I could have stayed and been there longer to help them out, but 6 or 7 months after he passed my job gave me an offer to be a head director at a new parent company. The catch was that it was a whole state away and like a 7 or 8 hour drive away from my hometown.  \n\n\nI took the job and moved up there, my mom was getting up there in age and after about a year up there I was finally able to convince her to move up here to and live close to me. We don't live together but she lives maybe 5 miles away and has a caretaker basically on speedidal.  Once I moved I have never made it back down to that city, other than one time for a meeting at the old company. Its been 4 years since my step dad died and I didn't really keep in touch with either of my stepbrothers, I sent them both Christmas and birthday cards and would text them sometimes but I hadn't called them in close to 2 years.  IK they could have called or texted me but I do realize that it was sorta more my responsibility cause I was the one that left when things were still pretty raw.  \n\n\nI didn't even notice but about 2 or 3 days ago my step brother was in town visiting my mom and came by to visit me too the same day. We talked for a bit but I don't think he meant to but he let it slip that he was still sorta mad that I left \"so soon\" after the passing and took my mom with me.  I apologized for leaving so abruptly but got kinda defensive and straight up asked him \"what did you want me to do?  Let the opportunity just slip through my fingers?  He got pretty defensive at this and this is where I might be TA I said something like \"he was YOUR dad not mine\".  I could  tell he got pretty upset at what I said but dropped it.  He stayed for about an hour later before he had to hit the road since he was traveling up a bit farther than where we were.  \n\n\nWhen he left my GF said I was way way way too harsh on him but I just dont know what to think RN.

This is something which he really had no reason to lay on you. Life goes on after the death of a loved one. It makes no sense to have stuck around for what exactly?

He has a right to his feelings, and they probably got stuck because everything is so amplified when you're grieving. It may not be rational, but he gets to be upset his whole family disappeared mid-grief.\n\nYou weren't at all wrong to move on with your own life. Wouldn't have been even if you did consider him your father (and this is why I think you were a bit too harsh). Life's for the living, you did exactly right, and your SF seems like a great guy and would probably have wanted you to go.

But ouch. \n\nWhat you said aside, he was expressing his hurt and feelings of abandonment, and you went overboard probably because you did have some guilt about it. A much kinder way to put it could have been, \u201cyeah, the timing wasn\u2019t great. But with your dad gone, I suddenly became the sole provider to my mom, and an opportunity came up where I\u2019d be able to get her what she needed, so I felt like I needed to take it.

You're in your 20s, your stepfather passed, most of a year later you move a state away because you got a big opportunity. I get that your stepbrother (also presumably an adult) was close with his father, but him being close with his father doesnt mean his stepbrother and stepmom have to mourn by his side for years to come, and it doesnt mean you should give up career opportunities half a year after. You brought up a good point, if you and your mom being in his life was so important to him, he could visit more or just pick up the phone. You may be the one who moved away but that doesnt mean its only on you to stay in touch. All that being said, its completely understandable him wanting y'all in his life, and everyone grieves at their own pace.", "NAH.

And your mom is not a piece of luggage--if she didn't want to move near you she didn't have to.  You didn't \"take\" her away from her stepsons.\n\nBut they lost their dad and then practically lost their step-mom too.  Depending on their relationship with her, and whether their mom is still around, their loss was bigger than yours.\n\nSaying \"he was your dad not mine\" was cruel, and not even on point.  Staying in that town after he died has nothing to do with how close you were to him.  You said it as pushback for your step-brother blaming you for your mom moving away from them.", "Yta, there was no need to say this.", "Yeah...YTA. He was looking for some kind of connection to the life you all shared and he knew his father meant something to you.  He was probably hoping to restart your relationship as he's likely feeling quite alone in the world without both his dad and your mom.  \n\nYou were an older brother to him.

You have to live your life. But you're the one who got defensive and seems to have not given two shits about your step family.", "Yta if only because you are disregarding their point of view. After their dad passed, their step-mom and brother left their lives too. 21 and 23 is very young to lose a parent and become distanced from the surviving family.", "YTA\n\nIf he just mentioned it in passing, you could have just let it go. People grieve in their own way. You don't say how close they were to your mom. \n\nGrief and anger can be mixed together. You could have been softer on him. You got angry and nasty.", "NTA. You stated the truth.\n\nThis is a case of misery likes company. \nThey needed to mourn how they needed to mourn and you being there wouldn\u2019t have made any difference.", "NTA\n\nI assume that your step brothers are now above the age of 21 since they visited your mother without adult supervision :-)\n\nThey had unreasonable expectations. It is not as if you fled in the middle of the funeral. You left a fairly long period of time after the death of your step father. Even if it had been your biological father, people need to get on with their lives.\n\nAnd realistically your mother chose to move to be near you and logistically it also made sense since you appear to be assuming somewhat of the role of making sure her life is on track as she ages. You didn't steal her from them.\n\nAnd my point about his being an adult is that he needs to grow up emotionally and realize the world isn't all about him. For the most part people \"grieve\" people differently depending on their relationship. I was sad when my bio aunts and uncles died but it wasn't nearly the emotional hurricane that I felt when my parents died. That is only natural degrees of grief and something that an adult should have realized without being told.", "YTA. Come on man, taking away their stepmother right after they lost their father was kinda a dick move, but then not seeing them for 2+ years and then when they do come out and try to rebuild a connection with you, you get in an argument with them and say their dad was not yours is just downright cruel.", "NTA", "NTA but you could have responded with some sort of tenderness towards the guy. \n\nHe had no idea why someone he thought of as his brother just up and vanished out of his life when he wanted the comfort of his family during the grieving process.\n\n\"Yeah I miss him too, I regret that I couldn't have been there at the time but this opportunity was important for me to take for my future\".", "YTA for the dad comment, most people see dads as more than just biology, so I would have also been taken back, as it sounds like your stepbrother was. To be honest though it sounds like you both just got a little defensive and it escalated. I would just apologise and ask that he did the same.", "INFO:  Do they still have their mother and, perhaps, a stepfamily or extended family back in your hometown?", "YTA. Not for moving of course. But for being defensive and way too harsh on stepbro, and for not keeping better in touch.", "NTA your relationship can\u2019t have ever been close when neither side has really felt the need to call or text outside of holidays and birthdays.  \n\nPlus six months is actually the time a \u2018healthy grieving process\u2019 takes according to the experts. So it was probably both fortunate and healthy for you to take that opportunity. \n\nYou invited your mother and she mad her own decision, you didn\u2019t steal her away. If their relationship had been as good and close as yours, or if she\u2019d felt she\u2019d be able to depend on them like on you, then she\u2019d have stayed.  But she didn\u2019t. And perhaps she needed to get away from living in a house filled with constant reminders.\n\nAnd lastly you were correct: he wasn\u2019t t your dad.\n\nYou cared for him and he for you, but as he himself had made clear: he was Not your dad.\n\nHe was your stepbrother\u2019s dad, so of course they will feel more strongly but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you Did and Said nothing wrong or untrue.", "NTA. Sounds like a good guy but he was not your dad. Life goes on and you got to look out for yourself.", "YTA. He has a right to be upset. He was talking about his feelings here, and your mom leaving them all to come to you was probably not easy on him. Plus the guy might not be your dad, but you clearly cared about him, and even if you didn't, there was no need to be so crass about it. Your reaction lacked basic empathy and was needlessly harsh when such harshness was not warranted. All you had to do was stick to the facts, that you had a job opportunity too good to pass and despite everything happening, life needs to go on.", "Soft YTA He was just letting you know how he felt. He lost a dad and he seems to have felt like he lost a brother when you left. Send him a text or give him a call and explain things better.", "It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s the AH. Call him and apologize. Or write. Tell him the nice things you said about your SF here. There\u2019s no benefit to leaving this at hard feelings and he travelled all that way to visit your mother, so he clearly thinks the steps are meaningful in his life. \n\nNeither of you are wrong, his heart is just in the relationship more.", "ESH.\n\nYou have to grieve in different ways and means.  You may not have taken their feelings into consideration when you went.  You definitely had your reasons; some people are just more career focused.  That said, you didn't have to be a dick, and you definitely crossed the line because it sounds like your stepdad was pretty fuckin good to you.", "NTA.

In their moms side I think", "Maybe because he lost his entire family structure in a period of months.", "In my opinion it means something similar. And I'm pretty sure, his stepbrother interpreted this message as if OP had no feelings for the man. Communication is what the other person hears. It sounds for me as if stepbrother was hurt because he considered OP more as family than Op considered them. \n\nCommunication is hard.", "Thank you. \n\nThen very mild YTA for your insensitivity.", "A year and a half is not just a period of months. It was 6 or 7 before he got the offer. Probably another one or two until he left and then a year after that is when his mom made the move. Not everyone\u2019s lives can stop indefinitely and he can move if he wanted to.", "do step brothers not have a mother of their own that you think they lost their entire family structure when OP moved 6-7 months after step dad died and then moved their own mom (not the step brothers' mom) to be closer to OP a year later (so 1.5 years after step father died)?", "So he took it the wrong way? He assumed OP meant something he didn't? The stepbrother needs to communicate. A father figure and a dad are different. And it seems OP has never referred to step dad as dad, so I'm not sure what the stepbrother is thinking. Never been called dad by OP, but they had a close relationship, like an uncle and nephew, not as close as stepdads children, so not a father son relationship. The dad died when they were all over 20. Not children, and the whole \"consider him family\" they didn't contact him for TWO YEARS. It's not on OP at all, he sent Christmas and birthday cards which gives the receiving person an excuse to start a conversation which never happened apparently. He got a better job offer, in the field the stepdad got him in to and accepted, half a year after he died. One would argue the dead guy would want his to take the job. Another whole year later he moved his aging mom closer do he could care for her, while still trying, even a miniscule amount(Christmas and birthday cards), to stay in contact. Communication goes both ways and the stepbrother/s shouldn't be upset OP grieved his own way, he didn't say \"we aren't family\" just that the stepdad was not OP's dad, which does not at all equal that OP doesn't consider him family. It's honestly on the stepbrother, he was upset OP didn't grieve just like him when they didn't have the same relationship. If you read the post it sounds like OP was done grieving before he left, \"I wish I could've stayed to help out.\" Yes they need to communicate but the stepbrother sooo much more"]}
