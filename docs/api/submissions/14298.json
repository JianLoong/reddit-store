The adults were way more inappropriate than the child who heard his mom being called a sex slave and his dad a slave owner. \n\nOP, these people are so comfortable having these disgusting conversations literally anywhere. Please protect your children and go no contact with anyone actively participating in these conversations and anyone passively allowing it to happen (ie anyone who isn\u2019t standing up and telling them they are disgusting and racist and need to GTFO). \n\nIt is very harmful for your children to be around people who degrade their parents. And worse if the example they see from you two is that you will tolerate it as long as you\u2019re not within earshot. Please do better for your kids.\n\n**I think a conversation with your son about how proud you are for standing up for his parents is in order. And then apologize to him that *you* didn\u2019t do it first, as you should have.**\n\nNTA unless you continue to subject your family to these people.", "Yep! Ask your parents (if alive) how Juliet will be punished for years of grossly racist comments. \n\nAsk the offenders their plan for making restitution to your family and especially your son. \n\nOnly once everyone who has witnessed this behavior and laughed along or looked away has apologized (properly! What I did wrong/how I will try to fix\u2014none of that \u201csorry you were offended\u201dBS) should you consider even allowing these people to get any of you and your family\u2019s time or attention. \n\nNTA\u2014but you will be if you don\u2019t take a strong stand to protect your son and wife from your vile family who prefer decorum to justice.", "Exactly. I'm surprised that you kid didn't do worse.", "That's racism and your son was pretty much offended. Play stupid games, get your stupid wedding toppers drowned in pee and poo.", "What was wrong with the way he expressed them?\n\nThey were being insulting toward his family so little dude got some goated revenge", "They had a discussion about it. They were being racist and insulting his mother, he could of done MUCH worse.", "Op spoke with him regarding it being wrong. Just because he didn\u2019t give him a punishment doesn\u2019t mean his son didn\u2019t learn that it was wrong.", "Punishing him is not the only way to teach him something. This isn't 1943.", "Racist don\u2019t get apologies", "Op had a talk with his son why it was wrong to respond that way. He learning to deal with idiots. You dont have to discipline him to make him understand that it was wrong.", "Nah you shouldn't assume you can say whatever you want and get no consequences. If they didn't start shit there wouldn't be shit. Maybe they should think of it as a teachable moment for themselves and shut their mouths.", "No he shouldn't be disciplined. OP explained he was wrong and he need to ask to go next time. There's no need to punish him...", "Nah\u2026not for racists. You say something racist about members of your family within hearing of an 11 yo who is the subject of the racism, I\u2019d do a hell of a lot more than throw your stupid figurines in the toilet. Their behavior is reprehensible. What do you think an 11 yo child feels when he hears that his mother\u2019s a slave and his father\u2019s a slaveowner? That\u2019s a heavy, fucked up burden, and he should at least be able to be safe around his own damn family.", "I personally think NTA and that is mainly because I feel like people think its okay to say stuff like this and are unafraid of the consequences cause 'you could go to jail'- when in reality, there are going to be people that won't really care. They're going to mouth off one day and get their jaw busted AND deserve it.\n\nDoes this require a talking too? Yes. But a punishment? I can't say it does and that is mainly because what- is he supposed to turn the other cheek to an insult to his race and character? Tolerance went out the window when they felt that sort of stuff was okay to say around a 'kid'.", "His mother being racially abused is a ton more than inappropriate.", "This is not saying something he doesn't like. This is being racist towards the kid's mother while the kid is present.\n\nThey deserved worse.", "Why? The kids was trying to stand up for his parents. there was no need for him to be punished", "If they were genuinely concerned, they could've approached the authorities (at any point in the last 11 years) or contacted a human trafficking charity.", "OP and his wife have been married for 14 years and have children together. The relatives are mocking their relationship by (at best) calling it transactional and reinforcing ridiculous stereotypes about their mother's nationality. That sounds pretty racist to me.", "Because it insinuates that his wife is not equal to him, that she doesn't love him and is using him for the benefits that living in her husband's country gives her, that she only pretends to care about him but doesn't, all because of her ethnicity. Let's be real, if his foreign bride were from, say, Wales, they wouldn't be making these kinds of comments. It is absolutely racially motivated.", "The above comment is a bot copying a comment from u/MotherBike", "Yeah that's my thought; OP didn't sleep on the teaching moment, he's just refusing to *punish* as well.\n\nWhich is appropriate for the child's age and the event. Especially if the child doesn't behave like that otherwise.\n\nNTA, OP.", "I know  all about  being  hated for the color  of your  skin. Racism makes me see fire  engine  red. His behavior  is  understandable  but that doesn't  make  it ethical.  It doesn't  mean he doesn't need discipline."]}
