Ever since I got married my sister Juliet and her husband Mike have been calling my wife a \"mail-order bride,\" \"sex slave\" or \"concubine.\" For this reason, I'm generally no contact with Juliet and Mike; seeing them at family events but trying to avoid interacting with them. My younger sister got married last week and during the ceremony the groom, Robert, was joking with Mike and Juliet about how I was a \"slaveholder\" and all that idiocy. I talked to Robert later and he admitted that he was totally going along with it, not just passively listening to what Juliet and Mike were saying. My 11-year-old son overheard it and, as you could imagine, wasn't happy to hear his father accused of enslaving his mother. So he took the figurines off the wedding cake and threw them in the toilet. He did this in front of everybody and then flipped off the bride and groom. \n\nNow everyone's asking me how I'm going to punish my son. I told them I don't intend to punish him at all. Yeah, he could have handled it better, and I advised him that next time he should just ask to leave. But I'm not going to *punish* him. When adults invite a child to their wedding, insult said child, and are too stupid to make sure the child isn't in earshot, they shouldn't be surprised when said child behaves childishly in response to the insult. I figure that since he's only eleven I'll let him get away with it this time, if he's still doing stuff like this at seventeen there will be major consequences.", "created_utc": 1680980031, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fuyl0/aita_for_refusing_to_punish_my_son/", "score": 16042, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wasn't doing something out of malice. He wasn't doing something to be mean. He wasn't being disrespectful for the sake of disrespect.
