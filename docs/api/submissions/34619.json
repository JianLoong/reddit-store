Prior to dating Jake I was self employed. I bought houses that were in ruin, fixed them and sold them for below market value. I sold my first home at 19. The only reason I was able to become as successful as I was was because I had the help of my dad, my brother and my uncle.

When I met my now husband, I had over $600k saved.\n\nNow, my husband was honestly fantastic. We never stopped laughing and he just made me so damn happy all the time. I tried getting him involved with my business after about a year. He tried but gave up easily because he \"didn't have the skills for this\".

But a month ago I couldn't shake it anymore. I told him \"I'm starting this up again and I really don't care what people have to say about it. I want to do it, I'm doing it.\" He said \"Okay, I support you no matter what\". But then a week or so ago he started talking to me about his business idea and he's like \"yeah so I figured you could manage the whole thing\". I told him I didn't know if I could manage running two operations with a 2yo and he goes \"well I figured you could just put off your thing for a couple years while we see if this works\". I told him I didn't want to put off my thing and he got irritated and said \"this can be OUR thing as a family.

And he goes \"you split all profit with your dad, uncle and brother. I want to start something where we aren't paying other people for their part and we can pocket all profit.\" So, I told him he needed to stop trying to control my life because this is the 2nd year he's tried convincing me not to do something that made me successful to begin with, that I LOVE doing.

End of discussion there. Most businesses close within the first year. He doesn't seem to have the skills or knowledge to be able to run or manage a business and it certainly won't be turning a profit immediately. So, where does he think the money to pay the bills will come from?\n\nNTA. Start flipping houses again. You, your Dad, Uncle and Brother know what you are doing and have been doing it profitably for years. That said, look into putting it into some kind of business structured in such a way that you won't lose it in the event of divorce.\n\nLook, PLENTY of people run businesses and have toddlers. You get a sitter so you can work and all will be fine. I wouldn't take a toddler on a construction site for obvious reasons but there is absolutley no reason you can't continue doing what you have been doing for YEARS. \n\nYou were successful and profitable before your husband was ever involved. Quite honestly, he sounds jealous of your success so he is trying to ruin it for you.", "you're the asshole for trying to bring in money? how?\n\nhow about he shuts the f up and goes back to his nonexistent job and lets his dynamite meal ticket do her thing? put some friggin respect on your name and what youve already done.", "NTA. I am a tad sympathetic to your husband because he feels excluded compared to some (frankly imaginary) business venture you'd doing together. But you have a proven track record of success and a network of support -  your dad, uncle and brother - to make your business happen and that is massively valuable compared to an untested new business. In a few years' time, who knows if your family partners will still be doing work like this. \n\nYour work - which brings a lot of the money into your household - does not need to enable or involve him. He isn't precluded from getting a job or having a career due to your decision, yet he's acting like it is. If at some point you want to go into business with him, great, but I don't blame you for not wanting to right now. He sounds kid of untethered professionally and IDK if it will be wise for you to gamble your joint earning potential and household income - putting all your eggs into one basket as they say.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite the controlling AH that you see him as. You readily admit that he wants you to be happy. He was first concerned about you working with a newborn. That\u2019s not totally out of line. He also brought it an idea that would allow you two to make money without paying part of the profits to others. Also not an AH suggestion. \n\nIt seems like you thoroughly enjoy flipping houses and should pursue that. It also seems that he doesn\u2019t quite appreciate how much you enjoy it. But his concerns/suggestions don\u2019t make him the AH in my view, nor particularly controlling. NAH", "I mean he\u2019s not trying to control your life. Thats an overstatement.\n\nHe wants to create a system where you two get all the money and in-laws aren\u2019t getting a chunk of it. \n\nI think this whole thing was blown out of proportion, largely because you jumped to accusing him of controlling your life.\n\nNAH, but I think you guys should consider getting normal jobs for a bit until your child gets a bit older and you have more time to do \u201cside\u201d work", "Yeah, he\u2019s disregarding your opinions, experience, and incredible success and trying to stuff you into his current idea. It does seem odd that he went from \u201ctough to do that with baby\u201d to \u201cyou can run my entire operation\u201d within a week. Based on the information in your post: NTA", "NTA you are entitled to your own career and your own passions. If your husband wants to pursue something he is welcome to but he doesn't get to force you to put your career on hold to support him in his.", "He's planning an imaginary business that OP should do the actual work for so he can feel he makes money!", "At first I almost felt a little bad for him too, but she tried to get him involved and he quit.  That's fine, it's not for everyone, but don't belittle her for continuing to do it.  He's got issues.", "I'd agree with you if he wasn't persistently trying to get her to stop working with her family.  He's doing his best to be subtle about it.  The common thread in everything he's done or said.\n\nYou may not see it because you're probably an awesome guy who truly cares about his wife's happiness.  This guy isn't and is smart enough to hide his true intentions.  I think he's good at manipulation.", "It's weird for sure.  I almost wonder if he feels intimidated or jealous because her male family members take part in the flipping.", "I don\u2019t have enough fingers to count the number of unwarranted assumptions you just made.", "NTA.\n\nStick with the business that works and is a proven money maker. You, your dad and uncle work well together and make good money. There will be enough challenges getting that business back up and running, while coordinating child care, etc., without introducing any further new elements. \n\nIf your husband wants to work on creating a business plan for himself, he should do that on his own. Or maybe he should concentrate on being a stay at home parent while you re-start your business. \n\nStay firm, OP!", "Your husband is the ahole. You should continue doing house flip. If my wife does that and make alot like you I would encourage her to continue while I will try to learn as well. This way we both could start our own business in it. It a good and profitable career", "NTA, your husband wants you to stay home and not work.  He's succeeding in doing that.  Go back to house flipping put your child in daycare.  The only difference is now you have to modify your hours or have someone watch your child if you are still working.  s for your spouses business that he wants to start, does he have a business plan, do you know what it is or is it sunk cost pipe dream.", "NTA. If you do what he wants, you'll do all the work and he'll be stuffing his pockets with most of the money. He's jealous of your success. That's why he doesn't want you to go back to it. Even if you make his business a success he'll still take credit for it.", "NTA his real problem is that if he doesn't co-own the business, he doesn't get half when you leave him.\n\nHe wants to contribute nothing and leave with half.", "So whats his day job? If you\u2019re managing the business what\u2019s his job in that?\n\n\nGirl I think you married a mooch.", "You, your father and your uncle have proven that you can work together successfully as a team. What is your husband suggesting you do instead? He doesn't have the skills or expertise. Does he expect you to do all the work and he contribute nothing so that you don't have to share the profits with anyone else? Is he suggesting a totally different sort of business? But what? This is what you know and are good at. What can he offer?", "NTA. I hope you have a pre-nup.", "600 k saved? Tell him when he matches it you will be more agreeable to his ideas. In the meantime you will do what has been successful for you. NTA.", "NTA Go for it, but protect your assets.", "NTA - your husband needs to be a grown up and get a job.", "I see both sides. So NAH/ESH? \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US though, good luck with purchasing those properties you plan to flip. \n\nI\u2019ve got flippers in my family and its not the best time in the housing market and there\u2019s definitely plenty of competition with how many people buy and flip houses to sell or for a rental / vacation home. The industry is very different than it was 2 years ago.\n\nEditing to add - I really hope your relatives are licensed construction professionals if you\u2019re saving that much money having them do the repairs.", "NTA. a lot of guys are legit scared of a woman who can take care of herself, and he is being insecure. this will manifest in other ways if he doesn\u2019t understand this", "Is his idea better?  Because he's not wrong, the market is shit right now.", "It seems like he has been supportive of what you want to do for years, but that support isn't reciprocated now that he wants to try something with just the two of you.", "NTA\n\nBut how does he have you laughing when he\u2019s not doing anything to support the family he made. \n\nNo job, doesn\u2019t contribute equally, got you pregnant, and talks you out of doing something you\u2019re great at and makes you happy. \n\nHe sounds like a bum with a \u201cgood personality\u201d that he uses to skate by.", "Tell him to start his business and when it starts to be profitable, you'll come on board to help", "NTA, if house flipping brings you joy, you can afford it, and you\u2019re successful, then do you. He can start his own business without you running it all for him. Stick to your guns!", "Nta", "No you are not. \nNTA\n\nAnd start trusting your intuition.", "Ffs DO NOT invest in his imaginary business.  He sounds like he is insecure about himself and is trying to bring you down and under his control.  He should get a job while you continue flipping. Real estate is always a good investment if you know what you are doing.  It sounds as if you do. And until he gets a full time job he can be the caretaker of his own child and take care of your home.", "NTA He's butt-hurt because he's not \"the man of the house\" making all the money and all the decisions. He wants to start his own business, but make you work for him. Jake needs to get his own job, maybe one where he can boss somebody else around.", "NTA! for all the reasons already stated. \n\nBut also, thank you for house flipping in this economy instead of hoarding houses to rent out like a scumlord.", "NTA. I hope he doesn't have access to your savings.", "NTA.  He's trying to financially control you.  Either by not allowing you to have your own income outside of the house, or by trying to make you work in his business, where he will most likely pocket the profit and then tell you that you don't need any of it.  \n\nDo you do most of the child rearing? Does he not want you to work so he doesn't have to step up?", "NTA. He doesn't know if his idea works. He wants your savings to finance it.\n\nTell him to start his business and you'll continue house flipping.", "INFO: do you put that godawful gray LVP flooring in the houses you flip? If so, automatic Y T A regardless.", "And who's money have they been living off of as he has downtime when switching careers? Who's money would they be using to start his business? Sheesh.", "I'm not sure if we read the same post because hubby is clearly trying to control her work.", "That's what I am thinking too... his manhood is threatened because he lacks necessary skills... that can be taught and learned. and in his proposed business venture OP was still running the whole thing. What does Jake plan to do? He could totally be a part of the house flipping venture if he really wanted to.", "So much for paying you a compliment.\n\nI've seen master manipulors in action.  I see it here.  You see assumptions, I see behavior indicators."]}
