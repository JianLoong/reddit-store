Prior to dating Jake I was self employed. I bought houses that were in ruin, fixed them and sold them for below market value. I sold my first home at 19. The only reason I was able to become as successful as I was was because I had the help of my dad, my brother and my uncle.

When I met my now husband, I had over $600k saved.\n\nNow, my husband was honestly fantastic. We never stopped laughing and he just made me so damn happy all the time. I tried getting him involved with my business after about a year. He tried but gave up easily because he \"didn't have the skills for this\".

But a month ago I couldn't shake it anymore. I told him \"I'm starting this up again and I really don't care what people have to say about it. I want to do it, I'm doing it.\" He said \"Okay, I support you no matter what\". But then a week or so ago he started talking to me about his business idea and he's like \"yeah so I figured you could manage the whole thing\". I told him I didn't know if I could manage running two operations with a 2yo and he goes \"well I figured you could just put off your thing for a couple years while we see if this works\". I told him I didn't want to put off my thing and he got irritated and said \"this can be OUR thing as a family. House flipping is a washed out market and there's too much risk involved and we would be pushing out too much money and I'm excluded so I think we should just do this instead.\" I told him that HE wouldn't be pushing out any money and I don't hire out so no, he's wrong. And he goes \"you split all profit with your dad, uncle and brother. I want to start something where we aren't paying other people for their part and we can pocket all profit.\" So, I told him he needed to stop trying to control my life because this is the 2nd year he's tried convincing me not to do something that made me successful to begin with, that I LOVE doing.

End of discussion there. Most businesses close within the first year. He doesn't seem to have the skills or knowledge to be able to run or manage a business and it certainly won't be turning a profit immediately. So, where does he think the money to pay the bills will come from?\n\nNTA. Start flipping houses again. You, your Dad, Uncle and Brother know what you are doing and have been doing it profitably for years. That said, look into putting it into some kind of business structured in such a way that you won't lose it in the event of divorce.\n\nLook, PLENTY of people run businesses and have toddlers. You get a sitter so you can work and all will be fine. I wouldn't take a toddler on a construction site for obvious reasons but there is absolutley no reason you can't continue doing what you have been doing for YEARS. \n\nYou were successful and profitable before your husband was ever involved. Quite honestly, he sounds jealous of your success so he is trying to ruin it for you.", "you're the asshole for trying to bring in money? how?\n\nhow about he shuts the f up and goes back to his nonexistent job and lets his dynamite meal ticket do her thing? put some friggin respect on your name and what youve already done.", "NTA. I am a tad sympathetic to your husband because he feels excluded compared to some (frankly imaginary) business venture you'd doing together. But you have a proven track record of success and a network of support -  your dad, uncle and brother - to make your business happen and that is massively valuable compared to an untested new business. In a few years' time, who knows if your family partners will still be doing work like this. \n\nYour work - which brings a lot of the money into your household - does not need to enable or involve him. He isn't precluded from getting a job or having a career due to your decision, yet he's acting like it is. If at some point you want to go into business with him, great, but I don't blame you for not wanting to right now. He sounds kid of untethered professionally and IDK if it will be wise for you to gamble your joint earning potential and household income - putting all your eggs into one basket as they say.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite the controlling AH that you see him as. You readily admit that he wants you to be happy. He was first concerned about you working with a newborn. That\u2019s not totally out of line. He also brought it an idea that would allow you two to make money without paying part of the profits to others. Also not an AH suggestion. \n\nIt seems like you thoroughly enjoy flipping houses and should pursue that. It also seems that he doesn\u2019t quite appreciate how much you enjoy it. But his concerns/suggestions don\u2019t make him the AH in my view, nor particularly controlling. NAH", "I mean he\u2019s not trying to control your life. Thats an overstatement.\n\nHe wants to create a system where you two get all the money and in-laws aren\u2019t getting a chunk of it. \n\nI think this whole thing was blown out of proportion, largely because you jumped to accusing him of controlling your life.\n\nNAH, but I think you guys should consider getting normal jobs for a bit until your child gets a bit older and you have more time to do \u201cside\u201d work", "Yeah, he\u2019s disregarding your opinions, experience, and incredible success and trying to stuff you into his current idea. It does seem odd that he went from \u201ctough to do that with baby\u201d to \u201cyou can run my entire operation\u201d within a week. Based on the information in your post: NTA", "NTA you are entitled to your own career and your own passions. If your husband wants to pursue something he is welcome to but he doesn't get to force you to put your career on hold to support him in his.", "He's planning an imaginary business that OP should do the actual work for so he can feel he makes money!", "At first I almost felt a little bad for him too, but she tried to get him involved and he quit.  That's fine, it's not for everyone, but don't belittle her for continuing to do it.  He's got issues.", "I'd agree with you if he wasn't persistently trying to get her to stop working with her family.  He's doing his best to be subtle about it.  The common thread in everything he's done or said.\n\nYou may not see it because you're probably an awesome guy who truly cares about his wife's happiness.  This guy isn't and is smart enough to hide his true intentions.  I think he's good at manipulation.", "It's weird for sure.  I almost wonder if he feels intimidated or jealous because her male family members take part in the flipping.", "I don\u2019t have enough fingers to count the number of unwarranted assumptions you just made."]}
