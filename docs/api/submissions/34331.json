Does she want you speaking for her?", "YTA\n\nmy dad had a fight with his sister a few years ago, just between the two of them. For some reason her daughter felt the need to jump in and sent my dad nasty messages \u201cdefending\u201d her mom. You, like my cousin, need to learn to butt out of other peoples business. Who are you to insert yourself in sibling drama that has *nothing* to do with you?? \n\nAlso, if your mom is now living with her I can assume they\u2019ve forgiven each other or at least moved past the initial fight so why in the ever living fuck did you *go to your aunts house to confront her about a fight from two years ago that you weren\u2019t even part of??* YOU are the drama here.\n\nStay in your lane and let them figure it out amongst themselves. It\u2019s ridiculous for you to be so hell bent on inserting yourself in a fight between siblings and you look very childish and immature doing so.", "YTA\n\nIt's been 2 years. It's their business, they dealt with it. Your aunt is letting your mother stay there. \n\nStay out of it and do not add more to your mom's plate who is already dealing with so much.", "YTA. You inserted yourself into a sibling squabble. That's on you.", "ESH, I know you wanted to right by your mother, but sadly she seems ok with it. I think you should take a step back and let your mother handle her own relationships. You don\u2019t have to be nice to your aunt though, she sounds vile and cruel. I\u2019d just stay away from her.", "ESH\n\nYour mother's relationship with her sister is not something you can control. I get why you put your foot into it, I even respect your choice, but it was your choice.", "YTA - you went out of your way to try and intimidate your aunt, that backfired, maybe next time you\u2019ll try not to bully people.", "I would assume your mom has forgiven her since they\u2019re staying with her and if this is her brother they\u2019re under a lot of stress with his diagnosis and invasive and disfiguring surgeries. Either leave it in the past or stay away from your aunt\u2019s house unless you\u2019re ready to apologize. They don\u2019t need this petty shit right now.

Mind your business, there were clearly more important things going on.", "How old are you? You have no manners. That was over two years ago. You stayed at her house and have the nerve to bring back old incident. It's good that you defend your mom at THAT moment. What you are doing now is just petty.\n\nYTA for bringing up the argument.  Just let it go kid. Cut your aunt out of your life, she sound nasty. But I'm guessing you enjoyed the drama", "YTA. If your mother reconciled with her after the incident then you were just stoking an old fire. Considering that you were a guest in their home you could have just left or not shown up in the first place.", "YTA. Stay out of other people's business.", "NTA. Aunt sounds like a real piece of work. Confronting her might have been necessary but she didn't have to treat you like crap afterwards.", "NTA \n\nYour aunt sounds like a nightmare. Just because your parents were forced to rely on her it doesn't make her a decent person. Her over the top response to you calling her out at home just proves that someone needs to call her on her shite.\n\nShe's clearly out of control.\n\n**EDIT:** And don't feel bad about calling her out in front of her husband. Based on the behavior you have described, on her part, her husband is WELL AWARE.", "NTA for standing up for your loved ones and addressing disrespectful behavior is a reasonable response. However, the key is how you handle such confrontations. It's been years ago and I'm sure she probably learned her lesson so going there to confront her might have been overboard. It's important to approach these conversations with respect and a desire for understanding.", "ESH.  You stuck your nose in there it didn\u2019t belong and made a bad situation worse.

Your mom also sucks for telling you about it in the first place. Your mom is an adult and has to fight her own battles. It's up to your mother to set her boundaries with her sister.", "My mom told me about it and was pretty upset, so my first instinct was to confront her over Facebook. After hearing my mom would be living with her, I was afraid she might do it again and I felt like I should say something. My mom doesn't know.", "> That was over two years ago.\n\nUnless she's apologized for calling OP's mom pathetic, I don't care how long ago it was. That sort of behavior is unacceptable. The aunt's behavior towards OP since then only further demonstrates that someone needs to put her in her place.", "There was never a reconciliation", "Amen!", "Again, does your mom lack the agency to speak up for herself and does she want you speaking for her?\n\nDid you make sure that after two years your mom was still upset about it, especially since she decided to stay with your aunt?\n\nDid you ask your mom if she was over it?", "She never apologized, that is a great point.", "So they lived together disrespecting each other? Yikes.", "My mom can speak for herself, but she doesn't know I confronted my aunt at all. I don't know if she wanted me to speak to my aunt about it, but there has been a history of them fighting, even physically, in the past.", "That's what they're getting at. You took it upon yourself to insert yourself into a situation between your mother and your aunt. Your mother was venting to you, and you used that to overstep. In doing so, you actually make your mother look incapable of standing up for herself. That she needs you to fight her battles for her. The main complaint you made is that your aunt called her pathetic, but what you did will give that very impression. So for that, YTA. You should have remained on the sideline unless it was completely necessary to intervene."]}
