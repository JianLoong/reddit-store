It sounds a bit creepy to me.", "NTA Your uncle sounds like a total creep who is deeply insecure and resentful that women can be successful. You should make it clear to everyone that he has been hounding you and has a weird obsession with you, and that he is not to talk to you again. He\u2019s been annoying you purposefully for ages to make you crack and seem like the bad guy, when it\u2019s really him.", "NTA, op. Apart from your uncles childish behaviour I hope you had a lovely Christmas day. With family like that who needs enemies? Imo intelligence isn't always necessarily academic so don't let his comments get to you. Hope you enjoy the rest of the holidays \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf84", "Uncle or not, someone pokes my thigh , they're going to get at the least a verbal take down. NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  And call him out if he ever touches your thigh again.  Do it publicly.  \"Get your hand off my leg, you perve.\"", "NTA. That's the only kind of response people like him understand", "NTA, you were completely in the right. Your uncle is deeply insecure, and the rest of the family should have known better and stopped this for you. If you were my family I'd support you 100%. \n\nBut I think the language can use work. There's gonna be a lot of people who are going to piss you off, you want to come out of an argument looking like the clear winner. For example, you might want to calmly turn the situation back to the attacker and put him on the spot.\n\n\"Why are you so obsessed with taunting me about these games you find online? What's it to you if I get it right/wrong?\"\n\nWhatever his response is, ask him \"Why?\" so he'll be forced to defend himself. \n\nHim: \"I just want to see if your education/school is worth anything.\" - - - You: \"Why? What's it to you?\" \n\nHim: \"I thought it was funny. It's just a joke\" You: \"Why is it funny?\"\n\nHim: \"Well, if you're afraid to play...\" You: No, I'm not afraid but I'd like to know why you always get a kick out of doing this to me? So why?\"\n\nTurn it back to him. Sorry you even have to deal with an AH.", "ESH. He is obviously insecure and you're obviously rude. I find it weird that people think they can go into another's home and make a celebration awkward for everyone because someone is annoying yet don't see their behavior as unacceptable too. Maybe he needed to be put in his place but this wasn't just about you.", "NTA, but you could have said the same thing without the F-bomb. You let him have the moral high ground. He needles you to get a reaction like that and you gave it to him.\n\nWhen he interrupts you, just say, \"Evidently the school you attended did teach you to interrupt women when they're talking.\"\n\nMy petty side would suggest you bring your own logic games for him, but that's too much work -- much more than he deserves.\n\nAnother thing to say is, \"Look, I know that educated women threaten you, but could you try and just live with it until we get through the holiday.\"\n\nGood luck with this.", "I'd love to know Uncle's background. Does he pick on any other women in the family? Has he finished high school?", "> Why is your mom tolerating this?\n\nThis is absolute bullshit. Your family should be protecting you. I have an uncle who used to engage in a MUCH milder form of this game. Like when I graduated from a good college with various honors he was like, \u201ccan\u2019t wipe your ass with college diploma these days!\u201d\n\nAnd my mom was like, \u201cChuck, I believe the word you\u2019re looking for is \u2018congratulations!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnyway, leave you the fuck alone is the right answer. You can also point out that the opportunity to go to college as a mature student remains. If he feels he missed out, he should seize the day. If he actually thinks college is dumb he should STFU and be glad he never made that mistake.", "How about just, \u201cuncle, no one\u2019s accusing you of being dumb. You are very intelligent in your own way. You don\u2019t need to go to college to be smart.\u201d \n\nMight neutralize him. Good luck.", "Yes! OP is a 20 year old woman, and her uncle by marriage negs her and demands attention and pokes her in the thigh at the table? What a creep. OP's parents need to shut this down, because ignoring it isn't working", "> However, it is possible to dismiss this behavior more politely before resorting to such drastic language.\n\nYou mean exactly what OP has been doing for several years?", "And therein lies the problem.  They refuse to rock the boat.   They let this keep happening.  Everyone there let\u2019s him get away with it.   No one says anything and when OP finally stops him they become the bad guys.  It\u2019s a messed up family dynamic.   The entire family needs to be recalibrated to call out shitty behavior for what it is.  Immediately.  (Which can be done kindly.)", "You should have a sit down with your parents. No one should be touching you without your consent. Your thighs? No. Your parents need to stand up for you because letting their daughter get bullied by an adult man is not okay for anyone.", "makes sense that he's a prison guard", "Nah OP was succinct. \"Your little games are stupid, leave me the fuck alone.\" Volunteering to take an SAT test with Uncle, would just buy into his bullshit that it's some competition pfft\n\nThat asshole/his enabling mother would have shouted op down 2.5 sentences into your three paragraph monologue.", "The first one was great, >I find your personality tedious and grating. But the SAT thing won't work as he doesn't value that as a metric. He doesn't value education of any kind, especially standardized tests that lend themselves to institutionalized education like college. I think that telling him his personality is tedious and grating would be enough to ward him off. I would also find the person who is kind of the Ring Leader of the family and talk to them. See if they can help set some boundaries. Also him poking OP on the thigh is really weird and uncomfortable and I would tell another safe person in the family about that.\n\nOP isn't the AH here though and I hope that this stops for them. I know how this goes. My family did this to me and I hate seeing poor boundaries like this.\n\nEDIT: spelling error", "\u201cOp should\u2019ve thought of a well thought complete response and delivered a short essay in a matter of seconds\u201d", "This is The Way.", "Ooh, totally savage!
