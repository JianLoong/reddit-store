She has 2 sons and a daughter, I have a daughter as well. We decided to bring the kids to the park and out for a picnic yesterday. I also brought my dog (retriever mix). This is the first time I've brought my dog on one of our dates. \n\nWhen the kids got hungry I set up a blanket and brought out the food and we all start eating. My dog is food driven in a sense of if she knows someone has food she will excessively sniff the air/ground while pacing. She won't get too close (at most 5 feet away), as she knows better, but she will look at you the whole time she's doing it. Or she will \"stretch\" forward and sniff the air closer to you but backs off again if she knows she's gotten too close. We had BLTs and I should have known better because the only time my dog whines while sniffing around is if she smells bacon. So that was my bad but again, she wasn't getting too close because she knows better. It truly set my date off though.\n\nLike.. she would look at my dog every time she would whine or sniff the air around us and then look back at me with a \"seriously?\" expression. I asked what was wrong and she says \"I mean.. it kind of makes for a bit of a distracting and unpleasant experience for a dog to be whining and scrounging for food while we are eating, don't you think?\" To which I replied with \"I don't think so. She knows not to get too close.\" She kind of shakes her head and continues eating. Maybe 3 minutes later my dog sat dog and just stared at my sandwich and did a bit of a whimper and at this point my date wrapped up her and her kids food and moved away from us (me, my kid, my dog) and went to the picnic table (we didn't go there originally because it was kinda dirty and had ants). After the kids went back to playing I approached her and said that her reaction was a bit dramatic. That if she just ignored the dog she would have seen that the dog wasn't doing anything wrong. She told me that my failure to train my dog not to be food driven and her becoming frustrated with it is not her being dramatic. She said she would hold off on future dates because this is a deal breaker for her. AITA?\n\nETA: she has 4 dogs and all of her dogs have been trained to stay far away from people when they are eating. Very well behaved dogs. However, I don't see a problem with my dog doing what she did. It boils down to a difference of opinion I guess.", "created_utc": 1681490555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m3a8m/aita_for_calling_my_date_overdramatic/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's pretty annoying to eat with a dog after your food. And for you to then call your date 'overdramatic' because she had to move her and her kids away from said dog definitely sends it into asshole territory.\n\nI guess its all data for the two of you as you figure out the relationship. You might want to be with somebody who loves dogs more. She might want to be with somebody who doesn't do this sort of thing on a date. To each their own!", "YTA. \nYou taught your dog it is okay to beg/whimper for food, and it is reasonable to find that behavior annoying.\nInstead of being mad at the dog, she was sensible and voiced her disapproval to the one that was responsible for the behavior, and you shot back at her for that (again, reasonable) criticism.", "YTA  Not everyone thinks your dog is just the best.  You might try to be more atune to those around you.  She wasn't being dramatic she was expressing dislike of the situation.  Completely reasonable.  I would have packed up & gone home in her place.", "YTA - the issue isn't the dog but how you dismissed your date's boundaries for her and her children by calling her overdramatic. She removed herself from a situation she didn't like, and you decided she was overreacting. She didn't make a scene or call you out in front of the kids. She just moved away from the dog since you weren't stopping the dog from begging. \n\nAre you aware of how loaded words like \"over dramatic\" are when used toward women's feelings? They are used to shame women into compliance and, for generations, kept us in a lesser than category. Not that long ago, women could be institutionalized against their will if their husband's thought they were \"over dramatic\" or \"hysterical.\" I'm not saying this was your intent, but you should understand how grown women feel when certain words are used towards them when a man doesn't like what they are doing (see also: bossy). You did, however, invalidate her feelings and she is making the right choice in stepping back.", "YTA\n\nDramatic? All she did was fix a situation that shouldn't have happened at all. \n\nYou were overdramatic calling her dramatic. To want to be able to eat without an animal physically and verbally begging for your food is a reasonable thing to want. It was very rude to expect her to be okay with that and act like she's the unreasonable one. \n\nJust because you're able to tune out that whining and begging doesn't make it reasonable to expect her and the kids to tune it out too.", "Your edit just makes you look even worse.  Hint:  if you  ever have to write \u201cagain, my bad\u201d in your side of the story, then you\u2019re probably the AH. And you most certainly are in this case.  \n\nNo one wants to have a dog whining and remonstrating for food the entire time. \n\nEither train your dog better or leave her at home next time.  Apologize to everyone and treat them to a nice lunch somewhere.\n\nYTA.", "YTA for not train your dog properly and for calling her dramatic, which she wasnt", "YTA.   No one wants a begging dog while trying to enjoy their food.\n\n\nYOU might think it's okay but your date doesn't.", "YTA\n\nThink if the dog was a person, pacing, sniffing around your picnic, and making \u201cmmm, smells great!\u201d remarks. Annoying, right? You\u2019d likely tell that person, even if they\u2019re keeping a five foot distance, to go away. Your dog is poorly trained. Just because it keeps its distance doesn\u2019t mean the behavior isn\u2019t begging. It should sit or lay on command, and not be staring bullets into everyone who has a sandwich.", "I LOVE DOGS\u2026.\n\nBut I do NOT love it when my dogs or anyone else\u2019s dogs come begging in my face while I\u2019m eating. \nMy dogs learn from puppyhood that this is a big no-no!\n\nOP you\u2019re in the wrong here.\nYTA for sure.", "YTA You have too low standards for training your dog.", "YTA. You shouldn't have brought the dog in the first place, and a whining/begging dog is annoying af", "YTA. \n\nVery few people are comfortable eating with a dog constantly begging.", "YTA. No one likes it when the dog sits and stares at them while eating. Just because she didn't get 'too close' doesn't make people comfortable with it. Your date was clearly uncomfortable with this and the begging and decided to move to the table. If it's a deal breaker, then it's's time to move on.", "YTA.  Your date gave you a boundary towards your dog and you completely ignored it.  It was your job to attend to your dog's behavior not your date's responsibility to ignore the dog.  It's true that peoples tolerances differ, but your date's is not as big as yours and she did the responsible thing and moved a way.  I am a dog  person and wouldn't stand for my dog to do what yours did and if my dog did then put it in a sit, take it for a walk while everyone else eats or do whatever is different to change the dogs behaviors and you did none of it.", "YTA. You trained your dog to beg.  While it is not physically taking food out of people\u2019s hands, it IS still begging, and yes, most people are annoyed by that. Calling your date dramatic because she doesn\u2019t want to eat around a dog that cries when it doesn\u2019t get bacon is asshole behavior. Additionally, in multi-dog households, begging can be a safety concern. Dogs can get along wonderfully until there is food around. It\u2019s not unusual or unnatural for dogs to guard food. If you were ever to integrate households with another dog-owner, you\u2019re increasing the potential for dog-to-dog conflict.", "Everyone saying YTA to this guy\u2026 obviously ya\u2019ll don\u2019t have pets. \n\nNTA dude, ditch the girl, keep the dog lol She has zero patience and sounds like this was an insight to a drama filled relationship.", "YTA. What your dog was doing wasn't that bad. You have trained it, so it knows not to come close. So that part was fine. You might have warned her before bringing the dog how it would behave. But not doing so didn't make you TA. The part that makes me consider you TA is your dismissing her feelings as overly dramatic. It's understandable that someone might be bothered by a meal interrupted by a whining, begging dog. You should have discussed your different expectations of pets without resorting to calling her overly dramatic.", "YTA for calling her over-dramatic for not liking the behavior of your dog.  Your edit even made it worse as she knows how to train a dog NOT to do what your actually did.\n\nIt may have been too early in your dating to introduce your dog, especially if you were going to be having food and you know your dog behaves like this.  What are you going to do when you have someone over at your house for dinner or breakfast and the dog does this?  Call them overdramatic when the dog is whining and being a nuisance?  \n\nAnd that you do not see anything wrong with it is just as bad.  It's not cute, it's annoying to many people. Train your dog.", "NAH, but maybe not enough compatibility either.", "I was leaning n ta, but specifically YTA for calling her dramatic.\n\nYou two don't sound compatible, and thats OK, but just because she has different ideas on appropriate behavior for a dog around food doesn't make her wrong. She also isn't familiar with your dog.", "YTA. Train your dog.", "Nta, it\u2019s bacon! Consider yourself lucky she excused herself from the relationship. That is dramatic and just plain dumb.", "NAH\n\nThe dog isn\u2019t violating any major rules. Not every dog can behave 100% how individually expected. They have characters too. However if it\u2019s a deal breaker for her you could try to find out how to compromise if you make some amends. Maybe going to a dog school if the dog isn\u2019t too old.", "NTA just like some people discipline and raise their kids differently, so do dog owners. It doesn't sound like your dog was being all that annoying. He let you know he'd like food, but kept his distance. Not sure why this is a deal-breaker for her.", "NTA\n\nIt is unreasonable of her to expect that every other dog on the planet be just like hers. Her physically moving herself and her children was for sure dramatic. Wow.", "Big fat NTA. Like at all.\nEvery dog is different and your dog didn't even come close so what's the issue? I would have found it funny.\nShe probably also trains her dogs to clean up their own shit lmao.", "NTA. You\u2019ve trained your dog to be better about people eating than like 90% of dogs. Have people ITT even met a dog? Do you know what a dog is?", "So many YTA. Wow. I would have given the dog a piece of my bacon and continued talking.", "YTA she summed it up pretty well your poorly trained dog was annoying so she moved.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrain your dog better.", "The only different to her is that it was your dog and not hers.\n\nNTA", "YTA train your damn dog", "If you hadn\u2019t called her dramatic, I\u2019d say NAH. You simply have different feelings and tolerance levels about this issue. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re morally or logically wrong, just incompatible. That said, you don\u2019t get to tell someone else they\u2019re being dramatic for being different from you. She isn\u2019t. If it\u2019s an issue for her, then she\u2019s right that you aren\u2019t compatible. If her taking issue with it is an issue for you, isn\u2019t that just another sign pointing to the end of your dates together?\n\nYTA, but not a big one imo. You definitely could have avoided being one by simply accepting her feelings about the issue.", "ESH just sounds like a bad fit", "NTA. sounds like you love your dog and do well by them. on the other hand you might have to find a new romantic interest\u2026", "A bit of ESH. She was being dramatic about it, and her impatience is a red flag. But you could have handled it better instead of totally dismissing her feelings - when she said she found something unpleasant your response was \"I don't think so\". You didn't even hear her.\n\nIn a functional situation, you would have asked her for her advice/expertise how she trained her dogs so well so that you could do the same thing...and/or she would have offered help and/or advice with the problem. The fact that such a small thing was inflated into a deal-breaker type conflict is a bad sign.", "NTA That is a good dog and a bad date.", "I hate it when my dogs do this so much i make them go outside while I'm eating so i get it.  YTA", "[deleted]", "Well then I have to concede. She was just not loving the begging! I\u2019m a sucker for dogs \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. Maybe some more training for your dog lol!", "YTA - Whining, begging dogs are really annoying to people who don't worship the ground that dogs walk on. Enabling your dog's bad habits is a reflection of you being a sub-par dog owner and that's something she obviously does not respect. She tried to approach you about it and you labeled her overdramatic. You, sir, are a winner at dismissing people's feelings and discomfort.\n\nGood for her for seeing that and taking quick action so things don't become more serious between you two, because there is clearly an incompatibility.", "YTA", "YTA.\nYour dog begs and whines for food. That's poor behavior", "To be honest I don\u2019t think anyone is TA in this situation, but if she got this upset over the dog idk if it\u2019s a good fit? I\u2019m impressed with how well she has trained her dogs but she can\u2019t expect everyone else\u2019s dogs to be absolutely perfect all the time. It\u2019s bacon \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I mean I\u2019d honestly laugh about it and if she is upset maybe just don\u2019t dine with the dog around.", "I just think this is a compatibility issue. My dog lays at our feet when we eat and sometimes watches me cook from the kitchen doorway (he\u2019s not allowed in the kitchen because I drop food and knives constantly and don\u2019t want to kill him) but my SO and I don\u2019t care about a dog staring at us. Some people become infuriated by it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but I wouldn\u2019t be living with someone like that. I don\u2019t think you needed to call her dramatic though. You guys just have different opinions and boundaries.\n\nAn ex of mine had a brother who would scream at his dog for looking at him even from across the room while he ate. Now THATS overdramatic imo", " That is dramatic and just plain dumb.", "How is op the ah?  Op did train her dog to not come close which is more than the majority of dog owners out there. I understand the situation is not ideal however this is an animal and will act accordingly and there is no reason for sick drastic behaviour.

Have these people ever met a dog???

It is not normal dog behavior to whine and beg for food. That is an untrained dog. He clearly did not take the time to teach his dog that this behavior is not okay. \n\nAnd she has four dogs, all well behaved.

To me this is a poorly trained dog & I would not want to be around it.", "She loves dogs. She has 4 of them. But admittedly none of her dogs will even step foot in to an area where they know someone is eating. Not sure how she trained them to do that but her dogs are incredibly well behaved. I think it just boils down to a difference in opinion. I don't feel my dog is doing anything wrong but she does and has trained her dogs specifically not to do that.", "Moving to a place where a dog isn\u2019t whining and begging for food is sick, drastic behavior?

She is completely right that is it annoying and unpleasant and she is well within her rights to move to avoid his dogs untrained behavior.", "I agree most dogs are ridiculously untrained.  Doesn't mean this one is trained acceptably just cause he isn't as bad as some.", "Wow moving away is \"sick, drastic behaviour\"? WTF have you been smoking, mate :D", "Especially since she is, by his own admission, better at training dogs.", "It's even worse that he's teaching his daughter her boundaries don't need to be respected by others. Kids watch and learn.", "Yup same. I even read one comment telling him how it was wrong of him to use the word dramatic because women have had a bad history with it.\nI as a women think she was being overly dramatic too. It's giving me \"Ugh they need to remove these homeless people they stink\" kinda vibes.\nIt would have been a completely different situation if his dog would have actually tried to take the food but he didn't. He was just whining a bit jeez.", "it wasnt like the dog was snarling at them or stealing food. A little whine from an animal isnt that bad so i agree with op that she was overreacting", "All responsible pet owners should train their dogs not to do that. It's bad animal behavior.

YTA", "YTA any dog I\u2019ve ever had does not beg for food and knows to stay away when eating sure during training they make mistakes but after that they\u2019re good.

This is not good/acceptable behavior form the dog.", "i do work in vet med. imo, if a dog is not causing harm to others or itself, then i dont see an issue.", "Well, that's one perspective.  I would not want to have to associate with your pets.  I prefer those that a fully trained, not just the ones who aren't going to hurt me.
