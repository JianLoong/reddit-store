It\u2019s a court order. You have to follow it.", "Grandparents can pay for extracurriculars.  Problem solved.", "Life isn't fair. The sooner kids learn this and accept it the healthier they will be. If you want proof look around at all the unhappy adults.", "NTA his family can pay for the activities if they care that much. What your ex pays for is none of your business unless it endangers your kids. Tell hubby to grow a spine and get off your ass. If he wants them in these activities, he can get a 2nd job and have his parents help pay for it", "Have you considered paying for at least one extra curricular each for your step kids? If it\u2019s split between you, your husband and their mother it probably wouldn\u2019t be too expensive. If this is such an issue I\u2019d make it a priority.

I get that you can\u2019t afford the extracurriculars for your step kids but you really do need to find something to \u201ceven the playing field\u201d or your ILs are correct that you will set up a very bad dynamic where your step kids will see favoritism and be hurt", "NTA\n\nYour divorce and custody agreement with your Ex specifies that your bio-kids get to do extras and their father lays for them.  \n\nTell your in laws that you are so glad they have agreed to cover the costs of their own grandchildren joining in on those extras.  \n\nMeanwhile, can the step kids do some chores for people nearby (raking leaves, shoveling snow, washing windows, etc), maybe some neighbors?  That would help cover the costs Of the activities they want to do.\n\nAre there scholarships available for the activities?  With 3 additional children, bringing the total to five in the family, can you qualify for financial assistance?", "If you offered the low/no-cost option and the step-kids declined because they are lame... then they aren't interested in extracurricular activities -- they're more interested in the money or maybe the time/preparation/equipment their step-sibs receive. Try to equalize that more.\n\nIs there a way to tighten the budget so that a medium-cost activity for the oldest could be achieved? Do they actually have any passionate interests to encourage? Are there any after-school activities that they absolutely insist on attending? Check the local library or MeetUp for offerings. Start giving them reasonable payment for chores they do around the house.  If they save up, then you know they have an interest... for budgeting if nothing else.\n\nAnd, of course, if their relatives comment negatively... then thank them for their interest and insist they pay.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Sounds like your IL should pay for the stepkids' activities.  Win-Win.", "NTA and I'm so glad this has been solved because your in laws will be paying for their grandkids extra circulars.

And if they get pissy because you don't get to decide how they spend their money, point out that, by the same token, they don't get to decide how your ex spends his money \u2013 so, just as you don't get to demand that they pay for it, neither do they get to demand that your ex pay for it.", "Agree and op should tell the in laws to pay for said activities since they want the stepkids to participate. NTA", "And it\u2019s a totally reasonable thing for grandparents to pay for! It\u2019s extremely common for grandparents to be the ones funding soccer or summer camp or ski club.
