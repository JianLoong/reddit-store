She had 6 years to figure out how to at least repair enough damage that her kids wouldn't go no contact the moment they were able. Sounds like the opposite happened. NTA", "NTA. ....but your sister is. \n\nI don't know what is with people pushing family members to reconcile simply because they are blood related, but it's something that needs to stop. People are allowed to choose who they want in their lives, and just because someone helped create you doesn't mean you have to choose them.", "NTA. Your kids made the decision on their own about their relationship with her and you didn\u2019t force them. Your ex chose to have an affair. Your son is an adult and gets to choose who cones to his wedding.", "Definitely NTA, your ex fucked around LITERALLY and found out.  She alienated them, not you and she's paying the price.", "NTA. It seemed like you did your best to encourage them to have some contact with their mother. But they are adult now and can decide whether they want to or not and they clearly decided.", "NTA. You respected your son's wishes as to who he wants at your wedding. You rightly refused to try to run an end-around the guest list.", "NTA. It sounds like the kids have thought this through. Your ex paid a very high price for her choices.", "Nta, life isn't fair, and you and/or your sister can not and should not change your kids' minds. \n\nIf your sister wants to take your ex-wife to the wedding as her plus one,  she can do that.  It's not her place to force you to do it. \n\nThe bottom line is tho that your son does not want your ex-wife at his wedding, and no one should help her to get into a wedding when the groom does not want her there.", "NTA. You are leaving the decision to the kids who are now grown. It is not your problem anymore. The mother should have thought about all of this before cheating. You did everything right and I commend you for it.", "NTA.  Sounds like three people are sensible.", "NTA. First, you seem like an amazing father handling this all so well. It seems like your kids are both mature adults who can make there own decisions.\n\nI'll take this a step further, YWBTA if you took your ex to the wedding when it is clear your son does not want her there.", "NTA. I can't imagine how hard it was for your kids to have to spend 1 week a month with their mom and her AP. It does you and them credit that you talked to them and they listened and got through it, though. They've made their decision and you made it clear they didn't have to do it for your sake. This is their decision, they're adults now and that's that.", "NTA. She had plenty of time to try family therapy and make amends to her children for her actions, and it doesn't sound like she did enough for them.\n\nIt sucks for her, but she got caught cheating, and this is what happens.  Sometimes, the kids \"choose sides\" as it were.", "NTA. You did your best while raising them it seems, and if they decided to cut contact then that is 100% their decision.", "Your sister is being empathetic, and putting herself in your ex's shoes - your ex is no doubt heartbroken, but it is as a result of her own actions, that broke 3 more (far more vulnerable) hearts.  Your sister should extend your son the same empathic courtesy. Ask her to imagine that if she was saying her marriage vows, would she want the home wrecker who wrecked *her home, specifically* there - her biggest, most personal example of how to destroy a marriage. Also, anyone who thinks your kids feelings are extreme should not forget - *the kids discovered her infidelity first, and were forced into a traumatic position of either betraying you, or ending their own family unit*. Yea easy NTA for you and your son. F your ex wife.", "NTA. I\u2019d guess there are other toxic things about her behavior that essentially repulse them for them to both go NC. In any case, it\u2019s their right as autonomous human beings. You did everything you should\u2019ve done to make them aware they didn\u2019t need to do anything for your sake. You\u2019d be really setting everyone up for some drama if you for any reason caved to your ex\u2019s demands\u2026that WOULD make you TA. It\u2019s your son\u2019s choice who he invites to HIS wedding, as you explained.", "NTA. Your son's wedding, therefore he gets to say who may come. It's an occasion you want to share with the people you hold dear in your life. Sucks for ex-wife but if she doesnt get the cut, then she doesnt get the cut.\n\nStill less traumatizing than seeing your mother who was still on an existing marriage get it on with another man at such a young age too", "NTA. All the damage was caused by her, and it looks like she never tried to change what happened. To redeem herself. She can get the no contact and be happy with it.", "NTA. It seems to me that she maybe didn\u2019t make them a priority when they were with her. She probably was more fixated on her boyfriend then her children if she never realized something was wrong and they decided to go no contact. I like that you don\u2019t bad mouth her and actually have an adult conversation with them.", "NTA. \n\nI'm not sure what convoluted logic your sister is using to get to the decision that your son isn't mature enough to decide if he does or doesn't want someone in his life. Or how exactly you're supposed to \"make\" him do something he's decided not to do. He's 22, an adult,  starting his own family, and his decision to go no contact sounds like it was a long time coming. \n\nMake no mistake - had your said yes to your ex that would have been a huge AH move. You did the right thing.", "NTA.\nI don't believe you turned your children against your ex, they are the ones who discovered the infidelity, and it sounds like theu were both old enough to understand what she did.  You did your best to keep the peace through the years of shared custody.\nYour son, while young, is an adult, and has every right to decide who to associate with and who to invite to his wedding.  Bringing her would be a slap in his face, and would very likely endanger your relationship with both of your children.\nTell her that her relationship with the children is not your problem to fix. I'd suggest to her that seeing a therapist might be a good idea, to talk with someone objective, and see where things went wrong.  (She won't, she will, by the sound of things, lose her mind, but you will know you tried.)", "NTA - I can't say it loud or strongly enough - NTA!!!\n\nYou hit the nail on the head, that they are, for all intents and purposes, adults, and can make their own decisions and choices. If your son wanted his mother at his wedding, he would have invited her - period. And from what it sounds like, that's what he told you. \n\nBesides, think about what would happen if you did take her. You are then putting your son in a situation of having someone at his wedding that he didn't want there, plus I'm fairly confident in saying that his mother would  likely take the opportunity to guilt trip, complain, wine, moan, etc about his he didn't invite her. Nothing good can come of it.", "NTA\n\nIt obviously sucks for her that she has lost her family but she cheated so I'm not sure what she expected. You are absolutely right that you shouldn't take her as a plus one if the son specifically did not invite her.\n\nIt would be nice if the kids could maybe let her be part of their lives but if family was so important maybe she could have been faithful or tried to be a better to them after the fact. The only way you'd be an asshole here if you did in fact do something to turn them away from her but you'd know if you did that or not.", "NTA\n\nYour son doesn\u2019t want her there. It is his day and you would be an A H if you brought her.", "NTA. Your son is an adult and has made the choice to not invite his mom to his wedding. By not taking her or forcing him to invite her, you are simply respecting his wishes", "NTA Your son is an adult now.", "NTA the kids need therapy, obviously, but it's his wedding and you'd risk ruining your relationship with both children if you actually did take her, not to mention the absolute hole this would create for your ex wife if she ever wants to rekindle a relationship with her child. If she wants to be in her child's life she needs to start respecting their decisions and their boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact your kids immediately moved back in with you and started living with you full time the moment they turned 18 shows how much their mother's actions affected them.\n\nIf you was to take your ex with you as your plus one to the wedding you would be TA because that is disrespecting your son's decision in not inviting her. At the end of the day it's his wedding\n\n>I was telling my sister what happened and to my surprised she said my son wasn\u2019t being fair and I should make him invite his mother to the wedding\n\nFairness is irrelevant since this wedding is your son's. Your sister's suggestion of making him invite his mother to the wedding is a sure fire way to cause your son to go no contact with you as well. I highly suggest you don\u2019t take her advice", "NTA. You have no obligation for your ex to be your plus one, if anything that may even make the situation worse. \nYour children are adults, your son did not invite her, that's it. Now, you can have discussions with him to invite her but it's a fine line between that and badgering.", "NTA\n\n...and stay out of it.  If she ends up being invited, don't be the one to take her.  He didn't invite her for one simple reason.  He doesn't want her there.\n\n.", "NTA, this is between your son and his mother.  The worst possible outcome would be for you to surprise him by bringing her as your plus-one.", "You\u2019ve done well in your co-parenting. More than some people would in considering an ex cheating spouse\u2019s feelings, talking to your children about her. That\u2019s all totally on her. And she got caught by her kids? Whew, NTA.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t force your son not to invite his mother. She cheated and broke up the marriage. You should not have to take her as your date especially when she has a live-in boyfriend.  It\u2019s inappropriate. Your son is a grown man and has the right to invite whoever he wants to his wedding. It is the respectful thing to do to invite both of your parents, however he must have his reasons for not inviting her.", "Your ex fncked around and (got) found out, now she's reaping what she sowed - she has no one but herself to blame. Also, your children are plenty old enough to decide for themselves, so respect their wishes. Carry on as you have and stay away from the ex. **NTA**", "NTA\n\nYour ex-wife had plenty of time to build a relationship post-separation but failed dismally.\n\nIt would be a stark betrayal of your son's wishes to invite her when he had explicitly excluded her. Weddings are stressful and hectic enough without adding an uninvited NC parent.", "NTA. I honestly think you handled this as well as one could - you let the kids make their own choices, engaged them in conversation to get a better understanding, and ultimately respected their decision. Your ex had no right to anything beyond asking, and her threats after being told no demonstrate how your son made the right choice. If she went I suspect there would have been drama.", "NTA.", "Your daughter was 12 when she caught them. I am sure that was a very traumatic event for her. What did your ex wife expect was going to happen? It sounds like she still has no remorse for what she did.", "NTA, your son is getting married, he is a full grown adult and he has made the decision not to invite his mother, that is his adult choice, respect that.", "NTA, your son doesn't want her there. Obviously there's a reason she didn't get an invite, it wasn't an oversight.", "NTA", "NTA. Your kids knew about the cheating and made their own judgements. I chose not to tell my kids about their dad cheating because I know they\u2019d never speak to him again. I\u2019ll tell them if they ask once both are 18. You have done your best to keep a relationship between the kids and their mom. Idk what more she could ask for. I\u2019m honestly amazed they agreed to stick it out as long as they did. \n\nShe needs to appreciate the gift your kids and you gave her of them sticking round as long as they did. I hope my ex one day appreciates me keeping my mouth shut.", "Nta Well well well if it isn\u2019t the consequences of her actions she made her bed let her lie and it honestly I would block her and completely leave her in the past it is what it is let your kids make their own decisions they\u2019re old enough to know what they want better off like this anyways don\u2019t go against your son\u2019s wishes for her she had plenty of time to try to make it up to them and obviously they\u2019re not willing to forgive her it\u2019s their choice maybe one day they are but don\u2019t get in the middle of it cut or completely out She is no longer your problem", "NTA at all. Your son is the only one who gets to decide to have her at the wedding.  Why would you sister even suggest you do that?  Fair or not, your sone specifically doesn\u2019t want her there.  YWBTA if you brought her against his wishes.", "NTA. Good God, the kids found out??? That's traumatizing. Your wife doesn't seem remorseful at all. I wouldn't want to be around her, either.", "NTA but anyone who helps their mother go to that wedding without your sons explicit permission would be a huge one.\n\nYour ex destroyed her relationship with her children with her infidelity and has done no where near enough to fix it.  That's on her.", "Hell no NTA   Being his mom doesn\u2019t equal an automatic invite to the wedding, especially if you\u2019ve been a shitty mom", "NTA your son and daughter are adults, they didn\u2019t haste to cut off their mother. Your ex is delusional if she believes she can force or cheat her way into your grown children life and your sister has no idea of what she\u2019s talking about.", "NTA - Your wife is experiencing what rational people refer to as \"consequences\".  She is responsible for her relationship with her children.  She has had several years to work on regaining ground lost due to the way your marriage ended.  Either she didn't try hard enough or your children simply are not interested.  Neither is your issue.  All you can do by pushing at them on this topic is create damage to your own relationships with them and you don't owe your ex or anyone else that.  I'd suggest you ask your sister how she thinks \"fair\" works in this situation, except that it just doesn't matter--this is your son's wedding and if he doesn't want to invite her, then I guess she won't be there.  Reaping and sowing and all that.", "NTA. As many have said, your son is an adult and can make his own decisions. \n\nI'm a stepfather to two pretty great kids. Their BioDad has pretty much given up on the oldest(19) and is trying to force things with the youngest(14). The custody stuff has been strange but that's another story.\n\nIf either of them told me that they didn't want him at their wedding, not only would I respect that, I would do what I could to help.", "Nta. As OP\u2019s plus one?", "NTA\n\nShe cratered her relationship with her kids. Clearly she wasn\u2019t able to repair it in the last six years. They\u2019re adults and can choose who they want around them. You did the right thing. If you bring her your son will be pissed and you will taint his wedding day. Don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s her department. \n\nI hope she thinks getting some strange dick was worth not being a part of her kids lives.", "Definitely NTA, I don\u2019t blame your kids either. They\u2019re entitled to their own decisions without anyone else meddling.", " NTA it\u2019s not your place to invite her to the wedding. If he wanted her there, she\u2019d have an invite. It\u2019s his choice.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are exactly right, if he didn't invite her himself he obviously doesn't want her there and you shouldn't bring her. Both kids wouldn't have gone no contact without reason, so obviously she burned the bridge herself.\n\nI do have a question though; have you ever asked your kids why they went no contact with her? They both wanted to live with only you early on and then went completely no contact with her as soon as they could, so there must have been some other reason why they didn't want to be near her. All you mentioned was that they essentially suffered through visits after you told them to wait it out till they turned 18, after which they didn't talk about it much, and then you assumed they may have both gone no contact because of your feelings towards their mother. I just feel like you are skimming over the reason your kids hate being around her to this extent, because I would be willing to bet that there was something she did other cheating a half decade ago to earn full NC.", "NTA I'm sure there was some initial resentment about her \"destroying the family\", but it's been 6 years and so I assume there was more than just that to make them go no-contact. (if that's their whole reason, they probably need to go talk to a therapist, but that's a whole separate issue)\n\nNo matter what the reasons though, she wasn't invited. She has to know that her attending would cause a drama and a bunch of attention on her (which could be part of the appeal). If she just wanted to see the wedding, she could have asked if there was a chance it could be streamed or if she could see video or pictures; not the same as being there obviously, but would demonstrate her respecting his wishes while not being completely left out.", "NTA your sister has nothing to do with the dynamics going on in your and your kids lives with the ex. Thank her for her input but tell her you were only venting and was not asking for her opinion on the matter, but now that you see what her thought process is on the matter you will no longer be talking to her anymore about issues with your adult kids and their adulteress mother. \nIt\u2019s not your place also to tell your grown son who to invite to his wedding. Preserve your relationship with your children and stay out of things that\u2019s going on with their mom. Don\u2019t try to intervene on her behalf again she caused this problem and as you said your children are now grown so stay out of it!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Which was probably quite traumatic for a 12ish year old girl to witness her mom\u2019s infidelity and then have to be the one to break it to her dad. Not to mention, that\u2019s a pretty inappropriate way to learn about s** . Your son was a great big brother and support system for her. I\u2019m sure it upset him that his mom put your daughter in that position aside from breaking up your marriage and family.  He\u2019s got every reason to be angry as well. He too had to be the messenger and the bearer of bad news to you and his baby sister about mom\u2019s dirty deeds. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t appreciate having to give his sister any kind of the s** talk. No kid should have to be in the position your kids were in. \n\nPlus, They\u2019ve lived the last six years having to endure their mother and her attitude and behavior. I\u2019m guessing that she tried forcing a relationship with her affair partner on her kids too. And possibly even picked fights with them because of their distance and disgust towards her.  It\u2019s probably not as cut and dried as it seems as it sounds like your kids like to keep you in the dark regarding their mother these days. Probably because they\u2019ve already severely hurt you because of her actions and they don\u2019t ever want to do that again. \n\nAs for the wedding, You did everything correctly by not agreeing to take your ex wife as your plus one. You definitely should not be disrespectful to your son that way. And if she\u2019s not invited, she\u2019s not welcome. She\u2019s not entitled just because she is their mother.", "NTA. If she had made attempts at fixing her relationship with her children, she probably would have gotten an invitation. And your sister is no brighter", "NTA!\n\nBoth kids went no contact with their bio mother as soon as they were legally allowed to.\n\nThat's says it all.\n\nShe had to have done other things besides the cheating then moving in with her affair partner.\n\nRespect your kids and their decision to go no contact, and their decision to exclude her from your Son's wedding.", "Happened to a friend. The mother was seeing someone else and initiated the divorce. Both kids held it against her and moved in with the dad as soon as they could. When the daughter got married she crept into the back of the church and left as quickly before anyone could talk to her. That's how it goes.", "NTA - Your son doesn't want her there. Respect his wishes. You bring a +1 that you'd be proud to introduce to the rest of the family.", "NTA. It\u2019s your son\u2019s decision. I am no contact with my parents. Most ppl don\u2019t go no contact without a good reason. Your ex has had plenty of time to build a relationship with your kids. She has failed. It sucks but you can\u2019t do anything about it. Individual and family therapy is always there, if you are able.", "Omg YWBTA if you brought a guest to your son\u2019s wedding who purposely was not invited. That would be such a cruel way to ruin his special day if you brought her!! Who even gives a crap if YTA if you say no- your son doesn\u2019t want her there!!!", "The audacity to ruin your family then complain when your adult children cut you out. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou already did what you can do. You asked them to be civil to their mother 6 years ago. If your ex still unable to mend their relationships during all those years, it's not your fault. \n\nYou are right. They're already an adults. They can choose their own paths now. You don't need to pressure them to do anything they don't want.", "NTA", "NTA\nYour son is an adult and can make his own choices about who attends his wedding.", "NTA your sister is though. She\u2019s ridiculous. How they heck can she expect you to \u201cmake\u201d your 22 year old son invited his mother to his wedding. The only thing that\u2019ll accomplish is pissing him off and maybe having your own invite revoked.", "NTA - You are simply supporting your kids.", "NTA\n\nWhat\u2019s hilarious is that she forgot she has nothing to threaten you with anymore.", "ESH.  I have a pretty low tolerance for cheating in marriages (and have ended friendships with cheaters) but rather than quoting the risk of going to court and telling them to be nice until they\u2019re 18, you could\u2019ve said \u201cI\u2019m hurt by your mom\u2019s choices but that\u2019s an adult problem to be worked out, not a kid problem to be involved in. She\u2019s still your mom and I hope you can work on your relationship with her and move past this. You have two parents who love you even if they\u2019re no longer married to each other.\u201d  \n\nYou\u2019re NTA to not make her your plus one for the wedding but I\u2019d likely have said to them that their mom should be invited to the wedding.  It\u2019s not your job to fix your kids\u2019 relationship with their mom but you certainly didn\u2019t encourage them to work through problems with her, just told them to bide their time.  I think that\u2019s AH-ish.", "NAH.  There might be growth and reconciliation in the future, but there's no need for you to play any role in that process.", "ESH. They are adults chronologically but they are both living home and young. So not really adults with life experience.  I don't believe that you should bring your wife as plus 1 but I think your son will be sorry down the road if she is not invited to the wedding.  Affairs don't happen out of nowhere. I am not excusing it or making excuses for her but life happens. Were you the perfect husband? She felt heard and loved? And again, not excusing but affairs rarely happen in a vacumn. And she is still with this guy so it wasn't random. \nShe doesn't need a first dance or to bring the husband. But she should be there.", "NTA, but I would encourage them to try to see their mother without the AP being present, as a precursor to inviting her without the AP to the wedding.\n\nIf she won't compromise on that.. then that's her issue.\n\nYou could make the suggestion to her as well, but make it clear that you would be ignoring her existence if she was invited.", "Your son should consider hiring security to ensure she doesn't crash the wedding or even come as your sister's +1.", "You should forgive family when they do something inconvenient or annoying. You can forgive family for doing something midly stupid or embarrassing and they're sorry. But assholes, especially Unrepentant ones, do not get a free pass just because you're related.", "I used to be this way\u2026still kind of am, but I usually try to stop myself before I say \u201cbut she\u2019s your mom\u201d or whatever.  After reading these stories and replies I get why people go NC.  Just not sure if I could do that, but I also know it\u2019s situational.  My parents are gone and I miss them daily.  We weren\u2019t the perfect family by any means, still aren\u2019t.  I wasn\u2019t invited to my nieces wedding cuz I was not excited she was engaged\u2026so, then I wonder if I\u2019m the toxic one in the family.", "Eh, she is sad she doesn\u2019t get to swan in on a big day with her \u201cmother of the  groom\u201d corsage and have everyone watch the mother/son dance, but it sounds like she wasn\u2019t much interested in the daily grind of being a mom or a wife.  (OP doesn\u2019t say much about whether the boyfriend stuck around.)", "She didn't lose her family.   She kicked them to the curb.", "You're definitely making excuses, and blaming op on top.\n\nI'm not saying that you're doing this, but some people tend to project their problems on the op on this subreddit. Thats why they reach and fill in the blanks for theirselves to come to wacky conclusions that they have no way of justifying other than their hunch. Again, I'm not saying you're doing this but it does happen sometimes.\n/s", "That's for the son to decide. Nobody has the right to override the bride's or groom's choice of wedding guests.", "Yes, she lost her family due to her own actions."]}
