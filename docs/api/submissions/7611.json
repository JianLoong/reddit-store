She had 6 years to figure out how to at least repair enough damage that her kids wouldn't go no contact the moment they were able. Sounds like the opposite happened. NTA", "NTA. ....but your sister is. \n\nI don't know what is with people pushing family members to reconcile simply because they are blood related, but it's something that needs to stop. People are allowed to choose who they want in their lives, and just because someone helped create you doesn't mean you have to choose them.", "NTA. Your kids made the decision on their own about their relationship with her and you didn\u2019t force them. Your ex chose to have an affair. Your son is an adult and gets to choose who comes to his wedding.", "Definitely NTA, your ex fucked around LITERALLY and found out.  She alienated them, not you and she's paying the price.", "NTA. It seemed like you did your best to encourage them to have some contact with their mother. But they are adult now and can decide whether they want to or not and they clearly decided.", "NTA. You respected your son's wishes as to who he wants at your wedding. You rightly refused to try to run an end-around the guest list.", "NTA. It sounds like the kids have thought this through. Your ex paid a very high price for her choices.", "Nta, life isn't fair, and you and/or your sister can not and should not change your kids' minds. \n\nIf your sister wants to take your ex-wife to the wedding as her plus one,  she can do that.  It's not her place to force you to do it. \n\nThe bottom line is tho that your son does not want your ex-wife at his wedding, and no one should help her to get into a wedding when the groom does not want her there.", "NTA. You are leaving the decision to the kids who are now grown. It is not your problem anymore. The mother should have thought about all of this before cheating. You did everything right and I commend you for it.", "NTA.  Sounds like three people are sensible.", "NTA. First, you seem like an amazing father handling this all so well. It seems like your kids are both mature adults who can make there own decisions.\n\nI'll take this a step further, YWBTA if you took your ex to the wedding when it is clear your son does not want her there.", "NTA. I can't imagine how hard it was for your kids to have to spend 1 week a month with their mom and her AP. It does you and them credit that you talked to them and they listened and got through it, though. They've made their decision and you made it clear they didn't have to do it for your sake. This is their decision, they're adults now and that's that.", "NTA. She had plenty of time to try family therapy and make amends to her children for her actions, and it doesn't sound like she did enough for them.\n\nIt sucks for her, but she got caught cheating, and this is what happens.  Sometimes, the kids \"choose sides\" as it were.", "NTA. You did your best while raising them it seems, and if they decided to cut contact then that is 100% their decision.", "Your sister is being empathetic, and putting herself in your ex's shoes - your ex is no doubt heartbroken, but it is as a result of her own actions, that broke 3 more (far more vulnerable) hearts.  Your sister should extend your son the same empathic courtesy. Ask her to imagine that if she was saying her marriage vows, would she want the home wrecker who wrecked *her home, specifically* there - her biggest, most personal example of how to destroy a marriage. Also, anyone who thinks your kids feelings are extreme should not forget - *the kids discovered her infidelity first, and were forced into a traumatic position of either betraying you, or ending their own family unit*. Yea easy NTA for you and your son. F your ex wife.", "NTA. I\u2019d guess there are other toxic things about her behavior that essentially repulse them for them to both go NC. In any case, it\u2019s their right as autonomous human beings. You did everything you should\u2019ve done to make them aware they didn\u2019t need to do anything for your sake. You\u2019d be really setting everyone up for some drama if you for any reason caved to your ex\u2019s demands\u2026that WOULD make you TA. It\u2019s your son\u2019s choice who he invites to HIS wedding, as you explained.", "NTA. Your son's wedding, therefore he gets to say who may come. It's an occasion you want to share with the people you hold dear in your life. Sucks for ex-wife but if she doesnt get the cut, then she doesnt get the cut.\n\nStill less traumatizing than seeing your mother who was still on an existing marriage get it on with another man at such a young age too", "NTA. All the damage was caused by her, and it looks like she never tried to change what happened. To redeem herself. She can get the no contact and be happy with it.", "NTA. It seems to me that she maybe didn\u2019t make them a priority when they were with her. She probably was more fixated on her boyfriend then her children if she never realized something was wrong and they decided to go no contact. I like that you don\u2019t bad mouth her and actually have an adult conversation with them.", "NTA. \n\nI'm not sure what convoluted logic your sister is using to get to the decision that your son isn't mature enough to decide if he does or doesn't want someone in his life. Or how exactly you're supposed to \"make\" him do something he's decided not to do. He's 22, an adult,  starting his own family, and his decision to go no contact sounds like it was a long time coming. \n\nMake no mistake - had your said yes to your ex that would have been a huge AH move. You did the right thing.", "NTA.\nI don't believe you turned your children against your ex, they are the ones who discovered the infidelity, and it sounds like theu were both old enough to understand what she did.  You did your best to keep the peace through the years of shared custody.\nYour son, while young, is an adult, and has every right to decide who to associate with and who to invite to his wedding.  Bringing her would be a slap in his face, and would very likely endanger your relationship with both of your children.\nTell her that her relationship with the children is not your problem to fix. I'd suggest to her that seeing a therapist might be a good idea, to talk with someone objective, and see where things went wrong.  (She won't, she will, by the sound of things, lose her mind, but you will know you tried.)", "NTA - I can't say it loud or strongly enough - NTA!!!\n\nYou hit the nail on the head, that they are, for all intents and purposes, adults, and can make their own decisions and choices. If your son wanted his mother at his wedding, he would have invited her - period. And from what it sounds like, that's what he told you. \n\nBesides, think about what would happen if you did take her. You are then putting your son in a situation of having someone at his wedding that he didn't want there, plus I'm fairly confident in saying that his mother would  likely take the opportunity to guilt trip, complain, wine, moan, etc about his he didn't invite her. Nothing good can come of it.", "NTA\n\nIt obviously sucks for her that she has lost her family but she cheated so I'm not sure what she expected. You are absolutely right that you shouldn't take her as a plus one if the son specifically did not invite her.\n\nIt would be nice if the kids could maybe let her be part of their lives but if family was so important maybe she could have been faithful or tried to be a better to them after the fact. The only way you'd be an asshole here if you did in fact do something to turn them away from her but you'd know if you did that or not.", "NTA\n\nYour son doesn\u2019t want her there. It is his day and you would be an A H if you brought her.", "NTA. Your son is an adult and has made the choice to not invite his mom to his wedding. By not taking her or forcing him to invite her, you are simply respecting his wishes", "NTA Your son is an adult now.", "NTA the kids need therapy, obviously, but it's his wedding and you'd risk ruining your relationship with both children if you actually did take her, not to mention the absolute hole this would create for your ex wife if she ever wants to rekindle a relationship with her child. If she wants to be in her child's life she needs to start respecting their decisions and their boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact your kids immediately moved back in with you and started living with you full time the moment they turned 18 shows how much their mother's actions affected them.\n\nIf you was to take your ex with you as your plus one to the wedding you would be TA because that is disrespecting your son's decision in not inviting her. At the end of the day it's his wedding\n\n>I was telling my sister what happened and to my surprised she said my son wasn\u2019t being fair and I should make him invite his mother to the wedding\n\nFairness is irrelevant since this wedding is your son's. Your sister's suggestion of making him invite his mother to the wedding is a sure fire way to cause your son to go no contact with you as well. I highly suggest you don\u2019t take her advice", "NTA. You have no obligation for your ex to be your plus one, if anything that may even make the situation worse. \nYour children are adults, your son did not invite her, that's it. Now, you can have discussions with him to invite her but it's a fine line between that and badgering.", "NTA\n\n...and stay out of it.  If she ends up being invited, don't be the one to take her.  He didn't invite her for one simple reason.  He doesn't want her there.\n\n.", "NTA, this is between your son and his mother.  The worst possible outcome would be for you to surprise him by bringing her as your plus-one.", "You\u2019ve done well in your co-parenting. More than some people would in considering an ex cheating spouse\u2019s feelings, talking to your children about her. That\u2019s all totally on her. And she got caught by her kids? Whew, NTA.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t force your son not to invite his mother. She cheated and broke up the marriage. You should not have to take her as your date especially when she has a live-in boyfriend.  It\u2019s inappropriate. Your son is a grown man and has the right to invite whoever he wants to his wedding. It is the respectful thing to do to invite both of your parents, however he must have his reasons for not inviting her.", "Your ex fncked around and (got) found out, now she's reaping what she sowed - she has no one but herself to blame. Also, your children are plenty old enough to decide for themselves, so respect their wishes. Carry on as you have and stay away from the ex. **NTA**", "NTA\n\nYour ex-wife had plenty of time to build a relationship post-separation but failed dismally.\n\nIt would be a stark betrayal of your son's wishes to invite her when he had explicitly excluded her. Weddings are stressful and hectic enough without adding an uninvited NC parent.", "NTA. I honestly think you handled this as well as one could - you let the kids make their own choices, engaged them in conversation to get a better understanding, and ultimately respected their decision. Your ex had no right to anything beyond asking, and her threats after being told no demonstrate how your son made the right choice. If she went I suspect there would have been drama.", "NTA.", "Your daughter was 12 when she caught them. I am sure that was a very traumatic event for her. What did your ex wife expect was going to happen? It sounds like she still has no remorse for what she did.", "NTA, your son is getting married, he is a full grown adult and he has made the decision not to invite his mother, that is his adult choice, respect that.", "NTA, your son doesn't want her there. Obviously there's a reason she didn't get an invite, it wasn't an oversight.", "NTA", "NTA. Your kids knew about the cheating and made their own judgements. I chose not to tell my kids about their dad cheating because I know they\u2019d never speak to him again. I\u2019ll tell them if they ask once both are 18. You have done your best to keep a relationship between the kids and their mom. Idk what more she could ask for. I\u2019m honestly amazed they agreed to stick it out as long as they did. \n\nShe needs to appreciate the gift your kids and you gave her of them sticking round as long as they did. I hope my ex one day appreciates me keeping my mouth shut.", "Nta Well well well if it isn\u2019t the consequences of her actions she made her bed let her lie and it honestly I would block her and completely leave her in the past it is what it is let your kids make their own decisions they\u2019re old enough to know what they want better off like this anyways don\u2019t go against your son\u2019s wishes for her she had plenty of time to try to make it up to them and obviously they\u2019re not willing to forgive her it\u2019s their choice maybe one day they are but don\u2019t get in the middle of it cut or completely out She is no longer your problem", "NTA at all. Your son is the only one who gets to decide to have her at the wedding.  Why would you sister even suggest you do that?  Fair or not, your sone specifically doesn\u2019t want her there.  YWBTA if you brought her against his wishes.", "NTA. Good God, the kids found out??? That's traumatizing. Your wife doesn't seem remorseful at all. I wouldn't want to be around her, either.", "NTA but anyone who helps their mother go to that wedding without your sons explicit permission would be a huge one.\n\nYour ex destroyed her relationship with her children with her infidelity and has done no where near enough to fix it.  That's on her.", "Hell no NTA   Being his mom doesn\u2019t equal an automatic invite to the wedding, especially if you\u2019ve been a shitty mom", "NTA your son and daughter are adults, they didn\u2019t haste to cut off their mother. Your ex is delusional if she believes she can force or cheat her way into your grown children life and your sister has no idea of what she\u2019s talking about.", "NTA - Your wife is experiencing what rational people refer to as \"consequences\".  She is responsible for her relationship with her children.  She has had several years to work on regaining ground lost due to the way your marriage ended.  Either she didn't try hard enough or your children simply are not interested.  Neither is your issue.  All you can do by pushing at them on this topic is create damage to your own relationships with them and you don't owe your ex or anyone else that.  I'd suggest you ask your sister how she thinks \"fair\" works in this situation, except that it just doesn't matter--this is your son's wedding and if he doesn't want to invite her, then I guess she won't be there.  Reaping and sowing and all that.", "NTA. As many have said, your son is an adult and can make his own decisions. \n\nI'm a stepfather to two pretty great kids. Their BioDad has pretty much given up on the oldest(19) and is trying to force things with the youngest(14). The custody stuff has been strange but that's another story.\n\nIf either of them told me that they didn't want him at their wedding, not only would I respect that, I would do what I could to help.", "Nta. As OP\u2019s plus one?", "NTA\n\nShe cratered her relationship with her kids. Clearly she wasn\u2019t able to repair it in the last six years. They\u2019re adults and can choose who they want around them. You did the right thing. If you bring her your son will be pissed and you will taint his wedding day. Don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s her department. \n\nI hope she thinks getting some strange dick was worth not being a part of her kids lives.", "Definitely NTA, I don\u2019t blame your kids either. They\u2019re entitled to their own decisions without anyone else meddling.", " NTA it\u2019s not your place to invite her to the wedding. If he wanted her there, she\u2019d have an invite. It\u2019s his choice.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are exactly right, if he didn't invite her himself he obviously doesn't want her there and you shouldn't bring her. Both kids wouldn't have gone no contact without reason, so obviously she burned the bridge herself.\n\nI do have a question though; have you ever asked your kids why they went no contact with her? They both wanted to live with only you early on and then went completely no contact with her as soon as they could, so there must have been some other reason why they didn't want to be near her. All you mentioned was that they essentially suffered through visits after you told them to wait it out till they turned 18, after which they didn't talk about it much, and then you assumed they may have both gone no contact because of your feelings towards their mother. I just feel like you are skimming over the reason your kids hate being around her to this extent, because I would be willing to bet that there was something she did other cheating a half decade ago to earn full NC.", "NTA I'm sure there was some initial resentment about her \"destroying the family\", but it's been 6 years and so I assume there was more than just that to make them go no-contact. (if that's their whole reason, they probably need to go talk to a therapist, but that's a whole separate issue)\n\nNo matter what the reasons though, she wasn't invited. She has to know that her attending would cause a drama and a bunch of attention on her (which could be part of the appeal). If she just wanted to see the wedding, she could have asked if there was a chance it could be streamed or if she could see video or pictures; not the same as being there obviously, but would demonstrate her respecting his wishes while not being completely left out.", "NTA your sister has nothing to do with the dynamics going on in your and your kids lives with the ex. Thank her for her input but tell her you were only venting and was not asking for her opinion on the matter, but now that you see what her thought process is on the matter you will no longer be talking to her anymore about issues with your adult kids and their adulteress mother. \nIt\u2019s not your place also to tell your grown son who to invite to his wedding. Preserve your relationship with your children and stay out of things that\u2019s going on with their mom. Don\u2019t try to intervene on her behalf again she caused this problem and as you said your children are now grown so stay out of it!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Which was probably quite traumatic for a 12ish year old girl to witness her mom\u2019s infidelity and then have to be the one to break it to her dad. Not to mention, that\u2019s a pretty inappropriate way to learn about s** . Your son was a great big brother and support system for her. I\u2019m sure it upset him that his mom put your daughter in that position aside from breaking up your marriage and family.  He\u2019s got every reason to be angry as well. He too had to be the messenger and the bearer of bad news to you and his baby sister about mom\u2019s dirty deeds. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t appreciate having to give his sister any kind of the s** talk. No kid should have to be in the position your kids were in. \n\nPlus, They\u2019ve lived the last six years having to endure their mother and her attitude and behavior. I\u2019m guessing that she tried forcing a relationship with her affair partner on her kids too. And possibly even picked fights with them because of their distance and disgust towards her.  It\u2019s probably not as cut and dried as it seems as it sounds like your kids like to keep you in the dark regarding their mother these days. Probably because they\u2019ve already severely hurt you because of her actions and they don\u2019t ever want to do that again. \n\nAs for the wedding, You did everything correctly by not agreeing to take your ex wife as your plus one. You definitely should not be disrespectful to your son that way. And if she\u2019s not invited, she\u2019s not welcome. She\u2019s not entitled just because she is their mother.", "NTA.

He and ex had the opportunity to handle the divorce in a way that would make it ok for the kids to start repairing their relationship with their mother, and it looks like that just didn't happen. They didn't stop needing a mother when she broke up her marriage. \n\nI do think the OP said the right things now, though. He can't betray his son like that, and he owes it to his son to tell him about aunt's possible shenanigans. \n\nA wedding is not the time to bring this conflict to a head. If mom ever wants contact with him, she has to know this would torpedo her chances forever.", "No way,  my family is held to a far higher standard", "If she is blocked from communicating with son and daughter, then calling OP first is understandable. But assuming he spent the previous years alienating her from their children shows she really is out of touch with what her children were going through.", "But it's easy to think of it the way you're describing--- the matter of fact, black and white way that precludes her having the capacity for feelings one way or the other.  \n\nAlas OP's ex is exhibiting absurdly common manipulative-divorced-parent behavior. The accusations that the ex-spouse \"turned the kids against her\", trying to manipulate her way into her son's life by complaining to dad, failing to realize that spending 20% of your time in court-appointed visitation is not going to feel like \"home\", and, most importantly in this instance (I'm assuming, based on context)-- refusing to acknowledge that the means by which you sever a relationship with your spouse affects the relationship your kids will have with you and how they view you. So many divorced parents try to compartmentalize the relationships involved in a divorce (\"me vs my husband has nothing to do with me and my kids\") and while *partial* aspects of this can be true, you can't tell a kid what does and doesn't count when it comes to their family. If the way that mom treated dad changes the way the kid views mom, you bet your ass it'll affect the kid's relationship TO mom. Point-blank refusing to see this, especially in a case where you're clearly at fault for ending the marriage, means people like OP's ex genuinely lose their grip on the kind of relationship they think they actually have with their kid. \n\nThus this behavior is exploding from mom now because she hasn't had a reality check until now and feels totally blindsided. Is she right to? No. But when you compartmentalize relationships THAT much to avoid looking at the ones you ruined, you lose your sense of comparison in interpersonal relationships--- in this case, how her son interacts with other people besides her. She wasn't upset that she hadn't talked to her son in a year and that's pretty weird. But she got upset once she realized that OP *was* invited to this wedding and she wasn't. Comparison just slapped her in the face with some reality about what her relationship with her son actually means. \n\nI've seen people live in compartmentalized shells like this and I've seen how desperately skewed their perspective can get until they finally get a reality smackdown about how other people see them. I'm not saying she doesn't deserve it but that's separate from simply being able to acknowledge \"ooof, that smack has to **HURT**\". \n\nEmpathy doesn't mean apologizing for her, it's simply trying to imagine what something must feel like--- in this case what it must feel like to be so wrong about your worldview that you don't even realize it until you're excluded from your own kid's wedding, and what an earth-shattering jolt it must be to have reality finally hit you after avoiding it for so long. Just because some redditors are acknowledging that this must suck doesn't mean they believe all of her actions leading up to the situation *didn't* suck even more.\n\nEdit- a word", "My mother cheated on my dad and left, and my dad for years psychologically  damaged me and alienated her.  At one point he told me (I was around 10), that he put a gun to his head but thought of me and changed his mind.  For a long time I hated her and blamed her for hurting my dad.  As an adult I learned my mother suffers from abandoned child syndrome, and things she went through.  I also know now my dad had done/said things to her when married making fun of her body change after child birth and other things.  I also now see things that went on in a different perspective that as a child of course I didn't know or understand.  So judging a person who can empathize just goes to show you have no insight or experience on what can happen inside relationships and past traumas.", "I do sympathize with her a tiny bit, because I can understand the desperation she must be feeling right now. But she should be nowhere near this wedding, if she ever wants her son to speak to her again.", "Where are you guys getting this stuff!? Just making it up?", "Can you imagine being a 12 year old girl, finding your mom in a sexual situation with a stranger, and then having to cohabitate with that stranger against your will because a judge and your mom said you have to? That's a lot of trauma, no wonder these kids made the choice that they did.", "I think I rather prefer when they stay with their affair partners.\n\nWhen they don\u2019t, it feels like their impulsive shattering of their family was Even More pointless and makes me even angrier.\n\nMy ex-BiL destroyed my sister and then dumped his cheating partner after the divorce to soon marry a Stepford doormat type woman.  \n\nI think I\u2019d have been slightly less inclined to eviscerate him if he actually loved and wanted to share a life with his affair partner.", "That's because cheating is inherently selfish. If you can't be loyal to your own loved ones then what kind of person does that make you. Imagine how they must treat people that they don't love or care about so much. \n\nCheating when you have children is even more selfish because it's not just your partner's life you're affecting.\n\nPut it this way, have you ever met a selfless cheater?", "I'm pretty confident that it was traumatic for a 12 year old to find her mother in a sexual situation with a stranger and then be forced to live with the guy. Mom might or might not be TA for cheating, obviously we don't know what their marriage was like, but she is definitely TA for compounding the trauma her kids went through. She couldn't wait to move in with the guy until her children were out of the house? Part of being a good parent is sometimes having to sacrifice your own desires so that the needs of your children are met. \n\nBesides, the question isn't \"Is OP TA for being Big Mad years after being cheated on?\" it's \"Is OP TA for not wanting to go against his kid's wishes just because his ex wants something really really bad?\"...which if you think about it, the situation is a perfect snapshot of why these kids don't want anything to do with her.", "It doesn't help that the kids were 12 & 16 when she was caught.The 16 year old (who's now getting married) had to explain to his younger sister what she saw and would be at the age to have already started to form his own opinions on cheaters outside of anything his parents would have taught him.", "I think you have a good point about compartmentalization; I've seen people do that, too. \n\nTo be fair, we don't know that the mom wasn't upset about her son not talking to her for a year.", "You phrased this really well. \n\nI say this a lot to my now wife about my step kids and their dad.    He cheated and fortunately for him I guess, the kids are too young to be asking about that... but we've always said, we're never going to badmouth, but we're not going to lie either. So when they get older and start asking why things are the way they are, there's going to be a lot of 'splainin to do..  And just as you said, I don't see how they're going to understand what he did to their mom, and to the rest of his family (long story which I won't get into) and be cool with it.   He should be doing his absolute best to try and right the situation but when the oldest is already asking questions like: \"Why can't I go to my friends when it's my time with my dad?\"... it's uhh, complicated.", "This is so insightful. Thank you for being an adult human being.", "If she regrets cheating, why is she willing to move in with the other man? How often are you going to regret something and continue doing it? That's the opposite of regret. \n\nAfter the divorce, it's not cheating anymore but the fact that she's still with this specific person means she wanted this relationship which is the opposite of regret.", "She moved in with the guy she cheated. Maybe try reading the post?", "I mean it can be inferred from the context. She didn't talk to her son for a full year, she clearly didn't do anything in the six years post-divorce to reconcile with the kids. It wasn't just the son who went no-contact.

Your Ex Wife, definitely TA.  The kids have every right to their feelings.  And if your son does not want his mom at his wedding that is definitely valid.  But in the long run it would be healthy for them to not hold so much animosity for their mother.  Holding all that anger and hostility inside them for so long won't be healthy for your kids.  They can forgive but never forget.  They don't have to trust her or play happy family with her and her man.  But moving on from the horrible decisions she  made that caused your family to fracture might be healthier for them.", "So he had full custody and says the kids visited mom one week a month, but they moved back in with him at 18?", "I have to go against the grain here and tell you that leaving someone out of attending a wedding, especially a close family member, such as an estranged mom, can never be taken back or repaired.  Your son should be encouraged to invite her, as he may want to reconcile down the road and this snub will most certainly be a roadblock.  ESH", ">but she is your children's mother\n\nAt this point she's just an egg donor.", ">  It takes two to make or kill a marriage.\n\nIn this case the two were the ex-wife and the dude she was fucking.", "The son is NOT leaving someone out of his wedding. He expressly doesn't want her there. That is HIS and his Bride's decision. \n\nCan the relationship be repaired? Yes, but it is the decision of the child. My friend was excluded from her daughter's wedding. At the time of the wedding, her daughter was not ready for a reconciliation. 5 years later, they have an adult, respectful relationship. But it is up to the CHILD as to if and when, not the parent!", "In all seriousness we have no proof supporting or disproving that info \nWe are only here to judge what he asked. Is he the asshole for not bringing the eggsack as a plus 1.\nWe are not here to judge if he was a good or bad husband", "I get where you're coming from, but to me telling the kids, \"It's an adult problem, not a kid problem to be involved in,\" seems patronising to me.  Affairs effect children no matter the circumstances.  When you cheat in a marriage, you are cheating on your family, not just your partner.  OP made sure his kids were looked after and, more importantly, he gave them agency to make their own decisions.  They played nice until they were 18 and, having already discussed their feelings with each other, decided that they did not want their mother in their lives.  Some may say that they are children and don't know what's best for them, but that too is patronising.  Just because their decision hurts their mother, it doesn't mean the decision is not what's best for them.  If they change their mind, then they can decide to re-establish contact later in life.", "100%. I can't imagine trying to celebrate what SHOULD be the happiest day of my life with my life partner by my side only to be reminded constantly of the marriage of your parents falling apart every time you see your mother. Why would anyone want to ruin their special day like that? I wouldn't be able to shake off the feeling of \"marriages can be destroyed easily\" while I'm trying to CELEBRATE MY MARRIAGE.", "for sure!  she deserves nothing from them at all!\n\nshe may think this isn't 'fair' to her, but we all know it is!", "You do not know what cause her to have an affair.  From what he wrote, he was not forgiving and passed this on to the kids.  He could have been the worst husband but hide it from the kids.  I am not supporting the wife for what she either.", "Yep dad is 100% class.", "Agreed. NTA he has been as polite and considerate as possible to his ex (more than she deserved IMO) for the sake of his kids, and he has treated his kids as the mature people they are and with the respect they deserve as human beings. \n\nThey discovered the affair and knew it wasn't right (while young the daughter atleast understood enough to question it to her brother) and thankfully OP had raised them well enough for them to feel comfortable telling their dad without him blowing up (we have all accidentally shot the messenger once or twice I'm sure). \n\nWhen the ex-wife had issues regarding her relationship with her kids, he sat them down to talk, made sure they weren't doing it for him, and then came to a compromise or as in the new case respected their thought out decisions, they told him they had been thinking about it for a while so it wasn't an impulsive decision.\n\nOP, you have done everything right by your ex and children while your children were kids. Now that they are adults, you can continue to do right by your children by respecting their choices regarding their mother, my only suggestion is that should she ever become terminal, ask them at that time if they plan on seeing her to atleast get closure and respect those choices then as well. I doubt they will, given their stance now, but it might be good for them to hear in that moment that you are still grateful to her for giving you them (your children).\n\nETA, I definitely do agree on telling your son to have some form of security at the wedding. It doesn't have to be a hired guard or anything expensive, I'm pretty sure that he and his partner will have a couple of friends who would be willing to act as gate keepers to ensure the happy couples day goes smoothly.", "Those aren't just friends, those are his brothers.", "Need to watch out there also. She might be desperate enough.", "Security dog", "The point is not that she made good choices. The point is that reddit is making knee-jerk judgments of this woman based on only a little information from her ex-spouse. We don't know what happened or any of the context, and judging her isn't the point of his question anyway. Yet people are willing to say she's not worth basic empathy and must be a horrible mother who doesn't really care about her kids.", "The wife is Whitney Wisconsin \ud83d\udc80", "Of course!", "You have it right it\u2019s not your place to make them do anything in this regard. NTA.", "NTA - get security posted at the wedding to have her removed if she shows up", "Hardcore NTA. If anything you are being incredibly mature and understanding. You not only have respected your children\u2019s wishes by allowing them to make decisions as adults, but you have made sure that they\u2019re not feeling any pressure or guilt from you influencing them.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s parents had a messy divorce with similar outcomes when I was 23 (and my sister 18) I can say that your handling is exactly what you should be doing for yourself and your kids. I really applaud how you\u2019ve handled it.", "Great point. OP is an excellent father who supports his children in their decisions and has open communication. No wonder they respect you and wanted to live with you.", "He sounds like a great dad", "I definitely agree. However, if the sister can\u2019t get through to OP, he should send her to his son just to get her to shut the fuck up", "My hubby's and my friends got married 2 years ago, but as soon as the engagement was announced, the grooms sister started causing trouble again, this time directed at her brother/the groom. At a group, BBQ for our social circle when the groom mentioned his sister was starting shit agin (without the details) and everyone there said \"say no more, we got you.\" We all told him to focus on the legal details and keep planning the wedding. We knew her claims were false but were silently praying things went smoothly. We also made it clear that if she chose to attempt to crash the wedding, he and his bride would only find out about it the next day so they could laugh about it with us (most of us knew her in some way from school and well, let's just say we would have loved the chance to put her in her place). She never showed, but we still got to have lots of fun celebrating, and there was more than enough to laugh about the next morning at the post wedding breakfast.", "This 100%. I don\u2019t think such an harsh decision was based SOLELY on her cheating. She never did enough to redeem herself. It would a MAJOR ahole move to bring her to the wedding and 100% ruin OP\u2019s son day. NTA", "I respectfully disagree, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s trying or tried to repair anything. I think she just wants to come to the wedding so she can claim to be a doting mother and the reason her son turned into such a person as he is.", "Yea, family does make people do stupid things to try to keep the peace. My family went through a big split when people started thinking my uncle was gay. My dad was 100% on his brother's side and cut a huge chunk of aunts/cousins out of his life over it.The way my grandma handled trying to keep the peace it almost felt like she was on their side. Knowing she wasn't pro LGBT made that worse. So my dad started cutting her out too.\n\nThat was enough to open her eyes to the situation. We were never going to play nice with that part of the family again and she was just going to have to accept it. That side of the family messed up unforgivably bad by telling my very religious father that the younger brother he's very protective of is going to burn in hell for eternity. There's no taksies backsies on that.", ">\tfeel some empathy for a mother who misses her children and deeply regrets what she has lost.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think I will", "Yeah folks empathise with my mum all the time and try to make me feel guilty and question my decision and act like my mums a victim cause they feel sorry for a mum whose lost her kid too.\n\nFlip side of that one: she's an abusive monster who sexually abused me, mentally abused me, neglected me and physically abused me, the shining star on her crown of shitness being physical abuse through neglecting me so I got around 50 staph infections over the course of a year when I was like 9 and then refusing to take me to a doctor and then once the infections got huge and painful enough forcibly and painfully squeezing them. Or making me squeeze them under threat of her doing it instead. Cool lady, love it when people extend her empathy that they'd never dream of extending to me.\nLove that because shes a \"mother\" and our society has this stupid obsession with pretending that mother automatically = literal saint I get to hear about how sad my going NC is for a woman who fingered an 8 year old lol\n\nAlso the assumption of regret is ridiculous, not saying OPs ex was as cooked as my mum (could've been tho you never know) but I can assure you fucked folk lile this have only one regret and its the fact that the NC exposes them (partly) for who they truly are. And to protect their public image and frail sense of self they will often pretend to be hurt and to miss their children. My mum posts pictures of me online on my birthday still and people care react that shit, probably because they feel bad for her too. Man why is it fucking always about having empathy for the people who have hurt and abused others and not the other way around? If I got a shred of the empathy I've seen extended to my abusers and other abusers in my community I'd probably have a lot less trust issues and much better mental health lol.", "Oh, that's exactly what I meant when I said this is the only reason she's interested in repairing things. Not because she wants to improve the relationship and take ownership of where she went wrong, but because she wants to be mother of the groom.", "Ehhh I know 2 separate families where the Dad cheated, and the kids of those families barely talk to their fathers. Tearing apart a family is enough of a reason for a lot of people", "Cool, hopefully there isn\u2019t too much drama around keeping her out. Sounds like the whole family has had enough BS already", ">possible OP is a great father & was a not-so-great husband.\n\nVery possible.  I have known people like this.  Or even that both people are great people but together they are toxic."]}
