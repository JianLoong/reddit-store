My mom watches him all day while she\u2019s at school but Jenna has to stay home pretty much all the time when she\u2019s not at school because my mom won\u2019t watch him more than she has to. I\u2019ve had to take care of him a lot. I am taking very rigorous classes and am involved in a lot of extracurriculars so I have very little free time. \n\nMost days I don\u2019t get home until 6 and then Jenna asks me to watch him for a bit before dinner so I usually don\u2019t get to start doing my homework until after dinner at like eight. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gotten more than five hours of sleep on a school night in weeks. When I do have time to sleep, I get woken up every few hours by a crying baby. I\u2019m on track to be valedictorian and my grades are suffering because of Jenna\u2019s kid. \n\nMy dad never found the milk so there\u2019s nowhere else I can go. I\u2019m stuck here. I decided I\u2019m done watching her baby so now I just go to the library or a friend\u2019s house after school and don\u2019t come home until 9. On weekends I leave the house as early as possible and come home at night. Jenna said that she needs me to stay at home a little more because she can\u2019t watch a baby without any help all day. I told her that she chose to have that kid and he\u2019s her responsibility. \n\nShe said that her mental health is suffering because she can\u2019t go out much since I stopped watching him and I need to help her because we\u2019re sisters. I said that I don\u2019t give a f*ck about her and her baby and if she doesn\u2019t want to watch him then she can get a job to pay for a babysitter. She\u2019s mad at me now and she told my mom. My mom said she can\u2019t make me do anything but she\u2019s disappointed that I\u2019m so selfish and she can\u2019t believe that she raised an uncaring brat like me. AITA?\n\nEDIT: The baby\u2019s dad\u2019s parents pay child support but they don\u2019t want to be in his life. The dad goes to another school so they have pretty much zero contact. We live in California so abortion is easy to access but Jenna chose not to abort even though her parents encouraged her to. Her mom lives three hours away and her dad doesn\u2019t watch the kid because that\u2019s \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d.\n\nEDIT 2: It was wrong of me to say I don\u2019t give a duck about the kid.

You don't *need* to help her, because you're not that kid's parent.    \nAny responsibility towards that kid begins and ends exactly where you say it begins and ends.

As for your mom, tell her that you did care until it started impacting your own mental health and schoolwork and that, if she had stepped in to at least reduce the amount of time you were expected to watch him, none of this would have happened and that you may be an uncaring brat, but she's a bad mother.", "NTA.

Therefore, she help for 10-11 hours 5 days (50-55 hours) and that doesn\u2019t account for the help you provide on the weekends.\n\nI\u2019m sorry but what does your stepsister think having a baby would be like? A bag of rainbows and hugs? \n\nYour mom can\u2019t say anything because she set a boundary in regard of taking care of the baby - only during school time.

This might help cut down on your sleep loss.\n\nBTW, the reason your Mom might be upset with you is because she (Mom) expects to get stuck babysitting even more if you aren't involved.

You're not required to \"help out.\" If you get started agreeing to watch the kid, it won't be long before she is making weekend plans all the time to leave him with you. With the approval of your mom, it sounds like. \n\nThe fact that your mom wants you to focus less on becoming valedictorian so you can watch this baby more often baffles me.

I find it a little hard to believe that thats the case. I can understand you're really frustrated with the situation. But even then a more compassionate approach is possible. It's good that you're taking care of yourself first. But you'll have to consider what is more important to you. Keeping those family connections tight, or putting your focus on school and your own life. If you choose to step away completely regardless (that's your right, because there is no right or wrong), then at least just explain calmly and show some sympathy.\n\nRegarding your mother, it seems a little strange that she just expects you to watch the baby. I would think you would have had conversations with the three of you, about how things would work after the baby was born. There is an adult role here that needs some fulfilling.", "Here\u2019s the thing, of course you\u2019re NTA for wanting to focus on yourself and your studies, and I\u2019m sure the implied expectation from your family to share this responsibility makes you feel like pushing back even more. Take care of yourself, for all the reasons everyone here says. That said, just one thing, once you firmly establish your position and boundaries, however you need to do it (I know it feels unfair to have to push back against this since it probably feels like it should have nothing to do with you), if you really want to be \u201cnot an asshole\u201d in life in general, you could offer the abundantly graceful offer of helping out *once in a while* to give her a couple hours off, maybe even just once a month, or whatever. It\u2019s not an obligation of course, and you should definitely stand up for what\u2019s healthiest for you, but since this sub can be very black and white about things, I just want to point out that if morality is something you think about, take care of yourself first, *then* offer any help you\u2019re willing to give. If it works out that that\u2019s feasible. Because there\u2019s life lessons to be learned about helping out people in shitty situations, but only if it\u2019s coming from a genuine and healthy place for you. So, it\u2019s like airplane rules, put your oxygen on first, then, if you\u2019re comfortable and able, maybe you can offer one small niceness that\u2019s will feel large to your step sister once she (presumably, in the future) knows you\u2019re not a doormat, and knows to take your kindness graciously as well. This is more about future advice because yes, right now, go ahead and take care of what you need to first, and when established boundaries are established, see if you feel like helping a bit later. That\u2019s all. Things will adjust, many people here will advise you to burn it all down and for all them to go fuck themselves, but life isnt really like that always, so say no right now, but consider offering the possibility that you\u2019ll be a fun/helpful aunt later, assuming all involved respect you as well. You could become a close loving family in the future, despite how hard it is on everyone right now, I\u2019m only suggesting you leave that door open.", "NTA ofc. Question.

I am taking very rigorous classes and am involved in a lot of extracurriculars so I have very little free time. \n\nMost days I don\u2019t get home until 6 and then Jenna asks me to watch him for a bit before dinner so I usually don\u2019t get to start doing my homework until after dinner at like eight. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gotten more than five hours of sleep on a school night in weeks. When I do have time to sleep, I get woken up every few hours by a crying baby. I\u2019m on track to be valedictorian and my grades are suffering because of Jenna\u2019s kid. \n\nMy dad never found the milk so there\u2019s nowhere else I can go. I\u2019m stuck here. I decided I\u2019m done watching her baby so now I just go to the library or a friend\u2019s house after school and don\u2019t come home until 9. On weekends I leave the house as early as possible and come home at night. Jenna said that she needs me to stay at home a little more because she can\u2019t watch a baby without any help all day. I told her that she chose to have that kid and he\u2019s her responsibility. \n\nShe said that her mental health is suffering because she can\u2019t go out much since I stopped watching him and I need to help her because we\u2019re sisters.

I think it should be incredibly easy to put kids up for adoption. Put out pamphlets advertising different agencies and let the parents put the kid up for free. I just don't like and I'm not comfortable with the idea of being deleted out of assistance because somebody is going to lose their job over it.. Same with rape, y'all can abort if it's rape. I'm just uncomfortable with people performing abortions because the kid is going to inconvenience their life. Mainly because I could have been an abortion. I just kind of stick my head in the sand and don't think about the abortion issue much because it's such a sensitive topic. One of my friends was almost aborted and if her parents had chosen to abort her she would have never been born. To pretend otherwise is to be an idiot.

She's just a 16 year old girl who is overwhelmed with trying to stay in high school while also being a single mother. Not saying it's anyone's fault but her own, but I don't think it's fair to claim this child's existence annoys her. In all probability, she most likely loves her baby very much; she's just facing the actual reality of what it's like to juggle being a first-time parent while trying to graduate high school, all with minimal support. No wonder she is overwhelmed. The child's father has zero contact with this baby, his parents don't want anything  to do with the kid, her own father refuses to help her at all, and her stepmom watches the child as little as possible. She has zero life outside of school and mothering this baby. And she isn't even an adult herself yet; she probably has very little in the way of life skills. Again, no one's fault but hers and the baby's father's... But can we try to have a little empathy for her situation here? She loved this child enough to want to keep it, and we all know that reality is oftentimes much harder than the rosy picture in our heads of how we think things will go.", "I\u2019m adopted and my adoptive parents resent me because I didn\u2019t turn out the way they wanted/envisioned, so that doesn\u2019t always resolve that issue. \n\nEither way, some kids just get screwed.

I also wouldn't have wanted to be away from him all day. The fact that she goes to school for 8 hours a day while stepmom watches the baby, then comes home and expects her sister to watch him for a few hours proves that she is more worried about herself than anyone around her, including the baby. Being a mom, rather old or young, means that you don't get to do whatever you want. I think she has plenty of help compared to what other young moms have. She sounds selfish. There is no way she didn't know that choosing to have this child would change her whole life. At this point, the child is here, and she needs to put on her big girl panties and take care of her own child. It's sounds harsh, but it's true.", "This is a great response.", "I'm really sorry about that. They never should have had kids, they probably would have fucked up any biologicals as well."]}
