He was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and died all in a matter of a few months, we were both devastated. My Godfather was the person we both turned to the most for personal and financial advice. He was an accountant, and an overall financially savvy guy, who had amassed an estate of over $1m when he died.\n\nI wasn't able to attend his funeral as I was living in a different country, and it was during the pandemic. I had known since I was little that my brother and I were in our Godfathers will, as he had no children, no family, and had known us since we were born. I had never spoken to my parents about how much I would inherit as it's tacky and disrespectful to my Godfather, but my parents would keep my updated with how things were going with the sale of his house, cars, etc. \n\nIt wasn't until recently that I was telling them about how I was struggling financially that my mum broke down in tears on the phone. She said that she didn't know how to break the news to me as she was upset and and angry, but the house and assets were sold ages ago and the estate was already disbursed. My brother, who was also one of the executors of the estate, told my mum that my Godfather had rewritten his will a few months before he passed (but after he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor) and had written me out of his will completely. His reason was that he had already given me my inheritance as a lump sum. I started crying and felt betrayed as i had never received anything. My mum then said, that she knew I hadn't come into that much money because would have noticed (I'm not exactly subtle with my shopping habbits), she then asked my brother if there was anyway that he would share the money that he inherited since I had be written out under false pretenses. My brother flat out refused, saying that it is his money and that he isn't required to share it. My mother is extremely disappointed in my brother because our situations are very different. He is very comfortable financially, married, owns a house (which my Godfather gifted him the deposit for), and also inherited 2 cars and a motorcycle from my Godfather.\n\nThis happened a year ago, and I have only just found out. My brother and I already didn't get on well, but this just feels like the final straw. I can't bring myself to speak to him, and I don't want someone who is selfish in my life. I understand that I sound jealous, but I have been compared to my brother my whole life, I will never be as successful as him, and he knows this is the only way that I will ever be able to afford to buy a home. AITA?\n\nEDIT: My brother is not the only beneficiary of the estate. My Godfather had a long-term girlfriend who got 50%. I consulted with a lawyer who said that if I were to successfully contest the will, then his previous will would come into effect. I do not know when his previous will was written, and I can't be sure if his girlfriend was in it. I didn't want to risk her losing her inheritance, just so that I could get mine. My brother and I had been in my Godfathers will since we were born, he asked my parents permission to include us, and he had always treated us equally. He knew I was constantly compared to my brother and was my biggest supporter when it came to carving my own path and getting out of his shadow. I'm not angry at my brother because I think he did any malicious, I am angry because he knows that the reason I was written out is false and that my Godfather wanted me to inherit some of his money.", "created_utc": 1685235406, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tnchi/aita_for_cutting_my_bother_out_of_my_life_after/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However short of suing him, there isn't a whole lot to do. \n\nThat the will states you were given \"a lump sum\" you never received is something your attorney and your brother's attorney need to discuss, esp. if your brother was acting as executor or a conservator.

Your Godfather was probably influenced by your brother in his diminished mental capacity and in your absence. Cut him off 100%. Don\u2019t look back.

I bet your brother asked Godfather for money on your behalf and kept it for himself. I would confront your brother since he was an executor because you know it's not true that you received a lump sum at any time while GF was alive. Your mother knows what her son is, if your father is around, he does, too.  Your brother is toxic and should be cut off by your entire family.\n\nPerhaps your brother submitted a phony will to probate or worked on your GF to write a new will while he was very ill.  If I were you, I would check to see what the will actually said.  It is only possible, I think if you are a beneficiary.  But on the off chance that the will wasn't changed but your brother kept your inheritance for himself (easy enough to do as executor with a non-demanding beneficiary) then you have grounds to sue him. Sorry, OP, what a pig.", "My thoughts exactly - brother is the executor of the will, and coincidentally the will was rewritten to benefit him? Smells like undue influence to me.", "My mom didn't want to tell me because she knew how hurt I would be, and she was trying to persuade my brother to share some of it. Everyone except my brother is confused as to why my Godfather thought he gave me a lump sum.", "NTA, but agree on all the questions. Wouldn't it have been the logical move to ask you whether you had actually received a lump sum instead of hiding it during a whole year and putting you in a worse position to contest? Did she just naively think your brother would eventually relinquish part of his inheritance even though he had already said no multiple times? Did she not find it weird that he was the executor and suddenly now the only inheritor?\n\nAlso, I don't really know how it works, but in case you contest it and the money is redistributed, I guess there's nothing stopping you from giving your godfather's girlfriend her share.", "I have seen the will. I did consult with a lawyer to see if I could contest it, but since it was distributed a year ago or more, it would be extremely difficult to access any of the money. Also, if this will were voided, then his previous will would come into effect. I don't know how long ago that one was written, and he had a long time girlfriend when he died. I wouldn't want her to lose her right to her share of inheritance.", "He never did, that's why my mom asked him if he would give me some of his share.", "My Godfather had never given me any money over the years except birthday and Christmas money, like he had done with my brother. That is why my mom had an issue with me being written out of his will because it seemed like he had mistakenly thought I had already received something.", "Yeah, OP needs to pursue this legally. It's clear the brother pulled something.", "In that case, he's technically right. And there's no reason to suspect that he did anything malicious to get it all himself.", "Maybe it was her that screwed you. It\u2019s worth pursuing.", "Does it not seem odd to anyone that -\n\nyou live outside of the country, your godfather gets diagnosed, decides to rewrite his will and \u2014-\n\nThe only person GF told he gave you your inheritance already was your brother\u2014-\n\nThe one who got everything! \n\nI\u2019m calling shenanigans on your brother.

I didn't want to contest the will because I don't know if his long term girlfriend was in his previous will or not. I don't want to gain my inheritance at the risk of someone deserving losing theirs. I'm not that person.", "Have you read the will?", "Then that was the inheritance he already gave you.\n\nBe grateful for what he gave you and don't take this out on your brother.", "You have no legal standing to contest the will.\n\nYou aren't an heir or devisee.", "Except it wasn't. He explicitly told me and my parents that I was in his will. He intended for me to get money, but mistakenly thought he had given me a lump sum.", ">Then that was the inheritance he already gave you.\n\nHe didn't, that's the point.\n\nAre you the brother? If not, please work on reading comprehension. OP did not receive *any* inheritance or lump sum. \n\nIt seems clear the brother either was behind some fraud, or in some way influenced the Godfather to remove OP from the will for no reason. Something is amiss here.", "Found the brother.", "He changed his mind.\n\nHow often did you visit him?\nHow often did you call him?\nDid you send him gifts on his birthday?\nDid you send him gifts on Christmas?\n\n\nPeople think hard and long before signing their will.", "What I'm saying is the godfather gave OP throughout the years, and that is all they wanted to give.\n\nWhy do you think the brother was involved with changing the will.\n\nThe godfather also added hid long-term girlfriend; why would the brother have him do that? If doesn't make sense.\n\nThe godfather changed his will.", "I'll let my partner know I'm now a 30 something male.", "We spoke almost every week before I moved to another country, and I visited him every time I was back home. He was the single most important person in my life besides my parents. \n\nMy brother and I had been in his will since we were born up until he changed it a little after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.", "Except that is absolutely 100% not what happened. The will claimed OP received a large lump sum of money, which OP never received. There was NO lump sum.\n\nAnd we have no evidence that the girlfriend was not in previous wills. We don't know if she was. I do think it's harder to believe that the will was falsified if the girlfriend was included, but I also think the girlfriend would be far more likely to pursue this legally than OP. Also, that in no way is evidence that the brother didn't intentionally mislead the godfather to have OP removed."]}
