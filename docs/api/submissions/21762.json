When I still lived with my parents and family, I was 19 and still trying to adjust to life as a college student. I had bills I was required to help out with at home and my parents would only help out with college If I chipped in too- which is fair. The thing that said friend held onto though, was despite me still having my own financial responsibilities, I didn\u2019t have a rent payment. My friend, however, had moved out of his families home the year before, found a dirt cheap apartment on the scuzzy side of town and already lost it after 6 months of not managing his money and his time properly. He had already had two jobs that he quit for one excuse or another. Me and him, we\u2019re best friends. We\u2019ve been close since we were in the third grade. I love the guy. I\u2019m aware though that he\u2019s the type of person that just doesn\u2019t make all the right decisions the first time around. Not that I\u2019m the perfect person for advice on how to live responsibly ( I\u2019ve made a few unsatisfactory decisions as well and I don\u2019t hold myself to be perfect or better than my friend). He\u2019s been this way for years at this point so when he called me one day, desperate, because he was about to lose his apartment because he was short on rent, I decided because he was my friend and I didn\u2019t want him to end up on the streets, I helped him. I gave him 200 dollars to help him out, and I even told him that he didn\u2019t have to worry about paying me back right away until he had the money to pay me back. \n\nBoy, was that the wrong way to go about that. The next time he contacted me it was a speeding ticket he couldn\u2019t afford to pay. Me being generous, again, I was like, ok sure but just this once more and after that I have to focus on me. Radio silence from him after I gave him the money for that. A month later, he texts me in a panic telling me that he quit his job because he hated his manager and was behind on rent and that if I didn\u2019t give it to him in the next five minutes he was going to be homeless. It was right about then that I started to see the pattern and decided that I wouldn\u2019t help him anymore ( and I should add that at no point did he ever make an attempt to start paying me back. I would have even taken 50 a month if that\u2019s all he could manage but nope, nothing). Roughly my \u201chelp\u201d lost me almost a thousand dollars I couldn\u2019t afford to lose at the time. He was pissed at me for months, but it did force him to figure out how to better his own situation without manipulating me into basically paying for all his bills. He and I are still loose friends, we talk occasionally but aren\u2019t as close as we used to be. I haven\u2019t talked to him in a while as of now, so I have no idea if he\u2019s doing better or worse. This isn\u2019t the exact same situation, I know, but you said that your friend wanted more money once he realized you had more and got greedy and I couldn\u2019t help but think about how, if I hadn\u2019t seen what he was doing and put a stop to it then i would have put myself in a bad spot.", "There was no sponsorship deal in place.

Wow.  He is willing to bring this negativity to your friendship over $85.", "NTA lmao I don't know what I expected when I read that you \"won the whole thing\", but it was definitely more than 85$ if he was clamoring for a piece.

He could have made that a condition of you winning before you won. That wouldn't be unreasonable.
