On reading the will my dad (57) had an incredibly bad reaction to me being given the house, in ways of shouting and crying despite being given a nice sum of money within the will. \n\n(EDIT; We have known since I was 16 that the house was coming to me as my Grandmother said she would do that. She also gave my dad enough money to pay off his debt and it was a large sum. However, for whatever reason dad didn\u2019t like that my grandmother actually gave me the house even though we knew it) \n\nThis was in 2022 when we read the will and I felt I had to offer him some money from my house because he made me feel horrible. Since then he has decided that if the house sells for \u00a3400,000 he is going to take \u00a3200,000 from it. I have had no say in that it\u2019s just expected. He also decided he wanted to join our names on the will, this has not been done. He is the executor of the will and I have not received the house yet. \n\nI am now 26 and wanting to buy my own house (the house I\u2019ve been left isn\u2019t something I want) and I\u2019ve recently proposed to my boyfriend who said yes. I am at the point where I want to say no to giving him \u00a3200,000, I\u2019m willing to give a good sum to him to help him with the necessities but \u00a3200,000 is too much to part from. I need the money to put a deposit down and pay for several things, whereas he wants it for a pension. \n\nI am at a complete loss now because if I try to speak up I get regarded as a horrible son and he makes me feel guilty for wanting to set my own life up. \n\nSo AITA for wanting my inheritance but also willing and generously giving him some money to help despite being branded unhelpful and made to feel worthless? I just need some advice on how to go about it. I know if I talk to him he will get very angry and childish to me wanting a bit more of my money. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you\n\n\u2014 EDIT; thank you all so much for your advice and words. I think I\u2019m worried to lose the relationship but see that he is bullying and manipulating me and I need to think of my life now\n\n\n\u2014 EDIT3/Update; Again I wanted to say thank you so much for the support and love you guys have given me. It\u2019s been really validating having people say exactly what I\u2019ve thought but not been 100% on because of how my dad has been. \n\nJust for some clarification on a few questions that have been asked. \n\nThe house is currently rented out, all the rent goes to my dad apart from a small amount (\u00a3100) which comes to me to help me pay for my rent. I do not live with my dad, me and my partner live together. I\u2019ve never thought about living in the house but I think I may look at it again instead of buying a different one. \n\nI say about not wanting to lose my relationship with dad because he is the only family I have left. All my grandparents have sadly died and my mum left us when I was 5. However, I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments about being manipulated over the years and I think I have been. If it\u2019s not his way and I try and stand up for myself, like I\u2019ve mentioned, I get painted to be this awful son. \n\nI also have no documentation for the house I have been given as my dad will not show me anything or give me any of it. I also haven\u2019t been given the house on the will because dad is the executor and until I was 25 I wasn\u2019t allowed it (grandmothers wishes) but now I am so technically I think it should\u2019ve been transferred. \n\nToday I am going to try and ring some solicitors and see if they will help me as I just want what my Grandmother has left me to start my life as I never could have done this without her.", "created_utc": 1692727833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ydp2b/aita_for_wanting_my_inheritance_money/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
