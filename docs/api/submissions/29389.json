Instead of a full dinner, do snak things like chips and dip. S crackpot full of little smokes, veggie tray. If everyone brought something like that then lit wouldn't be hard on anyone. The parents of the kids that only eat chicken nuggets can bring a trat of those along with cookies or something.", "NTA Your first priority is to your nuclear family and it sounds like none of them were enjoying the big, extended family celebrations, not to mention they were a strain on your budget. ENJOY the holidays!", "OP, you better tell them you\u2019re going out of town or something so they don\u2019t just show up. Have a happy Christmas! NTA", "You are stuck in that horrible position where as the only ones that have your shit sort of together, they all view you guys as the \"rich\" part of the family and expect you to just do handouts, because having your shit together means you can afford it.\n\nCut em off. They will never accept that it isnt an obligation of yours and the guilt trips and flying monkeys will keep coming as long as they think there is a chance you will relent.\n\nNTA.", "We are having a small Christmas this year with just us. Period.  No explanation except you decided.", "NTA don\u2019t bring it up at all just make your plans.  If they bring up the holidays ask them what they\u2019re doing this year. If they say they\u2019re coming to your home look surprised and say I wish we would\u2019ve know we booked a holiday getaway we found a great deal.  The other end is well that is going to be awesome when can you send $$$ so I can be sure to have enough for everyone.  When they look horrified just stare at them.", "NTA. Please, please, don't give in for the sake of your wife and kids. Enjoy your Christmas with them.", "NTA\n\nI did that for very different reasons.\n\nWe had only my family (4) and my parents (2). \n\nBest decision, it ended up being a wonderful stress free day, a lot more casual, no time table, warm & loving day.\n\nIt was my last Christmas with my dad \ud83d\ude22.\nIn my heart I knew.", "NTA\nEverybody can have Christmas in their own house.  It's supposed to be an enjoyable day. If the in-laws start acting up that's their problem frankly.", "NTA. Don\u2019t fall for the guilt trip.", "NTA- they are abusing your good nature. Your family is entitled to have a nice Christmas. Don\u2019t let them guilt you into doing it again- and make a new tradition for your family of having Christmas with just them.", "NTA but tell everyone now so they can make other plans. \n\nStay firm!", "NTA.  I would just make it very clear early on that you aren't hosting Christmas.", "Nta", "NTA - when you marry & have your own little family, it\u2019s time for new traditions.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is quite NORMAL to have christmas just with your wife and your kids. If NONE Of them is willing to host, meet them at a restaurant.", "You are NTA for wanting a happy Christmas for your wife and children. You would definitely be TA if you allowed those people to intrude on that.", "NTA. You are having Christmas, and it sounds like a great one. Let them know you're not hosting if someone asks and when they make a passive aggressive comment, just let it lie there. You don't need to explain that you want a year off, you just have to stick to it. There will be guilt trips and angry words. But there will also be joy in your house for Christmas, for the first time in years. Enjoy it. \n\n\"No, we're not hosting this year.\" Repeat as needed.", "How about Christmas Eve potluck? No presents. And then Christmas as a family.\n\nRegardless of your decision, NTA.", "NTA\nTell your family you\u2019ll see them on zoom.", "Tell them immediately. They need time to plan. Don\u2019t make suggestions. Just keep saying no.", "NTA- they are taking advantage of you", "I\u2019d do a potluck with assigned dishes (ie you bring a meat dish with enough for 16, Auntie Sue will be bringing 2 desserts, Dave is in charge of salads etc.", "NTA!!! Enjoy your small Christmas \ud83c\udf84", "NTA at all! You and your family deserve a wonderful Christmas", "Nta think of it slightly differently if strangers treated you so shabby would you allow them into your life? So why would you let family into your life to treat you badly? I would just go low contact in general and also casually mention to more reasonable members of the family that you are not hosting anyone. \nBut why not? Costs to much, lots of work, my kids need more time, nobody helps, do I need to carry on?", "NTA- Noooooooooope. Don't get sucked back into it on promises of contributions etc. either. What you can all do together with the in laws is get the parents some psychological help and help clear out their place, with the aim that they provide the venue next year. There are charities that can assist, especially if the parents are elderly.", "NTA. \"We've had plenty of turns hosting Christmas and feel like it's time for others to take their turn.\" Five years per household seems fair.", "NTA stand firm", "NTA but don't wait too long to tell them even though they will be horrible about it so at least they cannot say you canceled at the last second.  And stand firm through the complaints that will be on-going.", "When it impacts your kids, that should be the clarion call to cut it out. Maybe your immediate family goes away for a cabin Christmas or tropical Christmas.", "Thank you. We will wait til they ask. If they don\u2019t we will probably plan to be away from the house on the day so if they show up we won\u2019t be there.

Thank you.", "Nope, don\u2019t let them know you\u2019ll be home! If they know you\u2019re home they\u2019ll crash your celebration.", "Exactly. One of my favorite Christmas's was the one with me at home alone because of a snow storm. Doing what I wanted, when I wanted...it was great!", "I would say something to them if they haven\u2019t asked by, like, mid-December. Because then there\u2019s an extra level where they can accuse you of not communicating or whatever. Just get in front of it and ignore any and all communication about it", "How can you be celebrating Christmas with your boys if you \"plan to be away from the house on the day\"? That makes zero sense. Running away from your own house because you don't have the spine to simply say \"we're doing Christmas by ourselves this year. Hope yours is a good one!\" That's a pretty sad example you're setting for your boys, OP.", "If they show up for Halloween you can send a message right after saying  it was good to see them because there won't be any more gatherings at your house for a while.   If you actually have the resources, planning to be away works too.", "It's not the good solution.   \nHow it's supposed to be the \"good, real Christmas\" for your kids, when they can't enjoy it in their house, have a normal, close family Christmas?  \nJust put your foot down there and stop catering to their (IL's) wishes and actions.   \nWhat are you afraid of? That they will be angry and offended and cut the contact with your family? Only good for you in this case.", "We\u2019re in Europe so fortunately Thanksgiving has not been an issue. I can\u2019t imagine.", "You need to work on developing a spine. You have been the architect of your own misery for the last 5 years. No one can walk all over you unless you *let* them.\n\nThe correct response to \u201cBut you\u2019re the only one with a house who can fit us all\u201d is \"Sorry, that doesn't work for us, if you want a big family Christmas, you'll need to arrange a venue somewhere else.\"\n\nThen just keep repeating, \"No, that doesn't work for us\", \"No, we won't be doing that\", \"No, you'll need to figure something else out\", \"I've said no, and you need to respect that and stop harassing me\". It's also helpful to say \"I've said 'no', and if you continue to bring this up, I will hang up on you.\" Then hang up on them / walk away from them **Every. Single. Time.** they bring it up.\n\nBecause you've rolled over to them for several years, it is now going to take several years to train them that you now mean business and No Means No. You just have to be strong and firm and keep up with it until they learn.", "Dumb. Grow up and do this: \n\nSend a text next week saying hey everybody just wanted to let you know that this year we are doing XXX for Thanksgiving and for Christmas we are going to do our immediate family only.

Have a roadtrip and do Christmas elsewhere.", "I have some family drama that needs to be managed too.\n\nLong experience has taught me that one is better off standing on the high ground. Any departure from that high ground gives them an opening to have a reasonable-sounding critique. Telling them rather than playing the game of waiting for them to ask keeps you on the high ground. There is some good advice here about how to enforce the boundary once you have set it.\n\nThat said, every dynamic is unique and you will know best if my experience applies in your situation.\n\nIf you want a reasonable compromise to offer them, tell them they can come for pancakes the day after Christmas. Cheap, quick, less mess, same opportunity for family togetherness.", "Why leave YOUR house for Christmas? You are still accommodating them by doing that. Stand your ground. You don't have to let them in if they show up, you don't have to take their calls if they blow your phone up, and if they beg and try to guilt you to your face, stay firm and don't engage them!!!!

Your poor kids.", "Go on vacation during Thanksgiving. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Honestly, if they want to choose the menu, have all the food they desire, and then leave without cleaning up, they're better off having their Christmas dinner at a restaurant or buffet. They're treating your home like a business that caters to them at Christmas, and that's fully at odds with what's good for you, and they need to accept that it's not working. \n\nIf you really want to have a holiday get-together at your home without feeling responsible for a big meal, then offer a time between usual mealtimes, like 2-5, make it very clear you're not offering anything other than \"light snacks\" plus whatever they contribute, and then have hard plans to leave the house at the ending time so they can't try to stay for dinner. Movie/play tickets are a good excuse to need to leave.\n\nFor gift exchanges, everyone picks a name out of a hat (there are websites for that), and buys for that person only. Or limit gift giving to one gift per kid.", "If you tell them first or wait till they ask - there would be no difference in their reaction.   \nSo better do it now, once for them all. This way they will have no way to say that you've let them know too late and now they have no time to arrange something different.   \nAnd... it can happens they WON'T ask, but just assume the Christmas is at your house and just come, without asking or invitation. After so many years of doing it they probably are taking it for granted now.   \nThere's not a rule, that every Christmas must be a big extended family gathering.   \nTheir wish to do it is NOT YOUR problem.   \nYou and your family deserve nice Christmas. Don't ruin it for them, don't let IL have their way.  \nAnd maybe it would be safer to actually stay at home, to prevent them breaking into your house and trash it?", "He can turn them away. He can let them know they are crossing a boundary, and if they don't leave and find other accommodations, THEY will be escorted off the property and put in NC or LC territory. He can make the choice not to open his door. Why coward away and pretend?", "Just don't open the door.", "NTA. Let them know you have other plans.  Do NOT share your plans or they might latch on. \"Oh, OP and family are going to the XYZ festival? Good, we'll be at their house ready to trap them into including us and footing the cost.\" In fact, maybe make it a surprise for your kids so that they don't accidentally give them too much information.

Its HER parents and siblings", "If this situation has been going on unchecked for 5 years, I doubt OP or his wife is the type to just not answer the door or turn them away.
