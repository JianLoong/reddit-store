It was completely by accident, she's lovely. She said she understood if me and my partner had plans that day. \n\nWhen my partner told me about the party he said \"its on your birthday, are you ok to go to it and we'll celebrate your birthday the weekend after?\" and I have to admit my gut reaction was no. I dont particularly want to spend my birthday at someone elses party where I wont know most people and because we have a 3yo I will be on mum duty all night because his parents will be there so wont be able to baby sit (my parents dont live close). I wouldnt be able to drink and would have to leave early to put my daughter to bed. I know from experience that my partner wouldnt sacrifice having a drink and wouldnt assume the lion's share of the parenting duty so I can let my hair down. \n\nI didnt want to tell my partner he couldnt go so I said i'll go out with my friends and he and our daughter go to the party. My friends dont live local and I dont see them often so if he goes to the party with our daughter and stays over at his parents i'll have the house to myself and everyone can stay. \n\nHe agreed but from the get go has complained about this. \"I'll have a crap night because I wont be able to drink, i'll have to leave early\", \"why dont you want to spend your birthday with me\" etc etc. On the night of the party my daughter apparently cried all night and clung to him, he couldnt chat to people, had to leave early and go to bed on his own. He says he essentially \"couldnt celebrate Amanda's birthday with her\" and its my fault. I saw my partners dad earlier that day and he didnt wish me happy birthday, nor did his mum text me which she usually would. I text her to say thankyou for my presents and she didnt reply.

Hubs and his parents can get over themselves, IMHO.", "NTA - It was your actual birthday and Amanda understood it was your birthday and didn't mind you missing the celebration. The only person that seems to be upset is the one who wasn't celebrating a special occasion themselves.  \"I'll have a crap night because I wont be able to drink, i'll have to leave early\" - Why is it OK for you to have that on your birthday? \n\nHopefully, you had a great birthday celebration with your friends. The idea that your partner and his parents are upset with you because you didn't do all of the childcare on your birthday so your partner can celebrate someone else is crazy.", "NTA, why is celebrating his ex sister in laws birthday more important than celebrating yours.  \n\n\nHis family went to her birthday party and ignored it was your actual birthday not even offering your a happy birthday.  \n\n\nNTA hubby and his family have some red flags and you need to call them out on it. He wanted you to give up your birthday so he could celebrate another womans birthday with her.", "NTA it seems he valued having his fun at someone else's birthday, more than your feelings on your birthday. If these are his priorities, it is very worrying.", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR birthday. You\u2019re allowed to have fun.", "Thankyou for all the comments so far! I'm such a people pleaser usually that there is a nagging voice in my head telling me that if people are upset with me that maybe i've been an asshole. Now theres a louder voice in my head saying it was the right thing to put myself first this time!", "NTA - However HE is. It's not even his birthday and he only had to look after his kid without you for that one day. He needs to accept that he's also a parent and if he can't be a father for that one day then that is immature. He can wait for his own birthday or another occassion if he wants to party. Is he quite spoilt by his dad and mum? Because they seem to have heard about it from him and if he did tell them and whine to them then that makes the situation even more silly.", "NTA. Oh, poor him, he had to be a present father and couldn't get drunk at a party, boo hoo. How *dare* you want to be able to enjoy / feel some sense of celebration and relaxation on your birthday! Sheesh, if he'd been willing to watch / be the primary parent for your daughter the night of the party so that you could fully enjoy yourself, he wouldn't have had to complain that you didn't \"want\" to spend your birthday with him.... but no, it was all just because **he** wanted to drink and have fun. Shame on you for wanting to do the same on your birthday. I'm glad you got to get together with your friends and have a night off.", "NTA - okay it was Amanda's party, but it was on your birthday, which means you theoretically could have double booked a party (if you had decided to throw a party yourself).  \nNow I'm not a stickler and would gladly celebrate my birthday the weekend after, but if it means I'd get to babysit a child while my partner gets to drink and dance all night on my actual birthday without acknowledging it, I'd be pretty pissed off. \n\nYour feelings are valid. But I'd consider talking about the division in labour at home, and especially child care.", "NTA. It was your birthday. However, it sucks that you couldn't be honest with your partner about what you really wanted which was to celebrate your own birthday with your own plans (not at someone else's party). Sorry everyone is cold shouldering you now.", "**\"I'll have a crap night because I wont be able to drink, i'll have to leave early\" -** I mean he literally said this which translates to \"why couldn't you have had a crap birthday so I could have a good night\". A strong NTA, he doesn't care about you or your happiness at all and his parents are probably sexists who think men shouldn't have to look after their children.", "NTA.\n\nI don't think it's bad that your partner suggested going and celebrating your birthday another day, especially for a non-milestone birthday. And I do think you should've been honest from the outset.\n\nHowever, your partner complaining about *his* night being ruined and then his parents being off with you about it? AH behaviour from them all.", "NTA\n\n You can tell your in laws that you would've gone to the party, but you had to sleep because you're tired from raising their 40yo son. And next day you had an early seancee session to read his mind, so you had to be rested.", "NTA but it sounds like you have a husband problem. He sounds very self absorbed and entitled. His parents sound about the same. It was your birthday. If it was my partners birthday and we got invited to a family members birthday party, I would not be going to the party.", "This should be a wake up call for YOU that he isn't capable to be a father or husband because :\n\n1. He wants to drink more than take care of his daughter\n2. he doesn't even know how to comfort his daughter in stressful moments and complains that he actually has to do fatherly duties ....like that aint his kid... WTF ?\n3. guilt tripping you that you don't want to spend your b-day with him  ....so that he can drink ....freaking selfish mf\n4. he wants to go to somebody else B-day instead of his partner ......WTF ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm not usually the one to jump to divorce but you are currently  a single mom raising 2 kids ....HE needs to step up", "ESH.  Your partner needs to grow up and learn to parent.  While it was your birthday, was it a big one?  50 seems like a big birthday worth celebrating in my opinion.  How freaking old are you that you can't just celebrate your birthday on a different day?  Even my kids are ok celebrating on different days.  (They are 7, 10, & 15.)  I have no idea why your in-laws are involved or pissy about this.  It doesn't seem like any of their business. Furthermore, babysitters are a thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
