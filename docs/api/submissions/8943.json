She just makes demands and expects to get her way every time. There's no way she deserves an apology.", "NTA - Honestly, seems like your grandparents should be making the call here...being a bit passive aggressive as if they were truly not taking sides, they would have given your mom a key too or told you to share it.", "NTA\n\nIf you are paying rent then it is not \"her\" house, it is the residence of both of you.\n\nIt is your grandparent's condo, when she asks tell her to ask them for a key.

It's not your place to give out the key to someone else's condo. If your grandparents want your mom to have access, it's their job to give her the key and set the guidelines. \n\nSmart move getting out of your mother's house.

If you pay her rent, you can come and go as you please.  Not only do you not have to give her a key to your grandparent's condo, you SHOULD NOT as it's not really your right to do so. Hopefully you get your own place soon and can leave all of this nonsense behind.", "OMG most of the time I think mother/daughter disputes should be worked out, but this shit mother of yours should be cut out of your life 100%.

If your grandparents didn't give her a key and express permission to use their place, she has no right to demand any of this, but it sounds like she's been getting away with completely unreasonable and selfish demands for years so it's sort of unsurprising.

While its your grandparents its also her parents so I can understand why they aren't picking sides.

Do they know she wants to use their home as a hook up house? You need to tell them.", "NTA. It's not your house to give her the key to. If your grandparents wanted her to have one they'd give it to her. Stay with your dad and and encourage him to file harassment charges if it continues.", "NTA It is up to your grandparents who uses the home in their absence. If the grandparents don't care then she has a right to use the condo. If they don't want her to use their condo then she has no right to it. Your grandparents are the only ones able to decide who uses the condo.\n\nHaving the key in your possession does not give you control of the condo. If your grandparents are ok with her using it, she could call a locksmith to make another key.\n\nI would never treat my child the way you are being treated. I have never asked my adult child to vacate the home for any amount of time for any reason. That seems very self-centered to me.\n\nThe only thing that matters here is your grandparents' wishes. It is 100% up to them who is able to use their condo. Your GPs not wanting to take sides is causing friction, because they are letting you and your mother fight it out between you. Which means they don't care enough one way or the other. Your mom is being greedy, but she is and has been putting her needs before yours for a while now.\n\nETA Your GPs have been put in a really shitty position. Someone is going to be pissed if they choose one over the other. I wish they had given you the key in order for you to look after the condo, clean and dust as needed, water the plants and things. It might not have become the problem it is if it seemed more of a job than a vacation get away.", "NTA. 1. You pay your mother rent. Even if there is no documentation/lease agreement, it still means you contribute to the functioning of the household. You should not have to leave to the space that you pay for in order to satisfy her wanting alone time. 2. Your grandparents gave you the keys to their condo, not your mother. If your grandparents do not outright tell you to give her the keys or make her a copy, you do not have to.", "NTA but it should be the grandparents decision. Them being passive isn't helpful. \n\nEither come to an agreement like she gets a weekend a month or she stops telling you to leave on weekends but she can't have it both ways. That's not right or fair. Its good that you are going to move to your dad permanently. Don't apologise either.", "NAH, but both of you are sort of entitled though.They are your grandparents and her parents. \n\n  Why don't her parents your grandparents give her a key.
