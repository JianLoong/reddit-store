It's not your place to give out the key to someone else's condo.

Do they know she wants to use their home as a hook up house? You need to tell them.", "NTA. It's not your house to give her the key to. If your grandparents wanted her to have one they'd give it to her.

Your grandparents are the only ones able to decide who uses the condo.\n\nHaving the key in your possession does not give you control of the condo. If your grandparents are ok with her using it, she could call a locksmith to make another key.\n\nI would never treat my child the way you are being treated. I have never asked my adult child to vacate the home for any amount of time for any reason. That seems very self-centered to me.\n\nThe only thing that matters here is your grandparents' wishes. It is 100% up to them who is able to use their condo. Your GPs not wanting to take sides is causing friction, because they are letting you and your mother fight it out between you. Which means they don't care enough one way or the other. Your mom is being greedy, but she is and has been putting her needs before yours for a while now.\n\nETA Your GPs have been put in a really shitty position. Someone is going to be pissed if they choose one over the other. I wish they had given you the key in order for you to look after the condo, clean and dust as needed, water the plants and things. It might not have become the problem it is if it seemed more of a job than a vacation get away.", "NTA. 1. You pay your mother rent. Even if there is no documentation/lease agreement, it still means you contribute to the functioning of the household. You should not have to leave to the space that you pay for in order to satisfy her wanting alone time. 2. Your grandparents gave you the keys to their condo, not your mother. If your grandparents do not outright tell you to give her the keys or make her a copy, you do not have to.", "NTA but it should be the grandparents decision. Them being passive isn't helpful. \n\nEither come to an agreement like she gets a weekend a month or she stops telling you to leave on weekends but she can't have it both ways. That's not right or fair. Its good that you are going to move to your dad permanently.

Mention to her all of the times how she kicked you out every weekend even when you were underage so she can be with her boyfriend not caring where he was. How she never prioritized you. Tell her that you want no contact with her. Then block her on everything. Thankfully you are over 18 so ask your dad not to talk to her about it or you whenever she brings it up.  \n\nDo you think it's possible to pay for the mortgage of your grandparents' condo?  Ask your grandparents if it's okay to pay for it and live there.  Or have some kind of contract that you are the one responsible for caring for the condo. I want you to be protected.\n\nAlso if possible, file a police report regarding the harassment.\n\nMight sound excessive but I hope you heed my warning, people like her will stop at nothing", "NTA and the fact your grandparents gave you a key at 16 and have yet to give their own daughter a key speaks volumes.", "If the grandparents wanted her to have a key, they would give her one.  I think that pretty much says it all.\n\nNTA and congratulations for your freedom from mommy dearest.", "Well, no.  OP doesn't need to talk to the grandparents about it.  Mom does.  For OP, it would be wrong of you to share the key without the explicit permission from the grandparents -- but it is not up to you to get that permission.  That's for your mom to sort out.", "Mom would make a copy or just refuse to give it back once she has it. Do Not Do It.", "NTA", "NTA. Grandparents gave you the key.  Question. Since you say your mother is jerk towards you, why didn\u2019t you go stay with your father years ago?  Don\u2019t live in your mom\u2019s drama.  If you do, then you will end up like her.", "The responsible and respectful thing to do is keep that key to yourself.  Your grandparents trusted you with that key and if they wanted her to have one too they would give it to her.  Do not give her that key unless your grandparents specifically tell you to.  \n\nIt sounds like a good thing you got out of there and I hope it works out for you!", "NTA. But you should talk to your grandparents ASAP to get something in writing or email saying that you legitimately have the key. \n\nBecause your mother could either give them some BS story about you wrecking the place to get them to go with her instead, or she could tell the local police that YOU stole HER key and try to get your key seized.", "NTA don't give her the key.", "Nta\n\nWoman needs to learn she can\u2019t ALWAYS have her cake and eat it too, sad it\u2019s her daughter having to teach her.", "NTA- If they wanted her to have a key they would have given her one, they feel stuck and still haven't given her a key or told you to give her the key. Block your mom till she gets over herself , tell your dad to do the same.. you avoid the headache by blocking her on everything.", " NTA FOR REAL your mom is acting like a child with a toy. Take your peace and quiet and gfto", "IF OP's grandparents wanted to give a key to the mom they would have.  It's not OP's key to give away or duplicate.  NTA. But the mother truly is.", "Bet she still wants \u2018rent\u2019 money NTA.  Your mom sounds very full of herself and only cares about her and using people", "The conversation that OP needs to have is make sure they understand that it is not OPs decision and they (grandparents) need to step up and deal with it.", "NTA. If the grandparents wanted her staying there, they would have given her a key. Yeah they may be verbally staying out of it, but I think that they didn't give OP's mom a key speaks volumes.", "NTA and don't give her the key.", "NTA\n\nYou have a key to another house, where apparently there\u2019s room for you. Move out, and stop paying her rent.", "INFO: why are the grandparents leaving this to the kid to deal with? I understand not wanting to be caught in the middle but this is their condo. They\u2019re the ones with the right to make this decision.", "Nta the mom would probably end up staying the week at the grandparents condo and then the weekend at their house and then OP wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to go on the weekends like she needed to. Good for her for staying with the dad. Mom sounds entitled AH", "NTA.\n\nSecure all of your things, OP and then leave her a note that reads: \"Wish granted-you have the whole house to yourself!\"", "So pay rent to your grandparents and/or your dad according to time you stay in each.  Mom is not receiving rent now, right.", "Wow she sounds like a treat. NTA. Recommend cutting contact or going LC.", "NTA", "I feel like if your grandparents wanted your mom in the condo, she\u2019d already have a key. Why does she need yours?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your mother is super weird.", "NTA  ... But so it's been said; here's the thing about paying \"rent\" in a parents home.... Landlords make the rules; tenants agree to the rules in lieu of paying rent. As an informal agreement that's not in writing; your mom can make whatever rules she wants whether you pay rent or not a it's her house. You're not wrong tho; your mom is out of line in more then one way", "NTA\n\nYour 22, an adult. Your grandparents will need the heads up about mum wanting to stay there so they (will) can specify who can stay there", "Info : you understand that what you call normal from your mom is abuse in any other reddit post right ?", "NTA Screw her", "NTA. Change your number.", "NTA.  \nIf your grandparents wanted her to have a key, they'd have given her one six years ago. At no time in those six years did they give her a key. That's telling.   \nThey could easily give her a key, now. They don't. Your mother does not get to dictate rules to you over access to someone else's home. That key was given to you in confidence. It's not for you to decide who gets to use that home. It's not your home, either.", "True, but the grandparents aren\u2019t doing their job. OP is definitely not TA. Mom has been TA for a while. Grandparents kinda are too", " \nText her all the reasons why you're not there", "This!! Why aren\u2019t they telling their daughter no? They\u2019re letting their grandchild (who they know already takes shit from their mother) deal with it. Mom is TA. Grandparents are kinda TA. OP is not."]}
