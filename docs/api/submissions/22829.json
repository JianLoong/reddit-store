Our breakup was amicable (I never assumed it would last given the age difference) I got along well with his family, even with his mother who (understandably) wasn\u2019t a fan of our relationship given the age gap, but did like me as a person. \n\nBefore our breakup, we were invited to a destination wedding of his cousin in Hawaii. I was asked to make the arrangements for flights and hotel. I didn\u2019t mind, so we made the arrangements together, selecting the place and flight times and I put it all on my credit card with the promise that they would pay back their portions when they could. (Over $2k each) I have a good job and could pay off the whole trip and I was happy to do it to save them interest on a credit card. \n\nSince then we broke up. \n\nRecently I got an email from his mother asking for her flight and hotel information. I politely reminded her that they would need to pay back their portion (it has been 3 months since we booked the trip) and asked if they would reimburse me for my portion of the hotel/Airbnb since we broke up and I wouldn\u2019t be attending. At first her response was cool, but polite saying that I would get my money eventually. I didn\u2019t respond. She wrote back again with a much different tone demanding the information for the hotel/Airbnb and I said I was causing undo stress while they were planning for this big trip. I replied that I would happily share that information once I was reimbursed. She said that I would not be reimbursed for my portion of the accommodation expenses and that she was going to tell everyone how terrible I was for holding the hotel information hostage. \n\nI texted my ex and asked what was happening and why things had taken such a turn. He said I was being unreasonable and making everything about money which was unfair since I knew they were struggling financially and I wasn\u2019t. I said that it didn\u2019t feel very fair to me that I was basically paying for them to go on this trip and getting nothing. He assured me that they would work on paying me back when things got better for them financially. I said that just wouldn\u2019t work for me since I had no guarantee and no idea how long that would be and that I would still be out thousands of dollars since they didn\u2019t want to reimburse me for my portion. \n\nI offered instead to let them share one room at the Airbnb and one room at the hotel but that I would be staying in one room as well. He was outraged and said I was making things weird, but my side is that I have the time off from work and paid for it so why shouldn\u2019t I go? \n\nI told him that I\u2019m still within the range to cancel the reservations if that was a better fit which he also didn\u2019t like since prices are much higher and places are harder to find now. I won\u2019t attend the wedding of course, but I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t take the vacation that I planned and paid for.

You did not agree to pay their way and they have not agreed to pay you back nor given you any reason to  think they ever will.

It was kind of you to front their expenses but this is not your problem any more - cut them loose.\n\n Let them say whatever they want. You're not involved in their lives any further.  You broke up and their threats are indefensible. If they want to look lke greedy ingrates, let them.

Our breakup was amicable (I never assumed it would last given the age difference) I got along well with his family, even with his mother who (understandably) wasn\u2019t a fan of our relationship given the age gap, but did like me as a person. Before our breakup, we were invited to a destination wedding of his cousin in Hawaii. I was asked to make the arrangements for flights and hotel. I didn\u2019t mind, so we made the arrangements together, selecting the place and flight times and I put it all on my credit card with the promise that they would pay back their portions when they could. (Over $2k each) I have a good job and could pay off the whole trip and I was happy to do it to save them interest on a credit card. Since then we broke up. Recently I got an email from his mother asking for her flight and hotel information. I politely reminded her that they would need to pay back their portion (it has been 3 months since we booked the trip) and asked if they would reimburse me for my portion of the hotel/Airbnb since we broke up and I wouldn\u2019t be attending. At first her response was cool, but polite saying that I would get my money eventually. I didn\u2019t respond. She wrote back again with a much different tone demanding the information for the hotel/Airbnb and I said I was causing undo stress while they were planning for this big trip. I replied that I would happily share that information once I was reimbursed. She said that I would not be reimbursed for my portion of the accommodation expenses and that she was going to tell everyone how terrible I was for holding the hotel information hostage. I texted my ex and asked what was happening and why things had taken such a turn. He said I was being unreasonable and making everything about money which was unfair since I knew they were struggling financially and I wasn\u2019t. I said that it didn\u2019t feel very fair to me that I was basically paying for them to go on this trip and getting nothing. He assured me that they would work on paying me back when things got better for them financially. I said that just wouldn\u2019t work for me since I had no guarantee and no idea how long that would be and that I would still be out thousands of dollars since they didn\u2019t want to reimburse me for my portion. I offered instead to let them share one room at the Airbnb and one room at the hotel but that I would be staying in one room as well. He was outraged and said I was making things weird, but my side is that I have the time off from work and paid for it so why shouldn\u2019t I go? I told him that I\u2019m still within the range to cancel the reservations if that was a better fit which he also didn\u2019t like since prices are much higher and places are harder to find now. I won\u2019t attend the wedding of course, but I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t take the vacation that I planned and paid for.

A trip is a luxury and if they can't afford one, it's not up to you to fund it, especially after breaking up. If they damage anything, even unintentionally, you'll be the person held responsible. Cancel their portion & let them figure it out for themselves. You are being far too sweet & unfortunately, it probably won't turn out well for you if you let them go while any part is in your name.", "Please make sure they pay absolutely everything up front before the last date to cancel. If they\u2019re this huffy about even setting a concrete date by which you will be repaid, in full\u2026they\u2019re not planning to pay you. \n\nMaybe, in their minds, they think they\u2019re good people so of course they\u2019ll repay you\u2026but they\u2019re not going to repay you. Or they would have already.", "They aren\u2019t going to pay you back. Cancel their flights and downsize your accomodation and go and have a fantastic holiday on your own. NTA", "You are Not their ATM or Bank for loans! Cancel , all, of you don\u2019t lost money an book a Other Hotel and have fun on Your vacation!", "Cancel or gift them the trip.  Consider it a bonus if they pay you back, but expect they won\u2019t.", "Do you need any more daughters??\ud83d\ude02", "That is shit advice for her to be out all the money since they haven't paid a dime of their portion.", "They're taking about the ex's family.", "Yeah, I think she should just cancel the extras at this point. There have been multiple texts and phone calls regarding the matter, OP has been clear about requiring payment, and the ex and his fam insist on \"paying\" via empty promises and demands rather than cash.\n\nThey don't intend to pay and even if they finally did, why should she ruin her vacation with having to be around these people and the anger they'd have for her?", "Very good point. If it's on the OP's credit card, guess whose card would be charged if there were any damages?", "I'm with you, I wouldn't give them the chance.  If they had been reasonable and polite and reimbursed me up front, then I would have let them have the trip.  After this, though, I wouldn't trust them with anything that had my name or credit attached to it.  \n\n\nIt is a strong possibility that they may try to \"get their money's worth\" or \"teach OP a lesson\" by trashing the room or stealing from the accommodations, for which OP would be legally responsible for as being the one who booked the room.  I read a story once about this person who rented a hotel room for a homeless girl to stay in (by themselves) for the night.  The homeless girl proceeded to barricade herself in the room and completely destroy it.  Clearly she had mental problems.  The person who rented the room for her was held responsible for the damages.", "I only have the one so far! But she'll bring home a nice girl someday.", "No, you are not wrong. Reading the post and that person's original comment shows very poor reading comprehension. It took them a very long time to realize that it was not a \"2k\" loss but a 7k loss because not a single penny has been paid to OP and the ex and his mom have been clear that they have no intention to pay a cent until after the trip and they want OP to rely on their empty promises to make those payments beginning when they feel like it, at their leisure, at an unspecified intervals, until who knows when. Dude is delusional. \n\nThe trip is in two weeks and they haven't made any attempts to even start to pay in the three months since they booked it. They should have reached out and come to a solution well before that point, but they clearly have chosen not to because they're trying to get a free trip at this point. She should just cancel the trip at this point and get what money she can back.", "I certainly wouldn't put myself in their presence. They already seem shifty.\n\nWho goes to a destination wedding when they \"are struggling financially?\" Not someone that's good at paying back their debts. \n\nNTA - OP see your way out of this mess,", "I might have to check this group out! 36F and going through some weird breakups after my husband and best friend got caught having an affair that lasted a year before I found out! So weird/shitty/sad to lose your romantic partner of 9 years and BFF of 7 at the same time\u2026 hawaii sounds soooooo good \ud83d\ude02", "I read your comment and I was like, \u201cWTF is she giving her bra size for and why would OP pick her to travel with based on it\u201d? I did just read a post about breast reductions, so sizes were being announced all over the place! \ud83d\ude02"]}
