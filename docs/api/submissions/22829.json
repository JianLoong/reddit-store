{"id": 22829, "submission_id": "155ycgy", "title": "AITA for insisting on going on the family vacation of my ex boyfriend?", "selftext": "My (34f) and ex boyfriend (25m) were together for a year and a half. Our breakup was amicable (I never assumed it would last given the age difference) I got along well with his family, even with his mother who (understandably) wasn\u2019t a fan of our relationship given the age gap, but did like me as a person. \n\nBefore our breakup, we were invited to a destination wedding of his cousin in Hawaii. I was asked to make the arrangements for flights and hotel. I didn\u2019t mind, so we made the arrangements together, selecting the place and flight times and I put it all on my credit card with the promise that they would pay back their portions when they could. (Over $2k each) I have a good job and could pay off the whole trip and I was happy to do it to save them interest on a credit card. \n\nSince then we broke up. \n\nRecently I got an email from his mother asking for her flight and hotel information. I politely reminded her that they would need to pay back their portion (it has been 3 months since we booked the trip) and asked if they would reimburse me for my portion of the hotel/Airbnb since we broke up and I wouldn\u2019t be attending. At first her response was cool, but polite saying that I would get my money eventually. I didn\u2019t respond. She wrote back again with a much different tone demanding the information for the hotel/Airbnb and I said I was causing undo stress while they were planning for this big trip. I replied that I would happily share that information once I was reimbursed. She said that I would not be reimbursed for my portion of the accommodation expenses and that she was going to tell everyone how terrible I was for holding the hotel information hostage. \n\nI texted my ex and asked what was happening and why things had taken such a turn. He said I was being unreasonable and making everything about money which was unfair since I knew they were struggling financially and I wasn\u2019t. I said that it didn\u2019t feel very fair to me that I was basically paying for them to go on this trip and getting nothing. He assured me that they would work on paying me back when things got better for them financially. I said that just wouldn\u2019t work for me since I had no guarantee and no idea how long that would be and that I would still be out thousands of dollars since they didn\u2019t want to reimburse me for my portion. \n\nI offered instead to let them share one room at the Airbnb and one room at the hotel but that I would be staying in one room as well. He was outraged and said I was making things weird, but my side is that I have the time off from work and paid for it so why shouldn\u2019t I go? \n\nI told him that I\u2019m still within the range to cancel the reservations if that was a better fit which he also didn\u2019t like since prices are much higher and places are harder to find now. I won\u2019t attend the wedding of course, but I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t take the vacation that I planned and paid for.

They are assholes for assuming you'll be paying.", "OH BOY. NTA-  \n\n\nIs there a possibility of changing the reservation to one of their cards? Would the hotels, etc be willing to swap the charge?

I realize it sucks that they really want to go but it's not really your problem anymore.

You did not agree to pay their way and they have not agreed to pay you back nor given you any reason to  think they ever will.

It was kind of you to front their expenses but this is not your problem any more - cut them loose.\n\n Let them say whatever they want. You're not involved in their lives any further.  You broke up and their threats are indefensible. If they want to look lke greedy ingrates, let them.

Our breakup was amicable (I never assumed it would last given the age difference) I got along well with his family, even with his mother who (understandably) wasn\u2019t a fan of our relationship given the age gap, but did like me as a person. Before our breakup, we were invited to a destination wedding of his cousin in Hawaii. I was asked to make the arrangements for flights and hotel. I didn\u2019t mind, so we made the arrangements together, selecting the place and flight times and I put it all on my credit card with the promise that they would pay back their portions when they could. (Over $2k each) I have a good job and could pay off the whole trip and I was happy to do it to save them interest on a credit card. Since then we broke up. Recently I got an email from his mother asking for her flight and hotel information. I politely reminded her that they would need to pay back their portion (it has been 3 months since we booked the trip) and asked if they would reimburse me for my portion of the hotel/Airbnb since we broke up and I wouldn\u2019t be attending. At first her response was cool, but polite saying that I would get my money eventually. I didn\u2019t respond. She wrote back again with a much different tone demanding the information for the hotel/Airbnb and I said I was causing undo stress while they were planning for this big trip. I replied that I would happily share that information once I was reimbursed. She said that I would not be reimbursed for my portion of the accommodation expenses and that she was going to tell everyone how terrible I was for holding the hotel information hostage. I texted my ex and asked what was happening and why things had taken such a turn. He said I was being unreasonable and making everything about money which was unfair since I knew they were struggling financially and I wasn\u2019t. I said that it didn\u2019t feel very fair to me that I was basically paying for them to go on this trip and getting nothing. He assured me that they would work on paying me back when things got better for them financially. I said that just wouldn\u2019t work for me since I had no guarantee and no idea how long that would be and that I would still be out thousands of dollars since they didn\u2019t want to reimburse me for my portion. I offered instead to let them share one room at the Airbnb and one room at the hotel but that I would be staying in one room as well. He was outraged and said I was making things weird, but my side is that I have the time off from work and paid for it so why shouldn\u2019t I go? I told him that I\u2019m still within the range to cancel the reservations if that was a better fit which he also didn\u2019t like since prices are much higher and places are harder to find now. I won\u2019t attend the wedding of course, but I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t take the vacation that I planned and paid for.

And hold those airline credit vouchers hostage until they pay you for them.", "Use paragraphs my girl. Then I will judge.", "NTA but I don\u2019t they will ever pay you back. They want a free trip and it\u2019s not worth the hassle of having them sign anything as it will cost you more to sue them when they don\u2019t pay. It likely is too much for a small claims court type thing as well. Just cancel their tickets and reservations and go by yourself or with good friends.", "NTA", "NTA.  They have no intention of paying you back is my guess.  Honestly, at this point I would just cancel their reservations, recoup what you can and if you still want to go on the trip by yourself (or with someone else), go for it.  Dont wedding crash though.  Also, if they are going through financial trouble and cant afford this trip.....why are they going on this trip?", "NTA, give them a deadline and if money doesn't come in just cancel", "NTA but I wouldn't go, I would simply cancel, get my money back, block them, and let them figure it out.

It feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity and I\u2019d love to still go! Maybe even meet someone there hahaha!", "If I were you, I'd go on the vacay and explain they can either pay you to not go (including your portion) or decide if they need to leave someone behind (so you're able to enjoy your paid-for room).", "This. OP just cancel everything. If they want to attend they can book it themselves. You owe them nothing.\n\nIt's a dumb idea to also go and use half the space. You would have to deal with constant drama und would not get your money back anyway.", "AND! Why waste your vacation time with people who clearly don't like you?\nHard expectation for full payment or cancellation (2-4 wks prior to wedding, IMO).\nYou're definitely NTA.", "This is the way. \n\nEdit: NTA", "That\u2019s a great idea!

Two bedrooms in each. So if I cancel, it would be the whole thing which would leave them scrambling. But they haven\u2019t paid back any of their share which we were originally splitting three ways. I think it would be weird too but I\u2019d really just be sleeping and showering there in my own room if they were willing to share the other. It\u2019s not ideal, but I just felt like I should get something out of it since it\u2019s all been paid for by me.", "I\u2019m not close to the bride or groom, but I wouldn\u2019t be attending the wedding.

But I will give them another chance to pay.", "I\u2019m looking to be reimbursed for the entire hotel/Airbnb since it\u2019s a two bedroom house and a two bedroom suite. It would be the same price whether I went or not so I don\u2019t see why it should be a three way split since I\u2019m no longer welcome.

You made the plans 3 months ago, and within that time frame you broke up. You\u2019re not entitled to other people reimbursing you because your relationship fell apart. You made plans, then *your* circumstances changed and you no longer can/want to attend: that is your problem, not anyone else\u2019s. Also, people don\u2019t go from seventh heaven to breaking up overnight. When *you* decided to attend the wedding and make these arrangements you knew your relationship was not in good standing. You chose to ignore this because you wanted to go to Hawaii. YTA for that alone.\n\nWhen you broke up, instead of being an adult and discussing what arrangements or changes could be made, you deliberately chose to ignore the situation. The thing is, since no further discussion was made, it is logical for people to assume that they still had their tickets and reservations, especially from his mom\u2019s side who has no business in your relationship. You decided long ago that you would not honor the reservation and you never communicated it to them, using your financial situation (and their unfortunate situation) to control and hurt them.

Asking them to pay within a day\u2019s notice is unreasonable and you are being a controlling asshole. Asking them to pay you within the week is acceptable, however given how you mentioned they would normally put this expense on a credit card, it might not be feasible for them to come up with 4k in cash. You are unreasonable in asking them, especially his mom, to reimburse you. You and your boyfriend should have discussed what would happen with the reservation long ago, when they could still rebook things or make other arrangements. You could argue that your ex is also an asshole for ignoring the situation, but you most definitely are a huge asshole. YTA.", "You seem like a nice person. I haven't read it yet but I'll assume NTA.

There weren\u2019t any hard feelings prior to this so it\u2019s kind of out of left field and I\u2019m struggling with feeling like an asshole no matter what move I make. I\u2019m an asshole if I go, I\u2019m an asshole if I don\u2019t go and pay for it, I\u2019m an asshole if I cancel it and leave them scrambling.", "I have until before 48 hours to cancel the Airbnb and 24 for the hotel so they have almost two full weeks.

If they don\u2019t they will blame you but it\u2019s neither your doing nor fault. Cancel them now and give them the best chance to sleep on someone else\u2019s floor. This isn\u2019t on you.

You are not entitled to reimbursement for your actions, and most definitely not by his mom.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying you should pay for their parts: they should most definitely pay you back 4k, and if they don\u2019t you are not an asshole.

As I said, you could ask your ex to split the cost of your part, and I think it would be nice of him to agree to that.\n\nAny other scenario is asshole territory in my book. Option A, you cancel their booking/use it for yourself: you\u2019re an asshole because they might not be able to attend the wedding at all, or it might cost them twice the amount. Option B, you join trip but obviously skip the wedding: I think you might still be an asshole, but I\u2019m not dead set on that. While it definitely is awkward, since there are two rooms they could reasonably give you one and you could pay for seat selection so you\u2019re not seated with them on the plane. Maybe this is actually the least worst solution out of all, since you don\u2019t lose any money, and they can attend the wedding as planned.

B seemed the most reasonable since then even if they never pay me back a dime at least I got a trip out of it.", "I think we\u2019re on the same page.

There was a contract of repayment. Check what Small Claims limits are in your state. No lawyer is going to write a payment plan without a court order. \n\nI'd, personally, stick to your plan of giving them until the day before the last day to cancel and cancel.", "I agree with you, I would make sure you get the money back. I don\u2019t know your relationship with them and I have never dealt with a lawyer personally. I would try to avoid procuring one, but it\u2019s a large sum to just sit around and hope that they will pay you back.

I apologize for getting carried away, you are being genuinely interested in a resolution and it is commendable.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying the ex sucks as well. I\u2019m not sure how long ago they broke up, which might affect things (i.e., if they broke up last week, then ex and his mom might have thought they had months to pay her back, since they were in a relationship).", "Yeah, that sounds like a plan! But I would not take a 7k loss lol that\u2019s absurd, make sure you get the 4k back!!!", "Oh hell no to 7k.

Yeah, I agree although I think it would be weird for her to stay in the same place. I hope she can still go on the trip and stay somewhere else. And yeah, take the loss of her 1/3 of the rooms!", "That\u2019s good advice too. The idea of taking them to court feels so bad too! I\u2019d rather just work something out reasonably. I\u2019m going to contact a lawyer on Monday and see what my options are. Thank you!!", "You've already been reasonable. That option was used and discarded by the ex and his mom.
