I love my niece very, very much but Marnie sets down no boundaries for her. Everything Annabelle does is age appropriate but as a parent, it\u2019s your job to help your child become the best person they can be.\n\nWhen Annabelle doesn\u2019t want to do something or needs to get her way, she screams. It\u2019s very, very loud and hard to ignore. Marnie and her husband instantly give in. As a mom of 4, I completely understand it\u2019s hard to hear your child cry or be upset. And sometimes, yes, absolutely pick your battles. But others, the toddler can\u2019t win.\n\nAround the holidays, Marnie and I hung out a lot with the kids. At one point, we were headed to an aquarium. Marnie started going one way and Annabelle started screaming. Marnie turns around and heads in a direction that\u2019ll add 15 minutes to our route.  When I asked why, she said that Annabelle likes passing a certain landmark on her way. However, Annabelle then started screaming she *didn\u2019t* want to see it and halfway there, we turned around. It added more time and my kids were annoyed.\n\nI let most of this go as Annabelle is not my child, it isn\u2019t my vehicle or house where these predicaments take place. \n\nBut then Marnie broke her leg while her husband was out of town. She needed help getting around and tending to Annabelle. I agreed they should stay with us. \n\nLast night, we pick up our kids from school, stopping at Annabelle\u2019s preschool last. Once we finally get her in the car (she didn\u2019t want to leave and Marnie let her just run around for 10 minutes, wouldn\u2019t let me grab her because \u201cshe\u2019s the boss of her body\u201d) I\u2019m exhausted. I still have to get home and cook. \n\nAs I\u2019m heading in one direction, Annabelle starts screaming for me to go in the other. I calmly explain that way is longer and we don\u2019t have the time. Marnie asks me to just make it easier, she doesn\u2019t want to hear her scream. Going that way will add more time to our drive. I say no again and keep driving, putting on some kid friendly music. My kids are trying to distract Annabelle. \n\nMarnie starts crying, saying things like \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby! We\u2019ll be home soon! Oh, I know you\u2019re so sad! This isn\u2019t very nice\u201d. The thing is, Annabelle stopped screaming (keep in mind, she never shed a tear, just screamed) after 5 minutes when she realized she wasn\u2019t getting her way.\n\nMarnie later told me that I was horrible for forcing her to listen to her daughter scream. Would it have been so hard to not add stress to her?\n\nMy husband agrees that I did the right thing but also pointed out Marnie and Annabella are going through a stressful time.

You get to choose the route home.", "Holy God your sister and her husband are HUGE AHs. The level of entitlement your sister has as you\u2019re caring for her kid and HER. Fuck that noise (pun intended). I\u2019d let her navigate the broken leg and screaming toddler on her own. \n\nYou have 4 kids of your own, thats harder than dealing with one kid and a broken leg.

Annabelle will be better for it in the long run and maybe Marnie can learn too.", "NTA. It's clear your sister is a huge problem here. She has established early on that Annabelle is in charge and she is content to take the path of least resistance. The problem is children NEED rules and, in an effort to avoid having to actually parent,your sister is setting her daughter up for future failure. We can love our kids and empathize (no one wants to hear their kid scream and dealing with tantrums is exhausting) but you generally act calm and correct irrational behavior bc that's your JOB as a parent. I expect to see your sister on an ep of Supernanny wondering ' 'where we went wrong ?'", "NTA. It sounds like Marnie is the bigger problem here. She cried because you didn't cave to her daughters wishes. She needs therapy. \n\nYou don't have to let a child order you around just because he mother lets her be the boss of her.", "NTA. Your sister is going to have a hell of a time when Annabelle is a teen. She better reign in that shit now.", "NTA.  Your house, your car, your rules.  Kids know there are rules for home, rules for school, rules for church, rules for grandma\u2019s (you get it). These are important lessons and your niece is perfectly old enough to navigate these different environments.  It WAS inappropriate for your sister to tell her daughter you weren\u2019t \u201cvery nice\u201d rather than telling her Aunt You is in charge of her car when driving.  I hope your sister gets a grip on the situation soon.", "NTA. Holy crap. \"I know you're sad, this isn't very nice.\" Your sister just enabled her daughter by saying that you weren't nice by not going to Marnie's preferred direction. \n\nI would suggest telling her that when it comes to at least the direction you steer the car in, she doesn't talk to her daughter about it because she's making it worse! And tell her as long as she's staying with you, it stops at all times!", "I have a 3 year old that's a screamer.  She's a lot better than she used to be because I don't negotiate with ear terrorists.  \n\nYou don't have to eat dinner kid but no candy.

They just give in because they dont want to hear her scream. That is why she will get her way. This is learned behavior. She knows how to manipulate her parents. For personal gain and sympathy.", "NTA. Sounds like Marnie thinks catering to her spoiled kid makes her a good Mom. Sad emotionally unhealthy situation.", "NTA completely agree we all need to pick our battles with this stuff but you can't constantly cave in. It's fucking painful but not caving is the right thing to do. They are bringing up a child that will always expect her own way and that's not just preparing her for life. She needs someone in her life who will not let her get away with it and apparently that's you.

Child screams to get her way for no reason other than to get her way, and you didn't give it to her.\n\nYour sister should've been *supporting* your decision and explaining to the child that we (as people) can't always have our own way. If she couldn't manage that, she could've at least been silent on the subject... I mean, I don't like telling parents how to parent, but I also really hate backseat driving, especially when it's in screaming child form.", "NTA. Your sister might not mind raising her kid to be a brat but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to indulge her.", "[removed]", "NTA", "NTA I think you drew a boundary at a very reasonable time.

You should have asked her why her child\u2019s desire trump you children\u2019s. Or what she is going to do when her daughter is 25 years old and can\u2019t support herself because of her behavior makes it impossible to keep a job?\n\nThe \u201cstressful\u201d time is a cop out. Sounds like there is never a good time and they just had more kids than they could emotionally handle.", "NTA. Aside from the occasional joyride or Sunday drive, who tf let's their kid dictate their drive path. SMH", "NTA: holy bananas Marine needs to read some John Rosemond books and learn to set healthy boundaries, expectations etc. \nThis kid sounds like she is going to make life hell for everyone else just because mom cannot handle her kid upset at all. \nSerious wtf? Kids get upset. You tell them no. They cope.", "Shes gunna regret that shit", "NTA\n\nI do agree it's easy for non- and other parents to underestimate how aggravating screaming and crying can be, and how hard it can be on parents to just listen to it/muster through it or ignore it when needs be. I can't begrudge parents who do occasionally cave in just to get a screaming kid to shut up already.\n\nBut when it's only occasionally is one thing; doing so *constantly* is another. As others have pointed out, that teaches children that if they throw a tantrum, they'll get their way because everyone else around them just wants them to be quiet.\n\nThink about what we call it when teenagers or adults scream, yell, cry, or throw tantrums until the people around them cave into their demands. We have a word for teenagers who yell at classmates until they acquiesce to that kid's demands. We have a word for customers in a store who scream at service workers until they get their way. We have a word for people in an intimate relationship who use yelling to wear down their partner.\n\nYou need to let your sister know that if she doesn't stop acquiescing to the screaming, *those* are what her child will grow up to be. And if your sister is fine with that, then the next best thing you can do is evaluate your own children and whether this relationship with your sister is worth them being around such a bad influence.", "NTA. But your sister is for making everything about her daughter and letting her scream that way.", "NTA\n\nIf Marnie continues this route, her child will grow up to be a spoiled brat. Ask her what  she thinks she\u2019s teaching her daughter by rewarding her when she screams and cries?", "NTA. That is a demon child and your sister is raising a monster.", "NTA!\n\nIt was a hard lesson but your sister needed it!", "NTA in any way here. Perfectly reasonable thing to do from a parenting standpoint, and if Marnie has a problem with how you parent or run things, she doesn't have to ask for your help next time.", "NTA - if she doesn\u2019t like it, you can pack her up and send her home and she can deal with her daughter all by herself", "NTA", "Just how -and when- did we get to this point with kids and them running the show of life? So far I\u2019ve raised five 3-year-olds, so I consider myself an expert. Lol. All kids have to be taught and trained which includes boundaries and discipline.   \n  \n  \nCurrently, there is no reason for Annabelle to stop screaming. It\u2019s just how she *effectively* communicates what she wants. She gets her way each time. Marnie is doing her a great disservice.   \n  \n  \nYou are NTA.", "NTA I used to babysit a little boy who threw tantrums like that, my sister also babysat him on alternating days. My solution was when he started screaming I made sure he wasn\u2019t in danger and then sat where I could keep an eye on him and played on my phone or read my book (his mom was okay with both as she knew I still was paying attention to him) and after a while he realized I wasn\u2019t going to acknowledge the screaming or give in so he just stopped. He\u2019d want to go upstairs and I\u2019d say no we needed to stay downstairs because i was cooking lunch and he\u2019d accept it (note it was a reasonable request usually so id promise we could go upstairs later and then stuck to my word and we went up later) I would say \u201cokay I\u2019m Setting a timer when it goes off it\u2019s time to go in and drink some water\u201d and then when the timer went off we\u2019d go in, no fuss. I\u2019d say he couldn\u2019t have xyz (that\u2019s as dangerous for him) and he\u2019d accept that, sometimes he\u2019d ask why and I\u2019d explain but he stopped throwing tantrums for me. HOWEVER my sisters approach was just to give in, he wanted to go upstairs and she said no because she was cooking? He\u2019d scream until she turned the stove off and paused lunch to go upstairs. It was time to go inside so he didn\u2019t get heat stroke or sunburn (we live in texas so heat is a major problem especially with little kids)? He\u2019s scream until she gave in and they stayed outside. He knew she\u2019d give in so he kept doing it, but he knew I wouldn\u2019t and so he didn\u2019t. A funny thing from that is at first he hated me because I made him follow rules\u2026after a few months he decided I was his favorite BECAUSE I made him follow the rules and we stuck to the agreed on schedule. He also napped for me for at least a month after he stopped napping for my sister and even his mom, I guess my reliably and schedule worked really well for him but maybe I just lucked out. Either way, kids needs to be told no, your sister might think she\u2019s making her daughter happier by giving in to her every demand but children do best when they have reasonable rules.", "NTA how do you even spend time around these people", "No,I\u2019m a single mom of 7 and I realize you did the right thing and probably could break this behavior before the husband get back. I would not have turned around either but \u2026if you step in between her parenting her child you would be. You don\u2019t have to be bossed around by a 3 year old but if your sister wants to be,you can put in your opinion  but then you\u2019ll have to back away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
