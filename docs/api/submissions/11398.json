For a multitude of reasons we haven't done a trip since 2018.  I am married and we have an 18 month old.  My sister has a boyfriend, and my brother has some sort of terrier and no GF I know of.\n\nMy brother has morphed into a self described \"dog dad\" and based off social media seems to rarely do things without the dog.  We live in the same city, but different areas and we don't see him all that much.  The few times i've been around his dog it behaves fine.  Its too friendly for me and I can't speak to how it behaves over multiple days or around babies.\n\nMy parents have a Vrbo beach house in Florida booked.  In a few week the deadline for a full refund for canceling is coming up and my parents need to know if we are in.  We live in the west side of the USA so we'd be flying.  I found out my brother plans to bring his dog.  My parents aren't thrilled about it but \"it is what it is\", those are my parents words.\n\nI'm not a dog person, I despise them on airplanes.  I do not want to travel with the dog (tentatively we are on the same flight), I do not want to stay the week in the same house as the dog, I do not want activities based on being dog friendly, and I do not want the dog around my son.\n\nOur parents want to stay out of it and have us hash it out.  I broached the topic with my brother.  Essentially he isn't flexible on the dog, it is his family and it is a family vacation.  He says my 18 month old will be far more annoying and loud than his dog.  He seems firm on this and i'm ready to pull out of the trip.  If I don't go, the trip may fall apart.

You would be the AH if you asked your brother not to come because you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with his dog. \n\nYour brother is unwilling to go somewhere without his dog, and he has effectively chosen bringing his dog over having you there.

But that\u2019s your brother\u2019s choice. \n\nTwo - the comment about the kid was unnecessary. If he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with your kid, he should say so. \n\nThree - Dogs are unpredictable around small children, and where you don\u2019t know it\u2019s history I would be concerned about it being around your kid too. \n\nFinally - your folks are going to be on the hook for upholding the rules of the property, so they should care. You could be asked to leave and fined if they don\u2019t allow animals, and a dog is way more likely to do serious damage than a toddler. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t want to go when you would be spending that much time and energy traveling with a little one, but that\u2019s just me.", "NAH because you have a right not to go on the trip for whatever reason.

What is more important to you?  Having a relationship with your brother, or avoiding dogs?  It sounds like spending time with your brother the dog is coming too, like it or not.  And if he has to choose between you and the dog he will choose the dog", "Sorry, YTA. Your brother will be taking care of the dog, not you. Your brother will be feeding the dog, not you. Your brother will be taking the dog out to the bathroom, not you. It's a terrier dog, so it's not like it is big dog. I am willing to bet if it is going on an airplane with your brother he has SOME sort of training in place for the dog. This dog is like family to him, and for some people (I am NOT one of those people but) for some people their dogs ARE their kids. You don't have to do everything with the dog either. I am sure your brother will bring a kennel too. But he does have a point. Would you leave YOUR child behind? For some people, their dogs bring them peace and comfort. Also, if you do end up going don't be the asshole and encourage your 18 month old to terrorize the dog. Use this as an opportunity to teach your baby how to start interacting with a dog, because you might end up owning one or four one day.", "Does the beach house allow dogs? If not then no problem for you. If yes then maybe you should accept the dog as part of the family and allow your child to get to know and learn how to interact with the dog.

You can bring babies lots of places you can\u2019t bring a dog (beach, restaurant, stores, museums, sight seeing spots, ect\u2026 and the dog will require a lot more schedule adjusting than your kid.\n\nOverall, bringing a dog on vacation when you have to fly is a little silly and obsessive.\n\nThe bigger issue here is this could drive a wedge between you and your brother and small dogs have long life spans (some 20+ years) so this could be a long divide.", "NTA. You definitely shouldn't go you sound like you'll ruin the trip for everyone.", "NTA, if you won\u2019t be comfortable then why leave your comfort zone.", "INFO: If your brother didn't like babies, would you leave yours behind for a week with a sitter to appease him?", "NTA. \n\nYour parents don't want to be involved, fine. \n\nYour brother is firm on bringing the dog, fine. \n\nYou don't want to vacation with a dog, fine. \n\nYou can pull out of the vacation, the end. My guess- and clearly yours- is that suddenly your parents WILL get involved and be upset at you once you pull out of the trip, but oh well. You don't want to deal with the dog on vacation and I can appreciate that, and if your brother isn't willing to compromise and no one else will weigh in, you pull out of the trip. \n\nBy the way, I would have a dog before I had a kid (I just don't have one because I live in an NYC apartment and travel a lot for work), and would rather vacation with a dog than a kid. I still agree with you and your approach AND dogs are not as important as human children.", "YTA\n\nThis is such a weird nitpick to have. You're the only one with a problem.\n\nGo, don't go, who cares. I guess your family isn't that important to you if someone else's well-behaved dog makes you feel this way.", " NTA\n\nI love dogs, have 2, but fuck the dogs going on holidays!\n\nI hate it when catching up with friends and they refer to dog things using their dogs names like they're their kids.

Put your foot down now and refuse to go or else EVERY trip will be catered to your brother and his dog fetish.", "My question is how is he getting the dog on the interior of a cross country flight. At the least he might need medical or psychiatric documentation.  I was just looking at United for my real trained service dog.  At the minimum it is also the start of spring break in Florida check out the area to see if it is party central.  I don\u2019t take my service dog on hot sand or asphalt because of burns and debris.  \n\nAs for your toddler, my girl was a born traveler.  Have a bottle for take off and landings, as they have ear pressure problems.  With RSV and now this measle exposure in the south, I am not sure I would take my toddler.", "Does the rental even allow pets? Is your brother on the hook for any damage the dog causes in the rental or is it on your parents? Is the cleaning deposit higher because of the dog? I understand where you\u2019re coming from.  I\u2019m not a dog person either and neither are my kids (daughter is allergic). Honestly I\u2019d let it be.  Go on the trip but firmly ask that the dog stay out of your room & your child\u2019s room (if separate).  Keep the door closed. Tell brother he\u2019s 100% responsible for dog.  Request parents when babysitting that the dog needs to stay away from your child. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a hard ask.   If you\u2019re willing to compromise on activities regarding your child staying behind with you and/or wife then he should be willing to do the same.  It\u2019s only fair.  \n\nI don\u2019t think YTA in this.  Just a concerned parent and traveler.  A family discussion just needs to be made and your parents need to step in especially if they\u2019re paying.  If it\u2019s a shared cost then you need to reiterate that any damage cause by his dog is on him only just like any damage caused by your child would be on you.", "YTA as you seem to be solely focused on your wants whereas you\u2019d have zero responsibly for the dog so I really shouldn\u2019t be something you\u2019re hyper focused on. And as someone who is around both dogs and babies on a very regular basis, he is right that your toddler will be 10x as loud and annoying as the dog.", "Info: does the place allow dogs? Some rentals don't allow them", "People with kids are so damn entitled. An 18 month year old is way more of an annoyance and nuisance for a family vacation than a well behaved terrier.", "NTA but it's also fair if your brother wants to bring his dog anyway. Maybe you can just get a different flight (though there might be a dog there too) or a different place to stay in. I don't think people are obligated to be comfortable to live with an animal if they didn't consent to it even if its just for a vacation.", "YTA your brother is right that a 18month old is way louder and more disruptive than a small well behaved dog. Plus you don't want activities being defined by the dog? Dogs can be left alone for a few hours when everyone goes to an activity or restaurant, while a baby can't. So I'm assuming all the activities and restaurants will be limited by what is baby friendly no? I'd rather be on a plane or vacation with a dog  any day. Your whole attitude around it is just so extreme and over the top, I think it's best for you to pull out so everyone else can have a nice vacation.", "NAH. \n>\nBut your brother is correct about a toddler being more \u201cannoying\u201d than a well behaved dog. \n>\nQ: Why don\u2019t you want your toddler around a dog?", "YTA. A small dog that behaves \u201cfine\u201d is going to be easier to deal with than an 18 month old. You don\u2019t want activities to be based on being dog friendly, but are you expecting all the adults to put up with the activities all having to be child friendly?\n\nI doubt the trip will fall apart because your entitled ass pulls out.", "You despise dogs. Pretty simple solution then. You\u2019re the one making demands so get your own lodgings nearby. That way, no one will be annoyed with the dog or young child. \n\nYou both sound like narrow minded insufferable assholes. From the info you provided, you more so than him.", "If you don\u2019t want to stay in a house with a dog, that doesn\u2019t automatically make you an AH\u2014just like your brother would be well within his rights to skip the trip if he didn\u2019t want to deal with a toddler. You\u2019re not telling him to skip the trip, you\u2019re saying it would make the trip uncomfortable for you. This sounds like a basic incompatibility. \n\nThat said, a well-behaved small dog is actually a really good way to introduce your toddler to animals, so I hope you reconsider. Your toddler WILL get curious about dogs sooner or later. Talk to your brother about making sure the dog doesn\u2019t jump on people and take the opportunity. \n\nFor the record, some people in these comments seem to have a really distorted view of what 18-month-olds are actually like. Toddlers shouldn\u2019t be crying overnight and keeping people up at this age. They don\u2019t need complete quiet to sleep, and do very well with white noise machines\u2014I\u2019ve had pretty loud and lively get togethers at my home when my baby has been in bed. And they aren\u2019t like colicky infants who are screaming for hours at a time.\n\nNAH I guess but y\u2019all need to work on your communication as a family.", "YTA - if his dog is dangerous, then you\u2019d be in the right, but you are the only one with a problem about it.  Dogs generally can be left for hours at a time with no issue. You also don\u2019t need to tend to the dog, ask the brother would be responsible for it. You are being needlessly difficult for no reason.\n\nIf you are concerned about the dog around your son. Arrange a meet and greet ahead of time to aclimate them. You live nearby.", "Weird that you\u2019re THAT dog averse. Children building healthy relationships with animals is very good for them. \n\nThat being said\u2026. I totally get it. I literally work with animals, and our last trip back to visit my in laws was hijacked by a fucking terror of a golden doodle. This god damn dog and my god damn in laws were such a pain in the ass all week. We couldn\u2019t do anything because they refused to leave the dog. The dog was also barking at and chasing all the kids, it was mayhem. It ruined our vacation that we traveled cross country for. I love animals, but it\u2019s ok to not impose them on everyone during a vacation. \n\nIf your brothers dog is well behaved it seems kinda odd to make it a deal breaker. Our parents are only here for so long, and your child deserves to make these types of memories with them. \nWhy not give it a shot, take one for the team and if it sucks tell them you will not be doing that again.", "YTA - and his statement \"He says my 18 month old will be far more annoying and loud than his dog.\" Is ABSOLUTELY true. \n\nPerhaps an unpopular opinion, but 'family' isn't defined solely by squirting out an infant or having shared the same space pre-birth. He has told you that his dog is a non-negotiable, and I assume that your toddler is a non-negotiable. You hate dogs, he might hate kids. Neither is more or less valid. \n\nYour ideas are not compatible - but I'm calling you the a-hole because you believe your position is superior rather than just different.", "NAH. This is not the holiday you want to do, then don\u2019t do it.", "NAH. Honestly it\u2019s not an asshole move to not go on the trip.

Your parents don't sound like they love it, but it's obviously not a hill they'd want to die on. I guess they'd rather see their son with his dog than not see him at all. Plus, it sounds like the dog is perfectly well behaved, based on your own story.\n\nI don't understand why you want to die on this hill so badly. It's entirely likely that your 18 month old will require WAY more maintenance and attention on this trip than a dog will, and your brother is not wrong for pointing this out. Incidentally, I have never once been bothered by an animal on a flight, but I can't step foot onto a god damned plane without some monstrous little human being screaming for the entire flight.\n\nThat doesn't mean dogs are better than humans, but if your argument is \"annoyance\", then I'm sorry, there's no way that a well trained and well behaved dog is more annoying than an 18 month old human that requires constant care.\n\nDie on the hill if you must, but understand it'll probably create some sour feelings with your family.

For a multitude of reasons we haven't done a trip since 2018.  I am married and we have an 18 month old.  My sister has a boyfriend, and my brother has some sort of terrier and no GF I know of.  \n\nMy brother has morphed into a self described \"dog dad\" and based off social media seems to rarely do things without the dog.  We live in the same city, but different areas and we don't see him all that much.  The few times i've been around his dog it behaves fine.  Its too friendly for me and I can't speak to how it behaves over multiple days or around babies.    \nMy parents have a Vrbo beach house in Florida booked.  In a few week the deadline for a full refund for canceling is coming up and my parents need to know if we are in.  We live in the west side of the USA so we'd be flying.  I found out my brother plans to bring his dog.  My parents aren't thrilled about it but \"it is what it is\", those are my parents words.    \nI'm not a dog person, I despise them on airplanes.  I do not want to travel with the dog (tentatively we are on the same flight), I do not want to stay the week in the same house as the dog, I do not want activities based on being dog friendly, and I do not want the dog around my son.    \nOur parents want to stay out of it and have us hash it out.  I broached the topic with my brother.  Essentially he isn't flexible on the dog, it is his family and it is a family vacation.  He says my 18 month old will be far more annoying and loud than his dog.  He seems firm on this and i'm ready to pull out of the trip.  If I don't go, the trip may fall apart.

It's fair to ask the dog is kept away from the baby. \n\nA baby is a far more inconvenience than a dog. You can leave a dog home alone for a few hours if people want to eat at a nice restaurant. It's rude to bring a baby to a nice restaurant, they have bed times and they scream at movies. Kids are awesome- but you're on a different planet if you think the vacation is going to revolve around the dog- it's going to revolve around your baby.", "NAH. You have a baby, he has a dog. Dogs can be annoying on planes, babies can be annoying on planes. You don't want to do dog friendly activities, others may not want to do baby friendly activities. If he wants to bring his dog, that's fine. Lots of people take dogs to beach vacations. If you don't want to go, that's your choice. But sounds like a shame for what appears to have been a nice family tradition", "NAH, you're allowed to dislike dogs, you're allowed to decide you don't want to be around them. But I do feel you need to look at this from a more varied angle. You're expecting your brother to make sacrifices and cater to you, but would never consider it the other way around. I love dogs, I love children! I have 2 dogs and am pregnant, I can understand the limitations that comes with both. That said, knowing the limitations both present to not only myself but other people on vacation with me. I can tell you that you're being judgemental and not acknowledging what people are giving up for you and your family, while getting annoyed at just the idea of the dog coming.

Seems my brain is not functioning on all cylinders right now.", "But other lives don't?", "Saying all human lives matter is laughably dumb. Your responses consistently prove why some people suck, and why some people would save a pet before another human being.", "ALL LIVES MATTER. Deciding that one life means more then another is a trait of god complex. You deciding that animals are lesser then humans is a lack of empathy and awareness, and mental disorder traits.  The simple fact that you think you can justify picking and choosing one life over another is disgusting and you yourself are an inhumane person. I truly hope you don\u2019t own pets, if you do they deserve someone who\u2019s actually love them.", "Human lives matter the most. It's not a question of absolute. It's one of priority.", "Humans, animals then plants. I don't lack empathy for animals. You are making a false assumption. One can like or love animals and still do not equate that to the value of human life. I wish you more sincere friends and family. Perhaps you have childhood trauma to work through."]}
