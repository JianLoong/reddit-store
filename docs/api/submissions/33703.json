Then, you used her for free labor 12+ hours a day and verbally abused her? You are a huge AH. That poor kid. I hope you have stopped working with children.", "Did you know, currently, 16 year olds cannot work more than 8 hours on non-school days under federal child labor laws in the US?\n\nYou had a student minor report to your home and complete unpaid labor because she tripped.  Then made her cry multiple times.\n\nYou are a lot of things. But I\u2019ll leave it at YTA.", "YTA. She was helping you. Why on earth would you have someone handle expensive equipment?  \n  \nNot only that, in todays world, it sounds very weird for a 43 year old man to say they grew \"particularly close\" to a student and then have her go over to your house. Very early in the morning until 7pm? That's just very unprofessional and on top of that, that's a lot of hours.  \n  \nHuge YTA.", "\u201cBecause I had forgiven her\u201d \n\nSo she had to work until you \u201cforgave\u201d her? What is wrong with you? You sound like a creep and I actually wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you deliberately set her up so she would owe you her time one way or another. I mean of course you want to offer her a job after this...so you can be around her more. Do the world a favour and stay away from her and anyone underaged.", "YTA.  You deliberately took advantage of her.  If the equipment was so valuable, it should have been (1) insured, and (2) not entrusted to a teenager.  She wasn\u2019t careless, and it could have just as easily been you that tripped.  \n\nAlso, it\u2019s creepy that you, at 43, coerced a 16 yo girl to come to your house alone on multiple occasions.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you had her parents permission, it was still inappropriate.", "YTA. You let a teen carry your most expensive gear and then had her come to your home and work the weekends. And you made her cry? Nothing about this story is okay.", "You sound extremely creepy. Children should not be anywhere near you.", "YTA for expecting a 16 yr old to work what sounds like ~12 hour days, and being so hard on her that she cried. I'm glad you realized that you needed to ease up, but you were still an asshole there to begin with. It's reasonable to suggest she do some work to repay you for the broken equipment, but you can't treat her like you would a paid adult professional.", "Wtf you\u2019re 100% TA. I\u2019m also a photographer and why didn\u2019t you just claim insurance instead of being a creep?! Ew. You give the industry a bad name. I hope you\u2019re reported for this.", "YTA\n\nShe was helping you. She tripped.\nShe shouldn't have to work for you.\nLet's put it this way. If your working and some things break on your shift should you have to come In Extra days for no pay?\n\nPlus she's a child.\n\nIf you tried this with my kid I'd be livid", "Let's consider the power dynamic of a middle agreed man commanding a 16 year old girl to do things until she cries. Regardless of context that sounds like a pretty big abuse of the power dynamic. When her parents agreed for her to work, I highly doubt that reducing a child to tears is what they had in mind. YTA", "YTA. You made her cry? You shouldn\u2019t have let her carry your stuff in the first place but then you forced her to work for you and you treated her badly? How can you even ask if you are an AH?", "YTA, if that equipment was that valuable, and it's your livelihood, \n\n1. It should have been insured\n2. You should never have left it with a 16 year old to carry down multiple flights of stairs and across a parking lot. \n3. I agree with your mother.", "YTA If you find yourself growing 'particularly close' to 16yr olds, stay away from them.\n\nYou dont make 16yr olds cry multiple times as a 'good learning experience'. Quite bluntly, it sounds like negging or trauma bonding. \n\nIf the stuff was so damn valuable you should have carried it yourself.\n\nHer parents are AHs for putting her in a risky situation, there was a complete lack of structure  and a severe imbalance of power. There is absolutely no way May didnt feel trapped and powerless in the situation. *You were making her cry and she still had to be with you for* ***hours***", "Jeez, you're such a nasty and awful asshole. What she did was an accident. What you did was deliberate. You abused that poor girl and it sounds like you enjoyed it. You're a disgusting asshole and you shouldn't be allowed anywhere near minors. YTA", "YTA you made her cry??? Please don't work with kids any more. You cannot handle it.", "YTA!\n\nYou're a professional. At the end of the day, you should've had insurance on the equipment and it was your responsibility. I have seen wedding photographers, MUAs, etc get thousands of property damage on equipment vital to their business. At the end of the day, that is the cost of running a business!\n\nIf any adult accidentally damaged your equipment, perhaps a guest at an event, would you have immediately sued them or attempted punishment? Are you only punishing her & taking advantage of her because she is underage? Does she have an \"outs\" from this agreement to work? Would you feel uncomfortable if her parents read this reddit post?", "I mean you were basically punishing her for making a mistake. It's unfortunate that she broke your equipment, and I can certainly understand you being upset about it but even you admit that she accidentally tripped. She didn't break your equipment on purpose and she said she was sorry, so what lesson were you supposedly teaching her and what did you eventually \"forgive\" her for? I can't wrap my head around your reasoning. YTA", "YTA. She had an accident and was apologetic. That was all that was necessary. Who thinks it is okay to repeatedly verbally abuse a child to the point of tears over an accident?", "YTA, and everything in this post is beyond creepy and unnatural for a working professional and a minor. I hope you pay her back for wasting her time over an accident when she could have been working a paid job at her age, and I hope she doesn\u2019t work for you in the future if you\u2019re going to be expecting \u201caction over words\u201d", "Everything about this is wrong. If you don\u2019t care about the child you should be concerned at least about yourself as a middle aged man with a child at your home for 12 hours. All kinds of wrong actions can be implied and how will you defend yourself? As a parent I would have come down so hard on you. It\u2019s your responsibility for equipment that had so much value to you to be used at a school.", "YTA. If the equipment was that expensive and sentimental than You should have been carrying it. She tripped, it was an accident. Even if she agreed to work off the damage, you sound proud of making a TEENAGER cry. What the Frick did you do to her? Also really creepy for a grown man to be alone in his house with a teenager; especially for that long.", "YTA, she\u2019s a child and working that many hours is insane. You should have just asked the parents to pay for it instead.", "Yeah, YTA here. She tripped, it was an accident (next time, insure irreplaceable things or don\u2019t let a teenager carry them). Punishments for accidents are usually unnecessary. Then to make her cry because you\u2019re too hard on her? Then you offer her a job? I dunno, man, this is all a little weird.", "Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
