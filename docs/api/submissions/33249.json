A year ago, I could cut up and cook them, no prob. Just couldn't eat them. But now, I can't touch them.. can't be in the same room or area if they're being cooked or heated up or cut, etc etc. I get really itchy EVERYWHERE and turn red amd get hives. It's awful. I have to take benadryl to help alleviate the symptoms, but benadryl makes me super sleepy. Can't drive, hard to take care of the kids bc I'm so sleepy and miserable. I've had to leave work on multiple occasions bc people were eating them in the lunchroom, and my Thanksgiving even took a bad turn when a family member cut up bell peppers for salad bc they \"forgot\" about my allergy. \n\nI have asked my bf to please not bring bell peppers in our home. He likes to cook with them sometimes bc he likes the flavor. He has continued to cook with them once in a while and every time, I get really upset bc it ruins my entire day bc of the reaction and having to take benadryl.

Well I didn\u2019t take amoxicillin for several years from late elementary through high school, I got prescribed them again in my late teens and this time instead of hives my tongue swelled up and my throat started itching. I was closely monitored to make sure my airway didn\u2019t start constricting and was told the next time I took them I might not be so lucky. I now wear a medical alert bracelet because it\u2019s very possible another exposure could kill me. Allergies can grow more severe with absolutely no indication very quickly. Either your boyfriend starts taking this seriously and stops bringing your allergen into the house or you need to leave him. Don\u2019t wait to have a life threatening episode.

I hadn't mentioned it because he was cooking fresh food and not using pre-packaged foods, where you usually find it.  I didn't know it could be purchased for consumer use.", "I wish this was higher up. I developed/found out I was allergic to a handful of things during college and on. In the beginning, it was only hives so I\u2019d just take a benadryl and still eat the items. It has progressed to the point where if I eat them now, I develop breathing issues. I have to carry two epi pens around. Prolonged and repeated exposure can make your allergies worse. Please do whatever you need to keep bell peppers away from you because you may develop a life threatening reaction.", "All but one of my allergies started this way, first it was none, then a little bit of a reaction, then gradually got worse."]}
