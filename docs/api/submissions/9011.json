We were together for over two years and lived together for the larger portion of that time. We realized the renting situation in our town is shit so we decided to buy a house. I got the loan in my name because his credit score was garbage. Well one day he was acting odd and was very closed off and went for a 2 hour long run when I had requested to talk about the issue. The next day while I was at work I messaged him and asked him if everything was okay and he broke up with me stating he just didn\u2019t feel the same anymore and he doesn\u2019t know why. I respected his feelings and I asked him what he wanted to do. He didn\u2019t have any places lined up so I told him he could stay for a week or two so he could find a place, he explained to me that he didn\u2019t have money for the mortgage since he would have to move and buy new stuff for his new place. I told him that was fine and if he were to clean and fix some things around my house we could call it even since I work about 70 hours a week and don\u2019t have much time for that. He agreed. While he stayed with me after the breakup he constantly wanted to sit on the couch and talk about it and if I were going out with my friends he would act upset, he also constantly was trying to hook up during this time and I\u2019ll admit I caved a few times because I missed him. Well one night I came home from a girls night and he seemed upset with me over it. I ignored him but he asked me if he could stay a little longer rent free since he hasn\u2019t found a place he likes. I told him no and explained that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable since I\u2019m trying to move on with my life and that\u2019s hard to do with him present. He didn\u2019t seem to understand and I got pretty upset and told him that he should just be happy I hadn\u2019t kicked him to the curb and explained I couldn\u2019t live with someone I love who doesn\u2019t love me back. The argument escalated and I called him narcissistic and he yelled at me and said \u201cat least I don\u2019t hide behind my mental illness\u201d. For reference I do have bipolar disorder type 2 and major depressive disorder that\u2019s managed with medications but I will still have episodes of depression that are hard for me to manage at times. This is where I told him to get the fuck out of my house and that he can\u2019t lecture me on mental health when he won\u2019t accept help for his. (He has depressive episodes but refuses help for them) He packed his stuff and left for his moms place. The last time we spoke (to get his stuff) he told me he couldn\u2019t believe I had said those things to him and he doesn\u2019t recognize me anymore.

He broke up with you but wanted all the same benefits. Sleeping with you, cheap rent, your attention, control over you going out.

But he's, the one that wanted ability to walk away while at same time wanting a pseudo relationship with you.", "NTA, he broke up and you (in my opinion) very very graciously allowed him to live in your house and paying by doing chores. If he's being this rude you have every right to kick him out.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThat argument got heated because you were righting your very recently broken-up ex. Who himself also has trouble letting go, it seems.\n\nSince this argument doesn't seem to be about money, but about how you treated each other, I'll judge on that. Breaking up with someone and then continuing to hook up with them is pretty gross. He's taking advantage of the feelings you still have for him and keeping them alive, in some form or other, while he probably feels free to play the field at the same time; after all, \"you're no longer together\".\n\nYou did the right thing to get a clean break with this dude. As long as the money part is sorted (has he paid towards the mortgage at all, for instance?), you're in the clear.", "NTA after breaking up with you, he could have gone to his mom immediately.

I bet you find yourself feeling more stable without his influence in your space too.", "NTA\n\nhe was gaslighting you and you said no to his bs\n\ni despise people who don't respect their mental health and disregard others\n\nyou go queen!", "No men just think they can take advantage and keep close supply. He's the asshole and probably a narc. If you don't love someone and break up then why do you still use them and wanna be around them. Scary. I hope you're safe now.", "INFO\n\nIf you bought the house together, how can you just kick him out? Regardless of whose name is on the loan, if he contributed he should get his fair share of the property.

It makes no difference who took out the loan. You might not have the right to kick him out.", "NTA.  He said cruel things to you.  You reacted to this.  \n\nHe broke up with you, then wanted to keep all the benefits of living with you, AND not have to pay for them.  **His behavior was possessive, as if the relationship hadn't ended.**  Basically, **he was taking advantage of you, not just relationship-wise, but also financially.**  \n\nYou say he hadn't found a place he likes, so he wanted to stay longer. Sounds like he wasn't looking very hard, like he was being choosy.  Generally, when you break up, you find anything that will do, and look for the place you like for the next rental contract, not the one where you need to leave fast.\n\n *I told him no and explained that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable since I\u2019m trying to move on with my life and that\u2019s hard to do with him present.*\n\n**All you did was say \"no\" to him** continuing to live there free, where he could continue to take advantage in multiple ways.  **Manipulators will pretend to not understand,** when they just want to keep you talking and wear you down until you comply.   He broke up with you, not you with him.  He understood well enough that **he was trying to keep hold on you and your place**.  And he got upset because you weren't complying and letting him stay.\n\nI wonder if he was really \"not understanding\" why you weren't begging him to get back together, and that his real anger was because you said you were moving on.  There are manipulators who will break up just to get you to take on more responsibility, even do this as a pattern so their partner slowly takes on all the responsibilities just to keep them. \n\nAll the other manipulations didn't work for him.  So he resorted to insults and cruelty.  And you had enough and reacted to that.  \n\n*he told me he couldn\u2019t believe I had said those things to him and he doesn\u2019t recognize me anymore.*\n\nManipulators want us to believe that we are defective, that we are to blame, that we should feel guilty when we don't comply with their wants and their demands and their requests.  **When he says you aren't the old you, he means you aren't complying with his wants.**  \n\nWhen he said that he couldn't believe you said those things, **he's conveniently ignoring all that he did** to you, **and all that he said** to you, before you reacted.\n\nLook at the other things that he has said to you, the things that echo in your head yet.  How many of those were said to control you, to manipulate you, or to get something from you?  \n\nI think you have much to be proud of, that you didn't let him stay, that you didn't let his possessiveness fool you into thinking he wanted to get back together and you didn't fall into those traps.   The next step of healing is to get his words out of your head by seeing them for the lies they are.", "Nta. he was mooching off you, got jealous you were trying to move on. \nGiven he ended it he should of thought about where he would leave to to begin with\nAnd he shouldn't use personal responses to hurt you then get upset you want him to leave.

No contract no nothing. This isn't really how people are, desperate to hold ontop something you didn't pay for. Also I doubt he actually cleaned or cooked or did anything at this house so no go.

This is their style", "OP said the loan is just in her name but didn\u2019t say who\u2019s on the title", "It\u2019s my name on the deed.
