I assumed she started hearing stuff from school so I reinforced that Santa was real because i wasnt ready for her to find out. She hid her Christmas list and told us she forgot what she wrote.

So with that I decided my oldest was old enough. \n\nI sent my middle to her room and sat my oldest down for the big talk. She took it very well (I was expecting anger for lying since that is a big thing in our house) she said \"so you are mrs clause and daddy is Santa clause?\" I told her yes and asked why she had been asking so many questions. \n\nApparently the kids at school have been teasing her for 'being a baby' and still believing in Santa and the Easter bunny. I told her that what those kids did was not nice and that should she ever come across someone who still believes then she needs to let them believe and pretend so that they don't feel the way she felt. She agreed. \n\nNow I'm worried ITA Because her grandmother is furious with me over telling her and says I should have kept lying and told her the other kids are wrong. She told my daughter \"if you don't beleive, you don't receive\" basically saying if my daughter didn't beleive in Santa or the easter bunny they wouldn't come. So AITA?

She's punishing a child for growing up and placing blame on an 8 year old for things she didn't do. \n\nShame on grandma, shes being toxic, and controlling; and probably shouldn't be front and center at future holidays. Maybe see her later in the day or week so the kids aren't pressured into performing the holiday to her preferences.", "This is a truly personal choice for your family.

Honestly I feel that there's made way too much of a fuss about these imaginary things in general and it creates problems where there don't need to be any.

I love holidays and my parents still give me little somethings for the holidays even as an adult because celebrating and spending time with family is just fun. I even give them little somethings because it's just fun to give and enjoy the holiday spirit. When I was a kid I'd set out Doritos and Dr. Pepper (my mom's favorite snacks) because I knew Santa wasn't real, but I still loved the tradition so I adjusted it. I don't set out snacks anymore but still, it was fun! Grandma is a stick in the mud, have your daughter be a little elf in helping keep the magic alive for your 5 year old. Your older daughter can still get fun things too, only now they can be involved as well.", "NTA, believing in things like that is pointless to begin with", "I have real trouble understanding this tradition of telling children Santa is real into school age. It might be kinda cute for small children - they have a lot of magical thinking but it's part of growing up to tell reality from fantasy. As soon as they are old enough to understand that the princess from the fairytale is just as made up as the evil witch, they are old enough to understand that Santa is made up. And that it's perfectly fine to play pretend nevertheless, and that something being made up doesn't mean it can not be cute, funny, entertaining or worthwhile. \n\nBasically, once they start asking questions in my opinion YTA for not being honest. And once she starts to do whole experiments to find proof, you went way beyond the point of telling her. You know, you could have told her like 2 years ago and have her help you keep the illusion up for just a little longer for the little one - but you \"were not ready\" to tell her earlier. It's not about when you are ready, it's about when she is ready. You could tell by the questions she asked. \n\nI'm glad you finally told her, Grandma is delusional for being furious over this, but YTA still for not telling her earlier. Just my opinion, do with it what you want.", "NTA- you handled it well", "NTA", "NTA, unfortunately there comes a time in every child\u2019s life where this is a discussion that needs to happen. Mine came around that age too, and it\u2019s not a huge deal. Your daughter took it well and you did a good job by telling her to keep it a secret and explaining it gently.

Something I hope to implement when I have children is to make it clear that such traditions are Pretend, not real from the get go.

Is it true that there is a giant Bunny who leaves eggs and treats and Easter baskets?\n\n I answered her that no it wasn't true but that the magic of the Easter Bunny was a true and special thing for children. We walked a few more steps and I knew the other shoe was about to drop. So about Santa Claus and the flying reindeer?

That she would still get to enjoy the magic, and would still get to have fun thinking about the Easter bunny and Santa Claus but that she was now also a member of the club and shouldn't tell other children about making the magic.

I'm in the club!\" She never told another child, and her sister happily believed until she had her own questions, at which point she also joined the club.", "I'm American and my mom always told me that it was a fun game play, not that it was a real thing.
