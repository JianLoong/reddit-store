This is a recurring issue that came to a head yesterday. \n\nMy wife and I are adults in a very particular type of relationship - our house reflects that. I'll refrain from going into too much detail but its not kid friendly. \n\nMy brother and his wife are aware and don't completely agree, but once again, we are adults.\n\nI have always been very transparent with the fact that I don't want their kids over. Honestly I'd prefer if they didn't come in, either, just because I'm a very private person. \n\nAnyway, recently our dad turned sixty, and we all met up for a couple drinks and the like. At the end of the night they, brother and sil, asked if they could stop by my place later in the week.\n\nI said yes, but its not kid friendly, so I don't want them bringing the children. I thought they understood. \n\nLo and behold, two days later, they show up with the kids. I told them they couldn't come in, my brother then says the little one needed the toilet and he was hoping they could use the bathroom before they dropped them off at their aunts for the day. \n\nDidn't really want the kid to piss on my doorstep so I let them through. They were all very intrigued and I was uncomfortable. They all peed and left.\n\nMy brother and SIL arrive back a couple hours later and everything was alright. They were nervous, I think, but it was fine all in all.\n\nUntil the next day when my brother called me up and informed me that his kids were asking inappropriate questions (and one thought I was harming my wife).\n\nI am not, obviously, and told him as such. He then launched into a \"this is your fault, explain it to them\" rant. I told him they were his kids, his problem, left it at that.\n\nIt was fine, I think. \n\nMy brother then showed up again a couple days after that and asked why I never wanted anyone over. We've had this discussion before so I knew where it was going and I should have stopped it before it started.\n\nHe went on to tell me that its a shame that my house isn't child friendly, because the kids love me, and I should have them around more. I told him I didn't want that. \n\nThen he uttered the great, \"I just think you should tone it down a bit. For the kids.\"\n\nAnd I replied in a series of words something along the lines of \"I wont be toning shit down for your rugrats. I don't want them here.\"\n\nHe got upset and called me a self centered asshole. Then he left. \n\nI could have been nicer, I know, and my wife says the same - I'm just tired of him constantly trying to force the kids on me. \n\nHis wife texted me and said, essentially, \"if you hate the kids that much you'll have no problem going no contact,\" Which hurts a little because I don't want to never see them again. I just don't want them in my house.\n\nNow I'm conflicted. Did I go too far? I don't feel like I did.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684839909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pla4c/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_i_will_not_be/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s that it opens the door to exactly the scenario you had to deal with, which is being subtley shamed about your lifestyle. \n\nI completely understand your defensiveness about the constant desire to invade your space. So while you were a little harsh, I can see it comes from being made to feel uncomfortable and negatively received, and pressured to change, over and over and over again. Not to mention no doubt a lifetime of this in various forms by society. \n\nTBH I think what your brother did was a set up to force this confrontation.

You can spend time with them perfectly well at plenty of other locations.\n\nSounds like they're really just upset because they want to be able to drop said kids off at your house any time for you to babysit them without warning.

You are not making an effort to build a relationship with your niblings. It\u2019s your right to not do so, but not doing so is lightly AH behaviour, and being so needlessly shitty about it is absolute AH behaviour.\n\nHonestly, you also suck for setting up your home such that nobody can ever visit or socialise without being uncomfortably clear on your sex life, and then getting shitty when it\u2019s pointed out that that\u2019s super fucking weird. To be clear: your boring bondage kink is not super weird, it\u2019s so normal that it\u2019s next door to vanilla these days. It\u2019s your attitude to it and to others about it that is weird. You\u2019re allowed to be weird about it; you\u2019re allowed to set your house up as a shrine to your fantasies so anyone who comes over will be uncomfortable; you\u2019re allowed to never host family or otherwise fulfil normal social interactions. Those are all antisocial ways to behave, rising to the level of seriously gross if you inflict your setup on people who have to be in your home for work (plumbers? other repairs?

It's not like he didn't warn them.", "But isn\u2019t everyone knowing this kinda forcing people to be aware of your kink?", "I mean if you ever have guests I\u2019d read that as not keeping your kink private", "Who knows. OP hasnt said and there\u2019s a whole lot of things this could be.", "This was my read as well.", "Thats kind of what I want to know - is it a matter of putting some toys in a drawer or is it or objects that just cant be put away. Literal furniture, upholstery, etc.", "we're assuming you have a bunch of weird kinky stuff throughout your house, and that you had your wife tied up when the kids came in to use the bathroom.  \n\n\nETA: that's totally cool, too.", "I mean that if your home is such that it takes hours to hide your shit if the plumber comes over then I think it\u2019s obvious that sex is priority number one and that\u2019s just not usually a person I vibe with.  Not a judgement (although rereading my contributions to this post I do seem like a judgementy ah myself), your home, your castle, yadda yadda yadda but I just wonder if you\u2019ll regret the widening gulf between you and your family as you get older and they become more important and the sex becomes less important", "That was my first thought too honestly, but then as I was typing my reply it was replaced with his brother being concerned about him. \n\nIf things are not kid friendly in the home, I doubt the brother is trying to leave his kids there as much as possible. I think the \"make it more kid friendly\" is code for \"make your house normal dude...\".\n\nI'm pretty libertarian by nature and genuinely think that people should do what makes them happy, but it's easy to not care about people living freaky lifestyles if you don't care about the people. When it's family and you care about them I'm sure it's harder to just accept.", "> In fact, no one I know would want to bring their kids over to a house that wasn't kid-friendly.\n\nExactly. I don't think this really has much to do with the kids for the brother. I think it's about wanting him to tone down his lifestyle choices. Maybe due to concern, maybe due to puritanical judgement. Who knows. But I don't think it's about the kids visiting, it's about confronting him about his lifestyle.\n\nIf OP wants his brother to accept his lifestyle choices, he needs to explain why he's living this way. If. It's optional. Right now under the status quo there's no relationship at all.", "Considering he said it during a serious argument, it probably wasn\u2019t said in an affectionate way", "I\u2019d say he becomes the asshole by seemingly disparaging his nephews and nieces and then being upset when the proposition of going NC with them is raised. Gotta pick a lane there and if his issue is just with the adults be more careful not to loop the kids in", "By seeming very cold toward his family and prioritizing his sex life to the point that his house is a shrine to whatever kink shit he keeps alluding to", "The rugrats comment about the kids. It sounds rude. I'm not familiar with the words so do correct me if it isn't a rude thing where OP comes from.", "I don't know if I walked into a house and saw all that I'd be like these are some cool people. Not my kink but I like people who live their lives not stuffing things in closets so to fits the norm.", "yeah but he insults the kid, fair play the brother is being an asshole hence why i said esh", "his friends, if there's kink stuff everywhere they're probably into full time kink which means unless they have no guests over then they're involving other people", "I\u2019m not seeing the difference with the repairman. I assume kids visiting would also be temporary and take the same total effort to move the stuff. But yes he wants the repairman and not the kids there despite the two requiring the same degree of effort to prep for.\n\nI get rugrats isn\u2019t a dirty word but it\u2019s disparaging particularly in the way OP used it. I had never given a judgement just piggybacked off another comment. My judgement would be ESH", "Oh I agree. But let's face it, if it's the whole house, it ain't just the kids they don't want there lol", "His bedroom? The entire upper floor and/or basement? But it seems weird that someone just using the powder room is going to be exposed to that much stuff.", "I mean it's in the privacy of their home. You'd expect the people they allow in their home to respect who they are.\n\nJust like.. I dunno.. I'm not poly but I don't expect my friends to not be poly when I'm around them. Or like... I don't have delicate stuff in my house but we have friends with a buttload of collectables that are breakable and my kids and I respectfully stay away from them. \n\nHiding who you are in your own home is uncomfortable. For example my eight year old loves horror and has amassed such a collection that not it's a headache to put it away when people visit so the kids that are scared don't come to our home anymore and we meet with them elsewhere.\n\nYour house, your rules. It's your private space. No one should have to pretend in their private space.", "Well given op brother and SIL asked to come over and is aware of the house situation.

Instead of being an adult with an open conversation about his concern.\n\nLets be honest our family members have kinks we would probably be concerned about however we choose to oblivious to it.

It doesn\u2019t sound like op is doing anything harmful to their or someone else\u2019s body. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want someone inserting themselves in to your sex life then you should stay out of others.", "So weird haha. I can't imagine it being said in a facetious way.", "Some people aren't into kids? I don't think that makes them assholes. My younger brother is private and would very much dislike being saddled with any of our kids. He's always polite to them and stuff in person. He's just not a kid person and that's totally fine?

We tried hiding it but in the end we got too tired with it.", "I'd just be all curious asking questions", "Not knowing if op refers to them as rugrats as a negative or enduring way hard to know if that makes me ah.", "Or maybe his friends have been informed beforehand and have made the decision on their own as to whether or not they're comfortable with that?", "I get the impression OP doesn\u2019t actually want *anyone* else in his home.

It's a stuffed chibi willy with eyes and a smiley face. Makes a nice pillow for the couch. You can find it on Amazon just search stuffed pns plush just add the vowels. it would be a great thing when your bro visits.

Didn\u2019t mean to imply otherwise. But I think OP also has some share of asshole for lashing out at kids even though he was only mad at his brother and also for seemingly being unwilling to accommodate his nephews and nieces who he presumably cares about. He\u2019s well within his rights to do so, but I still say it makes him a bit of an AH", "I mean he didn't want them in his home and made that clear though. So the parent is clearly the one in the wrong.", "I mean... It does? My kids had a lot of questions.\n\nBut again... Op specifically stated to **not** bring the kids to the house. So it's 110% the parents fault because they knowingly walked into that situation.", "Eh? Who says everyone knows about it? \n\nObviously his family would have some awareness but I assume they only inform who they want to inform.", "They need the repair guy and are willing to make his visit more comfortable.  They don't want kids in their home.  Seems practical to me.", "This isn't the 1920s. People shouldn't have to hide in shame of people knowing anyone. There's a big difference between forcing your kinks on people, and being open about having them.", "By saying he didn't want them here? And he didn't want to alter his home and lifestyle for the sake of his brothers kids. Still sounds reasonable to me?", "He called the kids \"rugrats\" after his brother and SIL intentionally and repeatedly pushed his clearly stated boundary about not bringing the kids in the house. If that's \"lashing out\" then it's maybe on the scale of an eyelash at worst.", "For me and *my* lifestyle, that's the same. I have a brother who doesn't like us visiting (asexual and very much not a kid person) and I completely respect this and am not at all offended. I have a friend with kids who doesn't have other people over, simply because it stresses her out. I don't care about that either.\n\nPeople can live however they want. Clearly OP sees their family outside of their home so wtf is the issue?!", "In your home where you don't have people over presumably unless they're already aware? Not that weird.", "They have seen worse than a fuckin whip on the table lmao. They consent to seeing it or we meetup elsewhere.", "The comment about how they will *tidy up* for repair people but not for family is what really makes me question that we need to know more. \n\nI agree, they said dont bring the kids so fine. But why will OP not subject some random repair person to this but will their own family? I think this is missing info.", "I mean considering polyamory is just a normal relationship but with multiple partners, how complex is that to explain in a kid friendly way? It might not be a social norm but I cant think it\u2019d lead to any embarrassing question? What did your kids ask you?", "Sounds like they are forcing people to know if it\u2019s something everyone\u2019s aware of", "With the amount of crap people publicize about their lives nowadays, it's actually disgusting to me that kink shaming is still such a massive thing.", "By saying something along the lines of \u201cim not toning shit down for your rugrats\u201d. I suspect rugrats was not the actual word used but even if it was he\u2019s lashing out at children when he\u2019s actually annoyed with his brother.

The parents ignored this and so the responsibility is theirs.\n\n> But why will OP not subject some random repair person to this but will their own family? I think this is missing info.\n\nBecause he needs repairs done and wants to avoid awkward and uncomfortable judgement - kind of like the stuff splattered all over the comments to this post lmao. Why would he subject he and his wife to a complete strangers judgement?", "We're super open with our kids so they know all about sex and stuff and we're just very confused as to how it all worked. Our poly friends (two sets) both have primary partners with kids who my kids know and each partner has seperate partners. It's not a triad or anything. So they were just confused about how it all functions because they're aware that if say, my husband slept with someone - that would be wrong. \n\nI dunno. I don't actually get embarrassed by questions and tbh would explain kink very easily too. But they certainly had a lot of questions", "To me that seems directed at the brother as it was the brother suggesting he tone it down just so they could bring over their kids (which OP clearly stated he didn't want anyways)\n\nIdk. I have loads of friends without kids and *never* make the assumption I just just head on over to their house. Even the ones with kids i don't assume that. I have friends I've known for years whose house I haven't ever been to. I just truly don't understand the issue and find it way, way worse that his brother was trying to force him to change his home just because he wants to visit. Which again... Op said he didn't want.", "But he did say yes to his brother coming, who has indicated he is uncomfortable too. So is it a matter of the house having some kink objects lying around that could be put away easily or this is their lifestyle and that just cant happen i.e. the actual furniture etc \n\nBrother clearly shouldnt have brought the kids over", "Definitely agree the brother is an AH in this situation but I don\u2019t think OP comes out great either. I would say ESH. He\u2019s pissed at adults and directed his anger partly at kids. That\u2019s not right", "> I said yes, but its not kid friendly, so I don't want them bringing the children. I thought they understood.\n\nThe brother being there was never the problem? Sounds like he would have been fine with the brother coming in without the children present.\n\n> Then he uttered the great, \"I just think you should tone it down a bit. For the kids.\"\n\nThe brother wasn't saying 'tone it down because I'm uncomfortable' (even if he was - just meet us somewhere neutral lol) he was expressly telling them to alter their home for the sake of kids that aren't even theirs."]}
