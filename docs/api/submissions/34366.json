{"id": 34366, "submission_id": "18yvuu7", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend we may need to drop his nephew from our trip?", "selftext": "My boyfriend (27M), Nick, has an older sister, named Megan, that works for an airline. One of the perks of Megan working for an airline is that she has multiple ways she can give family and friends free standby flights. There are three ways she can give these to family/friends.\n1. Her children can fly standby whenever they want. \n2. She can choose a single family member, outside of kids and spouse, to fly standby unlimited for a year. \n3. She gets a certain number of buddy passes each year that she can give to anyone to fly standby for a single roundtrip. \n\nMegan had an extra buddy pass and offered to give it to me, because Nick is able to fly standby this year. I have always dreamed of going to Japan during Cherry Blossom season, so we decided we would use it there.\nNick called Megan to ask for tips on how to get there, since we Cherry Blossom season may cause planes to be more full. Megan's son, Jack (21M), lives with her and after she finished the call she told him that Nick and I were planning on traveling to Japan. Jack told Megan that he wants to come with us, and Megan texted my boyfriend. \n\nNick then texted me asking how I felt about it. I told him that the main issue I had with it was that it would make planning the trip harder, since he may not want to do what we are doing and that it also makes it more difficult for us to all get flights there. Jack has unlimited standby flights, so he could go to Japan whenever he wanted. I only have the buddy pass, so I don't know when I am going to get a chance to go again. Nick told me he gets it, that he was not too thrilled when he heard Jack wanted to come, and he would talk to him. I then texted I understand that Jack might want to have travel buddies, and I am not completely against the idea. I think it would be a good chance to hang out with him. I suggested us putting together a plan of what we want to do and sending it to him and seeing what he would like to do with us, but but if flights are looking full around that time we may need to drop the trip.\n\nThe next day my boyfriend brought up how I was willing to drop his nephew from the trip if it was busy, and said it seemed selfish. I told him I thought it was a bit hypocritical because  he did not seem happy Nick wanted to come prior to me sending that text, and told me he would talk to him. He claims he meant talk to him about solo traveling. \n\nTo be honest, I initially thought I was being selfish for being willing to drop him but I don't know when I will have the chance to fly there free again; however, the more I think about it, the more I question if it is actually selfish. The trip was going to be just the two of us, until Jack requested to come. It's not like we initially started to plan this thinking Jack was coming and then kicked him off without  warning. I was open to the idea of Jack coming, but also wanted to be realistic that it logistically might not be a possibility and he needs to be aware of it. So am I the asshole?\n \n\nEdit 2: To further emphasize this since it has come up a lot in comments. Megan gave the tickets to us as a couple. She is not requesting or forcing us to take Jack. Jack heard about the trip and expressed interest so that was communicated to us to decide on if we wanted him to come or if we wanted the trip to remain the two of us.

It was only meant to be a trip for the two of you, and just because Megan gifted you the standby, it is not an excuse for her son to invite himself.\nIf you were happy with him coming that\u2019d be great, but you\u2019re under no obligation to bring him along if you feel uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nJack would probably be third wheeling the trip and not leave you two alone. \n\nPlus, if all y'all can't get on the same plane, you'll have to either dump Jack or not go. Both of which would suck regardless.", "NAH, if Megan and Jack aren't offended by the response. I'd be wary it'd be the last of the free flight privileges moving forward though. If this wasn't one of those you scratch my back, I scratch yours scenario where you two get free flights and her son gets to split meal/lodging/activity costs type of thing.", "NTA and it\u2019s very intrusive when someone just invites themselves on trips", "On a sidenote, if flights are too full to go to Japan, try Sao Paulo in Brazil during our Fall/their Spring. Cherry blossoms bloom there too. I believe Brazil has the largest population of Japanese people outside of Japan so it could be a nice experience.", "NTA being standby is unreliable to begin with, and gets more complicated with more people. It gets even more complicated when  people get but hurt over the possible options. Or is it all in your bf\u2019s head? Too much drama for me.", "NTA. Just because Jack\u2019s mom is gifting you a free ticket doesn\u2019t mean you owe her to let her son come along. It was a gift. It wasn\u2019t a favor that she asked you like hey please accompany my son to Japan and I\u2019ll pay for your ticket to cover it. It was not like that at all.\n\nIf Megan expects favors from you in return of a gift then it\u2019s not really a gift. And it\u2019s up to you if you want to set this precedent of caving in for the sake of a free trip. But you\u2019re definitely NTA and Nick, btw, totally failed on having your back.", "NAH, just need to communicate more. I think you want this as a couple/ relationship trip only. Tell your bf that clearly. He is probably a people pleaser and wants to please all involved.\n\nMaybe you can go for X amount of days, and the last weekend you are there, nephew flies out and you show him a few spots you guys enjoyed them he continues his trip as you leave.", "NTA, the nephew can go whenever he wants. Hell is mom may have pushed him to go to get him out of her hair. Your boyfriend is a little bit of an Ahole since he didn't clarify with you what he meant by talking to him and then gives you an attitude. Hell I'd go alone.", "INFO When I first started reading this I thought it was a child, but you\u2019re worried about a 21 yo? Is he incapable of doing independent things?", "NTA. It's meant to be a couple trip. Jack can go with friends. Megan shouldn't have told him.", "NTA, as you said, Jack has **unlimited** standby flights, you don't.", "YTA - You are getting a free flight due to your boyfriend's familial connection, and are now annoyed that the strings that are allowing you to get a free flight might come with entanglements that aren't optimal for you?  \n\n\nNip your entitlement in the bud, if you can.  Definitely communicate, but take begrudgement on your part off the table.  If you cannot, then you should solve the problem like an adult by paying your own way to Japan and taking \\*exactly\\* the trip you want.", "YTA - you are being selfish. Had you said you wanted this trip to be just the two of you, well okay\u2026 \n\nBut essentially wanting to drop Jack bc he\u2019s another roadblock to you and your free ticket because he\u2019ll be another person on the standby list is selfish. \n\nNot to mention, this ticket is from Jack\u2019s mother. Not a good look.", "Yta. Free tickets from his mother\u2026and you think she will let you fly free if you drop her soon?", "YTA. You are way way way down the list on priorities here from Jack. You\u2019re a lucky duck your boyfriend\u2019s sister hooked you up with this pass. Jack outranks you on the Megan hookup scales by a hundred million times.

I don't know if I would want to spend an entire international trip with a couple.", "Megan wouldn't be, not sure about Jack though. There are no expectations from Megan for us to take him with. Someone suggested maybe Jack fly on a later date and meet up with us on the last couple of days, so he isn't third wheeling. I wouldn't mind him being there, but I don't know if I could spend my entire vacation with a couple.", "Thanks. I have wanted to go to Brazil too, so this is good to know.", "I didn\u2019t know that!  Thank you.", "He definitely is a people pleaser. That is a good idea with having him fly out later. Nick also gets unlimited PTO so he could stay a couple days extra if he and Jack just wanted to travel together.", "Yes, he is a 21 year old man that has flown internationally before", "There are no strings attached to this. Megan gave us the tickets for us to go as a couple. Jack happened to hear about it and said he would be interested in coming with. Megan does not expect us to take him with but let us know so we can discuss it with him. Nick made it seem he didn't want him to come either. If we say no, that doesn't mean the tickets are gone. I could have said no right away, but as I said in the post I think it would be a great way for us to hang out. Ideally I would like us all to be able to go, but logistically it may not be possible.", "I do think back on the conversation and wish I had just said I wanted it to be the two of us, rather than saying I would like him to come if it was possible for us to all get a flight. Definitely would have been a cleaner decision.", "Megan is not asking us to take Jack with us, nor would she force us. In fact these tickets were meant for us to go as a couple and given by her. She simply passed along information for us to make a decision.", "Just curious as to how you think he outranks me? Megan gave us the tickets for us to go as a couple. Jack heard about the trip later and expressed interest. Megan is not requesting us to take him, just letting us know Jack expressed interest. Megan does not care either way.", "Hopefully he gets it instead of clinging on to them.", "Why not suggest that he only comes for half of the trip OP? \n\nThen you could have alone time as a couple and separate time with him. And less risk for the flight out. \n\nHave a great time in Japan!", "I guess I\u2019d worry less about the flights, but expectations of accommodations. He\u2019s a grown.", "Thanks. Someone else suggested this too and I think that is a great idea. Nick also has unlimited PTO, so he could maybe stay an extra day or two and they could travel together.", "True. But yeah, if this was a kid there would be no way his mom would let him on that flight. Not sure if we would even legally be able to take him with us.", "You're making me jealous. Maybe I should ask to come too.", "But 21 years? That seems legal everywhere?", "I'm sure Jack would love the travel buddy"]}
