He was being unreasonable. NTA.", "Absolutely NTA, it really irritates me how many teachers think kids can just hold in their period.   They just assume every time they want to go to the bathroom it is to waste time.  \ud83d\ude21", "NTA. Using the restroom isn't a privilege.", "NTA.\n\nI hate the American education system for making the restroom a \u201cprivilege\u201d for students. I have yet to meet a teacher who withheld these so called \u201cprivileges\u201d from students who didn\u2019t turn out to be an asshole.", "NTA. Your teacher needs to understand that sometimes you NEED to go right now. Good on you for reminding him that there are urgent reasons people need to use the bathroom without him getting shitty about it.", "NTA. Good comeback, he deserved that for being shortsighted.", "NTA he was preventing you from exercising your human right to take care of your personal hygiene.", "NTA. Having to ask for permission to go to the restroom is ridiculous in the first place", "NTA\n\nHe's on a power trip, your answer was perfect.", "NTA and report him to administration.  Refusing to let you use the facilities and embarrassing you in front of the class is not cool.", "inform your parents, inform someone in the office, and then just let them deal with this, you do what you need to do for hygienic concerns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. Perfect handling.", "NTA, It's a period and honestly as a man I'm so sick of other men that are blind and oblivious that women ask to use bathrooms all the time because of this.\n\nHis inability to understand  and being uncomfortable about the fact that women often need to change tampons / pads or even just freshen up should not and should never be your problem.\n\nGood on you for calling him out on his BS.", "NTA - he def is though", "NTA. He's a bully. He got what he deserved.", "NTA - make him out to be a monster.", "NTA The teacher lacks empathy.", "NTA and a legendary retort from you there! Fuck teachers on power trips.", "No sis, you didn't overreact. Also he needs to be reported. Your parent/guardian should do this. They should be furious. You handled the situation with more grace than most adults would.", "I once did this at your age, albeit not about my period. I needed to urinate badly (I misjudged how much water I should drink on a hot day - and I didn't regularly ask to use the bathroom during lessons). It was a sports lesson, with the narkiest teacher in the school. \n\nWe were even resting in our teams, whilst other teams took over (there was never enough equipment). I'd already crossed my legs, whilst it was my team's turn. So I then asked the teacher if I could go to the toilet. She said no. \n\nSo I asked her if I could go and get a mop. She asked why. I told her because she'd need it in a minute, if I couldn't use the toilet. Schools need clear policies, rather than teachers arbitrarily making random judgements. That just ends up in those in genuine need of the toilets, having to suffer/be embarrassed. And meanwhile the kids messing around, will be enabled by the more lenient teachers.", "NTA. When are you & your parents scheduled to see the principal/school board to file complaints,?", "NTA, a grown man mocked a teen girl in front of the class? Yah he\u2019s out of line in a major way. I would report that to school administration honestly. Completely unprofessional and unacceptable behaviour.", "NTA", "Of course you're NTA. Why even ask? \n\nYou can't control that, and he was trying to force the situation. You were barely even impolite.", "NTA\n\n\n\nHonestly, just threatening to bleed all over anything feels like a great tactic to deal with dumb assholes. He'll probably remember this next time you ask to go to the bathroom.", "NTA, I'd also inform whichever supervisor he answers to (after exam season is over to be safe though in terms of potential retaliation). Shit needs to be stamped out early", "I'm not even female and this angers me so much. As a teen male, I've been forced to sit uncomfortably for HOURS because some arrogant 'teacher' doesn't respect my bodily needs.", "NTA. I still don't understand how teachers can deny a student a bathroom break.", "NTA. Being able to leave to use the restroom should be automatic.", "NTA. F that teacher and F the system that makes people ask for permission to go to the bathroom in the first place. Why are we teaching children they don\u2019t have body autonomy. When you gotta go, you gotta go!!\n\nINFO: was this in the USA?", "Absolutely 1000% NTA - But him mocking you in front of the class to the point where the other students are laughing at you deserves to be seriously addressed with the school administration. Teacher should not be allowed anywhere near kids & teens if he/she feels that it's ok to publicly shame any student in their classes for any reason.", "NTA \n\nGood for you!", "\nI don\u2019t understand why there are some teachers that think they can deny someone the bathroom. It\u2019s the weirdest thing to me. 100% NTA and good for you! He sounds insufferable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
