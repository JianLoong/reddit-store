I remember having the little book our teachers would have to initial for bathroom breaks, and I wanna say we were only allowed two breaks a quarter (so two breaks every 2.5 months). The worst time I remember was always right after lunch; everybody is loaded up with food and drink, but somehow we were expected to not let biology happen. What's better, the teachers would often just up and go to the bathroom any time they wanted. Like....what the Hell are you trying to teach us or control? All's you're doing is making sure your janitor earns his paycheck.", "I think our society would be in a significantly better place if we had some sort of system for weeding out bad leaders from leadership positions.", "I know a few teachers, they are all very clear that they started off with open hearts and the best of intentions but when their trust was abused over and over again they eventually learned that they had to assert control over the kids before any learning could happen.  \n\nWould you want to be in a class where the teacher wasn't in control and every arsehole you grew up with was free to do literally whatever the hell they wanted?", "We can still be friends, I swear. :P", "Because we hope that yall smarter people in europe might have fixed such barbaric things, usually.

I have traveled across every continent to dozens of countries, and married into a culture that is incredibly different than the one I was raised in (not bad for a homogenous white kid from the midwest I'd say lol), and honestly while I am not one of those raging nationalists that scream at anyone who makes any criticism about the U.S., it does irk me when someone takes an issue that is not uniquely American and just assumes nobody else in the world has that issue. As the commenter above you said, this is a human issue and deserves global, not just localized, attention.", "As an American, I agree. I think it's because we're also semi-brainwashed to think Canada, Europe, etc, are so much better bc they're not... Y'know, america lol. But they're definitely not perfect!!

I have a few teacher friends myself and mom used to be a teacher too.\n\nBut control and power trip is different. Control is asserting that you have to ask before leaving the class. It allows the teacher to know if the student is going frequently or only when a certain task is happening. Power trip is telling a child that they can\u2019t use the toilet. A power trip creates a situation where the student has to either disobey the teacher and get in trouble or embarrass themselves when something out of their control happens.", "Europe is a big diverse place though.
