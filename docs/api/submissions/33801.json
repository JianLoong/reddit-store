Fuck them all.", "NTA and your girlfriend should stay in her lane.", "Absolutely NTA. I'm extremely biased because I went through a vaguely similar situation with losing my mom (I had just turned 9) and 2 1/2 years later  my father remarrying a woman with two of her own kids. I got kicked out at 16 after years of emotional, verbal, and psychological abuse from them both, as my stepmother brought out the most toxic aspects of my father permanently. He chose my stepmother over me and I was out after that betrayal. We've been permanently estranged since I was 16 and he's been dead to me for over two decades.\n\nEvery so often someone well-meaning asks me about reconciliation, but my requirement is that he take some responsibility for what he did, which my (much kinder and more forgiving) younger sister confirmed will never happen  (she made it to 18 before getting the boot and is low contact with him). My father was thought to be dying from COVID in 2020, and my maternal uncle encouraged me to say goodbye. I relented enough to compromise that he could be given my contact information IF he asked for it. My sister warned me he wasn't there enough mentally, as he was in the ICU, but those were my terms. The AH pulled through (COVID has no sense of karma). Guess what? Despite that near-death experience, he never reached out. Heck, he's estranged from all of his kids, although the problem can't be him, right? /s I'm the most like my father, which is why I'm scorched earth NC with him, while other siblings are various levels of low to no contact.\n\nPeople from decent families don't understand the pain of estrangement, especially when it occurs when you're still a kid. Yes I'm calling teens \"kids' because we still were, and we definitely weren't the adults in the situation.\n\nI would have taken the call, as you did, per my terms listed above that he reach out to me. I don't know how I would have reacted. I would have gotten super p*ssed off that he only wanted to get in touch for support after he lost the kid he chose over me. Would I have started yelling at him? Would I have said \"I have no sister (for the equivalent relationship)\" like you did? I don't know.\n\nWhat's most likely is I would have thrown my phone across the room at the end of the call, which is what I did after the one time we spoke on the phone when I was 21 and he acknowledged absolutely nothing and simply greeted me with, \"Well it's been a while!\" He tried calling me once after that, which I didn't want to answer so much that I physically threw my phone away from myself.\n\nIn the best of all possible worlds, was it kind to say \"I have no sister\" and that you didn\u2019t care she died? I mean, probably not. But this is so painful and emotional that I'm honestly surprised you didn't go nuclear by saying you were happy she was dead. Obviously, that would be an objectively terrible thing to say, but completely understandable for how she contributed to making your life miserable.\n\nIt's super painful and emotional. Your father was also very emotional and in pain for losing the daughter he chose. We can understand that without wanting to have anything to do with him ever, and with a little side eye for only *now* wanting to get back in touch after he lost his chosen daughter. If our experiences hadn't been so traumatizing, it would maybe edge into justified AH. But really, it sounds like you didn't have any control over what you were saying because you were just so angry. Eff him.\n\nI understand your rage. I'm still stuck in rage, although a few years back in therapy I was able to access the utter sadness of losing the great dad I had prior to the stepmother. It's easier and feels safer to be angry. Your girlfriend may still not understand. That's okay, because I'm glad she doesn't have that traumatic family experience.\n\nCheck in with a therapist, if you don't already have one and/or can afford it, to help process the complex emotions in the aftermath. You can also join us at r/EstrangedAdultChild for support.", "NTA.\n\nFuck your dad, the only reason he reached out is because Diana died. Not because he cares or wants to see you again.\n\nHe lost his \u201creal\u201d daughter so now he\u2019s willing to have you come back to try and fill the void. Or who knows, maybe he doesn\u2019t want to look bad at the funeral when family starts asking where you are.\n\nEither way don\u2019t feel bad. Just keep up the no contact and move on.

Absolutely. \n\nLive your best life, and don\u2019t give him another thought, outside of therapy.", "NTA by far. \n\n>She told me later, that I could have been more understanding.\n\nSorry, but she's entirely wrong. Either she doesn't care how horribly you have been treated - or she doesn't know in which case it might be a good idea to tell her. Being kicked out like that and abandoned by their own parent is pretty horrible, if not even traumatic to some extent considering you were only a child when it all started. As you stated it happened over a span of nearly 10 years right after losing someone. It's horrible.", "Nta your dad abandoned you for his golden child and then has the audacity to try guilting you into a relationship with him because all of a sudden his golden child is no longer around you owe him nothing op", "Why does this seem so robotic?", "\"GF, you are right I could be more understanding...my dad was hurting...however you have to know how much I am hurting too... from my point of view my dad replaced me with Diana, and now that she is gone he wants me back to replace her.

And I\u2019m repeating it because you need to see it as many times as possible to reassure yourself you did nothing wrong. He had the chance to make it right for years, but now that his golden child is dead, that\u2019s when he wants to consider fixing everything. Him saying \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d is laughable to me because you haven\u2019t done anything. This was not your doing. You didn\u2019t ask to be abused in your own home.

But it is absolutely understandable why you weren't, and I think you reacted in a normal, emotional way to speaking to him for the first time in 12 years having never been able to voice your feelings and be listened to.\n\nNow, it may have been that before she died, both he and Diana really regretted their past actions, and they have wanted to let you know this for a while, hence the previous attempts to get back in touch. Or it may be that Diana's death has made him realise how fragile life is, so made him want to heal his relationship with you, or a combination of both of those things. But he picked a really inappropriate time and way to get back in touch, and I think your reaction was pretty predictable when he once again made you feel like second-best. \n\nNTA, OP, and I'm sorry you didn't have a dad who insisted that his child was treated as well as his step-child.", "NTA, they\u2019re not your family so I can understand how it doesn\u2019t really matter to you.

People are free to disagree with me, including OP. I'm merely expressing what I think. If you have a problem with that, you can go ahead and say so, but just as I don't expect my words to change others' minds, don't expect your words, especially the mindlessly abusive ones, to change mine.)\n\nWhat happened to you was horrible and tragic and no parent should abandon their kid like that. He is an asshole for choosing her over you, and he doesn't deserve you.\n\nHowever, I also don't believe in kicking people when they're down. When someone is in the throes of grief, you don't verbally abuse them and ream them out. You don't sit there and list all the ways they're a terrible person. And I also don't believe that _anyone_ deserves to die. \n\nI think it's wrong to take pleasure in the death of anyone, or to be happy that a person is dead (yes, even people like H!tler and Ted Bundy). I have no problem with a person feeling _relieved_ that such terrible people are dead, and will no longer cause hurt to anyone, but to find joy in it is wrong.\n\nBecause then you're no better than the person you are glad is dead. How does you're being glad she's dead make you better than everything she did to you? If you're capable of being happy someone's dead, then you have the capacity to be as cruel and selfish to others as she was. I'm not saying you currently _are_, but if you can't see what's wrong with that kind of thinking, where the kind of \"I'm so glad she's dead!\" thought and feeling can lead you, then you should take some time to do some serious self-reflection and maybe seek out therapy to deal with your trauma. \n\nBeing glad someone is dead is as unhealthy as any other toxic behaviour. And to reiterate, there is a difference between being _relieved_ someone is dead, and being _glad_ someone is dead. \n\nHowever, he also doesn't suddenly get a do-over. I suspect her death has either caused him to have a 'come to Jesus' moment where he finally realises what he did to you, or he needs you to come to the funeral in order for him to present a good face to the attendees. \n\nWhile I wish it was the former, I highly suspect the latter. He cares more about his reputation and how bad it will look if you're not there as her 'sister' than he does about actually attempting to mend fences. I don't think you need me to tell you not to go, you seem pretty firm on that yourself. Lose and block his number, then go on living your best life. _That_ is the best 'revenge' you can enact, and is a far more positive outlook than being celebratory that she's dead.

I get it you wanted to hurt him, and you did, but I think if you had just hung up in his face that might have had the same impact. Your dad is the bigger AH because he didn't call to see how you were doing or if you needed anything, it was all about him, and he expected you to fall in line and make him feel better.\n\nYou found out what his intentions were reaching out to you, so now you can go back to ignoring him and go back to living your life.

But he's hurting too, deep in grief, and I think he's realizing he's lost both his children forever.
