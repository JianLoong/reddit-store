I\u2019m so sorry your \u2018mother\u2019 has done this like it\u2019s super bad. Especially as it was 20 QUID A MONTH. And the fact that she lied to you about it. She deserves to get what\u2019s coming. Sue her ass!\n\nThis happened to me and my dad. He put his van in my name so debt collectors wouldn\u2019t take it. He\u2019s now racked up tax bills and parking fines up to 2k. He keeps saying he\u2019ll sort it but he doesn\u2019t. I was young when he did it and he said nothing would get back to me. \n\nIt\u2019s super annoying when you\u2019re young as it could affect you getting a mortgage. Thing is I don\u2019t even drive!!", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely not. \n\nNot to be harsh, but it sounds like your mother wishes to take the money to the grave with her and leave you inevitably with the debt.\n\nI am not certain as to the exact steps you should take. r/legaladvice could help with that.\n\nGo to the company, file a formal complaint and lawyer up. There's a chance that your mother might even get spooked into paying up.\n\nHope it helps.", "NTA. There is no simple \"just pay back\" - your personal credit rating is now _ruined_ for the next seven years or so. It is likely too late to file for fraud since you've let it slide for so long. \n\nYou need to lawyer up and sue her ass for the money _plus_ damages to cover all the future missed opportunities, _e.g._ a new car at an interest rate of 15% instead of 5... \n\nYou _might_ be able to get the credit reporting agencies involved if you can legally prove it was all her fault.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. Don't hesitate to do this - it's gone on for far too long.", "NTA NTA NTA \n\nWhat kind of a mother is she? \n\nGet legal advice and sue her if you can. That\u2019s not okay.", "NTA but I don't think it's a difficult situation. Your \"mother\" is a thief and a manipulative liar. \n\nOf course you need to sue her. As another said, your credit is now in ashes. It's very unlikely non payments will just disappear from your file. This woman needs to be prosecuted, and the golden child's car repossessed and sold, and her credit to be burnt to the ground. \n\nYour father needs to be informed too. Fraud usually doesn't happen with just 1 person", "NTA. You've let this go on way too long. \n\n\u00a320 a month is *33 years* paying off 8k. For the next *33 years* you can't buy a car, a house, have credit cards, borrow in an emergency. You might miss out on jobs that require background checks and good financial standing. And that's only if she keeps paying. And all that time you have garnishment hanging over your head. If you accidentally open a bank account with a provider that she has a card with? Oops, your money is gone to pay *your debt*. Because as far as the law is concerned, at the moment, it is *your* problem alone. If she stops paying there is no fallout for her, it's all on you.\n\nBut here's the most important part: *there is absolutely nothing stopping her from doing this again except for the fact that she has already ruined your credit score*.\n\nThis is way beyond giving your mum the chance to fix things. She had that chance and she *chose to continue ruining your finances on purpose*. She did all of this *on purpose*. She is destroying your future *on purpose*. You owe it to yourself to ensure that she doesn't destroy the rest of your life. You are already going to struggle to recover from the mess she's made, stop letting her make it worse. Take charge and fix it, mummy isn't going to help.", "NTA. You need to get some legal help and file fraud charges against your mother. What she did is a serious crime and the repercussions will follow you throughout your entire adult life if not addressed properly. You need to think about the financial future you want to have, especially if those plans involve a significant other and/or children.", "NTA. She committed fraud and has no intention of making it right. Worse is that she doesn't see a problem with it. \n\nBut if you are going to go down that road, make sure you tell the family and have somewhere to stay, otherwise she could spin the story that you are blaming her for your debt", "NTA also register with these [https://www.cifas.org.uk/pr](https://www.cifas.org.uk/pr) to prevent her from using your details in the future.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu NEED to do it, to protect yourself.", "Ok.  I didn't read your whole post.  BUT.  You should have reported her to the police back in 2019.  I have no idea if anyone will listen to you now, 4 years later.  Still worth a try.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA I am so, so sorry you are in this position by someone who's role it is to love and protect you not commit financial abuse against you. From your post I feel like you have tried every avenue that you can think of to get her to fix this mess that she created by fraudulent means & plenty of time. What your mother has done is illegal & I think you are well within your rights to open a fraud investigation against her to rid your future from her fraud. Good luck OP & may your journey forward bring you relief & peace Xx", "You would only be an AH if you didnt open one.", "NTA\n\nProtect yourself from this person, she is no good for you. And, I promise you that much, most people don't actually change who they are they just adjust to circumstances. She will promise you the moon if she thinks this will appease you.
