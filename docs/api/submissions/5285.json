If one person puts a baby on a spot that accidents can happen, without being sure the other person is aware of it, it's bad parenting. Stop the whole \"mom vs dad\" bullshit to pull a \"poor woman\" card, this isnt about genders, it's about 2 people who are too immature to take care of a baby.  \n\n\nif someone is using a table, and you put a glass of water next to them without them knowing the glass is there, dont be blame only them if they move and knock the glass.

It is actually recommended for when parents are overwhelmed. Make sure the baby is clean, fed, right temperature and safe (in a crib) and walk away for a short time to breathe and calm yourself. \n\nA short time crying in the crib without a parent comforting them is a \\*lot\\* less of a problem than a parent so stressed and overextended that they lose control of themselves.\n\nOh, and I had twins, and there were nights where I was so exhausted from the months of sleep deprivation that I could feel the moment that a parent snaps coming close and I DID put them in their cribs safely and walk away and sit just outside my house for a while. \n\nAgain not knowing what the days leading up to this incident were like I can't say if it was or was not the right response for the g/f to walk away in that moment, or if they had agreed that OP should take melatonin to get a nights sleep before work. \n\nBut the walking away when you are feeling that overwhelmed is HEALTHY.", "I'm not convinced she didn't ask OP to watch baby and OP just ignored her cause of the game.

The OP states that in a comment. If a baby has been crying for hours and you cannot get them to stop the recommended thing to do is to set the baby down in a safe area and walk away. Moms need breaks from crying babies. It\u2019s just the truth. Why would you assume that the mom didn\u2019t set the baby in the crib or another safe place for the time it takes for her to switch out with the dad?\n\nSure, you can argue that the mom should have made sure that OP was in paying attention and aware that she had moved the kid before walking away. But seeing as OP was the one in the room with the kid when they were in the crib, he should have been more aware of the baby in the first place. Or made sure that mom knew that even though he was in that room he wasn\u2019t going to be aware and she needed to plan to be on baby duty.", "For the love of god PLEASE talk to your doctor and ask for some recommendations on parenting books and resources.
