I also assumed he put baby in crib asleep not awake crying maybe im wrong there though.\n\nEDIT: cry it out is actually unsafe pointed out by another user so i retract my saying its a valid method to use to leave baby to cry if they are safe.", "I can almost guarantee that child will have reactive attachment disorder\u2026 so sad because most of the time RAD is preventable.", "You both need some parenting classes and some therapy based on your comments. Please. For the sake of your baby", "If the baby's crib is by the bed it's safe to assume she probably got up when he first started crying and checked on him, OP says she was exiting around the time he was going up after about 30 minutes of him ignoring the cries so are we just going to assume she was sleeping beside the baby and then sitting there ignoring him for 30 minutes before going outside?", "\"Cry it out\" has been found to be incredibly harmful to development. I believe it's talked about in The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog by Dr Bruce Perry (though it's been a few years since I read it, so I may be thinking of another book.) It is NOT appropriate to use the \"cry it out\" method because it has been proven to cause serious and lasting damage. Plenty of horrific things used to be \"health professional approved\". Sometimes, doctors are spouting hypothesis as fact because the research simply doesn't exist."]}
