Not wanting to be on a trip with two couples is totally a fair response.\n\nYou aren't being discriminatory by saying you want a \"girls weekend.\" That's just lame on your friend's part. She doesn't get to decide how you spend your vacation time or money.", "Info: did your friend purchase her tickets with the understanding that you would buy tix from her?", "NTA - she's a dumbass.  Use your own tickets, bring someone you can enjoy the show with, without having to deal with people springing plan changes on you at the last minute.", "NTA. As a single woman, I\u2019ve been in a lot of situations like this. I will tell the other person when I want some thing to be \u201cgirl time\u201d only. I make sure to say that when the planning of the event begins. To nurture relationships you have to spend quality time together.", "NTA. \n\nSelling the 6th ticket so you are the 5th wheel is just odd!", "Nta.   \n\nIf they know they were being their husband's. They should have talked to you about that 6th ticket so you could have found someone or came to a decision together.", "N-T-A. Idk why they would want to bring their husbands and not allow you the opportunity to bring a date or another friend. Also I agree with others, a ts concert? Thats an IMPLIED girls trip. Thats wild to me. I wouldn\u2019t dream of bringing a man to that. I\u2019m not a fan but still.", "NTA. This could be boiled down to two possibilities: 1) it was meant to be a friend's trip, in which case your friend is the AH for inviting others without discussing it, or 2) it wasn't meant to be a friend's trip, in which case your friend is the AH for selling the extra ticket without letting you get your +1 when other ppl got their +1s", "Being the odd one out sucks. I don\u2019t blame you. I would assume a TS concert would be a girls trip, too. I hope you can have fun regardless.

You made an assumption and got mad at your friend who is doing you a solid by hooking you up with better tickets than you were able to get. If you have a problem with it you still have tickets to use that you were able to get. She\u2019ll have no problem selling your ticket.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In my large friend group there is one husband who will randomly decide he MUST go to a girls only planned event so the others will invite their husbands so he is not alone. All the married and non-married girls get mad because we have to change plans for a couple who can\u2019t be apart \ud83d\ude44. That being said if they\u2019re bringing someone you bring someone too so you aren\u2019t the fifth wheel, because that is what is going to happen.", "NTA", "What does the other friend think?", "She purchased 6 tickets because that was the maximum, but there were only the 3 of us who planned on going. So needless to say she is not struggling financially. I was going to purchase 1 ticket from her. I also offered to help sell that ticket to someone else, if needed.", "Especially when a single friend is invited. Selling a ticket and bringing husband's so OP is all alone without giving her the opportunity to bring a friend is nasty.", "No need to shame someone\u2019s musical taste", "It definitely would be different if your husband was actually a taylor swift fan. By girls trip I just meant friends, as in a non-couples trip. No problem at all with men liking tswift or going to her concert in general", "Right?! My husband and I are going to the Taylor Swift concert together. I\u2019m more of a fan than he is, but he\u2019s excited to go anyway!", "The original plan was 3 women were going to concert. Friend decided to buy 6 tickets & now it\u2019s chaos.", "I know around 10 men who are attending the nearest one with their wives, girlfriends or SOs. Most are making a date weekend out of it. \n\nIF my husband and I end up winning tickets he will be attending with me as well.", "I wasn\u2019t mad at her, I just said I\u2019d use my 2 tickets instead so I\u2019m not 5th wheel. She is the one who got mad at me.", "She agrees with me and wanted a girls trip, but her husband and the other husband are close friends so she feels obligated if our other friend\u2019s husband goes, her\u2019s would too by default. Which is bogus, but she doesn\u2019t like conflict, so she is staying out of it.", "Oh totally NTA ... she\u2019s screwing up her own plan & wants to blame you. Tell her to bring whoever she wants. You have your own tix, you can meet them before or after or just do your own thing for the weekend.", "This isn't a debate sub.", "Because you come across as ungrateful and grumpy they want to being their husbands. If my tickets were for out of town my husband would have totally wanted to tag along to make a weekend of it. Dudes *can* enjoy a t swift concert.", "If her understanding was that this was to be a girls\u2019 trip but plans have changed, this seems resolvable.  It was going to be one, now it\u2019s not, the friend with five tickets should ask the person they sold one to if they want to buy a second. You take your two and take a friend.\nFeelings are hurt but you can move on with your friend having been a minor A H.\nNTA.", "Thats what I figured, but she got so upset.", "Married friend who bought tickets comes across as nasty and exclusionary to sell a ticket and assume OP would be fine as 5th wheel.", "Except the original plan was 3 women were going to concert. Friend decided to buy 6 tickets, invited husbands & sold 1 ticket. So OP was odd woman out", "Sounds like you both had expectations & both felt disappointed. That\u2019s pretty normal. Hopefully, she gets over it. Have fun at the concert!", "She was under the impression that was the plan, but there was never a plan. I guess it comes down to making the best of the situation for floor seats, or telling the friend thanks but no thanks now that the husbands are coming. \n\nAlso, I would think the price of the floor seats plus the price of the weekend away was incentive to invite the husbands. That\u2019s not a cheap weekend and they may have decided to take advantage of the time away by also inviting their spouses. But without any plans the friend isn\u2019t in the wrong for not being a mind reader."]}
