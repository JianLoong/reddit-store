It wasn't easy at all, but we made it work. My husband and I didn't get married until we were 25. By that point, we had 2 more children. \n\nLuna's been best friends with \"Caroline\" (16F) since they were in kindergarten. Caroline's mom, \"Stephanie\" and I have butted heads a few times over the years. When Stephanie met me and my husband, we weren't married and had 2 kids. She had an issue with us being unwed parents. My husband has always been hesitant to allow Caroline and Luna to be friends, afraid that Luna will become judgemental like Stephanie and her husband. The thing is, Caroline was always a very sweet girl. Super respectful and a great friend to Luna. We aren't opposed to our children learning opposite points of view, we just also don't want them to be judgemental and hateful, nor did we want anyone making them feel bad about their home life. Caroline didn't prove to be a bad influence. So, we never tried to stop them from being friends.\n\nOver the years, Caroline has turned into a very judgemental and hateful person. It's been sad to see. Even Luna has said she doesn't recognize her best friend anymore. Recently, Caroline announced that she's engaged to her boyfriend of 3 years (he's also 16). They're getting married in the summer, Stephanie and her husband, as well as the boyfriend's parents are signing off on it. They'll live on the boyfriend's parents property, finish up school and start working for the church. It's not something I agree with, but I didn't say anything. Caroline asked Luna to be her MOH and she agreed.\n\nThen I began to notice a change in Luna. She was super hostile towards myself and my husband. At first I thought it was teenage angst but then Luna began making comments about saving one's self for marriage, how premaritial sex is a sin, etc. One day, in the middle of an argument, she shouted that myself and my husband were going to hell because we had 3 children out of wedlock. Once everyone calmed down, we talked to her. Luna admitted that Caroline had got in her ear. She kept saying how unnatural our family was. Luna began crying and apologized, saying she didn't really believe it, she was just tired of Caroline constantly judging her. My husband and I gave her a hug and told her we understood. \n\nAfter much discussion, we decided that Luna shouldn't attend the wedding and should distance herself from Caroline for a bit. She was hesitant at first but ultimately agreed with us. She told Caroline. Stephanie then called me, screaming, saying that I was keeping the girls apart and ruining her daughter's wedding.

So you weren't adult enough to have a kid at 16, yet Caroline and her mom think she's adult enough to get married at 16? The religious views they have could very well mean they won't use birth control and she'll end up pregnant very young. A teenager getting pregnant is usually an accident. A teenager getting married before graduating high school and having both sets of parents on board is just bad parenting.", "NTA I don't understand why Stephanie is so upset, the girls aren't twin sisters or romantic partners. Separating them is perfectly fine.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you are a good parent and that Luna understands that it would be best to distance herself from her friend. You should block the mom\u2019s phone number though", "NTA. You and your husband were right to intervene. Your daughter is very young and may not yet understand that she is not obligated to maintain friendships with people who are hostile and judgemental towards her or her family. It certainly doesn't sound like she is enjoying her friendship with Caroline anymore, but she might not realize that she is allowed to step away from it. You simply gave her permission to do what she needed to do, for her own well-being.", "NTA, your daughter knew she had to lose her best friend and directed her emotions towards you guys. Good job parents, keep her far away from that family.", "NTA. I am very wary of religous groups that encourage teens to marry just so they can be free of \"premarital sin\" and who act like it's the greatest sin of all despite both of you being there for your child. As someone who was part of one of those groups, Caroline is obviously brainwashed and pushing her own anxieties on your daughter. I might allow her to go to the wedding, but I'd strongly advise her to eventually cut contact with this girl because her and her mother's behavior is allarming. Maybe sometime down the road, Luna can positively impact Caroline, but she doesn't deserve to be a punching bag for someone's bad home life.", "NTA - of course you need to keep her away from this type of hateful thinking. Keeping them apart is the right thing to do", "NTA", "NTA.

No sex before marriage, so get married at 16 so you can bone. Makes all the sense in the world.", "NTA", "YTA.   You try to clean this all up \"by she agreed with us\"... ehh if you really believed that to be the case, you wouldn't even be here. \n\nShe'll be 18 in 2  years, making her miss her best friend's wedding (and she's the MoH?) Yeah...this could blow up huge in your face.  \n\nI think you need to immediately tell your daughter that you felt judged and offended so you made a decision that wasn't yours to make. Explain how you feel (without being manipulative) tell her it is her choice.", "NTA\nYour daughter shouldn't participate in a child wedding anyways, because that's this is.", "NTA \n\nIf your daughter realised that Caroline is injecting her with the judgemental views and is ready to distance herself from her friend then it is really good for her.\n\n\nAlso I don't understand how getting married at 16 is okay!!!!!!!", "How unnatural your family is? What's truly unnatural is getting married at 16 just so you can bone! WTH? There is a 90% chance that they will be miserable within 2 years! They will want to be divorced, not sure if their parents will allow it... And hopefully Luna will see all of that happening!\n\nYou are NTA and the other girls mom is just mad because you took away a child she was trying to have her daughter brainwash.", "NTA. I know its a rough call for Luna, but there is no way her participation in this circus wasn't going to cause her more emotional pain in the long run.", "NTA. What parent would let their kid attend a CHILD WEDDING?? Engaged at 13? And Caroline is a terrible influence. \n\nCaroline's mother needs to be investigated because wtf is this", "NTA. Caroline and her family are hateful and judgemental and disguising it as \"religious.\" Luna agrees with you so you're not forcing her to do anything and she's allowed a choice in ending her friendship.", "Generally, I think parents telling their kids who they shouldn\u2019t or should be friends with is a bad idea, but in this case NTA. Also, it\u2019s super creepy that they are signing off on a 16 year old to get married. Sounds like a creepy arranged religious thing if you ask me", "NTA. This is in the best interest of your daughter and her mental health. It\u2019s hard when you see friends change so much, and it\u2019s hard to let them go. Luna is seeing that first hand.

I have a hard time understanding how you were mature enough at 16 to become a parent but also believe that your 16 year old isn\u2019t mature enough to pick her own friends.  This is a teachable moment to talk to your nearly adult daughter about what you believe & why, as well as about how people should treat each other. 16 is too late to try to keep your daughter away from people who disagree with your values. That decision is up to her.  Kids need all kinds of examples in their lives, and they will learn from both good & bad ones. A 16 year old getting married so she can have legal sex is about as bad an example you can think of.", "NTA. It sounds like Luna understands why distancing herself from Caroline is a good idea, and she agrees with your decision about not going to the wedding. You have legitimate reasons to want to keep them apart.", "NTA- Your daughter no longer wants to be friends with this person. Her indoctrination into the church has turned her hateful.

You discussed it with her and helped her see how her friend is not a real friend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm hesitant to blame her friend, even.

Your job as a parent is to protect your child.

Sounds very much like some fundamentalist/evangelical type of cult going on here.  Marrying them off as children does a good job to limit their futures drastically, keeping them in the control of the church so they have no experience of an actual life.  Also, keeps the females \"barefoot and pregnant\", dependent and controled, just like these patriarchal types prefer.\n\nHappy Cake Day!", "I don't think is about someone disagreeing with their values as much as someone constantly judging Luna and causing her anxiety.", "I didn't read where Op claimed she was mature enough to become parent.

Ain't no one with any maturity here at all.\n\nOP is angry and hurt about the friend and her family \"being judgemental\" that OP was a 16-year-old unwed mother, but doesn't actually think that her having had a kid at 16 (or three by the time she was 25) was a big deal. \n\nIn the meantime, she \"doesn't agree with\" a 16-year-old getting married (and rightly so) but doesn't see the hypocrisy, and doesn't have enough of a problem with it to keep her daughter from participating in a 16-year-old's wedding until she feels personally slighted. \n\nIn ALL of this, no one actually seems to care about what's best for these children, about teaching them that they have most of their lives to be adults, and that they don't need to be getting married OR having kids at 16 (and yes, I'm aware that 16-year-olds will have sex, I certainly did, but dear God, BIRTH CONTROL is a thing...why are they not teaching their children about BIRTH CONTROL? Or I don't know...masturbation?)\n\nESH.

So, I have a pretty good chance of being right.", "The only way that marriage is gonna \"last\" is because Caroline is gonna be told that giving up when it becomes obvious to her later on that this was a horrible idea(it is) is a horrid sin and against God's will.\n\nAnd yes kids who do this are absolutely getting married so they can bone without judgment, not because they are actually mature enough to be married. \n\nIf the wedding was closer than summer, it would most likely be followed by the birth of a very healthy weight premie who miraculously didn't have to stay in NICU", "As someone who \\*does\\* know them...it is either because they want to have sex or they were caught having sex. That is very common in their religion. I rule out they're pregnant, only because Caroline would be very far along by the time the wedding occurred and that'd defeat the purpose of a shotgun wedding.", "Why else would they marry at 16?? \n\n>Even know how long their marriage will last\n\nThe possibilities for this marriage to last are very slim. It's possible, but highly unlikely that it will be a succesful marriage. But the problem isn't so much that as the fact that since they are cuckoo about their religion, they probably won't get divorced because it will be a sin or some other crap like that", "I think having a kid at 16 is a terrible decision. I think getting married at 16 is a terrible decision.  OP's response to my views about 16 year old parents would probably be 1) it's none of my business what she did, and 2) it worked out fine. If she doesn't think that I or Caroline's parents have the right to judge her for having a baby at 16, then I don't see how she has the right to judge Caroline for getting married at 16. As for how Caroline treats Luna, Luna still has to make the decision about what she will put up with from her friends. If she was 6, I would agree that her parents should step in & take control. But she's 16. It's time for her to make her own decisions. Parents banning their almost adult teenagers from seeing their friends doesn't have a great track record for success.", "I never said that it wasn't a big deal that I had a baby at 16. I would not recommend anyone going through what I did. It wasn't easy whatsoever and we struggled a lot. Things worked out in the end and we are very lucky, but that doesn't mean that others will. What I don't think is a big deal, is having children out of wedlock. I don't think us having our other two children is a big deal, as we were older when they were born (21 when we had our son, 24 when we had our youngest daughter) and were in a better place vs 16, in high school, etc. \n\nWe also chose to wait to get married because we knew 16 was too young to tie ourselves down permanently. We were together, but if we broke up, we would only have to worry about working out custody of our daughter (and later, other two children) vs all the mess that comes with divorce.\n\nI also have taught my children about birth control and my oldest daughter is on the pill, as I'd rather her not follow in my footsteps. I wish Caroline's parents would have the safe sex talk with her and get her on the pill, but that's their house and their business and I can't control that.", "I'm not well versed on all the religions of the world, but I'm pretty sure that most of the ones that push no premarital sex also push no birth control.", "They did talked to her and she saw how bad Caroline made her feel. The post isn't about Luna being upset that she didn't go to the wedding, it's about that religious nut, that just like the rest of her church pals, is a judgemental awful person and called op to insult her.", "My money is on pregnancy. Shotgun wedding", "People literally got married at 16 for centuries.  My mom was married at 16 to my dad who had just turned 18 and that was only the 70s.  Considering, over 50% of marriages end in divorce, yeah you have a good chance of being right but not because they didn't spend the their 20s fucking random people from tinder first.", ">how she has the right to judge Caroline for getting married at 16\n\nShe clearly said she was okay with it, and even if it's not something she agrees with, she never once gave her opinion on the matter. They only saod no to luna going at the wedding when they saw how bad she treats their daughter. \n\n Op said Luna agreed to them and that she feels bad everytime Caroline attacks her. Honestly, i wouldn't have left them be friends with a religious nut from the bwggining, but Op let them be friends until caroline caused her daughter anxiety.", "I doubt it's a shotgun wedding as it's not until June and it's only February now, they got engaged last month. She'd be very pregnant come wedding day. But I do agree, it's either they want to have sex or were caught having sex and now their parents feel they \\*have\\* to get married.", ">because they didn't spend the their 20s fucking random people from tinder first.\n\nIt's not about \"fucking random people\" is about having life experience. Maturity, a job. \n\nAnd just because your mom was a child bride it doesn't make it any less disgusting. People got married at 16 for centuries, true and maybe even younger. But the purpose of marriage then wasn't conjugal happiness, it was politics. Literally no one was concerned with the bride's happiness. Just because something happened in the past doesn't mean it's a good thing."]}
