By that point, we had 2 more children. \n\nLuna's been best friends with \"Caroline\" (16F) since they were in kindergarten. Caroline's mom, \"Stephanie\" and I have butted heads a few times over the years. When Stephanie met me and my husband, we weren't married and had 2 kids. She had an issue with us being unwed parents. My husband has always been hesitant to allow Caroline and Luna to be friends, afraid that Luna will become judgemental like Stephanie and her husband. The thing is, Caroline was always a very sweet girl. Super respectful and a great friend to Luna. We aren't opposed to our children learning opposite points of view, we just also don't want them to be judgemental and hateful, nor did we want anyone making them feel bad about their home life. Caroline didn't prove to be a bad influence. So, we never tried to stop them from being friends.\n\nOver the years, Caroline has turned into a very judgemental and hateful person. It's been sad to see. Even Luna has said she doesn't recognize her best friend anymore. Recently, Caroline announced that she's engaged to her boyfriend of 3 years (he's also 16). They're getting married in the summer, Stephanie and her husband, as well as the boyfriend's parents are signing off on it.

Caroline asked Luna to be her MOH and she agreed.\n\nThen I began to notice a change in Luna. She was super hostile towards myself and my husband. At first I thought it was teenage angst but then Luna began making comments about saving one's self for marriage, how premaritial sex is a sin, etc. One day, in the middle of an argument, she shouted that myself and my husband were going to hell because we had 3 children out of wedlock. Once everyone calmed down, we talked to her. Luna admitted that Caroline had got in her ear. She kept saying how unnatural our family was. Luna began crying and apologized, saying she didn't really believe it, she was just tired of Caroline constantly judging her. My husband and I gave her a hug and told her we understood. \n\nAfter much discussion, we decided that Luna shouldn't attend the wedding and should distance herself from Caroline for a bit.

So you weren't adult enough to have a kid at 16, yet Caroline and her mom think she's adult enough to get married at 16?

This is a teachable moment to talk to your nearly adult daughter about what you believe & why, as well as about how people should treat each other. 16 is too late to try to keep your daughter away from people who disagree with your values.

What I don't think is a big deal, is having children out of wedlock.

We were together, but if we broke up, we would only have to worry about working out custody of our daughter (and later, other two children) vs all the mess that comes with divorce.\n\nI also have taught my children about birth control and my oldest daughter is on the pill, as I'd rather her not follow in my footsteps.

Fuck that shit you need to set your daughter straight and let her know what's right and what's wrong and that Carol and her demented family is on the spectrum of everything wrong, fucking hell", "NTA", "Sounds like you are good parents to Luna. You let her be part of the discussion of not going to the wedding.", "NTA to keep your daughter away from ideological Chernobyl", "The parents being fine with this is so shocking to me.  I went to high school with a kid who was a peripheral part of our friend group ... he got married at 18 to his 16yo girlfriend and the families were so pleased.", "Unfortunately this crap is totally legal in a lot of states (I think most states actually) if the parents sign off on it. So there's nothing to investigate... just keep your own kids away from that influence if you can.", "Being in a cult that advocates for child marriage is what makes it ok, obviously. /s", "About the purity thing, and based on what OP said about how they were being berated for premarital sex and all that, I honestly wonder if Caroline is getting married at sixteen just so she can have sex with her boyfriend.", "I\u2019m dying to know the religion. This is beyond southern Baptist\u2026 this sounds borderline fundamentalist, especially using terms like \u201cunnatural\u201d in reference to a family unit that wasn\u2019t created in \u201ctraditional\u201d order. \n\n\nNTA, btw. I can see throughout your entire story that you and your husband found yourselves in a shitty situation, tried your hardest, and beat the odds. I don\u2019t see anywhere that you\u2019re green flagging teen pregnancy, let alone teen marriage, but you\u2019re not idiots, and have prepared your children for LIFE. Not the sheltered existence that has turned Caroline in to who she is now. \n\n\nGood on ya, Mama.", "Still fucked up tbh", "In my culture, people used to be super religious, but the Church went so overboard with the power trip that people actually distanced themselves from religion. Now most children are actually born out of wedlock. And the parents often don't bother ever getting married.", "It happens, and it\u2019s truly sad.", "Very likely", "Can you read? Her daughter literally agreed that it would be best if she didn\u2019t attend the wedding. Nothing was \u201cforced\u201d upon her", "[deleted]", "Well, considering the life expectancy being so short, it probably made more sense then. Plus, most people were probably doing manual labor and apprenticeship, not going to college for 4 years and then getting a mortgage. I bet a lot more 18 years old could earn a living then than now.", "Yeah and they also had a life expectancy of what, like 45?", "Ironically life expectancy was short partly because they tried to make underdeveloped girls give birth and raise children they weren't equipped to handle"]}
