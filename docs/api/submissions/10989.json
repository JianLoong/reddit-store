By that point, we had 2 more children. \n\nLuna's been best friends with \"Caroline\" (16F) since they were in kindergarten. Caroline's mom, \"Stephanie\" and I have butted heads a few times over the years. When Stephanie met me and my husband, we weren't married and had 2 kids. She had an issue with us being unwed parents. My husband has always been hesitant to allow Caroline and Luna to be friends, afraid that Luna will become judgemental like Stephanie and her husband. The thing is, Caroline was always a very sweet girl. Super respectful and a great friend to Luna. We aren't opposed to our children learning opposite points of view, we just also don't want them to be judgemental and hateful, nor did we want anyone making them feel bad about their home life. Caroline didn't prove to be a bad influence. So, we never tried to stop them from being friends.\n\nOver the years, Caroline has turned into a very judgemental and hateful person. It's been sad to see. Even Luna has said she doesn't recognize her best friend anymore. Recently, Caroline announced that she's engaged to her boyfriend of 3 years (he's also 16). They're getting married in the summer, Stephanie and her husband, as well as the boyfriend's parents are signing off on it. They'll live on the boyfriend's parents property, finish up school and start working for the church. It's not something I agree with, but I didn't say anything. Caroline asked Luna to be her MOH and she agreed.\n\nThen I began to notice a change in Luna. She was super hostile towards myself and my husband. At first I thought it was teenage angst but then Luna began making comments about saving one's self for marriage, how premaritial sex is a sin, etc. One day, in the middle of an argument, she shouted that myself and my husband were going to hell because we had 3 children out of wedlock. Once everyone calmed down, we talked to her. Luna admitted that Caroline had got in her ear. She kept saying how unnatural our family was. Luna began crying and apologized, saying she didn't really believe it, she was just tired of Caroline constantly judging her. My husband and I gave her a hug and told her we understood. \n\nAfter much discussion, we decided that Luna shouldn't attend the wedding and should distance herself from Caroline for a bit. She was hesitant at first but ultimately agreed with us. She told Caroline. Stephanie then called me, screaming, saying that I was keeping the girls apart and ruining her daughter's wedding.

So you weren't adult enough to have a kid at 16, yet Caroline and her mom think she's adult enough to get married at 16?

This is a teachable moment to talk to your nearly adult daughter about what you believe & why, as well as about how people should treat each other. 16 is too late to try to keep your daughter away from people who disagree with your values.

What I don't think is a big deal, is having children out of wedlock.

We were together, but if we broke up, we would only have to worry about working out custody of our daughter (and later, other two children) vs all the mess that comes with divorce.\n\nI also have taught my children about birth control and my oldest daughter is on the pill, as I'd rather her not follow in my footsteps.

They believe that disobedience and refusal to repent will get you thrown into the lowest level of heaven, which is still heaven, so that wouldn\u2019t make any sense. This sounded more southern Baptist to me?  The Mormons I know would be horrified at two teenagers getting married.

While it does work out, there\u2019s more like you that work out. I think that whole 16 and pregnant means automatically get married is wrong. There\u2019s got to be a sense of being trapped when they marry right away. While it\u2019s not impossible to divorce, it\u2019s still harder if a person decides they are with the wrong person. You guys stuck it out and seen who each other is by waiting. Then eventually you decided they were still your \u201cforever love\u201d. But divorce is so much harder if you decide he/she wasn\u2019t the one after all. It\u2019s not a bad thing they separate, it\u2019s just easier without needing to divorce as well. In my opinion, 16 is just too young to understand what a commitment marriage is. On the flip side, I have only known one couple that it worked out for. A former coworker parents divorced when she was 13. She missed her happy home life so her and her boyfriend got pregnant and she was married with a baby by 14. She never divorced or separated. When I left the job, she was 64 and had already been married for 50 years and they were still very much in love. They got pregnant so they could get married.

My mother had both of my sisters out of wedlock, do I think she is going to hell and god hates her because of it. HELL NO! God gave us free will, he knew we would make mistakes.
