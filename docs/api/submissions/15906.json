I had to wait a few years until I had a nice job that paid well and started sending money to my family in Venezuela. It started sending like 100 dollars a month to help my mom and brothers, 100 dollars is a lot of money there, so I thought it would be enough.\n\nOver the years I got married to an American man, and our joined finances got us into a better place economically. During the pandemic my mom said that wanted to do repairs, a new kitchen and a new patio since our patio was made out of dirt and was tired of dealing with dirty at the house for over 20 years. I gladly accepted, asked for budget, and started sending money, about 500 dollars a month, but then she kept increasing her plans like getting a big water tank (they cut the watter a lot in there) and a device to protect the electricity inside the house, and those came with more costs because they needed to build something to put the water tank on and redo almost the entire house electricity wiring. So I ended up sending them about 1000 dollars a month.\n\nSo, I decided to visit Venezuela with my husband. When we arrived to my childhood home, I was extremely disappointed, I found out that they only build a room and a half, got a water tank that they keep in the patio, and the patio is still full of dirt. After the initial shock I scolded my mom and requested to know what have they done with my money, but she didn't give me a straight answer, she only said \"I've been sick, things are expensive, etc\" then my younger brother came back home, he came in a new motorcycle, shirtless and barefoot, in the back there was his girlfriend (that I knew nothing about) and their little son (whom I also knew nothing) they has been living there. My older brother was at university and seems like he got a new car. There were liquor bottles all over the kitchen it seems like they had a party a few days ago. My mom was carrying a fucking iPhone and had a full new wardrobe. This was so embarrassing to witness in front of my husband. I yelled at all of them and told them I would send them nothing from now on, since they have been wasting all my money.\n\nWe are still in Venezuela and decided to visit the P\u00e1ramo, but my entire extended family is so mad at me, my mom says I'm a bad daughter because she had to sacrifice a lot to raise me up and my brothers, my brother with a child says that I'll kill his son if I cut the money because he can't afford anything with his Venezuelan salary, other family members say I'm a bad daughter for scolding my own mom. My husband says that I'm doing nothing wrong, and they are leeching on me. I'm angry at them but I don't know if I'm being irrational. Some Venezuelan friends in the US has told me that this is common and I should have seen it coming, they themselves don't send a single dollar to their families for this reason.\n\nETA: My older brother works at the university, is not a student.

So you really have two options, prioritize your immediate family and yourself or prioritize the rapport you have with you family back in Venezuela.
