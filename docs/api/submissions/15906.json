I had to wait a few years until I had a nice job that paid well and started sending money to my family in Venezuela. It started sending like 100 dollars a month to help my mom and brothers, 100 dollars is a lot of money there, so I thought it would be enough.\n\nOver the years I got married to an American man, and our joined finances got us into a better place economically. During the pandemic my mom said that wanted to do repairs, a new kitchen and a new patio since our patio was made out of dirt and was tired of dealing with dirty at the house for over 20 years. I gladly accepted, asked for budget, and started sending money, about 500 dollars a month, but then she kept increasing her plans like getting a big water tank (they cut the watter a lot in there) and a device to protect the electricity inside the house, and those came with more costs because they needed to build something to put the water tank on and redo almost the entire house electricity wiring. So I ended up sending them about 1000 dollars a month.\n\nSo, I decided to visit Venezuela with my husband. When we arrived to my childhood home, I was extremely disappointed, I found out that they only build a room and a half, got a water tank that they keep in the patio, and the patio is still full of dirt. After the initial shock I scolded my mom and requested to know what have they done with my money, but she didn't give me a straight answer, she only said \"I've been sick, things are expensive, etc\" then my younger brother came back home, he came in a new motorcycle, shirtless and barefoot, in the back there was his girlfriend (that I knew nothing about) and their little son (whom I also knew nothing) they has been living there. My older brother was at university and seems like he got a new car. There were liquor bottles all over the kitchen it seems like they had a party a few days ago. My mom was carrying a fucking iPhone and had a full new wardrobe. This was so embarrassing to witness in front of my husband. I yelled at all of them and told them I would send them nothing from now on, since they have been wasting all my money.\n\nWe are still in Venezuela and decided to visit the P\u00e1ramo, but my entire extended family is so mad at me, my mom says I'm a bad daughter because she had to sacrifice a lot to raise me up and my brothers, my brother with a child says that I'll kill his son if I cut the money because he can't afford anything with his Venezuelan salary, other family members say I'm a bad daughter for scolding my own mom. My husband says that I'm doing nothing wrong, and they are leeching on me. I'm angry at them but I don't know if I'm being irrational. Some Venezuelan friends in the US has told me that this is common and I should have seen it coming, they themselves don't send a single dollar to their families for this reason.\n\nETA: My older brother works at the university, is not a student. I didn't even had a chance to see him. My younger brother is 25 years old.", "created_utc": 1682696988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131yi8h/aita_for_cutting_financial_support_for_my_family/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All so they could live it up in the moment instead of making the promised home improvements.\n\nThe only reason you know any of this is because you went there and saw it for yourself - they were not ever going to tell you what was really going on.

You have no obligaiton to be the family breadwinner especially countries away. Especially when they're lying to you about the use of those funds. Cut them off immediately. If a while down the road you still feel conflicted in a year or so, maybe have the conversation with your mother about sending a certain amount of money, no more no less and completely on your terms and up to your discretion. That would even be too nice in my opinion for how they've treated your and your husbands generosity thus far.", "NTA. You got played.", "NTA\n\nYou sent them a lot of your resources out of the goodness of your own heart for essentials, and they used it to live above their means and stop fending for themselves. \n\nThey sr*wed you over really bad. It was sneaky, dishonest, disrespectful, greedy, nefarious, etc; just so they can be lazy and wasteful. I would cut them off too, but I'm sure there is a specific dynamic for families where one person moves to an economically stable country from an economically unstable country that I'm ignorant to. \n\nBottom line though is that you helped them so that they can live a secure life and they used your help to live a life of luxury while their foundation remained unstable. This is actually quite common for people who live in poverty, and that is exactly what makes them a bottomless money pit. Question is whether you want to pour more into it, and how much you buy into your cultures family above all else mentality. \n\nChoice is yours, what anyone tells you will stem from their culture and circumstances. The important thing is that your conscience is clear.", "NTA", "NTA.\nI'm also from Venezuela and had to cut off support for some of my family after it became clear they were just leeches with no intention of ever changing.\n\nSome people have poverty in their brain and unfortunately many that are left in Venezuela are like that.

It's embarrassing af but not your fault.\n\nEsto me dio una arrechera extrema y pena ajena de otro nivel.\n\nCut them the fuck off.", "NTA Good to know that money and family is still a sticky situation even in other cultures, I think you should do what you are comfortable with as it sounds like you are being taken advantage of.", "Venezuelan here. NTA. Why would they spend the money in such stupid way. If they wanted to get out of the country they had a golden ticket with your connections and now they are without that and a caring sister/daughter.", "NTA \n\nYour family are akin to villains from Atlas Shrugged. I'm thinking of Rearden's mother and younger brother.", "NTA\n\n\"He can't afford anything with his venezuelan sallary\"\n\nThen they can all sell their Iphones, Motorcycle, new car, and new wardrobe, you know...the things they don't need to survive??", "This shit never works out. You want to financially help someone? Attach conditions. Pay whatever bill or landlord directly. And scrutinize everything. Set a time limit that never exceeds three months. That's if you MUST financially help someone. In this case the correct amount of money you should've sent after leaving is $0. I'm sorry, OP, but ESH, your Venezuelan friends are right, you should've seen this coming, especially at 41.

If your mom had called you saying, \"Your brother was in a horrible car wreck and we need a lot of money for his surgery,\" and you hda scrounged to dig up the cash for his medical bills only to find out that your family lied, your brother was fine, and they spent the money on a new car ... that would be a massive problem. But your complaint seems to be, \"My mother asked me for money for nice things she wanted. I sent it to her. Then she bought only some of the nice things she had initially asked for, and spent the rest of the money on other nice things.\"  I truly don't understand why you're so upset by this. You also seem angry that you weren't made aware of what's going on in your brother's life ... his girlfriend, his child, etc. I can see being angry and/or hurt by this (I would be), but I don't understand what this has to do with the money issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
