I had to wait a few years until I had a nice job that paid well and started sending money to my family in Venezuela. It started sending like 100 dollars a month to help my mom and brothers, 100 dollars is a lot of money there, so I thought it would be enough.\n\nOver the years I got married to an American man, and our joined finances got us into a better place economically. During the pandemic my mom said that wanted to do repairs, a new kitchen and a new patio since our patio was made out of dirt and was tired of dealing with dirty at the house for over 20 years. I gladly accepted, asked for budget, and started sending money, about 500 dollars a month, but then she kept increasing her plans like getting a big water tank (they cut the watter a lot in there) and a device to protect the electricity inside the house, and those came with more costs because they needed to build something to put the water tank on and redo almost the entire house electricity wiring. So I ended up sending them about 1000 dollars a month.\n\nSo, I decided to visit Venezuela with my husband. When we arrived to my childhood home, I was extremely disappointed, I found out that they only build a room and a half, got a water tank that they keep in the patio, and the patio is still full of dirt. After the initial shock I scolded my mom and requested to know what have they done with my money, but she didn't give me a straight answer, she only said \"I've been sick, things are expensive, etc\" then my younger brother came back home, he came in a new motorcycle, shirtless and barefoot, in the back there was his girlfriend (that I knew nothing about) and their little son (whom I also knew nothing) they has been living there. My older brother was at university and seems like he got a new car. There were liquor bottles all over the kitchen it seems like they had a party a few days ago. My mom was carrying a fucking iPhone and had a full new wardrobe. This was so embarrassing to witness in front of my husband. I yelled at all of them and told them I would send them nothing from now on, since they have been wasting all my money.\n\nWe are still in Venezuela and decided to visit the P\u00e1ramo, but my entire extended family is so mad at me, my mom says I'm a bad daughter because she had to sacrifice a lot to raise me up and my brothers, my brother with a child says that I'll kill his son if I cut the money because he can't afford anything with his Venezuelan salary, other family members say I'm a bad daughter for scolding my own mom. My husband says that I'm doing nothing wrong, and they are leeching on me. I'm angry at them but I don't know if I'm being irrational. Some Venezuelan friends in the US has told me that this is common and I should have seen it coming, they themselves don't send a single dollar to their families for this reason.\n\nETA: My older brother works at the university, is not a student.

Sabe que no es suficiente y por eso tiene otras formas de ganar dinero al mes (hace de Yummy que es como taxi por las noches) tambi\u00e9n gana dinero por internet. Al final tiene un ingreso superior a 600$ y yo tambi\u00e9n gano mi dinero, tenemos muchos gastos y cada quien vive a\u00fan con su familia aportando a su hogar. Estamos casi justos pero es por nuestro estilo de vida. \nEn Venezuela los \u00fanicos que se pueden quejar del dinero son los empleados p\u00fablicos y a\u00fan as\u00ed es absurdo no buscar un segundo o tercer empleo. \n\n100$ en Venezuela NO ES NADA. Pero eso no es tu problema. Con 200$ al mes es suficiente para gastos en comida y cosas muy b\u00e1sicas para dos personas (sin incluir lujos, salidas, si no pagan alquiler porque la casa es propia pues est\u00e1 bien, la luz es casi gratis, el agua tambi\u00e9n, el internet solo es caro si no tienen cantv porque obvio hay mejores servicios).

You are right", "nta", "NTA\n\nA lot of people got burned this way. Best thing is only send money directly to schools and clinics.

Mandalos pal carajo y que se vayan a mamar un huevo!\n\nYeah, sadly your family was using your money and you to keep the good life without having to work. They lied to you and, even if they don't like it, there must be consequences for their lies.\n\nSadly, lies are something common and not frown upon in the Venezuelan culture. So, for your family, you are the asshole because lies are not an issue, and in their mind, your mom did what needed to be done, which is to lie to you.\n\nIf your family keeps bitching, tell them they can go the same path you did to obtain your current economical condition.", "NTA they were just using you and I\u2019m so sorry", "NTA\n\nThey essentially lied about how they were using the money and why they wanted more. Also the fact that no one told you that you had a nephew is really weird. They clearly stopped treating you like family and only see you as an ATM. I would stop sending them money, let them learn to be more responsible and take care of themselves because they haven't shown you they deserve your help.

More power to you, NTA", "NTA\n\nYou'll have to decide what to do, but from my experience,  when people are really lacking, they sometimes make impulse decisions when they do have money.  My family supports a family in another country as well. There have been times when  they have spent money very differently than I would have wanted (and than than what they said the money was for) and I've felt used.   You might consider paying for things differently. For example, paying for a food allotment at a store, paying school fees directly, or paying for work after it is completed and you have pictures.   Some relatives abroad will take in younger extended family members to get a better education when they are old enough.  \n\nGood luck as you sort it out. I think the dilemma is pretty common", "NTA. I cant even begin to imagine what you're feeling and how hurt you are. Your mom really wants to go there and call you a bad daughter? What about your brother?
