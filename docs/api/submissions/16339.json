The point was still good.", "ESH - she shouldn\u2019t have said anything, but you didn\u2019t need to be so awful about it either.\n\nI\u2019m a high school drop out. I got my GED, did my BA, moved on to MA and then had to stop prior to graduating with my MA for the same health reasons that stopped me from graduating HS.

I have master and all my siblings went to university but all of us and most of my cousins if wanted wise advice asked for advice from my grandma who had only primary school education! (Beautiful soul and wise person).\n\nAnd every advice she gave was in good faith and well thought! Putting someone down because he/she doesn't have formal education is AH in my eyes. \n\nIf SM was using bad words or anything similar I might say snap was in place, but if it's worded as OP wrote, that is just awful way to put person down just because you don't like someone's advice! Adult and \"educated\" person listen and make own decisions without being mean. \n\nOP YTA just because you have luck and determination to follow degree, doesn't mean that people who have less education are stupid and can't give advice. ( Nobody says you have to follow advice but being mean in response is just AH move)!!!", "It wasn't advice though?

It\u2019s usually offensive because it\u2019s usually said in a condescending way. OP said it in such a way as to imply that stepmom is too stupid to have a decent opinion because she\u2019s a drop out. My husband dropped out because his dad became too ill to work and they were going to lose their house and not be able to pay for his dad\u2019s medical care without him working. He later was able to get a GED and get into the trades. Even without his diploma, he was able to have a career that makes enough to allow me to stay home with our kids. OP was wrong to imply that just because some doesn\u2019t have a piece of paper means that they\u2019re uneducated or not intelligent."]}
