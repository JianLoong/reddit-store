You were right to put her in her place. There is no nice way to say you don't know what you're talking about so that's why I don't agree with those saying ESH. She made a smart offhanded and yes uneducated comment about something she knows little about which tells me there was some snipe behind it.", "NTA, but your step siblings are just defending their mom.", "As a biology student trust me business  degree will get you much more than biology\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about but l don\u2019t mention the highschl degree thing because we shouldn\u2019t look down on them cause there\u2019s nothing wrong with it either. You should\u2019ve just snapped and told her to back off without mentioning it. Soooo ESH but mainly not the a-hole. Your step siblings reacted correctly I would be pissed asf too. Never look down on someone for their education level", "Mostly NTA, but with a dash of ESH. Her comments were unquestionably inappropriate and unwanted and you had every right to stand up for yourself, but you could easily have defended your degree choice without insulting her for not having finished high school. It does kind of reek of \"I'm better than you because I'm going to college, so know your place.\" Your step-siblings being angry at you for dragging their mother over her education level is justified. Again, though, what she said was also not okay, so snapping is somewhat understandable.", "NTA. But if not because she has no degree of her own, though your point isn't invalid on doing level. It's that she is determining it as useless. Way too negative and not true. Hey kids are just defending their mom", "NTA, not her life.  As for the steps, block them.", "ESH you could have said it in a nicer way unless\nshe is constantly making comments about it and your education.", "NTA - She wasn\u2019t concerned for you. She was trying to belittle your degree choice. A concerned parent doesn\u2019t try to guilt their kids for their choices when they\u2019re not even supporting them financially.", "ESH. She was out of line but that was a low blow in your part.", "NTA. And not to be a dick to the bio majors, buts not exactly a lucrative field unless your lucky. While a business degree\u2026 that can get you some, and decently quick. Depending what your jumping into.", "ESH. Her comment was crappy but your response was a straight up personal attack on her education or lack thereof. Your step sibs are standing up for their mom and are the least AH's in this situation.", "ESH. She could have expressed her concerns about your major in a polite way. As for you, just because she didn\u2019t graduate from high school doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t have an opinion. You could  have challenged her point like an intelligent person rather than resort to a childish insult.", "NTA\n\nShe really shouldn\u2019t comment for a few reasons\u2026.\n\n1. She\u2019s a step mother \n\n2. She didn\u2019t even graduate high school\u2026.why would she think her opinion about college degrees matter\u2026.?\n\n3. You didn\u2019t ask\n\n\nIt\u2019s good your father took your side. His wife was ridiculously out of line", "ESH", "Not a A hole for defending self. Probably a bit of an A hole for belittling her for dropping out.", "YTA\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have commented on your degree choice, it\u2019s difficult to study a degree that you don\u2019t enjoy. Ultimately, it is your decision and your future. \n\nHowever, snapping and calling her a High School drop seems pretty uncalled for. I don\u2019t know your relationship with her but it seems like a simple conversation and an agreement to disagree could have solved this pretty quickly", "ESH.", "ESH...\n\nbut I find it interesting the way the family is split on whether or not you're an A H.", "Honestly she sounded concerned and worried for your future with the degree you chose, I doubt that comment was malicious, although she should not have said it. But your response was cruel.", "ESH\n\nShe was over the line, and then so were you. Sounds like a fun dinner", "WTF. You all had a massive overreaction to a rather innocuous comment. It sounds like she was just expressing concern for you, sure your don't have to agree with it and maybe it's something she didn't need to say, but damn it was one comment and you could have expressed pushed back on it without insults and condescension.

For the matter of fact i think you will have more opportunities as a businesswoman than a biologist.", "This\u2026 not sure where she thinks all the bio majors are getting employed.

She needs to keep her nose out of it, but unless this has been something she\u2019s being doing a lot, OP\u2019s reaction was pretty mean and over the top.", "I will admit that my comment towards her was uncalled for . But I was angry and had enough", "The second point makes no sense. Yes, she could have asked. She didn\u2019t need to be judge mental or even involved. \n\nBut stating she can\u2019t ask since she doesn\u2019t have a degree, that\u2019s really a bit arrogant. So no one will answer to an aita when not a certified relationship counselor/therapist? \n\nESH. Snapping at stepmom; I totally get it. Snapping with a rant on her high schoolpast? Not necessary and too hurtful. \u2018Mind your own business\u2019 could have been enough. \n\nAnd the other kids: they are just protecting their mam. Caused by your insults.

That's not even debatable. But I do agree op shouldn't have said what she said.", "She was rude, but you responded with a very personal attack that wasn\u2019t called for. Yes, her questioning your choices wasn\u2019t kind or necessary, but you basically called her stupid and uneducated in response, which was taking it too far.", "A lack of formal education doesn't automatically mean that someone doesn't have common sense, intelligence, or real life experience or that they aren't well-read or self-taught.", "Eh, from this comment it seems that you may be the AH. Judging family based on their formal education is beyond pretentious.\n\nFrom this comment, it seems like you may be continually disrespectful towards people who didn\u2019t get their degrees. There are other ways to make a living, or become educated, than through a university diploma."]}
