Her husband has some unexplained medical issues that are being investigated but he cannot work, her long term job reduced her hours so she had to find another job and work two jobs to make ends meet. They have two kids. One from his first marriage and one from hers. Her stepdaughter is 9 and her son is 8. The husband spends twice a week where he's not in the house going to various appointments (PT, doctors, psychology) over the medical trouble he's having. But even when he's home he's sleeping more and struggles to move around so they don't feel safe having him home alone with the kids.\n\nThe reason nobody wants to babysit is the kids do not get along. She has asked about doing the two days he's at appointments but that is still too much. The kids don't want to be in the same room, they fight about everything and anything, her stepdaughter gets regular notes home from her teacher over yelling at the teacher or other children who say she has a brother. My nephew tries to walk home from school instead of being picked up with his stepsister or taking the bus. I babysat for them on a couple of occasions and I had an easier time managing my 3 kids under 3. The house was not as tense, there wasn't the same level of fighting and I wasn't getting dirty looks or even called names over it. I never wanted to experience that again so I said no. My parents and brother have all seen the kids interact at family gatherings and do not want to be in charge of that. My brother said he'd be half afraid something would happen or someone would run off and he'd be in a shitload of trouble. My niece is 19 and she doesn't feel good about it either, and my sister REALLY laid the guilt trip on her. She's told us no babysitter she can afford will do it and the ones who would do it are out of their budget.\n\nShe started shaming us in recent weeks over it. But went extra hard on my niece because she's bouncing from PT job to PT job right now and she's not in school. I called her out for it and said she cannot expect us to grin and bear the fighting and difficulty her kids present when she and her husband have always pretended there's nothing wrong between the kids. This is something she and her husband have done the last 18 months they've been married. They have heard the kids call each other terrible names and say they wish the other was dead and she'll say they love each other and are such typical siblings. Yes, siblings fight, but these kids truly hate each other and wish the other harm.\n\nAnyway, my sister did not like being called out and she said we were letting her down when she needed us the most.

You did the right thing.\n\nThings are hard, but she is not entitled to other people's labor (and watching kids is labor). Narrowing down on a relatively young family member and shaming them is very manipulative. Your calling out of your sister has helpedyour niece to resist manipulations.\n\nAlso, where are baby mommy and baby daddy from previous marriages? Have they been tapped for help?", "NTA\n\nIt's one thing to ask for babysitting in times of difficulty when the babysitting will be reasonably straightforward to provide not with two WARRING step siblings, it's a much much bigger ask.\n\nThe fact that no one in the family is willing to take that on is a clear message of how bad the two kids are.\n\nAre any of the family in a financial position to be able to contribute to paying for babysitting? Not that any of you are obliged to do that, just wondered if it might be an option. \n\nI sense you want to help but having to handle the behaviour of and responsibility for those two kids as they are being right now is the sticking point.", "Info: why the kids have to be together? It's not like they are going to miss each other.", "NTA.  It's not your fault the kids don't get along, not your fault the father is having health issues, and not your fault for defending your niece. They're clearly a family in distress and it's not on you to fix their internal dynamics. I bet the kids actions are likely a result of internal strife and they're acting out due to it.\n\nNow, you certainly can be sympathetic and put yourself out there to help your sister out sometimes (if you want to). Your sister shouldn't be guilt tripping anyone and should come with humility if she wants help.", "NTA. it's a lesson for your sister-- if her kids are unchecked terrors with no discipline, no one will want to be around them.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister is in dire need of the truth. Are the other parents of each child still involved in rearing their children? Has your sister considered taking the children to therapy?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds as if the parents can\u2019t handle their own kids. It\u2019s a lot to expect a babysitter to do what the parents can\u2019t.\n\nAny possibility of someone, maybe the niece, taking one of the kids out of the family home to their own home and babysitting one of them there?\n\nWith just one kid it might be doable. And then the dad would have the childcare burden cut in half.\n\nBecause I think it\u2019s time the parents started thinking outside the box for childcare instead of getting angry at family who have a valid reason for refusing.", "I'm sure this will be an unpopular opinion but it sounds like forcing these two children to live in a household together is abusive! They hate each other... It's that simple! Without a shit ton of therapy nothing is happening positive in this family! You are NTA and nobody should be forced to watch those kids together if that's how they get along.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s no one\u2019s responsibility to babysit, yes it takes a village, but the village needs to actually want to do it. A resentful village isn\u2019t good. They\u2019re ignoring very serious issues that are only going to get worse, and everyone in the family needs to be honest with them. Refusing to acknowledge problems and trying to ignore them into going away never works, and is truly such an idiotic and lazy idea. \n\nEven without all that, you would still not be an asshole for not wanting to babysit. If they can\u2019t afford proper care, then they need to figure it out. I\u2019m sure proper care would be easier to find if they tried even a little bit to settle the issues with their kids.", "She and her husband let those children down.\n\nNTA", "Wow, your sister is clearly struggling hard and I can see why she's acting like an ass here. But that still doesnt justify calling someone out for not helping you. People are not obligated to help. So you were right in taking your niece's side here.\n\nHowever, you and your family can chip in some funds to help her get the babysitters that will look after the kids. I get not wanting to babysit those two kids because of the constant fighting, but it really isnt their fault. \n\nKay soooo, its NTA for me, but please try to help your sister she's really in a very rough spot.", "Nta your sister should of tried to get the kids help ages ago and they are not your responsibility it hers.

Yes, at a basic level the kids needs to be taken care of, and they need some serious counseling and communication work done to fix their issues that are not on you either.

The kids need counseling, especially the little girl. What my family had to end up doing was send the one kid who was a danger to the others to his grandma or aunt who doted on him & the other 3 to my mom. It took more planning & driving, but it was the only way it would work. They had to be separated. \n\nEven if your family will just watch your nephew & your BIL's family will just watch your niece, then removing one kid from the situation will make it better. At 8 & 9 years old, they should be able to be alone in the house for short periods, longer if BIL is there but sleeping.\n\nYour sister & BIL are responsible for child care & need to get creative with finding solutions.", "NTA. But can you offer to babysit one of them and another family can watch the other? I'm sure the kids would appreciate it.", "These kids need a proper babysitter. \"Anyone who can spare the time\" is not the right choice - they need someone who can deal with difficult kids.

She needs to get these kids into therapy asap. There is a LOT going on in that household that the kids are absorbing and acting out and she is in denial. It doesn\u2019t sound safe. Have you considered babysitting them separately. One goes to you or grandparents and one goes to your niece? Are they behaved when separated?", "NTA. \n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to split the children up. Maybe let the stepdaughter be babysat by someone in the husband's family. And maybe you can babysit your nephew? That might be easier. Since they don't get along split them up.", "NTA. Hell, I separate my own children when they are fighting, and they actually *do* love each other and *do* play together nicely. Your sister is shooting herself in the foot by trying to force them to be together. It sounds like you all would be willing to take one child each, but she won't allow that option. Beggars can't be choosers. If she won't take the help actually offered, she will have to pay for something else.", "NTA, start guilting her about not getting the kids in therapy. Tell her no one will babysit until the kids get the treatment they need.", "NTA, but would it be possible as a compromise to have the kids watched by separate people?  e.g. (assuming everyone involved was willing) have your niece watch the stepdaughter while you watch your nephew type of thing?  Not sure if that would make the kids any more bearable or not.", "I won't call these bad kids, because it appears they're attempting to deal with a forced relationship and an ailing dad.  Kids could also be lashing out due to fear, since they've both already dealt with family members that have passed away.  However, NTA, that's what happens when you have what's considered bad kids or too many kids. People will not want to deal with them, and they don't have too.", "NTA for saying it, but dear god. If there\u2019s an extended family babysit the kids separately. The immediate problem handled so she can take care of her sick spouse.", "NTA.  This is the consequences of her actions.  Not parenting the kids, or doing anything about it.  Sucks for them, but it is what it is.", "op=NTA\n\nbut you know a solution--if your family are WILLING(under normal circumstances) to babysit is SPLIT the kids between family members.

They should be manageable individually.", "NTA. She should obviously be ashamed.\n\nBut can I make a suggestion?\n\nIf you Do want to help her, and I totally get if you don\u2019t, perhaps the children could go to different people so you only have to deal with one kid?

Also, it really appears that they want to keep the kids together.", "How does the rest of the family suck for not wanting to deal with this shit?", "> *The kids need counseling, especially the little girl*.\n\nSo true.\n\nThe parents of the children need to try very hard to get free counseling through the kids' school.  \n\nIf the school itself doesn't have a counselor on staff, then one should come from another school in the district to see the children.  \n\nThe little girl is already known to be having problems.  In my area a child can be referred to the committee for special ed by a parent, if the school is balky about  getting help for a child.  \n\nSchool budgets are generally insufficient, and this will only start to change if parents lobby for the services their children need.\n\nThere may be free community resources available, too.\n\nNTA", "I don't think they're bad kids at all.

Or provide financial support for grandkids.", "then good luck to them on childcare", "I'm going to guess she also never put her child in therapy after her husband passed away.", "I thought the children were in school? Sounded like they just needed someone to kick the kids up and watch them until Mom comes home?\n\nAnd the parents can want to keep the kids together, but it is clear that the very thing they want is what makes everyone refuse to babysit the kids.\n\nIf anyone wanted to try and help, they could offer to watch one of the kids and see what the reaction was.", "Heaven forbid we teach our kids that we persevere and take care of family, even when it's hard and tough.", "It should be. I agree with you there. But I see no way either of them acknowledges that given they are happy to live in a fantasy land.", "With just one kid it might be doable.", "His family live in another country. Not sure whether they've involved the other sides of the family or not. But I do think they are trying to keep the kids together.", "As far as I am aware, neither child went to therapy after their parent passed away.", "The kids literally make a warzone wherever they go.", "It's even worse to teach children that (metaphorically speaking) they should set themselves on fire to keep disrespectful, awful people like OP's sister warm.", "You have every right to continue to say no and stand up for your niece. If you can, id get all family together on pushing for therapy. So they go from you to the grandparents, to the niece and you all give the same answer: how has therapy been going? Oh, it hasn't yet? Let me know how it goes! \n\nIt sucks so much for the kids. But sometimes you have to go the tough love route and take away all help in order to get people to see the truth.", "If they aren't even willing to help their kids who have had a very hard life, why should you? If the fact that no family member or respected babysitter wants to watch over the children isn't a sign of piss poor parenting, and your sister, along with her husband, failling as parents, then they are delusional. \n\nHave the two kids had any physical confrontations (full-on fights)?", "So walking away from them and giving up is your answer? got it.", "No. Making the mom accountable and do the responsibilities of therapy and figuring it out before burdening everyone else with her lazy parenting.", "NTA obviously but- given the circumstances, is there a possibility of one of the kids staying at a relatives house temporarily, Ie taking care of just one of the kids instead of two? That sounds like a possible way to keep everyone sane until Dad\u2019s feeling better.

Where are the other bioparents?", "NTA - It's inconvenient, but maybe the kids could be split up between different family members? I assume they're better behaved when they are by themselves.", "NTA. \n\nNobody is ever required to babysit someone else\u2019s life choices. In a genuine emergency the morally correct thing would be to sit as a one-off, but this is not that. \n\nI do ask though, if the issue is the relationship between the children, would you and your extended family be willing to babysit them separately (eg stepdaughter stays with your parents, son stays with you, and rotate around the family)? Still no obligation to do so, just wondering if this would work.", "NTA. But if you do want to help - organize for the kids to be babysat separately or Make it clear that you agree with both their stance that they aren\u2019t siblings unless they want to be but misbehaving and cruelty aren\u2019t acceptable when in your care.

Maybe a couple of people could watch them individually, at least in an emergency. One kid goes with Auntie A and the other goes with Cousin B.", "NTA. Yes it would be great to be able to support her, however when they are being unrealistic about the kids, and therefore won't back up any rules a babysitter might want to have, who on earth would do that job without pay.", "If the only hesitance is watching both kids, maybe you could speak among your family members (if you\u2019re willing) about helping out with one child each on the two days the dad has doctor appointments.", "That's so sad.  I was in therapy for close to 2 years after my dad died (I was 11 at the time) and then again when my mom got remarried.  Over 35 years later, I think of my step-dad as a second father, but I still grieve my dad and have a difficult time talking/thinking about him without crying.

Sorry- but yall go on with your sucky parenting but do it alone.", "She shouldn\u2019t have jumped into marriage with that guy, while her kid doesn\u2019t get along with his kid to this extreme extent.", "How would they afford therapy if they can't afford babysitters?", "Counseling is super expensive and if they are struggling financially they might not be able to afford it. When I went for counseling it was $100 per session.", "Yeah I was gonna say, it might seem like they live in a fantasy land but it\u2019s probably a coping mechanism because they can\u2019t afford therapy nor does the sister have the time for it working multiple jobs.\n\nThat said, in the meantime it seems like splitting the kids up might be the best option and OP and other family members have the right to say no regardless. NTA.", "Yeah. Thats why it's important to consider children when making major life choices/changes.", "exactly what I thought, but reading about bother kids having a deceased parent makes me think there is a bit more.\nso I think both sides of the family should watch \"their own kid\"\nthere might be some more hatred to the \"replacement parent\" and that side of the family"]}
