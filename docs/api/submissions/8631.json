Another commenter mentioned what will happen when both babies are born. Which will be your husbands priority. I think that's a legitimate concern and a question you need to discuss with him.\nI understand that your husband is trying to be a good father to his daughter (and that she has noone else to help). I also understand that she call her father for help since she's  a first time mom and probably scared.\nBut you are also a first time mom. Pregnancy is scary and caring for a newborn is too. Doing it while feeling left alone and neglected will not only give you immense stress it will also harm your relationship to your husband.\nI think you need to sit down with him and explain to him how you have been feeling and ask how he sees this in the future. When you have given birth and are taking care of a newborn will he still go to his daughter (then very pregnant) 5 times a week for 3-4 hours?!\nAlso is there anyone else who can help you with your baby? Being a Sahm is going to very stressful when your partner is working full time and spending that much time somewhere else. Completely apart from who is in the right you need to think about how that will work and who can help you.\nI don't know how your relationship to his daughter is but maybe it would also be an idea to spend more time with her especially once the babies are born so you can help each other out and support one another?", "You have a husband problem.  While he is being supportive of his adult pregnant daughter, the time he is spending there seems excessive.  Guessing the father is not in the picture so he is stepping up for her.\n\nThe bigger question is what is he going to do when you have your baby and the daughter then has hers?  Where will his priorities be?", "Info:  How long does he stays at his daughter's house when he visits.  \n\nBecause you can't say he does all the cooking and cleaning and even shaves your legs but then says he's never home. Obviously, he's home plenty to do all those things", "NTA. Not even remotely. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to say that your husband is an AH because he\u2019s doing an amazing job of taking care of someone\u2019s baby\u2019s mama, just unfortunately not his own. \n\nHe\u2019s stuck between a rock and a hard place with having two of his nearest and dearest pregnant at the same time. But this isn\u2019t going to magically get better once the babies arrive. He\u2019s going to have to make a sacrifice. And it shouldn\u2019t be that he chooses to raise his grandchild over his own child. \n\nHe needs to redirect his efforts to helping his daughter build a support system of her own. She\u2019s never going to do that as long as he\u2019s waiting on her hand and foot.", "NTA\n\nAlso your husband needs to realize you are 37 years old aka you are considered a HIGH RISK pregnancy.", "NTA\n\n His daughter is 22. Where's the father of her kid? She should call the baby's daddy, not her daddy. He should be with you , you're the one carrying his kid. You better be careful, his daughter will expect him to raise her kid for her too.", "NTA.\n\nYou are coming to the end of a pregnancy at the age of 37, are carrying large, can't drive, and have to keep off your feet. Your husband should cut back the time he spends with his daughter to be with you! You had a close call, and his response was inadequate.\n\nThe only thing that might help the situation is if you have room in your house for his daughter and soon-to-be LO, which doesn't really sound... ideal.\n\nBest of luck! I had my first at the same age, and my second at 40, so I've been there.", "I'm going to say NAH, especially with your edit (though could her mom come to stay with her for awhile? Soon you'll have a newborn and she'll be in the stage of pregnancy you are now...) \n\nYou need help right now, and you're right that you need him to be responsive if something happens and you need to go to the hospital. If he wasn't answering his phone or waited around, that's absolutely not okay, and in that case I WOULD call him an AH. His wife is 8 months pregnant, he needs his phone on with the ringer up when he's away. She wasn't having an emergency; he should have come home immediately to take you to the ER. If he DID answer promptly and left right away and it just took him a bit to get home...that's more ambiguous--he has to work and someone has to go to the store, etc., and it's not really different than if he'd been doing that and had to drive home to get you.\n\nBut she's his child, and she needs help too, and I can't blame him for helping her when it sounds like she has no one else right now. I'm sure if your baby was in her position in 20 years, you'd want him to do the same. It's a really rough spot and I'm not sure if there is a good answer, except--\n\n1) can her mom come and stay with her and help out? especially since you and Chris will have a newborn just as she's getting to the point where you are now, where it's harder for her to get around and she may need someone to take her to the hospital on short notice. \n\n2) would it be better or worse for you if she were to come and stay with you for awhile? This is ONLY a good option if it would make things less stressful for you, but it seems like if Chris didn't have to go 20 minutes away to help her out, it might actually be better?", "I think you need a backup plan since your husband has made it pretty clear that your pregnancy isn't coming first.\n\nNTA", "You should probably ask your mom or sister to move in immediately, since he refuses to be there for you. You're going to need someone there.", "I have a radical suggestion that you will probably hate. Move his daughter into your house, at least for a while. Then your husband can be there for both of you.", "NTA\n\nI was fully prepared to say you were the AH from the title, but his daughter is a full blown adult making big girl choices. Where is the father of the child? Where is Jenna's mother? Your husband needs to be with you in your time of need, not with his adult daughter.", "NAH. You definitely need him around more by the sound of it. But his daughter is in a similar situation to yourself however she is much younger and appears to have no one else.\n\nChris is in a very, very difficult situation brought on by the two pregnancies being timed only 2 months apart and not enough hours in the day to do everything. \n\nI sure as hell wouldn't want to be in his position, bit I think asking him to limit his visits to his daughter to 3 times per weeks whilst your so heavily pregnant is fair. Just no sure it makes hom an AH for doing otherwise given hoe tough his situation is with the two of you.\n\nWhat's the story with his daughter's mother?", "NTA omg you are about to pop. Will his miss the delivery if Jenna gas another appointment. Your husband is TA for not being by your side these last weeks.", "INFO: why is Jenna\u2019s baby daddy incarcerated?", "It sound's like he's in an impossible situation, torn between being a supportive dad and husband. \n\nStill, he needs to negotiate that in a way that works for you and his daughter. If she's 6 months pregnant and her pregnancy doesn't have any complications than 3 times a week does actually sound reasonable to me.\n\nNTA", "Priorities are essential.  It's great that he's being so helpful,  but he has a wife who is about to burst.  How will he be when is second child comes into the picture.\n\nSingle moms have a hard life,  but she's definitely capable of grocery shopping on her own.  Enabling our kids do them a disservice. \n\nAre you sure he's there and not cheating?", "ESH - there\u2019s a balance here. She\u2019s still his child even though she\u2019s an adult. Going to appointments (as long as they don\u2019t clash with yours), helping with baby\u2019s room are totally normal things to help with.\n\nGoing there five times a week seems excessive though. You guys need to find a compromise that he can support you both. Especially when both babies are here in a few months and everything is going to turn into chaos.", "This was literally posted yesterday.  You were told YTA at that time too.  If I remember correctly the post was removed.", "Except that Jenna is also his child, and she is also much younger and on her own (no mention of Jenna's mum?). Sounds like your husband is doing everything he can to be both a good husband and a good father, give him a break. Limiting contact with his daughter will only put a strain on your relationship. YTA", "I mean, what's your plan if he's not home *or* at Jenna's and you go into labor? Ambulances are expensive, yes, but they exist for a reason...", ">He does always make it up to me. When he is home he cleans, cooks, shaves my legs for me, gives me massages. He\u2019s great but never home\n\nYour second sentence contradicts the first. It sounds like he is home.\n\n>I wanted to go to the hospital but couldn\u2019t go, I was scared I am a first time mom\n\nIf you were that worried, you should have called 911 and if someone does happen, you should call 911.\n\n>It\u2019s not fair, he is my husband and this is our child.\n\nHe's also a father to someone else and was before you came along. He's not going to abandon his other kid for the new one. I think a compromise can be made but it's kind of silly to expect him not to spend time with his and only spend time with you.\n\nMaybe you all need to go to couples counseling to discuss expectations more.", "Would you want him to be this close and helpful with the child you're having with him? It sounds like he's a good dad.\n\nI understand your frustrations, but putting yourself at odds with his daughter will not work out for you in the long run. You can't set boundaries like that unilaterally.", "NTA, but how about a middle ground: suggest that jenna comes stay over for a while so that she doesn't have to deal with it alone and that way your husband can be a dad and a husband properly at the same time. Hell he even sounds like he has a lot on his plate bc he does do it all, as you said, to make it up to you :)\nETA: and this would have his 'workload' reduced :)", "NTA but you need to have a serious talk with your husband. And think about how you consider Jenna. Right now, you are both pregnant and healthy, and both of you seem to rely on the same man. But soon-ish there will be two babies, then two children in the equation. You need to define the roles: either your husband is a father, or a grandfather. But he can't be both.\n\n(note on the age: unless you have other health problems, don't worry too much. My mother was 41 when I was born, and she was the SAHM of my 5 other siblings - with help, yes, but not staying off her feet. Everything went well and the only reason she's now slowing down is because she's 84).", "This situation makes me sad. It\u2019s going to cause major issues one the babies are born. Y\u2019all need to figure out now who is doing what. Your husband sounds like he\u2019s trying to do good by both of you. But he is being stretched too thin. Something has to give. Why can\u2019t her mother come visit for a few months or she go to her mothers for a while to get help. His ultimate priority should be you and the baby you two have made. Not his daughters baby. She is an adult and made choices. He can be there for her, just not to the point of ignoring your needs.", "NTA\n\nI gave birth six weeks ago. It was really close to being a home birth, and would have been if my husband wasn't home. As it was, my husband wasn't able to be in the room with me, and I was too late for an epidural.\n\nYour husband needs to sort out his priorities, ESPECIALLY since she's six months along and you're due any day.", "YTA, you say specifically that he does a great job of helping with the chores and taking care of you. His daughter is only 22 years old, and by your own admission has no one else to support her. As her father and only support system, what other choice does he have?\n\nAs her stepmother, this could be a really great opportunity for you to support her as well. Have you thought of moving her into your home so that you can all be together during this time?\n\nI completely understand your frustration with him being out of the house so frequently, especially with you being high risk, but I think encouraging him to limit the time he spends with his child isn\u2019t a fair solution. You should both be working on a solution to make sure you AND his daughter are properly supported during these pregnancies, not one or the other. \n\nSide note, congratulations, wishing you a happy and healthy delivery!", "YTA. \n\nLook, I'm sure this is tough for you.  But he is also watching his daughter struggle being a single mom.  If you got those Braxton Hicks contractions while he was at work, then what?  Do you just want to demand he not leave the house?\n\nI don't think you are a bad person.  But it sounds like he is essentially trying to be a great dad and husband, and is stretching himself thin to be there for both of the women in his life.  \n\nI feel this is definnitely worth a conversation, but I don't think you should put time limits on how much he can help his daughter.", "he is put in a impossible situations, and making him chose, you know u ll loose right? unfortunately this is the reality, she is his child and will always be even tho she's an adult now... but it's unfortunate for you, your doing it for the first time, and.. you are mostly alone...we dont stop being a parents just because our kids grow up.... when they need us we're gonna show up....\n\ncannot say yta neither nta...", "NTA 3 times a week is reasonable, you are 8 months pregnant with his child and he needs to be there for you at this point. I get he wants to support his daughter and I see she had no other support so it sounds like he is in a tough spot but you are being more than fair. He sounds like a great guy but I guess he sees you an adult who is able to cope and his daughter as a child who can\u2019t. 22 is young but if she is old enough to have a baby and be a single Mum then she needs to accept that she can\u2019t call on Dad 24/7 for the slightest thing when he has a wife who is 8 month\u2019s pregnant!", "NTA- Is he going to miss out on your entire baby's life to help Jenna?", "YTA \n\nsounds like a good dad to me. your step daughter is basically a child herself, her brain hasn\u2019t even fully developed yet. you\u2019re very grown. and you have a support system put in place. she doesn\u2019t. she only has her dad and her dad knows this which is why he\u2019s there for her around the clock.", "YTA. She's his daughter and she's carrying his grandkid. Of course he's going to help her. You said yourself that he takes care of both of you. He also came home when you called him. What else do you want him to do?", "YTA. Sounds like your husband is doing his best to help the two most significant people in his life. Yes, you are his wife, but his daughter is young and on her own, and he's a good and supportive dad (I'm sure you will appreciate that when it comes to your own child) for being there for her. He is also there for you and is being a good and supportive husband:\n\n> *\"He does always make it up to me. When he is home he cleans, cooks, shaves my legs for me, gives me massages.\"*\n\nI mean, he's doing a huge amount of work for both you and his daughter without complaint, and yet you are trying to make him feel guilty, as though he's not doing nearly enough. Putting him in such a difficult position where he has to choose between two people he loves is a total AH move and will only lead to resentment. \n\nChildren are forever, and you don't just ditch out on them when you remarry and start another family.", "This is a tough situation, but YTA. This is not a contest, but you're making this out to be one, and driving a wedge between yourself and Jenna.\n\nMeanwhile, your husband's being a good dad AND husband. \n\nRather than trying to dictate what he should and shouldn't be doing, try to think of a good long-term solution. You're going to be a mom soon. Jenna's going to be a single mom soon.  What can you all do to support each other? Maybe start by being grateful that you have such a good man by your side. Even if he's not with you 24-7, he's there with you, and will be there for you.", "NTA. You come first.", "NAH so far. However, you guys do need to figure out what happens after the babies are born. He cannot reasonably expect to enter into raising two newborns in separate households. The help he's providing her right now is very thoughtful even if it inconveniences you, but he cannot maintain being her substitute partner as well as being your husband and a good father to his own upcoming baby. There needs to be work put in toward connecting his daughter with a decent support network because his availability is going to be limited once he's fathering a newborn again.", "YTA.", "YTA if it weee my daughter single and pregnant, I\u2019d do the same", "Nta, it is commendable that he  wants to be there for his daughter but his number 1 priority should be you and the baby you are carrying. Is he going to run the same visitation when your baby is born? Because that will not work either. It will not be reasonable to be at his daughter 5x a week for a minimum of 4 hours each time when he has a baby at home and a postpartum artum wife.", "NTA. You need your husband with you right now. He shouldn\u2019t be leaving you for so long because his grown daughter has made some really shitty choices. You need to have a come to Jesus talk with him before he starts leaving you with a little baby because his daughter is going to want his help as well.", "NTA - he has already chosen which child he will be there for.  It\u2019s not yours but his daughters.\n\nHave a serious discussion with him or plan on being a single parent, in actuality or just in the fact that he will not be there for you or your child.", "NTA. I got a feeling this situation will continue to get worse as the months go by. I get he is trying to be helpful but I think you and him need to sit down to discuss boundaries and expectations.", "NAH- very difficult situation and sounds like Chris is trying to juggle it all which of courses means no one feels he\u2019s doing enough. \n\nIs there any extended family that can help Chris with supporting Jenna as her need is real too. Is moving in with her Mom an option given baby\u2019s father is not around.", "YTA.  You are clearly overly emotional and jealous.  If it were a sibling of his or something I might agree.  However it's his kid he's known wayyy longer than you so you should have already expected it lol", "NAH. You're in a tough situation but he's still a dad and Jenna is still very young. You need to be an adult here because your husband is doing the best he can for both of you and Jenna has no one but her dad. Why not try talking to both of them about the situation, together? Especially before you two give birth because the jealousy issues will only worsen once the babies are born.", "NTA - Is it possible for Jenna to live in with you temporarily?", "NAH.  \nYeah. You're a first time high risk pregnancy, and that sucks that you're nervous and being left alone. \nYour husband is also a father, and he's being a great dad to his kid.

No one involved is. My goal would be to strengthen my marriage, face the challenge together. Right now I doubt Chris would tell you if he\u2019s burnt out, or confide in you if he\u2019s getting concerned that Jenna is relying too heavily on him. Not if he feels that you\u2019re against her.

It\u2019s better that you guys figure out a solution now than when you\u2019re recovering and sleep deprived after the birth. Sit down and figure out a fair division of his time and responsibilities. Pull in other people to help. Family, friends, neighbors. A meal train for you and for his daughter when the time comes. Perhaps a postpartum doula or housekeeper if you can afford it.

Where are her baby daddy's parents? Where are her friends? Does she have Aunts/Uncles/Cousins who can help? Can she join a support group for single mothers, or partners of incarcerated individuals? \n\nHer father should be helping her begin to reach out to these other supports, instead of trying to do it all on his own.

Can she afford unpaid leave?\n\nIf it was my child who was going to have a newborn alone I'd want to help, and if they were going to end up homeless/unable to support themselves I'd want to do something about that too. I think OP needs to have a serious conversation with husband about step-daughter's finaical situation and what's going to happen. If they do need to help support her, the cheapest way (not sure if that's a concern for them) is to live together. What OP does need to make clear is that she is not going to watch both babies all day while step-daughter is at work if she's staying home. If they don't want her to move in, how much help is she going to need? Finical and otherwise? Can they make that work? Afford it? Time? \n\nLess dramatic then moving in one solution to OP being lonely if they all get along is having Step-daughter visit them instead of the other way around. Can she come visit? Her and dad could cook for OP together etc. When the babies are born, can she visit? Or husband could visit her with the baby? Basically, have double baby time or babysit at the grandparents house so OP isn't left alone with baby while he helps his daughter. Once baby is born, he could also take baby on short visits to daughter's.", "I know a lot of people think it\u2019s a horrible idea, but depending on personalities, this might not be the worst plan. \n\nThe daughter is going to need a lot of support when she gives birth and with a newborn. And so is wife and their baby. If they can stand to be in close quarters, it firstly reduces to amount of time the husband has to choose to be with one of the other, removes commute time in an emergency, could mean the new moms have each other for support and \u201ccan you watch the baby while I pee/shower/eat\u201d type of help. \n\nObviously if she\u2019ll never leave or just expect OP to care for both babies while she lives her best young and unencumbered life, it\u2019s a terrible idea, but if the daughter genuinely wants to make the best life she can for her kid and they aren\u2019t high conflict\u2026 it could be a good thing. \n\nPlus if OP suggests it, she can suggest it\u2019s set up in a way that doesn\u2019t make her tear her hair out. Whereas if the daughter needs so much help from her father at her current stage of pregnancy, by the time the baby arrives, any combination of colicky baby/not being ready to go back to work and running out of money/childcare expense issues/ppd/just not coping could mean she arrives home one day to find the daughter moved in and she gets 0 say. \n\nI\u2019m not blaming anyone here, both OP and daughter need support and logically the husband is the closest person to both to provide it, as the daughters babies father is in prison. OPs husband clearly acknowledges that you\u2019re not just automatically done being a parent when your kid turns 18 and seems to be doing his best even if he\u2019s not balancing things especially well right now.

Prenatal yoga, etc is great.", "That\u2019s why I asked if you read the post! In more than half of the paragraphs OP states that she knows he\u2019s at Jenna\u2019s, so I would say it was a terrible question in this case. Also him never being home is an issue but, OP states he either working or at Jenna\u2019s (which OP states he does tell her, so she knows where he is and what he doing when he\u2019s over: helping with the baby room, buying groceries, etc.). Also I can understand being defensive when your first daughter is also pregnant and expecting and you\u2019re trying to run around and help both your wife and daughter. Plus where in the post did it say that he was hard to get ahold of? During the part where she was experiencing pain she said she called him and even though he got their later than she wanted, she was fully able to get ahold of him", "My first one was alright, second one was way worse, I had multiple popped stitches, an infection and ended up on 3 weeks bedrest AFTER baby was born because the infection was so bad. I had tried doing way too much the second time and paid for it dearly. Everyone\u2019s recovery is different but definitely not an easy thing to go through at all. And the document they read you before you go in? Oh my god the way they list every single way you could die on the table or become paralyzed, it\u2019s terrifying\n\nAnd moving can be smart during pregnancy for sure. But some women are put on bed rest for a reason. Ignoring doctors orders isn\u2019t a good idea."]}
