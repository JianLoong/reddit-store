He thinks I'm selfish for considering this. I don't think I am. He suggested I post here to see what you all say.\n\nWe have been together 12 years.\n\nMy partner has two responsibilities in terms of the house. He walks the dogs in the morning and he goes to work full time (8-6). More often than not, he falls asleep at 8pm. He works in IT.\n\nWe have three children (7, 4, 2) and I am fully responsible for their care, as well as every household duty, laundry, cooking, cleaning. I am a SAHM, but I am also self employed, so after I look after the children all day, I then work for a couple of hours on my laptop. \n\nMy birthday is coming up.\nI asked my partner what he would think if I booked myself a vacation, for a week, on my birthday and went on my own. If he could use his PTO to take time off to look after and spend the week with our three children - taking them to school and taking care of the house.\n\nHe told me I was selfish.\n\"It's selfish to want to go on holiday for a week for my birthday?\"\nHe said yes.\n\nMy partner hasn't done a load of laundry in the ten years. He cooks dinner 'occasionally' (2 x a month). He doesn't hoover, mop, or mow lawns. I get it, he's tired and he works full time, but I work too, and I don't feel appreciated. I just want a week where I don't have to placate a crying child, or stop the toddler from running into traffic, or worry about everyone else's good time while sacrificing my own. \n\nThe last time I spent time away from the children/house was when we went out for dinner for his birthday in March (After they were asleep. I organised the babysitter). Oh, and my pap smear, which he tried to make me take the children too even though he was home.\n\nThe holiday would be paid for entirely by me.\n\nHe gets 28 days of PTO, not including bank holidays.

This sounds like a hugely unfair set up and no wonder you are feeling so burned out. He's not pulling his weight at all here - sounds completely draining to be married to a partner who does so little and apparently is willing to do so little more (take your kids to an invasive medical test?! No thanks). I think you need to address that underlying issue. \n\nYou're NTA for wanting the holiday but it's a symptom of a much bigger problem.", "You\u2019re not a SAHM. You have a part time job. Your division of home labor is insanely unbalanced, and all of it falls to you. \n\nOf course your husband refuses to let you take a holiday, he\u2019d have to actually lift a finger to parent his own children if you did. \n\nPlease for your own sake book that holiday and inform him you will be going. Perhaps if he had to do a fraction of everything you\u2019d done for years he\u2019d finally see how unfair he\u2019s been to you.", "NTA\n\nI think it's entirely reasonable to want some time alone and where you can do whatever you want. \n\nI do believe there might be an underlying issue, since the way you talk about him not helping sound like it bothers you more, than you might let on. \n\nMaybe it's time to have a good long talk about how you guys manage your household and make some changes.", "NTA.  Just the childcare you're doing is a full-time job with children those ages.  Added to that you're doing all the housework, all of the cooking (two times a month is not frequent), AND 2+ hours of self-employment working from home.  It sounds like you have multiple full-time jobs, while he has one.  Consider pricing out what it would cost to have someone do your work full-time as an experiment.  How much would it cost to hire a nanny for three children of those ages full-time?  How much would it cost to hire a maid to complete the house chores you do?  How much would hiring a lawn service cost?  How much would having a home cook, or having meals delivered every day cost?  Do you walk the dogs outside of the time he does in the morning?  If so, add it to the list.  \n\n\nThose are the costs of your labor.  That's what the two of you save by you doing that work.  There's a decent possibility those labor costs would cost more money than he makes, and the hours those people would need to work to complete the work you are doing easily total more than the hours he's putting in at the office and walking the dogs in the morning.  This doesn't even include whatever you make at the work from home job you do after dinner.  \n\n\nA reasonable split would be that you do the same eight hours of work he does (be it caring for the kids, cooking, cleaning, etc.) and then the two of you split the remaining duties relatively evenly.  When he comes home from work, he thinks of it as him clocking out of work- but when do you get to clock out?  Because it's not after just eight hours of work.  \n\n\nHe's not pulling his weight here, and it seems like he's not even appreciating the fact that you're doing the vast majority of the work in this situation.    \n\n\nI know this hurts to hear, but I'd recommend you seek out counseling on your own to decide whether this is a healthy relationship for you to stay in and whether he's capable of making the changes needed to make your marriage into a partnership instead of you doing all the child-rearing and house labor while he is free to work without even doing the basic amount of housework he'd do if he were a single man with no kids.", "NTA. But you\u2019re TA to yourself for letting him be a bum the last 10 years. Asleep by 8pm?  WTF? Wake his ass up and help with the 3 kids.", "NTA. You deserve a break from the kids. You are not just a SAHM, but also work and take care of the household. It's not unreasonable to want a break.", "Oh book that trip and go those are his children and he needs to start stepping up to the plate. His I work attitude and dumping everything on you is BS you work full-time taking care of home and children and then continue into the evening working another job. So you are putting in what like 90 to 100 hours a week working to his what 40 with lunches and breaks you don't even dream about. Put it into monetary perspective if you had to hire a cook, housecleaner, laundry service, gardener, childcare just how much would that cost? Estimated without the garden is over 112K us dollars. Enjoy your trip and NTA", "NTA. You need a break. You are trying to tell your partner this and he is not being supportive. He could at least offer to let you have a few days to yourself even if you're still staying home.", "No you aren't and after your post I can see why you need it.\nYour husband needs his eyes opened and quickly.\nI highly recommend couples counseling.. while he still has a functioning wife.... After your vacation!!!!", "NTA. My life was the same before my ex and I split. I miss my kids when they're with their dad (I work) but I actually have time to myself now. You totally deserve this trip. But your husband will sabatoge it some how if you do.", "NTA. But you do realise you have 4 kids living with you, not 3? He might be the size of an adult, but he sure is acting like your child, not your partner.", "NTA There is nothing wrong about wanting time alone and being responsible for only yourself. In fact, it could be beneficial for everyone. When people burn out, it affects everyone around them. If your partner is adamant about a whole week, perhaps they'll be amenable to a three day weekend. I hope you get a much needed break.", "NTA\n\nA week is a long time to leave a two year old, especially with someone who has never cared for them before so for their sake maybe go for a weekend. \n\nI do think you need to address the issue with a more long term solution, you can\u2019t keep going like this, your husband has to help. You work 24/7 with the children and house AND you do a part time job from home. He works 8-6 and goes to sleep at 8, your husband needs to step up and be a real partner and dad.", "ESH - not for wanting time off, I have 3 children too and I work full time, my husband works abroad/offshore so I get where you\u2019re coming from, however for all his faults my husband is amazing when he is home. I could leave for a week and everything would be fine. \n\nHowever you have allowed this imbalance to arise, you\u2019ve had 3 children and never redressed the workload. If you went away for a week it would be a nightmare for your children, your partner will not be able to cope and your children won\u2019t cope without you there and a stressed father. \n\nWhen I first moved in with my husband, he used to finish work before me and I would walk in and he would ask me what was for dinner when he had been home for 2 hours. We had the talk then and I made it clear that I wasn\u2019t his mother.\n\nYou need to build up to it, he needs to start doing more around the house. Although as a starter for 10 I\u2019d book myself a spa day and leave him with the kids for a day but you\u2019ll have to prep everything and give him a list of instructions.\n\nFrankly at this point apart from money I don\u2019t really see what your partner is contributing to the relationship.", "Girl, YWBTA to yourself if you don't go.  This man needs to experience what is like to have to manage the house and kids without you.  I try to take a girls' trip every other year. It rejuvenates me and reminds him how much I actually do around here.", "NTA You've got a roommate, not a partner", "NTA. I would be looking at a divorce while you\u2019re there tbh. One less person to run around after. If you do go though expect to have a weeks worth of housework waiting for you when you get back because he won\u2019t magically start not being completely selfish. And will blame your \u2018high standards\u2019 for doing fuck all.", "NTA, but the real issue is an inappropriate division of labor in your relationship. Your partner needs to pitch in more, or, he needs to be more willing to give you what you want in matters like this in exchange for the inequitable distribution of labor.\n\nNo relationship is 100% fifty-fifty all the time, but this is way out of whack. It sounds like work is your partner's life, and he's OK with this, but that doesn't mean you have to be. And honestly, from someone whose parents had quite a similar arrangement: your partner should consider what this may be doing to his relationship with his kids. I wish like crazy that my dad had been around more during my childhood.\n\nA week of stay-at-home dadding would do him, them, and you all some good. He should embrace it as the least he can do.", "NTA. \n\nBook the vacation, call each night only to say goodnight to the kids, and do whatever the heck you want. You\u2019re not an indentured servant. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t realize how much you do by the time you get back or blames you for anything going wrong, go to marriage counseling. \n\nWhat an absolute child, and you\u2019ve been taking care of not 3 but 4 children for a decade and don\u2019t deserve a break? WOW", "PUT HIM IN THE BIN\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou also have 4 children, not 3\n\nI can also guarantee, if you do go away, he will call you 24/7 to try and guilt and manipulate you into coming back home with the hopes youll never do it again because of how awful he made it last time", "My husband does the lions share of paid work, me the kids/house. \nI gave him the heads up that I was off to visit my friend interstate for a bit over a week during his leave and he decided to sit down and write the list of all the crap I do, appointments to keep, school activities etc. \nit took us over an hour. \nHe dropped me at the airport, got both our mums to help for the days he had plans (the stuff he booked his actual leave for) and just\u2026 got on with it. \n\nWhen he picked me up he paused and said \u201cI really appreciate all the stuff you do behind the scenes, it\u2019s a lot\u201d I got to say \u201c I really appreciate that you work your ass of so I can\u201d \n\nAnd that\u2019s how normal, healthy relationships can work. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. I let my ex wife go on a week long trip alone a year and a half in. No reason you can't have a break. Although my ex cheated on me on her trip, I would advise you against that part", "Yr NTA , having said that does having to take a week off on short notice have an impact on your husband's job . In that case you might want to move the dates ahead .\n\nSecond , is there a financial element to this situation.  Do you want from your 2 hours a day self employment. How much is the vacation cost and how does that impact your budget. Is this a consideration in your husband reaction?\n\nFinally the issue is more than the vacation. You are burning out due to workload and your grievance is that your husband does not pull his weight . Vacation or not , you should have an honest discussion on this with your husband", "Probably not going to be popular but for me, ESH.\n\nThis has nothing to do with you taking a week off and going on a vacation. You don't sound very happy in this marriage and clearly, your husband should be more involved in taking care of the kids and household chores.\n\nAlso, you don't talk about how you two split the house bills and expenses linked to the kids. If you can afford this trip because your husband is the only contributing to the bills, that changes a lot of things about the perspective you're giving us about your husband working so much.\n\nAlso, I know he's the kids's father, but why would you leave them alone with him for a week when he doesn't seem to anything about them or want to spend time with them ?", "It seems pretty odd that you wouldn't want to find child care and have your husband with you. \n\nI have let my wife go on 'girls vacations' with sister in laws and stuff like that but, if she asked me to just vacation alone without me, I'd likely find it off putting as well.\n\nwithout a crapload more context I would say NAH, since clearly this vacation idea is not much more than a bandaid idea for your other issues that you have, and since clearly it feels pretty weird for a significant other to basically be like \"I want vacation away from you\"\n\nmost people are going to say not TA here, I would suggest taking it with a grain of salt,  on such small context, because \"you can do what you want\" but... the reality in my opinion is a bit more contextual about how relationships and feelings *actually* work.  \n\nSometimes just because we all have the ability to 'do what we want' doesn't mean it's actually the best idea for a relationship.  Especially one that you didn't say a single good thing about this guy.", "NTA. Book the vacation it's not selfish to want a break. Your on-SAHM duty 24/7 while he is neglecting his share of childcare and household chores. He needs to contribute to the household and childcare more. Take the vacation and give him a taste of what being full time SAHM is like.", "I dunno. I struggle with the whole wanting a break from your kids. You chose this, they didn't. \n\nI definitely think your husband should pitch in more.", "NTA\n\nCan you counter it with, if I can do this, you can go on a boys trip for a week without me and the kids? Would he even consider that?", "I don\u2019t think taking care of your children should count as a job. You chose to have them so it\u2019s at least the bare minimum you should do is look after the kids you chose to bring into this world. That\u2019s what you signed up for. Now your husband needs to pitch in more. If he\u2019s tired after work, so what? When you decide to have children, looking after them doesn\u2019t have a start or finish time. He needs to realize that he had a part to play in having kids and being tired isn\u2019t an excuse to dump the work load on you. More than a vacation, you need couples therapy. I understand you are burned out but let\u2019s say you do go on vacation and nothing changes, you\u2019ll just end up counting the days until the next vacation. I feel getting him to pitch in more and help more when it comes to dealing with the kids. I feel if he chips in more, you can get your rest here and there while he takes over. Cause when things are as one sided as they are, I could see it not only burning you out, but I could see some type of resentment brewing against your family cause although he\u2019s there, it seems (from this post) you doing most of the heavy lifting alone.", "You sound as though what you really want is to show your husband how difficult it is to do everything that you do, which is understandable, but your children are very young.  If you're not 100% certain that your husband is practicing weaponized incompetence, then you are jeopardizing the children's well-being and potentially traumatizing them, for an entire week.  \n\nYeesh, I'm going with ESH, adults only, of course.", "INFO how much money do each of you make?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How about the damn men pull their heads out of their arses and become fully grown adults who don\u2019t NEED TO BE TOLD what to do?\n\nI really don\u2019t agree with your judgment, as if it\u2018s OP\u2018s fault that our society has done it this way for soooo many years and of course it\u2019s part of the woman\u2018s load again to change that, as if women don\u2019t have it hard enough already you pile onto her by telling her she sucks because she should have **parented her husband** at the beginning of the relationship?", "I agree. I work full time and so does my partner. We each live in the UK, like OP and I know how much leave we get here is massively in excess of what Americans normally get. This means that this imbalance can\u2019t just be flipped overnight if it doesn\u2019t have to be, as OP has allowed this to happen over many years. OP\u2019s husband would be overwhelmed with stuff he\u2019s never done, nor had to do and the kids would not know what was happening, especially the younger one. She absolutely needs to redress the balance but taking a week isn\u2019t the way to go at first. A couple of weekends away to start with and also let\u2019s be honest, he\u2019ll need training. If he\u2019s not willing to do this then sorry OP, you need to get out of this. It isn\u2019t fair and you\u2019re basically a single parent now anyway.", "He puts them to bed most evenings (the older two), but doesn't do the bath or story part, it's mostly just tucking them in and sitting with 4M until he falls asleep. (Then he often falls asleep, that's why he's asleep by 8pm)\n\nIf he doesn't feel like putting them to bed, I find out when I'm working and all of a sudden I hear children running riot upstairs while he's on his phone.", "She pays half the household expenses. But this is also totally irrelevant to the fact that he\u2019s not pulling his weight.", "He\u2019d never take the kids 50% of the time. He\u2019d take maybe a few days a month. But her workload would still go down", "OP's husband is regretting his suggestion to post here. How sure was he of himself that the thought even occurred to him only to be bashed here.\n\nOP, you should not only go to your vacation, but also seriously rethink your relationship when you are on vacation.\n\nNTA.", "I (40s M) hate that attitude so much. I did the families laundry for a bunch of years growing up when my mom had a cancer scare. One less thing for her to deal with. I would have been in my preteens when I choose to take that on.\n\nWhen I got married I just started doing the laundry. My wife has no issues with doing the laundry and does it occasionally but most often I do it. Her jobs have always been more stressful and longer hours so it really just makes sense.\n\nI think the big thing that helpws form my attitude is my folks modeled that house work is house work and everyone contributes. No task is just moms or dads. Everybody eats, poops, wears cloths etc. So why wouldn't they contribute to cooking, cleaning and laundry?", "She says in the comments that she makes less than he does, but still pays half the household expenses, so he has more \u201cfun money\u201d than she does.", "You don't need to ask permission, he's not your goddamn boss. Tell him you're going on holiday.", "But it\u2019s fair to him that his dad is never around and never takes care of him? His dad needs to step up and build a relationship with him, and that\u2019s never going to happen as long as his dad can fob him off on you all the time.", "If he\u2019s not willing to compromise to something like this you really need to address it.", "NO! You've sacrificed enough!", "You should be looking to \"compromise\" on him doing half of the chores all the time, not that your first vacation in many years is shorter.", "So you're essentially a single parent with a deadbeat husband? He doesn't help with the kids at all? Honey, you need that week of vacation. Your husband HAS to do his share of parenting too. It's not fair for you to do everything, all the time, plus work. You should be demanding couples therapy too. Cause honestly, why have just a body there that does nothing but add more to your already full plate? Why have kids if you won't lift a finger to help your spouse with them? I don't understand parents that do that, and I don't understand the parents that stay with the ones who do. You need rest too, you deserve to rest. NTA OP, but you and the kids deserve a more present and involved husband/father.", "Why did you carry on having children with this man? He is letting his children down as well as you. What exactly is he bringing to the table?", "NTA\n\nYou obviously have more issues to ultimately deal with than taking a vacation. Why does your partner avoid (at all costs) spending time with his family?\n\nAs to the issue at hand, take your vacation. A long weekend (Friday-Monday) is probably a good compromise, and you have a right to have some alone time (pap smear doesn\u2019t count). \n\nBTW, you commented that the house is in his name only. Is that correct? Are you legally married? What are the laws in your area regarding what you\u2019d be entitled to if the relationship ended? Would you have rights to 12 years of equity in the house? \n\nYou\u2019re a SAHM with a WFH part time job, yet you\u2019re equally splitting the bills and doing all of the work around the home. This isn\u2019t fair at all, and you need to protect yourself.", "He\u2019ll probably call his mommy and ask her to take the week off work to babysit his kids for him. So I\u2019m betting the kids will be fine, but hopefully it will be a wake up call for OP that big things need to change in her marriage if it\u2019s going to survive.", "I did not see that comment. Wow. He sounds like a stand up guy /s", "OP is not responsible for society, no. She is responsible for her choice to have three children with a complete bum. He has been like this for longer than their oldest has been alive, so it's not like she had no idea.\n\nI feel sorry for OP, I do, but this is a disaster of her own making", "I\u2019m sorry i just realised your working outside of the home too. Your human too and deserve a break. A Partnership is meant to be 50/50.  Maybe a conversation between you two, with you calmly but firmly stating what changes you need. \n\nHe\u2019s probably nervous about looking after the kids on his own while your away because he doesn\u2019t help out on a regular. If he stepped up on the kids day to day routine, you taking a week away wouldn\u2019t be so daunting for him.", "You\u2019re putting in the same amount of money to the household but he is getting an investment (the house) and you get nothing? If you divorce he will own the house, you won\u2019t have anything. Have you considered this?", "Why are you paying equal amounts when you don\u2019t work (and probably don\u2019t get paid) equal amounts. This marriage seems to work in his favour. What do you get out of it?", "That\u2019s not right, it doesn\u2019t take any account of your labour looking after the kids and house. Labour that does have a cost - that some people are paid to do, that he\u2019d have to pay people to do if he was a single father, and therefore a financial contribution to the household that you make. \nHe also able to make those payments to his mortgage and have money left over because of you. Does he even have enough for other costs left over from his repayments?", "2 things:\n\n1) What does he do with this 'fun' money? Date nights? Gifts for you? Anything to do with the kids?\n\n2) he earns that money because you're a (sort of, you *also* work) SAHM. That isn't *his* money, it belongs to both of you - isn't that the contract of being a SAHM? You take care of the kids so he can work and earn more? Why does he get all the free time, money and fun?", "NTA- Honey, when you are a SAHM with a part time job, he should be paying you. He is abusing you. You would be better if you divorced him, you would have more money and one less child to take care of.\n\nLook up the song Labour- by Paris Poloma. If I were you I would play it on  repeat until my kids new the words by heart and sing it to him everyday.\n\nYou deserve better.", "Why are your finances so separated? This is so unhealthy. Me and my husband and I have separate bank accounts, however our money is our money. He works full time, so he pays the majority of the bills, groceries, etc. If we book a holiday, we both contribute. However, if one person has more money than the other, then they would pay for the big stuff. Household stuff is shared. Childcare is shared. \n\nYou need couples therapy more than a holiday. Your marriage is very uneven, and you don't have things worked out correctly. You have a big husband problem.", "Holiday aside, what would happen in an emergency? My sister was in a car accident that required a few days in hospital - her ex husband didn\u2019t wash school uniforms, know which day was swimming or judo (all written on the calendar) was so he didn\u2019t take them, didn\u2019t bath them or make them brush their teeth. They hadn\u2019t been given meals just lots of snacks because \u2018he can\u2019t cook\u2019. The house was a tip and she was expected to sort it all out when she got home with a broken leg. He hadn\u2019t even picked up toys/clothes on the floor that she could trip over on crutches. That\u2019s when she finally divorced him. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you have somebody you can rely on. Three kids is a lot of work and if he\u2019s going to bed at 8pm then he can\u2019t even be helping with bedtime. Your kids are learning that this is all women\u2019s work. You don\u2019t need to live like this - you and your children deserve way better.", "Why are you with this guy? What is he bringing to the table? I\u2019m really not seeing anything. He does no house work and you split expenses 50/50. That is not equitable. It really doesnt seem like you get any positives out of this relationship \n\nThings might actually get easier for you if you leave him.", "He is out of line here . As I have said before , there needs to broader discussion on split of tasks as he is not contributing enough and that leads to your burn out .", "Weird, as usual communication is the real issue though, you cant just stew until you are boiling over. She should've tried talking and divvying up responsibility way sooner. Just saying i want a week away out the blue is also bad communication especially since he never shouldered any responsibility, honestly if thats the case i dont know how she will trust him with the house and kids for a week. Hes never done it before apparently.\n\nShe needs to talk about him stepping up, and there being a communal fund based on income with the both of them.\n\nThen there needs to be some teaching and observation before she leaves him with the kids, bonus brownie points to him if he ends up paying for her week away afterwards.", "NTA to OP\n\nAnd screw the compromise, as u/bobobono7 said.\n\nYou need a break, and during the break you need to plan for the future. This isn\u2019t right.", "Cats in the cradle and a silver spoon, little boy blue and the man in the moon. When you comin' home dad, I don't know when, but we'll have a good time then, son. You know we'll have a good time then", "OP is essentially a single mom. OP, you seem like such a dear and I mean this as gently as possible but I think your husband is taking complete advantage of you. I know it's much easier said than done but if you have the ability to support you and your little ones on your salary alone (apologies if I misunderstood what you were saying about financials in your other reply) it is this online stranger's unsolicited opinion that you consider separating or serious couple's therapy. Truly, what is your partner adding, if not subtracting, from your life? \n\nI'm very sorry you've not had the partnership you deserve \ud83d\ude1e", "He\u2019s a grown ass adult.

If he loves his children and is not a total moron, he\u2019ll figure it out. I don\u2019t have kids, but when my sibling needed emergency childcare for two kids, ages 5 and 1, for a long weekend, I stepped up and figured it out. If I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, I asked the older one what mommy and daddy usually do, or I googled it, or I just used my best judgment. The kids and I went to the park, and a very nice mom helped me when I couldn\u2019t figure out how to fold the double stroller. They ate regular nutritious meals and went to bed at a reasonable hour and wore clean, weather appropriate clothing, and I changed dozens of diapers. I did dishes and laundry and picked up their toys and figured out which closet the vacuum was in so I could clean. Was it perfect? Nope. But it was fine. Everyone survived, and the kids had fun, and the parents got to tend to the emergency that necessitated the childcare. Because I love the kids and I\u2019m not a total moron, so I managed to keep them alive and the house from falling apart for multiple days in a row. If I can do it, so can the kids\u2019 dad who lives with them and **is their dad**.", "How dare i insinuate that adults need o communicate and work together to raise their kids, and treating the other parent like a child is also damaging and leads to a partner not knowing how to look after their kids properly.\n\nAlso how dare i ask that someone take time to improve communication and teach the other how to do said responsibility. Lol. You guys are hilarious.", "Honestly you\u2019re the hilarious one here. This is a grown ass man. This woman has four children to raise along with doing all of the chores and working a part time job. With what time is she supposed to communicate with him?! With what time is she supposed to teach this grown ass man how to care for his own children and how to boil pasta and open a jar. Do you think women come with all the knowledge on how to clean, cook, and care for children in our heads?! Fuck no but we figure it out. He can watch a damn YouTube video or idk throw some frozen chicken nuggets in the oven. I\u2019m so sick of people insinuating that women are just failing to communicate when the bar for men is in fucking hell.", "But you didn\u2019t say \u201cadults need to communicate.\u201d You said it is OP\u2019s responsibility to teach her husband to care for his own children.", "It's the husband, I'm sure, regretting her posting here. Lol.\n\nHis arguments make no sense, that's how you know.", "Yeah its called a partnership if you have been treating the other partner a certain way the whole time and you want it to change, you dont just demand change you help them and show them what you want. You dont just demand a weeklong vacation and think everyone is going to be ok when you have done everything.\n\nYes he is taking no responsibility, yes he should do more. And its shitty that he can't even think about a week alone with the kids without her. But she has also enabled this behavior, she should have communicated better and insisted on a better split of income and responsibilities.\n\nYou work together in a relationship, you help each other to be better. Thinking she holds no responsibility or accountability is nonsense."]}
