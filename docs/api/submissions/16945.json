He thinks I'm selfish for considering this. I don't think I am. He suggested I post here to see what you all say.\n\nWe have been together 12 years.\n\nMy partner has two responsibilities in terms of the house. He walks the dogs in the morning and he goes to work full time (8-6). More often than not, he falls asleep at 8pm. He works in IT.\n\nWe have three children (7, 4, 2) and I am fully responsible for their care, as well as every household duty, laundry, cooking, cleaning. I am a SAHM, but I am also self employed, so after I look after the children all day, I then work for a couple of hours on my laptop. \n\nMy birthday is coming up.\nI asked my partner what he would think if I booked myself a vacation, for a week, on my birthday and went on my own. If he could use his PTO to take time off to look after and spend the week with our three children - taking them to school and taking care of the house.\n\nHe told me I was selfish.\n\"It's selfish to want to go on holiday for a week for my birthday?\"\nHe said yes.\n\nMy partner hasn't done a load of laundry in the ten years. He cooks dinner 'occasionally' (2 x a month). He doesn't hoover, mop, or mow lawns. I get it, he's tired and he works full time, but I work too, and I don't feel appreciated. I just want a week where I don't have to placate a crying child, or stop the toddler from running into traffic, or worry about everyone else's good time while sacrificing my own. \n\nThe last time I spent time away from the children/house was when we went out for dinner for his birthday in March (After they were asleep. I organised the babysitter). Oh, and my pap smear, which he tried to make me take the children too even though he was home.\n\nThe holiday would be paid for entirely by me.\n\nHe gets 28 days of PTO, not including bank holidays.

This sounds like a hugely unfair set up and no wonder you are feeling so burned out. He's not pulling his weight at all here - sounds completely draining to be married to a partner who does so little and apparently is willing to do so little more (take your kids to an invasive medical test?! No thanks). I think you need to address that underlying issue. \n\nYou're NTA for wanting the holiday but it's a symptom of a much bigger problem.", "You\u2019re not a SAHM. You have a part time job. Your division of home labor is insanely unbalanced, and all of it falls to you. \n\nOf course your husband refuses to let you take a holiday, he\u2019d have to actually lift a finger to parent his own children if you did. \n\nPlease for your own sake book that holiday and inform him you will be going. Perhaps if he had to do a fraction of everything you\u2019d done for years he\u2019d finally see how unfair he\u2019s been to you.", "NTA\n\nI think it's entirely reasonable to want some time alone and where you can do whatever you want. \n\nI do believe there might be an underlying issue, since the way you talk about him not helping sound like it bothers you more, than you might let on. \n\nMaybe it's time to have a good long talk about how you guys manage your household and make some changes.", "NTA.  Just the childcare you're doing is a full-time job with children those ages.  Added to that you're doing all the housework, all of the cooking (two times a month is not frequent), AND 2+ hours of self-employment working from home.  It sounds like you have multiple full-time jobs, while he has one.  Consider pricing out what it would cost to have someone do your work full-time as an experiment.  How much would it cost to hire a nanny for three children of those ages full-time?  How much would it cost to hire a maid to complete the house chores you do?  How much would hiring a lawn service cost?  How much would having a home cook, or having meals delivered every day cost?  Do you walk the dogs outside of the time he does in the morning?  If so, add it to the list.  \n\n\nThose are the costs of your labor.  That's what the two of you save by you doing that work.  There's a decent possibility those labor costs would cost more money than he makes, and the hours those people would need to work to complete the work you are doing easily total more than the hours he's putting in at the office and walking the dogs in the morning.  This doesn't even include whatever you make at the work from home job you do after dinner.  \n\n\nA reasonable split would be that you do the same eight hours of work he does (be it caring for the kids, cooking, cleaning, etc.) and then the two of you split the remaining duties relatively evenly.  When he comes home from work, he thinks of it as him clocking out of work- but when do you get to clock out?  Because it's not after just eight hours of work.  \n\n\nHe's not pulling his weight here, and it seems like he's not even appreciating the fact that you're doing the vast majority of the work in this situation.    \n\n\nI know this hurts to hear, but I'd recommend you seek out counseling on your own to decide whether this is a healthy relationship for you to stay in and whether he's capable of making the changes needed to make your marriage into a partnership instead of you doing all the child-rearing and house labor while he is free to work without even doing the basic amount of housework he'd do if he were a single man with no kids.", "NTA. But you\u2019re TA to yourself for letting him be a bum the last 10 years. Asleep by 8pm?  WTF? Wake his ass up and help with the 3 kids.", "NTA. You deserve a break from the kids. You are not just a SAHM, but also work and take care of the household. It's not unreasonable to want a break.", "Oh book that trip and go those are his children and he needs to start stepping up to the plate. His I work attitude and dumping everything on you is BS you work full-time taking care of home and children and then continue into the evening working another job. So you are putting in what like 90 to 100 hours a week working to his what 40 with lunches and breaks you don't even dream about. Put it into monetary perspective if you had to hire a cook, housecleaner, laundry service, gardener, childcare just how much would that cost? Estimated without the garden is over 112K us dollars. Enjoy your trip and NTA", "NTA. You need a break. You are trying to tell your partner this and he is not being supportive. He could at least offer to let you have a few days to yourself even if you're still staying home.", "No you aren't and after your post I can see why you need it.\nYour husband needs his eyes opened and quickly.\nI highly recommend couples counseling.. while he still has a functioning wife.... After your vacation!!!!", "NTA. My life was the same before my ex and I split. I miss my kids when they're with their dad (I work) but I actually have time to myself now. You totally deserve this trip. But your husband will sabatoge it some how if you do.", "NTA. But you do realise you have 4 kids living with you, not 3? He might be the size of an adult, but he sure is acting like your child, not your partner.", "NTA There is nothing wrong about wanting time alone and being responsible for only yourself. In fact, it could be beneficial for everyone. When people burn out, it affects everyone around them. If your partner is adamant about a whole week, perhaps they'll be amenable to a three day weekend. I hope you get a much needed break.", "NTA\n\nA week is a long time to leave a two year old, especially with someone who has never cared for them before so for their sake maybe go for a weekend. \n\nI do think you need to address the issue with a more long term solution, you can\u2019t keep going like this, your husband has to help. You work 24/7 with the children and house AND you do a part time job from home. He works 8-6 and goes to sleep at 8, your husband needs to step up and be a real partner and dad.", "ESH - not for wanting time off, I have 3 children too and I work full time, my husband works abroad/offshore so I get where you\u2019re coming from, however for all his faults my husband is amazing when he is home. I could leave for a week and everything would be fine. \n\nHowever you have allowed this imbalance to arise, you\u2019ve had 3 children and never redressed the workload. If you went away for a week it would be a nightmare for your children, your partner will not be able to cope and your children won\u2019t cope without you there and a stressed father. \n\nWhen I first moved in with my husband, he used to finish work before me and I would walk in and he would ask me what was for dinner when he had been home for 2 hours. We had the talk then and I made it clear that I wasn\u2019t his mother.\n\nYou need to build up to it, he needs to start doing more around the house. Although as a starter for 10 I\u2019d book myself a spa day and leave him with the kids for a day but you\u2019ll have to prep everything and give him a list of instructions.\n\nFrankly at this point apart from money I don\u2019t really see what your partner is contributing to the relationship.", "Girl, YWBTA to yourself if you don't go.  This man needs to experience what is like to have to manage the house and kids without you.  I try to take a girls' trip every other year. It rejuvenates me and reminds him how much I actually do around here.", "NTA You've got a roommate, not a partner", "NTA. I would be looking at a divorce while you\u2019re there tbh. One less person to run around after. If you do go though expect to have a weeks worth of housework waiting for you when you get back because he won\u2019t magically start not being completely selfish. And will blame your \u2018high standards\u2019 for doing fuck all.", "NTA, but the real issue is an inappropriate division of labor in your relationship. Your partner needs to pitch in more, or, he needs to be more willing to give you what you want in matters like this in exchange for the inequitable distribution of labor.\n\nNo relationship is 100% fifty-fifty all the time, but this is way out of whack. It sounds like work is your partner's life, and he's OK with this, but that doesn't mean you have to be. And honestly, from someone whose parents had quite a similar arrangement: your partner should consider what this may be doing to his relationship with his kids. I wish like crazy that my dad had been around more during my childhood.\n\nA week of stay-at-home dadding would do him, them, and you all some good. He should embrace it as the least he can do.", "NTA. \n\nBook the vacation, call each night only to say goodnight to the kids, and do whatever the heck you want. You\u2019re not an indentured servant. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t realize how much you do by the time you get back or blames you for anything going wrong, go to marriage counseling. \n\nWhat an absolute child, and you\u2019ve been taking care of not 3 but 4 children for a decade and don\u2019t deserve a break? WOW", "PUT HIM IN THE BIN\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou also have 4 children, not 3\n\nI can also guarantee, if you do go away, he will call you 24/7 to try and guilt and manipulate you into coming back home with the hopes youll never do it again because of how awful he made it last time", "My husband does the lions share of paid work, me the kids/house. \nI gave him the heads up that I was off to visit my friend interstate for a bit over a week during his leave and he decided to sit down and write the list of all the crap I do, appointments to keep, school activities etc. \nit took us over an hour. \nHe dropped me at the airport, got both our mums to help for the days he had plans (the stuff he booked his actual leave for) and just\u2026 got on with it. \n\nWhen he picked me up he paused and said \u201cI really appreciate all the stuff you do behind the scenes, it\u2019s a lot\u201d I got to say \u201c I really appreciate that you work your ass of so I can\u201d \n\nAnd that\u2019s how normal, healthy relationships can work. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. I let my ex wife go on a week long trip alone a year and a half in. No reason you can't have a break. Although my ex cheated on me on her trip, I would advise you against that part", "Yr NTA , having said that does having to take a week off on short notice have an impact on your husband's job . In that case you might want to move the dates ahead .\n\nSecond , is there a financial element to this situation.  Do you want from your 2 hours a day self employment. How much is the vacation cost and how does that impact your budget. Is this a consideration in your husband reaction?\n\nFinally the issue is more than the vacation. You are burning out due to workload and your grievance is that your husband does not pull his weight . Vacation or not , you should have an honest discussion on this with your husband", "Probably not going to be popular but for me, ESH.\n\nThis has nothing to do with you taking a week off and going on a vacation. You don't sound very happy in this marriage and clearly, your husband should be more involved in taking care of the kids and household chores.\n\nAlso, you don't talk about how you two split the house bills and expenses linked to the kids. If you can afford this trip because your husband is the only contributing to the bills, that changes a lot of things about the perspective you're giving us about your husband working so much.\n\nAlso, I know he's the kids's father, but why would you leave them alone with him for a week when he doesn't seem to anything about them or want to spend time with them ?", "It seems pretty odd that you wouldn't want to find child care and have your husband with you. \n\nI have let my wife go on 'girls vacations' with sister in laws and stuff like that but, if she asked me to just vacation alone without me, I'd likely find it off putting as well.\n\nwithout a crapload more context I would say NAH, since clearly this vacation idea is not much more than a bandaid idea for your other issues that you have, and since clearly it feels pretty weird for a significant other to basically be like \"I want vacation away from you\"\n\nmost people are going to say not TA here, I would suggest taking it with a grain of salt,  on such small context, because \"you can do what you want\" but... the reality in my opinion is a bit more contextual about how relationships and feelings *actually* work.  \n\nSometimes just because we all have the ability to 'do what we want' doesn't mean it's actually the best idea for a relationship.  Especially one that you didn't say a single good thing about this guy.", "NTA. Book the vacation it's not selfish to want a break. Your on-SAHM duty 24/7 while he is neglecting his share of childcare and household chores. He needs to contribute to the household and childcare more. Take the vacation and give him a taste of what being full time SAHM is like.", "I dunno. I struggle with the whole wanting a break from your kids. You chose this, they didn't. \n\nI definitely think your husband should pitch in more.", "NTA\n\nCan you counter it with, if I can do this, you can go on a boys trip for a week without me and the kids? Would he even consider that?", "I don\u2019t think taking care of your children should count as a job. You chose to have them so it\u2019s at least the bare minimum you should do is look after the kids you chose to bring into this world. That\u2019s what you signed up for. Now your husband needs to pitch in more. If he\u2019s tired after work, so what? When you decide to have children, looking after them doesn\u2019t have a start or finish time. He needs to realize that he had a part to play in having kids and being tired isn\u2019t an excuse to dump the work load on you. More than a vacation, you need couples therapy. I understand you are burned out but let\u2019s say you do go on vacation and nothing changes, you\u2019ll just end up counting the days until the next vacation. I feel getting him to pitch in more and help more when it comes to dealing with the kids. I feel if he chips in more, you can get your rest here and there while he takes over. Cause when things are as one sided as they are, I could see it not only burning you out, but I could see some type of resentment brewing against your family cause although he\u2019s there, it seems (from this post) you doing most of the heavy lifting alone.", "You sound as though what you really want is to show your husband how difficult it is to do everything that you do, which is understandable, but your children are very young.  If you're not 100% certain that your husband is practicing weaponized incompetence, then you are jeopardizing the children's well-being and potentially traumatizing them, for an entire week.  \n\nYeesh, I'm going with ESH, adults only, of course.", "INFO how much money do each of you make?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And women take on almost all of the emotional labor even when they work an outside job that is equal to the number of hours of their husband.\n\nThis is changing slowly but men got married so that they have a partner and not a mother. Their wife shouldn\u2019t need to tell them what to do constantly. They should look around and do some things. Yes, there needs to be communication but there are some individuals who also need to pull their heads out of their asses.", "don\u2019t you see? what is true = misandry", "So he can rest, but she can't? She works more than 50 hours a day. His job stops when he gets home, and hers doesn't. She takes care of the kids with little to no help, works on her business, and takes care of the household. When does she clock out? Never. He has to help regardless of how many hours he works. He's a father, parenthood doesn't stop because you're tired from work. She does a lot more than he does when you think about it. She deserves to rest, and he should experience what she does all the time for at least a week. It won't kill him, he'll be fine.", "oh, here\u2019s the husband.", "I would definitely hope so. But I know very little of US law myself, nonetheless UK law.", "How is this out of touch?\n\nShe pays half the bills (possibly more).\n\nShe makes 2/3 his income on part time work and could make double his salary if she went full time.  \n\nShe does ***all*** the household work.  \n\nShe only works after the kids are asleep.  \n\nThe husband only ***sometimes*** does the fun stuff with the kids and some times just leaves to do his own thing for hours.  \n\nHow is she not a servant?  She's not a SAHM.  SHE WORKS FROM HOME.", "Yes, it's her responsibility to make sure that the man she is marrying and procreating with isn't a complete deadbeat! What a novel concept! It's not on her to change him, it's on her to say \"I want to be a partner, not a maid\" and leave. \n\nShe could have left 10 years ago, find a normal guy and have a partnership, but chose to stay and have THREE WHOLE HUMANS with a complete waste of space.\n\nShe's responsible for herself and her own choices.", "OP refers to him as partner and says they have been together 12 years but does not mention marriage so I assumed they are not married. But yeah you\u2019re right, either way he is taking advantage. \n\nEdit: just realised I said divorce in my original comment, at first I put \u201csplit\u201d but didn\u2019t know if this was a British term or not by everyone \ud83d\ude02 so changed it", "You are downright begging a person you dont know more than about 14 sentences, to leave 3 kids mostly fatherless. \n\nYou clearly won't,  but you should think about what you are doing.  You aren't a good person.", "Women not slaves = man hating", "It's not a competition of how tired each of them are again it's about being a team and working through issues together. \n\nThey both deserve a rest. Maybe go away together and get someone to look after the kids. \n\nI have 100% said he needs to prioritise home over work. I believe doesn't WANT to miss out on his children's life. I am replying to the comment that says he is a deadbeat dad. There are a lot of deadbeat dads out there and he is not one of them.", "Because I don't think someone working full-time falling asleep from exhaustion at 8pm is a deadbeat. \n\nHe needs to do better but it doesn't seem like a lack of try maybe trying in the wrong places.", "Their father wants her to take them to her PAP SMEAR because he can\u2019t handle them for an hour and a half. With a dad like that they are basically fatherless.", "It's not the wife's \"job\" to train and \"raise\" the husband. He should be intelligent and engaged enough to understand that childcare and 100% responsibility for the care of the home should be shared.\n\nIn the 19th century, there were SEVERAL servants doing these tasks. Now women have the total responsibility for both home and kids PLUS holding a job. This is NOT advancing culture. It's using women as employees and if they complain, they are called \"selfish\".  There are genuine statistics on what a SAHM would get paid in today's dollars:\n\nSalary.com estimated that if stay-at-home parents earned an annual salary for all the jobs they performed on a daily basis in 2020 and 2021, the median would exceed $184,000.", "You can be a great provider and a deadbeat father. When does he spend time with his kids? When does he give his wife time to rest? When does he do his half of the household shores? He isn't. So he is being a deadbeat father/husband. He can be both.", "Exactly. 7 years doing all the child rearing for *multiple* children plus having a job. That\u2019s a lot!", "Should probably seek counseling and not listen to 13 year olds on the internet telling them to divorce him cause then st least she will only have to be a part time mom and have a part time dad too.", "It is her job to treat him as a partner. Letting him do nothing not sharing income equally and having no responsibility with the kidsis damaging. To her, him and their kids\n\nIm not saying she should do everything im saying she should tell him what he should do if he is too stupid to do it himself. Talk, explain that you expect more responsibility taking from him. \n\nTreating a partner as a child and not a partner is damaging. If you have done so the correct way to fix it is through communication and guidance.", "Yeah, sounds like another thing OP would have to figure out and organize and force him to do. \n\nMay as well save herself the trouble. He barely contributes as it is. She could easily do it without him. She already is! She even pays most of the bills!", "It's NOT \"her job\" to teach him anything. Geez, the freaking arrogance!\n\nGet this through your skull: NO ONE TAUGHT HER SHIT. She learned by doing and so can he.", "Yup part time parents sounds great based on the 11 sentences you heard.  Eesh....", "You dont think she enabled the behavior?", "Classic_Ingenuity that guy isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t understand how \u201ctelling him what to do\u201d and \u201cteaching him what to do\u201d isn\u2019t the same as treating the his and like a child. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that he, sorry, husbands, need to be able to look around and recognize on their own that some things need done.", "LOL you think that guy would want any physical custody? He wants her to take them to the doctor- can\u2019t parent for two hours. \n\nYou are very, very funny.\n\nEDIT: because you are very sensitive about your sense of humor I guess and blocked me- I\u2019m 38 years old, I\u2019m married and have children. I\u2019ve seen these situations play out countless times in real life- rarely, when the woman actually leaves, does she regret it. She doesn\u2019t have a partner. She has an albatross around her neck."]}
