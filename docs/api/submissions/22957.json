That way you don't have to deal with her anymore and she can pin the failure/frustration of the dress on someone else. \n\nabove all, i just encourage you to try to find a peaceful resolution here. avoiding drama has its own value.

Not informing you of her pregnancy bc it\u2019s a secret is stupid. Why would she confirm measurements knowing they wouldn\u2019t work. That\u2019s a totally a jerk move.

And charging overtime is especially acceptable.", "NTA She is responsible for the stress of not having a fitting dress herself. You're right, she should have told you.", "NTA.

Stand your ground.", "Wow. Absolutely NTA. I think you\u2019re still being incredibly generous.

I think she made a poor decision by not telling you and keeping it a secret, and hopes that you will feel bad and give in. It's an unfortunate situation but she ought to have told you so that you could make adjustments. And you are giving her discounts on the dress which she doesn't get to dictate (\"she will only pay for materials\"). Just my two cents. Best wishes!", "NTA.
