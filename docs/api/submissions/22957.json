That way you don't have to deal with her anymore and she can pin the failure/frustration of the dress on someone else. \n\nabove all, i just encourage you to try to find a peaceful resolution here. avoiding drama has its own value.

Not informing you of her pregnancy bc it\u2019s a secret is stupid. Why would she confirm measurements knowing they wouldn\u2019t work. That\u2019s a totally a jerk move.

And charging overtime is especially acceptable.", "NTA She is responsible for the stress of not having a fitting dress herself. You're right, she should have told you.", "NTA.

She wanted to be a surprise!!! She got one by keeping her pregnancy private.  Estupid.", "NTA. At all. I get the keeping it a secret until 12 weeks, because that is the most dangerous time for a pregnancy.

As a result, we only had the minimum amount of people present for the wedding to legally count, so my wife really didn't get to show her wedding dress--a minor raw straw in her craw that's been bugging her (and by extension, me) for a couple years now. Now that the pandemic's over and we don't really have to put up with all the regulatory BS having an actual wedding reception would have entailed during that time, we've been giving thought to maybe having one.\n\nProblem is, in the few years since we've been legally married, my wife's body has changed a lot--mostly in that she's gone from being almost as rail-skinny as me, barely able to fit into my jeans, to now having THE GREATEST HIPS IN THE WORLD (\u2122\ufe0f), along with a bust that is almost double the size it is now (and before the idiots start commenting, no, this did not involve surgery). Not a problem for me, mind you--I very much enjoy these developments--however, it means that her wedding dress doesn't fit her anymore.\n\nI asked what retailoring it to fit would entail.

They could sell that dress back to you or to someone else, and/or buy a plus size wedding gown and alter it to fit her. Maybe you could help do that if they buy the second dress.", "I'm on the fence with this one. I don't think you're the AH because yes that's a lot of extra time on you and of course materials. However I don't think she's the AH either because a lot of doctors tell you to not tell anybody you're pregnant until you've reached the first trimester because it's so easy to miscarry. So honestly in her first trimester she might not even known if she would still be pregnant by this point. I think maybe you two can reach a compromise? Or at least try and be a little bit understanding of the position she was in as well.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not being cruel; you're being practical. You're the one who put the work to make a gorgeous gown, not Lucy. And like you said, she should have told you earlier so you could have made adjustments earlier. Making dresses isn't easy, it takes time and skill, skill which Lucy doesn't appreciate.", "NTA!  NTA!!   NTA!!!   \nShe purposely withheld information crucial to the fit of her custom made wedding gown and she expects you to make another one without being compensated??   \nYour cousin is an AH and your aunt is an AH, too.  Lucy is upset because she made a completely ridiculous decision to hide her pregnancy from her dressmaker - the one person who really had to know. It's so absurd that I don't know how anyone can defend her.", "NTA. When you have ordered custom clothing for an occasion, and you are not smart enough to let them know you are going to be 20 weeks pregnant when the time comes to wear it, you are not very smart. When that clothing was made for free, and you expect them to make you another one for free you have lost your freaking mind. To expect you to make another dress for free and do it outside your normal business, and in just 2 months' time, shows just how entitled she really thinks she is.", "How stupid your cousin can be?? Frrr you told her the dress wouldn\u2019t fut her then and she straight up told you that she knew!!! All this time your cousin knew you will eventually have to make changes to the dress after almost finishing it the audacity and idiocity. I would be mad and refuse to make her another dress tbh. She needs to come back down the real world and things don\u2019t magically happen", "NTA\n\nIt's extra work for you, and she had plenty of time to give you advance notice.", "NTA time, labour and materials have to be paid for. She can always get dresses from plenty of sources, it's not like you are leaving her naked.", "NTA.\n\nShe had to have know how much work you were putting in to a custom designed dress for *her* for free, but didn\u2019t have the courtesy to give you a heads up. People who don\u2019t value the time and effort of others really bring \u201cstress\u201d upon themselves when someone calls them on their bs.\n\nI can understand not advertising a new pregnancy given the chance of miscarriage in the first trimester but she could have, at the very least said\u2026cuz, you need to put a pause on making the dress.", "NTA.  How do you not realise that a baby bump is going to be a significant change in your figure?  She knew very well you were making this dress from scratch, so she should have said something earlier.  I assume it wouldn't be the first time you heard such a thing, and that you have experience dealing with a bride whose very shape is changing right up to the day of the wedding - not just the bump, but any additional weight she puts on.    If she wants a second dress, she has to pay for it.  Fair enough.", "NTA wanting to keep a special secret isn\u2019t a good enough reason to rob your friends", "You are NTA. It\u2019s absurd that she didn\u2019t tell you and allowed sewing and fitting to continue knowing it ultimately wouldn\u2019t fit. Please do not back down. After everything is said and done,she\u2019s a fool who could\u2019ve had a beautiful dress that fits AS A GIFT.", "My bump wasn\u2019t the problem when trying to fit in my clothes at 20 weeks, my boobs however\u2026 Trouble is, it is impossible to tell at 12 weeks what your body will look like at 20 weeks, as it can literally pop overnight. Had OP known about this 2 months ago, she could have changed the design in order to take this into account.", "Lol", "what makes this a flat NTA* for me is that the cousin knew she was pregnant and probably has known for 4-6 weeks.  Yet she continued to let OP spend time and money working on a dress that she knew wasn't going to fit her.  Legit wasted her time, and doesn't think that OP needs to be paid for that.", "I ended up having to put my foot down and told my parents flat out I would no longer be their computer consultant for their business and they needed to hire a professional. The main reason was they kept removing all the network security I would add onto their network... cause you know.. their entire accounting database was on it.", "> Trust OP's expertise that the dress can't be altered, since she's the one who made it.\n\nYeah, but sometimes the Customer\u2122 has to hear it from somebody else before they'll believe it.", "Yeah I actually wonder if OP could display it for someone else to buy to recoup the costs", "So, implied ad hominems? Great", "What? You must mean NTA, right? If you think OP isn\u2019t TA.", "oops yes, lol.  I was mad for OP and fixated on the cousin being a total ass.  \n\nThank you, i will edit!!", "And expect them to just shrug it off and work overtime for free. I can't even.", "I'm not sure that would work, depending on the style. And just going up a size or two won't leave room for the bump while still increasing the size of everything else that might not need to be altered at all. For example, the arm holes might be too big now \n\nYou can never be sure how much weight will be gained, nor where the weight will go. Even each pregnancy is different. Some people don't seem to gain a single pound except for a bump and others will gain a lot of weight everywhere.", "Alright, but how many calls are you getting from your relatives that are anything more than setting up their computer or installing an antivirus?", "You're right. Seriously the bride should get a photo of herself in it in the event she really can't wear it on her wedding.  At least this way she can see herself in it.  Maybe wear it for wedding renewal in 10 years?", "Wrong.\n\nIf OP had been categorically asking her about weight/pregnancy related concerns, she would have said so in the post, instead of that weasel phrase."]}
