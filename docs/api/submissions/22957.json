You understand where she is coming from, obviously, but she doesn't seem to understand where YOU are coming from. Making a second dress is expensive, both in money and time.", "NTA - you are making two dresses, and the second on a very tight schedule.  For her to expect you to donate all the labor for a second dress is so entitled as to be frightening!!!", "NTA, reminds me of one of my favorite sayings. Failure to plan on your part does not constitute and emergency on my part.", "NTA. You said you\u2019d make her a wedding dress. You have. You didn\u2019t say you\u2019d make her multiple wedding dresses at twice the financial and time cost.", "NTA.  The first dress was a gift. The second dress is not. I agree with another commenter. Give her the first dress, let her find someone who will alter it, since she thinks it's so simple. But not the sketch.  That's yours.", "NTA.\n\nyou gave her a free wedding dress. I think it's fine to say \"i don't have time and resources to make a completely new wedding dress for free\".\n\nBut, I would give her the dress that you made and give her the option to go to someone else to get it tailored, if she's stuck on that.  That way you don't have to deal with her anymore and she can pin the failure/frustration of the dress on someone else. \n\nabove all, i just encourage you to try to find a peaceful resolution here. avoiding drama has its own value. Not saying do work for free, but have a meeting with her, her mother and her fiance and really try to find a resolution - and help them to understand your limitations and all the work you've done out of kindness up to this point.", "I think most people don't want to tell about a pregnancy until 12th week or so because there can be miscarriage, so I kind of understand where she's coming from. But of course she should be willing to pay for the extra work or buy another wedding dress. NTA.", "I hate selfish people. Your time and labor should be valued and compensated. NTA. and do not make her a new dress. She can go get one off the rack.", "Nta . She is perfectly capable of purchasing a wedding dress on her own like every other bride. Having a cousin that owns a bridal shop is a perk most brides don\u2019t have. Having your cousin who owns a bridal shop HANDMAKING a personalized dress, who has thoughtfully touched base multiple times in the process is an absolute honor. Not informing you of her pregnancy bc it\u2019s a secret is stupid. Why would she confirm measurements knowing they wouldn\u2019t work. That\u2019s a totally a jerk move. Wasting your time, talent, material, kindness and labor. I would even remake the dress tbh. If anyone scolds you for it tell them they are more than welcome to make the dress for her.", "NTA. She is not entitled to free stuff, you\u2019re going out of your way for her as it is.  If you worked at Walmart would they expect free food and TV\u2019s?\n\nAnd one thing you could start doing to make your life easier is telling all new clients: \u201cHey if you get pregnant before the wedding, let me know and I can keep it confidential.  I will need to know right away so I can make adjustments.\u201d  Again you did nothing wrong but might as well make life easier on yourself as a result.", "NTA. \"She said she will be only pay for materials\". Lol that's not up to her.", "NTA. They are being disrespectful of your time, effort and craft.", "Nta. How selfish of her to think she shouldn't have to pay. Beadwork is insanely hard (I can't even do like, a simple design necklace) and redoing all that in a short amount of time is absolutely worth being paid for,especially since the first is already complete.  And charging overtime is especially acceptable.", "NTA She is responsible for the stress of not having a fitting dress herself. You're right, she should have told you.", "NTA. She's just trying to take advantage of your kindness because you're family. I doubt she'd have tried to pull this kind of stunt with a dressmaker she wasn't related to.", "She should have told you 10 weeks ago so you had time to alter the alter dress that you a gifting her. So yeah now she needs pay for the rush job of another dress.", "NTA", "NTA. Where is this entitlement coming from? How are so many people raising their children this way? Your aunt is acting the same as your cousin so you see where she gets it from. The stress is your cousin's fault.\n\nThe dress sounds beautiful.", "NTA\n\nGive her back the money she paid for materials and wish her well finding a new dress.", " NTA\u2026. That is the problem with entitle people. She likely thinks ur job is a piece of cake because you offered to gift her the first dress.  So for her, putting your on a crunch and having to do the work another time doesn\u2019t matter cause you gifted her your time the first time.\n\nDon\u2019t back down. This is ur business and you don\u2019t have to kill yourself at work for her. Understand their view about keeping the pregnancy a secret but well it something that has a serious impact on that dress which again she is taking the work as too lightly or thought you would bend back and front for her. \n\nWhat would she have done if she was paying someone else a ton of money for the dress? Inform the person cause she wouldn\u2019t want to waste her money", "NTA - I was fully prepared to say otherwise but she knowingly did you dirty and expected you to just go along with it because she\u2019s the bride and she\u2019s pregnant. Neither gives anyone a free ride to be disrespectful of someone\u2019s time and money.", "NTA. Does she think David's Bridal would just fork over an upsized dress at no cost to her after her original purchase has been altered? Ha! The audacity of her to assume that because you have a personal relationship that you should eat the costs and donate your time to make her a whole new dress. The nerve.", "NTA she should have told you she was pregnant when she found out. I understand wanting to keep it s secret from family but this interfered with her dress for her wedding.", "NTA. She wanted to be a surprise!!! She got one by keeping her pregnancy private.  Estupid.", "NTA. At all. I get the keeping it a secret until 12 weeks, because that is the most dangerous time for a pregnancy. But situations that a pregnancy may change the circumstances of, affected parties should know ASAP. \n\nMost people I know (including myself 2x) aren\u2019t heavily showing at 20 weeks - I just went back and looked at photos of myself at 20 weeks and I had to pull my shirts tight to my stomach to see the \u201cbump\u201d - perhaps it won\u2019t be an extreme showing at that time (trying to be positive here lol)?", "NTA. This is her problem, not yours. You did the first dress because you wanted to. She has to pay full price/family discount price for the second. Not only for materials.", "NTA.\n\nShe was stupid and selfish.", "Hi actions, meet consequences.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but also she may fit into the dress at 20 weeks \ud83e\udd37 not everyone is showing a whole bunch at that point especially with their first.", "NTA", "I would finish and give her the original dress since that is the gift.  \n\nThen she can choose what to do from there.

They blame you not knowing a darn thing about your job.\n\nNTA", "Lol NTA. What a dummy.", "NTA", "NTA, regardless of them wanting to keep it secret, they knew you were making a dress to her specific measurements. They basically tried to get you to gift two dresses.", "NTA.
