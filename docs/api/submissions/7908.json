Are you expected to dine out until you lose your home, or what? \n\nIf you want to help your friend, perhaps you could offer to help her find work in a more stable field, or perhaps you could hire her directly, for your own projects, etc. Waitpeople are generally some of the most focused, hardest working, most organized workers around.", "NTA.\nAnd tbh I would have asked her to leave.

Had a buddy in  similar situation that worked at Texas roadhouse.  I tip when i go out to eat but even at 15%, inflation has just made the pricing unreasonable.  Just a $13 curry plate, $3 side of naan, and a $2 drink puts me at $22 for a single meal after tax and tip.  What used to be an everyday thing for people has become a special occasion and the industry is failing or refusing to adjust.  The places doing real well that cater to the average joe are the one's who have pared down their menus and have focused on substance over style.  A small diner in my town hasn't changed asethetically since the 70's except for when they replaced all the upholstery (soon after smoking was banned in businesses) and they havent had any issues staying open.

Yes, tipped minimum is $2.13 but employers are required by federal law to supplement your wages if you don\u2019t earn that on average over a pay period. As long as your employer is following federal law (another topic entirely), every employee is making $7.25 even if their tips are lower. \n\nFor states that allow tip credits (which is most of them) employers can consider your tipped wages as part of the wages they pay you. For example- At my job, which isn\u2019t a restaurant but in a similar industry, I have several job codes I use regularly ranging from $5.25-10/hour. They\u2019re all tipped positions except 1. On each check, they deduct anywhere from $75-$260 from what should be my hourly pay, including OT since I made tips.\n\nThis is totally legal under federal law. My company recently started using this loophole after a change in state law and it\u2019s had a noticeable effect on my checks. For the record, this impacts salaried managers too- their tips are deducted out of their salary pay. Granted, each state makes their own laws regarding tip credits so this might not exactly applicable across the board , but gives you an idea of the situation. \n\nLast time I checked, the only states that don\u2019t allow tip credits are NY & CA. The minimum wage in those states are around $15, so employers are required to pay you that + tips. Working in CA was the first time I ever got real checks serving or bartending. I liked this because it forced employers to respect you and your time as a side effect- in TX they have no problem with over staffing a shift and making people wait around while making no money and regularly having staff stay until 4-6 a.m. cleaning- because they\u2019re only paying you $2.14. In CA, at least where I worked they diligently made cuts to manage their labor costs and got people out of the door at the end of a shift. Staff wasn\u2019t responsible for deep cleaning. \n\nI agree with you that raising federal minimum wage and abolishing tipped minimum wage needs to happen, but as it stands with states being able to establish their own tip credit minimums, employers would still be able to undercut their tipped employees. \n\nObviously OP is NTA, but this whole tip credit situation is fucked and I feel for her friend.

Knock-on effect, though, is now these businesses either hire staff outright at a wage that can pay their bills and keep them working... Or they don't have wait staff. Without wait staff, they don't operate, and they don't make money. Which kicks the companies right in the wallet, the only spot they can actually feel anything. And the economic ramifications of a whole sector of the economy potentially crashing demands action by those in charge, aka reforming this tipped wage nonsense.\n\nWhen tips are an expected standard practice, the customer is, in effect, just subsidizing the company payroll. Not receiving a tip from a customer is a slight, you just docked their pay. And the company gets to pay at most, minimum wage. And usually quite a bit less. (Yes, I know there are plenty of tip earning staff that have a base wage that's higher than that minimum tip wage. Too many of them don't, however.)\n\nWhen tips are accepted as optional, gifted by a customer for what they felt was great service, now it's a bonus. They get some extra money, feel goods, and motivation. And if they don't get a tip?
