It is not your job to ensure people are making a living wage unless you are their employer.", "NTA. It's unfortunate for her, but it's not anyone's responsibility to prop up a non-essntial industry like restaurants.

Are you expected to dine out until you lose your home, or what? \n\nIf you want to help your friend, perhaps you could offer to help her find work in a more stable field, or perhaps you could hire her directly, for your own projects, etc. Waitpeople are generally some of the most focused, hardest working, most organized workers around.", "NTA.\nAnd tbh I would have asked her to leave.

Nah...you go home now, bye. \n\nIf her current job isn't paying sufficiently then she needs to start working towards finding one that does.", "NTA.

Had a buddy in  similar situation that worked at Texas roadhouse.  I tip when i go out to eat but even at 15%, inflation has just made the pricing unreasonable.  Just a $13 curry plate, $3 side of naan, and a $2 drink puts me at $22 for a single meal after tax and tip.  What used to be an everyday thing for people has become a special occasion and the industry is failing or refusing to adjust.  The places doing real well that cater to the average joe are the one's who have pared down their menus and have focused on substance over style.  A small diner in my town hasn't changed asethetically since the 70's except for when they replaced all the upholstery (soon after smoking was banned in businesses) and they havent had any issues staying open.

Then you have places like Toronto and Vancouver where the average price is over a million.", "Doesn't factor in. It's about the disparity of income between someone who has a good job and someone who is trying to get by waitressing. The good income earner doesn't value dining out as the waitress needs people to be dining out to secure an income", "Not my problem. I'm not some recruitment/placement agency. I'm not some CV-coach. \n\n>\tNot happy with *your own* pay, *you* fix it. \n\nI don't know how I could be any clearer.", "Actually every state\n\ntechnically requires employers to pay minimum wage. It\u2019s federal\n\nlaw. There\u2019s two states (IIRC, NY & CA) that require employers to pay tipped employees state minimim\n\nwage, sbout $15in both states.\n\nBut even in states that allow employers to use tip credits to supplement minimim wage, the employer has to make up the dofference. So at te end of the pay period, if you don\u2019t make at least $7.25 (federal minimum wage) your employer has to pay you the dodference so you\u2019re making at least minimum. The true didference is NY & CA have higher minimum wages than most of the country. For the record, I\u2019ve worked in both and IMO people do tip less when they know you\u2019re making $15/hr + tips. And to answer your question about boycotting- for one, most ofthe states with tip credits are also right to work states, so you could simply get fired fof unionizing or kicking ip a fuss. Sevondly, though the pay model is fucked it tends to work out in the tipped employee\u2019s favor. If tipped employees foughg for just minimum aid, it would essentially be advocating for less pay. Most of this I would blame on federal laws. States getting away with fucking their employees as  much as the federal government will let them. If federal minimum wage was updated to reflect two decades of inflation, we wouldn\u2018t be having this conversation at all", "Im in Quebec where it's the same minimum wage for everyone. And right now that wage is $14.25 (Going up to $15.25 in May)\n\nAnd the expectation of tips just keeps growing. (and now its all the card readers with their sneaky \"auto\" tips added on showing up every where too)", "I love tipping. I work for tips (on top of a standard wage yay), and I love tipping when I go out. But I agree it has become insane. I heard an employee say \u201cwow are you kidding me\u201d when I only tipped $2, but it was a pizza place and I was picking it up myself! I always tell customers I appreciate it but I don\u2019t need it, unless the order is insane I never expect a tip. I already make a normal wage, that tip is supposed to be a perk. A single dollar every few customers is enough to make me happy. Why is it suddenly the default to tip 10%+ for service no matter the job?"]}
