She accepted and we headed over to our house. There she asked why I haven\u2019t gone to her restaurant in a while. She works for a nice restaurant in town and we use to frequent because she got an employee discount. I told her I pretty much stopped going to restaurants completely. She asked me why and I told her inflation and the expectation to tip 20% at least has made restaurant food ridiculously expensive. She got annoyed and told me I could afford it I live in a million dollar house. My husband and I make good money but I don\u2019t see why that means I have to go to restaurants. I told her the main thing at restaurants I like to order (steak) is now $50 for a mediocre one. I can get a top quality rib eye for $30 that I can cook in compound butter and fresh rosemary. She made a face and told me that people with money that don\u2019t have children should be helping prop up the industry and complaining about tipping when I\u2019m doing well. I felt attacked and told her I\u2019m doing what everyone\u2019s advice is, if I can\u2019t tip enough not to go out. I\u2019m annoyed by how high tipping has gotten we don\u2019t even live in the us we live in Canada. She told me the restaurants can\u2019t even hire enough waitresses now so even with tips most people don\u2019t make enough serving. I told her it\u2019s not my problem if they don\u2019t make enough it\u2019s their bosses job to pay them and when I do eat out I tip what is expected. She got really mad told me I should be more sympathetic to her since she can barely pay her bills waitressing since less people are eating out and tipping and refused to talk to me while we ate.", "created_utc": 1674316983, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10huhpw/aita_for_saying_its_not_my_problem_if_my_friend/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also not your fault that (according to her) people are eating out less. \n\nIf she wants to make a better living, find a better job.", "NTA- I like how you acknowledge that you eat at restaurants only if you can pay a proper tip which is respectful. Not everyone can afford or wants to eat out regularly and your friend shouldn\u2019t take that personally.", "NTA.  Your friend has a lot of nerve telling you what to do with the money you've earned.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s delusional. Food is expensive right now and restaurants are a luxury, not a necessity.", "NTA. Eating out has gotten more expensive. You, like many, many other people, have chosen to eat out less often.\n\nYour waitress friend is struggling to pay her bills because of a macro-economic trend. She can pressure you all she wants, but you will not be able to single-handedly prop up the economy enough to improve her situation.\n\nWhat reaction was she hoping for? That you would starting giving her $40 each week? \"Let's just pretend I went to the restaurant you work at and this is your tip.\"", "NTA\n\nShe sounds entitled and extremely delusional. It doesn\u2019t matter how much money y\u2019all have. You\u2019re allowed to want to reduce your costs. She\u2019s not entitled to a 20% tip from you and it\u2019s not your fault she is working in an industry hell bent on ripping people off right now.", "NTA. This is something I've read about where they do try to convince servers the problem is the guests not tipping enough when the real problem is server wage is a joke (I'm in Canada too)  Your friend is being super unreasonable. They are demanding you go out eat sub par food and over pay for it to benefit the people not being paid a far wage by their employer. It is not your job to ensure people are making a living wage unless you are their employer.", "NTA. It's unfortunate for her, but it's not anyone's responsibility to prop up a non-essntial industry like restaurants. Not only is the food more expensive, it's usually less healthy than what you could make at home, and they waste a lot of food.  \n\nSlight tangent: In the spring of 2020, Canadian potato farmers were advised to plant 15% less because there was so much less waste from restaurants being closed or doing less business. People didn't suddenly stop eating potatoes. There was just that much less waste.  \n\nI worked as a waitress for a decade, and it definitely sucks both the job and the pay.", "NTA the economic situation and restaurants reticence to pay a living wage are not your sole responsibility. Good for you for being sensible", "NTA. Based on the title I was expecting a Y T A, thinking you were going to be judgemental about her job, but this is mostly about her ridiculous expectation that because you can afford to eat at restaurants you are obliged to do so. \n\nIt\u2019s your money. Spend it or don\u2019t spend it as you like. And you are right - with the cost of everything going up you can often have better and healthier food by making it yourself.", "NTA. You're both victims of rampant capitalism. I completely understand you not wanting to spend so much money on a meal at a restaurant, when you can easily make the same thing at home for much less money. It isn't your responsibility to \"prop up the industry\".\n\nBut I do understand it must be really hard for her when she can't really pay her bills because people aren't going to restaurants as much. Especially when she can see that you're financially doing just fine. She's frustrated and desperate, and although she shouldn't be taking her frustrations out on you, I get why she's frustrated.\n\nReally, TBATA (the billionaires are the assholes).", "NTA. To me it just sounds like she wants you to go where she works so you can tip her. You aren\u2019t her employer and it\u2019s not your job to pay her. She also has no right to tell you how and where you should be spending your money. I am sympathetic to your friend\u2019s problem, but she could get another job or hopefully a higher paying job, and it\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure her bills are paid.", "Nta. Shes mad about money and letting to over flow into other issues.", "NTA. Ummm it\u2019s not your fault for wanting to spend your money wisely and cook at home. If she wants to make more money she needs to switch industries because no one has ever bank rolled waiting tables (I used to be a server).", "NTA she should get another job if that\u2019s how she feels.", "NTA, it sounds like she's frustrated by the situation, and not you specifically, or she doesn't understand that just because you have assets doesn't mean you can afford to go out all the time and tip people what they're worth. You're correct that it is on her boss to pay her what she deserves, but it isn't always that simple.", "NTA. She asked questions then got angry at your honest answers. It's not your fault your response hit a nerve with her. \n\nIt's pretty entitled of her to float the idea that it's somehow your responsibility to support her industry because you continue to be financially stable while her entire industry is increasingly destabilized due to high inflation globally. I mean, just how much money do you have? And where's the cut-off? Are you expected to dine out until you lose your home, or what? \n\nIf you want to help your friend, perhaps you could offer to help her find work in a more stable field, or perhaps you could hire her directly, for your own projects, etc. Waitpeople are generally some of the most focused, hardest working, most organized workers around.", "NTA.\nAnd tbh I would have asked her to leave. The way she talked to you, yet stuck around for the meal? Nah...you go home now, bye. \n\nIf her current job isn't paying sufficiently then she needs to start working towards finding one that does.", "NTA. She clearly has issues with her income and is lashing out at you. I don't honestly think she has a problem with you specifically, you're just a convenient target while she's p\\*ssed off.", "NTA. You\u2019re just expressing that you\u2019re trying to be smart with your money, and you really don\u2019t have an obligation to eat out. She\u2019s probably suffering financial insecurity and lashing out. The insecurity is a reason to be sympathetic toward her, but it\u2019s not fair to put the onus on you to pay waitress\u2019s and other restaurant employees\u2019 bills.", "NTA. Servers in Canada make minimum wage. If she can't afford to live on her income--like many Canadians can't--then she needs to get a second job, get a new job, or change her lifestyle. It's incredibly shitty that so many Canadians are in that position, but that's the current reality.\n\nTipping in Canada has also gotten wildly out of control, and you're not an asshole for deciding to stop eating out when the price of food and expected tip amounts have spiralled so high.", "NTA \nYou\u2019re not the cause of her economic problems", "NTA, and your friend is not a very good friend. \n\n\"While I sit here enjoying the free meal you're giving me, I'm going to take the opportunity to berate you and guilt trip you for not letting me wait on you, so you can give me money...\"  That's not a friend.", "NTA.  I get that they might be having a hard time, but to give you a hard time about anything while you're making them a meal is a dick move.  Regardless of your own situation, it's not on you to prop up the service industry and if your friend doesn't understand that there's not much you can do.\n\nEdit: apparently proofreading is hard when you start to rely on autocorrect", "NTA she\u2019s taking her problems out on you when you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. Holy shit she is in your house eating your food and throwing a tantrum that you won\u2019t give her money?  I would lose her number.", "NTA. this is also why I stopped eating out, it just isn\u2019t appealing anymore when I think about how it\u2019s more unhealthy, more expensive, and more likely to not taste how I want it to. \n\nNow I\u2019m all for wealth redistribution, but you owning a nice house does not make you Space Cowboy Bezos rich, so you have literally zero obligation to do ANYTHING. \n\nThat being said, your friend would have been LESS rude if she just outright asked for $30 since she was basically begging you to come eat at her restaurant so you could tip her. \n\nNo one is obligated to spend their money on extras. Dining out is ALWAYS the first to go when budgeting because it\u2019s so obviously a nice extra thing and not a need.", "NTA. It's your money to budget as you choose.  It is ridiculous to blame you for not wanting to waste it on indulgences.", "She\u2019s jealous and resentful that you have more than her.", "NTA.  Had a buddy in  similar situation that worked at Texas roadhouse.  I tip when i go out to eat but even at 15%, inflation has just made the pricing unreasonable.  Just a $13 curry plate, $3 side of naan, and a $2 drink puts me at $22 for a single meal after tax and tip.  What used to be an everyday thing for people has become a special occasion and the industry is failing or refusing to adjust.  The places doing real well that cater to the average joe are the one's who have pared down their menus and have focused on substance over style.  A small diner in my town hasn't changed asethetically since the 70's except for when they replaced all the upholstery (soon after smoking was banned in businesses) and they havent had any issues staying open.  The food is simple, tasty, and reasonably priced.  \n\n\nSide note, I love how she was apparently able to complain with that home cooked meal in her mouth.  Maybe you should have asked for a tip, lol.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
