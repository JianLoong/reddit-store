Are you expected to dine out until you lose your home, or what? \n\nIf you want to help your friend, perhaps you could offer to help her find work in a more stable field, or perhaps you could hire her directly, for your own projects, etc. Waitpeople are generally some of the most focused, hardest working, most organized workers around.", "NTA.\nAnd tbh I would have asked her to leave.

Had a buddy in  similar situation that worked at Texas roadhouse.  I tip when i go out to eat but even at 15%, inflation has just made the pricing unreasonable.  Just a $13 curry plate, $3 side of naan, and a $2 drink puts me at $22 for a single meal after tax and tip.  What used to be an everyday thing for people has become a special occasion and the industry is failing or refusing to adjust.  The places doing real well that cater to the average joe are the one's who have pared down their menus and have focused on substance over style.  A small diner in my town hasn't changed asethetically since the 70's except for when they replaced all the upholstery (soon after smoking was banned in businesses) and they havent had any issues staying open.

Yes, tipped minimum is $2.13 but employers are required by federal law to supplement your wages if you don\u2019t earn that on average over a pay period. As long as your employer is following federal law (another topic entirely), every employee is making $7.25 even if their tips are lower. \n\nFor states that allow tip credits (which is most of them) employers can consider your tipped wages as part of the wages they pay you. For example- At my job, which isn\u2019t a restaurant but in a similar industry, I have several job codes I use regularly ranging from $5.25-10/hour. They\u2019re all tipped positions except 1. On each check, they deduct anywhere from $75-$260 from what should be my hourly pay, including OT since I made tips.\n\nThis is totally legal under federal law. My company recently started using this loophole after a change in state law and it\u2019s had a noticeable effect on my checks. For the record, this impacts salaried managers too- their tips are deducted out of their salary pay. Granted, each state makes their own laws regarding tip credits so this might not exactly applicable across the board , but gives you an idea of the situation. \n\nLast time I checked, the only states that don\u2019t allow tip credits are NY & CA. The minimum wage in those states are around $15, so employers are required to pay you that + tips. Working in CA was the first time I ever got real checks serving or bartending. I liked this because it forced employers to respect you and your time as a side effect- in TX they have no problem with over staffing a shift and making people wait around while making no money and regularly having staff stay until 4-6 a.m. cleaning- because they\u2019re only paying you $2.14. In CA, at least where I worked they diligently made cuts to manage their labor costs and got people out of the door at the end of a shift. Staff wasn\u2019t responsible for deep cleaning. \n\nI agree with you that raising federal minimum wage and abolishing tipped minimum wage needs to happen, but as it stands with states being able to establish their own tip credit minimums, employers would still be able to undercut their tipped employees. \n\nObviously OP is NTA, but this whole tip credit situation is fucked and I feel for her friend.

I don\u2019t feel bad because I know exactly how much they make up here.", "Not at all. But that is a different problem, and tipping isn\u2019t helping. Should every min wage worker just be tipped then? Grocery clerks? Retail employees? When does it end if we are justifying it based on minimum wage. \n\nThe actual minimum wage has to change so it is a living wage. \n\nTipping culture in Canada is actually awful.", "Op says they're in Canada.\n\nThey make at least minimum wage and get tips on top.", ">Not happy with your own pay, you fix it.\n\nOnly adults with functioning brains can do that. We're not dealing with that population here.", "Same for Vancouver", "I was using self check out at an airport market and the monitor asked if i wanted to tip.. Tip who?? I'm pretty sure I was doing the work lol. It's crazy.", "The Tip Economy....", "You in Oregon or NJ? Only two states where it still law. I'm in Oregon.", "Tbh I don't know what they're paid here, either. Maybe I should look into that.", "\\*nods\\*", "Huh, not seen that, yet. What really burned me was places where service was included but they still tried to get you to tip. Like, what part of included are you having trouble with?", "I guess it is good I do not go to SBs. I am not tipping for someone making me a cup of coffee. Tipping used to be for service above the minimum expected. Well, when I buy a cup of coffee the minimum, I expect is for them to make it. That is the minimum that the job requires.", "TBF, I worked at Starbucks for almost 9 years. Customers were always asking why we didn't do credit card tips and always commenting that they would be able to tip if we did take them.", "I completely agree, even worse is the fact that it\u2019s a trend now for Starbucks employees to take your \u201cpay it forward\u201d & put it in their tip jar. They say they deserve it more & the ppl in the drive-thru can afford the coffee they were going to pay for anyway. Not cool. That should be a fireable offense imo", "I am aware of this - lived there for 19 years until last summer!", "There is no issue with tips in Canada if you work in the restaurant industry. If you aren\u2019t making tips you aren\u2019t a good server.", "LMAO blaming the workers here", "I completely agree with you that pressuring the employers is what\u2019s needed, rather than pressuring customers. \n\nI think I\u2019m misunderstanding something, though. I don\u2019t understand how a tip strike pressures employers. They\u2019re not losing any money or business in that situation, are they?", "Right. Very easy to be house poor. Thank  you for proving my point.", "Thanks! I was curious and never worked in food service so I didn\u2019t know what servers make here.", "So. Waiters can\u2019t afford to live on their wage, people visiting the restaurants know about the tipping culture ans how little servers make and still choose to stiff the server?\n\nWith how liberal and socialism-oriented reddit is, I find myself really surprised at times by how much people loathe tipping servers. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because *they* aren\u2019t interested in helping the poor, they want *the rich* to help *them*.", "I'm in Canada as well and as far I know  there is a different min wage for tipped employees.", "My sib lives in the USA and whenever they come visit I've noticed they ask the wait staff if they will get their tip or if it goes to the employer.", "Idk, if you don't tip the machine maybe it loses your seat ;)!", "In Germany, from what I know, we don't have a fix charge, but it's normal to give at least a 10% tip for good service. Same here with minimum wage. Overall a business should manage the prices that way that it doesn't rely on tipping to get a living wage for the employees in my opinion.", "Or people can just \"pay it forward\" by tipping the barista they just asked to make several annoyingly modified drinks....", "The hope would be that if everyone stops tipping, the employees might finally revolt and demand reform.", "I\u2019m almost positive it\u2019s illegal clear across Canada for servers to make minimum wage. I know it is here in the Maritimes. And as I said most servers are making more than minimum wage. Now I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re rolling in money, but they already have that much starting out\u2026 so I don\u2019t feel like I need to make up for that. I\u2019m truly tipping for service, not to make up money. I hate that the US tipping craze seeps up here because so many people don\u2019t know that key difference.\n\nAnd I should add I **only** tip at sit down restaurants. I don\u2019t do it for take out (I never get delivery so I pick it up myself) or fast food or at cafes or anything like that.", "You\u2019re missing the point, I think. I don\u2019t tip grocery store workers or fast food workers. They make the same wage (often LESS than waiters where I live tbh). Minimum wage being enough or not enough go live on is a whole separate issue. I consider it to be tipping for service, not supplementing minimum wage.", "In one province.\n\nhttps://www.restaurantscanada.org/industry-news/minimum-wage-by-province/#:~:text=Effective%20as%20of%20May%201,Wage%20will%20rise%20to%20%2411.40.", "> I'm not some CV-coach\n\nGreat, then take your useless advice elsewhere and leave it to the professionals then :)", "Same in Ontario. It\u2019s gross. Last time we ate out tip prompts started at 18% after tax and went to 30% with no option to choose your tip.", "I think that it's different by province. Tipped workers have a lower minimum wage in Quebec than untipped. $12.20 per hour instead of $15.25.\n\nEdit: Those will be minimum as of May 2023.", "I see, I guess they got rid of it, good to know thanks.", "I don't mind tipping but I get irritated when I can't choose the tip. My husband and I went to dinner a few months ago and service was abhorrent but there was no option to tip less than 20%.", "And tip is supposed to be on the amount BEFORE the tax.", "Yup. I've worked a number of service jobs too, tho every single one of them (at the time) was one of the jobs where tipping wasn't expected. \n\nI used to love tipping too. But only when it was earned. \n\nNow it's this constant expectation everywhere you go. And I want no part of it.", "There's a local burger place I go to that adds a tip automatically for online orders for pick up. I usually don't mind because they also offer a bunch of reward points so I almost always get one of our burgers free, and the staff there have always been fantastic. Buuuuut, it does bother me sometimes that it's the default. \n\nI delivered pizza and waited tables for a long time, so I know the struggle, but they're not even taking my order, just cooking it. And they don't get a tipped wage, they get a regular wage and minimum here is $13 an hour.", "Totally agree...I also tip a couple bucks at the pizza place. But honestly, it feels ridiculous to me to tip two dollars when I came in, asked for four slices of pizza, and all they did was place them in the oven for a couple minutes and then put them in the box. I mean at some point, there's a baseline of \"that's the job\" that shouldn't need to be tipped.", "Info: and in that case of abhorrent service, is there not any option of not tipping at all? Where I'm from, you only tip for good service AND if you can afford it.", "Yes it is.", "There was not. It was a trendy restaurant in a high traffic area (near all the major concert venues) and we paid by debit card. My husband maybe could have gotten an employee to over it or gone and gotten cash  but we were already running late and the restaurant was slammed.\n\nTipping is standard in Canada but most places let you choose whether you do it and how much. The suggested tip thing is relatively new (post-Covid)."]}
