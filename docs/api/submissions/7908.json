It is not your job to ensure people are making a living wage unless you are their employer.", "NTA. It's unfortunate for her, but it's not anyone's responsibility to prop up a non-essntial industry like restaurants. Not only is the food more expensive, it's usually less healthy than what you could make at home, and they waste a lot of food.  \n\nSlight tangent: In the spring of 2020, Canadian potato farmers were advised to plant 15% less because there was so much less waste from restaurants being closed or doing less business.

Are you expected to dine out until you lose your home, or what? \n\nIf you want to help your friend, perhaps you could offer to help her find work in a more stable field, or perhaps you could hire her directly, for your own projects, etc. Waitpeople are generally some of the most focused, hardest working, most organized workers around.", "NTA.\nAnd tbh I would have asked her to leave.

Nah...you go home now, bye. \n\nIf her current job isn't paying sufficiently then she needs to start working towards finding one that does.", "NTA.

Had a buddy in  similar situation that worked at Texas roadhouse.  I tip when i go out to eat but even at 15%, inflation has just made the pricing unreasonable.  Just a $13 curry plate, $3 side of naan, and a $2 drink puts me at $22 for a single meal after tax and tip.  What used to be an everyday thing for people has become a special occasion and the industry is failing or refusing to adjust.  The places doing real well that cater to the average joe are the one's who have pared down their menus and have focused on substance over style.  A small diner in my town hasn't changed asethetically since the 70's except for when they replaced all the upholstery (soon after smoking was banned in businesses) and they havent had any issues staying open.  The food is simple, tasty, and reasonably priced.  \n\n\nSide note, I love how she was apparently able to complain with that home cooked meal in her mouth.
