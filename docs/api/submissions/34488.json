Yours wouldn't be my first non-traditional/LQBTQ/same sex marriage, so that is not an issue. But, you are unremittingly unkind to me at work and make it very difficult for me here. I wouldn't want my discomfort to affect your day. Please find another officiant.", "NTA.

Plus car service and nothing less than a king suite at the best hotel near the venue, if that doesn't stretch credulity too much.\n\nBut you have to be careful to make it an amount you'd really do it for, so don't undercut yourself.", "I was considering just telling him no, but he's one of those who starts rumors really easily. Stereotypical hanging by the break room and stirring up shit.", "This here is the way- ask the date and tell him you\u2019ll check your schedule.  Have plans out of town.\n\nI\u2019m normally for being direct but you have to consider office dynamics here for yourself.  \n\nWhatever you decide you\u2019re NTA- but consider repercussions you may face", "I also have to make sure the food is to my liking, or I won't be able to do anything. I can't help anyone if my blood sugar is too low or my blood pressure is too high. Oh well, I'll add it to my charges in case I need to buy suitable food for myself.", "Oh yeah! You must be invited to all food and cake tasting, and final approval on the menu.\n\nOh, also a cake of your choice for yourself.", "I don't know, I think more cake will go to my \"birthing hips\" may have to substitute it out for something healthier, something leafy green like money.", "Money is always delicious!"]}
