To start with my wife (32F) and I (32M) have joint finances and have since we got married 7 years ago. Everything goes into a joint account, bills are payed out of it and there are no restrictions on who spends what. Naturally we discuss big purchases but overall there is no distinction in where the money comes from. The household has income and expenditures but it's not tracked at an individual level. I know this isn't for everyone but it has worked well for us.\n\nAs for our jobs my wife has a really cool job at this little shop doing art experiences for kids. Think pottery painting, or other little crafts. She loves it, and the culture and set up are great. It doesn't pay very well but the other aspects make up for that to her. \nI work in a corporate job and have done very well and climbed the ladder quite a bit and make good money. The pay disparity is to the point where my income makes up 85+% of the household income. Now this is fine, this is the set up that we have agreed on. I have no more right to the money than my wife does, we both can spend equally and make 50/50 decisions on expenditures. my job isn't better or more deserving of respect than my wife's. I in NO way look down on my wife or her career. Money has never been an issue till now.\n\nWe have a 3 year old daughter and after a relative moved away we are needing to find a daycare for her to go to while we are at work. While we are looking at options we weren't particularly impressed with any of the choices near us. Then my wife threw out the idea \"I never thought we would be a household with a stay at home parent but maybe that's what makes the most sense\" I was pretty surprised by this as my wife loves her job and has never expressed any desire to be a stay at home parent. I said \"I'm surprised to hear you say that I didn't think you had any interest in being a stay at home mom\" she did not like that response. \n\nShe said \"what in the world makes you assume I would be the one staying home\". I said we'll mathematically we couldnt afford to lose my income or we wouldn't be able to afford the house or the other expenses. This upset her further and she began going off on me about me being sexist, looking down on her job, and generally being disrespectful. I tried to respond saying I don't think any less of her job but just mathematically it wouldn't work. She said my \"math was sexist bs\" and the conversation devolved from there. \n\nWe still haven't figured out a decision around daycare, and any attempt to bring it up sparks the same sort of response. Im in no way saying she has to be a SAHM, or that there is anything wrong with being a SAHN. But since she brought up the idea of a stay at home parent I dont think I was in the wrong to point out the financial reality of the situation. \n\nAita for suggesting she would have to be the one staying home?", "created_utc": 1692196702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15srop1/aita_for_using_sexist_math/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can pay you more or less for ANY other reason. Even dumb shit like \"he always has nice shoes\". The bar they have to clear is making it not obviously based on the protected classifications. Beyond that they don't have to be reasonable or provable.\n\nThirdly, all data suggests even after controlling for variables in job field, overtime, child raising, vacation taking, and anything else, there is still a small gap on average. On the order of like [ 0.93 : 1.0].\n\nWhat this likely means, is that most places pay genders mostly the same, but one of every handful of women are severely underpaid.", "I am not in America, and indeed different countries have different legislations, and a lot of the data where I am is protected, so you would have a hard time getting the information to start any legal case to sue a company for it.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry but I highly disagree that schooling is less important than trucking. But even if we went by that, society historically has determined which roles were \u201cmore important\u201d and those were traditionally men\u2019s roles e.g: nurses were usually female whilst doctors were mainly men. Assistants and secretaries were also predominantly female roles, whilst the majority of executives and CEO\u2019s who they work for were men etc.\n\nI think society is changing and heading towards a more balanced scenario, but I stand by my point that traditionally and historically different roles were assigned on a sexist view, and that reflect on the remuneration, which has a legacy to some of the pay issues we have today\n\nEdit: just to add an interesting link for the US bureau of labour reflecting a bit on this https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-databook/2021/home.htm", "Wtf is the revenue of a teacher?", "If its a private comoany yeah you can pay someone more simply because you like them. You just can't pay someone less because of who they are. That's completely fine. \n\nOne thing those studies fail to recognize is negotiations. Men are much more likely to ask uncomfortable questions or put themselves in uncomfortable positions. From glass door to LinkedIn to indeed, you will not be able to find an employment database that says otherwise. Men are over 2x as likely to decline a job offer and ask for more money. That plays a MASSIVE role in overall pay. \nI worked a job as an analyst where my salary was $40K. A coworker got hired after me with an identical resume (both right out of college). We're both young white men. He started at $50K. Why? Because he asked. He told them he wanted $50K and that's the only thing he would work for. They have it to him because it was in the pay range. I accepted $40K and that was that. \nNow if I were a girl the whole world would scream injustice and sexism. But in reality, one person asked for more money and the other didn't. \nThere's a billion factors that go into this. \nAt the end of the day, if you want to be right on this, find me a real world example of a job or company that is paying different salaries specifically because one employee has a dick.", "Again, I think you're completely missing the point. There is no group of people determining what is important or not important to a society. Idk where you live, maybe you're on a farm where you make all your own food and don't ever go to the store. Here in america, 98% of people rely on grocery stores for food. Without trucking, people would die. Within a week. It's not up for debate, millions would starve to death in america without trucking. Education on the other hand, can happen anywhere. You can learn by going down to the creek bed with someone who understands the biodiversity of it. You can learn by asking a carpenter how he does his craft. You do not necessarily need school for education. You need trucking to get goods across the country. Subjectively speaking, you may think that the principles of education are more important in the long run than the principles of shipping goods, but that does not change the fact that on a day to day basis, people are affected substantially more by trucking than they are by their local schools. That is why trucking is more important. There's no group of people deciding it. It's based on needs in a society. In a village where everyone lives on the same compound, and they grow all their own food and take care of themselves, to them education is much much more important. Not because someone decided it, but because it's based on their needs. We have the internet to educate everyone from everywhere in america. We don't have farms producing Strawberries in Michigan in the winter. Needs determine value. This is something that left minded people can not seem to understand. I don't value water because society deems it so. I value water because I die without it.", "In america, it is the tax revenue generated from property taxes from residents within the school district. In some states with school of choice, the parents get the money via a voucher and can use the money to go to any public school, private school, or homeschooling program that they want. In most states tho, regardless of where you send your kid to school, your property taxes go towards the local public school district. The more people and the higher the property values are, the more revenue a school will have. Take that number, back out the overhead and labor costs for non teachers, divide the result by the number of classrooms/teachers that you have, and you will have the rough estimated amount of revenue per teacher of a school district.", "Women are penalized more harshly for negotiating and asking uncomfortable questions.  Women are not seen as go-getters, but instead as pushy and demanding.\n\n\"Now if I were a girl\"\n\nIf you were over 18, then you wouldn't have been a \"girl\" in any case.  Seeing women as \"girls\" in professional settings is also an issue.  Women are so often just not taken as seriously.  You think that's not a factor, however small, in pay?", "So a few comments because I think so far this has been reasonably civil:\n\nPaying someone more \"because you like them\" is mathematically the same as paying someone else less because \"of who they are\". The difference in relative income is the discussion here. I hope we can agree on that.\n\nSecondarily, yes there are indeed a billion factors. Negotiations are one of them. But we are dicussing studies and wages on average. Comparing women who are engineers with men who are engineers, women who are journalists with men who are journalists, and so on. And on average across hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people this gap exists between the averages.\n\nAfter controlling for things like specialization choices, hours worked, maternity leave taken, and etc the gap shrinks. It shrinks to a small value, but it is still existent and currently unexplained by anything except gender differences.\n\nOne theoretical on how this can exist and still make sense with everything you've said:\n\nWould you agree that due to historical roles in the family structure there is likely to be slightly more dismissive behavior towards women as either necessary earners or equal employees?\n\nThese individuals who are dismissive of women are likely to be less receptive towards women negotiating for higher wages or raises. They may even view it as a negative trait.\n\nIf out of 20 women, 19 get the same raises and wages when they ask for it as men in equivalent positions, but 1 gets underpaid by 40%, then you'd come pretty close to the 93:100 rate that is currently observed.\n\nIt is a well established and verifiable fact that executive boards are often heavily male-biased. If even just 5% of these old CFOs abd CEOs have antiquated opinions on women, it still would be more than sufficient to cause these gaps.\n\n\nYour final ask, is an unfair one. As you yourself pointed out I cannot show you any conpany or position that verbally confirms a pay difference based exclusively on gender. But I counter with the simple reminder that people can justify with half truths and lies and do so all the time. They can say they paid a women less because they didn't get a \"sense of a quality work eithic\" when in reality it is because the hiring manager believes that NO women have a quality work ethic.\n\nI personally believe that while the cultural problems are institutional, the wage gap has been reduced to several bad apples in an otherwise okay, albeit inadequate barrel. The problem is the saying goes \"one bad apple spoils the bunch\". We can just agree to stop puting our apples in a barrel and start refrigerating them, so to speak.", "By your logic then professional athletes, influencers, interior and fashion designers, marketing managers etc are all a lot more indispensable for the US economy, seeing as those are careers that pay more than driving trucks.\n\nI\u2019m not questioning the importance of logistics and chains of delivery as being essential to society, I\u2019m saying that society (the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community), functions on basis that are very much still permeated by sexist values that pre-date us.\n\nI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a group of people today deciding that women should be paid less in a job, or not perform a job, what I am saying is that not long ago women didn\u2019t work at all- not because they didn\u2019t want to, but because it wasn\u2019t socially acceptable. Women only made 47% of the US labour market in the 50s. That\u2019s very recent in historical terms. And that\u2019s speaking in the US alone, where you very well identified as a leader in gender equality. That\u2019s not the reality for the whole world however", "I agree wholeheartedly with your first point.\n\nI am tentative on that second point.\n\nIt is possible that is completely true of some people. I know my day to day lexicon utilizes \"girl\" and \"woman\" interchangeably as I also use \"guy\" and \"man\". I'm much more likely in both cases to use the former as \"woman\" and \"man\" feel clinical compared to guy and girl.\n\nI will note though that \"boy\" I think does have a youthful connotations with it, and it is interesting that I don't associate \"girl\" as strongly with youth even though it is the equivalent term.", "Women are penalized more harshly for negotiation and asking uncomfortable questions??? Where in the hell did you get that from?\nGirls and boys are a pejorative. This is why we call our soldiers \"boys\" even tho they are adults. Also why we call college athletes \"boys\" when some of them are 22 years old 6'6\" and 300lbs", "I see where you are coming from, and ultimately I think we just see this from different perspectives. Yes there will always be the subjective variables such as \"male dominated boards\" that pay women less for not having a good work ethic. And the bottom line is, you'll never really be able to prove that one way or another. Does it happen? Absolutely. People favor being around people in the same culture and background, and that will always impact hiring and promotions. If you're in a predominantly white country, and most businesses you apply to are predominantly white, you're likely going to benefit because you are of the same ethnic and cultural background as the people of the company. These are all individual based things. While I agree they happen and are unfortunate, the fact of the matter is that there is nothing systemic about it. It's just the way things naturally play out given people's free will.", "Yes society deems athletes and musicians much more favorable than truck drivers. Because in america we live in the first world of first worlds where we have so many things taken care of for us, that we have the luxury to splurge on entertainment. That leads to a society where the starting QB for an nfl team is seen as a God in the city because of how much people love football. When people are afforded the luxury of focusing more on football than survival due to societal advances, they spend their money on it and bolster up the industry. The more interest, the more advertising.  In a 3rd world country, no one would care about them because people would be focused on surviving and not entertaining. It all goes back to society based on needs and wants. Needs and wants determine what is important and what is valuable. This is why needs and wants are different in each society. If society deems something important, you will be paid a lot for it. When you personally deem something important but society does not, you're going to scream injustice when it's just supply and demand. \n\nNot to get on another topic. Us schools are the best funded schools in the world per pupil. In the last 3 decades, test scores have only gotten lower along with graduation rates and success rates upon the ones who do graduate. I love the idea of education, but the way america has been doing it is completely wrong and backwards. They need to be restarted before the need more funding.", "I would beg to disagree using examples of other societies where the same professions I mentioned are better paid than essential ones that are much needed e.g: South America. Insane high salaries to celebrities, politicians and etc whilst essentials (be it truck drivers, teachers or nurses - as these are all under paid in Brazil for example) indicates that need is not the only factor setting wages.\n\nI genuinely do not have enough information to weight in on the American education system, its funding and quality. You can very well be correct on your assumption", "My answer was simplistic. I was projecting American values and laws onto other counties. That was wrong. The biggest problem in south American counties is corruption. There are not laws and societal norms set up for these things the way we have in america. We have corruption no doubt, but economically we still have a decently free market. That is what protects people and allows supply and demand flows to go throughout the economy to everyone. Corrupt countries put levies on the flow to revert it back to the rich. And I know this because it's happening in america right now and it's horrible. If money was allowed to be free, things would be different. I don't know enough about Brazil to specifically point to laws they do or don't have that could cause or speed up the problem. You seem like a very nice person. I think we come from different places and have different perspectives."]}
