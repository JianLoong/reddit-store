When your daughter came to her and expressed interest in being adopted by you, your wife should have had a discussion with you to get your view. I know she figured since you've always been her \"father\" that you would automatically have jumped at the chance and many would have. But your situation is quite different as you've always made sure Mark was acknowledged as her father. And for her to allow it to happen right then in front of Marks parents shows complete callousness on her part. \n\nWhile you should speak to your daughter and explain your reasoning, remember her feeling are also valid.", "Nah \n\nMay should have spoken to you about this. \n\nMy assumption is May and Alice want a legal guardian if something happens. \n\nYou\u2019re her Dad, but I also understand your position. \n\nWhat about being a legal guardian?

Then you adopt her because if Mark could he would slap you upside the head and tell you you're being an idjit. It's not about his memory. It's about showing her she is as important to you as he was and giving her proof, not just words. She can't reach out to him for comfort and you turned her away when she needed it most.

You are the only father she has ever known. You really, really owed her more than that.\n\nMay fucked up here, it's totally fine to talk adoption, but just to spring it on you like that is so fucking out of order.", "NAH. I think you are doing a great job of helping Alice to understand who her biological dad is (and how he'd be there for her still if he was still alive), but Alice sees you as her father figure. You're the one who's been there when she graduated kindergarten and has helped her with school projects, the dad who's been there for 1/4th of her life. If you adopted Alice, you would still be keeping Mark's memory alive. Alice could keep Mark's last name for example. \n\nFor Alice's point of view, it's not fair to her that Jenny is 100% acknowledged as your daughter and she's not. Alice is reaching out to you and saying \"hey, I want you to just sign some forms 'officially' making you my dad.\" \n\nSome things to consider: If something happened to May right now, is there a will in place making you official guardian of Alice? Adoption can make this much easier, but without adoption or will, Alice would be given to either Mark's parents, May's parents, or could end up in foster care. Another thing to consider: If/when Alice gets married, would you say you don't want to walk her down the aisle because that's tarnishing Mark's memory? You'd walk Jenny down the aisle, but what about Alice?", "This is a tough situation. I see both sides.\nNAH honestly \nThey shouldn\u2019t have sprung that on you at a party, and you shouldn\u2019t have shut it down the way that you did. I 100% understand WHY you feel the way you feel. But try to look at it as you honoring your friend even more by being the man and father be never had the opportunity to be. He will always be her father, but you\u2019ve been her DAD for her entire life. I say NAH because no one was intentionally trying to do anything wrong. It\u2019s just a complicated situation.

Think it over and make things right again.", "NAH.\n\nI don't know how it works in your country, but your daughter also might have some benefits and rights from being the child of a deceased military, if it happened while on duty.\n\nI know in my country she probably would have a death benefit while minor.", "YTA\n\n>She got upset and ran to her room.\n\nGee, I wonder why a kid might be crushed when the dude who has raised her says \"I love you, but not enough to want you to be my daughter\"", ">  Also we have never discussed this situation in the past. I thought we were in a place of understanding that I am her dad but Mark is/was her father.\n\nSince Mark's parents were there for the party, ask them if they knew and are okay with this. If they are okay, I think you should do it. Mark's name is going to be on the birth certificate forever. You are not erasing it.

Stop worrying about the feelings of a dead man and worry about how you just rejected your daughter over a memory.", "ESH Adoption does not change biology. She knows you aren't her biological father, and you aren't doing anything to erase Mark by using adoption to legally acknowledging everything you said to her.\n\nSomething like this should have been discussed first rather than it being a surprise for anyone, and to avoid any potential emotional damage to Alice.\n\nI am guessing Mary assumed you would be 100% on board knowing you Love Alice as your own.

I genuinely think the process  of adoption is flawed, and I am with you on this. I would recommend doing other ceremonial gestures that speak of her being socially adopted, but refrain from the legal process. As far as paperwork goes  putting her in will and getting legal guardianship are ways to show you legally are her family. The process of adoption strips her from her bio side of her family. It legally separates her from her grandparents and any other kin from that side. The connection could be needed/ helpful down the road. It superficially changes her birth certificate to state false information. Sometimes there are medical/insurance issues that come from being legally severed from kin. You can ceremoniously celebrate her being your daughter without stripping g her of family kin rights. It can be an additive process\u2026not a swap, where she loses something to gain something. The education around adoption is not very good, I would say NTA, but please come with a gesture that fills what she is seeking\u2026acknowledgment of being her family.", "NTA Your wife is an AH for putting you and Alice in this position. This should have been discussed beforehand. A lot. You need to talk to Alice and tell her about her father and what he meant to you and how much you love her.

It could, god forbid, happen again.", "NTA, and first of all, sorry for the loss of your friend.

What happened between you all, the way you've been there and cared for each other, maintained these close relationships honoring all parties, is truly commendable. I hate to have to single you out as the AH for anything as you're clearly a stand up guy. Where it slides into YTA territory is that you didn't take a moment to take a breath, remember that you're the adult and it's your daughter's birthday, thank her for the big important gift and give her a hug. You could have said \"Wow, I'm speechless. Lots to talk about here. I love you so much,\" and given your wife the nod to go into the kitchen etc. Your daughter will forever remember this birthday as one of rejection. \n\nShould your wife have told you? Yeah, absolutely. I'm guessing given the incredible track record of support and acceptance you have nurtured, she didn't for one minute consider it to be dishonoring Mark and so never imagined you would either. She also did it in front of Mark's parents, so unless I'm really misteading the situation this was a big deal but not a totally wild card unacceptable faux pas of family drama.

Explain to your wife that the situation came out of the blue for you and you hit a third rail that you didn't know was there. Get to family/couples therapy, now--there will be lasting backlash from this to rebuild trust with Alice.
