We won\u2019t speak for a day or so and then suddenly I get these long voice notes detailing the latest part of childhood trauma she\u2019s remembered, saying how I\u2019m the only person she can trust (she has a lot of friends) and that she can\u2019t wait to see me so she can just cry and tell me stuff. So now I feel like my main role in her life is to fix her problems.

Long phone calls, multiple voice messages via Messenger, etc, and it would be exhausting. Then, when I asked that she give me a heads-up for the long voice messages (just so i wouldn'tget hit by a wall of them), she ended up freaking out on me, and at that point I had had enough and basically went NC. So much dread suddenly was lifted, and I realized that the friendship was causing me anxiety. \n\nFocus on yourself, OP.", "NTA. Her mental health should not come at the expense of yours. If she is unable to accept that, then she is not really your friend.", "NTA. \nHave you tried talking about your feelings to her? \nIf she doesn\u2019t understand your feelings, then maybe she isn\u2019t truly a friend and she might be just using you cause it\u2019s simple to talk to.", "Hi OP, my sympathies, I have been in similar friendships & it is hard to break that pattern. You\u2019re right, she needs to see a professional, you are not equipped for the role she has cast you in? Can you talk to her - try gently at first & say that you love your friendship, but that it needs to be give & take? If you don\u2019t feel you can be honest, you might need to step back a bit, especially if you have your own stuff going on. NTA", "NTA. She needs a therapist, and this can be overwhelming for any person. Is she getting help?", "NTA. From one drainedbrain to another, have a e-hug.", "NTA. Prioritize your own mental health first", "NTA. You are not her therapist. I'd give her a list of numbers and tell her to get back to me after 5 sessions minimum to see if there was a friendship worth salvaging under all that crap.", "Friends take care of each other. But it seems extremely one-sided for her to overload you with her trauma, yet not even bother to ask you how you are doing. And this is not an isolated incident? That is emphatically not friendship. That is taking advantage of someone's kindness. \n\nNTA and if distance is the best way to protect yourself, do it.", "NTA. This isn't a healthy relationship and I hope you can back away from her. You are well justified in setting boundaries about this--it's not fair to you and it's not good for her either. You are not her therapist and by allowing her to continue using you as one, it reduces the likelihood of her getting help from someone who is actually trained to do so. You're not qualified to treat her trauma and placing that burden on you, and traumatizing YOU by dumping all this terrible information on you, is not what a real friend would do.\n\nSet the boundary and stick to it. It'll be hard and she'll likely accuse you of abandoning her in her time of need etc, but it really is what's best for her, and you too. \n\nedited cuz my cat walked over the keyboard and hit post before I was done, lol", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t a friendship, this is being used as a trauma dumpster.  You\u2019re not a dumpster, you\u2019re a human being.

When I asked for support ONCE she couldn't be there for me. Said she would then ditched me at the last minute. I also noticed lots of small little lies she had told. I often don't stand up for myself but decided I needed to and was very honest and up front with her about the way I felt.\n\nShe's so self centred she hasn't even noticed that we aren't friends any more. In a weird way it amuses me. \n\nI feel much better now I've ditched her though, my mental health is important.

You say she hasn't asked about your life, well, time to put that right. Dont wait for her to ask, leave her a few long voice notes and see how she responds. Call her a couple of times every day. Let her know you're going through some stuff.\n\nYou will soon get your answer as to what kind of friend she is to you. She will either put herself to one side to support you, or she'll ignore you and cut in with her issues. Or you might find she realises it's draining dealing with other people's stuff, and she'll go quiet. \n\nAnything other than the first scenario, and she's a bad friend.", "NTA - you're not a therapist and she desperately needs one. Unfortunately there's no way of telling her you cannot mentally handle it anymore without her likely going off - based on the information you've given. This sadly seems like a situation where you're going to end up having to cut ties with her indefinitely. Best of luck OP.", "> isn\u2019t it my job as her friend to deal with her shit for her?\n\nNTA. If your friendship begins to feel like a job, it's time to take a step back.", "NTA. This friendship sounds very one sided. And you are not her therapist! \n\nMaybe tell her, that you need space. And then think about the friendship and your roll in it. Du you like to be the therapist for her? Is the friendship working for you? Or do you just feel traped? If so, step down. You don't own her anything. Either tell her that you can still be her friend but not her therapist. Or you might have to let this friendship go for good", "I know someone like this, and as soon as I realized she was that kind of person, I made sure not to get *too* close with her. Because it's like we can't just have normal reciprocal conversations, joke around, have fun, normal friend stuff. It's tough because on one hand, you can empathize with what they've been through, while on the other--you can also see that they're getting in their own way. \n\nThere's a difference between being a good friend when they need someone, vs being a trash receptacle for aaallllll of their shit. Friendships are a two way street, and you can't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. First step from here though? I'd try putting down a gentle boundary or two and see how she reacts. Could be as simple as: \"Hey I care, but I'm also having a very busy week, would you like to get together on Saturday to talk?\" It gets you out of having to address the walls of text, plus it's reasonable and doesn't dismiss whatever she's going through, PLUS it designates a time to deal with it, instead of whenever it's convenient for her to drop a bomb on you. If she insists, you can just reiterate: \"Looking forward to seeing you on Saturday to hear all about this, dear. Hang in there.\" She can either acquiesce, knowing she can't dominate your time, or she can get upset, in which case she'll eventually see her own way out. \n\nAlso, if you're in the US, I know our mental health system is trash, but there are ways to at least *try* finding affordable care. The county would be a good place to start, as they'll likely have a list of providers that charge based on income. How hard has she actually tried to help herself? Because I think, at the end of the day, that's one of the more frustrating aspects with people like this. They've got a million excuses. There's nothing wrong with having mental health issues, but it's also one's own personal responsibility to address them.", "I have a friend like this except she hasn't been through so much in life she just chooses to only be miserable, I've been avoiding her for 3 weeks now and I only reply when I accidentally open her messages and then she does it again and again and again", "NTA. I was in a similar friendship years ago, and telling her how I felt proved to be less than useful. What did end up working  was to almost flatter/enable her in a weird way by responding very seriously, telling her that her feelings were absolutely valid, she had so much to overcome/so much to deal with etc and that I simply wasn't qualified to help her, that this was serious and required an actual professional. I felt horrible and manipulative long after, but it did get her to seek therapy and we are now LC as she has a new outlet and I don't reach out to her. Maybe this sort of approach would work for you?", "NTA. Sounds like it might be good to have a convo about you taking her traumatic experiences seriously and that she needs supportive guidance from a professional who can help her recover. If it's not affordable, maybe offer to help her look for resources for free or low income options. It can sometimes help to offer what you can do while asserting boundaries about what you cannot. If she balks or breaks down, I'd redirect the convo back to her suffering matters and needs/deserves qualified care. Maybe even send her some basic info on treatment methods like DBT or EMDR.\n\nThe sense you have that she gets angry with you for your responses concerns me, although it's not up to me to diagnose. Functionally, you've become a captive audience for her and you need to work out a strategy to break free from that dynamic that goes beyond dodging her.

A trained therapist wouldn't do this for a friend - you don't even have the knowledge and experience that they have to take this on. You're letting her pretend that she's facing her problems when she's really just finding new ways to be stuck in them. It's very hard to face old trauma and heal from it. She desperately needs someone with the skills and detachment to make sure she doesn't spend her life suffering from her past. Meanwhile, she's pushing another caring person away and into their own mental health crisis. You can alert other friends or family to check on her - if she has no other support, call a crisis line to discuss what to do and who might help make sure she's safe after you're gone. It sucks that this falls on you, and she has a hard time ahead of her, but you really can't do her healing for her, or help her put it off forever.", "Sorry you dealt with that, glad you\u2019re away from the situation now.

It\u2019s a weird one because for the first couple years of our friendship she didn\u2019t really do this, but I guess we weren\u2019t nearly as close so maybe she didn\u2019t trust me enough to. We do have our moments sometimes where we are just laughing our heads off talking about stupid stuff, but it\u2019s not so often anymore.

Fact is, the longer she waits, the longer that list gets. \n\nI was trying to frame this up against a couple of close friendships in my own life. I know all the terrible stuff they've been through, and likewise, but it's because we've shared bits over the years reciprocally, by being able to relate to each other. Sometimes one needs more than the other, but it goes both ways. And our struggles are not the focus of our relationship--just enjoying each other's company is. I think, if you no longer can simply enjoy someone's presence...and it mostly feels like work, then what's the purpose of spending time together? I've had friends like that too, and those aren't the ones who've been around for the long haul, you know? \n\nAnyways, I think you're 100% in the right to feel the need to address this.

Listened to her stories for YEARS, and there would always be some new drama - her health, a guy, her job, her dad, her brother. And then my oldest niece passed after being in a coma for weeks (we made the decision to switch off the machines). Even during that really tough and heartbreaking time, I was there for her because there was some drama with her dad again. Shortly after the funeral, I went on vacation for 2 weeks. While away, I found out that my dog had a tumor and needed surgery, so that was the first thing I organized when I came back. On the morning of, I walked him before we had to head to the vet. He was 12.5 years old at that time, first surgery and first anesthesia, so I had no idea if he would survive. I was a wreck. On that walk, I bumped into her, and instead of asking how I was doing, how my vacation was, or how my dog (who she claimed to love so very much) was, she immediately started complaining about some bs or other. I tried to change the subject, but she kept going. So I finally said, for the first time EVER, that I had my mind on other things right now.

Ultimately, I'm glad this happened. My life is better without her, and I'm pretty sure your life will be better without that friend too. I understand it's hard to let go, but you don't have to carry HER weight on YOUR shoulders. Be as nice to yourself as you have been to her all those years.

She needs to know that other people (non-professionals) don't have the capacity or training to carry her baggage. She will wear out every friend she puts in this role.

I\u2019ve tried to set boundaries with her so many times, and it has taken years of me constantly telling her for her to stop doing certain things but I can\u2019t afford to keep trying anymore", "He accepts your adoration as his due \ud83d\ude09", "And you shouldn't haven't to tell her anymore or keep trying.  You've tried to politely, sometimes you have to be brutally blunt.", "NTA- your friend is an emotional vampire. I had one of those friends and had to cut her out of my life completely (she was a toxic narcissist as well).", "NTA. Just because you care for someone doesn't mean it's healthy for you to have a relationship with them. She is literally draining all your energy and sucking out your soul. NOT HEALTHY. Tell her she needs to go to therapy and release her feelings and frustrations there, not to you, or you will have to cut the friendship for your OWN MENTAL HEALTH. Her mental health IS NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURS.", "NTA. You are not her support animal. You\u2019ve done this\u2014to now\u2014out of love; she does not love you in return. Walk. Your sanity is at stake.", "N T A I have a friend who is similar and in order to stay friends with her I ve had to set som major boundaries. Be honest with your friend about the effect all of this trauma dumping is having on you and how you feel that your relationship is too one sided. She may cry and be hurt, but let her know that thing need to change or she won't have you around to talk to at all\n For myself, I've been working with my own therapist to realize that my friends problems are not mine to solve and that it is perfectly ok to just listen to a friend vent and say, I'm sorry you're going through that. I've got to go make dinner now.", "Tell her you now charge an extremely high hourly rate for trauma dumping, paid up front. \nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou are on the cusp of learning a very important lesson about boundaries.", "She sounds like she is in terrible pain and can\u2019t internally regulate her feelings. This is a skill she will need to learn to maintain adult relationships. \n\nIf you think she would be able to hear it, it\u2019s perfectly fine to tell her that you love her and want to support her, but being her emotional sponge is beginning to adversely affect you, and you need to draw boundaries. \n\nIf you think that would damage your friendship, then there are other strategies you can implement to deflect the trauma dumping: \n\n- Proactively initiate activities / conversations that you enjoy. You became friends for a reason, so get back to doing and talking about the interests you share. If she can\u2019t participate in anything with you without turning it into a trauma-dumping session, then make sure to always include another friend who she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable spilling around. \n\n- When she\u2019s trauma dumping, mirror and validate her pain without engaging deeply (\u201cWow, that sucks\u201d \u201cThat must feel terrible, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d). Let her get pissed at you, and don\u2019t feel bad about it. If she explicitly says that she expects you to help: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t really know what to do about this situation \u2014 you should talk to a therapist.\u201d \n\n- Offer support that doesn\u2019t engage with her trauma. Invite her out for distractions instead of spiraling into endless dialogue with her.", "I have a friend that will occasionally trauma dump with me and I with her but that's not our every conversation. We support each other and are there for each other but we also just hang out and chill and have fun.\n\n  This sound like a very one sided friendship and you deserve better.  It might be worth to talk to your friend about how you feel and explain why you are distancing yourself but ultimately NTA, you have to take care of yourself becare you can take care of someone else.", "NTA you're not friends you're this girls therapist. She can't tell when you're upset or she doesn't care. Having a fucked up life isn't an excuse to be toxic to other people. \n\nAlso as you're not a trained professional you can never really give this girl what she needs. This girl needs therapy and you can't truly give her that. \n\nYou don't owe her anything, and there's no shame in looking out for yourself.", "NAH. You should tell her that you are overwhelmed. Sometimes people get into a mode with a friend and don't realize that they are overstepping boundaries because those boundaries haven't been clearly stated. Since you've been receptive to her messages, crying, and general trauma dumping, she needs you as a safe place.\n\nSo, you need to tell her that you can't do that anymore, or the circumstances under which you can. That might be, \"we can talk for a few minutes when I see you but I cant take any more voice calls\" or \"I'll text for a while but I will let you know when I am overwhelmed.\"\n\nTry to make the limits clear. If you can't do it AT ALL anymore that is okay too and you can say that as well. It might mean the end of your friendship. You might want to say \"I need to step away from our friendship for a while.\" \n\nBut you need to decide on and set your boundaries.", "God that sounds awful, I\u2019m so sorry. That\u2019s exactly what my friend does. There\u2019s some kinda of drama every SINGLE day, and when she gets into arguments with her other friends she gets me to write the texts. It got to the point where I said why am I writing your damn messages for you? And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re teenagers- we\u2019re grown bloody women. She acts like a child", "I will do, thank you", "Thank you, I do need to be reminded of that", "I will do that. I\u2019ve also mentioned this to my therapist and she\u2019s always saying to look after me because nobody else is!", "So tempted to", "Think I\u2019ve learnt the entire lesson today just from reading the comments here. Basically confirming what I deep down know but is hard to accept. Sure it\u2019ll click today haha", "Thank you, that\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019d love to hang out with her and my other friends but she randomly cut them all off years ago for no reason. I\u2019m always asking her why and she won\u2019t answer \ud83d\ude2c", "I have friendships like that too and they\u2019re great. We can both vent to each other but we also just hang out and have fun all the time- it\u2019s two sided. This friend on the other hand feels completely different", "I was friends with a couple who were having major relationship problems and came from super dysfunctional families. They were constantly coming to me to talk about their issues and it was causing me major anxiety to the point that I couldn\u2019t sleep. I started to dread my time with them.\n\nI finally had to tell them \u201cI want to be your friend, but I can\u2019t be your therapist anymore.\u201d It helped for a couple years but I ended up cutting them out when I was blindsided by my husband leaving me. They made it about themselves and the husband had the gall to defend my ex-husband when I told them about a particularly terrible thing he did to me right before he pulled the rug out from under me. Apparently he had done the exact same to his ex-wife before leaving her suddenly. It was then that I decided I was done.", "Start sending her invoices for therapy every time she does this and don\u2019t engage", "The next step for her is just really hard. Anyone would want to stay with something familiar and less drastic. It honestly sucks that it doesn't work that way, but she really does need to learn to handle this without you. Even so I'm sure your concern and faith in her have meant a lot. You've been a loyal friend.", "Never been constant for me but i get it yea can be overwhelming", "You definitely made the right call there. And I do dread the company now. Even when she messages me I almost feel automatically pissed off", "I\u2019d be interested to see how much money I could actually make from doing that", "Thank you, you\u2019re absolutely right. I dont know a single friendship of hers that hasn\u2019t been rocky/full of drama/constantly complained to me about, and I suppose I\u2019m the next one. We had big arguments before but it was years ago, but I suppose people don\u2019t change"]}
