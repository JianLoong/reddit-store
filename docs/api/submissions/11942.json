We won\u2019t speak for a day or so and then suddenly I get these long voice notes detailing the latest part of childhood trauma she\u2019s remembered, saying how I\u2019m the only person she can trust (she has a lot of friends) and that she can\u2019t wait to see me so she can just cry and tell me stuff. So now I feel like my main role in her life is to fix her problems. If I don\u2019t give her some long, emotional response full of amazing advice (and what advice to I give in response to trauma dumping?) then I feel her getting pissed off and she thinks I don\u2019t care. \n\nI care a lot and it\u2019s not that I want her to hide things from me, but she relies on me to try and fix all her problems. I have to tell her things for literal months/years until she actually listens then she just does it again. I\u2019ve told her she needs to see a therapist but she just uses me as her therapist and I genuinely feel like I don\u2019t have a choice- either I have to fix it or I\u2019m a massive asshole. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind if this was an occasional/two sided thing but it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve been through some horrible stuff in the last few weeks and she genuinely doesn\u2019t have a clue because she doesn\u2019t ask. But I can\u2019t hold myself and her up at the same time, it takes everything out of me and I have ended up avoiding hanging out with her.

Long phone calls, multiple voice messages via Messenger, etc, and it would be exhausting. Then, when I asked that she give me a heads-up for the long voice messages (just so i wouldn'tget hit by a wall of them), she ended up freaking out on me, and at that point I had had enough and basically went NC. So much dread suddenly was lifted, and I realized that the friendship was causing me anxiety. \n\nFocus on yourself, OP.", "NTA. Her mental health should not come at the expense of yours. If she is unable to accept that, then she is not really your friend.", "NTA. \nHave you tried talking about your feelings to her? \nIf she doesn\u2019t understand your feelings, then maybe she isn\u2019t truly a friend and she might be just using you cause it\u2019s simple to talk to.", "Hi OP, my sympathies, I have been in similar friendships & it is hard to break that pattern. You\u2019re right, she needs to see a professional, you are not equipped for the role she has cast you in? Can you talk to her - try gently at first & say that you love your friendship, but that it needs to be give & take? If you don\u2019t feel you can be honest, you might need to step back a bit, especially if you have your own stuff going on. NTA", "NTA. She needs a therapist, and this can be overwhelming for any person. Is she getting help?", "NTA. From one drainedbrain to another, have a e-hug.", "NTA. Prioritize your own mental health first", "NTA. You are not her therapist. I'd give her a list of numbers and tell her to get back to me after 5 sessions minimum to see if there was a friendship worth salvaging under all that crap.", "Friends take care of each other. But it seems extremely one-sided for her to overload you with her trauma, yet not even bother to ask you how you are doing. And this is not an isolated incident? That is emphatically not friendship. That is taking advantage of someone's kindness. \n\nNTA and if distance is the best way to protect yourself, do it.", "NTA. This isn't a healthy relationship and I hope you can back away from her. You are well justified in setting boundaries about this--it's not fair to you and it's not good for her either. You are not her therapist and by allowing her to continue using you as one, it reduces the likelihood of her getting help from someone who is actually trained to do so. You're not qualified to treat her trauma and placing that burden on you, and traumatizing YOU by dumping all this terrible information on you, is not what a real friend would do.\n\nSet the boundary and stick to it. It'll be hard and she'll likely accuse you of abandoning her in her time of need etc, but it really is what's best for her, and you too. \n\nedited cuz my cat walked over the keyboard and hit post before I was done, lol", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t a friendship, this is being used as a trauma dumpster.  You\u2019re not a dumpster, you\u2019re a human being.  If she won\u2019t treat you like a friend, end the \u201cfriendship.\u201d", "NTA, and honestly, I'd say she's not really your friend.\n\nHowever, if you want someone to know what's going on with you, it helps to actually tell them, not just wait for them to ask.", "NTA, I've been in this situation and as much as I loved that friend I ended up losing them over it. The fade out is the way to go", "NTA.\n\nI recently ditched a \"friend\" because she was doing this to me.\n\nI was always there for her, hours on the phone calming her down, driving here there and everywhere when she needed it, giving support and sympathy over text as well. When I asked for support ONCE she couldn't be there for me. Said she would then ditched me at the last minute. I also noticed lots of small little lies she had told. I often don't stand up for myself but decided I needed to and was very honest and up front with her about the way I felt.\n\nShe's so self centred she hasn't even noticed that we aren't friends any more. In a weird way it amuses me. \n\nI feel much better now I've ditched her though, my mental health is important. Just because someone else is struggling doesn't mean I need to drag myself down to lift them up.", "NTA. This 'friendship' is a one way ticket. You say she hasn't asked about your life, well, time to put that right. Dont wait for her to ask, leave her a few long voice notes and see how she responds. Call her a couple of times every day. Let her know you're going through some stuff.\n\nYou will soon get your answer as to what kind of friend she is to you. She will either put herself to one side to support you, or she'll ignore you and cut in with her issues. Or you might find she realises it's draining dealing with other people's stuff, and she'll go quiet. \n\nAnything other than the first scenario, and she's a bad friend.", "NTA - you're not a therapist and she desperately needs one. Unfortunately there's no way of telling her you cannot mentally handle it anymore without her likely going off - based on the information you've given. This sadly seems like a situation where you're going to end up having to cut ties with her indefinitely. Best of luck OP.", "> isn\u2019t it my job as her friend to deal with her shit for her?\n\nNTA. If your friendship begins to feel like a job, it's time to take a step back.", "NTA. This friendship sounds very one sided. And you are not her therapist! \n\nMaybe tell her, that you need space. And then think about the friendship and your roll in it. Du you like to be the therapist for her? Is the friendship working for you? Or do you just feel traped? If so, step down. You don't own her anything. Either tell her that you can still be her friend but not her therapist. Or you might have to let this friendship go for good", "I know someone like this, and as soon as I realized she was that kind of person, I made sure not to get *too* close with her. Because it's like we can't just have normal reciprocal conversations, joke around, have fun, normal friend stuff. It's tough because on one hand, you can empathize with what they've been through, while on the other--you can also see that they're getting in their own way. \n\nThere's a difference between being a good friend when they need someone, vs being a trash receptacle for aaallllll of their shit. Friendships are a two way street, and you can't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. First step from here though? I'd try putting down a gentle boundary or two and see how she reacts. Could be as simple as: \"Hey I care, but I'm also having a very busy week, would you like to get together on Saturday to talk?\" It gets you out of having to address the walls of text, plus it's reasonable and doesn't dismiss whatever she's going through, PLUS it designates a time to deal with it, instead of whenever it's convenient for her to drop a bomb on you. If she insists, you can just reiterate: \"Looking forward to seeing you on Saturday to hear all about this, dear. Hang in there.\" She can either acquiesce, knowing she can't dominate your time, or she can get upset, in which case she'll eventually see her own way out. \n\nAlso, if you're in the US, I know our mental health system is trash, but there are ways to at least *try* finding affordable care. The county would be a good place to start, as they'll likely have a list of providers that charge based on income. How hard has she actually tried to help herself? Because I think, at the end of the day, that's one of the more frustrating aspects with people like this. They've got a million excuses. There's nothing wrong with having mental health issues, but it's also one's own personal responsibility to address them.", "I have a friend like this except she hasn't been through so much in life she just chooses to only be miserable, I've been avoiding her for 3 weeks now and I only reply when I accidentally open her messages and then she does it again and again and again", "NTA. I was in a similar friendship years ago, and telling her how I felt proved to be less than useful. What did end up working  was to almost flatter/enable her in a weird way by responding very seriously, telling her that her feelings were absolutely valid, she had so much to overcome/so much to deal with etc and that I simply wasn't qualified to help her, that this was serious and required an actual professional. I felt horrible and manipulative long after, but it did get her to seek therapy and we are now LC as she has a new outlet and I don't reach out to her. Maybe this sort of approach would work for you?", "NTA. Sounds like it might be good to have a convo about you taking her traumatic experiences seriously and that she needs supportive guidance from a professional who can help her recover. If it's not affordable, maybe offer to help her look for resources for free or low income options. It can sometimes help to offer what you can do while asserting boundaries about what you cannot. If she balks or breaks down, I'd redirect the convo back to her suffering matters and needs/deserves qualified care. Maybe even send her some basic info on treatment methods like DBT or EMDR.\n\nThe sense you have that she gets angry with you for your responses concerns me, although it's not up to me to diagnose. Functionally, you've become a captive audience for her and you need to work out a strategy to break free from that dynamic that goes beyond dodging her.

A trained therapist wouldn't do this for a friend - you don't even have the knowledge and experience that they have to take this on. You're letting her pretend that she's facing her problems when she's really just finding new ways to be stuck in them. It's very hard to face old trauma and heal from it. She desperately needs someone with the skills and detachment to make sure she doesn't spend her life suffering from her past. Meanwhile, she's pushing another caring person away and into their own mental health crisis. You can alert other friends or family to check on her - if she has no other support, call a crisis line to discuss what to do and who might help make sure she's safe after you're gone. It sucks that this falls on you, and she has a hard time ahead of her, but you really can't do her healing for her, or help her put it off forever.", "Sorry you dealt with that, glad you\u2019re away from the situation now. That\u2019s exactly how I feel a lot of the time. It\u2019s hard because I love her and she is there for me in a situation where Im really on the edge but it just weighs me down daily and I can\u2019t really cope with it. Will definitely consider leaving it", "I have but probably not as explicitly as I should. I\u2019ve told her multiple times that I physically don\u2019t have any advice or know what to say but haven\u2019t really said how it\u2019s making me feel", "I\u2019ll definitely try and talk to her about it. She\u2019ll definitely push me away for it but I suppose whatever needs to happen will happen", "No, she\u2019s not.

I do get the feeling it\u2019s not going to work out", "You got me there", "100% agree, thank you. Have been casually talking to myself about it out loud and decided it\u2019s really not healthy. I\u2019m going to bring it up with her and if she thinks it\u2019s unreasonable then I\u2019ll have to cut her off I guess", "Completely get you there. It\u2019s a weird one because for the first couple years of our friendship she didn\u2019t really do this, but I guess we weren\u2019t nearly as close so maybe she didn\u2019t trust me enough to. We do have our moments sometimes where we are just laughing our heads off talking about stupid stuff, but it\u2019s not so often anymore. It just feels in between all the trauma stuff, and it\u2019s always in the back of my mind. \n\nI\u2019m definitely going to set some boundaries with this. I will wait now until the next dump, probably within the next day or two I\u2019d imagine, and then will say how I feel. \n\nAlso we\u2019re in the uk, she could access at least some help on the NHS for free. I know the NHS is really struggling right now and wait times are quite long but this has been going on for so long and she\u2019s never even spoken to a GP about it. She could access therapy but just hasn\u2019t- which is ironic because if I don\u2019t address one of my issues with a doctor immediately, she will nag me to do it. It almost feels like a dismissal.", "God that sounds exhausting", "Yes I think that\u2019s a good idea as I often feel the same- telling them how you feel does nothing. I will actually try this thank you", "She could access help on the NHS but she just hasn\u2019t, even though I\u2019ve recommended her to get help multiple times for YEARS. \n\nYeah it is concerning to be honest- the way she reacts. I spoke to my therapist about this and she thinks it\u2019s some kind of personality disorder- I\u2019m inclined to agree with the way she reacts to people. She is so quick to hate someone or cut them off because they try to set boundaries with her, and when I\u2019ve called her out on that she\u2019s not spoken to me for days. But yeah I feel like I can\u2019t win with her.", "Thank you so much! I hope you choose the outcome that best suits you. \n\nCutting out my friend sucked (we had known each a very long time), but in the end, it was the right choice.

Something I did was to inform a close friend of him before and ask him to be availible for that friend for the next few hours, if he needs something. Because I would not be able to and don't know how he will react (so he won'T hurt himself or so). It was a big relief so I wasn'T to worried about. And it really feels better after", "She should get on that waiting list ASAP then. But I suspect she probably uses that as an excuse to not try? Fact is, the longer she waits, the longer that list gets. \n\nI was trying to frame this up against a couple of close friendships in my own life. I know all the terrible stuff they've been through, and likewise, but it's because we've shared bits over the years reciprocally, by being able to relate to each other. Sometimes one needs more than the other, but it goes both ways. And our struggles are not the focus of our relationship--just enjoying each other's company is. I think, if you no longer can simply enjoy someone's presence...and it mostly feels like work, then what's the purpose of spending time together? I've had friends like that too, and those aren't the ones who've been around for the long haul, you know? \n\nAnyways, I think you're 100% in the right to feel the need to address this. The most you can control is yourself. Setting some boundaries, even kindly, might make everything go tits up, but honestly that's on her. I wish you (and her) the best.", "I get that same dread. I literally just avoid my phone half the time because of it", "Good idea, thank you!", "Thank you Gizmo for your cat wisdom, I shall take that as fact", "That\u2019s sweet of you to do. Being explicit here, the main reason I\u2019m still letting myself deal with this is because I feel like she will genuinely do something to herself without me. She\u2019s often saying she couldn\u2019t live without me which i suppose is quite manipulative now I think about it but I suppose it got to me", "Completely agree, thanks for your help. And that\u2019s the thing- I have multiple close friends who have been through so much I can\u2019t even describe, but it\u2019s a two way thing. They\u2019ll check in with me before venting and will make it clear they\u2019re not wanting to dump on me- and they get help from therapist too and recognise I am not there to just solve everything for them- and we both do this in a healthy way. And we also, most of the time, just have fun together rather than being each others therapist constantly. That\u2019s how it should feel to me"]}
