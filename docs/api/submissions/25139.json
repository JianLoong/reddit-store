He\u2019s cute, smart, and very successful. The only downside is that he\u2019s almost addicted to buying things that are on sale or have coupons despite being a VP at his company. I\u2019m not talking about sometimes or even most of the time, I would be alright with that. He never buys anything at full price. NEVER!\n\nHe plans his cooking around what\u2019s on sale that week at the grocery stores. All of his clothes were bought on sale or clearance, even his socks and boxers. Last week we were at my friend\u2019s house for dinner and she commented on his shirt. He proudly said he got it on clearance last year for $20. I was mortified. Lastly, we don\u2019t go to any restaurant unless he finds a coupon or they\u2019re running some kind of special.\n\nThings came to ahead last night when we went out to dinner. He had a digital coupon for buy one get one free. For some reason, the restaurant\u2019s computer didn\u2019t recognize the deal and the poor cashier couldn\u2019t make it work. We were holding up the crowded line because he refused to pay for both dinners. Finally the cashier called the manager but he was busy somewhere else in the restaurant. While we waited, the people behind us were getting annoyed. I was so embarrassed I left him standing in line by himself and went to the car.\n\nWe argued the entire drive home. We were supposed to go to the movies, because he got free tickets, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood so he dropped me off. We haven\u2019t texted today at all.\n\nWhen I talked to my friends at brunch, they didn\u2019t see a problem with it and I found it frustrating that they didn\u2019t understand how embarrassing it is. Am I TA or is this normal?", "created_utc": 1692576975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wrn7t/aita_for_being_embarrassed_with_my_cheapskate/", "score": 7015, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He ate there with the expectation that the coupon would be honored. Again, as long as he was patient and not rude to the cashier, he did nothing wrong. If the people standing behind were annoyed, they should get annoyed at restaurant management, not him.\n\nOverall, this sounds very much like a you problem, not a him problem. And calling him a \"cheapskate\"? You've been dating four months. I can't see this relationship lasting if you continue with that attitude.\n\nYTA.", "Omg, not a shirt on clearance!! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWhy didn't you just pay for the dinner if you were so worried about the line of annoyed folks?  YTA", "YTA\n\nStuff is expensive right now, especially with inflation\n\nHe's being money smart and frugal", "YTA \n\n\nI spent most of the post thinking N A H. But you're just really judgy of him. There's nothing embarrassing about mentioning a good deal on a shirt that someone complimented. \n\n\nIf the coupon was valid (ie: he wasn't trying to get them to honor an expired coupon or get something different), he is entitled to the deal they advertise. Maybe the cashier could have asked him to step aside and rung up other people while waiting for the manager, but this wasn't his fault, it was the restaurant. \n\n\nAlso, I missed the part where you were \"so embarrassed\" that you just paid the bill, instead of walking away.", "1. Are you ever digging into your own pockets to show him that you don\u2019t mind spending money on him?\n\n2. If his clothes are a big deal to you, have you ever bought him a nice shirt to show him that the quality or look is better?\n\n3. You\u2019re very proud that he is a VP, are you more proud of his job title than him?\n\n4. You ever think that sometimes people might have other things going on in their life that they need money for and might not want to share it with someone he\u2019s known for like 4 months?\n\n5. You ever think that maybe sometimes people are just incompatible?\n\nYou sound like YTA!", "YTA Your boyfriend is comfortable because he is thrifty. Why should anyone pay full price if they have the patience to wait for it to go on sale or use a coupon. I live in a upper middle class community and the busiest store in town is Marshall's.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m always amazed that people don\u2019t base their cooking on what is on sale at the grocery store or buy meat in bulk and freeze it.  It\u2019s at least 30% and perhaps 50% cheaper that way.  So certainly nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe restaurant one I find weird.  If you are going out to eat rather than cooking at home you are already blowing the food budget out of the water so just go where you get the most enjoyment.  But again if he wants to save money that\u2019s fine.  It shouldn\u2019t be embarrassing for someone to use the items the restaurant provides.\n\nI\u2019m with him on clothing as well.  Why would anyone ever pay retail for any clothing?  Especially men\u2019s where style changes much more slowly than women.\n\nSo I think you are over reacting by being embarrassed and therefore are the asshole in this situation.  Have you considered why you find being frugal embarrassing?", "INFO: Do you ever pick up the tab?", "NAH. You are just not compatible.", "YTA, do you ever pay for anything on these dates or do you leave it up to him to pay for everything?", "NAH. You guys are just incompatible. He's not wrong for wanting to save, you're not wrong for not wanting to hold up a gigantic line of people for a coupon. Just different life approaches. And you will drive each other nuts with this if you don't discuss and come up with a compromise. Maybe his clothes and groceries are free for all couponing, but occasionally dinners out can be full price.", "OP- can I ask - why do you want him to spend more money? Is it you  want to brag to your friends and family that he\u2019s a vp and spent all this money on his clothes or the dinner he took you to?", "YTA. I would love this trait in a partner. He also had the coupon. Nothing wrong with having the restaurant sort it out as long as he was polite.", "YTA. A rich man who spends money like a poor man stays rich. He\u2019s humble and that is a damn rare quality in a well to do person. Nothing wrong with enjoying that money too, and I certainly get the embarrassment at a restaurant but at the end of the day, you sound real mad about ALL his spending decisions and that makes you look like a giant asshole.", "YTA and since he's both successful & frugal, he'll be wealthy.....and you won't", "YTA-  your boyfriend is probably the Millionaire Next Door.  Why pay $100 for a shirt if you can save $80 and get the same shirt for $20.  He still goes shopping, movies and dinner but because he has a coupon you feel it\u2019s embarrassing.  Him with a bank account full of money from saving is better than a man dressed fully price but not a dollar to his name because he\u2019s spending it all trying to impress you.  You too are not compatible so move on and let a lucky girl have him.", "YTA - there\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting to waste money. Since you have a problem with that you two are incompatible. He\u2019s probably going to have an amazing retirement", "YTA\n\nLeave him but being embarrassed that he watches his money and insists on deals being honored.  A manager can easily override the system.  It took a long time because the store is understaffed and runs poorly.  I think you're just angry realizing your free ride isn't as free as it could be.  You are embarrassing.", "NAH\n\nI bet he grew up poor and is afraid of going back to that state.", "YTA. It's one thing if you don't want to be restricted by sales and coupons, but there's no good reason to be embarrassed by being fiscally responsible.", "If this is real, I think YTA \n\nTake care of the pennies and the rest will take care of itself. He\u2019s clearly financially smart. He\u2019s saving loads of money, how is that such a bad thing? I live in the UK and I try to save money where I can. Reduced items in the shop, stuff on sale, vouchers for meals out if we can find a good deal. I do all of that. I even buy my kids clothes second hand and stuff from charity shops  for a reduced price. \n\nAs long as he wasn\u2019t trying to get them to scan an out of date voucher, and it was actually valid, he had every right to hold up the line. It\u2019s not his fault it didn\u2019t scan. Everything is so expensive nowadays, saving money where you can is smart. The way you\u2019ve worded this post makes it sound like you\u2019re annoyed he isn\u2019t flashing the cash so you can show off.", "YTA - restaurants run these specials, then are frequently unprepared to honor them.  He did nothing wrong.\n\nYou\u2019re not right for being embarrassed by the restaurants failure - the restaurant should be embarrassed, not you.\n\nFact:  Most multi-millionaires are CHEAP! I know this from personal experience.  I know someone who will drive 20 mins out of her way to save .05 a gallon on gas.  $0.05 x 20 = $1.00. So to save $1, she will spend 40 minutes (20 there, 20 back).  Factor in the gas used, the saving is maybe $0.75!\n\nMy boss, will have me spend 20 minutes looking for the best price for a particular item online.  I always find one cheaper by maybe $5 or so, which is far less than what I earned in pay for the 20 minutes it took me to find it.\n\nThis is a near universal quirk in those that have a high net worth.\n\nThe answer is, they think differently, than most.  In the example of my boss - yeah, he is paying me for that 20 mins.  BUT - at the end of the week, Im a salaried employee who gets $xxx.  So, what did it cost him to have me spend that 20 minutes?  Nothing.\n\nThink about that\u2026.", "YTA. Everything is so expensive right now, inflation is out of control. This guy sounds like he's smart about money and you sound like a brat. If you don't like the way he PAYS FOR YOU, why don't you pay for dinner? What's wrong with buying a shirt for $20 on clearance? Are you that spoiled? There's nothing wrong with looking for deals and sales. Grow up, nobody cares. You have no reason to feel \"mortified\"", "You were \"so embarrassed\" you LEFT HIM ALONE IN THE RESTAURANT?? Wtf. I literally can't picture the interaction where you, to the person you're literally there with and who's paying for YOUR food, says \"gosh the way you choose to pay for my food for me, and the way you insist this valid coupon be made to work, makes me uncomfortable. Bring my free food to the car.\"$100 says you made him give you his keys to his car so you could go be a fucking infant about your stupid issue.I would have dumped you on the fucking spot and left you there. I hope he does, as soon as possible. YTA.", "Yta. Your boyfriend sounds awesome, I do the same thing while shopping. Finding good deals and couponing is so much fun. As long as the coupon is valid, the restaurant is at fault. Assuming he wasn't being rude to the people working, he's not being an ah on any level. You however sound very judgy.", "YTA, never once did you mention how you offered to pay for anything, if you\u2019re not bringing anything to the table don\u2019t judge and also if he\u2019s fine using coupons and such who the hell are you to judge?", "You're mortified because your BF got a compliment-worthy shirt for $20?

If bf wants to be thrifty with money good for him. If you were so concerned about the meal then you could have paid. \n\nMost people would be happy with a partner that was not paying full price when there was an option to pay less. It's not your right to get upset about this type of personality trait.\n\nIf it's going to be an ongoing issue for you then it is probably best that you break it off and move on.\n\nGood luck", "I do this... What's the problem? Doing this is one of the reasons my family and I can take 3-4 monthlong vacations; a rare thing for Americans", "YTA.

You don't sound compatible with each other, just break up with him.", "YTA. Wealthy people stay wealthy by being smart with their money. Coupons are not only valid for poor/average people- VP\u2019s can use them too! It\u2019s VERY common to base your weekly menu by what\u2019s on sale at the grocery store. That\u2019s usually what tastes better too! If you buy fruit when it\u2019s out of season, it\u2019s both expensive and tastes bad. There\u2019s literally nothing wrong with buying your clothes on sale or on clearance, your attitude towards it is what\u2019s bad. You seem very immature. Inflation is ridiculous these days. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t mind if his being frugal with his clothes and his food meant you get a designer handbag or something out of it. You need to grow up seriously. It\u2019s his money, he can spend it how he likes.", "NTA.  People are leaving comments like \"I didn't grow up rich, so I get this guy.\". I didn't grow up rich either (not even close), but I did grow up with a sense of pride.  My Dad was very clear that we were worth as much as anyone else and we do not accept hand-outs.  I understand that being aggressively cheap can be really damn embarrassing.\n\nI had a boyfriend like this for a while - would try to haggle with everyone and get a deal for everything and such, and it did annoy and embarrass me.  Getting a good deal is great and there's nothing wrong with it, but making every decision based on what is cheap *especially * when you don't need the money just makes it seem like you don't value the person you're spending it on or like you're impoverished and desperate.  When you're super vocal about it and doing things like bragging about it, arguing about coupons, and haggling, it seems like you're loudly advertising the fact that you're money-insecure, which is not a great look, IMO.  I once had that boyfriend leave me alone in a restaurant for an extended amount of time to go back to our hotel room and search for a coupon for that restaurant which he couldn't find and thought he had left behind.  He couldn't find it and then tried to talk the waitress into accepting it anyway while describing it.  The coupon was for like $2 off!  I was mortified.  I just wanted to pay and leave and it ended up leading  to a fight, so I totally get where you're coming from.  \n\nAnd before anyone makes any asinine assumptions; no, I am not a gold digger.  I make plenty of my own money, pay for every-other meal of everyone I've ever dated, and otherwise split expenses 50/50 down the middle.\n\nEDIT: Just FYI For all you binary thinkers out there, there is such a thing as moderate thinking left in this world.  Just because I think there's a line someone can cross which goes beyond being frugal and into being miserly doesn't mean I think someone should never use a coupon or wait for a holiday sale day or tell themselves \"no\"; geez!  One can take literally ANYTHING too far.  You can take eating healthy too far, you can take gift-giving too far, you can take any relatively positive thing too far.  Just because someone doesn't want to eat only unsalted homemade vegan raw diet meals, for example, doesn't mean they only eat fast food and hostess snack cakes.  There is such a thing as a middle ground.   Is this really such a foreign concept?  Likewise, just because I would find it cringe-worthy to haggle and fight stores on their coupon policies on a regular basis does not mean I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck, engaging in conspicuous consumption to impress people, and not saving for retirement.  And same for OP.", "He sounds smart to me. YTA. He will probably be able to retire early.", "Lol ya you\u2019re the asshole easy. He got a shirt for the $20 & you\u2019re embarrassed? Are you rich? you ride in a jet 24/7? if you was so embarrassed & worried about other people why not pay it yourself? Cuz at this point you don\u2019t even like free things or can be patient for it.

If you were so embarrassed, why didn\u2019t you just break up with him sooner? I clip digital coupons to get cash back shopping.

You should be glad he takes you out. If he really wanted to save money, he'd dump you. \n\nI was so stoked the other day because steak was on sale, pasta sides were on sale, and frozen veggies were on sale. We never eat out anymore, but I made a steak dinner for 5 with leftovers for steak tacos on another night for $25. I don't think my husband was mortified.", "YTA, why on earth would you be ashamed or embarrassed of someone making smart financial decisions and being cognizant of their spending? Sure in the dinner example he might should have given up and paid after the coupon didn\u2019t work immediately, but this is a pretty stupid thing to be judgmental toward your bf over. Like it would be 1000 times worse if he was a VP and living paycheck to paycheck due to poor spending habits. Don\u2019t choose to view a strength as a weakness.", "YTA\n\nHe's not a cheapskate, he's being smart with his money or he learned to control his spendings because of his upbringing.

What's wrong with not wanting to pay for two meals since you have a coupon? Why didn't you pay for both since you were so embarrassed that a line was formed?

He\u2019s cute, smart, and very successful. The only downside is that he\u2019s almost addicted to buying things that are on sale or have coupons despite being a VP at his company. I\u2019m not talking about sometimes or even most of the time, I would be alright with that. He never buys anything at full price. NEVER!\n\nHe plans his cooking around what\u2019s on sale that week at the grocery stores. All of his clothes were bought on sale or clearance, even his socks and boxers. Last week we were at my friend\u2019s house for dinner and she commented on his shirt. He proudly said he got it on clearance last year for $20. I was mortified. Lastly, we don\u2019t go to any restaurant unless he finds a coupon or they\u2019re running some kind of special.\n\nThings came to ahead last night when we went out to dinner. He had a digital coupon for buy one get one free. For some reason, the restaurant\u2019s computer didn\u2019t recognize the deal and the poor cashier couldn\u2019t make it work. We were holding up the crowded line because he refused to pay for both dinners. Finally the cashier called the manager but he was busy somewhere else in the restaurant. While we waited, the people behind us were getting annoyed. I was so embarrassed I left him standing in line by himself and went to the car.\n\nWe argued the entire drive home. We were supposed to go to the movies, because he got free tickets, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood so he dropped me off. We haven\u2019t texted today at all.\n\nWhen I talked to my friends at brunch, they didn\u2019t see a problem with it and I found it frustrating that they didn\u2019t understand how embarrassing it is.

Not sure about your BF. Was he poor growing up? How was he raised? Maybe he grew up with not much so he sees the value in a dollar. I think it's ok to be frugal to an extent everything is expensive now..but if he's obsessed then I dk. I guess at least he'll be well off, but as much as I enjoy a good deal and coupon I couldn't base every purchase or meal off sales. I would probably be embarrassed at the restaurant not because of the buy or get one just because the restaurant manager was slow and I hate confrontation.

Being frugal and using smart tricks to keep costs down certainly is smart. But it can be obsessive. For example I remember a time in my life where I tried to pay as little as possible for every single thing even though financially it didn't have to. However it was to such an extent that I wouldn't buy/eat/do things I wanted to do just because they weren't the cheapest option available. Like I'd see a cheap snack in the grocery store and crave it so bad. But would instead buy something a few cents cheaper just to save money.\n\nFor example let's say there was a plain and a flavoured hummus. The flavoured hummus looked amazing but was slightly more expensive. So I'd never buy it. And if I did I'd feel guilty about the 'wasted' few cents that the flavoured hummus cost extra.\n\nOr there'd be an aged or an unaged cheese. I LOVE aged cheese. But wouldn't buy/consume any for years because unaged was cheaper.\n\nBeing frugal and thrifty is great! But spending money on yourself isn't always money wasted. Even if it is just something like getting some name-brand snacks or soda once in a while or just going to your favourite restaurant even if you have a coupon for the place next door. You can try and be reasonable with your money and still live life to fullest by splurging on small 'unimportant' things that bring you joy.\n\nLike in all things there needs to be a balance. And being too obsessive can become extremely restrictive and mentally draining.\n\nPersonally what worked for me in this regard was set up a budget. Yes I could live off of 1 pound a day of food if I needed to. But I sat my budget at 4 originally so I could enjoy a greater variety of food, splurge on my favourites, etc. And my budget was still an amount I found reasonable. Which meant that even my 'splurges' didn't leave me guilt-ridden or in fear of 'wasting' money. Because every cent I spent wasn't money out of my savingsaccount, it was money that needed to be spent this month on food! It was NOT going into my savings either way. If I had any leftover at the end of the month it would just get added to my grocery budget for next month.\n\nThat being said OOP's concerns really don't seem to focus on the right thing. She isn't concerned about his well-being or whether his need to 'save' money by getting deals is constrictive in an emotional way and keeping him from enjoying himself. If she genuinely felt worried about his behaviour/habits and feels they are too restrictive she should have brought those things up to him. Not as her primary concern being social embarrassment but concern for his well-being. In this way he might have either been able to assuage her fears or they could have revised his spending habits together and come up with a compromise/gameplan that alleviates some of the pressure he may feel to get a 'deal' on everything he purchases.", "Split your comment down the middle and you\u2019ve got a deal! \nJokes aside, theres a limit to being too careless and theres a limit to being too frugal - Some people have different thresholds for each of them and finding that midpoint is the key, OP just seems like someone who doesn\u2019t like the latter, doesn\u2019t make her a gold digger!\nShe was just brought up differently.. as opposed to the boyfriend who spent his early years with parents who probably survived on a below average income.. in my opinion, they both are in each-others polar opposites.", "Creating a huge line for a coupon when you are VP of a company is is.
