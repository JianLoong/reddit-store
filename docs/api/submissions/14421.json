Surely the parents expect their daughter to be the host and not some stranger?", "100% dont allow this or you will regret", "Who even thinks that's okay? Just because she's not using her room, it doesn't give her the right to move any random stranger (which her parents are to you) in to there. You agreed to live with her, not with them. Of course you're not the NTA.", "NTA. For multiple reasons. I initially saw your post in a cat subreddit then stumbled across this too. I'm half-Chinese but never lived in China, but my mom grew up there. I also rent and have 2 cats. \n\nMy mom's family had a farm, along with cats and dogs and treated their animals really well. But she has told me it can be common in China and some other cultures (I also lived in the Middle East and witnessed a lot of animal cruelty) to have little respect for cats and I know you raised your concern that they're \"not animal people\" according to your housemate in another post. \n\nAlso fuck having to live with your house mates parents for two months while she won't even be there. Especially with a cultural and language barrier. It would be uncomfortable and awkward, which you shouldn't feel in your own home you pay rent for. This'll be complicated with communication issues. Whenever I've visited relatives in China or they've visited us here in Australia, it's expected the host to provide for them while they're here. I work as a nurse and am financially much better off than my relatives in China, but they insist on supplying or paying for everything and providing for me. I absolutely appreciate the generosity but if I try to refuse some things and want to look after or pay for myself, they get very offended. I especially feel bad since I don't host them when they come here as I don't live with my parents. I don't know what her parents would expect from you not being immediate family. \n\nI would suggest she arrange alternative accommodation, or stay there as well, shorten the time they spend there if she won't stay for more than the first few days or weeks and give them written instructions/rules on what's expected from them and you in terms with your house, pets, etc. \n\nAlso if you're lease says guests cannot stay for more than 7 days or no subleasing, you have some grounds to stand on. I think its disrespectful this was not asked and instead informed with such short notice.", "NTA\n\nA short visit is one thing, but a 2 month stay is another especially since she isn't planning on being there. \n\nSure she is paying rent. For HER.\n\nAlso I have heard from several people (not just me) who have said even if they get along with their roommate(s) that if they are gone for awhile, they enjoy having the place to themselves.", "This sounds like the riddle how to cross the river with a fox, chicken and bag of seed.\n\nOP must stay with roommate's boyfriend for 2 months. This is the only way.", "NTA but I\u2019d quite enjoy having a guest if they were going to cook and hang out. I think it might be fun, it\u2019s a nice thing to do to let them stay. By the law of visitors, you also should get to come and stay with them in China.\n\nGive it a go and if it\u2019s weird kick them out.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance you would get on well and also try some nice authentic food. What I\u2019d do is see if you get on first by phone, and set some ground rules. \n\nI think in reality, you\u2019re not going to see these people because they will feel awkward and scared of inconveniencing you.", "You WNBTA here because you're the one living there and to have complete strangers come and live with you for 2 months is just unreasonable to say the least. Say something soon so she knows how you feel.", "YWNBTA! However, YWBTA if you let this happen! You may not be able to get them to leave and whether you think you will or not, you sound like a polite person so you will end up changing your behavior to suit your roommates parents. Besides, you did not agree to be be roommates with her parents, you agreed to be roommates with your roommate. Having her parents to stay for 2 months would not be okay even if she was going to be there with them! I understand that you are young and do not want any animosity with your roommate but just say to her \"You know, I've been thinking about what you told me the other day about your parents coming for a visit and I need to let you know that I am not comfortable with them staying here when you are not going to be here with them. I am also very uncomfortable with having any guest here for longer than our lease allows because we could get asked to leave or the leasing company may just decide not to renew the lease because we violated the guest rule - that may be okay for you since you have your boyfriend to live with but I do not have that safety cushion and I cannot allow you to put me in such an insecure position. It could even affect my education if I have to look for a new place to live during the school year. Please make other arrangements for your parents. And thanks so much for understanding.\"", "NTA and inform the landlord if she doesn't back down.", "NTA. She can't move someone in for an extended stay that isn't on the lease. Review your lease. That is essentially subletting. Tell her that you will be speaking directly to your landlord and do so. That's not okay.", "NTA\nContact the landlord if she makes a fuss", "NTA. \n\nInform her that they won't be staying and if they try to you'll be forced to call the police and the landlord. \n\nIf they do manage to make it into the apartment and stay, go ahead and invite all your friends over and have a grand time. Let them get uncomfortable and leave, they can complain all they want but it isn't their place it's yours and you have every right to have your friends and family over. If they dont like it, they can leave because they weren't given permission to stay.", "NTA at all. You should tell her she cannot have people staying there when she is not there. You are not going to be living with strangers. If they come there you should require she is also there every single night they are there.", "I would give it a try, maybe it will be one of your best experiences. But  I would speak to your friend first and make it sure that if it does not work out after a certain time that they will be required to stay with her and her boyfriend.", "NTA she's uncomfortable hosting her own parents but expects you to? Absolutely ridiculous\n\nCheck your rental agreement, hopefully that can be used to prevent this.\n\nLong term I think you should try to save to move elsewhere if possible. I'm getting the feeling this could blow up way more than necessary\n\nGood luck OP", "You need to tell her no and bar them from entering if need be. It's unreasonable for anyone to expect to visit for 2 months. I wouldn't even accommodate my own family for that long.  Use the backbone the good Lord gave you!", "NTA\n\nEven the kitchen I could imagine the parents taking over.\n\nThen judging you because different diets.\n\nI could imagine the landlord not being happy at roommates moving in parents, if there is then problems you could be in situation where landlord blames you.\n\nAt the very least roommate should of discussed before inviting parents to be your new roommates,", "I'm not sure if you can do much. In the end half of the apartment his hers. But why can't the parents stay at the boyfriend's house and she and the boyfriend stay with you?\n\nNTA, ESH, NAH? I'm confused", "Bring up the legality *immediately*, because you could end up being evicted for it. \n\nI'm super introverted too, and I absolutely get it. But this is where you need to put your living situation and your right to the home that you are paying for over everything else. \n\nShe does not get to dictate who stays there, or put you in a position where you could be homeless- especially when there is a *perfectly good guestroom* at her boyfriend's place, but she just doesn't want to make him \"feel awkward\".\n\nTell her to make him feel awkward. They don't get to stay. And if she tries, call the landlord. Tell her that your roommate has unauthorized visitors to the apartment that she is trying to have stay for months, despite your refusal, as you are aware it is against the terms of your lease. \n\nTell her you don't want to go there, but you will if her behavior necessitates it. This is her choice. Stay strong, friend. \ud83e\udec2", "NTA Don't even beat around the bush, OP. Just tell the landlord.", "Never mind if something is damaged parents will be back in China.  With op on the hook.\n\nI would totally speak to landlord and let them sort it out."]}
