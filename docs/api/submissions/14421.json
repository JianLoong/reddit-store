Maybe, he is the one who does not want them to stay at his place.", "That's the answer, then.", "Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we could have gentle conversations that end in satisfactory compromises for everyone. And those conversations can and do happen all the time! But Op\u2019s roommate left that option behind already. I have been Op. And even in the best of relationships, I would end up wishing I had set a firm and reasonable boundary before all was said and done.\n\nA tenant occupies the converted garage behind my house. When she moved in, she left me a note inviting me to a get-to-know-you dinner and letting me know her work hours and her cat\u2019s name, etc. Then she asked to share my cable because \u201cit didn\u2019t make sense for her to get her own\u201d if I already had it. My first impulse was to agree just to be nice. I asked myself if it was really too much to ask? Then I decided that it was. What if she didn\u2019t pay her portion? Our internet is dodgy already. I work from home and can\u2019t have the WiFi playing up. She had already parked her car in the driveway after signing a lease that specifically excluded the driveway from her use. I wrote her back saying, \u201cThank you so much for the dinner invitation. It was very kind but I must decline. I prefer to keep a cordial distance with neighbors. Regarding the WiFi, please sign up on your own account to avoid issues with access and speed.\u201d  Turns out, I made the right decision. Her car was immediately booted for failure to pay parking tickets. Her friends kept ringing my doorbell al all hours because she kept forgetting to tell them she lived in the back. She actually wanted me to let them WALK THROUGH MY HOUSE to get to the back. Same with doordash and other deliveries. I had to do a lot of boundary setting with her and I\u2019m so glad I started with a hard line. We are fine now. I bring back her mail and packages when they arrive and we check in periodically if something weird happens in the neighborhood. We get along fine (except for her hoarding causing rats \ud83e\udd28).\n\nIt\u2019s so much easier to walk back a super firm boundary set in the beginning than to try to put one in place later. And you can do it in a really nice way."]}
