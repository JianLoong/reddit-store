That she needs to deal with her own parents. \n\nSomething else to note: Depending on where you're renting from, there should be a clause in the rental agreement that stipulates how long guests are allowed to stay for. A lot of the rentals I used to live at said that due to insurance laws, if anyone stays over 2 weeks, they have to be added to the lease. They might not actually be legally allowed to stay 2 months.
