I've heard that Chinese culture when it comes to family is very close knit. They're going to expect things from *you* because you live there. They're going to expect you to be the host due to their daughters absence. I would also make it crystal clear to your roommate that you are not the host and you will not be made to be either. That she needs to deal with her own parents. \n\nSomething else to note: Depending on where you're renting from, there should be a clause in the rental agreement that stipulates how long guests are allowed to stay for. A lot of the rentals I used to live at said that due to insurance laws, if anyone stays over 2 weeks, they have to be added to the lease. They might not actually be legally allowed to stay 2 months. Just wanted to throw that out there. But I don't think your reservations about her parents staying there, makes you an AH.

It\u2019s common courtesy to speak to your roommates about having guests stay for any period of time. \n\n\nIn a sharehouse arrangement, not checking for a one or two night stay can be forgiven, but 2 months is crossing a line, especially when she won\u2019t be there. She has essentially decided that you are going to be living with two strangers for two months without any consideration for the fact that it is your home too.

You did not sign up for them to be your roommates. You will be supporting the.. Your utility and water costs will increase. You will lose access to common areas. \n\nDoes your lease even allow that? Does the landlord know? Most leases limit the number of overnights for guests. At 2 months, they will not be guests. They will be tenants, with tenant rights.

I hadn\u2019t even thought about cultural differences in that respect. I just remembered - when my roommate first moved in, I would just quickly say hi when she would come home from work if i was in the living room, and if i was in my bedroom, i wouldn\u2019t necessarily come out just to say hi. on the other hand, she would be way more likely to poke her head in my room and let me know that she\u2019s home. we\u2019re very open with each other and i think generally very respectful about our differences, and we\u2019ve actually had a conversation about this, because I was worried I was coming across as rude, due to the differences in our behavior. she actually told me that in her culture, some of my less social behavior would be considered rude, but since she knew me, she knew it was just my introverted personality. \n\nshe\u2019s been her for a while and will say herself that she\u2019s very americanized. it wasn\u2019t until your comment that i thought about the cultural differences, and how that could bring up issues i haven\u2019t even thought of. so thank you for that.\n\nmy lease does say a guess can\u2019t stay for more than a week. since we\u2019re kind of friends, though, and i\u2019m hoping to maintain a decent relationship with her as a roommate and a friend, I\u2019d really like to ~try~ and avoid bringing up the legality and just connect with her on a human level about how this makes me kind\u2019ve uncomfortable. just not sure how to do that yet.", "She responded earlier that guests are not allowed to stay for more than one week. :-)", "Was wondering the same thing. This is very strange. When you agree to roommates and suddenly get parents.", "I think you\u2019re well within those rights to ask her how she plans to navigate this, & then talk about your plans. For example: \n- \u201chey, roommate, I know you\u2019ve mentioned your parents will be here for a while. Are you going to be here during the times you\u2019re not working? I don\u2019t feel like I can entertain them since I\u2019m going to be doing xyz.\u201d Or \n- \u201chave you talked with your parents about my need for solitude? I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m rude if I just say hi and duck back into my room. What conversation have you had with them about their stay?\u201d \n- I would even go so far as \u201cI know you\u2019re staying with your boyfriend right now, but what\u2019s the plan during your parents stay? Will they have a key? I know our lease doesn\u2019t allow long term guests, so I just want to be sure that I\u2019m not supposed to be escorting them or something, because I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that.\u201d \n\nI just wanted to add in the phrases in case that\u2019s helpful. I think asking, then following up with a \u201cI can x, but not y\u201d is always helpful as it shows your lines of compromise and not compromise. \n\nBest of luck to you. This situation is tough.

Loud music, walking around in my underwear, my friends dropping by at all hours - and I\u2019ll be honest, things are not always as clean as they could be.

This is not acceptable to spring on someone or give them no choice.", "Cultural differences go both ways. In the US it is generally not Ok for housemate to do what she wishes with parents. It turns out it's also not legal. As the old saying goes, when in Rome, do as the Romans do. The parents are visiting the US - US norms apply. US law for sure does.\n\nThis should be a very straightforward conversation. The legal angle is, in fact, the best one because it's so cut and dried. Oh, I am sorry but what you propose is not legal so it won't be possible.

You could also try to use this to your advantage to strengthen your argument.

Communicating exactly what makes you uncomfortable and try to navigate it that way, if you want to stay friends.\n\nIn addition, I would bring up that having it sprung on you and not discussed prior, when its you who is hosting them instead of the roommate, makes you feel a bit hurt.", "I would strongly second this. If she doesn't get it, I think it's ok to say \"Look, we have a lease. That lease has rules, and one of them is no guests for more than a week. I understand you want your parents to stay here, but I'm not prepared to be evicted because of them. This isn't going to work - I'm not going to lie to the landlord, and I'm not ok with breaking our lease\".  \n\n\nI can tell you flat out that in California, unless there's an exception clause in the lease (I know this because we have one\\*), two weeks is the ABSOLUTE max, because more than that and they can claim residency and have to be evicted. Landlords are damn strict about that here - and if you're in an apartment building, the chances of hiding this are probably about zero over two months.   \n\n\n\\*We're ex-pats, and we have a specific clause added to our lease that allows for our immediate family members (parents, siblings/siblings-in-law, niblings) to stay with us for longer than two weeks, provided our landlord is a) informed in advance in writing, and b) we provide start dates and end dates, and proof that they will be leaving (plane tickets) if requested. He did the first two times we had family here... then he just asked for the email with the dates and some warning. But that's VERY much an exception - we negotiated it when we signed the first lease."]}
