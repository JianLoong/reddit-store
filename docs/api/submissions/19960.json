Make up your mind. \n\nHe is 18, and you had no right to remove something he purchased from his space just because you self admittedly can\u2019t establish boundaries and provide discipline to a SPECIAL NEEDS TEENAGER who arguably needs guidance and structure more than anybody.\n\nGood luck with the situation you created.", "YTA\n\n\nHonestly, this sounds horrible. \"I'm bad at punishments, so I wait and then do something out of no where\" is lazy parenting. \n\n\nYes, he is an adult but a an 18 year old who never learned to cook- thats on the parents too.", "YTA, he is an adult now.

He's addicted and its hurting his life and people around him (you). He might need some counselling actually. Why doesn't he care about finding a job or going to school, probably a reason for that. I mean if he can't talk to you about it maybe a professional will be the way for him. \n\nBut I think it's reasonable that you start learning him how life work. No job = no home, food, services. Start by telling him that he can either move out and figure it out on his own or find a job and start contributing to the household. I guess you even cook him food? Start by saying that he has to plan and cook 2-3 meals a week for the both of you.

Guess what, I did it, I have an apartment, a happy 12 year relationship, a clean home, a job that works for me (not a regular 40 hour a week job, but something that works for my autism and other disabilities) \n\nHe can absolutely be an adult. You preempting the obvious comments of \"kick him out\" won't stop me from saying, he's an adult kick him out. \n\nYou aren't helping him in any way by convincing yourself that he's incapable. He's capable. \n\nIf he can spend 40 hours a week on the computer he can spend 40 hours a week being an adult.\n\n\nEdit to add: YTA for taking away the computer, YTA moreso for assuming that your adult son is incapable of taking care of himself because of autism and ADHD.", "ESH.\n\nYour son sucks for refusing to go to school or following an education. He is also an asshole for not having a job until then or to at least alleviate some of the financial burden in the household.

You nurtured it. You turned a blind eye to it too many times in the past, which is the only reason why he thinks his behavior is acceptable now. You fostered an environment for his behavior to thrive and become more complicated and overwhelming. And only when it started to impact you, only when you had enough did you decide you were ready to put your foot down and begin creating structure and disciplining him in the ways he has always needed, consistently as a child. You have to own that.\n\n\nKids don\u2019t suddenly start acting up. There\u2019s usually a build up and patterns. \n\nWhat about your son\u2019s future? Why didn\u2019t you think of this before now?

You said his behaviour had been like this for a while, so if you suddenly have an outburst, and take his computer away, he's going to be confused. And he's not a kid that you have to confiscate his toy, taking the computer away wasn't the right choice. \n\nAlso, like you said, he's an adult and I agree it'd be unfair to kick him out without allowing him a chance to get his life on track. So, you should be helping him do that without confiscating his computer. Help him learn to cook, find a job, build up a social life (but seems he already has one if he has friends). That's your job as the mom. And next time, communicate before resorting to extremes and confusing him.", "NTA, gaming all day is very harmful for him.

Taking away his gaming PC temporarily might have been a decision driven by good intentions.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, considering his ADHD, autism, and limited social and life skills. I would suggest having an open conversation with him, expressing your concerns and listening to his perspective. Together, you can set clear expectations and establish a plan that encourages his personal growth and responsibility. Creating a supportive environment and exploring alternative strategies will be more effective than solely relying on punishment. \n\nWith love and understanding, you can guide him towards positive change and help him.\n\nYTA.", "He's going to go through withdrawal.

I noticed something about a lot of my peers, after they were diagnosed, their parents seemed to stop putting in the effort to teach them life skills. It's almost like the parents assumed that since they have a disability they will never actually live a normal life so they don't need to know these things. There were a couple kids who were more severe (sorry I don't know how else to put that), in the way that they were less verbal or non verbal, they used violence when words would work better, or they were just a little more prone to outbursts, who I could see being harder to work with and teach some of the more complicated life skills, but I still am confident that the majority of people with autism (even some of those \"severe\" kids) van absolutely learn to take care of themselves. \n\nI have one really vivid memory of being around 12 or 13 in group one time and we were all signing something and I was the only kid there who could write a \"signature\" (which was just my full name in cursive writing) every other kid wrote in blocky childlike writing, that was the first time I realized that there was something I was being taught that these kids weren't.

I'm not saying every person can go out on their own, but I sincerely believe that the vast majority of autistic people are capable, and too many are stunted by parents who give up or just under estimate their kids. \n\nThank you for your sincerity, and I'm happy to think that your kids have a mom who didn't give up and knew there was something (more she could do for her babies even when doctors were brushing it off) \n\nI had severe behavioral issues starting around five or six years old, and my parents honestly thought it was psychosis at first.

Added with ()\n\nEdit 2: I just brought this thread up to my friend, whom i mentioned above, and she said that dysgraphia is common for autistic people, so I guess I chose the worst possible example for my \"I was being taught life skills that they weren't\" example, that I possibly could have. I feel a little embarrassed, not gonna lie. Dysgraphia, as I just learned myself, is where people have trouble writing, their brain just doesn't make friends with their hand, and it makes writing a terribly hard thing to do. I'm a dick. But also, I learned something today. \n\nI think the example where my friend was fully capable of doing her own laundry but didn't do it because nobody ever taught her until I did is a better example.", "YTA.
