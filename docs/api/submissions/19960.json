If so, what does the therapist say?", "ESH, he needs intervention for his gaming addiction. THere are some places that retrain people for normal life. He needs help and need to learn his every day skills.", "YTA. \n\nSo does he spend the entire day on the computer or does he also go to the gym and hang out with friends?\n\nDoes he have little social skills or does he regularly hang out with friends? Make up your mind. \n\nHe is 18, and you had no right to remove something he purchased from his space just because you self admittedly can\u2019t establish boundaries and provide discipline to a SPECIAL NEEDS TEENAGER who arguably needs guidance and structure more than anybody.\n\nGood luck with the situation you created.", "YTA\n\n\nHonestly, this sounds horrible. \"I'm bad at punishments, so I wait and then do something out of no where\" is lazy parenting. \n\n\nYes, he is an adult but a an 18 year old who never learned to cook- thats on the parents too.", "YTA, he is an adult now. You can't take his property that you admit yourself that he paid for.   \n\n\nGranted he has ADHD and Autism, if it's hindering his ability to function that much is there outside financial help for him?", "YTA - you stole his computer, he bought it himself as you noted.\n\nYou could have cut off internet access instead only allowing it back when he gets started on looking for jobs.\n\nBut you DO. NOT. STEAL. THINGS.\n\nHe is your child, and you are stealing his things.\n\nIt is fine to deny him internet service if he doesn't pay for it or won't look for a job, but leave his stuff alone.\n\nYou claim you want to help him, yet you kick him when he is down...", "No, NTA. He's addicted and its hurting his life and people around him (you). He might need some counselling actually. Why doesn't he care about finding a job or going to school, probably a reason for that. I mean if he can't talk to you about it maybe a professional will be the way for him. \n\nBut I think it's reasonable that you start learning him how life work. No job = no home, food, services. Start by telling him that he can either move out and figure it out on his own or find a job and start contributing to the household. I guess you even cook him food? Start by saying that he has to plan and cook 2-3 meals a week for the both of you. Everyone should know how to feed themselves.", "I am autistic and I can 100% say that coddling him and acting like he cannot move out on his own is going to continue to cause issues. \n\nHe can absolutely cook and clean and do all the things he needs to do to take care of himself. You don't even need to teach him how to do those things, the internet can, I assume he knows how to use Google.\n\nI am 29, and when I moved out, at 20, had literally 0 social skills and very little ability to take care of myself. Guess what, I did it, I have an apartment, a happy 12 year relationship, a clean home, a job that works for me (not a regular 40 hour a week job, but something that works for my autism and other disabilities) \n\nHe can absolutely be an adult. You preempting the obvious comments of \"kick him out\" won't stop me from saying, he's an adult kick him out. \n\nYou aren't helping him in any way by convincing yourself that he's incapable. He's capable. \n\nIf he can spend 40 hours a week on the computer he can spend 40 hours a week being an adult.\n\n\nEdit to add: YTA for taking away the computer, YTA moreso for assuming that your adult son is incapable of taking care of himself because of autism and ADHD.", "ESH.\n\nYour son sucks for refusing to go to school or following an education. He is also an asshole for not having a job until then or to at least alleviate some of the financial burden in the household. He is mooching.\n\nYou are the asshole for treating him like a child and taking away HIS property that he PAID for HIMSELF.  \nThis is not how you treat an 18 year old young adult, this is how you treat a little kid.  \nEven if he behaves a bit like one, this is NOT the way to do things.  \nThe only way this could have possibly worked for a little was if you had said to him in advance \"If you don't do X or start Y I will take away your gaming PC\" and even that is on thin ice and asshole territory because it is his property and not yours.\n\nGive back what is his.  \nBut also communicate very clearly what you expect of him if he wants to continue living with you.  \nEither let him find a job and contribute financially, find an education and go back to school, or seek help in managing his autism.  \nAs some with autism myself it is not an excuse to do nothing.  \nOn top of that: Start teaching him basic household skills ASAP.  \nTeach him to do cook, get groceries, do laundry, etc.  \n\nHe has some serious growing up to do, but the way you approached this was very wrong.", "YTA this is not going to fix anything at all, you've probably made things much much worse. You need to work on yourself and figure out how to not let things build up, snap and do something big, drastic and frankly stupid. Also, it's not technically his pc, is literally his pc he bought it.", "I only read the first paragraph, and I\u2019m going to conclude that YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re the asshole because you created this problem. You nurtured it. You turned a blind eye to it too many times in the past, which is the only reason why he thinks his behavior is acceptable now. You fostered an environment for his behavior to thrive and become more complicated and overwhelming. And only when it started to impact you, only when you had enough did you decide you were ready to put your foot down and begin creating structure and disciplining him in the ways he has always needed, consistently as a child. You have to own that.\n\n\nKids don\u2019t suddenly start acting up. There\u2019s usually a build up and patterns. \n\nWhat about your son\u2019s future? Why didn\u2019t you think of this before now? That was your responsibility as his parent.\n\nMaybe if you had done the hard things that you have been avoiding for so long, you would never have been in a position to need to blow up or violate your adult child\u2019s space and belongings. Not only are YTA, but you\u2019re coming across as a huge hypocrite because you have been irresponsible, which is the very thing you\u2019re trying to punish him for.", "YTA kinda, you probably could've handled this better. You said his behaviour had been like this for a while, so if you suddenly have an outburst, and take his computer away, he's going to be confused. And he's not a kid that you have to confiscate his toy, taking the computer away wasn't the right choice. \n\nAlso, like you said, he's an adult and I agree it'd be unfair to kick him out without allowing him a chance to get his life on track. So, you should be helping him do that without confiscating his computer. Help him learn to cook, find a job, build up a social life (but seems he already has one if he has friends). That's your job as the mom. And next time, communicate before resorting to extremes and confusing him.", "NTA, gaming all day is very harmful for him. Although you, as a parent, have left teaching him lifeskills rather late, it is still possible and will prepare him to manage in future.", "I understand your concerns about your son's lack of school attendance and excessive gaming. Taking away his gaming PC temporarily might have been a decision driven by good intentions.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, considering his ADHD, autism, and limited social and life skills. I would suggest having an open conversation with him, expressing your concerns and listening to his perspective. Together, you can set clear expectations and establish a plan that encourages his personal growth and responsibility. Creating a supportive environment and exploring alternative strategies will be more effective than solely relying on punishment. \n\nWith love and understanding, you can guide him towards positive change and help him.\n\nYTA.", "He's going to go through withdrawal. For him, this was both an addiction and his entire social life. ALL his friends are online; everyone he interacts with on a day-to-day basis. He has friends and social skills; they're just all online. You've now cut that off without warning. For him, this is the equivalent of putting him into isolation or solitary confinement. It's going to be ugly.", "YTA. What you did is straight up theft. You should return it, apologize, and hope he doesn\u2019t press charges.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't mention whether he pays rent, so you''re giving him a little leg up that many other people don't have.\n\nMy ruling is that taking his possessions isn't the correct solution here. Just be frank with him and say if he is going to be living with you, he has to work.

Quit treating him like he's helpless. let him grow. dude can prolly cook, you just don't ask him to. You don't ask him for any money, either. so he ain't gonna bother going out and making any.

I noticed something about a lot of my peers, after they were diagnosed, their parents seemed to stop putting in the effort to teach them life skills. It's almost like the parents assumed that since they have a disability they will never actually live a normal life so they don't need to know these things. There were a couple kids who were more severe (sorry I don't know how else to put that), in the way that they were less verbal or non verbal, they used violence when words would work better, or they were just a little more prone to outbursts, who I could see being harder to work with and teach some of the more complicated life skills, but I still am confident that the majority of people with autism (even some of those \"severe\" kids) van absolutely learn to take care of themselves. \n\nI have one really vivid memory of being around 12 or 13 in group one time and we were all signing something and I was the only kid there who could write a \"signature\" (which was just my full name in cursive writing) every other kid wrote in blocky childlike writing, that was the first time I realized that there was something I was being taught that these kids weren't. One of them is still a good friend of mine, she learned how to do her own laundry when we were 20 and she came to visit me at my apartment for a couple days.

Tell people they're doing illegal things, and then you get money.", "You are remarkably lucky to 1.  Be diagnosed young and 2. Have had many different therapies.  Sadly, for the majority, those therapies or diagnoses don't happen at such young ages or at all.   My 1 son was 16 when finally diagnosed. My other son finally got diagnosed this year, he's 28.  In their younger years I was brushed off as \"a nervous mother\".\n\nI'm sincerely happy you got the therapy and help you needed.  Just be aware,  lots don't, and autism can present differently in different people.", "Oh totally, I hope I'm safe in assuming though, that you as a parent did everything you could to prepare your kids, in whatever ways they were capable of learning, to go out in to the world for themselves. I'm not saying every person can go out on their own, but I sincerely believe that the vast majority of autistic people are capable, and too many are stunted by parents who give up or just under estimate their kids. \n\nThank you for your sincerity, and I'm happy to think that your kids have a mom who didn't give up and knew there was something (more she could do for her babies even when doctors were brushing it off) \n\nI had severe behavioral issues starting around five or six years old, and my parents honestly thought it was psychosis at first. I am very lucky to have got the psychiatrist that I did. She worked with me for around 3 years before she gave me and my parents the autism diagnosis, along with depression and anxiety, at 9 years old, I was the coolest 9 year old at school after that. \n\nOne of those statements is a lie, I've never been cool.\n\nEdit, somehow forgot half a sentence. Added with ()\n\nEdit 2: I just brought this thread up to my friend, whom i mentioned above, and she said that dysgraphia is common for autistic people, so I guess I chose the worst possible example for my \"I was being taught life skills that they weren't\" example, that I possibly could have. I feel a little embarrassed, not gonna lie. Dysgraphia, as I just learned myself, is where people have trouble writing, their brain just doesn't make friends with their hand, and it makes writing a terribly hard thing to do. I'm a dick. But also, I learned something today. \n\nI think the example where my friend was fully capable of doing her own laundry but didn't do it because nobody ever taught her until I did is a better example."]}
