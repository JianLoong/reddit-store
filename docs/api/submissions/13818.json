Rent was always on time, they didn't trashed the place down, they had a cordial relationship with neighbors, basically they had no issues. \n\nThey got pregnant and as there's nothing in the lease contract about not admitting babies it was okay, although I did spoke with them because as you can imagine the noise a baby makes might disturb their neighbors. They said they didn't planned to stay there when the baby was born. \n\nThings happened and they didn't moved out. Their baby was born like 3 months ago. In these last months I've had many complains from their neighbors because of the noise. I suggested they should make their room soundproof (the apartments already are somewhat soundproof for privacy reasons, but I suggested a extra layer to prevent the noise from bothering their immediate neighbors) they said they couldn't afford it.\n\nWell as this issue has not ceased, I decided to evict them. I handled the eviction card yesterday, obviously I gave them the 30 days notice, they don't have to move right away, but they need to leave. They were pretty upset and said it was unfair because they can't control when the baby cried (they say this because most of the complains were because the baby cried at night and prevented the neighbors from sleeping). I understand that, but I have to look for the comfort of everyone in the building, not just them. They called me an asshole. Am I really an asshole?\n\n\nEdit: I'm not in the US, this is legal were I live because there's not laws against \"family discrimination\".

Trying to study for your degree? Sorry, there's a child crying next door, better luck next year.\n\nOverall, I am going with NTA. OP is not in a position to play favourites, they have to do their job of keeping as many tenants as possible happy, which IMO does not make him an asshole. The new parents are angry about being evicted, understandably so, but they also chose not to take any action to prevent the noise from bothering their neighbours. If they can't afford some blankets or something to help dampen the noise, then why do they think they can afford a child? I'm not going to call someone an asshole for wanting to start a family, but at least make sure you're in a good spot in general before bringing a child into the world. They were in a small apartment, surrounded by students and other people who likely want nothing to do with children yet, but they chose to say \"fuck everyone else, our new family is more important\". It's not like childbirth or pregnancy is a surprise here, they had months to work things out. They made a promise and then broke it, forcing OP into this position where he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.

The walls may as well not even be there. They can hear EVERYTHING. They found this faux brick stuff. It's actually a really thick foam that sticks on the wall and is easy to remove.

No. So why is it his responsibility when it's their kid?", "He is in charge of maintaining it for normal wear and tear and normal use, a tenant choosing to introduce a very loud source of noise is not is problem.
