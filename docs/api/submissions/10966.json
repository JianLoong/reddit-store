I'm so sorry they treated you this way. \n\nMost of christianity and catholicism is based on Pagan, but then it splintered off to become It's own religion, just like most other belief systems. And to beat you with a spoon for telling the truth????? Hyocritical Christians strike again. \n\nIt honestly is super interesting to learn about different theological roots, and how they come to be, and where the roots' roots originated, and so on. It kinda unravels how humanity's view of the world changes overtime as we evolve, as does our beliefs to a degree. God gave us a brain, so why not use it?", "... did you respond on the wrong alt account or is this a bot?", "So brother may be out of the water but not \"out of the woods\" yet. As no one in your family seems to believe in the spirits of the river or that your brother's actions were disrespectful, he (and they) may have to learn the hard way.\n\nWhen bad luck/bad happenstance seems to follow your brother or other family members who were there, remind him of this incident. Just because they didn't believe or respect Aboriginal spirituality doesn't mean it isn't real and true -- just like they feel about Christianity.\n\nIf I were your brother, I'd be looking over my shoulder and *staying out of the water* unless I could somehow find an accepted way make amends.", "So that's even worse, disrespecting a sacred place", "He's made amends now. Since this was a while ago. Ironically now he's the only one of my siblings or parents that has respect for the culture now. I don't believe in spirits but weirdly a month later he nearly drowned in the ocean, then a few days later broke his leg.", "you're agreeing with them tho"]}
