Hyocritical Christians strike again. \n\nIt honestly is super interesting to learn about different theological roots, and how they come to be, and where the roots' roots originated, and so on. It kinda unravels how humanity's view of the world changes overtime as we evolve, as does our beliefs to a degree. God gave us a brain, so why not use it?", "... did you respond on the wrong alt account or is this a bot?", "So brother may be out of the water but not \"out of the woods\" yet. As no one in your family seems to believe in the spirits of the river or that your brother's actions were disrespectful, he (and they) may have to learn the hard way.\n\nWhen bad luck/bad happenstance seems to follow your brother or other family members who were there, remind him of this incident. Just because they didn't believe or respect Aboriginal spirituality doesn't mean it isn't real and true -- just like they feel about Christianity.\n\nIf I were your brother, I'd be looking over my shoulder and *staying out of the water* unless I could somehow find an accepted way make amends.", "So that's even worse, disrespecting a sacred place", "He's made amends now. Since this was a while ago. Ironically now he's the only one of my siblings or parents that has respect for the culture now. I don't believe in spirits but weirdly a month later he nearly drowned in the ocean, then a few days later broke his leg.", "you're agreeing with them tho", "NTA. Fellow Aboriginal Aussie with white family here! They have some \u2728unpleasant opinions\u2728 but still respect aboriginal land and sacred sites.\n\nIntolerance is taught.

I am sorry this happened.

Do you have to deal with the \"casual\" racism from your white family too? Like those stupid petrol jokes, goon jokes or even the way they describe someone who's Aboriginal. Everytime someone in my family talks about someone who's Aboriginal they always have to preface it with \"Aboriginal lady/man/girl/boy\" it's never just lady/man/girl/boy like it is when talking about a white person.", "OK, then I should be allowed to fuck with some holy water and desecrate a church. If you don't let me you're racist.", "So by your logic if I went into a church and performed some demonic ritual on the alter or went to a grave yard and danced on people's graves that's completely ok?", "Im sorry, Im mixed too and I STILL have to explain shit to my white mom\u2026but she is at least understanding these days as she has softened much of her resolve.  Other family members for the most part arent too bad but one is a scary person now since 2016\u2026a shame too because she used to be my hero.  Sigh\u2026oh well", "... I just saw your username and had the most adorable mental image.", "Do what you like with holy water. And there is a bit of a difference between a church and a stretch of countryside.", "Worth mentioning as well that being indigenous Australians this is doubly disrespectful as the colonial Australians/ English historical proclaimed a lot of sites and land sacred to them. To do an equivalent thing all these years later is a really bad look and it is/was a shame that at 16 they didn't have the perspective to see that.", "Surprisingly, despite being Australian my family has gotten worse since 2016 too. America's biggest Import is its brain rot.", "It has nothing to do with restricted access. They were told (multiple times) not to, and they were told the reasons why. \n\nIf someone is told not to drink the holy water in a church and they do anyway, is it suddenly not a dick move just because the church is open to the public??", "Nope. Both are sacred sights. The only difference is one is a building and one is apart of nature. If you want to swim in a river go to one of the 1000s of other rivers.", "Okay, he definitely should've asked if that's the case.", "The wooden spoon, or the belt snap!  Been there.  But if your brother didn't really understand (from your family opinions sounds like not) jumping in a river is normal for teenage boy being a teenage boy.   If he apologized understanding significance now let it go and continue  to educate those around you.", "Still amaze me that people don\u2019t know that!", "I suppose telling them the mesopotamian/indus valley roots of the middle eastern mythos (plural?) would not be a great idea. Joking aside I have gone LC with family members for much less. NTA", "Churches are private, at least in the US.  This river wasn\u2019t necessarily on private restricted use property.", "One was built for the purpose and the people who built it might reasonably have some say over what goes on in it. The other is the result of geology. If some people want to worship it, fine. If others don't, equally fine. They can take their chances with lighting bolts, plagues of frogs or whatever,\n\nFar too much of colonial history has involved one group forcing their beliefs on others.", "Wow .....she sounds lovely.../s", "Quite ironic you talk about colonial history when talking about a people's culture and beliefs that was nearly wiped out.\n\nGuess I'll just put up with it next time and let my parents catch a hefty fine and possibly some jail time.", "At least, he has the sense to realize his mistake.", "Well, it certainly sounds like he offended SOMEONE. Glad he learned his lesson though!", "It's good that there's one relative who's on your side.", "I don't think it's about strength. You seem pretty strong already, with how you handled the event in your post.\n\nChoosing to limit contact is a big, scary thing. It's understandable to hesitate at the prospect. But you should also look inward and really, with all honesty, assess all the toxicity you've been dealing with all this time. And then maybe take a step back from them. \n\nThey're your family by blood and law, but that doesn't mean that they view you or treat you as they should. Everyone deserves to have loved ones (and chosen family absolutely counts) around them that uplift and treasure them.\n\nIt sounds like you have that with your uncle. And that's great. Hopefully you have others that can be described that way, among other family or friends, but if not, you can find more in time.\n\nPutting effort into building a safe haven and support network among those you know and love is so important -- especially when you have such toxicity in those that should be doing that for you. You deserve to have that safety and comfort around you.\n\nStepping back from toxic people can be scary and there may be a period of grieving at the loss of them in your life, but you may find that you feel better in the end for doing it. I hope that whatever you choose to do, that you find fulfillment and happiness there.", "White Australian here - You are/were NTA. It blows my mind that people can show respect to traditional western religious sites like churches, cathedrals, etc. but it's so damn hard to show the same respect to the sacred sites of the First Nations Peoples. Where I grew up there's a mountain, and not only is it a sacred site, but it's a sacred men's site. It's also well known in the area as a popular mountain to climb to watch the sunrise. The amount of people that were up in arms about the area being restricted was ridiculous. There are plenty of other lookouts people could visit for the same or at least similar views, but no, they wanted the one that was embedded in the local Indigenous culture.\n\nIt's really not hard to be culturally aware and respectful and it's disgusting that your own family, including your mother, are giant racist assholes.", "NTA you were right in what you did if they show that they don\u2019t respect the rule they shouldn\u2019t be able to partake in the activity.  Sounds like they are racist and don\u2019t care about your culture sim sorry to hear this.", "NTA", "NTA.  If the brother was 2 or around that, I'd feel the OP overreacted.  But the brother was 16.  He knew what he was doing.  Mum, step dad, and siblings need to put the blame on the 16 year old.", "NTA if there's one thing I know about Australia, it's that they have a monstrosity of animals. And if there's ***two*** things I know about Australia, it's that they can be very racist to the Aboriginal people there (I'm sorry if I'm not supposed to say that specific term as just a black girl in the US). I can only imagine how much you have to endure because you're surrounded by people who don't understand you, and from the sound of it, refuse to understand.", "Oh no, they must be so disappointed that they... let's see here... *desecrated a religious site.* I feel *so* bad for them. NTA", "I get where you are coming from, but would have you been upset about it if nobody told you that it was a sacred site?  It's a river right?  If you feel it was truly dangerous than you did great. if you only did it because someone brain washed you into following a man made rule. then you're wrong.", "INFO: why is swimming in the river a bad thing? I get that if your faith or culture tells you not to and you want to abide by that, but why do you think it binds everybody else?", "YTA, for forcing your nonsensical ideology on others. Spirits don\u2019t exist, grow up.", "And it's so weird that buildings are sacred but nature is not. You think if there was a God he would prefer a natural sacred sight rather than a building, you know... the stuff he supposedly made.", "If he was 2 I would also understand lol.", "You're 1000% right. Saying Aboriginal is fine but I guess that's based on the person just never shorten it to the first 3 words lol. It's not likely but not impossible that there would be crocs in there and during certain seasons bull sharks will be in there. Australia is very racist and not just to indigenous people. Anyone, middle Eastern, Asian, or even a little tan is probably going to experience some form of racism.", "Not murdering people is also a man made rule. Respect the original custodians of the land and their sacred sights. If it is not known by someone that is fine as long as they apologise when they learn of it and don't do it again (even though there are signsaround the place so i doubt that). And how have I been brain washed? I don't believe in spirits and stuff but I still respect it as a sacred place. Just like I would show respect in a church even though I don't believe in god.", "It's the same as saying why can't i do what I want In a church just because I dint believe in god. Why should it apply to me when it's not a sacred place to me? Respect...... and also the law.", "Okay, see I knew about the first 3 letters thing, I've heard about that before (and it's a general rule that basically any ethnicity shortened may likely be a slur), I just wasn't sure about saying the whole word. Yeah, I really feel for you being there in a place that hates everybody with the smallest melanin in them. Now that I think about it, I did hear they're especially bad with racism over there. I hope you can manage it as best as you can.\n\nBull sharks and crocs...no thank you! I'm happy with my passive aggressive robins that make a nest on our porch light, and the mean crows that like our mulberry tree as animals in my climate.", "Somebody at one time decided that they owned that land. They made up the rules. Does anybody really ever own anything?  I do get what you're saying. But Murder is against the Law. A true law involves hurting someone. If I speed down the road at 100 mph. I didn't really break any law, because I didn't hurt anyone. However, I did break a policy law that some politician made. Policy laws are not true laws.\n\nIf someone throws trash in that river it could hurt the wildlife. That's a true law. But jumping into a river isn't going to hurt anyone. That's not a law. \n\nDriving a car without a license is against the law. But traveling alone in a vehicle without a license it not breaking any laws, because that's not hurting anyone. If there's no victims, then there's no law that has been broken. However, the police will try charging you for breaking policies. Then you'll pay the fine, or go to court.  People these days don't know the law. However, there's truly not many lawyers these days that know the law either.\n\nPersonally, all laws set aside. If your brother jumped into a river that was against the lands policy, rules, and that humiliated you. You were perfectly within your right to turn around and go home. Bravo to you if that happened. I'd be telling your parents that they shouldn't, and probably wouldn't allow themselves to be humiliated be any of their kids. If they would, then shame on them.  But that doesn't mean they should have the dictatorship to force you into feeling humiliation.", "I don't much care what the law says, because laws can be right or wrong. And this sub is about whether or not someone is an AH, not whether they broke a law.\n\nAs for the church analogy, I'd ask the same question over any particular action in a church too. I attend church only if I am going to a wedding or funeral. I refuse to pray or sing hymns because that's not my faith. If someone doesn't comport themselves in the \"right\" way, I'll tend to judge it on whether or not I think they're disrupting the lives of others, not on whether they're breaking the tenets of some faith they might not share.\n\n\"My religion forbids you\" is a null argument. \"The law forbids you\" is a practical consideration but not a moral one. So help me out here, how does swimming in the river disrupt someone else's life?", "I like to imagine a little dingo pup with a tiara, big eyes and gorgeous long eyelashes.", "Us indigenous people don't believe in owning land, we are just the custodians.

Much love to you. Peace..", "I'm glad he's learned, at least. I wonder if those experiences maybe freaked him out a bit and made him think twice about being respectful of indigenous beliefs!", "Ah, oxytocin, thank you. Wasn't that the one up for debate recently due to a recent experiment?", "Possibly. I think it's more that mum dumped him off with my grandfather and me for a few months one time because \"I just can deal\". My grandfather being the best man in the world took him in despite not being related to him. My grandfather is a very spiritual man and ingrained in the culture so I think he really learned from that and realised that our mum, his dad and our siblings are shitty people.", "What a great grandpa \ud83e\udd70 this makes me happy that you have some awesome relatives to balance out the not-so-awesome ones!", "Aww, that's really sweet. Your grandfather sounds lovely, this makes me miss my grandpa \u2764\ufe0f", "As an Australian, do you know that you have access to 10 free sessions with a therapist per year?

Unfortunately a lot of the good relatives live In a different state.", "I think they have upped it to 20 if you need the extra 10 after having the 10 but I already have a free therapist through NDIS so I'm good on that front. I do need to discuss this with them though since I've been focusing on a lot of other stuff in therapy, probably time to start on that now.", "NTA\nYou were in the right. You respected your culture and tradition and taught your brother a valuable lesson. Good luck.", "NTA, assuming you explained this rule before you left home.", "I don't know anything about aboriginal culture, so I'm not going to comment.\n\nI see you writing: \"Depending on what you do to them it can result in heft fines or jail time.\" and it's very vaguely worded. Is it actually illegal to go swim there or not? Just swimming.", "Ohhh if you hate passive aggressive birds you will hate Australian magpies. They are demon's in bird form. They will swoop and try taking your eyes and scalp with you.", "White Australians walk, breathe, work and live on stolen land. The least we can do is respect local tradition by not *actively* going against everything we\u2019ve been asked. NTA, never TA, always has and always will be Aboriginal land. And alongside that comes the need to respect the owners of that land. Your family sucks and I\u2019m sorry that you have to be related to them.", "Omg noo that's not even passive aggressive, that's ***active*** aggressive. Our robins just stare at you judgingly after you knock down their nest and then they gossip about you to the other birds. We know it's gossip because the tweets don't sound like normal bird talk.", "My cousin has an Indian ring neck like that. Sooooo passive aggressive. Give her a food she doesn't feel like she will just drop it on the ground and look you in the eyes. Sometimes she also gives you a side eye look and then chats to her partner like she's talking shit about you. \n\nI'm glad magpies are intelligent though, me and my dad rescued one that landed in our yard and couldn't fly. Brought her to a native wildlife vet that got her better then gave her back to us to release. Since then we have never been swooped by any magpies in the area and she occasionally comes to visit us and hang out.", "Aww, you earned her trust and the trust of her community. She probably told the other birds these people are good people and not to mess with you.", "YTA. Why did you bring them, just to put them in their place for once?", "NTA Whitefella here.

It\u2019s not cute or funny.", "NTA as an indigenous person myself (M\u0101ori) I completely understand why you packed everything up after your brother did what he did.

I turned the descriptor around on my mum once and said \"I met this white lady...\". Ironically my mum said \"what does her being white have to do with it. That woman has no self awareness.", "Omg no self awareness! I might start using white as a prefix too! My mum has a real problem with it as well. \n\nSadly I'm familiar with how casually bigoted Australia is. I'm also Australian and grew up in Bundjalung country (though I'm not Aboriginal) and the bullshit racism my mates faced even in the 2000's was so heartbreaking.
