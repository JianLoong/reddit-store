He was visibly upset throughout the day and it ruined our wedding.\n\nFirstly his family were late on the Friday (said theyd be there at 1 arrived at 5pm) they also forget the steamer the one thing I asked them not to forget.\n\nIn the morning of the wedding my MIL informs the groom (my partner) that the polaroid camera we were going to use is out of battery, an hour after she says she is setting of to drop it 10 mins down the road. At this point he is going to be late for first look pictures, so after she suggests he buy a new camera in town, he snaps at her to leave it and communicate better and sooner next time.\n\nI also have an encounter with my MIL in the morning when she pops round to pick up flowers. No comment of how am i feeling, make up looks nice etc. She just asks me to change the seating plan so his uncle can be on a different table. I inform her I can't deal with that right now as its the wedding day and to speak to her son. Probably a bit abruptly...\n\nWe arrive for our wedding super happy then as we sit up to sign the papers in the ceremony I clock her. So miserable not making any eye contact. She's a witness comes up scribbles a signature says \"congratulations\" In a huff sits down again. My mum is stood there shocked whilst she signs the other signature. No photos were had of this due to how quick she was to get it done.\n\nAfter the ceremony she sits sulking in the garden. My partner is visibly upset and doesn't know why she's upset, asks her if she's OK she says she's fine. \n\nThe meal was the most uncomfortable thing... she walks around the room until she has to sit down on the top table with us at the last minute. Makes comment about the food \"oh guess I'll be veggie as it won't be halal\" despite us making sure all the food was halal and saying in advance.. asking why she is sat next to the groom and not his dad. Not speaking to my parents, not smiling in any photos.\n\nShe leaves about 10pm after not dancing, barely chatting to guests.\n\nThe next day when we ask what an earth happened and why she made her son cry on his wedding day (he went off to the bathroom during the meal to cry cause he felt so sad). She claims we both shouted at her in the morning and we ruined her day. Lots of back and forth arguing and screaming from her part. She didnt understand what she did wrong said she didnt sulk and wasnt rude. I tolder her the behaviour was embarrassing. Eventually she briefly finally apologises a couple hours later for upsetting us.\n\nAITA for still not wanting to speak/see her again? I just can't forgive how she made us both feel. The fact all my friends clocked it and my family felt bad thinking they did something wrong. I just don't want to make it uncomfortable for my OH who has forgiven her.", "created_utc": 1696853954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173qdhj/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_mil_for_ruining_our/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was your big day, she should have been happy for you and suppressed negativity", "NTA, MIL sounds like a trainwreck of a human being, just destroying everything that her derailed self touches. Are everyone of your in laws like her? This sounds like the beginning of a nightmare. The odds of doing EVERY SINGLE THING wrong that you had specifically asked them to do right is just astronomically so low, this has to be deliberate.", "Honestly it seems harsh but I'm going with NTA.\n\nThis was a horrible thing for what should have been a very happy day. I'm sure you feel gutted that your new husband was crying on the happiest day of your lives.\n\nI'm getting married this week and my parents have also been actively trying to sabotage our happiness and it feels awful. The one thing I keep saying to myself is \"Okay this is shit to me. But would I allow them for a second to treat my  future children this way? Fuck no\".  I can't imagine I'll be having any sort of meaningful relationship with my parents going forward- as they'll never have an opportunity again to ruin well _anything_.\n\nI ask the same question to you and your husband- do you want her to have another opportunity to sabotage what should be exciting days in your relationship?", "There's nothing a narcissist likes better than to ruin a special day. It's their favourite thing.\n\nI'm sorry it ruined your day.\n\nPeople like your MIL thrive on chaos like this, it won't matter to her whether you forgive her or not, it won't make any difference to her behaviour now or in the future. That your husband has forgiven her for purposefully ruining your wedding day is seriously disappointing and doesn't fill me with hope for your future.\n\nThe very best thing both of you could do is to cut her off completely but I'm guessing you're some way off from that. In the meantime I suggest you both do some research on narcissistic  mothers  so you know what you're dealing with.\n\nBuckle up, you're in for a rough ride ahead.\n\nNTA", "If you are asking whether you should volunteer an \"I forgive you for your terrible, self-centered, childish, destructive behavior\" I would say, absolutely no, do not do that.  And, I would be surprised that someone like her, who is completely devoid of self-awareness, would actually ask that.\n\nAll that is required of you is civility.  You cannot lower yourself to her level, which is sub-human behavior.  But you are not required to be warm and fuzzy to her.  If she speaks to you, you respond with kindness.  Don't ignore her, but don't go out of your way necessarily to please her.\n\nWhy?  For your husband's sake.  A woman that would willingly make her own son cry on his wedding day has a tight hold on his emotional health, and it will take years to untangle that.  In the meantime, do not further burden your husband by contributing to that by having an all-out war with her, or passive-aggressive interactions that fuel further conflict.\n\nBest of luck.  Geographic distance, in the end, if your husband agrees, may be the best and most likely solution for success to the problem of a \"miserable MIL who lies to bestow misery\".", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your MIL is happiest when she is the center of attention, and if she isnt, she will do whatever she can to make sure everyone notices her in some way. (remember that old saying \"negative attention is better than none\")\n\nSince your husband has forgiven her, be prepared for future renditions of this kind of behavior (at your childs christening, at a first birthday party  -- you get the picture). \n\nBUT forwarned is for armed. Now that you know how she is, you can take steps to mitigate it. \n\nHow you do that is up to you, there are books and articles on it, and you now have time to research. It would be great if you could get your husband onboard with it, but since he's grown up with her being this way, it might be hard for him to actually see whats going on.\n\nRegardless, Im sorry she tried to ruin your wedding day!", "NTA\n\nShe chose you make you and your partner's big day a pity party for her, soaking in as  much attention as  she could.  She's probably a narcissist, but regardless, keeping minimal contact with her for a while would be good for your relationship.", "NTA.  This is your future, please prepare yourself for it."]}
