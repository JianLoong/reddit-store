It was your big day, she should have been happy for you and suppressed negativity", "NTA, MIL sounds like a trainwreck of a human being, just destroying everything that her derailed self touches. Are everyone of your in laws like her? This sounds like the beginning of a nightmare. The odds of doing EVERY SINGLE THING wrong that you had specifically asked them to do right is just astronomically so low, this has to be deliberate.", "Honestly it seems harsh but I'm going with NTA.\n\nThis was a horrible thing for what should have been a very happy day. I'm sure you feel gutted that your new husband was crying on the happiest day of your lives.\n\nI'm getting married this week and my parents have also been actively trying to sabotage our happiness and it feels awful. The one thing I keep saying to myself is \"Okay this is shit to me. But would I allow them for a second to treat my  future children this way? Fuck no\".  I can't imagine I'll be having any sort of meaningful relationship with my parents going forward- as they'll never have an opportunity again to ruin well _anything_.\n\nI ask the same question to you and your husband- do you want her to have another opportunity to sabotage what should be exciting days in your relationship?", "There's nothing a narcissist likes better than to ruin a special day. It's their favourite thing.\n\nI'm sorry it ruined your day.\n\nPeople like your MIL thrive on chaos like this, it won't matter to her whether you forgive her or not, it won't make any difference to her behaviour now or in the future. That your husband has forgiven her for purposefully ruining your wedding day is seriously disappointing and doesn't fill me with hope for your future.\n\nThe very best thing both of you could do is to cut her off completely but I'm guessing you're some way off from that. In the meantime I suggest you both do some research on narcissistic  mothers  so you know what you're dealing with.\n\nBuckle up, you're in for a rough ride ahead.\n\nNTA", "If you are asking whether you should volunteer an \"I forgive you for your terrible, self-centered, childish, destructive behavior\" I would say, absolutely no, do not do that.  And, I would be surprised that someone like her, who is completely devoid of self-awareness, would actually ask that.\n\nAll that is required of you is civility.  You cannot lower yourself to her level, which is sub-human behavior.  But you are not required to be warm and fuzzy to her.  If she speaks to you, you respond with kindness.  Don't ignore her, but don't go out of your way necessarily to please her.\n\nWhy?  For your husband's sake.  A woman that would willingly make her own son cry on his wedding day has a tight hold on his emotional health, and it will take years to untangle that.  In the meantime, do not further burden your husband by contributing to that by having an all-out war with her, or passive-aggressive interactions that fuel further conflict.\n\nBest of luck.  Geographic distance, in the end, if your husband agrees, may be the best and most likely solution for success to the problem of a \"miserable MIL who lies to bestow misery\".", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your MIL is happiest when she is the center of attention, and if she isnt, she will do whatever she can to make sure everyone notices her in some way. (remember that old saying \"negative attention is better than none\")\n\nSince your husband has forgiven her, be prepared for future renditions of this kind of behavior (at your childs christening, at a first birthday party  -- you get the picture). \n\nBUT forwarned is for armed. Now that you know how she is, you can take steps to mitigate it. \n\nHow you do that is up to you, there are books and articles on it, and you now have time to research. It would be great if you could get your husband onboard with it, but since he's grown up with her being this way, it might be hard for him to actually see whats going on.\n\nRegardless, Im sorry she tried to ruin your wedding day!", "NTA\n\nShe chose you make you and your partner's big day a pity party for her, soaking in as  much attention as  she could.  She's probably a narcissist, but regardless, keeping minimal contact with her for a while would be good for your relationship.", "NTA.  This is your future, please prepare yourself for it.", "NTA\n\nShe did this on purpose, she knew exactly what she was doing. Suprised she did'nt turn up in a white dres in an attempt to up stage you!\n\nYou need to cut her out completely. \n\nSorry she is not going to change and will do her best to make you miserable at every turn.", "NTA. Why and how would you need to forgive someone who isn\u2019t sorry? She fully intended on being like this, she just thinks she found an excuse or reason to do so,  but she would have found any little thing to disrupt your day.  Remind your husband of this day, frequently, as you will need to, when it comes to things and times you want to not include her, give her the attention, etc.  it will likely not only continue but get worse", "Your spouse has been trained since birth to kowtow to her bullshit. Don\u2019t give in.

I had a LONG list of clusterf**ks that happened on the lead up and actual wedding day. We are now almost 30 years married. Unapologetically cut out toxic.

I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that but at least now you know her true face.\n\nDid she smile in the pictures? My mother couldn\u2019t even do that (nothing to do with the bride or groom) and of course blamed me for the look on her face that ruined every single picture she was in. \n\nWhat she didn\u2019t count on was photoshop. She thought she won by making the pictures about her, and was horrified to see she was totally cut out of some and had her face altered in the only family photo we gave to our families. Except for hers. She got the piss-face one to hang on her wall and remind everyone what kind of person she is. When my sister got married years later, mom wasn\u2019t even invited.", "ESH.  You two have her way too much power and responsibility.  He shouldn\u2019t be crying over his mom being a pain.  She obviously has been for a long time and it isn\u2019t going to stop voluntarily.  The only way to stop it is reduce contact and never depend on her for anything.  You two need to act like adults where the only person\u2019s happiness on that day that should have mattered was you two.  Why would you have such a person bring stuff and pick up stuff?", "NTA - but you are stuck with her for life, I have and obnoxious MIL.  I get it!

Sounds like it could have been a great day if you focused on each other instead of her. Me thinks you like the drama", "YWBTA\n\nI'm sorry that you feel the day was ruined by her, but I urge you not to start out your marriage by exiling your MIL.  What she did was wrong.  Absolutely.  But to hold this grudge forever..?  I think with the passage of time you will come to remember the good times of your wedding over the set involving your MIL.  Do not start the next chapter of your life with this thorn in your heart.", "NTA.

Let her know you need time, it will also allow you to see how sincere her apology is.\nIt's perhaps some kind of unresolved \"reversed oedipus complex': she doesn't want to loose her son to another woman. You and your husband probably better keep her far away from your life.", "NTA. Absolutely don't allow this slide.

You and he should discuss how best to create that relationship, and your responses to it,  within what you both need to be together on all interactions.", "NTA. Definitely time to go no contact with your MIL.  She decided to muck up your wedding so you definitely do no need her in your life.", "NTA - this isn't a forgiveness issue,  this is a don't put up with bad behavior issue.  She did what she did,  you can't change it. What you can change is the interaction going forward and that means there won't be any.", "As an adult child of a narc, I can confirm that it is incredibly difficult to go NC. I can also confirm that going NC is also the best decision you can make - 26yrs and counting for me. \n\nIt is incredibly hard to go NC because they are your family who we are hardwired to love. You're groomed & conditioned to believe that this abuse = love, to carry the emotional load of the parent, to accept blame for all of the narc's abuse and to carry responsibility & guilt -  you are trauma bonded. \n\nNarc's are usually more discreet about their abuse choosing instead to do it on private and have a fake public face where they're all smiles. It is very telling that she couldn't even pretend to be happy on her son's wedding day. Yes the attention has to be all about the narc but I'm guessing she's more upset about the fact that she's losing her supply. Everyone can also now see how appalling & vile she is - there's no concealing that fact no matter how much she gaslights her son. \n\nTo OP and OP's husband, I would recommend the youtube channels of Dr Ramani and Patrick Teahan. Both offer knowledgeable & compassionate insights & advise on narc abuse, psychopathy and dynamics & how to manage narcs using techniques such as grey rocking & firewalling. Patrick also produces videos where he role plays the right & wrong way to communicate with the narc - this will be very helpful to husband. I would also recommend the book The Dance of Anger by Harriet Lerner which advises on how to manage difficult people and feel guilt free when you do this. Depending on how trauma bonded your husband is, he may need counselling too - look for counsellors who specialise in complex ptsd and emotional abuse.\n\nWhether you have children or not, this situation is something you both need to resolve. If you are planning on having children, resolve this beforehand as I guarantee she'll harass & interfere, make your child birth experience entirely about her and sulk if you choose a name she doesn't approve of. \n\nIf your husband decides not to go NC then remind her that it is her interest to do as she's told if she wants you to be her carer - narc's can always be relied upon to act in self interest so it may be a good way to keep her in check. Do not give her the keys to your house and have external cameras installed. Never underestimate a narc's capacity to screw with your life, rifle through your belongings, violate your boundaries etc\n\nWe all want to love our parents and believe the best about them so coming to terms with the fact that your parents are actually monsters is the worst pill to swallow. I'm glad he has you to support him through this, as you move forward with your lives together, as he will need this as he comes to terms with the awful realisation that his mum is an abusive monster and he is a victim of abuse.\n\nLastly, but most importantly, congratulations on your wedding. I hope that you & your husband have an amazing & wonderful future together. Sincerely wishing you both all the very best.", "NTA\n\nShe is a narcissist and I suggest you go NC until you have a firm grasp on what that means. These people are unreal and you NEED to be equipped to handle them.", "cut her off for mental health reasons. NTA", "Oh, I feel you on this one... my MIL tried her best to ruin my wedding too. First, she had to fly out with us (it was a destination wedding) because \"She's all alooooooone!\" We get there, our room is ready, but hers isn't. No big deal. They offered to take her luggage and told her they would get her room ready shortly.  \n\nPrior to this, my husband had a very stressful couple of weeks of work, and his mom had also been driving him batshit about every detail of the trip, so he was a total crab for days. I had barely seen him smile for two weeks. So, now we're in paradise, beautiful weather, on the beach, cocktails in hand, and he's finally smiling. We run into his mom. \"Well, my room still isn't ready, so I just sat on the beach and cried!\" I watched his face fall and I've never wanted to punch someone so much in my life. \n\nAfter that I made his brother keep her away from us. As my husband is the older one, he's taken the brunt of her narcissistic abuse and it was his day and he deserved to be left alone. His mother still tried her darndest, constantly shouting at us at the pool because she wanted to take \"another picture!!\" My husband cracked on that finally, \"Can you just give it a rest? I just want to enjoy myself, not stop every five minutes for a photo!\" Queue MIL tears... \n\nAt the rehearsal dinner, my sister is going around having everyone sign the guest book that has photos of my husband and me growing up. She gets to MIL, who abruptly stands up and WAILS so everyone can hear her, \"I CAAAAAAAAAAAN'T!!!!!!!\" and runs out of the room crying. She of course wanted someone to run after her. She was PISSED no one did. Especially neither of her two boys who just ignored her antics. \n\nOn the day of the wedding, she had to be in every photo, literally front and center, in between my husband and me. \"I'm so SHORT! I need to be in the front!\" Um, no, you don't need to be right next to me. Front and center. But she can't stand NOT being the center of attention at all times. \n\nMother/son dance, she danced with her face buried in his chest, which was super awkward. \n\nDuring dinner, she kept clanking her glass to get us to kiss after I said \"We're doing this ONCE folks!\" because it was a small wedding and we didn't want to deal with it 24/7. She kept doing it, staring at me like a demon, \"clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!\" Everyone ignored her. She finally stopped. \n\nCake cutting, \"Oh, you don't want the cute little figurine on the top? Or to freeze the cake? Awwwww, you're not sentimental? Shame.\" It was a destination wedding, we paid for a package. Our cake was pretty but nothing special. No, I don't need the cheap plastic bride/groom on the top. And no, I'm not going to try to freeze a cake to bring home from Punta Cana. She also kept talking to my grandfather like he was deaf and senile and he was neither, which was royally pissing him off. He would take it for far longer than I expected him to and then yell at her and she would just treat him like he had Alzheimer's, which made him even MORE mad. I had to tell her to knock it off. Queue tears, \"I'm just trying to HEEEEEEELLLLP!!!!\"\n\nFinally, the limo ride back to the airport. She can see husband and I are both exhausted. I'm trying to nap, he's trying to watch a football game. She would. Not. Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Kept talking just to talk. Kept asking the most random questions to force us to talk to her. And when we got short with her, \"Why are you YELLING at me?!?\" No one was. Husband said, \"We're both tired, we just want some peace and quiet. MIL: \"Well, what am I supposed to do?!?\" Husband, \"I don't know! Look out the damn window or something!\" She pouted the rest of the drive, sighing heavily every few minutes.", "NTA she made y\u2019all\u2019s day about herself.

It will get worse not better when children are on the scene.\n\nIt can be very difficult for enmeshed kids and he may need therapy, but refusal to be in your corner after you have been treated so abysmally is a red flag. The fact he has already forgiven her is very concerning. \n\nRegardless of his position, YOU get to choose who you have to engage with - and don\u2019t choose anyone who makes your life harder not easier. Definitely do not choose spending your precious time and energy on someone who would purposefully ruin your wedding to be all about them!", "It's not just her that OP needs to worry about - it's husband, who is so emotionally dependent on Mom that he was completely thrown by her performance.\n\nMom got exactly what she wanted, but only bc son is emotionally unhealthy.\n\nNot a wise choice on the part of OP as to a partner.\n\nOP is in for a tough time. MIL is a narcissist, son is emotionally under his mother's thumb. Cringe.", "[removed]", "All of this.  And be prepared when you get your wedding pictures and she doesn't look good in any of them because she was too busy pouting, scowling and generally being difficult she is going to whine that the photographer was bad because they didn't get any good pictures of her.", "I\u2019m just shocked that they didn\u2019t come to the realization that she\u2019s a narcissist until the wedding. You\u2019d think they would have long seen a trend in her behavior and chosen not to make her responsible for anything important.", "What\u2019s actually needed is counseling for OP\u2019s husband. He needs outside help to figure out how to deal with someone like his mom. Until he\u2019s ready to go no contact, you can expect that she will escalate and continue to make his life miserable. Until he makes peace with the idea of low or no contact, he won\u2019t have the leverage to enforce any kind of boundary with her", "No she didnt smile in any photos, we've been told she wasn't even smiling in the professional ones but waiting to get these back. Might just photoshop these haha", "What do you feel is missing? Understand your point about focusing on each other, that's what I did , but partner as its his mother and he cares for a lot was visibly shaken and upset by it all. She wouldn't engage with any of our family or friends and kept making digs about the food, not changing the table plan. So he was upset on the verge of tears the entire day as we had no idea what we had done wrong at this point. Not smiling in any of our family pictures isn't just sulking it's actively ruining our memories and day. I don't agree that it's acceptable, but it's whether it's OK to move forward past it, which I'm guessing you think we should?", "Is that you, mom?", "Good advice thank you", "I\u2019ve learned I\u2019ve done that with my mothers behavior and it has taken A LOT from me in my life\u2019s. it\u2019s hard to see the first person you\u2019re supposed to have an attachment to as anything other than caring but yea. MIL could EASILY be my mother", "I can\u2019t promise I wouldn\u2019t have accidentally slipped on something, sadly spilling my wine.", "Unfortunately not, now it's happened I've started to add up signs but it has never been to this extent before. I guess for my partner its his mum and he knows no different?", "Right? I usually assumed people got to know their fianc\u00e9's family a fair bit before getting married unless the said fianc\u00e9 has cut them off and they'll have no effects in the marriage going further, which OP's husband didn't do. I'd assume conversation/common courtesy to get to know the in laws is as important as the do you want kids convo. Same thing, these people are going to be a part of your life (usually fair to assume so unless told otherwise) and you just don't discuss on that?", "Agreed.", "Make sure you give her a big blowup portrait of her scowl first!", "NTA - you asked what to do - I have such an MIL.  Will make everything about her at every event - even ruined her grandchild's graduation!  Sadly, this will have to be accepted by your husband and you and he will have to work together to set boundaries.  Unfortunately, it sounds like your husband has already forgiven her, so you both need to be on the same page.  I hope you can get there.  Being on the same page has saved my marriage.  We are contemplating visiting ( staying nearby, having her/FIL visit) next spring.  We haven't seen them since 2019!  Because she can't behave!", "I don't think her behavior is acceptable, but unless you're going to cut her out of your life, I say move on and just know she is likely going to be narcissistic at any future event that is not about her.", "Your situation reminds me a bit of my mother's.  There are things to this day she will complain about concerning her MIL on her own wedding day.  However, that did not stop her from having a closer relationship with my grandmother.  I wish the same for you, OP!", "Don\u2019t listen to them. Probably a narc MIL responding.", "It\u2019s taking me a lifetime to detach myself from my narcissistic mother. I still love her. I feel a rainbow of feelings. But I can\u2019t be in contact with her because it will hurt me every step of the way.", "I already commented this, but I wanted to respond directly to you. Go to r/JUSTNOMIL. So many good resources there.", "I wasn't aware that was a thing, Cookie.  Not a mother, personally, but I would consider it if the position of \"NARC MIL\" pays well enough.  What laws would I have to enforce?"]}
