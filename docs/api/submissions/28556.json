It was your big day, she should have been happy for you and suppressed negativity", "NTA, MIL sounds like a trainwreck of a human being, just destroying everything that her derailed self touches. Are everyone of your in laws like her? This sounds like the beginning of a nightmare. The odds of doing EVERY SINGLE THING wrong that you had specifically asked them to do right is just astronomically so low, this has to be deliberate.", "Honestly it seems harsh but I'm going with NTA.\n\nThis was a horrible thing for what should have been a very happy day. I'm sure you feel gutted that your new husband was crying on the happiest day of your lives.\n\nI'm getting married this week and my parents have also been actively trying to sabotage our happiness and it feels awful. The one thing I keep saying to myself is \"Okay this is shit to me. But would I allow them for a second to treat my  future children this way? Fuck no\".  I can't imagine I'll be having any sort of meaningful relationship with my parents going forward- as they'll never have an opportunity again to ruin well _anything_.\n\nI ask the same question to you and your husband- do you want her to have another opportunity to sabotage what should be exciting days in your relationship?", "There's nothing a narcissist likes better than to ruin a special day. It's their favourite thing.\n\nI'm sorry it ruined your day.\n\nPeople like your MIL thrive on chaos like this, it won't matter to her whether you forgive her or not, it won't make any difference to her behaviour now or in the future. That your husband has forgiven her for purposefully ruining your wedding day is seriously disappointing and doesn't fill me with hope for your future.\n\nThe very best thing both of you could do is to cut her off completely but I'm guessing you're some way off from that. In the meantime I suggest you both do some research on narcissistic  mothers  so you know what you're dealing with.\n\nBuckle up, you're in for a rough ride ahead.\n\nNTA", "If you are asking whether you should volunteer an \"I forgive you for your terrible, self-centered, childish, destructive behavior\" I would say, absolutely no, do not do that.  And, I would be surprised that someone like her, who is completely devoid of self-awareness, would actually ask that.\n\nAll that is required of you is civility.  You cannot lower yourself to her level, which is sub-human behavior.  But you are not required to be warm and fuzzy to her.  If she speaks to you, you respond with kindness.  Don't ignore her, but don't go out of your way necessarily to please her.\n\nWhy?  For your husband's sake.  A woman that would willingly make her own son cry on his wedding day has a tight hold on his emotional health, and it will take years to untangle that.  In the meantime, do not further burden your husband by contributing to that by having an all-out war with her, or passive-aggressive interactions that fuel further conflict.\n\nBest of luck.  Geographic distance, in the end, if your husband agrees, may be the best and most likely solution for success to the problem of a \"miserable MIL who lies to bestow misery\".", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your MIL is happiest when she is the center of attention, and if she isnt, she will do whatever she can to make sure everyone notices her in some way. (remember that old saying \"negative attention is better than none\")\n\nSince your husband has forgiven her, be prepared for future renditions of this kind of behavior (at your childs christening, at a first birthday party  -- you get the picture). \n\nBUT forwarned is for armed. Now that you know how she is, you can take steps to mitigate it. \n\nHow you do that is up to you, there are books and articles on it, and you now have time to research. It would be great if you could get your husband onboard with it, but since he's grown up with her being this way, it might be hard for him to actually see whats going on.\n\nRegardless, Im sorry she tried to ruin your wedding day!", "NTA\n\nShe chose you make you and your partner's big day a pity party for her, soaking in as  much attention as  she could.  She's probably a narcissist, but regardless, keeping minimal contact with her for a while would be good for your relationship.", "NTA.  This is your future, please prepare yourself for it.", "NTA\n\nShe did this on purpose, she knew exactly what she was doing. Suprised she did'nt turn up in a white dres in an attempt to up stage you!\n\nYou need to cut her out completely. \n\nSorry she is not going to change and will do her best to make you miserable at every turn.", "NTA. Why and how would you need to forgive someone who isn\u2019t sorry? She fully intended on being like this, she just thinks she found an excuse or reason to do so,  but she would have found any little thing to disrupt your day.  Remind your husband of this day, frequently, as you will need to, when it comes to things and times you want to not include her, give her the attention, etc.  it will likely not only continue but get worse", "Your spouse has been trained since birth to kowtow to her bullshit. Don\u2019t give in.

I had a LONG list of clusterf**ks that happened on the lead up and actual wedding day. We are now almost 30 years married. Unapologetically cut out toxic.

I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that but at least now you know her true face.\n\nDid she smile in the pictures? My mother couldn\u2019t even do that (nothing to do with the bride or groom) and of course blamed me for the look on her face that ruined every single picture she was in. \n\nWhat she didn\u2019t count on was photoshop. She thought she won by making the pictures about her, and was horrified to see she was totally cut out of some and had her face altered in the only family photo we gave to our families. Except for hers. She got the piss-face one to hang on her wall and remind everyone what kind of person she is. When my sister got married years later, mom wasn\u2019t even invited.", "ESH.  You two have her way too much power and responsibility.  He shouldn\u2019t be crying over his mom being a pain.  She obviously has been for a long time and it isn\u2019t going to stop voluntarily.  The only way to stop it is reduce contact and never depend on her for anything.  You two need to act like adults where the only person\u2019s happiness on that day that should have mattered was you two.  Why would you have such a person bring stuff and pick up stuff?", "NTA - but you are stuck with her for life, I have and obnoxious MIL.  I get it!

Sounds like it could have been a great day if you focused on each other instead of her. Me thinks you like the drama", "YWBTA\n\nI'm sorry that you feel the day was ruined by her, but I urge you not to start out your marriage by exiling your MIL.  What she did was wrong.  Absolutely.  But to hold this grudge forever..?  I think with the passage of time you will come to remember the good times of your wedding over the set involving your MIL.  Do not start the next chapter of your life with this thorn in your heart.", "NTA.

Let her know you need time, it will also allow you to see how sincere her apology is.\nIt's perhaps some kind of unresolved \"reversed oedipus complex': she doesn't want to loose her son to another woman. You and your husband probably better keep her far away from your life.", "NTA. Absolutely don't allow this slide.

You and he should discuss how best to create that relationship, and your responses to it,  within what you both need to be together on all interactions.", "NTA. Definitely time to go no contact with your MIL.  She decided to muck up your wedding so you definitely do no need her in your life.", "NTA - this isn't a forgiveness issue,  this is a don't put up with bad behavior issue.  She did what she did,  you can't change it. What you can change is the interaction going forward and that means there won't be any.", "As an adult child of a narc, I can confirm that it is incredibly difficult to go NC. I can also confirm that going NC is also the best decision you can make - 26yrs and counting for me. \n\nIt is incredibly hard to go NC because they are your family who we are hardwired to love. You're groomed & conditioned to believe that this abuse = love, to carry the emotional load of the parent, to accept blame for all of the narc's abuse and to carry responsibility & guilt -  you are trauma bonded. \n\nNarc's are usually more discreet about their abuse choosing instead to do it on private and have a fake public face where they're all smiles. It is very telling that she couldn't even pretend to be happy on her son's wedding day. Yes the attention has to be all about the narc but I'm guessing she's more upset about the fact that she's losing her supply. Everyone can also now see how appalling & vile she is - there's no concealing that fact no matter how much she gaslights her son. \n\nTo OP and OP's husband, I would recommend the youtube channels of Dr Ramani and Patrick Teahan. Both offer knowledgeable & compassionate insights & advise on narc abuse, psychopathy and dynamics & how to manage narcs using techniques such as grey rocking & firewalling. Patrick also produces videos where he role plays the right & wrong way to communicate with the narc - this will be very helpful to husband. I would also recommend the book The Dance of Anger by Harriet Lerner which advises on how to manage difficult people and feel guilt free when you do this. Depending on how trauma bonded your husband is, he may need counselling too - look for counsellors who specialise in complex ptsd and emotional abuse.\n\nWhether you have children or not, this situation is something you both need to resolve. If you are planning on having children, resolve this beforehand as I guarantee she'll harass & interfere, make your child birth experience entirely about her and sulk if you choose a name she doesn't approve of. \n\nIf your husband decides not to go NC then remind her that it is her interest to do as she's told if she wants you to be her carer - narc's can always be relied upon to act in self interest so it may be a good way to keep her in check. Do not give her the keys to your house and have external cameras installed. Never underestimate a narc's capacity to screw with your life, rifle through your belongings, violate your boundaries etc\n\nWe all want to love our parents and believe the best about them so coming to terms with the fact that your parents are actually monsters is the worst pill to swallow. I'm glad he has you to support him through this, as you move forward with your lives together, as he will need this as he comes to terms with the awful realisation that his mum is an abusive monster and he is a victim of abuse.\n\nLastly, but most importantly, congratulations on your wedding. I hope that you & your husband have an amazing & wonderful future together. Sincerely wishing you both all the very best.", "NTA\n\nShe is a narcissist and I suggest you go NC until you have a firm grasp on what that means. These people are unreal and you NEED to be equipped to handle them.", "cut her off for mental health reasons. NTA", "Oh, I feel you on this one... my MIL tried her best to ruin my wedding too. First, she had to fly out with us (it was a destination wedding) because \"She's all alooooooone!\" We get there, our room is ready, but hers isn't. No big deal. They offered to take her luggage and told her they would get her room ready shortly.  \n\nPrior to this, my husband had a very stressful couple of weeks of work, and his mom had also been driving him batshit about every detail of the trip, so he was a total crab for days. I had barely seen him smile for two weeks. So, now we're in paradise, beautiful weather, on the beach, cocktails in hand, and he's finally smiling. We run into his mom. \"Well, my room still isn't ready, so I just sat on the beach and cried!\" I watched his face fall and I've never wanted to punch someone so much in my life. \n\nAfter that I made his brother keep her away from us. As my husband is the older one, he's taken the brunt of her narcissistic abuse and it was his day and he deserved to be left alone. His mother still tried her darndest, constantly shouting at us at the pool because she wanted to take \"another picture!!\" My husband cracked on that finally, \"Can you just give it a rest? I just want to enjoy myself, not stop every five minutes for a photo!\" Queue MIL tears... \n\nAt the rehearsal dinner, my sister is going around having everyone sign the guest book that has photos of my husband and me growing up. She gets to MIL, who abruptly stands up and WAILS so everyone can hear her, \"I CAAAAAAAAAAAN'T!!!!!!!\" and runs out of the room crying. She of course wanted someone to run after her. She was PISSED no one did. Especially neither of her two boys who just ignored her antics. \n\nOn the day of the wedding, she had to be in every photo, literally front and center, in between my husband and me. \"I'm so SHORT! I need to be in the front!\" Um, no, you don't need to be right next to me. Front and center. But she can't stand NOT being the center of attention at all times. \n\nMother/son dance, she danced with her face buried in his chest, which was super awkward. \n\nDuring dinner, she kept clanking her glass to get us to kiss after I said \"We're doing this ONCE folks!\" because it was a small wedding and we didn't want to deal with it 24/7. She kept doing it, staring at me like a demon, \"clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!\" Everyone ignored her. She finally stopped. \n\nCake cutting, \"Oh, you don't want the cute little figurine on the top? Or to freeze the cake? Awwwww, you're not sentimental? Shame.\" It was a destination wedding, we paid for a package. Our cake was pretty but nothing special. No, I don't need the cheap plastic bride/groom on the top. And no, I'm not going to try to freeze a cake to bring home from Punta Cana. She also kept talking to my grandfather like he was deaf and senile and he was neither, which was royally pissing him off. He would take it for far longer than I expected him to and then yell at her and she would just treat him like he had Alzheimer's, which made him even MORE mad. I had to tell her to knock it off. Queue tears, \"I'm just trying to HEEEEEEELLLLP!!!!\"\n\nFinally, the limo ride back to the airport. She can see husband and I are both exhausted. I'm trying to nap, he's trying to watch a football game. She would. Not. Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Kept talking just to talk. Kept asking the most random questions to force us to talk to her. And when we got short with her, \"Why are you YELLING at me?!?\" No one was. Husband said, \"We're both tired, we just want some peace and quiet. MIL: \"Well, what am I supposed to do?!?\" Husband, \"I don't know! Look out the damn window or something!\" She pouted the rest of the drive, sighing heavily every few minutes.", "NTA she made y\u2019all\u2019s day about herself.

But you don\u2019t seem to care about her perspective, you think you can do whatever you want on your wedding day and not have any consequences.

I'm sorry she did this during your wedding. Remember the happy parts -- I'm sure there were many. It sounds like you have a caring and sensitive husband.

Sorry.", "NTA But you can't force your partner to make good boundaries. You make and explain your own boundaries and hopefully he'll learn from your example.", "I agree, she will repeat this or similar behavior any time she feels like she's not getting enough attention. Your husband has been groomed to not \"rock the boat\". You may or may not ever get him to understand this.\n\nDon't rock the boat.\n\n**Don't rock the boat.**  the following is copied from an earlier Reddit post. (You are not alone!) See reddit: Raised By Narcissists.\n\n\nI've been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because *we* aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\n\nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own. \n\n\nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking. \n\n\nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n\n\nBallast!\n\n\nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\n\n\nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, *because it did* .\n\n\nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that *you* aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\n\nNow you and your partner get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder. \n\n\nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something! \n\n\nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and your partner see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\n\n\nYou know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.", "NTA. Cut her off.", "Maybe don't go all out on psychological diagnosis based on half a page of a reddit post. Maybe the MIL is extremely sensitive and emotional, maybe she's extremely afraid of losing her son, maybe her life is in turmoil right now and what happened on the wedding day was just the straw that broke the camel's back. Who knows.\n\nCut her off completely? Seriously, what terrible advice based on so little information.\n\nRight. And to the people who downvoted my comment: How is it that psychiatrists refrain from making a diagnosis about someone without first having met them in person and talked to them at some length, but half a page of a reddit post is apparently enough for 1k+ redditors to be 100% sure that we're dealing with a narcissist here and the only solution is to cut off all contact?\n\nFFS people, don't be such dicks.", "Yeah, this whole post was...strange.
