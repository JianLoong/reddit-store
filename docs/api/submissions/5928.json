It\u2019s an open adoption, so I know the parents and they know me. The child (5yrs old) knows me too, they just don\u2019t know that I\u2019m their bio parent.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize I was pregnant until I was too far along to have other options. I was going through a lot emotionally at the time trying to cope with what made the pregnancy happen (not something I said yes to). My parents, mostly my mom (49f) kept pushing me to raise the child. Obviously I didn\u2019t.\n\nMy mom has had a hard time accepting that I do not think of myself as this child\u2019s mother in any capacity. They have a mom. A good one.

I will never be their mom. I do not want to be their mom.\n\nMy brother (25m) just had a baby with his fianc\u00e9e (25f), and for Christmas my mom got her a necklace with her and the baby\u2019s birthstone on it.\n\nI wasn\u2019t at the Christmas celebration my family had, since I was working that day, so my mom said she\u2019d just swing by with the gift she got me and I could hand off the gift I got her.\nWell she showed up today, and when I opened the box I saw that it was a necklace with my birthstone and the birthstone of the child I put up for adoption. I asked her why she got it for me and she said that she had been given a similar necklace when she became a mom and she wanted to do the same for me and bros fianc\u00e9e.\n\nI told her that I wasn\u2019t a mom, and that I wouldn\u2019t be wearing the necklace. She told me that the point of her getting it was so that I would wear it, and I said \u201cthat\u2019s too bad. Take it back.\u201d\n\nShe took the necklace and left but now she\u2019s incredibly upset with me. She thinks I\u2019m being ungrateful and disrespectful for rejecting a gift.\nI vented to my brother about it and he said I probably should have said thanks and just never let the thing see the light of day again, but he did think that our mom is overstepping the clear boundary that I\u2019ve set about this.\n\nI still feel bad. I know that she\u2019s probably just trying to handle the whole situation in her own way, and I\u2019m trying to handle it in mine, but I don\u2019t know if saying \u201cthat\u2019s too bad, take it back.\u201d was a little too harsh or not.", "created_utc": 1672316391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy439j/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_take_back_the_gift_she/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that you cared enough to make sure that the baby was placed up for adoption with good loving parents says more about you and your character than anything. The fact that you remain in touch with the family says even more. You are a good person. I know what it's like to say no and have that no disrespected. If I had been in the same situation, I don't know what I would have done. I as a mother do know that if my child was ever in that situation and made the hard decision to do what you were strong enough to do, I wouldn't pressure her to have maternal feelings for a child that she clearly didn't feel that way about. I understand that maybe she has grandmotherly feelings for the child and thinks that the only way she will ever have a relationship with the baby is for you to feel more than you do...but still she should have more respect for you and the decision you have made than to give a gift that would act as a constant reminder of the hurtful situation you were place in as a young woman.", "NTA\nYes it was nice that she didn't leave you out when buying one for your brother's partner however it is your right not to accept something that you don't feel comfortable about.", "NTA, you have established clear lines and boundaries with your mum and situation.

If i have  understood this correctly, you experienced trauma and made the best decision for you. You should be able to move on and live your life without someone else regularly telling you, however subtle they try to be, that they think you made the wrong choice. \nShe might be upset over what she thought was a thoughtful gift, but you have to establish a boundary. Could you have been softer in your delivery? Possibly. But would she have heard you? Maybe not.\nThe fact that she is upset shows she is making this about her, and not the underlying problem. Give her a day or two then sit down for a chat to try and explain why you felt you had to be so firm. \nI doubt you need to wear a reminder of the event, and the difficult choices that meant you had to make. It is a bit bonkers that she doesnt consider that.", "NTA. That seems more like a gift for herself than anything else. Her coping skills need to be revisited for sure.", "NTA.

He's not your child. You're not his mom. That doesn't make you any less special to each other, but you know where the boundaries are.", "NTA.  Your mom may mean well, but does she KNOW what it's like to be violated in that way and then end up with a forever reminder about the incident?  She clearly needs to understand that you experienced a trauma that will forever change you, and the very last thing your mental and emotional health needs is to see a physical reminder of a non-consensual trauma that was inflicted upon you daily.   It can be very difficult for a survivor to come to love a child in that situation, and there is NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING UNABLE TO DO THAT.  Ask your mom how she would feel if her body autonomy choices were taken away without her consent?  This is not about her, this is about what is best for your mental, emotional and physical well being, and about the well being of the child as well.  You made a very thoughtful and difficult decision, but you are okay with it and she needs to be okay with the decision that's best for YOU. \n\nSeems like she is substituting the gift rejection as a \"you are rejecting me and my needs about \"MY\" grandchild\", when in fact, it isn't about her at all.  It's about you establishing a boundary, voicing your boundary and she unfortunately doesn't want to respect that boundary (sometimes parents do that, it may take a while for her).   I hope you and mom can eventually get past this.  If you see a therapist, maybe ask if she could come to a session or two, so that maybe with a third party, she could be more receptive and open to hearing you.", "NTRA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSHE is the AH", "NTA. you said it yourself, you're not a mom. you're a birthgiver.", "NTA. You made an incredibly difficult decision 5 years ago and your mother is retraumatizing you every time she does something like this. She probably doesn't realize it because she's not trying to put herself in your shoes. Accepting the gift would have reinforced her continued disrespect of your feelings.", "\n\nI'm going to try to put myself in your mums shoes because it doesn't seem like she's coming from a place of malice.\n\nYou may not feel like a mother but your mum probably does feel like a grandmother. She IS a grandmother, at least biologically. She's probably still coming to terms with not having her grandchild in her life and there's a certain grief that comes with that...she's powerless in the whole situation but it still affects her. \n\nHer buying you that gift etc. might be her way of trying to include the child in some capacity - to have him/her be part of the family in some small way. There was probably a level of guilt involved for her...buying your brothers fiancee that gift, acknowledging that grandchild...but not the other.\n\nIt's complex. How you feel about the child you birthed isn't how she feels.\n\nYou're NTA but I wouldn't be hard on her, either.", "NTA \nYour mum isn\u2019t willing to accept your decision and leave it alone. If anything she\u2019s TA for continuously pushing your boundaries. You may have given birth to the LO but you are not her mum in any other sense of the word, you did what was best for the LO under the circumstances, the sooner your mum accepts this and moves on the better. If you go on to have a child and raise it THEN she can get a similar gift for you, but she needs to stop. it\u2019s easy to say what you should have done under your circumstances when you haven\u2019t gone through it yourself. Unless your mum went through what you did she can\u2019t judge or tell you what you should or shouldn\u2019t have done or continue to push you.", "NTA. Not at all. Wow. Your mother was being incredibly cruel and insensitive with a \"gift\" like this. Seriously, sometimes I can't fathom how human beings can be so thoughtless and cruel, especially towards someone they love. Absolutely, give the gift back and set these boundaries with your mother.", "NTA. You were very clear with your mom about how you feel and what you want. She is the one who is not respecting your wishes and is instead trying to push her own agenda onto you.", "NTA.  It's been five years and your mother needs to understand the child you gave birth too is not your child.  I think being blunt in this situation is warranted.", "NTA - it sounds like your mom wants to be a grandma to the child you birthed. She should probably seek counseling. She\u2019s disrespecting you and the necklace is probably just one example of it. Best of luck with this situation. You did nothing wrong here.", "NTA\n\nNTA\n\nI tell you three times NTA. \n\nIf anything, you under-reacted.  Your response should have made it vehemently clear to your mother that what she did was traumatizing, demeaning, and outright insensitive. \n\nAs stated, you do not have a daughter. You know that you do not have a daughter. She knows that you do not have a daughter. \n\nAsk her if \u2018making\u2019 you have a daughter is so important to her that she is willing to lose her daughter (you) over the matter?\n\n\n(And I hope that you are able to ensure that your mother is never in contact with this little girl because you just know that she will inevitably say something about this. A child should eventually learn about her origins, but not when she is five, and not from her biological grandmother)", "NTA, she knowingly overstepped a very clear boundary, your reaction was actually quite mild in my opinion. I mean, it's not like she said something, slip of a tongue, whatever. She went, bought the necklace, had it at least for some time and then came and gave it to you. She had time to reflect on this, and still went ahead and did it.\n\nI understand that she might be trying to cope, but that's no reason to force you to help her do that. You are the one who was the most affected, and in no way any shred of her coping should be on you. You're handling this whole situation brilliantly, and nobody should be making it even a little bit harder than it already is.", "NTA - You poor thing. Not only have you suffered a terrible trauma but your mother seems determined to re-traumatise you at every opportunity. If your mother cannot be made to understand this then you may be better off removing her from your life.", "NTA\n\nyou could have \" said thanks and just never let the thing see the light of day again\" but then the precedent has been set of you accepting gifts from your mum which are all about the child you had to give up.", "NTA. You made a decision in both your and the baby's best interests and I love hearing how you speak about their mum. Your mum just doesn't sound like she respects that at all. I assume she knows how the pregnancy came about - she really has to understand that just because there's a biological link, it doesn't follow that you are the parent. You're not mum here, you don't see yourself as mum, and your mum doesn't seem to get this. I was also adopted but feel absolutely no link to biological parents and it'd be incredibly inappropriate for anybody to get me a gift linking me to them. \n\nPlease don't feel bad. If you had accepted it without saying anything, then it would send the wrong message to your mum.", "NTA, your mother was so far over the line she could no longer see it.", "NTA your mom knows how you feel about it and still isn't respecting your decision on the matter. In a way this also could have been an emotionally manipulation tool by giving you some kind of constant reminder of the child.", "NTA. But your mother is for not respecting this boundary you have. You made a good decision for you and the child in the situation and she can't get over it. Sounds like she could use some therapy to work through her feelings and the insistence that you are more than the biological mom.", "This made me laugh lol thank you \ud83d\ude2d", "Thank you. I\u2019m trying my best :\u2019) It\u2019s taken me a lot of time, and I\u2019m still not totally \u201cokay\u201d yet so I guess I understand why my mom is still having issues.", "I don't know, all the people refusing clothes that don't fit, jewelry with their deadnames on it, subscriptions to things that they hate or are allergic to--I think that they're within their rights to refuse gifts as well. It's decently common on here.", "She doesn\u2019t know them. I told the parents that I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with the child knowing my extended family. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d ever go so far as to contact them or anything like that.", "Thank you. I know it\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault any more than it is mine, it\u2019s just an awful situation we both ended up \u201cmeeting\u201d through I guess. I knew I couldn\u2019t be their mom, so I at least wanted them to have a good one. They deserve a good life and a happy childhood and it makes me feel better to know that they are getting that. I knew my trauma about the whole thing would make it hard for me to give them the life they deserved. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to put them through that.", "Thank you. I\u2019m going to try to explain to her that the gift and her insistence on labeling me as a mom is just a reminder of everything that happened. I wish it wasn\u2019t, but it is, and I\u2019d like to just have a second where I don\u2019t have to acknowledge what occurred. I guess she just doesn\u2019t understand why I feel the way that I do because she thinks she would\u2019ve handled it all differently.", "Malice isn\u2019t required just indifference. And the op\u2019s mother is being completely indifferent to the Ops stated wishes.", "There is a ring theory of grief that applies in this situation. You are the center of a series of concentric circles. Comfort is the only thing people should be giving you. All the trauma and grief expressions go outward to people outside the center. Your mom is centering herself in your grief. She needs to seek support from someone *outside* of her ring in the circle. She can't dump this on you.

You did well and I can understand the harsh words, sometimes all of the nice ones are just out of stock.", "You did the right thing, the best thing for that child.

I've read the examples and I guess I had a stroke. They sound definitely bad now that I've reread lmao"]}
