I understand that maybe she has grandmotherly feelings for the child and thinks that the only way she will ever have a relationship with the baby is for you to feel more than you do...but still she should have more respect for you and the decision you have made than to give a gift that would act as a constant reminder of the hurtful situation you were place in as a young woman.", "NTA\nYes it was nice that she didn't leave you out when buying one for your brother's partner however it is your right not to accept something that you don't feel comfortable about.", "NTA, you have established clear lines and boundaries with your mum and situation.

Your mom may mean well, but does she KNOW what it's like to be violated in that way and then end up with a forever reminder about the incident?  She clearly needs to understand that you experienced a trauma that will forever change you, and the very last thing your mental and emotional health needs is to see a physical reminder of a non-consensual trauma that was inflicted upon you daily.   It can be very difficult for a survivor to come to love a child in that situation, and there is NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING UNABLE TO DO THAT.  Ask your mom how she would feel if her body autonomy choices were taken away without her consent?  This is not about her, this is about what is best for your mental, emotional and physical well being, and about the well being of the child as well.  You made a very thoughtful and difficult decision, but you are okay with it and she needs to be okay with the decision that's best for YOU. \n\nSeems like she is substituting the gift rejection as a \"you are rejecting me and my needs about \"MY\" grandchild\", when in fact, it isn't about her at all.  It's about you establishing a boundary, voicing your boundary and she unfortunately doesn't want to respect that boundary (sometimes parents do that, it may take a while for her).   I hope you and mom can eventually get past this.

You made an incredibly difficult decision 5 years ago and your mother is retraumatizing you every time she does something like this.

She IS a grandmother, at least biologically. She's probably still coming to terms with not having her grandchild in her life and there's a certain grief that comes with that...she's powerless in the whole situation but it still affects her. \n\nHer buying you that gift etc. might be her way of trying to include the child in some capacity - to have him/her be part of the family in some small way. There was probably a level of guilt involved for her...buying your brothers fiancee that gift, acknowledging that grandchild...but not the other.\n\nIt's complex. How you feel about the child you birthed isn't how she feels.\n\nYou're NTA but I wouldn't be hard on her, either.", "NTA \nYour mum isn\u2019t willing to accept your decision and leave it alone. If anything she\u2019s TA for continuously pushing your boundaries. You may have given birth to the LO but you are not her mum in any other sense of the word, you did what was best for the LO under the circumstances, the sooner your mum accepts this and moves on the better. If you go on to have a child and raise it THEN she can get a similar gift for you, but she needs to stop. it\u2019s easy to say what you should have done under your circumstances when you haven\u2019t gone through it yourself.

Seriously, sometimes I can't fathom how human beings can be so thoughtless and cruel, especially towards someone they love. Absolutely, give the gift back and set these boundaries with your mother.", "NTA. You were very clear with your mom about how you feel and what you want.

Your response should have made it vehemently clear to your mother that what she did was traumatizing, demeaning, and outright insensitive. \n\nAs stated, you do not have a daughter. You know that you do not have a daughter. She knows that you do not have a daughter. \n\nAsk her if \u2018making\u2019 you have a daughter is so important to her that she is willing to lose her daughter (you) over the matter?\n\n\n(And I hope that you are able to ensure that your mother is never in contact with this little girl because you just know that she will inevitably say something about this.

She had time to reflect on this, and still went ahead and did it.\n\nI understand that she might be trying to cope, but that's no reason to force you to help her do that. You are the one who was the most affected, and in no way any shred of her coping should be on you. You're handling this whole situation brilliantly, and nobody should be making it even a little bit harder than it already is.", "NTA - You poor thing.

If your mother cannot be made to understand this then you may be better off removing her from your life.", "NTA\n\nyou could have \" said thanks and just never let the thing see the light of day again\" but then the precedent has been set of you accepting gifts from your mum which are all about the child you had to give up.", "NTA. You made a decision in both your and the baby's best interests and I love hearing how you speak about their mum. Your mum just doesn't sound like she respects that at all. I assume she knows how the pregnancy came about - she really has to understand that just because there's a biological link, it doesn't follow that you are the parent. You're not mum here, you don't see yourself as mum, and your mum doesn't seem to get this. I was also adopted but feel absolutely no link to biological parents and it'd be incredibly inappropriate for anybody to get me a gift linking me to them. \n\nPlease don't feel bad.

I\u2019m going to try to explain to her that the gift and her insistence on labeling me as a mom is just a reminder of everything that happened.

Your needs are paramount, and what your mother is doing to \"heal\" from a 5 year delay in being a grandma (which is only a \"delay\" because of your unplanned and unwanted pregnancy) is trampling on your needs and is incredibly disrespectful and (imo) cruel.

If she can't, her ass needs to go to therapy.", "NTA\n\nShe gave you a gift she knew you would not appreciate and would hurt your feelings.\n\n\nThis is like\u2026 idk.. giving someone who just lost their partner tickets to a singles event. Like, dude. Leave it.", "NTA.  Your mother is overstepping.  I hope that her overstepping isn't causing you to relive the situation.  \n\nGiven how many times you've asked her to back-off about the situation, I seriously don't think your tone or what you said was rude.", "Trade out your birthstone for your mom's and make it a grandmother ring for her. I think she might actually like that a lot. NTA", "NTA\n\nAn idea, if you like it someday. Maybe keep the necklace and if one day your biokid asks to meet the family they can give her the necklace. Let her know she was not forgotten.\n\nI think it would matter to her, especially since it\u2019s an open adoption (I\u2019m guessing that means she would know who you are eventually). \n\nI get you don\u2019t want it for yourself, so maybe your mom can keep it and pass it on to her directly one day. It is a kind thought, just shouldn\u2019t be aimed at you imho", "NTA \nThis isn\u2019t a sweater in purple when you\u2019ve told her you hate the color 3 times. You\u2019ve made clear your boundaries and she\u2019s chosen to bring something incredibly painful to the surface. \nThe purple sweater? Sure, take it and donate it. This? No. It deserves a stand. I think it\u2019s time to explain the pain it brings up for you every time she forces this memory and commemoration.", "I don't think it was too harsh at all. I think you're at your wits end and it came out in frustration after your mum keeps trampling over your boundaries. I'm sorry for how your child was conceived and it sounds like you made the best decision for yourself and the child. NTA", "NTA and I had similar things happen when I placed a child for (an open) adoption 12years ago. His parents are amazing, but my family never quite coped. The first couple of years was spent receiving baby gifts and such. It made me feel bad to decline, but he wasn't mine. Eventually I just needed to go LC until everyone reached their levels of acceptance. \n\nThat said, it's kind of mean that she would give that gift. Adoption is a difficult thing to self process even if it's the best thing for you and child.", "This isn\u2019t a gift. This is someone - the very person who\u2019s meant to protect you against this kind of shit, by their own standards, btw - dismissing your decisions and trying to rewrite history to make themselves comfortable. Fuck that shit. So sorry you\u2019ve had to go through this and I completely understand and support why you\u2019d reject this gesture. NTA in any way shape or form!", "NTA", "NTA. This isn't about the necklace this is about your mom wanting to guilt you into getting her \"grandbaby\" back and destroying the happy life of that kid to make her feel better. Your mom is a narcissist.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nSure, maybe you could have made your rejection softer \u2026 or maybe she could have listened to you at ANY POINT in the last five years and known not to get you such a terrible \u201cgift\u201d", "NTA\n\nMy heart goes out to you for the situation that ended up bring this child into the world.  You are an incredible mature and STRONG woman to give up this child and be so respectful to the child's mom.  Your mom, not so great.  I think your mom wants you to regret giving up the child for adoption.  Your post shows nothing but happiness for the child you brough into the world.  As a mom myself, I'm proud of you.", "NTA. My fucking god. I\u2019m so sorry. NTA 100000%. Your mom is VILE.", "So\u2026after five years she is still \u201ctrying to handle the whole situation\u201d?? No offense to your mom but my dogs learn faster than that.  In fact, maybe a way to drill it home to your mom is to have a squirt bottle with water around and when she calls you a mom (or anything along that line) give her a nice little spray of water.\n\nNTA by the way", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. I wouldve given it to the childs mom, and told both her & your mom who it belongs to. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nSure, your mom is probably grieving and trying to cope with not having the grandchild she feels she is owed, but now she can smother the new baby with love and leave you alone. She is way overstepping your boundaries. Your mom is TA.", "NTA. Not your mom\u2019s business to try to force you to feel a certain way about the child you put up for adoption. I think she\u2019s being ungrateful and disrespectful of the sacrifice you made to carry that baby to term and make sure she was placed with a loving family and the fact that you\u2019re a grown adult who can make your own decisions. She owes you the apology.", "NTA but your mom is NTA either. As a birth grandmother I can sympathize with the entire situation. Making an adoption plan is not an easy decision to accept for many  birth family members. Some of them want to cling to whatever connection to the child they can have, and struggle to let that go. Be patient with your mom, but stick to your guns. Gentle hugs to you for your love and selflessness. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - shame  she did that to you ... very inappropriate to cross your boundary ... she needs therapy ... it would be gracious of you to forgive her, but nothing wrong with holding your ground so she learns to never do it again", "Giving the fact that you have contact with child and adopted parent, it seems a little like she may want you to feel bad about your decision. It has been 5 yrs, she needs to let things go, you are at peace with your choice.  In her heart, maybe she thought she was doing something nice, I probably would have accepted it, and said nothing.  Nobody seems like the ass here,  just a bit more communication about feelings.  Good luck with everything.", "NTA!! you could have been a little more gentle but i see your point. your mom crossed a boundary", "I think you brother was right, you could have just said thanks and buried the thing. However, your mum was also super out of line given how your background story behind his pregnancy", "You are absolutely NTA and your mother is way out of line.", "NAH - it was a nice but maybe hazardous gesture from your mother, and you were right telling her you are not at easy with that.\nI guess you need to explain her how you really feel about this adoption.", "I always say pregnancy does not make someone a mother. You are an incredible person for choosing a deserving mother for the baby you created. Perhaps you should make amends with your mother, who I know you know is just not coping well and probably not intending to hurt you. Ask her for the necklace back and add your adoptive mom's birthstone to it, and gift it to your adoptive mom instead. I'm sure she'd be honored to wear your birthstone together with her baby's and it'll possibly get the message across to your mother that the necklace made it to the right person after all.", "The way I've seen it put on here before is that gifts aren't obligations. Just as someone is free to give you something, you are free to reject it. If you purchased someone a burger when they said they weren't hungry, would you expect/force them to eat it anyway? Probably not.", "Just as someone is free to give you something, you are free to reject it.", "Agreed. It's been 5 years. If she hasn't been able to handle this on her own by now, she needs help to do so.", "It\u2019s been five years and there were permanent changes because of the decision to put the child up for adoption. Like even if OP changes her mind about it (which doesn\u2019t even seem like something that is going to happen), she can\u2019t just undo the adoption. So the mom bringing this up constantly is not helpful in any regard. Plus I\u2019m sure that reminder isn\u2019t good for OP\u2019s mental health.", "You don\u2019t ever need to be someone who has to understand your mother\u2019s issues with this. She is your mom. It is her job to understand any issues you are having with things and be there for you. It isn\u2019t on you to make her feel better about your pain.\n\nI gave a baby up for adoption 31 1/2 years ago. I couldn\u2019t tell you how long it took me to be okay, or if you ever really are fully okay with this kind of thing. But as a mother to my own two children, I do know that when my kids are hurting and it causes me pain as well, it is never up to them to console me. \n\nI hope this makes sense. Do whatever you need to do to help heal your heart, however long that may take. \u2764\ufe0f", "Do you understand how exactly the baby OP gave birth to was conceived?  Those exact circumstances would mean that this specific gift - however well intentioned - is incredibly ignorant of the situation and very hurtful to OP.\n\nOP's mother had 5 very long years to get into her thick skull why OP does not want to be a mom to this specific kid. At this point, it's not sweet or well-intentioned, it's trying to steamroll OP's boundaries and feelings. OP's mother just behaves like a gigantic asshole.", "OP has pretty much made it clear that the child is a product of being raped and because it was discovered so late, they were forced to carry them and give birth. The mother knows. It was years ago now. That's one of the most insanely traumatizing things a person can go through. The mother is being disgusting and centering wanting to be a grandmother over the actual situation and the trauma her child went through.", "Those can be returned or exchanged this necklace cannot", "I like this suggestion", "I think this is a time to be super direct. Like \u201cplease stop reminding me that I was raped. It\u2019s hurtful and honestly weird you keep bringing it up like it\u2019s something positive\u201d", "OP your mom does understand your feelings but she doesn't care. Your mom is only concerned with having a grandbaby. She's most likely trying to pressure you into getting her grandbaby back...for her.", "<<sometimes all of the nice ones are just out of stock.>>\n\nI very much like this turn of phrase.  Thank you for the introduction.", "Jumping on this comment - this link sums up the ring theory pretty well too and provides a worksheet to fill in names for anyone grieving or experiencing trauma, or even for those who is in contact with a grieving loved one \ud83d\ude0a it's one of many excellent tools to provide help for anyone going through a stressful time and I love that the information is more readily available and shared! \n\nhttps://speakinggrief.org/get-better-at-grief/supporting-grief/ring-theory\n\nEdited for spelling", "oh shit no, sorry, i just quickly read through that, IATA", "You get very little when you resell jewelry.

It's selfish and cruel and *not* the actions of a good mother. I'll reach out when I am ready to talk to you.' \n\nI know why you feel like an asshole but you're not and she's at best, being a bad mom. Be blunt and point that shit out. She's not being considerate of you or your feelings at all, time to return that energy. \n\nFunny how you're disrespectful for enforcing a known boundary but she's not for literally being cruel for her own selfish reasons.\n\nYou know what, skip all of that and ask her if she even loves you.
