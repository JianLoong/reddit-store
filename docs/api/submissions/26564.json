Anyway, I said please don\u2019t drink beforehand. Any other day is fine but for that one night. She said it helps her relax and she is still on guard and on top of my child. I don\u2019t pay her but I bought her dinner and dessert. I trust her with that but alcohol can make you react slower etc. I asked her if she watched my sisters kid who live away if she would drink beforehand but she said no because she has a different relationship with me and it\u2019s her house and her life. When I told her a little while ago, she threw her wine glass in the sink and said she never gets out and is tired of being controlled. She really does help me out tremendously and I\u2019m thankful for her. She lets me sleep in sometimes and helps out a lot. But at night, she enjoys her 2 glasses of wine.

She doesn\u2019t owe you child care. The solution is simple; don\u2019t go out and leave her with your child. \n\nThe question is are you ta or is she. The answer is, you\u2019re responsible for your child, not her. So she doesn\u2019t have to stop drinking wine to watch your child\u2026you\u2019re not paying her\u2026so her choosing to drink doesn\u2019t make her ta, but if you leave your child with her in an altered state, that would make YTA. \n\nExpecting her to watch your kid, in addition to what she already does, also makes y ta. \u2018For one night I ask\u2019\u2026welcome to parenthood. You\u2019re not entitled to nights out if you can\u2019t cover your kid. And it\u2019s not her job. \n\nShe has no obligation to not drink a few glasses of wine if she wants.", "YTA. Two glasses of wine is not an excessive amount and you say it\u2019s three hours before. \n\nBut more importantly, you\u2019re not paying her and she\u2019s doing you a favor. If you hire a babysitter then you can dictate that they not drink even a drop if you\u2019re uncomfortable with it. But it\u2019s ridiculous for you to dictate that to your mom in this situation.", ">it\u2019s her house and her life.\n\nShe is **exactly right about this**. You are lucky to have a place to live, if you try and control your mom's behavior, she may kick you out. YTA", "YTA It is your mother's place and it seems you are using her for free baby sitting. Get a professional and you can dictate terms. Also the fact that you are suggesting this happened a few times and you found later tells me you do this on the regular. \n\nYTA also for not sharing that your baby daddy and you are going to the movies. Where does baby daddy live? And how does he pitch in?", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou can ask, but she said she wanted to drink wine and you didn't let it go. \n\nIf you hire someone,  you can dictate the rules.  But you didn't hire her. She's babysitting the child for free.  If you don't like her choices, don't go out without your child.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou are basically a guest at your parents house and they are helping you for free.\n\nThe house should be somewhat toddler-proofed at this point.\n\nThe kid should probably be in bed by like 7-8pm anyways\n\n2 glasses of wine isn\u2019t excessive\n\nI feel like you guys could compromise and say no wine until after child is in bed?", "It is your responsibility to find another baby sitter. I don\u2019t blame you for being worried about her drinking prior. However, she is already doing a massive amount for you. She shouldn\u2019t have to babysit as well.", "YTA. Pay a babysitter", "YTA 100%.  Living n your moms home, rent free, also expecting free babysitting so you can go out & party.   Where\u2019s the baby\u2019s daddy?  Where\u2019s grandpa?  Why is it your moms responsibility?  And you have the Kahonies to be upset with her\u2026when the whole situation comes from you being irresponsible.   My advice, pay for a babysitter and take you mom out.  Stop using her.  If her drinking is a totally abusive situation, then you need to leave with your child.

I don\u2019t make a lot of money at the moment. I understand wanting her to unwind during the weekend. and every night she enjoys her glasses which is great but we both agreed no drinking when babysitting and I saw her continuing too anyway.

You're not entitled to your mom doing it for free though, if she is insisting on drinking earlier in the night you find someone else. The interaction between the 2 of you is AHish on both parts.", "YTA. Find someone else to watch your kid.", "NTA you have full right to dictate the state in which the person who is watching your child is in. Yes you aren't paying her but that shouldn't matter. If two glasses of wine is more important to her than her grandchild she needs to rethink some things. Honestly I would never even consider drinking at any point in the day before babysitting it just seems unsafe and I wouldn't trust myself fully.", "You have every right to not want someone inebriated watching your child, and I don't think it's an asshole move to simply ask but obviously she didn't take it well so now the responsible thing to do is find a more reliable babysitter (that you'll have to pay) or stop going out.", "YTA  \nYou...  \nDon't pay her and just expect free child care just so you can go to the movies  \nLive at her house for free  \nDon't give her much warning from the sounds of it  \n\n\nIt's also just wine... I'd understand if it was something strong, but litterally just wine. Two glasses of wine is hardly gonna make a difference.", "YTA. \n\nMove out, start behaving like an adult and stop micromanaging your mam when she's doing you a favour watching your kid. She doesn't have to babysit. Or let you and the kiddo live in her house rent free. You're taking advantage. \n\nAlso if she's only having one/two drinks and hours before she's due to babysit, what's the issue? Even if she's as much of a \"lightweight\" as you claim, or physically a tiny person, it's  impossible for her still to be impaired several hours later. Alcohol as much as is in in a standard drink or two, is metabolised within a couple of hours, even if you are unusually small for an adult or unused with drinking.", "NTA. Once a month... one Saturday night. Asking her to lay off the booze for *one* night out of 30 when looking after her grandchild? Not a lot to ask.\n\nThose saying you can't dictate to her because you aren't paying are missing the point in my opinion, why on *earth* would you drink when babysitting your grandchild anyway?", "NTA\n\n*I asked her if she watched my sisters kid who live away if she would drink beforehand but she said no because she has a different relationship with me and it\u2019s her house and her life. When I told her a little while ago, she threw her wine glass and said she never gets out and is tired of being controlled*\n\nWTF. There is no way I'd be letting this woman watch my kid, wine or no wine, until she sorts herself out. This is not about being controlled, it's about being a responsible adult, which clearly she is not at this point.", "This kind of seems like a you get what you pay for situation.\n\nIt's possible your mom has a dependence on alcohol. \n\nIt may be that you don't want her watching your kid after drinking. That's fine, it's good parenting not to leave a toddler in care of someone who is tipsy.\n\nBut then it's on you to make other arrangements.\n\nIn general it sounds like both of you need more space and boundaries with each other. It's up to you as the parent of the kid to arrange more childcare options and relieve the burden on her too.", "NTA\n\nI know to most people two glasses of wine is not a problem. But to some people it is. (I know. I'm one of them.) \n\nIf two glasses of wine really makes that much of a difference to your mother's behavior, then I'd be concerned. And if she can't give up two glasses of wine once a month ---- she's got a drinking problem. She could even satisfy her craving to drink after you've picked up the kid.", "NTA. She can't get away from her drinking problem for one night out of the month?", "NTA.  This is about the safety of your children.  No amount of alcohol is ok .", "YTA. You live in her house, she takes care of your toddler (which is something she shouldn't be doing because grandmas aren't babysitters) and yet you have the nerve to tell her what to do.

Then drive over and watch my children.  Why is this even here?", "Obviously, your Mom is being irresponsible for drinking before watching a child. However, you don't get to escape criticism for leaving your child with someone you know to be intoxicated. The bigger problem is that your Mom is right that it is her home that she is letting you and your child live in so she doesn't have to change to accommodate you. Your free babysitter sucks, but you are getting what you pay for.
