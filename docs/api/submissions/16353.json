Somehow it was ok to visit and be closer to my BIL's family, but not me. I am very OK with it, I don't mind it. I keep to myself, not everyone has to be best friends with their siblings. They visit my area of the city often to meet their friends and even let Abby stay over at theirs', while it was always a problem (some important event) whenever I had asked to let her stay over at mine. (I am single and stay by myself, no roommates). Whatever her reason, I am not that attached to Abby anymore and I don't mind the 'emotional' distance.\n\nBut then recently she asked me if I would do it for her. I replied with 'No' \"Can't', 'Don't feel like' \"Don't want to' -  to all her texts that asked for the reason or gave me a reason for why it was nothing or why it was easy. AITA was replying to her this way? Her reply insinuated that I was being a bad sister. I even added 'You should have taken care of this before you planned the holiday'\n\nMy reason: because I just don't want to. And I am sure they have several other options. It actually offends me that they ask me because they think just because I am single, I have nothing to do or that how I choose to spend my free time is something they can have opinions on.\n\nEDIT: She knows why I avoid visiting her. I told her!

Maybe you should have that frank conversation with her if you want to salvage the relationship.  If not, I get it.   I have a sister who I haven\u2019t spoken with for 7 years and if I never speak to her again, that\u2019s fine too.", "NTA but for them to have a better understanding i would share the second paragraph of this post with them. Your reason is not a simple you don't want to, your reason is what you said in that paragraph.", "Nta.   \n\nWhy exactly do you have to babysit the grandmother?", "NTA - No is no, she can't force you to babysit", "NTA especially if they are sticking you with the responsibility of watching over 3 people without even offering you any money for the time you'll be babysitting. I get that it's family and if she was smarter and you had a closer relationship with her family I would be inclined to say yeah you should do your family favors but given what you've explained that she's done, I wouldn't be volunteering my life and energy to be doing her any favors either.", "As a mother of two children who travel a lot for work, it\u2019s wild to me your sister did not have childcare in place before making travel arrangements. \n\nI did not realize one could simply up and toss their children to a relative and jet off to a vacation without a care in the world.", "NTA but I would elaborate to your sister that your lack of willingness to babysit is the direct consequence of her removing the children from your life and allowing for a proper aunt/nibbling relationship.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has deliberately put a distance between you and Abby.  She can't expect you to drop everything and babysit Abby, her younger sister and Granny.\n\nI'd be asking your sister who she had lined up and how did that fall through because you sound like a back up rather than a first choice.  Maybe Granny was the baby sitter but they've realised that may not be as safe as they thought because Granny's cognitive abilities may be declining and it may not be safe for her drive the kids around.\n\nDo you know the reason for for the distance between you?  And are you male or female?  If you are male that might be part of the reason (fear rather than anything else).  But if you are female there's more going on and your sister may be the only one that knows why.", "'I don't want to' is a fair reason. NTA\n\nHowever, I would reach out to your niece - none of this is her fault and you should make sure she knows that. Otherwise the kids are likely to blame themselves.", "ESH You don\u2019t know why she\u2019s shutting you out.  You complain about it but seem to actually like not being involved.  You won\u2019t explain to her why you won\u2019t babysit but will go into detail for us.", "YTA. There are other people involved here besides you and your sister. You complain that you're no longer as close to Abby and then say you're not that attached to her anymore so don't care. And it sounds like you were never attached to Frey. It doesn't sound like any of this was their fault but it sounds like you're happy to pass up the chance to reconnect with them in order to use them as a weapon against your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They put distance between you and the kids and never let them stay with you, until they need you and then you're the bad sibling for not helping. They sounds like the AHs", "because old, and might need help! They have a cleaner so that's not an issue. And yeah as I said they have a huge social circle in their area!", "Idk if its worth getting into a argument now.", "Female. And honestly, whatever the reason is, I have given 2 whole years being anxious about it. This past year I finally accepted it and I don't really want to keep asking for something that I might not get. I'd rather focus my energy on other parts of life.\nBut being called a bad person or a selfish person for not wanting to prioritize her over me just brought me back to this spiral of anxiety and overthinling. I can't even imagine the million other ways it will increase if I'd agreed to.", "Aah.. that's the part that still hurts.. and the fact that she's newly teenaged doesnt help a lot. I just don't know what she's actually feeling about it or just everything in general. \nIdk what her parents are telling her. I really don't know a lot of things. And thinking about it just hurts my head too much :(", "That sister weaponized her own children against OP first and foremost. That\u2019s the biggest AH move if I\u2019ve ever seen one.", "how is op the asshole . the sister made it very clear she didn't want op to have a relationship with her kids. and so what now that she actually needs op instead of apologizing she demands op take care of the very kids she refused op of having a relationship with. op is nta.", "Correct about me not being attached to Frey. Initially I was in a different state for an year and then my sister just started with this weird behaviour that made me feel like that she wouldn't let me talk to them or I wouldn't have a relationship with them if I didn't do, say or behave a certain way. \nWhen I was younger I did give in to a lot of it and then I realized some of these unspoken 'conditions' were just unfair and not worth all the mental agony.\nSo I really don't want to reconnect. Because I just don't want to. Is it necessary to give up your comfort and peace to be a good person? \nAnd I just want to have a simple special occasion  hello/hi worthy relationship with them. No weapons, there's nothing I have to win here. Only to lose", "Well if it\u2019s going to end in an argument and more frustration for you then I wouldn\u2019t explain yourself.", "Can you be her friend on social media? Just stay in touch and be friendly so she knows you're not against her.", "Where does the OP say that the sister has \"made it very clear she doesn't want OP to have a relationship with her kids\"?  Nothing has been stated to that effect. All we have is the OPs interpretation based on regularity of visits. The sister may not think there is anything to apologise for. \n\nRegardless, I was not saying OP was being an asshole to her sister, I said she was being an asshole to her nieces. And I stand by that.", "Yeah. That I can do. She doesn't have one yet. But when she does,  yeah", "NTA here but it\u2019s sad for your nieces that they don\u2019t get to have that relationship with you. I\u2019d fight for that personally but no judgement whatsoever if you\u2019re over it.", "Could have been that your sister was jealous of your relationship with Abby and felt threatened as her mother.  NTA. But this is very sad for you and Abby if that is the case.", "Agreed. It\u2019s great when siblings are friends, but that is a choice and work to maintain. \n\nAlso, I love that it\u2019s not just the kids either, but also an old lady unrelated to OP.  Like who would want to do that?", "Found the sister!", "Yeah, that alone would be a hard pass for me. There are plenty of fun things you can do with a 14 and 6 year old, but if someone is too decrepit to take care of themselves for a week is thrown into the mix, the dynamic completely changes."]}
