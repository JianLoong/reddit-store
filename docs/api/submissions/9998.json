She has had Riley for 8 years now and it brought her tons of happiness. The issue is I am allergic to cats...like super allergic. I develop hives, I start coughing, and I get these really watery eyes. I didn't know this was a problem before we moved in as, while we were dating, she used to just come over to my apartment as it was close to both the school she started work at and my university (I am in medical school). I would occasionally get watery eyes when she was around, but I always just chalked it up to pollen as it was never severe enough to care. Now though it is getting to an extreme level.\n\nThat being said, I know how much she loves Riley so I tried to find the best homes I could that would take her in. All of them are either people we know or people who have a lot of experience with cats. I made a list and then I told my girlfriend the problem. When I asked her to possibly give away Riley, she said she wasn't giving away Riley to an animal shelter. I said of course I would never make her do that, and that's when I showed her the list with all the families.\n\nI proposed this to her and that's when she just lost it at me. I don't know what I did wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\n**All Edits (condensed due to character-limit):**\n\n\\- I've tried a variety of medications, none of them have worked for a sustainable period of time. Others have been out of my budget to be effective sustainably.\n\n\\- Also, we both wanted to move in-together. I just asked her to move into my apartment instead as it was more spacious.\n\n\\- I did not know I was allergic to cats before she moved in. I got tested recently, after I got all these symptoms, and found out I was allergic to cats.\n\n\\- I've been to her house, and yes I developed symptoms (they were much much milder mind you). I just didn't care enough because they were so mild.\n\n\\- As for the list, I just wanted to make sure Riley was safe as she is an old cat. I realize now this may have been a bad idea as it cornered my gf into a corner. That was not my intention. I did not intend to do that, I just wanted to give her options.\n\n\\- I think the best suggestion was making some \"no-go zones\" for the cat. Like not having the cat allowed in the bedroom or the office. Not allowing the cat on my chair. Plus air-purifiers and etc.\n\n\\- Also, y'all are treating me like a doctor. This is my first year in medical school. I am not a doctor. Like I have just gotten in and I've been in medical school for maybe 5 months. Cut me some slack.\n\n\\- Some of you have found out my real-identity and are now sending me messages on my instagram. I get this is a very heated topic for some of you but please don't do that. I would like to keep this conversation on my reddit account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1676441641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112r6aq/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_give_away_her_cat/", "score": 271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You counted your chickens before they hatched. \n\nTo her it may have sounded more like a command rather than an actual ask. Or at least was upset that you would even suggest rehoming the cat in general after having it for so long.\n\nTBH if she has been aware of your allergies for a while and hasn\u2019t already suggested re-homing then I doubt she\u2019ll consider it. Especially since she\u2019s had the cat for 8 years, meaning that she\u2019s both had the cat in her life longer then you and the cat is also getting up there in age.", "INFO: When you say you made a list - so had you discussed this with the people on the list? Because I would not be happy that my boyfriend discussed the possibility of rehoming my cat with a list of other people before raising the issue with me. \nAnd if you didn't discuss it with them the list is pretty meaningless because how do you know they are able/willing to take in the cat?", "no offense but i'm pretty sure she'd rather keep the cat", "YTA. You should never ask someone with a pet to just get rid of it like that. Pets become people's family. Go back to living seperately and see a specialist about your allergies.", "YTA\n\nThe cat has been longer in her life than you have. \nHow comes you didn\u2018t know about the allergy before you moved in? Why haven\u2018t you spent a few days at her place before? It seems like you won\u2018t be moving in together yet because you do not rehome a family member. \n\n(And most people would dump their partners right away if they ever suggested to get rid of their pets. Truth be told, I\u2018ve always asked about cat allergies before dating and it was a dealbreaker for me  because my cat belongs to me ^^\u2018 )", "YTA. You decided to try to find a home for Riley BEFORE even asking your GF. That\u2019s nervy. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re allergic but don\u2019t be surprised if she chooses Riley.", "YTA. Your girlfriend needs to find someone to take you in. Not a shelter, obviously, but some kind friends.", "How have you tried every medicine under the sun if you just now found out you were allergic to the cat. Also who the eff makes plans to rehome someone\u2019s animal without discussing it with them FIRST. You already had a list of people before even having the conversation. If this is how you handle problems in your relationship, deciding before hand and then telling someone what you decided you will always be an AH. And hopefully single", "Yes, YTA. \nThis proposal of getting rid of her cat is not okay. \nThis cat was in her life longer than you were. \n\nThe best option is getting back to living separately. \nBest for your health and her well-being. \nAnd look into therapy options for your allergy. There are ways to lessen the effect and medications that can help as well.\n\nLooking at your edit: \nYou will have to live separately then, if meds don't work. \nYou can move in with each other once the cat has died, if you're still together at that time.", "So you find yourself in this unfortunate situation and rather than sitting down with your partner and saying \u201cI love you, I love Riley, but I am seriously struggling with these severe cat allergies.   Can we talk about strategies and possible options together ?\u201d YOUR big idea was to present her a list of families/homes for her to abruptly rehome her beloved pet with zero notice or discussion??\n\nSERIOUSLY?!\n\nDude.  YTA.   And I suspect the cat will not be a problem for much longer.  Neither will the girlfriend.  Not because of your allergy; because she won\u2019t forgive or forget this unforgivably heartless and unkind move you just made.   \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yta go get the shots. And don't be surprised if she takes her cat and moves out.", "I\u2019m not even talking about the allergies, YTA for asking people if they would take her beloved cat before discussing it with her", "NAH.\n\nUnfortunately, this may spell the death of your relationship.  It's not fair to you to have to live in an extremely allergic environment (which will only get worse the more the pet dander seeps into everything).  And it's not fair to her to have tto give up a beloved cat.  You are gonna have to sit her down and say the relationship can't continue like this.  It's not that you want to, it's that you have to.", "YTA for the sheer fact you did not bring this up to her. Instead, you went behind her back to find a home for Riley with the assumption Riley would be leaving with no compromise or input from your girlfriend. How awful and clueless can you be?!?! You didn\u2019t bring anything up to her do you BOTH could tackle this together. Honestly, if my partner did what you did, I would leave. What other things will you do behind her back?", "YTA - you didn\u2019t ask her, you pretty much told her she had to give her beloved cat up!

The way you describe it you immediately told her she has to get rid of the cat. You didn\u2019t give her any time to process things. \n\nOf course she is upset. You just told her that she has a choice to make but you took that choice away from her by giving her a list of places to get rid of the cat. \n\nYou did the Dr thing. Here is what is wrong and here is how we are going to treat it. That works pretty well with medicine not for relationships.", "YTA - For expecting someone to just get rid of a family member after 8 years of love and bonding. That would be a deal breaker for me.", "YTA and the amount of people saying N A H is so bizarre. How selfish do you have to be to not only presume that your girlfriend would be willing to give up her cat of 8 years for you, but go as far as trying to find a home for her?? And to top it all off you \u201cdon\u2019t know what you did wrong\u201d? Unbelievable.", "INFO: Have you tried prescription-strength antihistamines? Or would you be willing to do allergy shots?", "YTA ! She\u2019s had the cat for 8 years and you for 2 \u2026 as a cat  mom you couldn\u2019t pay me all the money in the world to get rid of him . She should move back out keep cat and I guess you as well if she must \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA!! That cat has been a part of her family for 8 years. In comparison you are a blip on the radar. Never, ever ask someone to give up a pet. It is selfish and disrespectful. If you can\u2019t handle the cat, break things off with her. They are a package deal. And let future girls you date know that you don\u2019t care for pets.", "How did you never realize this when visiting her if you are 2 years into the relationship? NAH obviously this is a crappy situation all around It's fine to ask her if rehoming is a possibility, but this has been her cat for longer than you've been her boyfriend that's a big ask. You could try for now keeping the cat in one room, and seeing if allergy meds work for you.", "YTA. Riley is a living thing she has loved longer than she's even known you. \n\nPS I'm severely allergic to cats and married a woman who adores them. You have not tried everything.\n\n1. Cats have this oil thing on their skin that causes the issues. If the cat is bathed or even baby wiped regularly, that helps sooo much. Cats can take baths and should, just like dogs. Ours is bathed every 3 days.\n2. What makes cats allergic is actually something in their genes. There's food you can give the cat that stops that. Since switching the cat to that, my eyes have not swollen shut once. \n3. I pop a Claritin in the morning and telfast on occasion. No problems. I even cuddle the damn thing now.\n\nTry harder or end up single.", "NAH - but you need to work on the communication. You don\u2019t go around asking people to take in your girlfriends cat when you haven\u2019t even had that conversation with your girlfriend. You\u2019re a partnership, a team. You tackle these issues together, not as a party of one. \n\nUnfortunately, you guys may simply not be compatible. She has to decide if she\u2019s willing to give up her cat or not, and you have to decide if you\u2019re willing to live with your allergies for the next 7-10+ years.\n\nAnd I believe you on the allergies - my partner is allergic to everything under the sun so if he ever develops a new allergy we\u2019d have a pretty hard time figuring out it was A) new and B) what was actually triggering it.", "YTA.  I know this sounds harsh. But you dated a girl long enough to decide to move on together, and didn\u2019t know she had a cast?  Or, you\u2019re a medical student who only just discovered you have a cat allergy?  YTA because you didn\u2019t plan this move in well.  You were actually surprised she showed up with her cat?  She needs to move back to her own place and you to hours.  Check and see if you can pursue treatment for your cat allergy ( faculty will help you!) and if you can manage living with a cat with treatment and keeping it out of your bedroom.  Slow things down and see what if you can live with a cat.  People and their pets are package deals.  This may sadly turn out to be a deal breaker.  Alternately, you may find with treatment and waiting until you can get a bigger place that the cat can leave you a few rooms to retreat to when needed, say bedroom and study. If this gal is your person, see what YOU can do.", "You presented her with a solution. In a mature relationship you\u2019d come to her to discuss the problem and develop a solution together.\n\nAs an aside, I\u2019d probably choose my cat over someone I was dating. When I took guardianship of my cat, I made a commitment to look after it for life.", "Even at the end of the post after she\u2019s said no he phrases it like it a done deal that the cat is going. TA", "YTA, I hope the gf choose to keep the cat over Op", "Bro - YTA. You certainly have not tried everything. There is allergen reducing food that her cat can eat. You can try allergy injections. Surely, as a medical student, you would have been exposed to that.\n\nMy wife is also heavily allergic to cats and we now have a cat thanks to her ACTUALLY trying everything. I had come to terms with never owning another cat to help with her allergies, but she surprised me.", "I'm sorry but you really never went over to her house or met her cat once in 2 years?? You knew you were allergic so YTA.\n\nIf you were really serious about this relationship and wanting to eventually move in with her you would have voiced this concern or met the cat before now. Instead you just ambushed her.", "YTA specifically for thinking your two year relationship is more important than her relationship with her cat lol.", "NAH. I can understand you not wanting to be around an animal you're allergic to, it's fair to not want those symptoms triggered, and you looking into homes for Riley that are people who you know would look after him shows thought and care. But at the same time, you don't usually have a pet for eight years and not love them and consider them part of your family, and she doesn't want to give him away to anyone because she wants him with her.\n\nIt's a very unfortunate situation but both your stances are understandable. Probably worth having a proper discussion about.", "NAH. You have the right to ask her being angry at the suggestion is reasonable.  You are making her choose between two things she loves.  You may or may not win.  She\u2019ll also resent you forever if you go through with it even if she agrees today.", "NAH other than the terrible communication (throwing too much at her at once, making it obvious that you'd planned the \"giving the cat away\" conversation before even letting her know it was an issue).  It's not OP's fault he is allergic to cats.  If there's absolutely no way he can live with the cat (have you tried keeping it out of the bedroom, getting air purifiers, etc.?)  then they need to have a serious conversation about their options -- and there aren't any great ones.", "YTA. You came up with a whole plan before you asked if she was willing to rehome her pet. This is an animal that she has bonded with for 8 years. That is 4 times the amount of time she has bonded with you. \n\nWhy did you think that she would immediately agree to any plan you made?", "NAH, but she'll have to decide which is more important to her - you or her cat. It's a cruel choice, I know, but given that your health and quality of life seems to be severely compromised in the cat's presence, its clear the present living arrangement isn't sustainable.", "INFO: how did she live in a \u201ctiny studio\u201d and yet had roommates?", "NAH. I understand your position as I have the same reaction to cats. I learned it when I was cat sitting for a friend. \n\nI assume you could get shots from an allergist.   It\u2019s a big ask to ask your girlfriend to get rid of her cat.", "Change cat with child and see how it plays out. \u201cWill you get rid of your child but dw I have curated a list of loving families for them\u201d. Not saying cats are equivalent to children (cats are obviously better) but they\u2019re still family, they aren\u2019t a disposable item. YTA", "NTAH but an AH communicator.\n\nYou gave her too much at one time.  Introduce allergies in conversation one.  The giving away of the beloved pet in conversation two and the list in three.  You did all 3 at once and didn't give her time to process.", "I mean, I kinda feel like YTA for making a list of people to give her cat too. First steps to me would be meds (doctor), air purifier, cleaning, not letting cat in bedroom. \n\nThis is one of the reasons that when my partner and I considered moving in together, we moved my cats first in first. That way if things didn't work out for whatever reason, I would have just gone back to my own place. And if they had given a list of people to rehome my cats to? Duck them", "YTA I am allergic to cats too. You cannot expect her to abandon something she has loved for years for a shorter relationship. Either yoy wait till the cat has had a full life or have a designated cat room that you don't go in, she keeps spotless and she washes and changes clothes after using it.\n\nAnd to come up with a list of homes she can abandon her family member to without even discussing it with her. You don't deserve a partner.\n\nI hope you don't develop allergies to any future kids you might have.", "NTA. I\u2019m also allergic to cats and each time I\u2019m staying at my family house with 2 cats, I\u2019m in a survival mode. Even though I love animals.\n\nThe situation sucks, but your girlfriend has to make a choice, unfortunately.", "NAH.  You could've talked about it with her instead of finding homes without her. That's soft y t a. You didn't know it was her pet making you ill before the move in. \n\nIf she does decide to give up kitty. Will it be because she loves you or because she hates her old living situation? The possibility of resentment is huge.\n\nAnd is she willing to commit to never having a cat again for the duration of your lives together? Tough ask for someone you barely know. \n\nFor future reference. You would be T A if you get involved with another cat owner. You already know you would have to ask them to rehome their pet. Please don't do that.", "Clerify- you decided to move in together knowing you were allergic to cats? And this wasn't addressed beforehand?", "Yes.", "NTA but you definitely should not have went into this conversation assuming she would pick you over the cat.", "NAH I think your situation is understandable but so is hers. A new sudden diagnosis of an allergy with symptoms that disturb your everyday life can be an issue. \n\nHowever, not communicating to her as soon as you had realised it was a big issue made the situation harder for her. Her being upset is valid due to the confrontation of making a decision.\n\nI do know that in some cases humans allergic to cats can gain immunity to the specific cats in their home but you should speak to your doctor abouet the options available if you do want to maintain the relationship unless she is willing to compromise with you.\n\nIt's a tough situation you are in.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA for the idea of rehoming the cat as you living with it doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea. But this feels like an A for idea F for execution sort of situation. Like you\u2019re NTA for having the allergies and taking the next logical step for you which is, \u201cremove the allergen\u201d but this isn\u2019t just like a food or something, this is a living being she has an emotional connection to, and for that reason 0 planning should have happened at all until you spoke to her about it. It comes across as if you\u2019ve got no care for her emotions involved, sort of like you just showed up and said, \u201chey your cat\u2019s gotta go, here\u2019s where it\u2019s going, say bye.\u201d", "NTA but she's had that cat longer than she's been with you.

The crux of it is - you really cannot live with a cat. She should move out with a cat until y'all decide if this relationship is going to go the distance, and if it is, your needs need to matter more than the cat, because as much as she loves the animal she should love you more if you're going to stay together for the long term. And if you two don't want to make that commitment, she shouldn't be giving away the cat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You cannot live like this with the constant triggers, and Riley\u2019s likelihood of being rehomed is small and your girlfriend\u2019s feelings are important too. By showing her the list of people who you had already spoken to about adopting her cat it probably looked like you were forcing her hand. Let her come to the idea herself. And it may also come to it that she chooses her cat over you.\n\nI never had cats growing up so I had no idea I was allergic to cats until I was a teenager and spent the night at a friend\u2019s house. Her cat was fascinated with me and slept on my sleeping bag with me and I felt so ill after a night of breathing in cat hair.

It\u2019s not like you were against her bringing the cat from the beginning. \n\nYour communication sucks though. You for sure ambushed her. It\u2019s been her pet for 8 years! How can you think she was going to be in board with rehoming the cat at all, let alone coming to her with a list of new homes ready to go at your first conversation post allergy diagnosis- as if it was just a given she would give the cat up?!\n\nI don\u2019t really have advice/guidance for you with this one. It\u2019s a tough situation. You need to prepare yourself for one of the following: loosing her (she chooses the cat), her resenting you forever (she chooses you), of start budgeting for allergy shots (that cat stays and you go more formal medical care for the allergy)", "Allergy tip: \n\nThere are more medications than you can dream of. If you only recently knew of your allergen to cats, then you haven't tried everything because you can actually get allergy injections to subject your system to your allergens to build up a tolerance. I used to be severely allergic and through exposure my body tolerates them better. I have also been on a combination of 3/4 allergy medications for years, so things to help.", "YTA for making the list and the decision without telling her. That was underhand.", "Soft YTA. You can't go getting rid of someone's pet. \n\nYou're not compatible at this time and need to live separately again.\n\nAlso, the shots take a long time to work - like months to a year.

There\u2019s a strong bond there. Your list of friends could be useful later for people to check in on her if you guys go out of town, for instance. Cat-friends. Hey, there\u2019s somethin.\n\nYou guys should talk about mitigating the pet dander\u2014-well, apologize first\u2014 as much as you can with the air filters/safe area, pet vacuum, brushing often.. your 2nd edit refers to allergy shots?.. etc.\u2014just don\u2019t obsess and let it consume you or your entire relationship, make a strong earnest good-faith effort.

That said, many tell you to live with the cat but I recommend talking to your doctor about that because you describe a pretty severe case and while some loose the sensitivity to their allergen, other cases will worsen.

The thing people who don't have allergies don't understand is allergies aren't a choice, not a life decision, they just happen out of our control and there usually isn't a whole lot we can do about them. The allergy injections take YEARS to MAYBE work. OTC meds only work for a while, and alot of time not on pet allergies (not mention the horrible side effects).

For that reason I'm going with NAH here.\n\nFor those saying to get injections, I literally had a year of weekly injections and another two of monthly. It certainly helps, but doesn't make the allergy go away. It just takes it from severe to moderate and is no magic bullet. Allergies really suck and can be hugely detrimental to your health and mental wellbeing.\n\nYou and your partner need to sit down and have a heart to heart and work this out yourselves. It doesn't look like anyone wins in this situation, unfortunately.", "NTA\n\nI really feel for you because I just spent all day in the office of an allergy doctor because my nephew (whom I was escorting for the day) is so horribly allergic to cats.  He gets hives, his eyes get so swollen that he develops clogged tear ducts, he has major sinus problems... It gets really bad for him. His family has currently limited their cats to only one part of the house. And they clean fanatically. But it is still making him sick. And so they still might have to get rid of the cats eventually.\n\nBecause, the truth is that allergy treatment, while extremely effective, is not always a cure-all. That's especially true if the allergy is particularly severe. Sometimes, allergy shots simply make it so that you can have casual brushes with your particular allergen without breaking out into hives. (E.g.,  sitting next to somebody who has cat hair all over their sweater.) It doesn't necessarily guarantee that you can function with perpetual contact to the allergen (e.g., living with a cat).\n\nYour situation sucks and there's no perfect answer. It really is going to boil down to whether your relationship is far enough advanced that she would rather give up her cat than you. And that's not a fair decision to dump on anybody, but this is nobody's fault.\n\nMy great-grandmother and great-grandfather hated each other for the last few decades of their marriage because she had a million cats and he hated them. He did not have an allergy. But the bottom line was that he felt like she loved her cats more than him. And she felt like he hated cats more than he wished for her happiness. Each of them felt unloved and uncherished.\n\nI say this simply as a warning. It's better to make some hard decisions now, rather than forcing an unhappy decision that's going to build up resentment between the two of you beneath the surface.", "YTA, yea sure you tried to take medications but you actively tried to remove her pet as a solution and for that YTA.\n\nSide note, I'm actually surprised that you had \"mild\" symptoms at her place and never pieced it together or even tried to make rational sense of a reaction of that magnitude. And for everyone saying NTA has clearly never had a family pet that they bonded with. And lastly \"its not his fault he's allergic\" is equivalent to \"it's not the cats fault he's allergic\"", "NAH - You are in a no-win situation. The cat is making you physically ill and you are trying to come up with solutions. There probably was no good way to bring it up. \n\nI absolutely adore my cats and cuddling with them is the best part of my day. However, if they caused my partner or child to be physically ill and we tried everything possible to prevent it, I would look into having a family member adopt my cats (so I could still see them). \n\nIn general, humans need to come before pets. Pets are not our children, though we do love them immensely. When life changes, our commitment is to make sure our pets are happy and healthy. Hopefully, that is with us, but it may be with someone else. \n\nI've kept all of my pets until they've passed on, but am a realist and know life can throw you a loop sometimes. So those hating on OP really need to get some perspective.", "Can you ask her to move out then in order for your health to get better?

I've had hives from allergic reactions and nothing I took made them go away, it reduced the itching, but each time it's taken at least 4 days for them to go away, and this was just with one off exposure, not continual exposure.  Hives all over your body aren't an enjoyable experience.  \n\nSounds like your gf is going to have to move out.  She cannot reasonably expect her cat to stay in your apartment when nothing helps with the allergy.

He took allergy medication when necessary and slowly the allergies went away. There are wipes to help with the dander, certain foods to put cats on as well. It may be best for you both to have separate places again. I personally would rehome my husband before I would rehome my cat.", "I think the strategy is bad enough to call for YTA.  Your girlfriend had no involvement in the development of your ideas to address the problem. She owns your allergies as much as you do. Why is she not only being left out of the discussion, but asked to make the greater sacrifice?", "YTA and the kinda of doctor that scares me. I really hope you are going to study not work on patients.\n\nIf you do X (go to her house) and every time experience allergy symptoms and do not develop a theory as to why then you are even a bigger AH.

He made plans to do it, and then told her.", "Also called the cat \u2018it\u2019. Just sad", "Why do these AHs move in with people with pets? He must have known he was allergic after two years of dating his girlfriend.", "My cat is my baby, honestly I would immediately leave anyone who wanted me to get rid of him. That cat has been my friend when I didn't have any and has taught me more about life and myself than most people. I would do anything for him", "Okay I mean you probably don't tell your partner to get rid of their pet, but at some point you have to have the discussion right? If living with the animal is going to make you miserable and giving up the animal is going to make them miserable, it's possible you've discovered a fundamental incompatibility? So like yeah. At some point a conversation is going to have to happen about whether the relationship is more important or the pet is. Either answer is okay, but you have to have the conversation and act on the results.", "I have been to her home. When I did spend time there I did develop my allergies but I just thought it was something else. It was never this extreme because I had never been exposed to the cat for such long periods of time. She also had a roommate, who was kind of awful to her, and she was in the midst of trying to find new housing, which is why she was always at my place. \n\nIts getting worse the longer I stay in the house with the cat however, which is the issue.", "yeah i get that intent to show you care to do the research but still it shows badly as the problem should have been discussed first", "Love this!", "To be fair to me, the exact words I said were :\n\n\"Lindsey \\[(fake name)\\], my allergies are getting really really bad.
