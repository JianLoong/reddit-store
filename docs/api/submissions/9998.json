{"id": 9998, "submission_id": "112r6aq", "title": "AITA for asking my girlfriend to give away her cat?", "selftext": "# Original:\n\nTo give some background, my girlfriend (f23) and I (m24) have been dating for almost 2 years and I asked her to move-in to my apartment (its much larger than her's, so it made sense).\n\nHaving decided to move-in she brought her cat, Riley, with her. She has had Riley for 8 years now and it brought her tons of happiness. The issue is I am allergic to cats...like super allergic. I develop hives, I start coughing, and I get these really watery eyes. I didn't know this was a problem before we moved in as, while we were dating, she used to just come over to my apartment as it was close to both the school she started work at and my university (I am in medical school). I would occasionally get watery eyes when she was around, but I always just chalked it up to pollen as it was never severe enough to care. Now though it is getting to an extreme level.\n\nThat being said, I know how much she loves Riley so I tried to find the best homes I could that would take her in. All of them are either people we know or people who have a lot of experience with cats. I made a list and then I told my girlfriend the problem. When I asked her to possibly give away Riley, she said she wasn't giving away Riley to an animal shelter. I said of course I would never make her do that, and that's when I showed her the list with all the families.\n\nI proposed this to her and that's when she just lost it at me. I don't know what I did wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\n# Old Edits (condensed due to character-limit):\n\n\\- I've tried a variety of medications, none of them have worked for a sustainable period of time. Others have been out of my budget to be effective sustainably.\n\n\\- Also, we both wanted to move in-together. I just asked her to move into my apartment instead as it was more spacious.\n\n\\- I did not know I was allergic to cats before she moved in. I got tested recently, after I got all these symptoms, and found out I was allergic to cats.\n\n\\- I've been to her house, and yes I developed symptoms (they were much much milder mind you). I just didn't care enough because they were so mild.\n\n\\- As for the list, I just wanted to make sure Riley was safe as she is an old cat. I realize now this may have been a bad idea as it cornered my gf into a corner. That was not my intention. I did not intend to do that, I just wanted to give her options.\n\n\\- I think the best suggestion was making some \"no-go zones\" for the cat. Like not having the cat allowed in the bedroom or the office. Not allowing the cat on my chair. Plus air-purifiers and etc.\n\n\\- Also, y'all are treating me like a doctor. This is my first year in medical school. I am not a doctor. Like I have just gotten in and I've been in medical school for maybe 5 months. Cut me some slack.\n\n\\- Some of you have found out my real-identity and are now sending me messages on my instagram. I get this is a very heated topic for some of you but please don't do that. I would like to keep this conversation on my reddit account.\n\n**- I have tried the allergy shots. They don't work that well for me and I cannot afford them as a long-term solution.**\n\n# New Edits:\n\n\\- There are a lot of people telling me to just breakup with her. I do love her, but maybe if this isn't something we can get past then maybe we should consider a breakup. I feel as though she doesn't care how deeply troubling this has been for me. Like I can't breathe in my own home. I can barely sleep and it feels suffocating. The issue is, if I do breakup, she would have to go back to her studio apartment where she lives with other people, that had become a toxic environment for her. She was in the situation before I met her, and she had been looking for a way out but she couldn't afford better housing. I also pay for this apartment on my own, so a sudden break-up would put a lot of financial burden on her. So, to ask, do I try to make this work? Or do I breakup? Also, if I do breakup, how do I do it ethically?", "created_utc": 1676441641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112r6aq/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_give_away_her_cat/", "score": 1803, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because I would not be happy that my boyfriend discussed the possibility of rehoming my cat with a list of other people before raising the issue with me. \nAnd if you didn't discuss it with them the list is pretty meaningless because how do you know they are able/willing to take in the cat?", "no offense but i'm pretty sure she'd rather keep the cat", "YTA. You should never ask someone with a pet to just get rid of it like that. Pets become people's family. Go back to living seperately and see a specialist about your allergies.", "YTA\n\nThe cat has been longer in her life than you have. \nHow comes you didn\u2018t know about the allergy before you moved in? Why haven\u2018t you spent a few days at her place before? It seems like you won\u2018t be moving in together yet because you do not rehome a family member. \n\n(And most people would dump their partners right away if they ever suggested to get rid of their pets.

Your girlfriend needs to find someone to take you in. Not a shelter, obviously, but some kind friends.", "How have you tried every medicine under the sun if you just now found out you were allergic to the cat. Also who the eff makes plans to rehome someone\u2019s animal without discussing it with them FIRST. You already had a list of people before even having the conversation. If this is how you handle problems in your relationship, deciding before hand and then telling someone what you decided you will always be an AH. And hopefully single", "Yes, YTA. \nThis proposal of getting rid of her cat is not okay. \nThis cat was in her life longer than you were. \n\nThe best option is getting back to living separately. \nBest for your health and her well-being. \nAnd look into therapy options for your allergy. There are ways to lessen the effect and medications that can help as well.\n\nLooking at your edit: \nYou will have to live separately then, if meds don't work. \nYou can move in with each other once the cat has died, if you're still together at that time.", "So you find yourself in this unfortunate situation and rather than sitting down with your partner and saying \u201cI love you, I love Riley, but I am seriously struggling with these severe cat allergies.

YTA.   And I suspect the cat will not be a problem for much longer.  Neither will the girlfriend.

It's not that you want to, it's that you have to.", "YTA for the sheer fact you did not bring this up to her. Instead, you went behind her back to find a home for Riley with the assumption Riley would be leaving with no compromise or input from your girlfriend. How awful and clueless can you be?!?! You didn\u2019t bring anything up to her do you BOTH could tackle this together. Honestly, if my partner did what you did, I would leave. What other things will you do behind her back?", "YTA - you didn\u2019t ask her, you pretty much told her she had to give her beloved cat up!

You just told her that she has a choice to make but you took that choice away from her by giving her a list of places to get rid of the cat. \n\nYou did the Dr thing.

That works pretty well with medicine not for relationships.", "YTA - For expecting someone to just get rid of a family member after 8 years of love and bonding. That would be a deal breaker for me.", "YTA and the amount of people saying N A H is so bizarre. How selfish do you have to be to not only presume that your girlfriend would be willing to give up her cat of 8 years for you, but go as far as trying to find a home for her?? And to top it all off you \u201cdon\u2019t know what you did wrong\u201d? Unbelievable.", "INFO: Have you tried prescription-strength antihistamines? Or would you be willing to do allergy shots?", "YTA ! She\u2019s had the cat for 8 years and you for 2 \u2026 as a cat  mom you couldn\u2019t pay me all the money in the world to get rid of him .

In comparison you are a blip on the radar. Never, ever ask someone to give up a pet. It is selfish and disrespectful. If you can\u2019t handle the cat, break things off with her. They are a package deal. And let future girls you date know that you don\u2019t care for pets.", "How did you never realize this when visiting her if you are 2 years into the relationship? NAH obviously this is a crappy situation all around It's fine to ask her if rehoming is a possibility, but this has been her cat for longer than you've been her boyfriend that's a big ask. You could try for now keeping the cat in one room, and seeing if allergy meds work for you.", "YTA. Riley is a living thing she has loved longer than she's even known you. \n\nPS I'm severely allergic to cats and married a woman who adores them. You have not tried everything.\n\n1. Cats have this oil thing on their skin that causes the issues. If the cat is bathed or even baby wiped regularly, that helps sooo much. Cats can take baths and should, just like dogs. Ours is bathed every 3 days.\n2. What makes cats allergic is actually something in their genes. There's food you can give the cat that stops that. Since switching the cat to that, my eyes have not swollen shut once. \n3. I pop a Claritin in the morning and telfast on occasion. No problems. I even cuddle the damn thing now.\n\nTry harder or end up single.", "NAH - but you need to work on the communication. You don\u2019t go around asking people to take in your girlfriends cat when you haven\u2019t even had that conversation with your girlfriend. You\u2019re a partnership, a team. You tackle these issues together, not as a party of one. \n\nUnfortunately, you guys may simply not be compatible. She has to decide if she\u2019s willing to give up her cat or not, and you have to decide if you\u2019re willing to live with your allergies for the next 7-10+ years.\n\nAnd I believe you on the allergies - my partner is allergic to everything under the sun so if he ever develops a new allergy we\u2019d have a pretty hard time figuring out it was A) new and B) what was actually triggering it.", "YTA.  I know this sounds harsh. But you dated a girl long enough to decide to move on together, and didn\u2019t know she had a cast?  Or, you\u2019re a medical student who only just discovered you have a cat allergy?  YTA because you didn\u2019t plan this move in well.  You were actually surprised she showed up with her cat?  She needs to move back to her own place and you to hours.  Check and see if you can pursue treatment for your cat allergy ( faculty will help you!) and if you can manage living with a cat with treatment and keeping it out of your bedroom.  Slow things down and see what if you can live with a cat.  People and their pets are package deals.  This may sadly turn out to be a deal breaker.  Alternately, you may find with treatment and waiting until you can get a bigger place that the cat can leave you a few rooms to retreat to when needed, say bedroom and study. If this gal is your person, see what YOU can do.", "You presented her with a solution. In a mature relationship you\u2019d come to her to discuss the problem and develop a solution together.\n\nAs an aside, I\u2019d probably choose my cat over someone I was dating.

TA", "YTA, I hope the gf choose to keep the cat over Op", "Bro - YTA. You certainly have not tried everything. There is allergen reducing food that her cat can eat. You can try allergy injections. Surely, as a medical student, you would have been exposed to that.\n\nMy wife is also heavily allergic to cats and we now have a cat thanks to her ACTUALLY trying everything. I had come to terms with never owning another cat to help with her allergies, but she surprised me.", "I'm sorry but you really never went over to her house or met her cat once in 2 years??

Instead you just ambushed her.", "YTA specifically for thinking your two year relationship is more important than her relationship with her cat lol.", "NAH. I can understand you not wanting to be around an animal you're allergic to, it's fair to not want those symptoms triggered, and you looking into homes for Riley that are people who you know would look after him shows thought and care. But at the same time, you don't usually have a pet for eight years and not love them and consider them part of your family, and she doesn't want to give him away to anyone because she wants him with her.\n\nIt's a very unfortunate situation but both your stances are understandable. Probably worth having a proper discussion about.", "NAH. You have the right to ask her being angry at the suggestion is reasonable.  You are making her choose between two things she loves.

It's not OP's fault he is allergic to cats.  If there's absolutely no way he can live with the cat (have you tried keeping it out of the bedroom, getting air purifiers, etc.?)  then they need to have a serious conversation about their options -- and there aren't any great ones.", "YTA.

First steps to me would be meds (doctor), air purifier, cleaning, not letting cat in bedroom. \n\nThis is one of the reasons that when my partner and I considered moving in together, we moved my cats first in first.

The crux of it is - you really cannot live with a cat. She should move out with a cat until y'all decide if this relationship is going to go the distance, and if it is, your needs need to matter more than the cat, because as much as she loves the animal she should love you more if you're going to stay together for the long term.

You cannot live like this with the constant triggers, and Riley\u2019s likelihood of being rehomed is small and your girlfriend\u2019s feelings are important too. By showing her the list of people who you had already spoken to about adopting her cat it probably looked like you were forcing her hand. Let her come to the idea herself. And it may also come to it that she chooses her cat over you.\n\nI never had cats growing up so I had no idea I was allergic to cats until I was a teenager and spent the night at a friend\u2019s house. Her cat was fascinated with me and slept on my sleeping bag with me and I felt so ill after a night of breathing in cat hair.

It\u2019s a tough situation. You need to prepare yourself for one of the following: loosing her (she chooses the cat), her resenting you forever (she chooses you), of start budgeting for allergy shots (that cat stays and you go more formal medical care for the allergy)", "Allergy tip: \n\nThere are more medications than you can dream of. If you only recently knew of your allergen to cats, then you haven't tried everything because you can actually get allergy injections to subject your system to your allergens to build up a tolerance.

I have also been on a combination of 3/4 allergy medications for years, so things to help.", "YTA for making the list and the decision without telling her. That was underhand.", "Soft YTA. You can't go getting rid of someone's pet. \n\nYou're not compatible at this time and need to live separately again.\n\nAlso, the shots take a long time to work - like months to a year.

His family has currently limited their cats to only one part of the house. And they clean fanatically. But it is still making him sick. And so they still might have to get rid of the cats eventually.\n\nBecause, the truth is that allergy treatment, while extremely effective, is not always a cure-all. That's especially true if the allergy is particularly severe. Sometimes, allergy shots simply make it so that you can have casual brushes with your particular allergen without breaking out into hives. (E.g.,  sitting next to somebody who has cat hair all over their sweater.) It doesn't necessarily guarantee that you can function with perpetual contact to the allergen (e.g., living with a cat).\n\nYour situation sucks and there's no perfect answer. It really is going to boil down to whether your relationship is far enough advanced that she would rather give up her cat than you. And that's not a fair decision to dump on anybody, but this is nobody's fault.\n\nMy great-grandmother and great-grandfather hated each other for the last few decades of their marriage because she had a million cats and he hated them. He did not have an allergy. But the bottom line was that he felt like she loved her cats more than him. And she felt like he hated cats more than he wished for her happiness.

You would have made her give up her companion of 8 YEARS after going behind her back, I don\u2019t care the reasoning there is always other options. A pet is a commitment for life, the cat didn\u2019t ask for this and to rehome the cat is extremely stressful for them, It has spent probably over half of its life with her.

That said, I read through some comments and can see that you accepted it was poorly handled, and you\u2019re open to trying more options to see if you can live with the cat. So instead, I\u2019ll share how I live with my two cats with severe cat allergies and hopefully some of it may be helpful to you.\n\n- for antihistamine I use fexofenadine 180mg when allergies are severe, then step down to 120mg once symptoms are more controlled. For bad days, I have been okayed by my doctor to take one tablet of an alternative antihistamine with a different active ingredient, such as ceretizine hydrochloride, loratidine, or chlorophenamine maleate. Check this with your own doctor of course, different countries have different regulations\n\n- I use nasal sprays twice daily and eye drops when needed (follow instructions ofc). Can\u2019t remember the active ingredients but both are prescribed and the eye drops in particular are very effective for me \n\n- ask your partner to help you with cleaning up floors and upholstery as I\u2019ve found vacuuming and dusting often kicks up dander and fur that could trigger a reaction. I hope you don\u2019t have carpet because they\u2019re impossible for (severe) cat allergy management \n\n- ask your partner to brush the cat from time to time. I\u2019ve seen people suggest bathing the cat once a month but I\u2019ve never done this and it would be especially hard if Riley isn\u2019t used to baths and suddenly has to get used to having them regularly at her age\n\n- air purifier: from what I understand the allergen can be airborne. Make sure you put the purifier in the opposite corner of whatever room you\u2019re staying in\n\n- no cat zones where you can go for relief if needed, bedroom is a must and depending on the size of your house maybe negotiate one other space. I\u2019d also recommend not letting the cat wander free in the kitchen for obvious reasons\n\n- try the purina pro plan live clear range if Riley eats dry food\n\n\nGood luck and hope it all works out!", "Just wanted to say that I'm sorry that you're in this situation, and judging from your edits, you did have good intentions even if the execution wasn't great.

The cat will always win", "She's had the cat for 8 years, she's known you for 2 - the cat wins. Pets are not something you just get rid of because they are inconvenient to you, it's a lifelong commitment to care for the animal.  Get some antihistamines an suck it up, or you're going to be single.", "I think you\u2019ve gotten enough judgements, so I\u2019m going to give some advice for living with a cat with allergies. The \u201cno go zones\u201d is a good idea, as well as frequently vacuuming and brushing the cat. I\u2019d also recommend using HIPA air filters in your bed room and lots of pillowcase changes. \n\nAnother option to try is giving the cat [acepromazine drops](https://www.jacksongalaxy.com/blog/cat-allergies/) daily. Acepromazine changes the chemical compozition of their saliva and removes the protein that most commonly causes cat allergies. It\u2019s not guaranteed to work, but most people who use it on their cat see at least a reduction in their allergy symptoms and some see their symptoms go away entirely. It\u2019s worth a try, talk to your GF\u2019s cat\u2019s vet about it.", "NTA\n\nHey OP I hope you see this! My SO is also very allergic to cats and other things.

I am an actual M.D. I finished Med school last year and am working towards getting my subspecialty. O.P. is absolutely right that he is being held to a ridiculous standard by STRANGERS ON THE INTERNET WHO PROBABLY HAVE VERY LITTLE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE THEMSELVES. He is  A FIRST YEAR. The amount of people who approach me knowing I'm a doctor expecting me to know everything about their disease and be able to manage it like a subspecialist would is just insane. Here's the thing. Even if O.P. was already a doctor, there are specialties for a reason. Each field has a vast expanse of knowledge and Allergology is a distinct field! And it sounds like O.P. is already seeking treatment and guidance from a specialist who knows what they're doing. You all need to stop jumping down his throat and offering him advice on how to treat HIS OWN medical condition that YOU are not informed on and HE is already seeking treatment for.  \n\n2. I adore animals, all kinds, and am borderline crazy about my dogs and my cat. They are legitimately my babies and yes, if an SO didn't like animals and wasn't willing to live with them, it would definitely be a dealbreaker. I understand! I love them so much and I would not want to part with them. That being said, that is NOT AT ALL the issue here between OP and his girlfriend. This is a new problem that arose AFTER moving in and it sounds like he is having a really shitty time. Allergies freaking suck and OPs sound very severe. If I were O.P.s girlfriend and saw my SO was having such an awful time I would have tried to address the issue BEFORE it got to this extreme where OP didn't see other options. It's not sustainable in the long term and if I wasn't willing to part with my pets, it would at the very least warrant a conversation about the future and long term compatibility, or trying to temporarily rehome the cat or SOMETHING while OP worked on getting treatment or we figured out where our relationship was headed. The fact that it doesn't seem like she was thinking about this or considering it speaks volumes to me.   \n\n3. Yes, perhaps his way of approaching the issue was a bit tactless in her eyes, but I think it's a bit sweet and I understand his mindest.

He didn't tell her point blank \"hey get rid of your cat here are your choices\". I understand her reaction in the moment because of the emotional attachment but as I said before, after that she would do best to put that aside and have a serious, mature conversation with OP about the issue.

If I gave them up for some dick, what kind of person would I be?", "They've been dating for two years and made a commitment to move in together. OP has no options other than tell GF to move out or try and rehome the cat. He suggested the option that doesn't end the relationship or force GF to pay for her own apartment again after just moving in. He went out of his way and researched how to place the cat in a caring space **if that's the route GF agreed to go.**\n\nActing like he's uncaring and cruel on a level you wouldn't be *\"comfortable\"* with is ridiculous. This is simply a relationship that cannot work out, no one is in the wrong. They're just at an impasse, there's no reason for anyone to be called an asshole here.", "Honestly I think this comes down to problem solving style. OP strikes me as a practical solutions based person- he doesn't want to ask his girlfriend to say yes to rehoming her beloved cat without providing her with viable options and all the facts. Some people might see talking to potential cat homes as underhanded but I guess it depends on your outlook.", "No, that was looking into options.", "Presenting his girlfriend with a list of homes where she can send her cat may look like he\u2019s checked out the situation so he knows that the approach is feasible.

It prevented her from participating in early stages of consideration of the problem, which for many people is key to being able to accept solutions that they don\u2019t like. And it likely made her feel railroaded \u2014 like he was trying to rush her beloved pet out the door without her being able to really think it through, because his solution was all worked out and ready to implement.\n\nPeople need to be involved in working through problems that significantly affect them.", "That is true, but so is the girlfriend for not noticing the issue and attempting to research all of the suggestions which have been made to alleviate his symptoms.", "Allergies can develop or go away at any point in your life. I wasn't allergic to cats until I was 17 or 18.

They aren't throwing a grenade then running away, they're presenting a problem and saying here are some ideas of how we can solve it. OP doing research doesn't mean girlfriend can't do research of her own, it just means he's given her some ideas to start off with.", "While I agree with you in principle, I do not agree that it applies here. More specifically, it is clear that the GF is not involved in working through the problem simply because she does not want it, not because he is preventing her.\n\nAccording both to the OP and subsequent comments, the allergies are being having an enormous negative impact on OP's health and quality of living (which took a serious toll) for a while now. OP is being harmed very significantly and it is an everyday and apparently very visible occurrence, from quite some time now. OP also already tried several therapeutic/non-therapeutic approach, and none solved the problem.\n\nIf the GF refuses to engage in a solution until now, despite seeing her boyfriend increasingly suffering from severe allergies without respite, it is on her.\n\nAnd we return to the same. Given the severity of OP's recurring symptoms, there is no alternative to getting rid of the cat from the house. The question is only if the GF stays or goes.\n\nGiven the lack of serious alternatives, I still not think that OP is an AH, by going to just one of two very bad alternatives.

I don't see an issue with having potential options available for the discussion.\n\nAnd I don't think there are many options that we have here, rehome the cat, live with the allergies, break up, or stay together and live separately.\n\nThat said, it's all about tact and how he presented these options.  I also think it would have been in his best interest to maybe have some options in mind but not present them up-front, but enter them during the discussion with her.", "He didn't make a decision though. He came up with a solution and presented it to her. It's no different than having a proposed solution at work. You do your research, state the problem, and state the solution. Then the recipient of the information will provide feedback, agree, or disagree and then come to common ground. You're so focused on saying he decided, he didn't decide anything. He came up with a proposed solution.", "Yeah OP comes off as really emotionally immature and naive.

If you can't be around pets then find someone who doesn't like pets.", "I think it needs to be a collaboration; neither present solutions immediately nor throw grenade and run off. But the need to involve the other person in the early stages to work out solutions is more important when the potential solutions are mostly bad ones. A solution someone doesn\u2019t like will be more palatable, and be less likely to be flung into the other\u2019s face down the road, if they\u2019ve owned it by being involved in the problem-solving.

I would never expect a partner of mine to live with an animal they're horribly allergic to. If they're in it for the long haul, unfortunately there is going to have to be a 'them or me' conversation. And like personally, if my partner of 2 years jumped straight to prioritising my pet over the relationship and offered to break up before  asking me to re-home my pet, I'd be questioning their commitment to the relationship. Like it is absolutely my prerogative to choose between pet and partner, but surely your partner should want to be prioritised!", "He explains how it happened. Totally reasonable story for an early 20s old. They are all idiots.", "Because an assumption was made that the cat would be rehomed instead of giving that decision fully to the person who has had their pet for 8 YEARS.

It is clear now that either the cat is rehomed or the GF needs to leave (it is his house). It should be literally visible (and audible) that this is a problem for a while now.\n\nI do not understand why people are acting as if he is robbing her of choice, when there is only two (rehome or leave), and she is not preparing to leave.", "He didn't assume it. He asked his girlfriend, and as part of his request presented options. I can see how from his perspective, he was making a request backed up with research. I can see how from his girlfriend's perspective, she felt railroaded. \n\nAnd that's great that you wouldn't give up your pets. But not everyone presumably dating to marry would have the same perspective.", "NTA. The person has a bad allergy.

I had pets all my life and I absolutely love them. But the guy suffers and did nothing more wrong than being a bit dense and ignorant, and gets attacked as if he slaughtered the cat.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend doesn\u2019t seem to give a fuck about his health. He\u2019s been wheezing and it\u2019s getting worse. Allergies can get worse and he could actually end up with his airway closing and unable to breathe. Did she clean like a freak? Did she get an air filter? Did she make sure to keep the cat away from him and limit his exposure to cat hair?\n\nWhy does she get a free pass as if his health and life don\u2019t matter?\n\nNTA.

All the comments I read were making you out to be an awful person. I get that asking your GF to give up the cat was unwise and not understanding the relationship of people to their pets, but really? Chronic allergy is awful. It is not a cold. It never ends.  OP's allergic symptoms are quite serious. He has respiratory (not just upper airway) problems - asthma. He would need many medications to control this (not cure) FOREVER! Some of the medications have side effects. It would be pills, eye drops, inhalers...just a heads up - cat dander stays in houses for 5 years after the cat has left so it's not even over.   I'm not going to advise you about your decision but commenters need some sympathy for both his symptoms and their eventual and, hopefully, mutual solution here.", "NTA. I dated a guy who had cats and I had never really had trouble with cats before. I\u2019m the least allergic in my family. If I stayed overnight at a house with a ton of cats, I\u2019d need a Benadryl but that\u2019s true of a lot of things for me. Then we moved in together and I was miserable. He had one cat, then adopted another and I tried so hard to make it work. I tried to acclimate, see an allergist, alternate Claritin, Zyrtec, and Benadryl. When I went to his parents house, they created a clean room for their cats\u2014 didn\u2019t work. (For the record, I love cats. Had posters, calendars, figurines as a kid\u2014 love them. But I can\u2019t live with them.)\n\nEventually, I moved into a nearby apartment to sleep. The relationship failed for other reasons but I learned that when you\u2019re severely allergic, there\u2019s nothing you can do except avoid the allergen.

It\u2019s miserable and I understand that you cannot live like this in your own home.\n\nBy our 40ties, our kids really really wanted cats but we couldn\u2019t bc of our allergies.  Right before COVID, we all went to a cat cafe and guess what, our allergies had gotten a lot less severe.  We have 4 cats now.  We are very fortunate that our cat allergies took the same course since we adore cats but I know for a fact that there was a point in our life where living with a cat was impossible.\n\nYou both need to break up, unfortunately.

Beyond that, allergies can worsen over time with repeat exposure, and this could develop into a serious health concern.

You're a bit of an AH with the way you went about it - deciding for her how it would be done. That's where you went wrong.\n\nIt would have been better to have a frank conversation that you cannot continue to live like you are with the source of your allergies causing you suffering, and there's a decision to be made. Fully prepare for yourself that she might just choose the cat as she's known it longer and she may think well what if we break up anyway 6 months later and then I've given my cat away for nothing.\n\nIf I were you I'd lay down the above and let her decide what she wants to do. And if I were her, I'd probably leave you. You're just not compatible sadly.", "NAH not sure why people don't take cat allergies seriously.

But your gf is also NTA for not wanting to get rid of her cat and for feeling blindsided by how you approached it.\n\nif this was like, peanuts or gluten or a food allergy and you came with suggestions for how to keep those allergens out of your house, no one would say \"try harder, live with it.\" Of course the cat is a living creature and a major part of her/anyone's life, so solutions are more painful, complicated, and personal, but your allergy is absolutely legitimate, and you shouldn't have to just deal with it.", "Have you guys tried using Allerpet?

Maybe just not live together anymore.  You want her to give up her cat? Her elderly cat?! Have you no emotion?!  Yes I sympathize with the struggles of allergies and in your own home, but how come the only way out of this for you is for *your girlfriend* to now suffer? And her cat?  Figure it the fuck out.", "I understand you're suffering, but it was pretty egotistical of you to think that she would rather live with you than with her CAT. I live with four of them, I know their deal. They train us to put their needs, wants, and comfort above our own. They do not beg for food, they demand it with howls. They assert their dominance by constantly sitting on surfaces that you deem not to be ass-appropriate. Give up her cat, you might as well be asking a Christian to give up God. Riley. IS. Her. Religion. \n\nNow you know how cat \"ownership\" works and can hopefully now understand when your girlfriend decides to \"rehome\" with her.\n\nETA: YTA.

However, I don't think you should be blamed for researching and trying to give her options, considering you cannot cohabit with the cat. I think, at this point, your relationship is questionable. You two really should consider if continuing it is feasible. I saw some suggestions of waiting until the cat dies, but that cat is 8 years old and could easily live another 10 years.

But also, I don't really think they need to break up either.  Just live separately again?  It's an honest mistake since he didn't know he was allergic.  Looking up possible new owners seems like a shitty move as a pet owner, but I think someone who's never had pets might not realize what a huge ask it was to rehome one.", "Asking doesn\u2019t make him the AH.

If he was having some symptoms he should have made the point to spend time at her apartment to see how tolerable it is and gotten the allergy testing done. He did nothing until she was in a position to have choose between having a place to live or giving up her cat. I don't think he is evil, but he showed really poor decision making and communication and that is what make him a mild YTA. \n\nNow they are in a sucky situation where he's having medical issues and she's faced with a terrible decision or trying to find a new apartment which in some markets that can be a long process. The cat could potentially live another 8-10 years so they also have to consider whether the relationship can even continue because waiting until the cat dies to move in together doesn't feel doable either.  \n\nI honestly think they will end up breaking up.

That decision would be solidified if he came up with a singular solution of rehoming the cat, and already started planning for it, before talking to me.  I get that the allergies are insufferable at this point, but you are still only thinking about yourself.  You need to start thinking about things from her perspective; if you don\u2019t, you have already proven that this is not a relationship worth continuing from her perspective.", "Yeah but kittens aren't the only thing he's allergic tho, so he assumed it was pollen... til was too frequent and intense to be just it, making him get tested. His gf also didn't think much about his hives so I think is unfair to call OP an AH over something he simply had no idea.", "It's not reasonable or mature to talk to others to take HER cat without talking to her first.  It's HER cat, and he made tentative plans for others to take it.  He had no right to talk to anyone about taking her cat without her permission. The mature and reasonable thing to do would have been to talk to her before he talked to others.", "My first thought was, does this man not know allergy shots exist? Getting rid of a pet is the absolute LAST resort, and if I was his gf, I would get rid of him before I got rid of my cat", "Oh I agree that the conversation is worth having 100%. My point was more that OP tried to just get rid of a cat that the GF has had for 8 years and is looking at it all from a logical point of view. To me it points to OP not understanding the love and affection that someone can develop for an animal, and especially one that they\u2019ve had for that long. \n\nOP and the GF should have sat down and had a serious discussion of \u201cokay look, I love you and want to live with you, but these allergies are too severe for me to live with. What should we do?\u201d Instead of trying to move ahead and rehome the cat without even consulting the GF. \n\nI\u2019m a major animal lover, but if I met someone that I thought was the love of my life but my pet made their allergies too bad, I might consider choosing the person over the pet. But not if they did what OP did.", "True, but for an 8 yo cat that doesn't have that habit or doesn't like being bathed that is an insane amount of stress. But still good to know! This exact kitty might actually be a fan of baths, who knows :)", "I have two cats that love it and try to get in the shower with me.  If we don't watch them, they will play in the toilet bowls or sinks if there's any water.", "Right? I highly doubt he's even tried injections in this short time span of events. It takes a few weeks to even hit maintenance. Allergy testing, yes.", "It's fine.  He didn't seal a deal or commit to anything - he did pre-planning.\n\nHe'd be an idiot to consider a plan, without checking to see if it would actually be possible.  Any actual choice was left to the owner of the cat.\n\nSeems pretty above board and reasonable to me.", "He looked for safe and loving homes himself and avoided shelters. He did research to try and help the cat be put in the best possible situation afterwards. Nowhere indicates any malicious intent to me", "I tried allergy shots. I just can't afford them for long enough periods of time.", "He says he can't afford them, so what would the point of trying them be?", "If all these people got to know their doctors on a personal level, they'd have to find new doctors. You're allergic to cats and didn't know it.. bad doctor.  Lol", "Have you talked to your gf about that? She may be willing to help with the cost.", "Wow that's hella expensive! I'd thought it was something in eggs that neutralized the protein so basically it had an egg glaze on the kibble. Still pricey for something so mundane", "Because he says he's tried them. Just say the cost is too much, no need to lie. Puts the whole post into question.", "He made plans to get rid of the cat, and *then* asked her.", "This isn\u2019t work though. This is someone\u2019s personal life. We\u2019re not talking about two colleagues disagreeing. We\u2019re talking about one person in the relationship coming up with a \u201csolution\u201d about the other person\u2019s pet, a whole another living being. Said living being being older than the relationship btw.\n\nHere we are talking about rehoming a whole cat. Perhaps I\u2019m an emotional person, but I would feel really uncomfortable being hit with this so-called \u201csolution\u201d out of nowhere. And on my part, I would give my better half the same courtesy and consideration. Especially when that solution literally involves rehoming as the first option, or as the post suggests, the ONLY option.\n\nIf my boyfriend decided to come up to me with a \u201csolution\u201d about my cat that involved rehoming it without even involving me in the thought process, then I wouldn\u2019t consider that a \u201csolution\u201d, I would consider that a presumptuous thought on his part. A solution that involves rehoming my cat needs to involve me. Plain and simple. Doing your research, coming up with a list behind my back and then shoving all of that in my face out of the blue doesn\u2019t appeal to me, no matter what the intentions behind it. And the very fact that OP deemed it okay to do ALL of that research, and come up with a potential list of people, who he presumably spoke to about the cat (would be additional dick move if he made assumptions about them as well)  before having spoken to his girlfriend points to the very real possibility that he pretty much assumed his girlfriend would be okay with giving away the cat. And that assumption is what he is an AH for. You don\u2019t make such huge assumptions unless you\u2019ve already decided internally that it\u2019s for the best. Perhaps OP\u2019s heart was in the right place, but the execution was flawed. In this situation it is impact over intention.\n\nThis is my personal opinion though \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f!", "I disagree. If it's something that takes weeks to be effective, it makes no sense to continue the treatment knowing all along you won't be able to do it long term", "Same I have cats and I told my partner to allergy test before we got serious which he did. I also told him that their 6 years trumps our time together and I will always choose them if he ever had the cheek to give me an ultimatum.

I would appreciate if someone said, here's the problem and here are some possible solutions, what do you think? Then we can discuss. Otherwise, if there are no proposed solutions, it's just someone complaining. The situation is his problem, he's got the allergies, so it's up to him to find a resolution they can agree upon. His GF has every right to deny and reject all his solutions, that's part of the discussion. But him putting it down on paper and saying these are some people I think would be good, if you are OK with rehoming your cat. Obviously we don't know the specifics of how the conversation went but part of discussing is coming up with solutions, whomever started it is irrelevant.", "Cattle dogs are so impressive.

In my case the allergies are just sneezing and my son is so in love with the cats I am choosing to deal with it. I think the OP looking for potential homes with people they know instead of trying to ditch the cat at a shelter showed that he was trying to come up with a plan she'll be more comfortable with.

However, OP said hes only tried \u201call the solutions\u201d in 4 months, and it takes allergy shots 6 months minimum to begin working. He said they worked when he took them, but barely was able to do it because of cost. \n\nI get it, he\u2019s a medical student and cannot afford the shots. That does not mean you do research and try to rehome an 8 year old cat who isn\u2019t even yours, but is your girlfriends.

It isn't his cat to give away, nor does it appear he knows the base needs of the cat.\n\nIf it came down to having to give up my cat because of allergies, I'd want to vet the people myself. Cats have different personalities and needs. Some cats can't live with other cats. Some cats hate children. Some cats are indoor only. And cats need time to get settled, especially a cat that has had one human for it's whole life. Moving into a new home without their person, the cat may spray or refuse to use the litter boxes or act out by clawing furniture.\n\nAnd OP probably had to ask the friends/family not to mention this to his girlfriend, or he asked HIS friends and family and not hers.
