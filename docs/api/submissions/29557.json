First she informed me that her parents ended up paying the bill themselves. She said she was just in a shitty mood yesterday while she was venting to Third Friend. I asked \u201cwhen did Landlord give the warning that it should be removed and she said \u201ca few days ago when my insurance people came to look at the yard.\u201d I asked \u201cdid Landlord give any warning over the summer about it\u201d she said \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Now I and the rest of my roommates specifically remember her saying Landlord told her to remove it in like July. So maybe she did lie about that back then. Either way she told me today that she was just being dumb and drunk. I asked if we can call this resolved now and she said yes and we shook hands.\n\nEDIT: Okay JUSTICE FOR JANE!! A lot of the comments are making Jane sound dumb or evil for wanting the garden bed removed. She is not dumb or evil.\n\nShe is stressed tf out because there is a large medical bill in her hands and she knows either she is gonna be held responsible for it (and her parents are gonna be pissed more than that already are) OR she is gonna have to find a way to have someone else be financially liable.\n\nShe asked for it to be removed before the next party, which is a reasonable thing to ask, and I did remove it. I\u2019m not trying to slander Jane. I want to know if I\u2019m the asshole. \n\nAnd some of this is me defending myself which is against the rules but I\u2019m aware of that now.\n\nOriginal: I (21F) live in a house with 4 other girls. This spring in May, I found some of those thick security glass blocks on FBMP and used them to form a raised garden bed in the backyard. \n\nFast forward to July. New girls are moving into the unit below us (we live in a duplex). According to one of my roommates, we will call her Jane (20F), when the landlord came to check up on the property around the time of the new girls\u2019 move in, the landlord told Jane that the garden bed I made should be taken down and she gave Jane a verbal warning. As of right now, I don\u2019t know if there were any other witnesses to that interaction. But I do know that I did not receive an email warning about the garden bed, we did not get a group email or text either about it. So when Jane told me \u201cthe landlord says you can\u2019t have that garden bed and gave us a warning\u201d I\u2019m like \u201coh that\u2019s dumb. If we get a fine, I\u2019ll take care of it, but until the landlord gives us a written warning or a fine, I\u2019m leaving it up.\u201d Me and Jane agreed that it\u2019s dumb that I supposedly can\u2019t have it.\n\nFast forward to September. While I\u2019m out of town, Jane hosts a party. During the party, Jane (drunk, not sure if that affects the legality of this) stands on the garden bed, falls off, and gets a cut on her leg. She goes to the ER and gets stitches.\n\nIn the following weeks she tells me how much it got in the way during the crowded backyard party and that it was a hazard. And I mean, yes. Having something that is just over ankle height on the ground while a bunch of drunk 20 year olds are dancing around it is bound to cause some falls. But how could I have considered that scenario before I made my herb garden??\n\nHer insurance is not covering the cost of her ER visit and now that she\u2019s gotten the medical bills, her parents want me to pay up since it was my garden bed.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I learned her parents want me to pay via another roommate that Jane confided in. Jane nor her parents have not actually come to me personally asking for money yet. Other roommate told me to warn me.\n\nContinuing: One might say I should pay her bills because 1. I didn\u2019t ask everyone in the house if they were okay with me having the garden bed (and why would I? I live here and the thing is three feet wide. Sorry I wasn\u2019t considering how it would interfere with the parties we\u2019re not supposed to have) and 2. Because I didn\u2019t take it down after we got the warning (which there is no written proof of).\n\nAnd I read the lease today and didn\u2019t find anything suggesting I couldn\u2019t have a garden bed. We literally have a fire pit which is against the lease. We use it all the time. If one of us were drunk and fell on the fire pit, would there be the same attitude? Or if Jane fell onto some other object that was mine. Am I at fault just because that object belongs to me?\n\nAt the end of the day she was drunk (illegal since she is 20), hosting a party in our yard (against the lease), and got hurt falling off of something that, as far as I can tell and lack proof saying otherwise, am allowed to have.\n\nAm I wrong for not removing it as soon as Jane expressed that it is a hazard? Am I wrong for planning on saying no if she asks for money? Am I wrong for not removing it after this verbal warning from the landlord that I wasn\u2019t present for and don\u2019t have proof of?", "created_utc": 1698141973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17f98sp/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_roommates_medical/", "score": 775, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wants she can sue the landlord bc it would covered under his homeowners, which they probably could argue bc she wasn\u2019t supposed to be there drunk anyway - but homeowners will prob end up paying. I dont know, but I know it\u2019s not your problem. It\u2019s even better if your landlord told your other Roommate to move it, bc it shows he knew it was there, he knew it was a hazard and he never followed up on it or said anything to you. He could have removed it himself also. Now mind you, you don\u2019t have to do anything- just bc someone says you have to pay for something, doesn\u2019t mean you do. She would have to sue you- that would be a stupid case, no lawyer would be bothered, but gather all the pictures and videos you can from that night from your friends or social media that show her looking drunk. Nobody owes money to a drunk that fell bc they were drunk. Did she damage the flower bed? You can counter sue for damages-lol", "I'd talk to a lawyer. If the bed represented a tripping hazard, normally it would be the landlord's insurance that would have to pay.

You also say she agreed with you about not taking it down, but im guessing it was more an agree to shut you up than an actual agreement.

You killed off part of the lawn for the garden.  You can't do that without approval.  You also took up yard space from the others.

More magnanimous than I might be towards someone trying to stick me with their medical bill. \n\nHowever, as a mom, a mom of a college student, and as a homeowner of a house I rent to college students - I\u2019m concerned no one learned a damn thing from this including OP.\n\nJane and OP agreed that the root of all evil garden bed should be removed from the house BEFORE THE NEXT PARTY?!?!\n\nSeriously? Did we learn nothing? OP states that at least Jane and possibly other tenants are underage. OP states that their lease doesn\u2019t allow parties. Jane already can\u2019t pay for her last boo boo and is still searching for someone to stick the bill with from her last fiasco. Good grief. \n\nOP you guys got off easy last time. You might want to think things through going forward.\n\nAs an aside- your lease probably requires renters insurance but few property owners verify it. You need it. It\u2019s not expensive and it might help you cover your asses if you keep this up. Depending on the plan it covers more than just your personal property. It can cover damages  committed against the home by renters and guests as well as medical in some cases. Why I\u2019m saying this? There\u2019s every possibility that next time someone is going to get really hurt or something gets really broken. The landlord assuredly has homeowners insurance but she\u2019s not paying big premiums to cover you guys getting drunk and injured or tearing up the house. Yes I\u2019m sure you have a deposit but trust me when I tell you that if you really break something big - that can easily exceed the your deposit. That doesn\u2019t mean it stops there. If it\u2019s bad enough, she can take you to court for the rest of the damages. If you guys were doing stuff that\u2019s illegal and/or breaking the lease?
