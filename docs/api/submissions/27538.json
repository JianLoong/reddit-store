I really like John but it\u2019s worth mentioning that John grew up very differently from both me and my DH in that he comes from a wealthy family who supported him financially until he graduated from college and got his first job working for a major bank. He doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor or work a lower paying service job and have to make ends meet because he never had to. I don\u2019t think it makes him a bad person, just out of touch with reality. \n\nThat leads me to this: one thing about John is that I absolutely hate going out to eat with him. He is so rude to servers and will often find reasons to not tip them. He has a habit of trying to order off menu or adding so many modifications to a dish that it\u2019s no longer recognizable and will get angry if it\u2019s even a little bit wrong (he doesn\u2019t have any allergies or intolerances). Dining with him can be embarrassing and mentally exhausting. \n\nLast night was the last straw for me. The three of us and another couple decided to try a newer restaurant in our city. After being seated, John seemed to be on his best behavior. No complicated cocktail or food order, in fact he got a glass of wine and only made two modifications to his entree. The only negative was that our server seemed to be in the weeds because of how busy the restaurant was but she was pleasant and you could tell she was trying her best to keep us happy which is all that should matter. John got pissed because she wasn\u2019t refilling his water as soon as he finished it, his second glass of wine took a while, and our entrees took about a half hour to get out. All the while he\u2019s talking about how this was going to be reflected on his tip. I was annoyed. And then when our entrees did come out, one of his mods didn\u2019t come out right and he went ballistic on the server, told her how dumb she was, etc. I\u2019ve never seen him get that angry with a server before, usually he\u2019s just passive aggressive. In response, I lost it at him and told him that he was overreacting to such a small slight and that it probably wasn\u2019t her fault.

Of course John left no tip so I doubled mine to make up for it. \n\nIn the parking lot, I told him that I would never eat out with him ever again if he was going to continue to act entitled to restaurant workers. I added that he needed to humble himself and not act like he\u2019s above anyone who doesn\u2019t work a white collar job because not all of us were born into money and left without saying goodbye.

Making alterations to a dish for any reason other than food allergies is AH behavior to begin with. If you simply don't like something,  that's in a dish, order something else.

When a ticket comes back with alterations,  it slows everything down, because now I have to stop and think about it.
