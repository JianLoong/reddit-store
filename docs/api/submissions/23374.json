I've never even heard of something like that. I will say I think it's in poor taste of her to include your face. \n \n \n \n \nIn the future, I would recommend telling your tattoo artists upfront that any pictures taken should be deleted.

You have every right to be uncomfortable.", "It\u2019s fine if I can\u2019t find another artist to work on it.

Whatever.\nUse it as a lesson learned. \nAlways state what you want and get their promise to do or not do it in writing. \n\nAnd this goes for all areas of life. People can't read your mind, and the only person who is going to advocate for you is you. Have the foresight to predict potential consequences of not communicating. And if you don't communicate your expectations,  you can't logically complain when a person doesn't live up to your exoect.", "But you must have seen the IG and other social media pages for the shop. You could have also said something about how you didn\u2019t want the picture up there just to be sure.\n\nEven when you sign up for a gym membership, there can be a clause in there that they are able to take pictures of you for marketing and you need to inform them in writing if you don\u2019t want it. An artist showing their work is not unusual, and you sound like you were incredibly rude to her. She probably pressed you multiple times because you weren\u2019t clear on why you didn\u2019t want the picture up, and it wasn\u2019t until you threw a mini hissy fit that you finally clarified the issue.", "No, I'm not. \n\nYou had an issue. \nYou assumed your tattoo artist could read your mind.\nYou got upset when she didn't read your mind. \nYou wanted the photo taken down. \nShe took it down.\nNow you're trying to play victim on Reddit.\n\nIt's i dustry stabdard for tattoo artists to post oictures of the tattoos.

Then you got mad at her for not reading your mind.", "They were for me. I expressed this multiple times.

Saying it isn\u2019t is honestly bullshit.", "I can expect professionalism in a business. And it\u2019s a part of law in many industries to ask for consent for peoples photos and likeness.", "It\u2019s not industry standard to not ask for consent. I\u2019ve had written or verbal consent from every artist I\u2019ve had, there\u2019s another tattoo artist who expressed the same thing within this thread. She did not communicate and was unprofessional, and I reacted in the way that felt appropriate to me. It\u2019s okay you don\u2019t feel the same because I know my truth now.", "You flat out asked for people's opinions about your reaction. So I gave you mine and you didn't like it. You obviously didn't actually want everyone's opinions. You only wanted opinions of people who would validate your own.", "She was professional. You weren\u2019t clear with her on why you wanted the picture taken down, and she was having a conversation with you. If you said the first time what you finally said to her on the 3rd exchange, it would have prevented some of it. You seem to be projecting on this woman big time. It\u2019s fine to not want the picture posted and for her to be surprised, and she has now learned to ask for consent. But you could have also been a lot clearer and been more mature about the situation.", "You're STILL going? \nI thought we were done.", "Nope, you\u2019re just stating things that\u2019s aren\u2019t universally true and I want to tell you that because other people should know that asking consent for peoples likeness is standard practice.", "And you're STILL still going.\n*eye roll*", "Like I said, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t agree with me. But I will state my case if you keep going. You replied, and I responded. And you can be mad about that if you want."]}
