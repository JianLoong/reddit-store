Because it\u2019s so standard, I feel like it would also be easy for an artist to confuse consent to taking the pics with consent to post them, if you didn\u2019t mention during the photographing that you wouldn\u2019t want them shared. But once it was clear that you WERE uncomfortable and the artist got defensive / tried to wheedle to post the pics elsewhere, that benefit of the doubt goes out the window.

Just because the customers are using their artists' time and talents (which OP paid for) doesn't give the artists permission to post photos of nude customers. \n\nPosting pictures of the art/tattoo on paper is debatable based on if the art is made by the customer or the artist themselves.\n\nSo, the expectations should be to give at least a heads up about photo policy if they have any.\n\nNot arguing with your POV, just stating my opinion. I agree with the NTA judgement.", "All tattoo artists who have tattooed me have taken pics of the tattoos and never asked about posting. Not all of the artists have posted my tattoos either. One session my butt was partially exposed as well, she blurred it. I think insta took it down though. The tattoo on my hip, my artist at the time brought up posting and I think I said something along the lines of just not mentioning me but otherwise no one would know who it was. This is how they market their work and there are a lot of memes/reels etc out there about how customers are sad when their tattoos don't get posted.", "What?? If a client said no to posting their pictures, but I spent 10 hours on their tattoo, damn right I'd want a picture of it for my personal collection.", "Just because you make art doesn't mean you can do anything with it you want. That's how commissioning works.", "Thanks. I definitely am never going back. It\u2019s actually such a sense of relief to say that after this ordeal, despite the tattoo being unfinished.", "Nope, that's not how commissions work.", "As an artist that takes commissions\u2026 You\u2019re absolutely wrong lmao. I\u2019m not allowed to just post all the stuff I make for others without their consent. They paid for the art; it is now *theirs* and they get to choose if it gets posted and where it\u2019s posted, not me.", "OP's face and ass are not \"just the work\".", "Just because your experience is different doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m necessarily wrong in my reaction. My standard practice for every artist is that I got consent. I did communicate that I did not want it posted. Three times until she removed it and she never expressed that she would post something like that on social media. Typically, actually, she only posts finished pieces.", "I think their comment is more \u201cwhy would you trust them to do something permanent on your body when they don\u2019t have you sign the standard consent form\u201d which usually includes clauses about any harm that may occur from the procedure, allows the tattoo artist to verify your identity, and shows the artist does their practice safely (forms make you agree that you are of sound mind, are sober, and have no health concerns that could be effected by being tattooed)", "I dont have tattoos so not sure how it works.  But I think you said the tattoo is not finished = will you be able to find another tattoo artist to finish the tattoo for you since you don't want to work with her?", "There\u2019s usually a form that says you\u2019re free of drugs and alcohol, the shop isn\u2019t responsible for harm, etc and then you consent to your tattoo being on social. Something seems sketchy that there was no form. Either that or the OP signed something and didn\u2019t read all of it.", "Yeahhh, as an artist that takes commissions myself\u2026 This person doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Once you sell the art to someone, it is now *their property*, not yours. They get to choose where it\u2019s posted to/if it\u2019s posted at all, and it\u2019s standard practice for just about every art industry to ask for consent before sharing a commission.", "That's true, I read it as the back and behind, didn't specify how much of the work vs body is seen so it was more of a hypothetical reply on that end", "Did you expect every single person to vote the same way? The person you\u2019re replying to has their opinion and that\u2019s what this sub is about. Accept the votes. They\u2019re going in your favor as it is.", "It\u2019s okay if I don\u2019t finish it. It\u2019s not really my main concern right now for the moment and I don\u2019t have a problem with it being unfinished", "Motat tattoo artists don't finish other artists' work, they state that when trying to book. Due to harassment within the industry some artists will at least point you to someone else if you're unable to get the piece done by the original artist due harassment, etc.", "Clients aren't in the industry. You don't get to do a kinda shitty thing because it's \"standard in the industry\".", "Is posting a pic of a tattoo a shitty thing? The artist was clearly proud of her work and excited to finish it, and she took it down when OP complained. Its standard for any kind of artist to share pics of their work to social media to advertise their business.", "Ok", "I never signed any type of agreement and even if there was an IG page with photos of other people, that doesn\u2019t clarify whether the artist was given consent or not to post them. It is standard practice for every other artist to ask for verbal or written consent. That is standard practice in many industries.", "It is not a law in the tattoo industry. While having a consent form would be good, it\u2019s not the law so she technically didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "I literally gave you an example in my post of another industry, but thanks for clarifying\u2026", "And you could have been clear when she did post. But you weren\u2019t clear with her with the reasons why, and it wasn\u2019t until she asked you clarifying questions that she finally understood what made you upset. Fine if you didn\u2019t want them posted but don\u2019t be super rude to her when she\u2019s just trying to understand your reasoning. You could have handled the situation in a much more mature way.", "Op is arguing with anyone saying its standard practice. Argue all you want but its still standard practice", "I think asking for someone\u2019s written or verbal consent is a bigger issue than what I did or did not say to her while I was getting the tattoo. I certainly did NOT say \u201cyes, I want you to post this\u201d. I wanted photos for myself and myself only. She never expressed that she would post it and it is standard practice for many artists to do so. That is in no way projecting.", "I was clear with her that I didn\u2019t want the photos posted. She never communicated that she would post them or asked for my consent. That is inherently immature.", "You clearly aren\u2019t bothering to comprehend any of my comments about her trying to have a conversation with you, so I\u2019m not going to bother arguing with you. You posted on here with a very specific mindset and don\u2019t seem to be open to others\u2019 lived experiences and interpretations of the situation. Not sure why you posted at all if you already had your mind made up.\n\nAlso, so you are aware, while it may be standard practice to ask for consent before posting on social media in the tattoo industry, it is not the law. If you ask for something to not be posted when the artist photographs it or ask for it to be taken down after the fact, they will. She took it down after you asked her to.", "Read the comment. It clearly has to do with how you interacted with her *after* the picture was posted.", "I was referring to after she posted them. You don\u2019t have anything in your post about having said anything to her when she took the pictures.\n\nAnd if you were upset with her for posting, fine. That\u2019s your prerogative. But her coming back to you as an artist to try to see if she could still share the work and explaining to you why she wanted to is reasonable. She then told you that you just had to be clear with her if you wanted it posted or not and you\u2019re calling that callous, which seems to be a huge over exaggeration.\n\nWhen you said you didn\u2019t want it posted, which was an answer to a question she asked you, she took it down. She was not turning anything around on you. She was giving you a simple explanation and why several people here are telling you that you overreacted. It\u2019s also why I said you could have acted much more mature because reading your post, she really does come across as someone trying to have a conversation with you and that you were projecting onto her instead of taking a step back and realizing that it was an honest mistake on her part and wanting to see if you were willing to compromise."]}
