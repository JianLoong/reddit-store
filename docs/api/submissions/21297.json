Alcohol, drugs, pretty much everything was involved.\n\nShe did not stop because of me but I know that my general reluctance to do these types of things was a turning-point for her.\n\nShe even introduced me to cocaine, mdma, etc but since I was not particularly enjoying any of these, she kinda slowed down and eventually stopped 3 years ago.\n\nWe have been talking about having a kid since january. I love her so much and I really want her to be the mother of my children.\n\nShe's been taking vitamins, I have been exercising etc. But 6 months and nothing yet. I know it can take some time some I am not overly worried.\n\nBut last weekend, one of her friends from her \"past\" spent the weekend in our flat. They both smoked a lot of weed, did some coke et drank a lot. Prior to this weekend, she was ovulating and we pretty much had sex 2-3 times a day during that period.\n\nI have been distant since and I feel like she doesn't take seriously our commitment to have a kid. I am actually hoping she's not pregnant. On the slim chance I would have impregnated her last week, I feel like the week-end of partying would have destroyed that.\n\nI told her that and her reaction was to tell me relax and since she was not pregnant and there were no signs of her being pregnant, that it was not that big of a deal.\n\nI am reconsidering a lot of things and I'm worried that maybe she doesn't want to have kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA ?\n\nTL;DR : My wife and I are trying to have a child but she partied like there was no tomorrow(drugs&alcohol), just after a huge period of trying\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate : Did not expect for this post to blow up. \n\nWe had a long talk and we both managed to say what we wanted to say. \n\nShe apologized and realized that what she did was stupid. I apologized as well for flipping out and not communicating my feelings properly. We are going to reevaluate our desire to have a child for the foreseeable future. I'm still angry, disappointed, but overall mostly sad. I love this woman with all my heart and it pains me to see her do stuff like this. Since we are not going to invite her friends anytime soon and I know there are no reasons for her to do drugs anymore, I feel confident that she will stay clean. \n\nMaybe I'm fooling myself, maybe her friends is just the worst influence ever, or maybe it was just an opportunity and she jumped on it. I guess time will tell.\n\nThanks for all the support, both from YTA and NTA people. I haven't had the time to read every single comment but some of them were comforting.\n\nUpdate TL;DR : Not going to divorce my wife, I love her.

She should knock it off at this point though. I don\u2019t know the rates of miscarriage related to cocaine, however. \n\nAll that being said, time for a frank talk with her about the situation. If you\u2019ve been trying for 6 months, does she feel pressure because she\u2019s not conceiving (obviously not from you, but from herself)? What made her say, \u201ceff it, I\u2019m gonna do what I want during the wait period\u201d?\n\nI know when I was trying, it was difficult mentally. I can\u2019t say I went on a coke bender, but it certainly messed with my head. I certainly reverted to some self-destructive behaviors because it was constant. Try, wait, try, wait. It was endless and honestly exhausting to constantly have to watch what I ate and have zero outlets. \n\nI\u2019ve been in your shoes, too- my other half didn\u2019t do some tests he was supposed to on time, so I went through an entire month of fertility treatments for what could have been no good reason if it\u2019d been something he needed to have fixed. It was infuriating to the point that I had to take a few days to cool off before I could even talk to him about it.

If coke is a hard boundary tell her that (I don't think that's unreasonable I have asked my husband not to use that with friends) but weed and alcohol are legal in almost all states and are pretty minor stuff. If this is a once every year or so type thing to relieve stress that honestly sounds like a healthy release. It is not okay for you to ban her from doing things she enjoys \n\nAlso to clear up for you, even if she was pregnant drinking and smoking that early will not hurt it. If she can't even get a positive pregnancy test yet then it's too early to be worrying about what she eats. Also be careful about putting a lot of pressure on her. That can make it much harder to get pregnant. If anything you both need a few drinks and to just relax.\n\nETA based on replies, if they had a prior discussion where he directly said her using that again was a hard boundary then my judgement changes to N T A. I just feel if you're going to set that hard of a boundary you should communicate that clearly and not assume the other person knows.

LOL!!!", "We\u2019ll it all started in 2015\u2026. (Proceeds to retell the history of the Trump presidency up until 1/6/21) \u2026 and then they literally tried to overthrow the government out of a pity party (continues until last week) \u2026 and now those appointed justices get to just rule the country by proxy for 40 years because we don\u2019t have term limits for them \n\n(Sorry not mansplaining just bitter)", "You seem to be the one that\u2019s struggling.\n\nYou have no idea if someone is ready for a child or not based on whether or not they abstain from drinking. It takes some people years to conceive, OP even said they\u2019ve been trying for 6 months. You expect women to just not ever drink during those 6 months? There are plenty of people who drink pre-pregnancy while TTC that have no issue in abstaining once they are pregnant. I would know, as I\u2019ve done it twice, and am a completely adequate parent.", "Man, I really don't get what Reddit has with constantly nitpicking everything people say. Not a jab to you or anything, but geez. It's not like they spread mayor misinformation", "Wait what? I said I agreed with you, she probably isn't as serious about getting pregnant as OP is. Just wanted to get the facts straight.", "In the U.K. the first aid courses I\u2019ve done over the years have flip flopped back and forth on instructing to check for a pulse. Initially what you\u2019ve put above is what I was taught, literally as a child they would teach basic first aid in places like brownies including feeling for a pulse in someone you were partnered up with - I\u2019m not really sure what help an 8 year old would be jumping up and down on a full grown adult but I guess it gave me a lot of other basic first aid knowledge, even just knowing to keep calm and call an ambulance. But then next time I did training they said they no longer taught people to feel for a pulse because people are inherently bad at it and will very often feel their own pulse and think it\u2019s fine. So I guess they were advocating there to start CPR if someone wasn\u2019t breathing which seems\u2026. A bit nuts. I then did a full paediatric first aid course for babysitting and they taught to feel pulses etc. But the most recent one I did through work I think they were back to saying don\u2019t try and find a pulse. That was just a one day one though through work so the whole thing was incredibly cursory and may account for some of the differences.\n\nIf I was ever in the situation I would revert to the most comprehensive training I did, even if very out of date, and feel for a pulse at the same time as checking for breathing. I wouldn\u2019t feel very confident in a life or death situation I would be able to tell either though quite honestly.", "Thank you... when i checked myself in and spoke to the doctors they kept saying heroin is a 97% chance of relapse especially in the first year. After they repeatedly said it i finally said how bout we focus on the fact that im going to be one of the 3%. Like why keep saying that it def wasnt helping me.", "Our fentanyl dose is 1 mcg/kg \n\nKept it in mg above for simplicity of comparison for the lay person", "I would note that they are two different situations.  One where you are with a patient who has surging epi and tons of pain with nothing else on board and after surgery where the cocktail of anesthetic drugs makes that high if a dose crazy unless you like pushing narcan.  Plus, we are so good with nerve blocks and preemptive analgesia most people are not in much pain. Also, doing endoscopy or colonoscopies, people are nervous but no pain and usually are tired, we give good doses but slowly and in small increments titrating  to effect. The one time I\u2019ve had to use narcan in 20+ years was at a dose you don\u2019t think twice of giving.  So, you give big doses but for reasons.\n\nEdit: plus patient population can play as well.  Healthy vs sickly etc", "About a year ago I had a medical emergency and disclosed I was a daily weed user.  The provider got very serious and told me I need to either grow my own or buy packaged Delta 8 (etc) because the city was full of fentanyl-laced street weed (not a legal state).  It shocked me, logistically I don't really understand it, but it was a known enough problem that they warned me.", "No no don\u2019t apologize. It\u2019s fucked up. It\u2019s incredibly upsetting, and the level of acceptance of hatred, racism, sexism, and ignorance is astounding.", "Apparently you\u2019re also still struggling with the difference between drinking and heavy drinking.\n\nWhy are you incapable of simply reading and understanding every word I\u2019ve written? \n\nAnd why is it insane to suggest that parents shouldn\u2019t drink heavily for 6 months when they absolutely can\u2019t for 9 or more if they breastfeed???"]}
