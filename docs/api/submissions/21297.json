Lots of folks do idiot stuff before they get the positive test, and if it all caused FAS/substance issues, we\u2019d have a considerable more messed up population. \n\nAlcohol tends to cause some of the worst birth defects. In countries where 34% of women report heavy drinking throughout the entire pregnancy, there\u2019s a roughly 4-5% rate of FAS. \n\nSo, no need to panic if she does end up pregnant. She should knock it off at this point though. I don\u2019t know the rates of miscarriage related to cocaine, however. \n\nAll that being said, time for a frank talk with her about the situation. If you\u2019ve been trying for 6 months, does she feel pressure because she\u2019s not conceiving (obviously not from you, but from herself)? What made her say, \u201ceff it, I\u2019m gonna do what I want during the wait period\u201d?\n\nI know when I was trying, it was difficult mentally. I can\u2019t say I went on a coke bender, but it certainly messed with my head. I certainly reverted to some self-destructive behaviors because it was constant. Try, wait, try, wait. It was endless and honestly exhausting to constantly have to watch what I ate and have zero outlets. \n\nI\u2019ve been in your shoes, too- my other half didn\u2019t do some tests he was supposed to on time, so I went through an entire month of fertility treatments for what could have been no good reason if it\u2019d been something he needed to have fixed. It was infuriating to the point that I had to take a few days to cool off before I could even talk to him about it. We\u2019ve moved past it because he genuinely does want to be a father (it\u2019s something he\u2019s always made clear from the beginning of our relationship, however). \n\nIf you two decide to keep trying, depending on your ages and insurance situation, you may want to consider going ahead and talking to a fertility specialist.", "You don't need this judgement you need to talk to each other", "Dunno if you're an asshole but you're kind of na\u00efve.

However I do feel like she was just trying to let off a little steam before taking a massive step into parenthood.

I truly don't know what's going through peoples minds with the \"YTA\" votes.\n\nI don't mean to cause unnecessary worry, but I personally wouldn't like my children growing up in a home with frequent or non-frequent drug use. It's unstable and bad for children's development both mentally and physically to use drugs in their vicinity. \n\nI would personally, as much as I love my partner, leave them if this is how they were acting whilst knowingly trying to conceive a baby.

If coke is a hard boundary tell her that (I don't think that's unreasonable I have asked my husband not to use that with friends) but weed and alcohol are legal in almost all states and are pretty minor stuff. If this is a once every year or so type thing to relieve stress that honestly sounds like a healthy release. It is not okay for you to ban her from doing things she enjoys \n\nAlso to clear up for you, even if she was pregnant drinking and smoking that early will not hurt it. If she can't even get a positive pregnancy test yet then it's too early to be worrying about what she eats. Also be careful about putting a lot of pressure on her. That can make it much harder to get pregnant.

Choose very carefully if you want to pursue parenthood with her. Maybe give her one more chance but if she does go back to hard drugs once more leave. \n\nDivorce or seperation is a verg big life/financial decision, but it's easier now then after you have a kid.
