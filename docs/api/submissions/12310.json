Things have been going pretty well. We text from time to time and hang out sometimes. He's met my fiance (35m, Cole) a couppe of times now, and has been pretty respectful of our relatuonship. \n\nAnyway, Jake and I were texting yesterday evening when he randomly asked if I had any didos. I'll be honest, i was a little put off and concerned that he would ask such a question, but I've always been a very sex-positive individual, and so I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and just roll with it. So I answered honestly with an \"Uhh...no...??\" \n\nHe texted back \"I could give you a little something to have fun with\" and then sent a picture of his...male member, if you know what I mean...\n\nI'll be honest. I lost my cool at this point. I sent him a wall of text (which I know, it's generally considered rude to send a dozen texts when you could've just sent one. But I was just so upset, I wasn't really thinking.) So here's what I said: \n\n\nDude. Wtf. No. \n\nYou do not send an unsolicited d*ck pic. \n\nEver. \n\nNo woman wants an unsolicit d*ck pic unless explictly stated. \n\nI do not know who is going around telling men that women want d*ck pics but they are wromg. No woman wants random d*ck pics!\n\nI am in a relationship!\n\nYou need to respect that!\n\nI do not want to see that sh*t.\n\nI'm not trying to recieve random ass d*ck pics while I'm right here with my man.\n\nI am trying to eat my dinner. \n\nUnsolicited d*ck pics are a very effective way to ruin a meal. \n\nI learned that today. \n\nThat is disgusting!\n\nDo not send unsolicited d*ck pics. Ever. That is a rule.  You are a grown ass man. You should know that by now.\n\n\nSo yeah. I stated my opinion and (I believe) firmly established that boundary. He apologized at first. But then backtracked the next morning and said he expected an apology from my for \"being so harsh\" and saying I \"didn't have to be like that\". \n\nI believe I've done nothing wrong, and have nothing to apologize for. But I spoke to another friend who siad I do need to apologize because I \"don't know what that does to a man's confidence\" to be rejected so harshly. \n\nBut the way I see it, he should have never set himself up to be rejected. If he couldn't handle being turned down, he should have just not inapropriately exposed himself to me. I don't think I should have to apologize for his inapropriateness and lack of boundaries. \n\nSo.
