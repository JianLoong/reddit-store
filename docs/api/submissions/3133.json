{"id": 3133, "submission_id": "z3kns1", "title": "WIBTA for not choosing my sister-in-law as godmother to my child?", "selftext": "Throwaway, for obvious reasons. Sorry for the long read, I tried to add as much context as I could. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my now-husband for a total of 8 years and we have a 3.5 month old child. He has 2 older brothers. Unfortunately, the one he was closest with, the oldest, passed away several years ago. The death shattered his family apart. My late brother-in-law\u2019s wife and her kids rarely come around unless it\u2019s a big family event. My remaining brother-in-law took his time coming back around again. He is married with 3 kids and if it weren\u2019t for his kids,\nI don\u2019t think he would want to come around either. In every conversation with my in-laws, my late BIL is brought up and the mood turns somber. It isn\u2019t always that pleasant to be around. \n\nMy remaining BIL is married to a woman that is a lying, manipulative narcissist. She was nice to me at first, but I had been warned by my husband and in-laws to be careful around her, without any more explanation. As the years passed, I noticed my SIL would treat my MIL and FIL (in their 60\u2019s) as if they were on-call baby sitters for her 3 kids. There was no flexibility around holiday get togethers because her family had a schedule. If we didn\u2019t follow her schedule, or suggested a date shuffle, she would hold my nieces and nephew hostage by saying things like: \u201cif you don\u2019t have it this day, you won\u2019t see the kids this Christmas. I\u2019m not moving my availability\u201d.  When my other SIL and I try to suggest a rotation so we get a chance to see our families, she tells us that it would be our fault that our families couldn\u2019t accommodate a change instead. \n\nThis is the same woman that wore a white dress to my wedding and put her kids in the same matching white dresses, swore at my mother on my wedding day, refused to treat me as part of the family until my husband and I were married (I was responsible for buying her children gifts for birthdays and Christmas but she wouldn\u2019t read my name out on the cards, only my husbands). And to top it off will always try to one-up me. I have a much closer relationship with my inlaws than she does. \n\nWithout listing off more than the above, this woman has belittled me, brought me to tears without apology, tormented me, made comments about me being a \u201chalf breed\u201d because I am only half Italian, not full (like her). My MIL and FIL won\u2019t say anything because of their fear my BIL wont come around. My husband always jumps to my defence when he is witness to her actions. \n\nMy husband would like to choose my BIL as godfather to our child. However, it is customary that when you choose a married person, their spouse is automatically the other godparent. My in laws feel strongly about this and do not want me to \u201ccause any problems\u201d over picking godparents. \n\nKnowing it may cause my SIL to freak out, and my inlaws to be upset for breaking tradition, WIBTA for choosing my BIL as godfather and telling my SIL she is not the godmother?\n\n\nEDIT: wow, did not expect this to blow up like it did. It\u2019s sparking some very healthy discussion and debate and I love it! I appreciate all the feedback. \n\nI wanted to clarify in the original post (and not replying to individual comments) about the custom of godparents being married exists on both sides of my family. I am fine with breaking this tradition and my family is supportive of this too. Even my husband doesn\u2019t want my SIL anywhere near our child. We will be dealing with drama any way we slice it (choosing BIL and NOT SIL, or choosing 2 different people), but my husband cannot think of any other person he would wait to make godparent. I\u2019d love to stick it to my SIL, but I have no support from my inlaws. They are too concerned with speaking up and my BIL saying \u201cf you\u201d to the family. They are still very damaged from the passing of my other BIL.", "created_utc": 1669298312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3kns1/wibta_for_not_choosing_my_sisterinlaw_as/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might just be something they made up.", "Right, everyone I know has godparents, but it\u2019s usually like dad\u2019s brother and mom\u2019s sister.

So guardianship needs to be done via a will.", "Rather go with 2 entirely different people. She sounds like she\u2019s controlling to her husband as well, so making BIL godfather will be indirectly making her one. For your sanity and peace of mind avoid her and BIL completely.", "Yeah well, I was under that completely misguided notion when I wrote that, but through unintentional bad wording of my answer, managed to convince you that I was not. ;-) So basically, what I wrote above, I wrote on the topic of naming someone to be a legal guardian in case the parents can't take care of their kids.\n\nHowever, the same goes for godparents. I quite early became an atheist, but I do have stoutly catholic family and friends of different faiths. I also know people who claim they are devout christians, even to have found god in prison and dedicated their life to \"HIM\", but try to fuck over others, including their neighbours, every chance they get, for their own personal monetary gain or plain pettyness. My genuinely nice aunt would never do that.\n\nIf I were to assign someone to help my imaginary children in their faith, I would certainly not expect someone to do so well on the basis that he announced he pledged his life to god and discusses the bible three hours a week. I would look on the people they influenced, and how they kept themselves in real life. Do I get the impression that they live the religious values they preach and I care for? In case of her SIL, I would doubt that. Of course, I don't know what SIL considers the core values of her faith. In case of my aunt, I would deduce it is altruism, humbleness, and, \\*sigh\\*, chastity. (honestly. My cousin was not allowed to sleep with her soon to be husband in one room in my aunt's house a month before their wedding and after 5 years of relationship). Overall, I'd say she passes, while OP's SIL does not. The flaws don't outweigh the good, and that goes for spiritual values as much as for basic humanity. Of course, if I were to follow a religion that deified Trump, I might look for the valous selfishness and scorn. So SIL might make the cut.\n\nI don't see much sense in using different metrics, when judging possible guardians or godparents - unless we're discussing material ressources here. I might consider ignoring some minor flaws on the character side, if the ressources of the guardian are good enough. Because, sadly, those ressources are important for the prospects of a child. And depending on the flaws, a kid might be better off and happier in life despite their somewhat assholey guardian.\n\nHowever, mine is a naive stance, as I haven't been in the position to either offer or take that position."]}
