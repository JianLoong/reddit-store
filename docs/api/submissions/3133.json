Sorry for the long read, I tried to add as much context as I could. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my now-husband for a total of 8 years and we have a 3.5 month old child. He has 2 older brothers. Unfortunately, the one he was closest with, the oldest, passed away several years ago. The death shattered his family apart. My late brother-in-law\u2019s wife and her kids rarely come around unless it\u2019s a big family event. My remaining brother-in-law took his time coming back around again. He is married with 3 kids and if it weren\u2019t for his kids,\nI don\u2019t think he would want to come around either. In every conversation with my in-laws, my late BIL is brought up and the mood turns somber. It isn\u2019t always that pleasant to be around. \n\nMy remaining BIL is married to a woman that is a lying, manipulative narcissist. She was nice to me at first, but I had been warned by my husband and in-laws to be careful around her, without any more explanation. As the years passed, I noticed my SIL would treat my MIL and FIL (in their 60\u2019s) as if they were on-call baby sitters for her 3 kids. There was no flexibility around holiday get togethers because her family had a schedule. If we didn\u2019t follow her schedule, or suggested a date shuffle, she would hold my nieces and nephew hostage by saying things like: \u201cif you don\u2019t have it this day, you won\u2019t see the kids this Christmas. I\u2019m not moving my availability\u201d.  When my other SIL and I try to suggest a rotation so we get a chance to see our families, she tells us that it would be our fault that our families couldn\u2019t accommodate a change instead. \n\nThis is the same woman that wore a white dress to my wedding and put her kids in the same matching white dresses, swore at my mother on my wedding day, refused to treat me as part of the family until my husband and I were married (I was responsible for buying her children gifts for birthdays and Christmas but she wouldn\u2019t read my name out on the cards, only my husbands). And to top it off will always try to one-up me. I have a much closer relationship with my inlaws than she does. \n\nWithout listing off more than the above, this woman has belittled me, brought me to tears without apology, tormented me, made comments about me being a \u201chalf breed\u201d because I am only half Italian, not full (like her). My MIL and FIL won\u2019t say anything because of their fear my BIL wont come around. My husband always jumps to my defence when he is witness to her actions. \n\nMy husband would like to choose my BIL as godfather to our child. However, it is customary that when you choose a married person, their spouse is automatically the other godparent. My in laws feel strongly about this and do not want me to \u201ccause any problems\u201d over picking godparents. \n\nKnowing it may cause my SIL to freak out, and my inlaws to be upset for breaking tradition, WIBTA for choosing my BIL as godfather and telling my SIL she is not the godmother?", "created_utc": 1669298312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3kns1/wibta_for_not_choosing_my_sisterinlaw_as/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, it sounds like she wouldn't take the role of godmother all that seriously anyway, even if you did choose her. It might be easier not to make BIL the godfather, but at the end of the day it's your choice who you appoint as godparents of your child, regardless of traditions or potential dramas.", "NTA.

And aren't they often the people who would take care of your kids if anything happens? In either case, absolutely do not pick her..and do not pick your bil if she would be caring for your kids at any point. Pick a women in your family or your bff. That way you are honoring your relative or best friend with the godmother and he is picking the godfather. That is completely fair. And if she has issues, that's her problem.

After all, they seemed to have raised a decent man in OPs husband.", "I was going to say this.  \n\nI actually have two godparents, one from either side of the family, both are married (and were when I was born), yet their spouses are both not named as godparents, it is done, actually quite frequently.\n\nHOWEVER you have to remind yourself that if the worst happens and BIL would have to take care of your kid she would be in the same household and would not treat them well.  I wouldn't name either one, TBH I would probably pick a close friend to avoid family drama. NTA", "I don't know why people think that happens in America.

Leading our child through their journey of faith and to raise our child if something happens to us.\n\nIn either scenario, I have never considered making my SIL a godparent. In fact, I want to move away from my BIL even being an option because it means my child may spend more time with my SIL than I am comfortable with. Perhaps that\u2019s petty, but it is only my husband and my inlaws that feel my BIL should play that role.", "I should have clarified that I have never and would never consider making her godparent. I entertained the idea of my BIL being godparent purely out of respect for my husband. I\u2019d only consider it if i could make it abundantly clear that my SIL is not godmother. However, that comes with lots of backlash from my husbands family (not from my husband), and given the tragic loss of my late BIL, I want to be mindful not to tip anyone over the edge.

It might hurt your husband if you say you don\u2019t want his brother. But if you can safe your child is worth. Traditions are good, but you can also create new ones. Is your BIL under the control of her or does he also understand what she is doing to his family?", "Good point.
