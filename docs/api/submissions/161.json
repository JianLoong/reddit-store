This school year, we have had issues with our twins in school. We've heard that due to the pandemic issues in the middle school became worse schoolwide, especially with the 8th graders, with kids being delayed, not handing in work and more. I want to give some context and say this is a well off district in a wealthy, majority white suburb. My wife and I fall into that category, we earn a very decent living and always try to teach our kids about their wealth and racial privileges. \n\nAs I mentioned, we\u2019ve heard the 8th grade class at our twin\u2019s middle school is pretty wild and hard to manage this year. Our kids are no exception to this. Our son has had less behavioral issues then our daughter. We have responded to every email and phone call from teachers. Obviously, different things work better with every kid. For our son, detention normally seems to get him in line, we have talked to both kids privately, our son seems to respect stricter teachers more, being punitive is more effective with him, especially when it involves his coach giving him extra laps or push ups. When our daughter gets the same punishments as son for that behavior, it doesn\u2019t seem to work nearly as well, we are trying out best to see what will work with her but it\u2019s not easy. \n\nLast Thursday, our children had an essay due in English class, they have the same english teacher, after seeing the turn in rate (61/138) among all of her classes, she told the kids she would give them a week to hand it in (meaning it\u2019s due this Thursday) or they would get a 0. My son had handed his essay in; he knows his coach won\u2019t let him and his friends play if they are failing a class, so they worked together and helped each other on their essay. My daughter did not hand it in, in addition to that, she was already in trouble for being mean to a trans boy at school, her and her friends started hanging out with some geeky boys that have been a bad influence on them, including being transphobic. My son is friends with the trans boy so it was personal for us. Daughter is very grounded. \n\nWhen our daughter came home she told us she didn\u2019t hand in her essay and she needed help and asked if her brother could help, we asked him and he said no because \u201cit\u2019s not my job\u201d and said he already had plans for the weekend, going to the park and having a sleepover with \u201cthe boys\u201d. \n\nI told him that was fine, but my wife told him he should help. After arguing a bit, we went in our bedroom to sort things out and she eventually agreed to let daughter write on her own with occasional help from wife and I, although we are both not good at essay writing. Yesterday, my daughter came to me and wife and said we were being \u201cmean\u201d to her for not making him help and now wife is doubting our decision and saying I should change my mind, I still disagree.

He's right, it isn't his job.", "NTA it\u2019s not your kids\u2019 responsibility to parent the other children you all chose to have. \n\nSounds like your daughter needs to see a therapist as well.", "NTA.

Are you going to let her guide your parenting so she won't call you mean?", "NTA\n\nIt isn't her brother's job to help with homework, that falls on parents, teachers, and also the support systems at school.\n\nYour daughter clearly needs help.  But it seems to be as much organizational as anything else.\n\nThis was long ago (1980s) but my  father was connected with an organizational business through his work, that would sell day planners and also taught classes to workers needing to organize their work time efficiently.  He liked it so much he paid for my mother, my brother, and me (both me and my brother were in high school) to take the class, and buy the day planners.\n\nA similar class may help her a much as it did me.  The brand we used initially was bought up by the \"DayTimer\" brand [https://www.daytimer.com/](https://www.daytimer.com/) But the lessons in the class were as valuable as the physical paper two-page-per-day organizer we were taught to use, with long and short term planning.\n\nSee if you can get your child lessons in planning and organizing work, it will help a lot.\n\nETA: What really, really helped is that the entire family took these classes, got personal planners, and we also put a large (blotter size!) calendar on the wall for anything that affected more than one person (need a ride, need to use the car, etc.)", "NTA\n\nSo your wife wants to punish your son who didn't do anything wrong, turned his essay in on time, and has plans for the weekend?\n\nMy favourite line from a parenting book I read. \"Don't let the child drive the bus\"", "**NTA**    Aside from the obvious problem with her waiting until the last minute to do her work, I'm kinda stuck on the idea that anyone would think her twin should be the one to help her.

Why are you and your wife keeping them in a separate bubble?", "So your sons reward for being responsible and doing work on time is to force him to help his sister do hers?  That doesn\u2019t sound right. Next time he just won\u2019t do his work.", "Oops, NTA, my bad ~~Y T A~~ but you should have been offering your own help from jump instead of approaching your son, who did his work, to help his sister. Do not give in to your wife- this is genuinely your responsibility as a parent, not your sons.", "NTA. Your son has no obligation to help a sister who has been mean to his friend. Your daughter could perhaps talk to him and make a deal to get help. \n\nYou absolutely should not force your son to do this. Although you could also make a deal (pay $ or something) if you wanted. It would have to be fully agreed upon though.", "He should not help her and YOU need to crack down on her. Being mean to others? Acting up in school?", "NTA. Your desire to \"give onto her\" b/c she called you mean for not making her brother give up his earned free time to \"help\" her write her essay is a contributing factor to her behavior.

You know she wasn't looking for help, she was just planning on him doing it for her.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Your son did the work. Your daughter did not. It's on her and the both of you to help her make the grades she needs to. Her brother is his own person and is responsible for his own work. Making him help her is making him do double the work. Something tells me she wants his help explicitly to 'make' him write it for her or so that she can do the bare minimum.\n\nYou imply that you've been to every PT conference, call, email, and meeting. Have you asked any of her teachers whether they've noticed any issues with your daughter's ability to understand the material? Have you had her assessed for ADD/ADHD or other learning challenges?  Have you pulled her social media or assessed her friend group for undue influence? In other words, instead of harping about this one issue with the essay, your daughter needs a holistic solution. Have you sat her down and asked why she's bullying others? Have you asked her her reasoning for not doing her work and acting out so much? You all need to deal with the issue with her, not try to enlist your son to be responsible for his sister.", "NTA. Your son did his work and has plans. Homework like an essay is done solo. You are not being MEAN by making her do her OWN Homework. Do not change your mind.", "NTA\n\nI may sound like an old fart, but in 8th grade I was expected to do my own homework and contact teachers for help.

She will have to swim or sink on her own, and she is old enough to learn it.", "NTA\n\nHe did his essay. It would be a punishment to make him help with his sister just because she's unwilling to find the drive to do it herself. If she fails, then that's on her. If the consequence ends up being going to summer school because she failed a class, then hopefully that'll teach her to be more motivated and less lazy.\n\nYou should point to your son and say, \"If you want to do fun things like him, then you have to do your work.\"\n\nDon't change your mind. You're not your daughter's friend, you're their parent.", "NTA for not making your son help. He's not the parent here.\n\nYTA for everything else.

If the school environment is poor, start looking for other options.", "NTA \n\nTwins had the same amount of time to complete the essay. Son did his within the time frame given, daughter did not. Why should your son basically have to do another essay because your daughter didn't?\n\nPlus, this will be a lesson for the future for her. That she needs to complete it or risk getting a 0. Do not go back on this, as there's a chance your son will do most of it for her to get it over and done with as he has plans, then it becomes a expectation for her.", "ESH except your son. I don't care how much you suck at essay writing, you had no business asking your son to in the first place. I can see where your daughter gets he work ethic from. It's her essay, she can do it with or without your help, or she can get a zero. Period. Daughter being a transphobic bully is just the cherry on top. smh", "YTA. This can\u2019t be blamed on the pandemic, they are all badly behaved kids. Also I find this culture to be strange.

Do not teach her that she can wait and let you do the work. It\u2019s her job. You can work with her on time management if she needs it, you can get her a tutor if she struggles, but the school work is her duty and she needs to reap the consequences. \n\nWere you planning to sit her exams, too? No? Then she needs to work out what she needs to do her own work in time.", "How would that create a sense of competition or favoritism? All that I suggested was to point out the truth. That's not favoritism, it's stating fact. You don't finish your school work, you don't get to do fun things like your sibling who's being responsible. There's nothing wrong with that. It's called consequences.\n\nETA - Telling daughter that she needs to be performing at the same level would be creating a sense of competition. Just telling her to get it done is the bare minimum. I'm not saying they should demand perfection and A's every time from her. That does enable a toxic environment.", "I was going to bring this up.  These ideas and behaviors don't just magically appear in people's minds, chances are she is either being exposed to bigoted ideals either online or from someone in person, possibly either one of her friends' families or even someone in your own family.  \n\nI would ask the therapist for advice on getting to the source of these feelings.  If she's exposed to it often then it could easily undo all of the corrections in behavior you are working on.  I also wonder if her brother knows who the bad influence is if he's in the same class.", "Oh lol. That makes sense.", "It looked to me like the order of operations was that the daughter asked her brother first, not the parents. When he said no, dad backed him up and mom didn\u2019t. If that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t think OP is an asshole\u2014he didn\u2019t offer up son, daughter asked. Mom and daughter are, though."]}
