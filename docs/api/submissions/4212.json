{"id": 4212, "submission_id": "zfkn41", "title": "WIBTA for throwing out my daughter's art supplies?", "selftext": "My oldest daughter, 7, adores art. She is one of those rare children who can be sat down in front of some paper or a colouring book, and keep herself amused for, literally, hours. She was given some really nice art supplies for her birthday, and has been really enjoying using them. Her 2.5 year old sister also loves art and drawing.\n\nUnfortunately, Ms. 7 is also somewhat absent minded, and has a habit of leaving her drawing supplies all over the coffee table and the living room floor. We have been frequently reminding her to pick them up; and while she will do it if prompted, it's often forgotten about or not clearly noticed (their father stays home and I work full time; he's not the most observant person when it comes to mess and clutter, and my day is so packed with work, child care and other domestic stuff, I don't get a chance to go into the living room some days).\n\nI have repeatedly told her that her art material is her responsibility, and she needs to make sure it isn't left out where her sister can access it. However, she doesn't mind sharing them with her sister, and her sister is reasonably good about limiting her drawing to paper (ie not furniture or walls). I don't like the 2.5 year old being allowed to play with the textas as I worry about the choking hazards, but as I'm not home all the time, and my husband thinks the toddler is old enough to play with them and isn't prepared to enforce rules that he doesn't think are necessary, I don't make a huge fuss about it.\n\nThe 2.5 year old today (after an argument) put a texta lid in her mouth that her sister had left lying around, ran off, tripped and inhaled the lid.\n\nLuckily, her father was able to get it out before any harm was done and she wasn't hurt, but she could have died.\n\nFor me, this is the final straw. If I can't enforce rules to keep my younger daughter safe when I'm not there, I feel like I have no choice but to eliminate the hazard. \n\nWhen my daughter gets home from school, I'm going to tell her that any art supplies other than pencils and paper I find that aren't put out of the 2.5 year olds reach are going straight in the bin. No more reminders, no more warnings.\n\nI know how much these mean to her - and we couldn't afford to replace anything that gets thrown out - but I just don't feel like I would be able to keep her sister safe otherwise.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I throw out any choking hazards left within the reach of the toddler?", "created_utc": 1670462614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfkn41/wibta_for_throwing_out_my_daughters_art_supplies/", "score": 414, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rather than the adult who's supposed to be responsible?", "YTA.\n\nThrow your husband in the bin if he\u2019s supposed to be caring for your toddler and he can\u2019t be arsed. Punishing a 7 year old because dad is a dough head is rotten.", "So you are expecting a seven year old to be more observant in cleaning than a fully grown adult parent. Try making your husband be a parent to a small child and do his due diligence in maintaining a clean space for all your children. Tell your husband to step up and parent when he is home. As well do you really want to stifle your daughters creativity at 7?", "YWBTA- She\u2019s 7 for crying out loud. Obviously a 7 year old is going to forget, she\u2019s so young. Why not just tell her to leave it in her room and not let the 2.5 toddler not go inside? Why not have your SO enforce the rules so stuff like this doesn\u2019t happen? Maybe have them watch her better because where was everyone else when she put the lid in her mouth? The 7 year old is not responsible for your 2.5 year old, you and your SO are.

Kids need reminders to pick up after themselves. Why isn\u2019t your husband supervising your toddler? Don\u2019t blame the kid because the parent sucks at his job.", "YWBTA. That is harsh for a 7yo. A 7yo isn\u2019t absentminded, that is ok for her age. If she was 12 then yeah. Can you compromise? You can hide them and give them to her when you get home - seeing as you are the only non-absentminded and observant person there. I\u2019m not excusing her fathers incompetence in reminding your 7 yo to put her things away, but she shouldn\u2019t be punished for forgetting.", "YWBTA. Your problem isn\u2019t your 7 yr old child. it\u2019s your grown ass husband and you! You are telling both these kids that there is two set of rules in your house and the kids are confused. Get on the same page with your husband and stop blaming the kids.", "YWBTA. She is 7. As many others have said, give her a simple system that works. It might be as simple as a bin with a click lock lid that 2 year old can\u2019t open. She can keep all the supplies in the bin as she uses them, cleanup is as simple as closing the lid. \n\nNow, give her a system to follow. Dinner is at 6, art bin must be off the table by then (or whatever deadline you want her to clean up by. Think about your own projects and what seems reasonable- when you are working, do you put everything away before you use the bathroom? \n\nIf she misses the deadline to clean up, a reasonable punishment would be she loses the supplies for a day or two so she learns to care for them. \n\nMake a system, give her a plan, tell her the consequences. Make sure husband is on the same page. Everyone will be happier.", "So you have higher expectations for your 7yo than your husband? Idc how many arguments youve had over it, you dont give up making the adult be the safety patrol of the 2yo and instead force it on the 7yo.\n\nIf he cant do the job of keeping the kids safe, he can get a job outside the house to pay for a daycare that will keep them safe.", "YTA. She's 7. I also have a 7 year old. You are setting her up for failure. \n\nKids do the best they can. You as a parent have to set the guiderails to help her succeed. \n\nFind a place that she can use her art supplies that the toddler can't reach. In her room, and she keeps the door shut? Only on the kitchen table? Can you baby gate off a section of the living room? \n\nIt is not your 7 year old's responsibility to protect your toddler, that is your husband and your job. You need to figure out how to keep them safe without going nuclear on your daughter's passion. \n\nAlso you will severely regret when she no longer is able to entertain herself for hours doing her art because you threw it out.", "YTA.\n\nThe 2.5 year old needed to be better supervised. The fact she put the lid in her mouth is barely related to the supplies. Toddlers put stuff in their mouth constantly, and running around and falling is what caused her to choke.\n\nYes 7 year old needs to clean up better, but is also a kid and had no malicious intention here. \n\nEase down, Momma Bear.", "YTA, the issue is your husbands lack of parenting the baby that needs to supervision.

I have grands about the same age and it's repetition. When we're done with the paints we put the tops back on, crayons go back in the box so the dogs are not rainbow pooping, etc.. They're complimented for doing it and are at the point they just need prompting. They learn by repeating and positive reinforcement, not threats and punishment.

How hard can it be to tell her to pick up when she is finished? So you are essentially punishing your daughter for being a 7 year old forgetful kid and you are giving your husband, who you made two living beings with, a pass for being unobservant. YTA.", "So your 7 yo old is solely responsible for the safety of their sibling? That's what it sounds like, and yep, that's a major a-hole move. What have you guys tried to help her remember to tidy up? Are there bins? Is there a system? It's especially worse since you're throwing out irreplaceable items that both kids get to enjoy. Effective parenting means teaching and re-enforcing good habits, maybe she can learn them at the same time as her dad?", "YTA you have two children with needs. You can find a way to meet them both. My nanny threw out everything on my floor when I was around that age. It did not teach me to be more tidy, I learned that much later when I learned how systems work. It did however teach me that I was not understood or valued unless i fit their mold. No one taught me how to clean or implemented habits, patterns or systems that helped me be tidy. Address the issue not the symptom. Before she leaves the area, she must clean up, with any activity. This is something you stay on them about until it becomes habit. I\u2019m sure she was scared about her sibling, that is a natural consequence. But you throwing all her joy and talent supplies away is you overreacting and not wanting to do the hard work. How about working with the toddler \u201cnot for babies\u201d my daughter was never told no, we explained why it wasn\u2019t for babies and gave her something appropriate in exchange.

He needs to step up, be a parent and keep the choking hazards away from the 2yo. The 7yo is not the responsible party.", "YWBTA. \n\nWow. She\u2019s 7. How about you take a parenting class and learn about age-appropriate expectations.\n\nAnd while you\u2019re doing that, develop a safe storage place and rules about art relating to times and parental supervision instead of adopting an arbitrary, draconic, and traumatic response. \n\nI mean, damn.", "Your husband is the parent.

Read some child development books and find which level your husband is on.", "Let me see if I have this straight.  You are making your seven year old responsible for the safety of your two year old?\n\nYes, by all means, explain to the seven year old what a choking hazard is.  Explain why it is important that she keep the art supplies that are choking hazards away.  Enlist her help in keeping people safe; empower her!\n\nOf course, a seven year old isn\u2019t an adult.  They forget.  They get distracted.  That means you revisit and reinforce the safety message.\n\nNow, to the adults.  You and your partner both suck.  Your partner allows safety hazards to be unmitigated.  And doesn\u2019t really watch a toddler. And the choking could well happen while the artist daughter is appropriately using her materials.  Or the choking could happen anywhere else in the house.\n\nYour response?  I will take away the thing my daughter cherishes most because, shoulder shrug, I can\u2019t be bothered to explain child safety to my partner.  Who, you know, is actually the adult responsible for safety.  He gets off because, what can I do?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. \nWhile i agree that she does need to learn responsibility, she is only 7 do there will definitely be some irresponsibility from  her. I would suggest having a designated area for her art - maybe in her bedroom where the toddler can't easily access. I think trying a different approach is more reasonable than throwing out the thing she loves and enjoys.", "Yes, YWBTA. You can confiscate her supplies instead of throwing them out, and give them back to her once she\u2019s demonstrated more responsibility. Also, tell your husband to parent his kids.", "YTA.

Don't tarnish her passion by using it as punishment.", "YWBTA.\n\nWould it not be easier to simply confiscate left out supplies for a week at a time or something to that degree rather than being wasteful? A week is like a lifetime away when you're that age. I don't think I've ever met a 7yr old who wasn't messy or forgetful, that's normal.\n\nIk you're trying to find *the* solution but I don't think jumping to the extreme is a smart decision.

Definitely not tearing into you here. This is not a fun position for any parent to be in, and what happened must have been quite scary for you guys. You wouldn't be wrong to sit with your art kid and gently-yet-seriously go over what happened and emphasize the risks to her sister.\n\nThat said, taking away her things just punishes her -- a small child who is constantly having new things crammed into her rapidly developing brain and whose skills and executive function and ability to adequately prioritize safety and thoughtfulness are nowhere near done developing -- for what is actually parental negligence. What happened wasn't your art kid's fault. This was on your husband, who was there and should have been on alert for it in the first place as the trade-off for him having a lenient take on what your toddler should have access to. Punishing your older kid isn't going to make him step up. It may also risk her developing resentment against the younger child, too, since technically, she was the one with the grabby hands in the first place. Your older child has valid reasons to not be there yet with the organization and tidiness. Your husband, not so much. Please don't start down the path of parentifying your older child and punishing them for something her parents need to be accountable for.

She is one of those rare children who can be sat down in front of some paper or a colouring book, and keep herself amused for, literally, hours. She was given some really nice art supplies for her birthday, and has been really enjoying using them. Her 2.5 year old sister also loves art and drawing.\n\nUnfortunately, Ms. 7 is also somewhat absent minded, and has a habit of leaving her drawing supplies all over the coffee table and the living room floor. We have been frequently reminding her to pick them up; and while she will do it if prompted, it's often forgotten about or not clearly noticed (their father stays home and I work full time; he's not the most observant person when it comes to mess and clutter, and my day is so packed with work, child care and other domestic stuff, I don't get a chance to go into the living room some days).\n\nI have repeatedly told her that her art material is her responsibility, and she needs to make sure it isn't left out where her sister can access it. However, she doesn't mind sharing them with her sister, and her sister is reasonably good about limiting her drawing to paper (ie not furniture or walls). I don't like the 2.5 year old being allowed to play with the textas as I worry about the choking hazards, but as I'm not home all the time, and my husband thinks the toddler is old enough to play with them and isn't prepared to enforce rules that he doesn't think are necessary, I don't make a huge fuss about it.\n\nThe 2.5 year old today (after an argument) put a texta lid in her mouth that her sister had left lying around, ran off, tripped and inhaled the lid.\n\nLuckily, her father was able to get it out before any harm was done and she wasn't hurt, but she could have died.\n\nFor me, this is the final straw. If I can't enforce rules to keep my younger daughter safe when I'm not there, I feel like I have no choice but to eliminate the hazard. \n\nWhen my daughter gets home from school, I'm going to tell her that any art supplies other than pencils and paper I find that aren't put out of the 2.5 year olds reach are going straight in the bin. No more reminders, no more warnings.\n\nI know how much these mean to her - and we couldn't afford to replace anything that gets thrown out - but I just don't feel like I would be able to keep her sister safe otherwise.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I throw out any choking hazards left within the reach of the toddler?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why did YOU allow your 7 year old to use art supplies in a space accessible to a 2.5 year old?  Why did YOU fail to check on 7 year old and ensure the supplies were cleaned up or out of reach?  I can\u2019t believe you are so dense as to not know you are an asshole.

Plus, OP is giving her a final warning when she returns so it\u2019s not like the supplies will be in the trash and gone when the kid comes home.", "No but how is it the 7 year olds fault who apparently can\u2019t have art supplies now? She\u2019s the one being made to be a failure by mom.", "Bahahahaha! A mistake. Nah. She said that he was totally cool with 2 yr old grabbing things and didn\u2019t think they\u2019re a choking hazard. She can\u2019t be bothered to deal with him so she\u2019s punishing the 7 yr old. \n\nIt was no mistake.", "He's more responsible for this than a 7 year old child. Thanks", "Well, they have a 7yo daughter who somehow hasn't swallowed a lethal object eventhough his father propably didn't supervise her 24/7 with either security cameras or eyes. Kids tastes things as soon as they have a chance, I think that happens _quite_ a lot.\n\nIs the 7yo expected to always collect her staff eventhough she could be off from her drawings for like 15minutes to come back?", "Please never reproduce", "It isn't her fault, and atleast shouldn't be taken away the art supplies. I do agree that it was the husbands faults but I rarely hear anyone taking a divorce over one that kind mistake. I think 2yos are putting something in their mouths constantly.", "They still somehow have an alive 7yo there, so I quess he has done something right.", "I truly hope that is clear for everyone.", "Just because one child did fine with less supervision doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe. Or advisable. Choking hazards are still choking hazards and should be handled with supervision. If the 7 year old was fine sitting by the pool without diving in as a toddler would you be suggesting the 2.5 year old be allowed around the pool unsupervised? No, because that\u2019s a crazy dangerous, unnecessary risk. So are things kids can choke on.\n\nAnd btw there\u2019s no info in the post as to whether or not the father was a sahp when the 7 year old was a toddler.", "I hope you don\u2019t either, cause your offspring will surely turn out either entitled or dead cause they choked on something that should have been put away", "By the adult. Sheesh!"]}
