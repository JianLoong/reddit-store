Especially when Grandma thinks he's disrespectful.", "If she did she wouldn't be posting this.", "Agreed.  On AITA I try to limit my judgment to what is being asked in the title question, in this case whether OP is AH for not going on the trip.\n\nMost OPs throw in a lot of other information which can get a different response.

The fact that you feel it is and have mentioned they never accept any of your partners at 29 years old leads me to believe your relationships are typically fairly short. That's ok, but it is different than your siblings, who have been with the same people for years. Have your partners and you lived together? Discussed marriage in the future? Do you share finances? Are you planning your future lives together about things like buying a home, retirement plans, etc? If some opportunity came, say for a huge job opportunity, would it be assumed you were moving to a new location together, or would you have to ask each other \"what are we\" type questions?\n\nI'm not saying you need to do any of that at all right now, but there's a huge difference between casually dating someone for a year or two because you like their company and planning a whole future with someone in a serious and long-term relationship. Some of it is about the time, sure, but even if you've seen someone on the weekends for 5 years but maintained separate lives, is it really a serious relationship? There's nuance. Your family has a right to not feel as though your boyfriend of almost a year is family to them. We aren't talking about your husband or the man you've lived with for 5 years. It's a reasonable time frame for them to still have reservations.\n\nSo it's your right not to go, and you're not an asshole for feeling as you do. Your family also aren't assholes for not being ready to accept him into the fold. Being invited to the family vacation is a big step, and it really can't be rushed. I think you may be reading into or overreacting based on the info here, but I don't think it makes you an asshole as much as just not seeing it from a more neutral perspective.", "This also might be also be a respect thing. You say yourself you never taught him anything about your culture. And 1 year is not the same as 4 or 5 years....", "NTA. If you don't want to go, don't go.

Yeah, you're in a committed relationship and one of some duration (I can understand calling it long term but am personally of the opinion the first year is when your brain is making shit rainbows) but there is a difference between 1 year and 4/5 years.

Usually skin color.  Honestly, I'm doubtful that's the case because A- your brother has a BF and they're okay with it and B- your brother's boyfriend is Thai, not Korean, and they're also okay with that.

He is nice and kind to them--in ways that are acceptable in the culture he grew up in.  Hell, it translates partly into the Korean culture you don't have interest in nor really engage in.  HOWEVER, there ARE cultural differences that lead to certain things being rude in one culture but acceptable--or not thought of--in the other.   His being ignorant of them (because YOU didn't think it was important) does not magically make it no longer rude.  You have no interest in your ethnic culture?  Fine.

You are the one who decided it wasn't important for him to know about it--even though it was important and clearly affect (because yes, manners do matter) the way he and your family develop their relationship.  You may not view it as disrespectful because it's not considered so in the culture you choose to embrace and the culture he knows but your grandmother sure as hell feels disrespected.\n\nYou may not your Korean heritage is important but you knew it was important to your mother and grandmother.  He's important to you so you want him to be/feel accepted and included in your family.

Your grandmother says he has been disrespectful.  Given the different cultural aspects both sides are coming from, both statements can be true.  Also true?

Otherwise, why set multiple people up to fail with her family when a simple, \"hey, just a heads up, but my family's customs are a little different, so be careful\" would at least set the partner in a \"be alert, reactive and gracious\" mindset, even if they aren't fully aware of whatever faux pas they may be committing.", "OP commented that because she hasn\u2019t told the boyfriend about her culture, he does things that are rude/insensitive to the parents without realizing.

This is just a consequence of dating someone that grew up in a different culture.

You didn't tell your bf about what is proper in their culture, which may be forgiveable in a family setting, but not if you are actually going to Korea with him.

Parents actually do, in that case, need to adapt their standards more because that would be a perfectly reasonable thing and visiting OP's family, they need to expect certain things. \n\nThey absolutely don't need to take OP's bf, but OP sitting out is also perfectly reasonable. It will, for starters, be extremely awkward to be the only \"single\" sibling on the trip, so that doesn't seem to have been thought through well at all.

It may be because you are so western and not interested in meshing with their old country habits. You may also be shooting yourself (and your bfs) in the foot by limiting their interactions. The only way to build close feelings is to share time and experiences together. Your parents may talk about your bfs in Korean (which is their poor behavior to own), but all you can do is foster the opportunities for relationships to grow.

The family's once-in-decades trip being dampened to accommodate you after you insisted on both of you being there?\n\nFrankly, if you really want to go there, meet family, and share the experience, then go without your bf. If you find yourself developing more of a relationship to your Korean family and heritage, that's great. If you don't, at least you tried... and your family is only out the money they spent taking you on the trip.\n\nI'm not addressing the idea of you and bf paying for his trip and for accommodations for you because I think you said you can't afford it.
