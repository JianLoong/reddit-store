I wonder if there\u2019s more to the story about his exposure to Korean custom because how I\u2019m reading is it\u2019s not that he\u2019s had less time to learn but that you\u2019re specifically not filling him in on your family\u2019s expectations and culture because you don\u2019t personally feel connected or interested in it.

How often does your family see your bf? Are you bringing him to visit your parents often? How serious is your relationship and have you communicated how serious it is to your family?

Ultimately in my mind it comes down to the just over a year thing. I personally see this as too short to consider your significant other a requirement on a family vacation. I can totally understand people thinking the opposite. Now I also think whether he is paying his way or not makes a big difference. If he would pay for his own flight hotel and food then maybe that would shift things.

Your parents probably think it's likely they'll be longterm and marry, so they see them as closer to family. If you've dated more casually and brought multiple people home over the years to meet them it makes perfect sense that they would see your relationships as more casual/short term/less serious, at least until you've been together awhile longer than a year.
