If they expect her to act a certain way when she is around them, I don't see where they are respecting her choices.  They have that right, just as she has a right to live her life as she sees fit.  So, she's still NTA.", "That stuck out to me to, which for me signaled that OP really dropped the ball here with introducing her BF to her parents. I don't think it's racial at all, it's about respect. OP doesn't respect her culture enough to coach her partner, and in turn partner has been disrespectful. Her parents can see he doesn't care, which is due to OP not caring. So why should they pay for him to visit their home country?", "op left it out of the post but mentioned in some comments that her family are paying", "nope. he **would** have an idea if you told him. you chose to make him look like a disrespectful idiot to them, and now you're upset that they see him as a disrespectful idiot and don't like him. it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that you did this purposefully and knew exactly how it would play out.", "Did you never think to... Oh idk.. teach him those basic manners?", "May I ask why you didn't warn him about these things? Frankly, I feel like you've set your boyfriend up for failure with your family and that's really not fair to him at all. While I get that your culture isn't especially important to you and that's absolutely a valid way to feel, you clearly know what your family's expectations are and know what things would upset them and come off as rude or disrespectful to them. \n\nRight now your boyfriend is basically... trying to play a game that he has no understanding of. He doesn't know the rules and what's expected of him, so he's never going to be successful at it. \n\nMy partner and I are both white, but we have *very* different family cultures and there are major class differences as well. Before they met my circle (not so much my parents because they're chill af), I absolutely let them know about some expectations that they wouldn't have anticipated and they did the same for me before introducing me to their family. It helped smoothed things along SO much and I just can't imagine not setting my partner up for success like that.", "It sure seems the OP feels like this is about culture and her decision to not embrace Korean culture like her siblings have.   She also feels it is about race since her bf is white.  She consciously made the decision not to school her boyfriends on Korean culture.  Again, it's not something that interests her.  This displeases her parents.  BTW - She's not stopping her parents or siblings/partners from going on the trip, nor does it seem like she has given them any ultimatum.  She's living her life as she wants.   She's NTA.", "Fair.  OP is totally fine to decline the invitation.  IMO she's an asshole for the pushing (and for setting up her boyfriend for failure).

The fact that you feel it is and have mentioned they never accept any of your partners at 29 years old leads me to believe your relationships are typically fairly short. That's ok, but it is different than your siblings, who have been with the same people for years. Have your partners and you lived together? Discussed marriage in the future? Do you share finances? Are you planning your future lives together about things like buying a home, retirement plans, etc? If some opportunity came, say for a huge job opportunity, would it be assumed you were moving to a new location together, or would you have to ask each other \"what are we\" type questions?\n\nI'm not saying you need to do any of that at all right now, but there's a huge difference between casually dating someone for a year or two because you like their company and planning a whole future with someone in a serious and long-term relationship. Some of it is about the time, sure, but even if you've seen someone on the weekends for 5 years but maintained separate lives, is it really a serious relationship? There's nuance. Your family has a right to not feel as though your boyfriend of almost a year is family to them. We aren't talking about your husband or the man you've lived with for 5 years. It's a reasonable time frame for them to still have reservations.\n\nSo it's your right not to go, and you're not an asshole for feeling as you do. Your family also aren't assholes for not being ready to accept him into the fold. Being invited to the family vacation is a big step, and it really can't be rushed. I think you may be reading into or overreacting based on the info here, but I don't think it makes you an asshole as much as just not seeing it from a more neutral perspective.", "This also might be also be a respect thing.

Yeah, you're in a committed relationship and one of some duration (I can understand calling it long term but am personally of the opinion the first year is when your brain is making shit rainbows) but there is a difference between 1 year and 4/5 years.

Usually skin color.  Honestly, I'm doubtful that's the case because A- your brother has a BF and they're okay with it and B- your brother's boyfriend is Thai, not Korean, and they're also okay with that.

HOWEVER, there ARE cultural differences that lead to certain things being rude in one culture but acceptable--or not thought of--in the other.   His being ignorant of them (because YOU didn't think it was important) does not magically make it no longer rude.  You have no interest in your ethnic culture?  Fine.

You are the one who decided it wasn't important for him to know about it--even though it was important and clearly affect (because yes, manners do matter) the way he and your family develop their relationship.  You may not view it as disrespectful because it's not considered so in the culture you choose to embrace and the culture he knows but your grandmother sure as hell feels disrespected.\n\nYou may not your Korean heritage is important but you knew it was important to your mother and grandmother.

Your grandmother says he has been disrespectful.  Given the different cultural aspects both sides are coming from, both statements can be true.  Also true?

Otherwise, why set multiple people up to fail with her family when a simple, \"hey, just a heads up, but my family's customs are a little different, so be careful\" would at least set the partner in a \"be alert, reactive and gracious\" mindset, even if they aren't fully aware of whatever faux pas they may be committing.", "OP commented that because she hasn\u2019t told the boyfriend about her culture, he does things that are rude/insensitive to the parents without realizing.

You're NOT entitled to this trip, neither entitled to your parents money and is not okay to guilt trip them to pay for that dude vacation. Besides both of you are near your *30's* so you should be able to pay for him.", "When I was in my late twenties, a year in a relationship was an eyeblink.", "It may be the start of long term but it\u2019s certainly not what I\u2019d consider \u201cinvite on family vacation\u201d term", "It\u2019s not racism, it\u2019s discrimination.", "The ugly reality is that this woman spread a lie about you and your wife.", "OP said this is the first vacation like this", "It\u2019s crazy how everyone is taught the beef Asian countries had with one another and still think they all identify as one \u201cgroup\u201d.", "Yeah, but that's also not on him because it sounds like no one is actually correcting him, and he is not rude by the standards of where they currently live. That kind of brings it back to the racism factor- they should be aware it's not intentional, but will hold it against him for having a different background anyway. He actually hasn't been given a chance to live up to his gf's family's standards because no one is saying what they are to him", "As pointed out, a year at 29 can be different than a year at 21. People tend to be a bit more settled and know more of what they want a bit older.\n\nThe bigger thing is they are implying OP's relationship isn't as serious as siblings. Which is a bit judge-y.\n\nOP is NTA because she is in her rights to refuse an invitation to the vacation. Not going is acceptable, especially if she feels it's because her partner is going to be less accepted overall in the future. If they do go the marriage route, this is only going to get more awkward", "This", "He can't care about what he doesn't know is the problem. I don't think it can be said he doesn't care, more OP doesn't. And parents should likely be aware of that if they know OP. So it is actually backwards to hold that against bf.", "So you set him up to fail!! Why would you do that?\n\nYour best chance of salvaging things is to explain that your bf didn\u2019t know better and to apologize to your family for not teaching him, and then let him know how to act around your family next time. He can come over and act respectfully and they\u2019ll probably start liking him more.", "Including OP apparently. She either really doesn't know anything about her family's culture or this is some fake nonsense.", "A long term is long term. At 29, a year long relationship has way better chances to become forever then at 21. If anything the one at 21 is more likely to be less serious.", "But that's basically what I mean. I can only infer from the OP, but I don't blame him not knowing/caring on him, I blame OP. She's gonna set the tone, and if she doesn't care about the culture, he's got no reason to. \n\nBut regarding the parents, if I were them I'd still be pissed because he's a grown man, he could always do his own research, or ask himself. And I wouldn't want to waste my money on paying for a trip for someone who can't be bothered to learn the basics", "It's also an invitation, not a summons, so OP not going is acceptable anyway. Parents also created an awkward dynamic if OP is going to be the only solo sibling there, which kinda makes it less justifiable. At least offer to let bf come along and pay his own way or something at that point", "Except it sounds like they've been living in their current country for a while, and daughter doesn't follow the traditions, so why would he assume it's going to be exactly the same? Very realistically, it's likely the family's culture is a bit of a hybrid culture as is.\n\nThey do need to get it sorted on a larger level because if OP does marry current bf, then it's very likely their household will be run in the cultural norms of the country they are in, including with any children they have. Parents actually do, in that case, need to adapt their standards more because that would be a perfectly reasonable thing and visiting OP's family, they need to expect certain things. \n\nThey absolutely don't need to take OP's bf, but OP sitting out is also perfectly reasonable. It will, for starters, be extremely awkward to be the only \"single\" sibling on the trip, so that doesn't seem to have been thought through well at all. Add in OP does feel generally more removed from the culture, and it's easier for her to say no, something I don't think Parents considered here."]}
