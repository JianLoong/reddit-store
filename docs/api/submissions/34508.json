I decided to bring her to my apartment to let her rest because she is one of 6 kids at home and her house is loud, not a good place for recovering from chemo. \n\nWhen we got to my apartment I woke her up, brought her to the couch, and brought her some blankets. She was very appreciative of me letting her stay at my apartment.\n\nThe thing is, my mom is staying with us and she was supposed to be sleeping on the couch.

And didn't tell her? And then madr her sleep on an air mattress instead (depends on the couch but 90% of the time a couch is more comfortable)? And the friend already has a bed and place to stay but you decided she would be more comfortable at your place, a decision you made for her while she was asleep?\n\nOf course YTA. A well meaning one, but your mom obviiously has reason to be annoyed.", "This is kind of a weird post.\n\nYou forgot your mom was staying with you? On the couch? I can\u2019t really see that slipping your mind.\n\nThe correct way to handle this would have been to get Phoebe somewhere comfortable (on the couch) and proactively get an air mattress for your mom and inform your mom of what\u2019s going on. I would imagine she would have been a lot more understanding as opposed to getting back late night as an invited guest in your house to find out she has nowhere to sleep.\n\nI\u2019m refraining from judgement overall, but to appease, YTA for forgetting your mom is staying with you entirely.", "YTA, light. You did a really nice thing for your friend, but you did give away the (presumably comfortable) bed you'd promised to your mother. She has every right to be annoyed. You don't mention when she found Phoebe (was it late, for example?), but it's understandable why she would be disconcerted to find herself displaced.", "How did you forget your mom was staying with you?", "Hi. Around age 50 was when I really stopped being able to sleep on an air mattress. If that's the only alternative I had, I literally would have had to leave and go home or to a hotel. How did you forget your mom was staying with you? YTA", "If you had existing plans with your mother, then yes - you're in the wrong. Phoebe has a home and her own bed and at no point did she ask to sleep on your couch...she asked for a lift.\n\nAir mattresses are hell to sleep on in general... especially cheaper ones. Your mother being older may have additional back/joint issues which would make it worse.\n\nIt's not the end of the world but yeah, you're in the wrong.", "YTA - aside from anything else, if I were Phoebe, I\u2019d probably feel awful knowing that I\u2019d displaced your mother. \n\nI\u2019d also feel very weird about you unilaterally changing plans without consulting me. Sure she was grateful in this instance, but what if she\u2019d have preferred to recover in a familiar place  surrounded by family?\n\nI\u2019m sure you meant well, but this whole thing seems very strange.", "Of course YTA. You gave away your mother\u2019s bed (couch) to someone else and then gave her a less comfortable alternative. \n\nI can completely understand how it happened and it was very nice of you to help your friend out, but it was still a dick move to your mum.", "YTA\n\n\n\nYou could have given them your bed.", "YTA - it was nice of you to drive your friend but at \nwhat point was it your decision to assume she should sleep at your house? She\u2019s 19, you\u2019re 30. She has a home and a bed and you decided your place is better than the comfort of her own bed and home. \nAnd if she was there at five and napped she still could have gone home at nine leaving the previously promised couch to your mom. \nThis is all so weird and presumptive and rude.", "YTA. At least put up your mom in a hotel or something for the night, making an older woman sleep on an air mattress could cause back, neck, hip pain.

You gave your couch to a friend who was exhausted from chemo and needed a quiet place to sleep. And you found a way to also accommodate your mother.

No.\n\nI give her the benefit of the doubt though that she was understanding of the situation after you explained it.\n\nAnd I give you the benefit of the doubt that you usually are reliable. Therefore none of you are AH.", "Soft YTA as you did not do it with ill intentions. \n\nWhen you invite people over, even if it is \"just mom\", your duty is to ensure they are comfortable. \n\nYour mom accepted the invitation knowing she would sleep in the couch, you blindside her and changed her rest place to a more uncomfortable one,  prioritizing what you thought would be a better fit for your friend. \n\nNext time OP, give your mom or Phoebe the bed, the other the couch and you use the air mattress, you are the host.", "Tell your mum to get over it", "NTA, you helped a friend in need and forgot that your mom already had the couch. That's an accident and you didn't do it on purpose. The moment she pointed it out you fixed the situation and got an air mattress and extra blankets.\n\nNow, your mom is still right to be mad that you didn't ask her and you should probably apologize to her for forgetting about that.\n\nSo I think your husband summarized it pretty well, we get why you did it and we get why she is upset. But overlooking something and then fixing it the once it gets pointed out to you does not make you an asshole from my point of view. And for example I would have said that YTA if you hadn't forgotten about it and had instead disregarded your mother on purpose.\n\nBesides that I'd take an air mattress over the couch any day, sounds like an upgrade for your mother.", "NAH. I get why your mom was upset, but you (with the help of your husband) fixed the situation. So no real ah here.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think your TA. I think from what your saying it was an honest mistake. I think texting your mum, apologising and maybe waking your friend up to move her to the air mattress if your mum was more comfortable on the couch was the best option. Surely your mum can understand you where just being kind to someone who\u2019s life is literally dependant on chemicals that are killing get.", "YTA, and I'm confused you had to ask. Phoebe is recovering at home every time, why would it have to be different now? Also why did you not offer to share the bed with Phoebe or your mum and your husband taking the air mattress?", "NTA...as long as you provided your mom a place to sleep, there is no reason she should be upset.  The poor girl is dealing with cancer.  It's sad your mom isn't as compassionate as you.", "NTA. Your moms feelings got hurt, fine. But, tbh it is not like she slept on the floor. She should be proud of the kind/sensible women she raised and not jealous of a 19 yo that just had chemotherapy and felt sickly/tired.", "I wonder sometimes at peoples families and friends,  in how so often in the narrative in AITA is \"the family is split down the middle\". \"5 of my friends see one side. and 5 see the other side\". or \"spouse/sibling/BFF/whatever sees both sides\".  It both amazes and puzzles  me how so many stories' OPs have such division amongst their social circles.

The issue was not informing. OP should've told her mom beforehand that she wanted to change the accommodation plans.", "I know right!", "No, to be offended that someone who has their own bed nearby has displaced you from your accommodation.", "How does it make it worse? It's much better to realize it on the afternoon while you still have the to fix it", "OP's mom is likely in her 50s or older. People of that age have back issues and other health problems that can make it difficult to sleep on air mattress. We don't know what are mother's reasons for wanting to sleep on the couch.\n\nWe know that OP invited mother over and promised her that she will have couch available for her. Then she went back on her word at the last moment and unilaterally decided for Phoebe and mother where they'll sleep.\n\nOp let her mom know quite late and depending on her travelling and financial options she was probably stuck. Not everyone can afford a hotel if they don't expect it.\n\nPhoebe has a home she can go to and rest, it wasn't even her idea to stay over, but OP just decided on her behalf. If OP wanted to have Phoebe over she could've invited her any other time her mom wasn't there.", "Wait for op's husband to get home with the air mattress...", "Curl up on the floor obviously!\n\n/s", "OK and? The girl just had chemo and got abandoned by her original ride. I dont want selfish people in my house who cant have empathy. It is my space and I do get to dictate how it gets used because I pay the bills. If my mother doesn't like it she knows where her home is and she can make the rules there."]}
