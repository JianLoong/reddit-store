During my second semester, I met Phoebe (19). We were taking 2 classes together and we clicked immediately. We have a lot of the same interests and she\u2019s just such a kind and smart girl. \n\nPhoebe was diagnosed with cancer over the summer. She spent a few months in the hospital and now goes for outpatient chemo every couple weeks. \n\nOn Thursday Phoebe called me and said her grandpa was supposed to drive her to chemo but he never showed up and asked if I could take her. \n\nAfter her chemo she fell asleep in the car. I decided to bring her to my apartment to let her rest because she is one of 6 kids at home and her house is loud, not a good place for recovering from chemo. \n\nWhen we got to my apartment I woke her up, brought her to the couch, and brought her some blankets. She was very appreciative of me letting her stay at my apartment.\n\nThe thing is, my mom is staying with us and she was supposed to be sleeping on the couch. It totally slipped my mind when I brought Phoebe home. \n\nMy mom got back and asked why Phoebe was here when she saw her sleeping on the couch. I explained the situation and she said it was rude of me to give up the couch without asking her. \n\nI called my husband, explained the situation, and he picked up an air mattress and extra blankets for my mom but she\u2019s still mad that I gave away the couch for the night (I took Phoebe home Friday afternoon). My husband says he gets why I did it but he gets why she is upset. \n\nAITA for giving my friend the couch when my mom was staying with us?\n\nEdit: I was told to add this to the post but Phoebe\u2019s family couldn\u2019t care less that she\u2019s sick. They didn\u2019t visit her in the hospital, they don\u2019t take her to appointments unless they\u2019re not working, they don\u2019t have plans, and they feel like going, and they don\u2019t make her siblings let her rest. She asked her mom if she was taking her to get a procedure done and her mom told her they can\u2019t put their lives on hold just because she\u2019s sick again. \n\nThis part wasn\u2019t in the comment but she shares a room with her 13 year old sister and her sister constantly has friends over and they hang out in her room. Phoebe has come over so she could take a nap on the couch before because she can\u2019t rest at home.

And didn't tell her? And then madr her sleep on an air mattress instead (depends on the couch but 90% of the time a couch is more comfortable)? And the friend already has a bed and place to stay but you decided she would be more comfortable at your place, a decision you made for her while she was asleep?\n\nOf course YTA. A well meaning one, but your mom obviiously has reason to be annoyed.", "This is kind of a weird post.\n\nYou forgot your mom was staying with you? On the couch? I can\u2019t really see that slipping your mind.\n\nThe correct way to handle this would have been to get Phoebe somewhere comfortable (on the couch) and proactively get an air mattress for your mom and inform your mom of what\u2019s going on. I would imagine she would have been a lot more understanding as opposed to getting back late night as an invited guest in your house to find out she has nowhere to sleep.\n\nI\u2019m refraining from judgement overall, but to appease, YTA for forgetting your mom is staying with you entirely.", "YTA, light. You did a really nice thing for your friend, but you did give away the (presumably comfortable) bed you'd promised to your mother. She has every right to be annoyed.

Phoebe has a home and her own bed and at no point did she ask to sleep on your couch...she asked for a lift.\n\nAir mattresses are hell to sleep on in general... especially cheaper ones. Your mother being older may have additional back/joint issues which would make it worse.\n\nIt's not the end of the world but yeah, you're in the wrong.", "YTA - aside from anything else, if I were Phoebe, I\u2019d probably feel awful knowing that I\u2019d displaced your mother. \n\nI\u2019d also feel very weird about you unilaterally changing plans without consulting me. Sure she was grateful in this instance, but what if she\u2019d have preferred to recover in a familiar place  surrounded by family?\n\nI\u2019m sure you meant well, but this whole thing seems very strange.", "Of course YTA. You gave away your mother\u2019s bed (couch) to someone else and then gave her a less comfortable alternative. \n\nI can completely understand how it happened and it was very nice of you to help your friend out, but it was still a dick move to your mum.", "YTA\n\n\n\nYou could have given them your bed.", "YTA - it was nice of you to drive your friend but at \nwhat point was it your decision to assume she should sleep at your house? She\u2019s 19, you\u2019re 30. She has a home and a bed and you decided your place is better than the comfort of her own bed and home. \nAnd if she was there at five and napped she still could have gone home at nine leaving the previously promised couch to your mom. \nThis is all so weird and presumptive and rude.", "YTA. At least put up your mom in a hotel or something for the night, making an older woman sleep on an air mattress could cause back, neck, hip pain.

You gave your couch to a friend who was exhausted from chemo and needed a quiet place to sleep. And you found a way to also accommodate your mother.

No.\n\nI give her the benefit of the doubt though that she was understanding of the situation after you explained it.\n\nAnd I give you the benefit of the doubt that you usually are reliable. Therefore none of you are AH.", "Soft YTA as you did not do it with ill intentions. \n\nWhen you invite people over, even if it is \"just mom\", your duty is to ensure they are comfortable. \n\nYour mom accepted the invitation knowing she would sleep in the couch, you blindside her and changed her rest place to a more uncomfortable one,  prioritizing what you thought would be a better fit for your friend. \n\nNext time OP, give your mom or Phoebe the bed, the other the couch and you use the air mattress, you are the host.", "Tell your mum to get over it", "NTA, you helped a friend in need and forgot that your mom already had the couch. That's an accident and you didn't do it on purpose. The moment she pointed it out you fixed the situation and got an air mattress and extra blankets.\n\nNow, your mom is still right to be mad that you didn't ask her and you should probably apologize to her for forgetting about that.\n\nSo I think your husband summarized it pretty well, we get why you did it and we get why she is upset. But overlooking something and then fixing it the once it gets pointed out to you does not make you an asshole from my point of view.

I get why your mom was upset, but you (with the help of your husband) fixed the situation. So no real ah here.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think your TA. I think from what your saying it was an honest mistake.

The poor girl is dealing with cancer.  It's sad your mom isn't as compassionate as you.", "NTA. Your moms feelings got hurt, fine. But, tbh it is not like she slept on the floor. She should be proud of the kind/sensible women she raised and not jealous of a 19 yo that just had chemotherapy and felt sickly/tired.", "I wonder sometimes at peoples families and friends,  in how so often in the narrative in AITA is \"the family is split down the middle\". \"5 of my friends see one side. and 5 see the other side\". or \"spouse/sibling/BFF/whatever sees both sides\".

But she gave away her mom's place to rest and then made her old mom sleep on the floor. That's not really charitable actually?

OP gave this child a ride (yes child) and they fell asleep after undergoing chemotherapy. *Pause to let the gravity of what that must be like for that child.* And OP thought it'd be nice for her friend to get some rest and not have 6 kids running around while she needs to rest. Even if OP didn't forget her mother was staying with her, OP wasn't aware her friend would sleep all night.

Does sleeping on the communal couch mean that you own the rights to the couch all day and night? OPs mom doesn't get to decide the sleeping arrangements or who else gets to stay the night at OPs house. And she's not just some guest she's hosting, it's her mother, it's completely different, and don't act like it isn't. Not saying that means be disrespectful to her, but when OP realized her friend wasn't going to wake up (and she should get her rest), she got her mom situated so that she could be comfortable.

Because if I were to do this, my mom would have seen my friend on the couch and she would have initially asked if my friend was ok.

That doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be friends, but when you factor in the fact that OP made a unilateral decision for phoebe when she was in a vulnerable position, it becomes icky.

The respectful thing to do is (1) remember you invited a guest, (2) inform the guest that circumstances have changed, (3) offer the guest an alternative, as far in advance as possible. All of this is where OP fucked up because (1) she forgot she'd agreed to let her mon stay with her, (2) because of (1), she forgot to tell mom ahead of time circumstances have changed, and (3) when mom showed up it didn't even occur to her then to immediately offer her bed or an air mattress as an alternative; mom had to be visibly upset before OP thought to do so\n\nYTA here", "This is entirely dependent on the air mattress. I have slept on very comfortable, expensive air mattresses, but the majority sold at big box stores are downright awful.

They\u2019re assuming because OP said she lives in a loud and hectic place, that her family must not care about her. Very chronically online to assume that just because someone has a loud family it means they wouldn\u2019t care to accommodate them after an intense medical treatment.~~\n\nEDITING TO ADD: Tbh I can\u2019t believe OP left all of that info out of the original post. It changes things a lot.\n\nIn this case, I still think OP is a little bit of TA for treating her mom as an afterthought, but I see now that it was more necessary for phoebe to be there than I originally thought.

Maybe it\u2019s more so the emotional hurt of being an afterthought or nuisance to OP instead of a valued guest with a set accommodation. Maybe it\u2019s a combination of both. We all like to say \u201cwell she doesn\u2019t have cancer so she can shut the fuck up\u201d but the truth is she\u2019s still entitled to being upset, and I can see that upset being directed at OP. Phoebe is the ultimate loser in this situation, so I don\u2019t think her sleeping on OP\u2019s couch is in any way her fault.

You provided this girl a calm, quiet place to recoup from a very aggressive treatment and a caring environment. Imo, if I were your mom, I certainly would not have minded giving up the couch for a night so she can rest and I would be very proud that I raised such a compassionate kiddo.

I think a lot of people are thinking that you made a decision for Phoebe without her input but from what you\u2019ve shared, she very much consented to stay at your home. While I understand what people are saying as far as Phoebe possibly being used to the noise in her house, that still does not make it ideal because it\u2019s something she\u2019s accustomed to, and she has every right and need to want rest and recover adequately from chemotherapy.

OP is a newish friend, so I'm guessing Phoebe isn't very close with her husband, much less her visiting mother. Plus she's plopped on a couch in a communal room in the home.

About a month before she died we were watching a movie together and she told me how thankful she was that I didn't change how I treated her, I just kept sharing my happiness with her until the end. A lot of cancer patients feel very isolated. Partly because there are people that are just uncomfortable around such serious situations that slowly disappear from your life, and partly because the people that do stay treat you differently. It can be very infantalizing. My grandmother had one other person in her life that treated her like a normal, capable human being. It was her best friend, an old lady we drove with to church every week. \n\nGiven my experience, I'm inclined to say OP is TA for taking the agency away from her friend and making that decision for her when she's probably already dealing with everybody in her life treating her like a child.
