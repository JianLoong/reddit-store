You need to realize he's coping and learning to adjust as well. You said you didn't drive so I assume you lean on him A LOT.  Between my 2 kids I think I went to like 5 appointments total. Only when my wife specifically asked me to come. But most of them I had work. \n\nDo you work or plan to stop working. \nEither is fine but you'll need to realize that if you're going to be a stay at home mom he has alot more stress on him making sure there's enough to go around. He has to know he has enough money, insurance, time. I was lucky my wife realized I was burning the candle at both ends and was burning out trying to be full time worker to maintain a household, full time dad, and full time husband.  Maybe some guys can do it but I couldn't. I needed a break somewhere. But couldn't communicate that. She noticed and helped me. \n\nShe got up on with the kids at night unless I was already up.  \nYou guys are a team now and need to look out for each other. You know he's working crazy hours and needed some sleep. Not wanted. Needed.  What if he fell asleep driving to the appointment?  \n\nYea it's shitty he said he would take you and then backed out.

He isn't perfect and said something thoughtless while half asleep. \n\nyou don't sounds very self sufficient at all which I find worrisome", "NTA. There was no need for him to be rude to you, especially after he agreed to take you. He could have said \"maybe.\" He could have said \"no.\" Also, this seems like an appointment he would want to attend. You found out you were pregnant 8 months ago? This baby is about to arrive any minute. \n\nThis kind of behavior is something to take seriously. There's a lot of sleep deprivation in his future, unless he decides to avoid some parental responsibility. I'd pay attention to how he feels entitled to act when he's tired.\n\nEdit: I see the obligatory \"I know he will be a good dad\" bit. Look, I'm rooting for this new family, but we can't ignore the fact that part of being a good dad is supporting and respecting the other parent. Even if the couple splits, part of being a good parent is not fucking things up, insulting the other parent, or resting and replenishing energy at the expense of the other.", "This isn't about the appointment.\n\nThis is about doing what you say you're going to do and keeping promises.\n\n>I know he\u2019s going to be a good dad to our son\n\nYou sure about that?\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wtf do you mean \"we\". \nBoth of you are 8 months pregnant?", "Soft YTA: it\u2019s the hormones doing this. If he\u2019s only missed 2 appointments in 8 months of pregnancy, that\u2019s pretty good. You\u2019re pregnant, not incapable, and you successfully made it to your appointment.", "NAH, looks like you both need to grow up. Saying you are doing everything alone because of 2 missed appointments and not being able to forgive him ever for that isnt a great way to move forward. Expecting him to miss work because you never learned to drive is ridiculous. He needs to grow up and realize that even after a long day at work, and I understand, my job has call too, hes going to have to wake up and be a parent, no excuses. Ive been called in at midnight after my normal 12 hr shift, worked until 4am and still wake up to take care of the kids at 7a. Its tough, but you both are going to need to buck up", "Ill be the odd man out. Yes you are. You are I am assuming stay at home. That means he is the sole bread winner and he s supporting you. You said he worked long hours. He is busting his ass working and trying. Last night I garuntee he knew he was taking you but after being up so long one you sleep its hard to wake up after that.\n\nHe has missed 2 appointments. 2 while being the only bread winner. \n\nI think it might be he who needs to reevaluate this. You seem extremely needy and irrational. Have you given any consideration to him. Neither of you knew what you were getting into at the beginning. You have both been learning as you go and he has been doing his best. Even you said he had a very long day and are now upset that he crashed and just couldnt get up.\n\nI am assuming you plan to be a stay at home mom which means while he will help considerably. There are going to be times you need to do me so he can function at work and not get fired.", "Babies wake up much earlier than 9am", "NTA but .... this is comparatively easy and he's complaining about being 'on call'?!", "NTA And it\u2019s not your hormones, it\u2019s hard when someone says you can count on them and then you can\u2019t.  You say you feel like you\u2019re doing it all alone, so is this the first time he has refused to come?  And it\u2019s never okay to talk to another person in a way that makes them feel like a burden. I hope he communicates better normally, and this is an outlier.\n\nTrust is the foundation of every relationship and his behavior cost you some trust.  I hope you can rebuild that because you\u2019re going to need it for coparenting.  \n\nFor me pregnancy was way easier than having a newborn when you\u2019re tired and struggling with a steep learning curve and a ton of physical changes. Maybe this is a good time to have a calm conversation about that.  That said, I do feel like my husband and I had a lot of conversations that then went out the window when our kiddo was born.  The default ends up that one parent (in our case me) does most of the caregiving and I think a lot of old patriarchal conditioning comes back and makes a lot of men feel like they don\u2019t have to do as much as their partners.", "NTA for being upset he lashed out at you. That\u2019s unacceptable\n\n\nHave you talked to him about you feeling like you\u2019re doing everything for the baby? From the looks of your comments, he\u2019s go with the flow and you like to plan, so a lot of that resentment might just be due to personality differences. It also sounds like he works an awful lot which might be his way of getting ready for the baby\u2026", "Yikes. Dude needs to take a chill pill and communicate. He should have said the night before that he's been super exhausted and said \" I'm not sure if I'll be able to tomorrow. If I feel upto it I will but otherwise do you think you can take an Uber.\"\n\nHow many hours a week is he working? Are you guys financially stressed? Is there any chance of drug use? Or medications he's on?", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of his work schedule, he made a promise.  Not only when you decided to keep the baby, but just the night before the appointment.\n\nAs the mother you don't have the luxury of deciding to \"skip out\" on being a prospective parent whenever you're tired.\n\nHaving to work is an acceptable excuse.  Wanting to sleep in is not.", " NTA. \nWhile it\u2019s understandable that he was exhausted and didn\u2019t want to wake up early the next morning, he had still agreed to take you the night prior. If he didn\u2019t want to wake up early and be responsible for the task he AGREED to do, he should\u2019ve let you know when you first asked.", "ESH: Reading your comments, it sounds like this is only the second thing he's missed across 8 months. Additionally, you mention that you're alone because he doesn't \"seem stressed,\" but now he finally shows a stress crack you don't like it.\n\nYes, he should've driven you but his reaction is also fair. Just like he doesn't know the stresses you're facing you don't know what he's feeling.", "NTA\n\n\nBeing a parent and partner is a 24/7 thing. You CANT skip the appointment, so why should here? The vast burden of having a family falls on the pregnant partner. Literally the least he can do is get up and get you there.", "NAH but I don\u2019t see any problems with you getting yourself to your appointments. It\u2019s time to grow up and not expect someone to coddle you and hold your hand. If you were in medical distress it would be a different but for routine appointments you should be able to go on your own. He probably shouldn\u2019t have promised to take you when he\u2019s so overworked and you have a right to feel let down. You are going to be a parent so it would be helpful if you could be more self sufficient", "INFO Do you have a job & are you working on finding a way to drive yourself?

He let you down and was a jerk about it too.", "NTA but then again neither is he.  He is exhausted from work.  Its not that he blew you off after gaming all night. If he has been there for you every step of the way minus a few appointments due to work then relax.  Hopefully you can catch him up later today and maybe even enjoy a lunch.", "NTA.

And nowbwith our second he only is takimg off because its bigh risk and he needs to be their during certain consults but just a regular heartbeat blood pressure check zero reason for him to go", "NTA. He agreed to take you and then he flipped this morning. You should have a heart to heart about managing expectations most especially around the final trimester and caring for your newborn. Life happens and it happens whether or not you are on call.", "NTA.\n\nHe agreed to it and he\u2018s just as responsible for all this as are you. We need to stop giving fathers a free pass whilst everything is on the woman regardless. You can\u2018t opt out, and he needs to learn that it\u2018s a 24/7 for him as well!", "ESH - you for the not driving thing. Babies require a lot of appointments so you need to prepare for the fact that you are putting everyone in a horrible position by not being mobile enough to care for yourself and the baby. \n\nShould he have snapped at you? Absolutely not. But driving tired/exhausted can be very dangerous. \n\nWhat happens when he gets called out and you/baby have an appointment?", "Is he going to be a great father, when he cannot take you to an appointment that he voluntarily agreed to participate with you? Just because he works doesn\u2019t give him the right to break a promise. It is that simple. You asked, he said yes, then he slept, leaving you to make last minute arrangements. Are you going to Uber to your delivery?", "NTA since you asked him ahead of time and he agreed to do it. He should have taken you to the appointment. But man the two of you have a lot of growing up to do if you're going to be parents. Both of you. He needs to follow through on his commitments. But you do, too. Are you planning to have a child and never drive? What are you going to do if your boyfriend is working and you need to go somewhere? Do you live in an area with robust public transportation where driving isn't required (like NYC or another big city)? I hope so, if you're planning never to get a driver's license. So, yes, your BF was TA. But both of you need a major reality check.", " E S H. I\u2019m assuming \u201con call\u201d means he\u2019s a doctor or something? Working long and late hours\u2026\n\nHe should not have agreed to do something he couldn\u2019t do, but I think a little empathy is required.\n\nHe\u2019s only missed 2 appointments in 8 months, once out of his control\u2026clearly he\u2019s exhausted and all you had to do was Uber there and back. You\u2019re not helpless.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you and agreed to do something he couldn\u2019t, but surely you\u2019re a self sufficient person who can stand that he misses one appointment of many?\n\nEDIT: You\u2019ve just let everyone know that the night before he worked *16 hours*. You shouldn\u2019t have even asked him if that is true. Changing to YTA, please temper your expectations.", "NTA, he is, when you have a baby  you are on call 24/7", "Him blowing up at you like that is a big concern for me. He needs to start looking for a new job or he's going to end up behaving like that with your kids. Exhaustion is not an excuse for verbal abuse.", "Overall NAH..\n\nDid you see her comment where she said he worked 16 hours the previous day???\n\nThat man is extremely exhausted and burnt-out. His working hours is toxic and you need to sympathise with him.\n\nHe made the agreement last night because he thought he'll be able to handle it but he was burnt-out and barely recharge this morning", "NTA I\u2019m leaning toward N A H since it sounds like your bf is exhausted from working long hours to support you and the baby. He is in the wrong for not taking you to the appointment as promised, but I feel sympathy for him because of his grueling work schedule, if he was tired from drinking all night with his friend or okaying video games, I\u2019d say he was an AH but I\u2019m giving him a pass since this isn\u2019t habitual behavior and he was doing something that benefits you both by earning money to support his family.", "NAH, you're both kids, he's working long hours and having trouble coping.  You need to get together and talk about it.  Maybe he needs a different job, or you two need to set concrete expectations for how you'll handle it when he's overworked in the future?", "\"He said sure he would take me and we also have other things to do.\"\n\nHe said he would and he not only didn't, but seemed to be a bit of an asswipe about it. If he didn't want to/couldn't take you due to him being on call then he should have said so. It's not that hard. You seemed understanding when this came up before, why does he feel the need to act so defensive now?\n\nYou are NTA. This is only the tip of the Inconvenience Iceberg when it comes to having children. He needs to get used to it. You however also need to get used to driving. I know it sucks, I know it can be scary but you can't always rely on an Uber or a taxi...and it appears you may not always be able to rely on him if he doesn't get it together.", "Suggest you start making alternate plans on living the single life while married.

If you want to raise healthy children it\u2019s best if you can be healthy too.", "FWIW OP, I got my license really late too, like age uhhhh 26 or so. I was terrified because it went bad the first time when i was 18, but that was because I learned from my parents lol. Get some good lessons and you'll do great!", "I feel like since that\u2019s a temporary change based on conditions outside of his control, and he\u2019s the sole breadwinner for the family, changes in his work life just came at a bad time\u2026but adjustment needs to be made by *both* of you, and your adjustment needs to be in expectations.\n\nConstruction is very dangerous work, that I\u2019d rather my husband not do that work tired\u2026\n\nYes you\u2019re doing a majority of the work carrying the baby which is a grueling task, but he\u2019s under pressure too.", "Wait til he finds out how tired a kid makes you. Part of that convo needs to be how when the kid comes it\u2019s going to be earlier than 9 AM and yes he will be \u201con call\u201d 24/7/365. It\u2019s called being a parent.", "He\u2019s the breadwinner but I was working the whole pregnancy until recently when I went on maternity leave", "You know what else is exhausting? Parenting. If this is how he acts when he's exhausted and he's just, like, allowed to act like that like it's normal, maybe OP should take a step back to think about the structure of her relationship. Also, this sounds like an important appointment. The ones at the end of a pregnancy are often when you make decisions about delivery and find out important information about how things should go over the next couple weeks.", "If someone *makes a commitment to do something*, goes back on it for no reason, and then is rude and swears when questioned - I would say that\u2019s clear grounds to be annoyed with them. \n\nI\u2019d say in this scenario the partner is acting like a fragile, hormonal little doll - does he think parenting will be as optional as commitments to his partner when he\u2019s a little sleepy and grumpy and doesn\u2019t really feel like sticking to his word?\n\n\u2018Hormones\u2019 have nothing to do with anything here. Yes they exist, but OP specifically mentioned that instead of swearing and making rude comments like her partner did, she just just quietly walked away and did what she needed to do. Explain to me what exactly the over-reaction of a hormone ridden pregnant woman was here\u2026? Coz it sounds like her partner was the one having it.", "You are blaming her for his poor and irresponsible behaviour. He said he would take her  to the appt  then blew her off because he's tired? He doesn't sound like very good dad material. Your response is very patronizing and misogynistic.", "So was it his hormones making him act like an asshole then?", "I'm also autistic. I'd argue that our emotional needs and wants shouldn't be used as a yardstick for the general population. Some people are fine doing things on their own or would rather it that way. OP made her wishes clear to a partner who agreed to accompany her and then pulled out at the last minute.", "Thank you very much", "It\u2019s not a norm for him to work that long, that\u2019s the longest he\u2019s ever worked and it was due to the fact we had a big storm here so he\u2019s needed to help deal with that. His normal days are 12 hours or less", "Definitely, when I was waking him up we\u2019d already been asleep for 8 hours. I always love sleeping more then that but I that\u2019s a reasonable amount and probably way more then we\u2019re going to have in a couple months\ud83d\ude02", "I know this is annoying but it\u2019s too personal for me to share on the internet. It\u2019s not relationship threatening or anything like that. It\u2019s something he knows gets to me and missed the appointment because of it", "Thank you, I\u2019m trying to see clear through the hormones and at this stage it\u2019s super hard to do. I\u2019ll definitely catch him up later and explain why I was upset this morning.", "It\u2019s *one* slip up. You don\u2019t know their relationship and you\u2019re calling him blanket unsupportive and questioning his fitness as a parent. Be ashamed of yourself.", "We stay with his family and they\u2019re very helpful in that sense or Uber as I did today. But I do want to get my licence, just didn\u2019t have it before I got pregnant and with everything else going on and to plan for it\u2019s been put to the side but I know I gotta do it!", "Thank you for the reassurance\u2764\ufe0f", "That's a lot of pressure on a person. Now if something happens with his employment his child and you will suffer. For the first time in his life he's responsible for a family. \n\nWhat he said was shitty but you're acting like your life is the only one changing right now.", "As the parent of a child I gave birth to some 16 years back I am well aware than parenting is exhausting. But I\u2019m also in a 24 year long relationship and therefore don\u2019t judge my husband for an occasional outburst when he\u2019s exhausted, any more than he judges me. So long as OP\u2019s partner does the decent thing and apologises for his behaviour this evening, it\u2019s a blip and they should move on. \n\nIt would be even more exhausting for a relationship and its worth to only ever be evaluated on the last interaction. There is no point in a relationship if you don\u2019t have trust in and knowledge of each other\u2019s characters over the longer term to get you through the momentary crap that happens to everyone.", "If someone who is historically reliable and supportive makes a commitment to do something and then has one slip, I\u2019m more inclined to look at the bigger picture rather than the blip. \n\nRelationships are made over a long period. They\u2019ve been together 7 years. This is one incident and not a pattern so yes, to \u201cfeel like she\u2019s doing everything alone\u201d because of it when the rest of the pregnancy he\u2019s been supportive is an overreaction I\u2019d feel it was kinder to attribute to the hormones. \n\nUnless we\u2019re going to be drip fed a massive back story, we can\u2019t take this as any indication of his parenting ability.", "\"For no reason.\"\n\nWork your ass off over overly long shifts to make up for your partner being on leave, so you can still libe properly on 1 salary. Then we'll see of you have the balls to say BF missed it for \"no reason\".\n\nSure he shouldn't have snapped at her. But saying he missed the appointment for \"no reason\" is a lack of IQ at best, or a malicious attempt at breaking up 2 complete strangers at worst.", "Stress produces hormones. So does fatigue so yes. Or is only 1 gender allowed to blame things on hormones?  A man's body and mind changes during pregnancy too.", "Yep. I would say cut him some slack then for this one incident, and let him know that you aren't going to hold that absence against him. \n\n16 hours is soul destroying.", "You might want to encourage him to take a bit of a stand at work though, get him to tell his boss that there are certain hours of certain days he can't be on call. And that during the due week he can't be on call. He needs to be on call for you if you go into labour.", "Something like \"I always play basketball on Thursday and the appointment was on Thursday?\"", "I do understand but where I live we\u2019re entitled to a long maternity leave and get paid a percentage of our income to help with financial responsibilities. You are right though his life will be changing too", "No. Nothing like a previous agreement or hobby", "Not will be changing- has changed."]}
