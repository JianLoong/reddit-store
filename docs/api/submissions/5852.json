You need to realize he's coping and learning to adjust as well. You said you didn't drive so I assume you lean on him A LOT.  Between my 2 kids I think I went to like 5 appointments total. Only when my wife specifically asked me to come. But most of them I had work. \n\nDo you work or plan to stop working. \nEither is fine but you'll need to realize that if you're going to be a stay at home mom he has alot more stress on him making sure there's enough to go around. He has to know he has enough money, insurance, time. I was lucky my wife realized I was burning the candle at both ends and was burning out trying to be full time worker to maintain a household, full time dad, and full time husband.  Maybe some guys can do it but I couldn't. I needed a break somewhere. But couldn't communicate that. She noticed and helped me. \n\nShe got up on with the kids at night unless I was already up.  \nYou guys are a team now and need to look out for each other. You know he's working crazy hours and needed some sleep. Not wanted. Needed.  What if he fell asleep driving to the appointment?  \n\nYea it's shitty he said he would take you and then backed out.

He isn't perfect and said something thoughtless while half asleep. \n\nyou don't sounds very self sufficient at all which I find worrisome", "NTA. There was no need for him to be rude to you, especially after he agreed to take you. He could have said \"maybe.\" He could have said \"no.\" Also, this seems like an appointment he would want to attend. You found out you were pregnant 8 months ago? This baby is about to arrive any minute. \n\nThis kind of behavior is something to take seriously. There's a lot of sleep deprivation in his future, unless he decides to avoid some parental responsibility. I'd pay attention to how he feels entitled to act when he's tired.\n\nEdit: I see the obligatory \"I know he will be a good dad\" bit. Look, I'm rooting for this new family, but we can't ignore the fact that part of being a good dad is supporting and respecting the other parent. Even if the couple splits, part of being a good parent is not fucking things up, insulting the other parent, or resting and replenishing energy at the expense of the other.", "This isn't about the appointment.\n\nThis is about doing what you say you're going to do and keeping promises.\n\n>I know he\u2019s going to be a good dad to our son\n\nYou sure about that?\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wtf do you mean \"we\". \nBoth of you are 8 months pregnant?", "Soft YTA: it\u2019s the hormones doing this. If he\u2019s only missed 2 appointments in 8 months of pregnancy, that\u2019s pretty good. You\u2019re pregnant, not incapable, and you successfully made it to your appointment.", "NAH, looks like you both need to grow up. Saying you are doing everything alone because of 2 missed appointments and not being able to forgive him ever for that isnt a great way to move forward. Expecting him to miss work because you never learned to drive is ridiculous. He needs to grow up and realize that even after a long day at work, and I understand, my job has call too, hes going to have to wake up and be a parent, no excuses. Ive been called in at midnight after my normal 12 hr shift, worked until 4am and still wake up to take care of the kids at 7a. Its tough, but you both are going to need to buck up", "Ill be the odd man out. Yes you are. You are I am assuming stay at home. That means he is the sole bread winner and he s supporting you. You said he worked long hours. He is busting his ass working and trying. Last night I garuntee he knew he was taking you but after being up so long one you sleep its hard to wake up after that.\n\nHe has missed 2 appointments. 2 while being the only bread winner. \n\nI think it might be he who needs to reevaluate this. You seem extremely needy and irrational. Have you given any consideration to him. Neither of you knew what you were getting into at the beginning. You have both been learning as you go and he has been doing his best. Even you said he had a very long day and are now upset that he crashed and just couldnt get up.\n\nI am assuming you plan to be a stay at home mom which means while he will help considerably. There are going to be times you need to do me so he can function at work and not get fired.", "Babies wake up much earlier than 9am", "NTA but .... this is comparatively easy and he's complaining about being 'on call'?!", "NTA And it\u2019s not your hormones, it\u2019s hard when someone says you can count on them and then you can\u2019t.  You say you feel like you\u2019re doing it all alone, so is this the first time he has refused to come?  And it\u2019s never okay to talk to another person in a way that makes them feel like a burden. I hope he communicates better normally, and this is an outlier.\n\nTrust is the foundation of every relationship and his behavior cost you some trust.  I hope you can rebuild that because you\u2019re going to need it for coparenting.  \n\nFor me pregnancy was way easier than having a newborn when you\u2019re tired and struggling with a steep learning curve and a ton of physical changes. Maybe this is a good time to have a calm conversation about that.  That said, I do feel like my husband and I had a lot of conversations that then went out the window when our kiddo was born.  The default ends up that one parent (in our case me) does most of the caregiving and I think a lot of old patriarchal conditioning comes back and makes a lot of men feel like they don\u2019t have to do as much as their partners.", "NTA for being upset he lashed out at you. That\u2019s unacceptable\n\n\nHave you talked to him about you feeling like you\u2019re doing everything for the baby? From the looks of your comments, he\u2019s go with the flow and you like to plan, so a lot of that resentment might just be due to personality differences. It also sounds like he works an awful lot which might be his way of getting ready for the baby\u2026", "Yikes. Dude needs to take a chill pill and communicate. He should have said the night before that he's been super exhausted and said \" I'm not sure if I'll be able to tomorrow. If I feel upto it I will but otherwise do you think you can take an Uber.\"\n\nHow many hours a week is he working? Are you guys financially stressed? Is there any chance of drug use? Or medications he's on?", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of his work schedule, he made a promise.  Not only when you decided to keep the baby, but just the night before the appointment.\n\nAs the mother you don't have the luxury of deciding to \"skip out\" on being a prospective parent whenever you're tired.\n\nHaving to work is an acceptable excuse.  Wanting to sleep in is not.", " NTA. \nWhile it\u2019s understandable that he was exhausted and didn\u2019t want to wake up early the next morning, he had still agreed to take you the night prior. If he didn\u2019t want to wake up early and be responsible for the task he AGREED to do, he should\u2019ve let you know when you first asked.", "ESH: Reading your comments, it sounds like this is only the second thing he's missed across 8 months. Additionally, you mention that you're alone because he doesn't \"seem stressed,\" but now he finally shows a stress crack you don't like it.\n\nYes, he should've driven you but his reaction is also fair. Just like he doesn't know the stresses you're facing you don't know what he's feeling.", "NTA\n\n\nBeing a parent and partner is a 24/7 thing. You CANT skip the appointment, so why should here? The vast burden of having a family falls on the pregnant partner. Literally the least he can do is get up and get you there.", "NAH but I don\u2019t see any problems with you getting yourself to your appointments. It\u2019s time to grow up and not expect someone to coddle you and hold your hand. If you were in medical distress it would be a different but for routine appointments you should be able to go on your own. He probably shouldn\u2019t have promised to take you when he\u2019s so overworked and you have a right to feel let down.

He let you down and was a jerk about it too.", "NTA but then again neither is he.  He is exhausted from work.  Its not that he blew you off after gaming all night. If he has been there for you every step of the way minus a few appointments due to work then relax.  Hopefully you can catch him up later today and maybe even enjoy a lunch.", "NTA. You talked about it the night before and he agreed to take you.", "Yta grow up put your big girl pants on and go to your appointment that isn't hard my husband works and went to zero of my appointments with our first. And now with our second he only is takimg off because its high risk and he needs to be their during certain consults but just a regular heartbeat blood pressure check zero reason for him to go", "NTA. He agreed to take you and then he flipped this morning. You should have a heart to heart about managing expectations most especially around the final trimester and caring for your newborn. Life happens and it happens whether or not you are on call.", "NTA.\n\nHe agreed to it and he\u2018s just as responsible for all this as are you. We need to stop giving fathers a free pass whilst everything is on the woman regardless. You can\u2018t opt out, and he needs to learn that it\u2018s a 24/7 for him as well!", "ESH - you for the not driving thing. Babies require a lot of appointments so you need to prepare for the fact that you are putting everyone in a horrible position by not being mobile enough to care for yourself and the baby. \n\nShould he have snapped at you? Absolutely not. But driving tired/exhausted can be very dangerous. \n\nWhat happens when he gets called out and you/baby have an appointment?", "Is he going to be a great father, when he cannot take you to an appointment that he voluntarily agreed to participate with you? Just because he works doesn\u2019t give him the right to break a promise. It is that simple. You asked, he said yes, then he slept, leaving you to make last minute arrangements. Are you going to Uber to your delivery?", "NTA since you asked him ahead of time and he agreed to do it. He should have taken you to the appointment. But man the two of you have a lot of growing up to do if you're going to be parents. Both of you. He needs to follow through on his commitments. But you do, too. Are you planning to have a child and never drive? What are you going to do if your boyfriend is working and you need to go somewhere? Do you live in an area with robust public transportation where driving isn't required (like NYC or another big city)? I hope so, if you're planning never to get a driver's license. So, yes, your BF was TA. But both of you need a major reality check.", " E S H. I\u2019m assuming \u201con call\u201d means he\u2019s a doctor or something? Working long and late hours\u2026\n\nHe should not have agreed to do something he couldn\u2019t do, but I think a little empathy is required.\n\nHe\u2019s only missed 2 appointments in 8 months, once out of his control\u2026clearly he\u2019s exhausted and all you had to do was Uber there and back. You\u2019re not helpless.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you and agreed to do something he couldn\u2019t, but surely you\u2019re a self sufficient person who can stand that he misses one appointment of many?\n\nEDIT: You\u2019ve just let everyone know that the night before he worked *16 hours*. You shouldn\u2019t have even asked him if that is true. Changing to YTA, please temper your expectations. Your lack of empathy at hearing that number is kind of baffling.", "NTA, he is, when you have a baby  you are on call 24/7", "Him blowing up at you like that is a big concern for me. He needs to start looking for a new job or he's going to end up behaving like that with your kids. Exhaustion is not an excuse for verbal abuse.", "Overall NAH..\n\nDid you see her comment where she said he worked 16 hours the previous day???\n\nThat man is extremely exhausted and burnt-out. His working hours is toxic and you need to sympathise with him.\n\nHe made the agreement last night because he thought he'll be able to handle it but he was burnt-out and barely recharge this morning", "NTA I\u2019m leaning toward N A H since it sounds like your bf is exhausted from working long hours to support you and the baby. He is in the wrong for not taking you to the appointment as promised, but I feel sympathy for him because of his grueling work schedule, if he was tired from drinking all night with his friend or playing video games, I\u2019d say he was an AH but I\u2019m giving him a pass since this isn\u2019t habitual behavior and he was doing something that benefits you both by earning money to support his family.\n\nEdit: typo", "NAH, you're both kids, he's working long hours and having trouble coping.

Maybe he needs a different job, or you two need to set concrete expectations for how you'll handle it when he's overworked in the future?", "\"He said sure he would take me and we also have other things to do.\"\n\nHe said he would and he not only didn't, but seemed to be a bit of an asswipe about it. If he didn't want to/couldn't take you due to him being on call then he should have said so. It's not that hard. You seemed understanding when this came up before, why does he feel the need to act so defensive now?\n\nYou are NTA. This is only the tip of the Inconvenience Iceberg when it comes to having children. He needs to get used to it. You however also need to get used to driving.

You guys shouldn\u2019t be having a baby yet", "Nah\nGetting a bit annoyed because you needed an Uber is understandable but also being absolutely crushed after a 16hour shift. Driving while being dead tired is also dangerous. Him getting kinda aggressive was not the best thing but he also has to deal with a lot of stuff which can fuck up your plans to some degree. Maybe you both can say sorry and maybe work around that he takes you to your appointments when he not had just finished such a long shift", "YTA. As a person who works 100+ hours a week, I can relate. How many hours are you working each week? Being on call 2 days sounds like he\u2019s been up 48+ hours. \n\nThat said, get a drivers license. Learn to drive. You don\u2019t need him there every step of the way. Please grow up before having children.", "Yes, I\u2019m sorry but YTA, although I\u2019d like to be kind and gentle about this. I also think his response was not fair even though he was frustrated, he could work on talking about it with you instead of reacting. It sounds like you both need to talk/communicate and plan for how you are able to support one another, as you both have needs that are important to attend.\n\nIt\u2019s really not realistic or reasonable for you to let your fear of driving put your responsibilities onto others. Having a baby will only make this situation worse for you and your boyfriend. Once the baby is here, you will have more appointments and more needs. This leaves him with having to do all the errands with you or without you because you don\u2019t drive. \n\nI understand as a first time parent that you want him at every appointment. It\u2019s a special time. However, some of those appointments they will only be measuring your belly, sticking a heart beat monitor on your baby for a few seconds and that\u2019s it. I\u2019d invite him to the big appointments like ultrasounds, and give him some slack on the more minor/mundane ones. As for doing everything on your own, I guess we don\u2019t really have all the info to know if he\u2019s really helping you or totally blowing you off all the time. He sounds really busy. Are there other things he\u2019s trying to do to support you? Does he make attempts to attend to you emotionally and with other helpful tasks when he isn\u2019t on call or isn\u2019t busy with work? Does he help you in preparing the home for the baby? It\u2019s not an excuse, but it is often difficult for some men to connect with the baby and also fully grasp that impending needs to a baby because they are not connected like the mother is. Once baby comes, they are more likely to really get it and begin their journey of connection, hopefully. I\u2019d start talking with him not about your needs and the needs of your baby, and how you can plan to share certain and specific responsibilities so you know you have support. Read articles together, talk about who will do what- night feeds, getting bottles, cleaning bottles and pump parts, dishes, cooking.. for example, if you\u2019re doing all night feeds because he is working he could at least get up and bring baby to you or get you what you need to nurse then go back to sleep. He would wash all the bottle and pump parts, he could take our the diaper pail, bring snacks. He may not be able to nurse the baby, but those little things will help you a lot. \n\nIf you\u2019re afraid of driving, I highly recommend going to therapy to work ok this fear. Specially, someone who specializes in anxiety and phobias. Someone who practices CBT, ACT, and exposure based approaches is likely going to be able to help you best. Other forms of therapy, like basic talk therapy, may make it worse or just waste your money/time.", "I'd say ESH...your boyfriend shouldn't have promised to drive you this morning knowing he's been super tired and exhausted from work. And how he responded to you was in bad taste. But you also should expect since he's the one who is driving and making the money I'm assuming that sometimes he won't be able to make the appointments. You both need to communicate better with each other. And figure out a system that will help you both out especially with the baby on the way. I'm sure he's aware that parenting is a 24/7 job but we also have to take in consideration the parent that works as well as parents can get burnt-out which isn't fun for anyone. So you two need to sit down, and figure something out so you don't get burnout and he doesn't get burnout before this baby comes.\n\nGood luck with your family. And I hope it all works out for you.", "NAH. Hey I get it, I\u2019m currently 31 weeks pregnant and have been having lots of health problems with it. I get how stressed you are, and how overwhelming pregnancy is at this point. My husband and I are 30 and we\u2019re STILL stressing about having our first baby.  While it\u2019s completely normal to feel hurt after someone snaps at you, and when you\u2019re disappointed, I think this may just be your hormones making you overly sensitive. \n\nYou\u2019ve already said you know BF will be a great dad. You\u2019ve been together for all of your adult lives and then some. In 8 months this is only the second time he hasn\u2019t made it to an appointment. Y\u2019all are both young, and while you are stressed getting the home ready for your baby, BF is stressed trying to get financially and mentally ready for your baby. In time you will learn that you each experience and display stress in different ways, for different reasons. Considering his added work stress from being on call and exhaustion after working a 16 hour shift, this is a moment you may need to extend him some grace. When you get home after he has rested, have an open vulnerable conversation about what you\u2019re each stressed about, and how you can be there for each other. Communication and grace are going to have to be incredibly intentional (and abundant) over the next year, but especially for the next 6 months.", "ESH\n\nHe shouldn't have snapped but you should also have some understanding for him. He worked a really long shift and is the sole breadwinner. You're pregnant but you're not incapable of attending an appointment alone due to a change in circumstances (his being called out to work a hard and physically demanding shift). \n\nA relationship is a partnership.", "Possibly against the grain, but ESH. He shouldn\u2019t have snapped like that. But seriously, he was on call all week, and just recently got off a massive shift. With his lack of sleep, I am not surprised he didn\u2019t really have much tact. He has barely missed any, and you had other ways to get there. When you knew he was getting off late, you could have switched up the plans and found a different way there, and let him sleep. Parenting is hard, but he is not a single parent, he is a co-parent. \n\nPart of coparenting is that you take up the slack when your partner is wiped out or sick, and they return the favor of you are struggling. Maybe next time, try to understand from his side, and not the \u2018parents are not human beings with needs\u2019 mind set. Go to your appointment, share the pictures when you get home, and tell him that he owes you a few of your craving treats for snapping. And maybe a foot massage. Then plan better if the next appointment is after a 16 hour shift, on your end.", "YTA. Get a fucking drivers license. You\u2019re about to have a child. You can\u2019t not drive for the rest of your life and expect him to chauffeur you two everywhere.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s not reasonable for him to make every single appt when he\u2019s working so much. You\u2019ll need to be able to independently get to a doctor\u2019s office anyway if you\u2019re ever going to be alone with the baby. \n\nI think it makes sense for him to prioritize working all the hours he can *before* the baby is born so he can dial it back once the baby\u2019s here. He has his priorities right. I\u2019m sure he wanted to be there today, but sometimes being a team means taking care of yourself so the other can do the same.", "ESH I think if he agreed to go then he should at least acknowledge that. I also think it\u2019s reasonable that he\u2019s tired from work. I don\u2019t think either of you are TA but I think you should have a conversation about this", "It sounds like he\u2019s working to provide for your little family. I think you have to be understanding that he\u2019s going to be tired after working long hours. Not everyone likes having to work long shifts and then have to wake up early to drive someone somewhere. Albeit, you aren\u2019t just anyone. \nNAH I think he needs to realize a baby will make you way more tired than an early appointment, but you should also aim to be understanding because he works long shifts (according to you).", "NAH. No relationship is perfect and there's going to be a lot of learning to do with a child coming along the way. Sometimes we have to remember that people aren't perfect and promises/agreements can be broken because of unforeseen circumstances. \n\nYour boyfriend shouldn't have yelled at you but I imagine that he agreed to take you to the appointment during a time when he still had energy. It did sound like he really did want to take you and be there for you, but he probably felt super exhausted when the actual time came. 16 hours in a physically demanding job? I think it's okay to have a little empathy here for him... And for the people saying \"well this is what happens when you have kids\". Yes, but let him learn... He's literally going to be a new father and will probably mature along the way.\n\nI recommend to discuss with your boyfriend about having more realistic expectations and to not yell at you again during stressful situations. Next time he has a long shift and has to take you somewhere early in the morning? He needs to be more realistic about it so you're not scrambling with trying to find a ride at the last second.", "NTA\n\nIs this normal behavior for him when he gets woken up?

I understand you're pregnant and things just get on the nerve these days. But you need to understand that he worked 16 hours previous day and even if he had slept 8 hours, sometimes it's difficult to wake up. \n\nHow is he on usual basis? Does he shouts on you regularly? You are together since a long time so you know how he is usually. Did he miss any other appointments excluding the one on Friday and today? Why do you feel like you are doing EVERYTHING alone? \n\nPeople do crazy things when stressed. Right now, he is stressed and so are you. Once the baby is here, it will get more stressful. And even more once you go back to work. So you two have to support each other.

But you two just seemed to have skipped over that and thought \"we decided to keep, so we will figure it out!\" Without fully grasping the many unknowns. You need to learn to drive/start driving. And he needs to realize that parenthood is on call for 18 years. Both of you need to stop romanticizing parenthood, just because you've been together that long does not mean you're ready for a baby, clearly both of you need to grow some more responsibility.", "NTA but now is the time to discuss expectations around parenting duties and who\u2019s responsible for what.

It's actually probably  good that you were driven by an awake driver instead of a tired guy dragged out of bed after an extra-long work day...\n\nThese things will happen.   When you got back and he was awake,  did he even remember?  Did he apologize?   Not every bump in your road together is a sign that something is wrong,  or that he doesn't love the two of you.   Just roll with it,  unless, OVER TIME, he proves to be inconsiderate and deceitful.  You're going to disagree on a LOT of things over the years,  and you need to pick your battles carefully.

If he has only missed one other appointment and has been there for everything else. You need to learn some coping skills. The storms will happen again and he will be called out again. It is the reality of the job. He is likely just as stressed about life as you, but in different ways, especially if he is the sole income.", "ESH.\n\nHe agreed to take you and then lashed out at you when you tried to hold him to that. That sucks.\n\nBut making every single appt is a big ask, imo. I'm on my second baby with a different partner for both kiddos. My ex husband made like 3 of a bazillion. My current partner has made 2 of a bazillion. My ( now weekly) appt for 38 weeks took 15 minutes with blood pressure check and heart beat check for baby and belly size check. Making my partner disrupt his work day for that? I feel like is unrealistic. It definitely sucks to miss a sono cause those are at least \"fun\" but it sounds like it was out of his hands.\n\nPeople on here talking about how he has to get used to no sleep--y'all need to get used to taking turns in responsibility with baby and house. You can't be two people doing the same thing with one baby. You shouldn't be shadowing each other and expanding your sleep deprivation and caregiver burnout. Being able to sleep and rest are critical for both of your mental well being and health.\n\nLearn to give each other breaks post partum. Have empathy for each other's struggles and needs. \n\nYour anxious, you're tired, maybe you are struggling--and at my current 38 weeks I feel you--that lash out and his over commitment sucks but it sounds like he's balancing alot. Assuming he supports you in many ways, look for a way to support his struggles reciprocally and prioritize your asks based on what you need the most and what you can spare to relax.", "IMO, it sounds like he was exhausted from working.  Yes, he definitely should have communicated it better; however, I wouldn\u2019t take it personally.  Based upon his past involvement, it sounds like his exhaustion was talking.  I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t be upset or disappointed by his behavior. It\u2019s just perspective.\n\nAs others stated, you need to get your license.  One, you won\u2019t have to rely on others and that stress will be eliminated.  Two, it will be freeing for you to come and go as you please when necessary.  You also need to discuss that when the baby is born exhaustion will be the norm.  \n\nAlso, to give you perspective on my experience, my husband couldn\u2019t get off work and only came to 2-3 ultrasounds during our high risk pregnancy(wasn\u2019t sure if my daughter would survive at birth). I was going monthly, then weekly the last 2 months.  So I wouldn\u2019t be too hard on your BF.", "NTA. If you at the appointment right now, this just happened. However, if you're going to do this together, he needs to work on his communication skills and probably emotional regulation or he's going to be a frustrating co-parent. We all lose our tempers or throw tantrums sometimes, and I could even understand his exhaustion and feeling deserving of a break. I am guessing he was helping do repairs after the major snow storm and it may have been harrowing or felt like a very \"special\" event and he wants a special recovery. No one can decide for you how meaningful missing the appointment is. Is it a huge breach? A \"meh\" in the greater scheme of things? You might have the flexibility to give him the \"time off\" if you have a healthy relationship, generally. \n\nHowever, without a doubt, how he behaved was immature and damaging. If he's at the end of his bandwidth because he's exhausted he needs to say that in a loving way, and also expect he might not get what he wants. And, when you're exhausted, he needs to offer the same care and flexibility he would want. If I were him, and I was really exhausted in an unusual way I would have said something like \"Hon, I am so exhausted from work yesterday, I know it will likely hurt your feelings because I promised, but can I please stay and sleep in today? I'm sorry, I was excited for today but I am really not feeling good. I commit to making the next appointment.\" And then I would get up to make you a tea to take and see you out the door. And I would also know that I would likely have to do a number of other reparative actions and show a lot of attentiveness to make up for it.\n\nWhen you get home - see what he does and says. Maybe he feels terrible about his tantrum. If he ignores the issue, you probably need to talk because there's going to be a lot more days like this ahead of you and you need to have a strategy. Children rely on a stable bond between their parents - you and your husband need to be on the same team and work out differences like adults or you could force your kid to be a little adult before they are ready to fill in the gaps, and that can be a real problem for children.\n\nThis ended up being a lot longer than I meant.\n\nBeing young is hard - also, very few people get taught good emotional regulation and communication skills that help relationships and healthy attachment. These things are also really important for parenting, so if you have not done much research on things I urge you and your partner to put some time in.", "Nta - but I think more communication is needed.

The absolute worst time I\u2019ve ever had in any normal (not abusive) relationship was the 6-8 weeks right after I had our son. When no one is sleeping, the fights get really really really nasty. It is mission critical that all adults get between 4-6 hours of uninterrupted sleep every day. Eventually you\u2019ll be able to go back to normal but shift sleeping with a minimum number of hours per person per day kept us sane and saved our relationship.", "NAH\n\nOP, you are going to have to learn how to get yourself around without depending on your BF as your only source of transportation.

IMO this is less about him doing what he said he was gonna do and more about the communication.

If he had decided to respond and even said, \"Babe I'm sorry, I worked for 16 hours yesterday and I don't think I can do this this morning.

Honestly, if he's that tired, it's probably not safe for him to drive \u2014 being there for every single appointment is valiant but hard in practice.\n\nEveryone should be allowed to listen to their body and change plans when necessary. If he woke up sick, it's the same deal. But he doesn't get to ignore you, be uncooperative, and then snap at you when he agreed to this beforehand and hasn't communicated with you at all about it \u2014 you're left waiting and wondering in a stressful situation when you two are supposed to work together as a team.

I had such things happen to me fairly often after those shifts and going 24h without any sleep is much different. We're talking constant slow grinding down of the human body for quite some time now and that's dangerous to not recuperate properly afterwards, and that means a ton of sleeping.

I\u2019ll ask when he wakes up if he remembers saying that", "Yes, I\u2019m studying to get my licence", "Definitely. I am upset over it but nothing that\u2019s going to cause a major fight. He will get a pass for this one but I also want to let him know he could respond better next time. I got home just now and he\u2019s still asleep (I\u2019ll leave him be until he wakes up then we can talk it out)\n\nEdit: typo", "No I am not", "He\u2019s missed a few, mostly due to work though", "Yes he\u2019s overjoyed to be a dad, we talked about that early on in the relationship and all he\u2019s ever wanted is a family", "I disagree. This isn't just her medical condition that she needs to man up for. Her and her partner made this baby together and so it's a unique situation where medical appointments are relevant for both of them.\n\nI do think OP is not being very understanding and shouldn't jump to feeling so alone. But her partner should find a way to be there, or if not, calmly let OP down in a kind way. There was no mention of a 'I'm sorry, things changed and I physically cannot go anymore'. It was left to the last min when OP was already stressed about so much. That isn't cool.", "Not to mention OP is going to need to figure out how to get herself and baby to the multitude of appointments after they\u2019re born. Your partner can\u2019t be expected to go to all of those as well, especially when you\u2019ve mentioned you have a long maternity leave paid at a percentage of your income. I\u2019m also currently 8 month pregnant and see absolutely no reason my husband needs to come to my appointments unless there\u2019s an ultrasound and he wants to be there for that. It also seems like you both need to communicate better about parenting styles and expectations. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with being more go with the flow (which actually has some evidence that women who do view birth that way have more positive birth experiences) and there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to plan, but you need to get on the same page about expectations", "Y.t.a for this response.\ud83e\udd28", "You don\u2019t need to learn how to drive to be a mother \ud83d\ude11", "I'd say he is an AH  because he blew up at her.  Not for nagging him but because he said he'd take her and then he didn't want to.  I get being exhausted but baby tired is worse than any tired.  I hope this was not a common way he treats her.", "And knowing that he\u2019s working 16 hour days (mentioned it was physical labor) should also mean not scheduling 9am appointments. Parenting is 24/7, but partnership is not always 50/50 all the way. Sometimes it\u2019s 30/70, 70/30, or 49/51. The key is working together. Not hard to request an afternoon appt so her BF can get some sleep.", "He worked 16 hours the night before, OP said.", "I am more worried that she is going to be the mom who is \u201cso busy\u201d and \u201cso tired\u201d by doing for her child.", "Can you run me through your logic here? Did I miss something major in the OP? Most women who are pregnant and live in first-world countries don't work right up until their baby is born, do they? And how did you get the bit about being a stay-at-home mom? Was there a comment I missed?", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions.", "He said he would take her the night before. He snapped at her when she tried to get him to follow up on his promise. She is NTA for being upset. If he had kindly asked if she would be okay going without him, and apologized for reneging on his promise, I doubt she would be upset.", "Agree on the judgement.\n\nYou can't learn to drive in less than a month. Round here, you can't book a test less than 3 months in advance. Also, in many places it's perfectly possible to depend on pre-booked minicabs and public transport with a baby as long as you know in advance (though not Ubers as those usually don't have car seats).", "Thank you very much", "That\u2019s how I feel as well. I understand now with other commenters saying they\u2019ve done the same shift and feel totally dead after sleeping for a while. Just don\u2019t appreciate the way he went about it but he was half sleepy. People have helped me realize that too. Posted on here to get some rational opinions because I know being hormonal doesn\u2019t always make me see things how they should be seen", "He said he would take her the night before. He snapped at her when she tried to get him to follow up on his promise. She is NTA for being upset. If he had kindly asked if she would be okay going without him, and apologized for reneging on his promise, I doubt she would be upset.", "This is absolutely ridiculous. Sorry, but once you\u2019re having a baby, you don\u2019t get to sleep in anymore. In fact, sleep is a lot more rare as soon as the baby arrives. Those are the consequences of getting your gf pregnant. You know who is also exhausted from carrying a baby around at all times but cannot miss the appointment?? OP. You think pregnant people sleep well all night? That they aren\u2019t carrying around extra weight on the front of their bodies at all times?! Being a parent is hard and not always fair. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to wake up even when you\u2019re exhausted to take your kid to an appointment to make sure they\u2019re healthy. Snapping at your pregnant partner as if she solely made the baby she\u2019s carrying is wildly uncalled for. OP\u2019s bf needs to put his big boy pants on and communicate like a proper adult. He said the night before he\u2019d be there.", "What?!?! This man is working call outs and misses an appointment and this is a Red Flag? Let the man sleep!", "He just worked a physically grueling 16 hour day at work. He\u2019s the sole breadwinner. He deserves some sleep, no?", "IT WENT THROUGH MY MIND THOUGH! But I stopped myself, I don\u2019t want to let my emotions do my acting for me so I stayed quiet and the coffee is still there lol", "In the OP it's said he's missed at least one other appointment that we know of. How tf are her hormones \"out of control?\"", "What do her hormones have to do with him being a jerk and failing to do what he said he would? \n\nShould she stop relying on him because of this? Probably. But she asked if she was a jerk for trying to hold him to his own promise.", "You say he\u2019s going to be a good dad, but the way he\u2019s acting makes me wonder. Because parenthood is all about being on call 24/7 and early morning wake ups.", "Only say that to him if you want a fight. Otherwise, have a conversation about this.", "You'll be right, but if you say it, especially that way, it will really piss him off.", "I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a mature way to communicate that will go over well.", "Hopefully, this is just a one time too early and tired to realize kind of deal. We all have our moments like that sometimes. You should talk to him when you get home and explain your feelings. You have every right to be upset about a broken promise. NTA", "I can't condone saying exactly that to him, but a reminder that parenting is 24/7/365 for 18 years wouldn't be remiss. It's a learning curve for both of you, and a long, frank conversation about expectations and needs will go a long way.\n\nGood luck.", "Is this the first issue that you've had with him in the 8 months you've been pregnant?", "Can't believe this is upvoted. If you say that you'll not only start an unnecessary fight but will be TA as well", "NTA. I\u2019ll be honest: sounds like you will be raising that kid by yourself / doing all the heavy lifting. I\u2019m sure he is a really nice guy: great dads show up no matter how tired. \n\nKeep your eyes open, and make decisions that are best for you and your babies. Good luck!", "NTA. As someone who has been taking call jobs since my teens, being able to take call made me a tad more able/practiced (compared to my spouse) to do the \u201cwake up, feed & change, go back to sleep\u201d without as much grumpiness. I felt like I was on call the first four months after my spouse had our kid. Tell him to get used to it.", "Learn to drive.", "He\u2019s missed two appointments? My husband only was able to attend 2-3 appointments total because of work. He only attended the major ultrasounds, but even then he had to miss one because of work. It happens.", "Honestly that sounds like its not a matter of you doing more, but rather just you two having a very different approach to things.", "You need to grow up. He can\u2019t come to every single appointment if he\u2019s working to support you guys. That\u2019s not a realistic expectation. You both have a lot of maturing to do.", "Did he know about today\u2019s appointment before last night?", "Your car seat situation is going to be super annoying to deal with if you don\u2019t drive. It means you have to keep a base in every car of someone who gives you a ride and wait for them every time, or you have to get a car seat that doesn\u2019t need a base and you have to re-install it every time you need to drive your baby somewhere. \n\nI don\u2019t know how often you need to drive since you live in some sort of city, but this could add up to a lot of hassle not to mention unsafe car seat installation. I would try and become an expert on how to install it yourself BEFORE you give birth because it is easy to get wrong.", "Honestly, if you live in a big city with public transportation, you don't need to force yourself to get a license. I reluctantly got mine 7 years ago and I still walk or take the bus everywhere, including with my kids. The only thing that changed once I got my license is our insurance is now more expensive.", "I am a mom of a daughter age 21. She suffers from anxiety and audio and visual learning difficulties. She doesn\u2019t drive. We tried teaching her but the amount of stimulus and quick decision making required for safe driving is simply not something she can handle. She actually passed her driver\u2019s test!  However she is simply not safe to drive. Her life and the safety of others takes priority. Don\u2019t punish yourself over this but maybe be willing to handle some appointments by Uber etc so that your limitations don\u2019t always fall on others.", "I totally get your anxiety around driving, I was the same at your age. But I am so so thankful I pushed past the anxiety and got my licence before I had kids. I honestly can't imagine how much harder it would be having to navigate getting around with kids if I hadn't got my licence. It's made life as a parent a million times easier being able to drive.", "For your own good, not even for the child, I really really advise you to take drivibg lessons when you can. It won't feel great to be dependent on people to get somewhere spontaneously in a few years anymore and it's likely you or the others or both will grow resentful if your mobility depends on them. Plus.. That too is part of becoming an adult. I know many many people who hate driving, but if they have to they can and will and it's really important.", "You\u2019ll do fine getting a license. As a person riddled with anxiety, it\u2019s scary at first, but it becomes second nature afterwards. And if you fail the first driver\u2019s test (not the written one), don\u2019t sweat it; majority of people fail their first driver\u2019s test when they get behind the wheel.", "I would really encourage you to try and deal with your anxiety around driving before baby arrives. Once baby is here there are so many other anxieties and new stressors associated with baby. Also it can be very isolating if you\u2019re stuck at home without a way to easily get around by yourself. Being able to drive yourself to baby\u2019s doctors appointments, mommy and me classes, or just lunch with a friend and baby can make a huge difference to your mental well being. Good luck with everything and congrats!", "I just wanted to say that you don\u2019t ever need to learn to drive if you don\u2019t want to. My mum started taking me on the subway at 3 days old. My dad drove but he was often busy at work and my mum showed me you can be independent and mobile no car involved. Was it harder? Sometimes yes and sometimes no. Depending on the city public transportation is often less stress and faster and you don\u2019t need to worry about parking. That being said I did choose to learn to drive myself when I was 21 and I\u2019m very glad I did as it is a useful skill. But what ever you end up choosing you and your child will be fine.", "I was in a bad accident at 22, and after years of being scared, I refused to get in a car unless a specific group of people were driving for over a year. I got better at it, but didn\u2019t get my license until I was 30, 2 months after the birth of my son. It can be done. I am still terrified, but he needs me to drive, so we make it work. My partner still does most of the driving, but I can do it if I have to lol.", "Having grown up in Brooklyn myself, my mom didn\u2019t get her license until she was 33, had three kids and we moved to the \u2018burbs and she didn\u2019t have a choice!

Deal with your anxiety. But this scenario and the lack of maturity you are describing tells me you both need to grow up a bit.

Can't think of any lasting damage from her doing her best while in the worst of health with limited resources. \n\n\nAlso, repeatedly demanding someone learn to drive when they have stated multiple times that they live in a large city with adequate public transportation is ridiculous.

I drove all the way until I gave birth, I was in literal labor and didn\u2019t know it (only had back labor) and drove to store to get something. While I agree he should have communicated, she should get a license. If she has severe anxiety over driving, maybe she should go to therapy and find the root cause of why there is anxiety. \nI\u2019m also a nurse and know that after 16 hour shifts we\u2019re not allowed to work because you\u2019re classified as \u201clegally drunk\u201d until we\u2019ve slept for at least 8 hours. Therefore, sleeping is extremely important to get the body back online. \n\nHonestly, a soft ESH due to hormones.\n\nOP go to therapy after baby to deal with your anxiety so you can become more independent. Also, tell your partner to communicate better as raising a baby is ALL communication.", "lol what? I had to get myself to work when I was pregnant and worked right up until I had each of my kids (quite literally - with the second kid I started feeling crampy at lunchtime, went home early, and ended up giving birth later that day). I wasn\u2019t having my husband drive me everywhere for the last months. The OP\u2019s situation is different because she doesn\u2019t drive anyway due to anxiety, but for people that do drive regularly, I\u2019ve never heard that they should stop driving a car toward the end of pregnancy.

No. Is it your fault that you are allowing your anxiety make you dependent on other resources? Yes. \n\nAre you employed or is he the sole income?", "NTA. You won't be able to forgive him for missing an appointment? The only example you've given of feeling like you're doing everything is that appointment and this one? He shouldn't have snapped at you so he sucks for that but unless he's done more than miss two appointments you are really overdramatizing this. Apparently there's more so I edited my judgement but you are making people hunt for it so I'll say you aren't the AH but honestly you should put relevant details where people can find it.", "Fair, but I think there's a pretty wide gulf between average first time parent and this kid.", "And that's valid. Talk to him. I hope he admits his fault, apologizes, and yall can move forward. Also, tell him to be honest about his situation instead over overextending himself so yall can plan better.

Honestly I say to take it at your own pace- if you ever feel the need or want to get a license, the combo of a kind, professional instructor and a sprinkling of therapy did WONDERS for my eventual driving journey.

You both made a baby so you both should share responsibility, whether one is exhausted or not. NTA", "To be fair, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a straight answer here. Everyone copes with and is accustomed to long work hours differently. I\u2019m a surgeon, so that means 16 hour work days is not unusual; 24 hour work days is also not unusual for me - and this can be spent on my feet operating for most of it, with few breaks for eating or using the bathroom. And not unusual for very long days to be back to back (to back to back\u2026 sometimes). 8 hours of sleep would be a god send. I would absolutely be expected to be back at work, running errands, etc after such a generous respite. However, I recognize that someone not used to working long hours or unusual hours may spend days recovering.

The seat / carrier itself is awkward and as the baby gets bigger heavy. I had a c section so caring the baby in it was at the max limit I was supposed to carry. Maybe even a few pounds over. It definitely didn't feel good those first couple of weeks. The base isn't that big but probably adds a couple of pounds and a decent amount of bulk. I wouldn't want to carry it into the doctor's office if I didn't have to. \n\nNext, installing the car seat always took me longer than a minute. Again, it's awkward and trying to get it thru the hocks and have stuff not get tangled or twisted was hard. Plus ours had these buckles that clipped in to the back. And then it's supposed to be leveled so I'd have to adjust the angle depending on the car. Plus our cars are small and always required us moving up the passenger seat. It's not that hard but longer than a minute. I'd guess 5 minutes once you get good at it. \n\nMeanwhile you have to do something with the baby while you are doing all that. Theoretically they could be put in the seat on the ground but it always seemed to be those times that my son screamed his head off. Plus if it's cold outside that gets less ideal. Not to mention snow. I wouldn't want to put the seat on the ground right now, we have salt and sludge everywhere.", "Definitely.
