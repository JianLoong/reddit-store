Before that, I lived in Missouri with my ex for a year but he ended up being an abusive cheating pos, so I left. He was financially abusive as well and wouldn't let me get a job, so as soon as I moved in with my grandparents, I started job searching. Got employed a month later.\n\nWell, moving in with them was a last minute decision because I called them the day I found out my ex had cheated. And because of that, they didn't have a lot of time to prepare the spare room for me, which had accumulated years and years of their stuff in it. I mean, they literally have random stuff shoved in every corner of my room, and my entire closet (literally the whole thing, even the shelves and floor) is taken up by clothes and shoes they don't t wear. I have an 8 drawer dresser for my clothes. They cleared out one drawer for me, the rest are taken up by their clothes and jewelry. \n\nAt first it wasn't an issue to me because I only had enough stuff to fill an old backpack (I didn't have my own money ofc and my bf never provided anything for me) and it all fit in the drawer. That stuff had long since stopped fitting me and I needed new clothes, so of course once I started working, i've been buying new clothes. As in underwear that fits, bras that fit, tops and bottoms, summer dresses, stuff for work, and shoes.\n\nBefore I even started working, I told them that id be needing space for my stuff to go. They said they would d start clearing my room out.\n\n....its been eight months, and all of my new stuff has been sitting in bags on the floor because they haven't taken a single thing out of my room. They're excuse is \"there is several years worth of stuff in there, its gonna take time.\" ITS BEEN EIGHT FREAKIN MONTHS?? Almost nine smh. And not a single thing had been cleared. \n\nToday I was running late for work because I couldn't find the new jeans I had bought for my uniform. Had to dig through several bags to find them, and all I could think was \"I shouldnt be having to do this, this is fkn ridiculous\" So when I got home from work today, I grabbed as much clothes from the closet as I could at once, and put them in their room on the bed. \n\nThey're mad at me now. My grandma said it was disrespectful to move her stuff and is now upset with me because she has to find space for all of those clothes. My grandpa said that I could've just asked instead of throwing their stuff out of my room and is on her side.\n\nAITA?? Should I have just let it be until they do it themselves??\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that they drive me to work and pick me up because I dont have a car yet, but I pay them gas money and $250 in rent even though I only make $400-$600 a month.\n\nEdit 2: i get they are elderly, but this woman literally makes appointment every Sunday to go get her hair and nails done.

It's not *your* room, it's your grandparent's *spare* room.  They took you in when you had no where else to go, but I'm imagine they didn't mean to take you in indefinitely.  It's been 8 almost 9 months, do you have a plan for getting your own place?", "YTA. They took you in last minute and have been helpful. You could show some grace. They are old people- why not ask them how they would like the stuff put away one weekend and help them do so? You could do so much better.", "YTA - there were so many better options.  I truly do understand why you're frustrated and I'm not going to lecture you on being grateful. Another drawer and some closet space is a reasonable ask.  And, for real, good for you for getting out of that bad situation and starting over, that's amazing. But oh my gosh, there were just so many better options. Offer to help them! Set a time! Ask how they'd like to start! Or just find a place to stack the clothes or work out a system with the bags, worst come to worst. Acting impulsively from frustration was immature and has hurt your relationship with them and was in no way worth it. \n\nYou owe them a massive and humble apology. And make them a nice dinner or something like that.", ">I only make $400-$600 a month\n\nThis makes me think you work only part time. Which gives YOU  time to organise your things better and finds small living space solutions. \n\nYTA and entitled AF", "YTA.\n\nYour $250 dollars likely covers their gas, maybe the rise in utilities and a small portion of your groceries. So it means basically nothing. You had no right to move anything. If they want you to remain in a room full of their things then you can deal with it or move out. Or live like that until they get around to cleaning it up. \n\nIt sounds like you work very very part time so you need to look for full time work so you can get your own place.", "YTA\n\nOh my gosh YTA. You are not owed tons of space from your grandparents.   \nIf you want empty dresser drawers, get your own apartment and your own dresser.   \n\n\nUntil then, you have a safe place to stay.  That\u2019s incredibly nice of them.   \nThey\u2019re not making space because they don\u2019t want you to stay indefinitely. You\u2019ve been there eight months. How about instead of complaining, you are grateful. And figure out a system for your jeans. A neat stack seems reasonable.", "YTA. they aren\u2019t obligated to do shit. They could easily say to you why are you still living with us it\u2019s been 8 months. You sound so ungrateful. They\u2019ve provided a home in the most expensive state to live in. You had no where to go. Get over yourself", "YTA.  While I understand it is annoying that they haven't made more room for you after 8 months, the way you handled it was rude and disrespectful.  They don't owe you anything. You are a guest in their home, invading their space, and paying far, far less than market value in rent.  You don't seem to appreciate the fantastic deal you have.  You seem like an entitled, spoiled brat.  You can't afford to live anywhere else on your small salary from your part time job, so you should appreciate that you have a house to live in and utilities and food.", "Yta who do you think you are these people open their home to you and you basically threw their shit out of their own room yeah you\u2019re living there right now but that\u2019s still their room. You owe nothing in that house other than your property get over yourself. You\u2019re lucky that they let you stay with them so last minute because they wanted to help you how disrespectful can you be? I would\u2019ve kicked you out if I was them I hope they do. Because from your post you only make $400-$600 a month and I bet you you\u2019re not paying for rent you say that you give them 250 that\u2019s for just your gas to get to work you don\u2019t pay rent and they give you rides to work so maybe you should get up and find your own place if you find it so hard to live there instead of actually waiting for them to clear it out. The entitlement on this one. The audacity is just mind blowing.", "YTA for ONE reason IMHO - you put the stuff on their bed. Surely there was another room or attic or hallways or corner of your room where you could have put the stuff? And do you have a parent (their child) that you could have called to explain the dilemma? You didn\u2019t think it through.", "YTA. I agree with the old man; you should have at least asked. I get it that it\u2019s frustrating to have to keep things crammed, but at the end of everything, you live under their roof. At least show respect to their propety by communicating before taking action.", "YTA - OP not your house, yes you do pay \"rent\" and gas money, but the least you could do is politely nudge them along these months into making space for you instead of just moving their stuff out on their own.  You wouldn't want it done to you so why would you think they would appreciate it done from you?  They offered you a place to stay at the last minute, you've been living with them for several months and it's likely not been all rainbows and unicorns for them either, but learn to compromise instead of being a bull in a china shop.", "YTA! Move out and get an apartment. You've been working for eight months now and they probably thought your stay would be temporary!", "YTA. Where would you go if it weren't for them? If you have a better option where you'll get all the space you think you deserve you should go there. Otherwise perhaps you should stop and think about the things you have that many others in your position (and income level) don't. A safe place to live with people who care enough about you to have made it work.", "Your actions were very disrespectful, and I personally would've cleared a space to help you find a more suitable living arrangement.  While it may be inconvenient, you're not on the streets. Your grandparents are freaking elderly how about instead of feeling entitled to have a space cleaned.... you do it yourself.

You expecting some pristine sweet room  to stay in was fantasy.   You should have cleaned up the room within the first month you were there.

If she's able bodied enough for that, then she can get her crap out of my room.\n\n3) On a consistent basis, when I come home from work and go to my room, my stuff has been messed with. They go in my room to \"tidy up\" and they throw away what they see fit (ex. my vibrator, a partially broken but still usable hair claw, and a piece of paper that I had written important information on). They keep doing this even though I've asked them not to, multiple times. They don't respect my boundaries whatsoever.\n\n4) average price of a STUDIO APARTMENT in SoCal is 2,000 a month. Ridiculous. Can't afford that. \n\n5) I applied to 42 different places before I finally got hired.

Throwing it on their bed was mad disrespectful. Loving someone does not mean they have to house her. I love tons of people... From across the country.", "YTA - People don't think you're an asshole for wanting more space. They think you're an asshole for being ungrateful and your apparent unwillingness to be part of the solution. \n\nIt sounds like you're lucky to see 10 hours of work a week, which does suck. \n\nBut with all that free time there is no reason you should be relying on a couple of elderly people to clean out the room when as far as we can tell, ain't nothing wrong with your hands. \n\nAnd you're being a brat about it too. If you walked out of that room every day with even one item (240 items) and asked what they want you to do with it, the room would probably be empty. You could probably even get away with whole handfuls of stuff to make the process quicker. \n\nI get that you're probably super stressed and feeling pretty desperate, but there are helpful coping mechanisms available. Blowing up at gramps ain't one of them. \n\nIF you were paying market value for the room I might be more on your side, but you're clearly not. I don't know exactly were you live but I'm guessing renting a room in a house with all bills included is more like $750 and up a month, and ain't nobody giving rides for free with these gas prices, plus cars ain't free or you'd have one. \n\nReal question here, if the room was empty would your stuff be put away clean and organized?\n\nAs for them messing with your stuff, didn't read that in the OP. That legitimately sucks, and I would feel extremely violated. \n\nHowever, maybe if everyone thinks YTA, might consider some self-reflection.", "Not sure where you live but US Federal minimum wage was $7.25 in 2022.

How are so many people missing this when its literally the first sentence?\n\nIts $15.50/hr here in california, and finding a part time job paying $16-17/hr isnt too hard either actually.
