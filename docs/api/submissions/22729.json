Your whole family could decide you aren't comfortable going except as a unit. You could decide you aren't comfortable with your daughter being a flower girl if your son isn't invited too and decline for her (she shouldn't have been asked unless you agreed). Your husband could stay with your son, or with both kids. You could find something your son would love and send him to do that instead. (Is there something in that state that he and his dad would love?) There's a lot of space between him being at the wedding and him being in a hotel room with a stranger to find a third way. \n\nThe couple can plan the wedding they want.

Go or don't, but don't show up to a no kids event with a 4yo.", "You asked if you would be the AH for taking your son to wedding he is not invited to. The answer to that is unequivocally yes. YWBTA if you did.\n\nIs it unusual to only invite one child like this? Ehh, possibly, but not really. The fact that only the kids in the wedding party are invited, but not others, is not unusual. Nor is the fact that only one of your children is involved unusual. I think it's just an unfortunate situation.\n\nYou have a special needs child that you need to arrange care for and that's hard. You can certainly have hubby stay home or you can all bow out, but I don't think your cousin's ask, or expectation of just one of your kids being invited, is odd here.

Honestly, your daughter will be excited for 5 minutes then bored to tears because there's not other kids. Your sister should just forego flower girls (I've seen flower Grandma's at child free weddings) or have a flower girl and ring bearer from the same family to avoid causing this issue. Also, why 2 flower girls and no ring bearer?", "NTA I would be insulted if one of my children was invited to be in the wedding and not the other. She doesn\u2019t want him to be a ring bearer? My cousin had a child free wedding but because her entire family was attending meaning no available babysitters (no one in our family has ever used an outside sitter), she decided to just have all of the close family members\u2019 kids in the wedding ceremony as ring bearers, ring \u201csecurity\u201d & flower girls. I think there were 12 kids total and it was so cute. I personally am so sick of everyone having child-free weddings. We typically don\u2019t go to them.", "If your daughter can be a flower girl, your son should be able to come too IMO\n\nI'd decline to attend personally and they can have their day the way they want.", "Esh. It's ok for autistic kids to be told no and experience disappointment practice is the only way they learn.\n\nThe bride is treating your kids like decorations (\"I want to dress up your girls for my wedding, but their siblings can't come because he won't be useful\" that's fucked up.)", "ESH: it sounds like she has a no autistic kids policy. Even if that\u2019s not the case, she\u2019s an AH for inviting one kid and not the other. YTA because you want to take your son but you haven\u2019t communicated your thoughts and feelings to the bride. You\u2019ve created a scenario in your head that may or may not be true. You\u2019ve also created a false dichotomy where your son stays at home with the babysitter, when it probably makes a lot more sense to either retract your daughter or have your husband stay home from the ceremony and join you at the reception.  There\u2019s also probably your son loves and you could have him go do that instead of sit through a boring wedding ceremony.", "NTA if she wanted child free then stick to child free.

They make sense and anyone looking at the situation from the outside likely sees your logic.  However it isn't your wedding and you can't make up your own rules for attendance.  But you cousin is also an AH in this situation for not considering how that will impact your son and the logistics for anyone in your family to attend. I don't think she really thought that one through.  Might have to have your husband watch your son and just take your daughter to the ceremony and then leave.  There won't be any other kids there for her to play with anyway.", "YWBTA if you brought ur son. YWNBTA if u declined. it is her wedding. but with restrictions she should understand she aint the star nor priority. pick ur battles. if my son didnt have some place to go that was with other kids or supervision. i would decline.", "YTA.

You can bring both kids, and you and hubby can take turns with who is watching the baby and who is watching the flower girl.

You can have a different date night. If you don\u2019t want her to have that experience and you want a date night, have her out of the wedding and get a sitter for both kids. You just can\u2019t bring an uninvited guest!", "NTA I would point out that it\u2019s leaving him out of all y\u2019all go but him, and then if she is still saying he can\u2019t come then just leave him with your husband?", "YTA to do so.  You have a choice - all kids stay home with you or you leave the 4yo alone.", "He\u2019s 4 months old and will literally have no memory of this whatsoever.

Guess he can\u2019t be a lil Best Man or something?", "When I got married I had every little girl in my church, all 8,  dance in the wedding, with choreography and adorable matching dresses. They were the only children invited. I had one of their mothers call me and ask if the older brother could come, and I said \"Sorry, no.\" That was 22 years ago. I don't regret my decision.

How old is your son?", "YWBTA. Your daughter is already excited about her role, and she should be in the wedding. But the bride and groom said no other kids, so bringing your son should not be going. I think in this situation the most fair thing for everyone would be to have your husband stay with your son during the ceremony, and both of the kids for the reception. Honestly, your son might love hanging in a hotel and ordering room service and movies with his dad, way more than a wedding ceremony.

They\u2019ll be no seat for him at the ceremony or at the wedding breakfast. No meal for him. No space for him. How will his big feelings deal with that? YWBTA both to the bride and groom and to your son if you take him when he\u2019s not invited.", "NTA. It's plain weird. No kids, except two little girls. It would be wrong to take him without telling her. But really, it's cruel to restrict one family member from going to an event. Especially on the spectrum. For me you have 3  (right) choices:\n\n1. Tell them to get a different flower girl and don't go. Though you can do this, it will likely cause drama and you will miss out on your cousin's special moment.\n2. Tell them to get a different flower girl and go. Tell them if it's no kids, then you won't take your daughter. Personally though, your daughter might get upset and so will your cousin, but it would be fairer.\n3. Go with all your kids. Tell your cousin that if 2 kids are going, then all kids can. This would lead to similar conflicts though.\n\nIf I was you, I would go route 2 or 3. All of them ends up in a conflict, so approach the situation carefully. Good luck, OP!\n\nEdit: Though flower girls are a special part of a wedding, could it also be discrimination? I s your cousin worried he is going to act out? Are there other kids not invited in your family? And if so who are they? All these questions really impact your decision.", "NTA.  You can not invite one kid to play a key role and ban the other, especially a 4yo.  He could be a ring bearer or \"best boy\".  She's the AH for having a \"no kids\" wedding then inviting just one of your kids to take part.  I'd say both kids take part or none -- you are not playing favorites with your kids.  Most weddings are self-indulgent bullshit with way too much politics, anyway.  It sounds like this one is just that.", "NAH. You might have to miss the wedding (or you husband might). But call your cousin and ask. Maybe there is room in the program for your son too?", "[deleted]", "NTA \n\nI totally understand wanting a no kids wedding but she can't have it both ways. She's putting you in a terrible position inviting two of your kids to participate and excluding your other child from even attending. Also, can't help but wonder if this is in part because of your son's autism. Is she afraid he'll have a tantrum & make a scene because he has special needs? If that's the case she shouldn't have included any of your children. Excluding one kid (especially a kid with special needs) while everyone else gets included is where I draw the line.

Like even if she was an only child, she should have gotten her moms permission before talking to the SIX YEAR OLD idk it's just disrespectful to the parents imo, i would seriously question someone's judgment about what's appropriate to talk to children about without their parents knowledge \n\nAnd that sounds dramatic lmao but it reminds me of the whole \"cool and fun but also irresponsible and manipulative relative that gets a little kids hopes up about something exciting before asking the parents\" trope cos now the parent either has to be the bad guy and disappoint their kid by saying no or is pressured into saying yes so the kid isn't disappointed even though the parent isn't comfortable with it.
