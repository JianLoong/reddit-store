It was an honest mistake not recognizing your nephew, especially given the circumstances of the club and the time that has passed since you last saw him.", "NTA. Not sure what the big fucking deal is to your friend on whether or not you recognized your nephew that  you haven\u2019t seen for 10 years in a club. If that relationship between your nephew and your friend fizzled out, it\u2019s probably because you are his aunt and you saw him clubbing in a place Nani Ji wouldn\u2019t approve of, not because you didn\u2019t recognize him.  I\u2019m guessing he isn\u2019t going to take things further when the backstory isn\u2019t one the family would approve of.", "NTA\n\nPeople would be shocked seeing me last year vs this year. I was looking so gaunt people didn't recognize me. I had some troubles. And 14 years old vs 24 years old is too much a change. I'm surprised your friend didn't recognize your nephew if she's such a good friend. Why is that?", "I wouldn't recognize my niblings out of place either. If you don't see them regularly it's hard. So NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf you have not seen him for almost a decade - how are you meant to instantly recognise him?", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. You were honest to everyone.", "NTA - honest mistake, Shireen needs to chill.", "NTA\n\nSo you last saw him when he was 14yo, and he's 24yo now? \n\nMy kid changed so much between 14yo and 17yo that people had problems recognizing him.

Wait, you didn't recognize someone you hadn't seen in 4 years? I'm not sure why anyone would be angry at you for this.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't recognize him. That is not your fault. I'm sure the club didn't have great lighting and if you have only seen pictures, things aren't gonna click as easily.", "OP=NTA\n\nI presume the club was DARK????\n\nand you haven't seen him in a decade AND you were seeing him OUT OF CONTEXT.\n\nit is natural that you did not recognize him.\n\nSounds like Shireen is embarrassed about the possibility of dating a younger man and is taking it out on you.

She's acting like a child about a non-issue.", "You hadn't seen Arjun since he was 14 and you didn't recognize him.\n\nSome people have better facial recognition skills than I do.  Some people also change a great deal as the become an adult.\n\nYou can't be faulted for not recognizing him.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nPeople can change a lot in 10 years even if you see the occasional photo. I saw some nephews and nieces after just a couple of years and they were almost unrecognizable. If they weren\u2019t at a family party  and going by a different name then  I would not have necessarily recognized them.\n\nIt won\u2019t be your fault if Arjun doesn\u2019t want to see Shireen and it is not because you did not recognize him. It seems like he was more uncomfortable that you might report on his activities to the family.", "NTA. It wouldn't have ended any differently if you had recognized him, he would have just had his meltdown in front of Shirleen.", "Lol nta, it\u2019s a weird thing to see people you know in context you don\u2019t expect to find them in, I would also say like your brain takes time to process the person. I did karate for years seeing people from the dojo outside of the dojo was weird like when did you start wearing normal people clothes, and why aren\u2019t we bowing in to great each other, when do we start trying to punch each other.  For you the last time you saw him he was a 14 yr old child and not going into clubs, so why would you be expecting to see him in a club, the Lego store yes a club no.", "NTA why she pissed, she can still date him? Doesn\u2019t sound like you care?", "NAH, just an awkward social interaction.  Sounds like part of a movie plot.", "NTA \u2014 just talk to your nephew and tell him you approve but won\u2019t say anything. Your sister might be mad when she finds out that you knew and didn\u2019t say anything, but that\u2019s a lesser sin at the end of the day if you think the two of them might be happy dating.", "I think she must have really liked him. She hasn't had the best of luck when it comes to guys.", "He did look just like his pictures. Had she tried to introduce us at a cafe or restaurant or something, I think I would have realized. But we were at a club and it was dark and loud.", "Exactly, I get why she must have liked him. From what I've heard from my mother, I can tell that he's grown to be very similar to her but it's not my fault she decided to try and date my nephew even though she's about four years older than him.", "I don't know why he asked that of me. I doubt my mother would care about him clubbing, I mean my siblings all went clubbing at the same age. I'd guess it's to avoid more drama between my mother and my sister but it's not like there's much of a relationship there.", "My friend has never met my sister or her family. I met Shireen after I took a year off from university after I gave birth. By that time, my sister had already cut off everyone but my mother, and even they still have a very tense barely existent relationship. So, she never met anybody from my sister's family and must have met him some other way.", "Because I've seen recent pictures where he looks just like he does in person.", "She's usually very chill. I guess she must have really liked my nephew.", "Yes, he's 24 now. So the last time I saw him in person was about two months after my marriage when I announced I was pregnant and he looked very different then. The thing is, my mother still shows me photos of him and I saw them about a month ago and he looks how he did in those.", "> Why would this be a reason for your nephew to stop seeing your friend?\n\nHypothetical:\n\nThe person merely *being* his aunt's friend might be enough reason to stop seeing her, in one or the other of their minds.  They might, in theory, be upset that she didn't speak up *earlier* so they could have ended it before they got in as deep as they had.\n\nStill, absolutely NTA.  OP may be catching hell simply because someone can't admit that they're embarrassed by the situation.", "The thing is, I'm not sure if I am all right with him seeing my best friend but I can't do anything about that. I could reach out to him online, my mother follows him on Instagram. But call his mother? That wouldn't work out well for anybody.", "I haven't seen him in ten years, since right after my own wedding. However, my mother does show me photos of him and I have seen those as recent as a month ago.", "She has had a lot of issues with men. She had a fianc\u00e9e but he was horrible in the worst ways. From what my mother's told me about my nephew, I can guess that they'd mesh together well and if they really like each other, she'd be upset about things with him ending just as as they were getting started.", "It\u2019s such a weird thing to get mad at you for, though. I genuinely don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s upset. Is she afraid that you offended your nephew and now he won\u2019t date her?", "Why didn't he greet you by name? Why did he want you to not mention this with his mom?", "What\u2019s wrong with the age gap? I\u2019m four years older than my husband-it\u2019s no big deal.", "Then your friend is unhinged and looking for reasons why your nephew isn\u2019t talking the bait.  He probably thinks hooking up with his aunt\u2019s best friend is ick!  You not recognizing him is a non-factor for everyone who isn\u2019t insane.", "Tell her you\u2019ll put in a good wood for her and maybe she\u2019ll be good", "NTA, i have a lot of trouble recognizing people from photos in real life and the other way around. sometimes even when i know the person better and they show me an older photo. \n\nsometimes its also context. i didnt recognize people i actually now if i meet them in an unexpected setting and it usually takes a few seconds to put everything together in my head.", "It's not that you're not fine with him seeing your best friend, it's the fact your mother and your sister will find out he's seeing your best friend. Is Shireen known to your mother and sister? If they know who Shireen is, Arjun not knowing who Shireen is, doesn't compare to your sister and mother if they find out Arjun is with your best friend.", "Yeah, I have a whole town that's family (1-7th cousins), and I wouldn't recognize any of them that I hadn't interacted with in 10 years.", "She does know about the issues that I have with my sister. Maybe she doesn't want to choose between us, or maybe she knows that this isn't something that I'm going to approve of.", "Shireen's not unhinged, she's usually the calmest out of our friends and has been by my side since we met at university. I think she must have really liked him because the more I think about it, they are really similar (at least based on what my mother tells me).", "Well, that would by lying. I don't know if I approve of this relationship if it does go forward.", "My mother knows Shireen very well. I haven't seen my sister in ten years so the only way they would know about Shireen is if my mother mentioned her but that would be knowing of her, not knowing her.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't want my nephew dating my friend because... let's say they get married. That would make her my niece and if she's in my sister's family, I doubt we'd get to hang out much anymore.", "We\u2019ll call it temporary insanity because her reaction and her behavior, if she is limiting contact with you because of this, is not normal or rational", "Then you need to chill too. Maybe thats why Shireen is mad at you.", "Is that a cultural thing because I don\u2019t see how her being your niece would mean you can\u2019t be friends. I knows guy who\u2019s uncle is his age and they hang out as friends in fact it\u2019s a bit of a joke among the friends group.", "Why would I need to chill? I haven't done anything.", "From a cultural standpoint, not really. It'd be weird to have my nephew keep calling me Massi but her keep calling me by name and then for my kids who call her aunty but she'd technically be their sister-in-law? It's just weird. However, it's more that my sister and I have no relationship and if she'd be with my nephew, I'm certain that it's pretty much be the end of our friendship.", "are they all insane?\n\nyou are NTA.", "And then when she finds out she has a built in 'in' with his family she gets mad at that in? Like, why would she do that?\n\nEmbarrassment is the only reason I can think of unless you were giving her crap about dating someone you still see as a child or something, but you don't mention that in your story.", "Because this is not who she normally is and I do think she's too old for him. She's talked down about age gap relationships in the past but in the wake of her engagement ending a while ago, she's had a bad string of relationships and I do believe that this is just going to be her trying to cling to my nephew.", "In Indian culture, it is considered rude to call relatives elder to you by their name, hence he referred to her as Massi (Aunt on the Mother's Side).\n\nAlso he didn't want OP to mention this to his grandma (OP and her Sister's mother) because she would just have old fashioned views and disapprove of Arjun dating someone 4 years older than him.", "Because it would be disrespectful to call me by my name. And he didn't want me to mention this to my mother, he knows I do not talk to his mother/my sister.", "If they're both happy together, and you've already decided that you're not going to approve of it, *that* makes YTA.\n\n\nDo you have some drastic life-changing information not already in your post you're basing your disapproval on?", "I do not approve of them being together because I do believe she is too old for my nephew and just looking for somebody to cling to given how bad her previous relationships have been. Beyond that, I know that my sister is going to work her best to cut me out of her life and maybe that's selfish but I don't want to lose my friend."]}
