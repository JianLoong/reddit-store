I just wanna say everyone was right. I was an asshole. I was being a pushover. I was being a shit boyfriend and partner. I did prioritize Jess over my girlfriends feelings and that was so shitty of me.\n\nMe and my girlfriend are currently on a break. I tried to apologize to her and make sure she understood that I knew how wrong I was. I told her that I was sorry for letting Jess disrespect her and be catty and that I\u2019d never let that happen again. My girlfriend said that Jess has been like this to her since we started dating and said that I\u2019ve just been either ignoring it or unable to see it. Through a tearful back and forth my girlfriend told me that she wouldn\u2019t let herself feel second to Jess. She said that when I figure out what\u2019s going on there Jess and I, then talk to her but until then she wants to get some distance from our relationship.\n\nSo that evening I was heartbroken, but I wanted to still make it clear to Jess that she would not be disrespectful to my girlfriend if we got back together and that she owes her an apology no matter what. I thought it would be better to have this as a face to face conversation as there\u2019s a lot of ambiguity over text so I went to her place. XShe apologized to me and said she would call my ex to apologize to her. \n\nI got home in the morning I just spent a lot of time reflecting on the bad decisions I had made and how much I hurt my girlfriend and how right everyone who said I was being a shitty boyfriend was.\n\nSo I will admit, I fucked up. I didn\u2019t protect the person I was supposed to protect. I was too blind to see Jess being catty and mean to her. If she takes me back that won\u2019t ever happen again.", "created_utc": 1695499399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qdt2s/update_aita_for_telling_my26m_girlfriend_that/", "score": 324, "replies": ["[Original Post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f3t7x/aita_for_telling_my26m_girlfriend_that_she25f/)", ">So that evening...

If Jess really has been as catty and disrespectful as your gf says, it's pretty much guaranteed that any unsupervised \"apology\" Jess would give would be half-assed at best and more likely the apology itself would be another dig or catty remark. Basically, by trusting Jess to apologize without you standing there watching what she said, you left it wide open for Jess to make shit even worse.\n\nActually, by not cutting Jess out as a friend, you've made it clear to your gf that she's not your priority and never will be. (\"when you figure out what's going on between you and Jess...\" is code for: Pick her or me)\n\nYou fucked up.\n\nThen you fucked up again by the way you handled the fallout. \n\nHope you didn't really want to be with your gf because you blew it.", "What were u doing at Jess\u2019 overnight?", "why didnt you just idk,,, call jess??? why did you spend the night? are you going to keep that a secret from your xgf? what even is your xgfs name? between two posts its jess jess jess jess je", "*< So that evening I was heartbroken, but I wanted to still make it clear to Jess that she would not be disrespectful to my girlfriend if we got back together and that she owes her an apology no matter what.

Usually when a GF is feeling disrespected by that oh so sweet angelic friend that their guy thinks is one of the best things next to apple pie, there IS an actual reason for it.  A common theme crops up where many men are unaware and oblivious to the sophisticated ways that many women fight or get competitive, especially when a guy they are close to, brings a girlfriend into the group.  There are ways to subtly pick at and annoy someone\u2019s GF, and set it all in a way that looks like they are just trying to help, or just making jokes and are oh so innocent while the girlfriend looks like a devil.   Sometimes the gestures are as subtle as turning back to the gf while interacting in an extra bubbly fashion to designate a feeling of exclusion, or other body languages.  And these type of women are usually the bubbliest ones in the crowd constantly vying for attention AKA \u201cPick Me\u201d girls.    \n\nFor your GF to call her the \u201cPick Me\u201d, there had to have been problems from the getgo, but she gets along fine with all the other women and gfs in the group; I bet there is a laundry list of scenarios far greater than your list.   She\u2019s just had enough of trying to talk to you about it for you to dismiss her with raving about how Jess isn\u2019t like that, she\u2019s so wonderful, or accusing her of having an issue because they have similar personalities.   And using your intimate time for a punchline as a joke at the breakfast table??  Really??  You seriously had the nerve to tell your gf to apologize for blowing up about this after finally being pushed over the edge by being made the brunt of a very crude joke?  Maybe you didn\u2019t mind but she clearly did.  I mean she literally likened your noises (both of you) to the sounds of zoo animals.  She was probably mimicking you guys too just to elevate the laughter.  How incredibly humiliating for your gf!  Then to add insult to injury you wanted your gf to belly up and apologize for her reactions to this very deliberate act of humiliation.  Nice friends you pick. Let that sink in.\n\nAnd breaks?  More often than not, breaks are bridges to permanent break ups, just that either one or the other isn\u2019t comfortable doing a full blown break up so they think this eases the pain.  It doesn\u2019t.  Your friend likely costed you a relationship (not that she minds but she will pretend to).  But if you continue to hang with her, and your new girl has concerns, learn to listen and take them seriously just like you would want if she had a guy friend pulling things you notice but she\u2019s obvious to.", "Got home in the morning... from...where?", "Sorry, still TA. \n\nIf I found out my exbf was trying to get me back but hey spent the night drinking with the person responsible for making him said ex....he's staying right in the ex zone.\n\nPoor decision.

Ya your gf should break up with you permenantly, especially when she finds this out.", "Your ex gave you a second chance and then you immediately threw it into a dumpster. Please let her go and go date Jess, you clearly value her much more than the girl you supposedly love. From the comments you made about Jess being \"too tempting\" it's clear that you love her. You shouldn't even have to choose if you truly loved your ex. Hope she walks away from you, she deserves much better", "Lmao dude, the \u201cbreak\u201d is her dumping you with extra steps. Least now you can have lots of overnight face to face w Jess.", "YTA for shagging jess the moment you and your ex girlfriend were \"on a break\"", "So, did you tell your girlfriend you had sex with Jess?", "It's good to see you realized you messed up and tried to apologize. But OP, as much as you care about both of them, you cannot keep both. I say this because it's pretty clear as day. \n\n* Your (ex?) girlfriend told you not to call her until you figure out what's going on there with you and Jess. She still thinks there's something between you two. It's pretty obvious to her and everyone else where Jess stands, and your actions showed she can't trust you to not reciprocate whatever signals is Jess sending.\n* You went to Jess's house personally to talk instead of calling her, and got wasted. The two of you drinking heavily and not establishing firm boundaries during the trip contributed to the original problem. \n* Jess has been acting this way since YOU STARTED DATING. That's not just inappropriate, mean, and catty. *That's calculated abuse*. \n\nEven if Jess says she'll call and apologize to your (still nameless) girlfriend, there's a chance she'll probably use the fact that you went over and got drunk at her house after the break up against her.  It's clear Jess has some kind of feelings regarding you and you gave her ammunition. Now you're going to have to face the fallout of whatever happens with that phone call. \n\nIf you don't get back together with your gf, and eventually start dating again, there's no guarantee that Jess won't do the same thing again to any future partners. This entire situation just proves that Jess can get away with anything and everything, and that you'll let her. \n\nIf you don't want that, this is what you'll need to: \n\n1. Cut her out. Completely. Delete her contact info. Block her number. Do not hang out with her. If she shows up somewhere you are, leave. If she shows up at your place, kick her out. She needs to face consequences for her abuse towards your girlfriend, and you need to start setting very firm boundaries about what is and isn't appropriate behavior towards your partners. \n2. Seek some kind of therapy or counseling to cut down on your drinking. Not only did it contribute to your girlfriend's choice to go on a break/break up, but it's becoming a crutch already for when you're in emotional distress. That's not healthy. That's not safe. And it will affect all your relationships going forward if you don't nip it in the bud now. \n\nI truly do wish you well OP and hope things change for the better for you. And I wish your (ex?) girlfriend well. \n\nWhatever happens next, take what you learn from here and use it to improve yourself and your relationships going forward.", "  Yay  I mummy\nN\u00fb you\n Can I y kI betk", "I went back and read the original post, and I'm still not really getting how Jess was catty.

Really, I think it would be in your best interest to heal and work hard on yourself before bringing another romantic partner into your life.  You need to do a lot of self reflecting too about ALL those times you dismissed your gf complaints about Jess.  You need to learn how to properly set boundaries with friends; boundaries you can be trusted to stick to and not use excuses to flout.  Did you have no guy friends, or any friends of either gender your gf liked and trusted enough to go sleep over at to drown in your sorrows?  Why, out of ALL your friends did it have to be the one woman that systematically set the motions to cause the break up, as she calculated you accurately enough to know you were too oblivious and too blind to see what she was up to?   That\u2019s very telling ya know! And again you played right into her hand.   Many mature men and women are actually able to maintain friendships AND relationships where neither has to be excluded from their life in order to do so.  It\u2019s called setting proper boundaries and listening if something feels off about a particular friend.  You need to figure out how to do this.  Also, what kind of friend continuously annoys a guys gf to the point of break up?  She she damn well what would happen when she did her zoo animal sound \u201cjoke\u201d.   That\u2019s why she did it.  That was 100% set up to full on humiliate your gf while looking innocent of wrong doing in the process.

She wouldn\u2019t have pulled them in the first place.", "No you don't. You only care about you.
