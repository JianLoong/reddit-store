She didn't anticipate her relationship would end so quickly and she'd return to her hometown. You weren't cat sitting for her until she found a place that would accept cats, she gave you the cat. This woman can scream, stamp her feet and make all the threats she wants, it's not her cat anymore.", "NTA. She made the decision to rehome the cat, so the cat stopped being hers the minute you took Mina in. Yes, she had the cat for years, so why didn't she make the effort to keep her? Years ago, friends were moving and couldn't take their cat initially, since they didn't yet have a permanent address. I took him in as a kitty boarder and bonded with him and was really sad to send him back to them, but that was always the agreement. Because they loved their cat and he was part of their family, so they didn't simply rehome him. H did not treat Mina like a member of her family. Of course, she can't have her back.", "NTA, you\u2019ll win In court if she takes you, she gave up her cat, which is property. I would be careful letting her come over too.", "I may get down voted but yta. U talk about how u bonded but like u don't think she bonded with the cat since she had it longer? Having to get rid of pet uve had for yrs is awful. Id say give the cat back", "NTA \nThe cat is yours , she choose to give up no matter what the situation was , she was selfish \n\nShe wants the cat back because the relationship didnt work out and she is lonely, What if they get back together will she give her away again?\n\nThe cat has a stable and loving home with you and she deserves that! Let your sister and her friend be mad , they aren\u2019t entitled to the cat just because it convenient for her now", "NTA. Cats are attached to places not people. \n\nAlso your cat's have bonded. Seperating them now would be fucked up. \n\nI agree it's best for Mina to get her cat back. \n\nIt's not best for the car's to be split up and the rehomed cat to have to shift again. \n\nYou abandoned an animal for a boy. You can't take them in and throw them out based on your mood. She can't handle being a pet parent. She shouldn't be one. She can come visit the cat etc but she isn't taking it home. \n\nI suggest you get that new cat microchipped with your name. Most vets do it and it's painless to the animal. Will help if you ever get dragged to court. \ud83d\ude09", "NTA \n\nWhile I\u2019m sorry for H, she made her choice. Pets are forever, and she gave Mina up.\n\nWhat matters most is what\u2019s best for Mina, and it sounds like that is staying with you", "NTA and I agree with every point you made. By going to the vet, I hope you also got her chipped or updated her chip info to yours. \n\nI would probably stop communicating with Mina and tell your sister that she needs to keep her relationship with Mina separate from her relationship with you.\n\nAlso, if you haven't already, save all communications about her rehoming this cat to you, all your vet bills, and other purchases to have proof ready in case she does try to take you to small claims.", "NTA\n\nThe cat is yours. Poor planning on her part does not constitute an emergency on your part. Let her take you to court. She will loose.\n\nEnjoy the kitty.", "NTA. \n\nShe didn't ask you to board- she gave you the cat. \nIt is yours now. \n\n(Fyi..24/7 cat boarding is usually about $50 a day, plus all supplies and vet care).", "NTA. She gave up the cat when it was inconvenient to her, and now wants it back? Cats aren\u2019t like toys you can put away and pick back up. \n\nBut that said, you could also consider some sort of time share (Mina should hopefully be happy in either household since she knows H), coming up with some way to let Mina pick.", "NTA. Rehome is meant to be permanent, it seems that was the agreement in this situation. The fact that her reason for needing the rehome didnt work out and she wants to cancel it months later doesnt change that, especially if you dont also agree. Most importantly, it wouldnt be the best thing for the cat to suddenly change to an environment after that have adapted when its not needed.", "NTA.  H can get another cat.  There are thousands of cats available in shelters.", "NTA if the thing with the BF worked out this would not even be up for discussion. mina is your cat now that's what re home means. giving them a new home not pet sitting.", "NTA, you can't change your mind after that long.\n\nJust so you know though, cats are absolute mercenaries. If you were gone for a few days and someone else was giving her cat food, she'd be snuggling up to that person and sleeping in bed with them like they were BFFs for years. Bottom line is the cat would be fine either way, but in this case it's not theirs to take back.", "NTA.   She gave you the cat because she was moving away. \nLet your  sister be mad.", "NTA. You are 100% correct, rehomed means that you adopted her. Your home is her home. She can't expect you to give back the cat that you've bonded with and made a part of your family just because her life circumstances changed and she wants her back. You're doing the right thing and she's being entitled and immature about this.", "nta but maybe get the cat chipped or something she might try to steal it or even your sister might do it for her also maybe a camera or something so you have proof if they do better safe than sorry", "It's not \"a couple of months\".  It's more like half a year.  Mina is now your cat.  Let H go ahead and try to take you to court.  She doesn't have a leg to stand on.  If your sister is too obtuse to see how messed up H is being, then enjoy the silence her \"silent treatment\" is bringing lol.  You are not a cat thief.  She basically abandoned her cat for a dude.  She's a bad cat mom.  \n\nNTA, not even a little bit.", "And what city/state doesn\u2019t allow cats?", "NTA. Especially since you have the age and sex of each cat. \n\nBut really\u2026 you did your best to take care of them when the previous owner gave up. You are the owner now.", "H chose her boyfriend over Mina and now that the relationship has ended thinks she can snap her fingers and get her back because, now like before, this is about her and not about Mina.  You are doing the right thing for Mina.  Don't back down.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister is being selfish. Every time that cat changes hands or moves, it's stressful. The cat is happy where it is, she isn't entitled to the cat.\n\nYour sister is an asshole though. She abandoned her pet she had for five years only to show up months later expecting to just get the cat back. \n\nWhen I need to move, my pets come with me. They're family. I would never consider abandoning them.", "Oh please. Think of the CAT, not weird human-made ideas of whose 'property' the animal should be. This is a LIVING, BREATHING creature, with EMOTIONS. Not a discarded, inanimate doll. \n\nThis cat has already been through a stressful transition, and is now settled. Put the cat through another change, and it will suffer more stress. I have cats - and I've seen how bonded pairs suffer, when they are separated.\n\nPlus, H dumped the cat when it suited. Is she really the best choice of 'owner' for this cat? The cat's only 5. What happens when H finds a new partner, or perhaps gets back with the ex? Or wants to move out to a pet-free apartment, or work a job that makes it difficult to care for the cat?\n\nShe's demonstrated when she has a 'better offer', the cat is dumped. OP has shown she is willing to do the legwork, and stick with the cat even when it's inconvenient (such as the relationship with her sister being damaged). The cat should stay with OP.", "If she was so attached to the cat she wouldn't have given her up to chase some dude.   I never would have given away any of my pets for anyone.", "Its so awful that it shouldn't have happened to begin with. I've had pets my entire life and I've never once given them away.", ">don't think she bonded with the cat since she had it longer\n\nClearly not enough to find solutions to keep her. She just dumped the cat to go after a relationship that didn't work in another town. The cat deserves better than being a toy that is abandoned when Mina is done playing with it.", "It was the sister's friend H who gave up her cat for a dude, not the sister.  H is totally an asshole though.  And the sister isn't much better, taking H's side over the OP.", "Ok", "Ok", "That's good for u. But sometimes ppl move and aren't able to take them for a bunch of reasons. And it sucks.", "That's not always possible. Just cause u want to keep ur cat doesn't mean it always will be possible. It's not being a toy. No need to be dramatic.", "Good people do that. OPs asshole sister ditched the cat for a sketchy realtionship.\n\nYou're an asshole for siding with such a selfish shallow person.", ">That's not always possible\n\nThere are always ways if you really love your pet. Unless someone put a gun to her head and forced her to move ? Then ok. But I doubt it's the case. She made her decision, and left her cat behind. So yeah, she could have kept her pet. She chose not to.", "> There are always ways if you really love your pet.\n\nBullshit. \n\n>Unless someone put a gun to her head and forced her to move\n\nI mean, a shitload of people are put in the position of having to move or be homeless every single day. And being homeless isn't an option with or without a pet. \n\n>She made her decision\n\nYou have no idea what her circumstances were. I mean, shit, she could have been in an abusive relationship where there *actually was* a threat of violence involved in her decision to move! You have no idea! You just decided without any information regarding her circumstances that she must have been able to do more, but you actually are just making it up. Neither of us actually knows anything about her decision.", "... there we go. Inventing a tons of possible scenario where H would be the victim. We could probably make up a scenario where OP is a cat burglar and she got through H's chimney to steal it too. Why would we even go there ?! 10438943 scenarios are possible. We have to do with what OP gave us. If it's not clear for you, ask for more info.\n\nThe facts remains : she had a cat. She moved aways and gave the cat away. She came back and had a change of heart. Too bad for her : the cat is not hers anymore. OP has no obligation to give it back. \n\nThe cat deserves stability. What will happen next year when H finds another bf and can't be bothered to find a way to bring the cat with her ?", "> Inventing a tons of possible scenario where H would be the victim.\n\nScenarios where H *could* be a victim, sure, because we don't know anything about H's decisions. My scenarios are just as possible as yours, which you also invented out of whole cloth. \n\n>We have to do with what OP gave us.\n\nYes, which did not include any indication that the assumptions you made are true. We cannot just assume that H moved just for yucks and didn't give a shit about the cat. OP never said that. \n\n>If it's not clear for you, ask for more info.\n\nI would put to you that it's you who should ask more info. I'm not assuming anything. I'm not saying my possible scenarios must be true, I'm saying you have no fucking idea whether they're true or not. You know as much as I know, which is nothing at all about why she moved.\n\n>The facts remains \n\nNo, the fact doesn't remain. You say she definitely could have done more, but you have no clue. Neither of us knows. Maybe you're right, maybe you're fucking wrong as shit, but don't pretend you have a way to be certain. \n\n>OP has no obligation to give it back.\n\nThis has no bearing on whether or not H could have done more or whether or not there was a gun to H's head. You don't fucking know, and it's whack as hell to pretend like you do.", "Funny how you just put the bit \"The facts remains : \" while not citing the facts that I stated after and making it about something else entirely.\n\nSo I'll just say that. Let's say that poor H was FORCED to move because her old appartment was destroyed in a fire, and she was homeless for 2 months, shoeless, in the snow, before finally moving in with her abusive bf that put a gun to her head and stated that the cat needed to go. \n\nThat doesn't change 1 fact : she gave the cat away to OP. She didn't ask her to petsit the cat for a while. She gave it away. It's not hers anymore and OP has no obligation, legal or moral, to give it back. It's her cat now. Period."]}
