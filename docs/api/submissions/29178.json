This woman can scream, stamp her feet and make all the threats she wants, it's not her cat anymore.", "NTA. She made the decision to rehome the cat, so the cat stopped being hers the minute you took Mina in. Yes, she had the cat for years, so why didn't she make the effort to keep her? Years ago, friends were moving and couldn't take their cat initially, since they didn't yet have a permanent address. I took him in as a kitty boarder and bonded with him and was really sad to send him back to them, but that was always the agreement. Because they loved their cat and he was part of their family, so they didn't simply rehome him. H did not treat Mina like a member of her family. Of course, she can't have her back.", "NTA, you\u2019ll win In court if she takes you, she gave up her cat, which is property. I would be careful letting her come over too.", "I may get down voted but yta. U talk about how u bonded but like u don't think she bonded with the cat since she had it longer?

Let your sister and her friend be mad , they aren\u2019t entitled to the cat just because it convenient for her now", "NTA. Cats are attached to places not people. \n\nAlso your cat's have bonded. Seperating them now would be fucked up. \n\nI agree it's best for Mina to get her cat back. But Mina can go suck it.\n\nIt's not best for the cat's to be split up and the rehomed cat to have to shift again. \n\nShe abandoned an animal for a boy. She can't take them in and throw them out based on her mood. She can't handle being a pet parent. She shouldn't be one. She can come visit the cat etc but she isn't taking it home. \n\nI suggest you get that new cat microchipped with your name. Most vets do it and it's painless to the animal.

By going to the vet, I hope you also got her chipped or updated her chip info to yours. \n\nI would probably stop communicating with H and tell your sister that she needs to keep her relationship with H separate from her relationship with you.\n\nAlso, if you haven't already, save all communications about her rehoming this cat to you, all your vet bills, and other purchases to have proof ready in case she does try to take you to small claims.\n\nEdit: corrected names from Mina to H.", "NTA\n\nThe cat is yours.

Rehome is meant to be permanent, it seems that was the agreement in this situation. The fact that her reason for needing the rehome didnt work out and she wants to cancel it months later doesnt change that, especially if you dont also agree.

If you were gone for a few days and someone else was giving her cat food, she'd be snuggling up to that person and sleeping in bed with them like they were BFFs for years.

She offered to take him back if we neutered him. Meanwhile we are thinking there is no way in hell we trust her and she should not have pets. Either I would adopt him or he would be adopted out into a loving responsible home. You don\u2019t rehome baby kittens for accidents and you don\u2019t move them around.

Mina deserves someone who'll be there for her in the long haul, not a flighty person who'll ditch her for the first guy to give her a second glance.", "NTA. I get H's feelings. I do. Years ago, there was two abandoned kittens just left in our apartment building's hallway. Little sweeties. Roommate and I fell in love. However, our apartment wasn't zoned for pets, so keeping them would be against our lease. We did put ourselves on a list for a larger apartment in one of the pet-friendly buildings, but in the meantime we gave the cats to my parents' to help take care of them. However, after about 6 months and no signs of us getting the other apartment, the choice was made for my parents to keep them. At that point, the cats were used to them and the other animals they owned, and it wouldn't be fair for them to be uprooted from that at whenever point we got the other apartment. As it was, took us almost a full year after finding them to get that new apartment. I still saw the two kitties whenever I went to my parents' (roommate did too when she had the chance up until we gave them up), roommate brought in a new cat soon afterwards, and things worked out. But it still sucked to give them up all because of circumstances beyond our control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I get it. But in the end, what matters most is that Mina is safe and healthy. And it seems that she found that with you and yours. 6 months may not seem long to humans, but it's a lifetime to a cat. And she can and will remember the stress of being moved about new locations and such, which is terrible on any cat, but especially an older cat. Speaking from experience. Such things can cause PTSD and abandonment issues, and that can be very hard to try and overcome again. You're doing what's right for Mina, and it's unfortunate that it does come at the expense of H's feelings.

You can't do that to people when they have taken an animal.", "NTA. To truly judge we would need to know the exact wording of the agreement when H moved out. If it was apparent that she was giving up this cat permanently, then she should not expect to get it back. She should consider herself lucky that someone who would provide genuine care for the cat was available to take it in. I understand her remorse given the duration, and I can understand her asking for it back on the off chance you would allow it.

Like print off several copies and keep them around your house, keep one in the car with you etc etc that records prove ownership.

She'd ask after it. \n\nPeople like this DISGUST me. Do not allow her any kind of access to your living space, & if the cat also goes outdoors, be super cautious. Hopefully if there's a chip, it has your name there, not hers. Sidenote: I would NEVER given up any of my beloved cats, nor would I ever, EVER, for some male. GTF Outta here.

The garbage truck is Armegeddon each week. Another cat is what noise? I don't hear anything? \n\nSo ymmv, but wanted to mention this in light of OPs, what I see, as uncaring ex-cat owner.

Ok... whatever floats your boat. That's kinda not the point here. But hey, you do you. \n\nWe'll have to agree to disagree. I am convinced that if you love your pet, you find a way. \n\nIn the present situation, H just went away. She didn't ask OP if she could watch the cat while she figured out how to get her back. She just gave the cat away to OP without bothering trying to setup a way to keep ownership of the cat. She had no intention to take her back when she gave her away. She just... gave her away. She didn't call to get news of the cats, she didn't visit. She just left. And when things go conveninent for her, she wanted the cat back. That's just selfish. \n\nI don't think pets are toys you can play with. When you adopt one, it's for life. If you have to walk away, you figure out a way to get them back."]}
