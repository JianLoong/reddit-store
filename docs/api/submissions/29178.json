H contacted me and asked for Mina back since it\u2019s \u201cbeen only a few months.\u201d\n\nI told her no, since everyone has grown attached to her and invested a lot of time and money into her transition into our lives.

I took him in as a kitty boarder and bonded with him and was really sad to send him back to them, but that was always the agreement.

We did put ourselves on a list for a larger apartment in one of the pet-friendly buildings, but in the meantime we gave the cats to my parents' to help take care of them. However, after about 6 months and no signs of us getting the other apartment, the choice was made for my parents to keep them. At that point, the cats were used to them and the other animals they owned, and it wouldn't be fair for them to be uprooted from that at whenever point we got the other apartment. As it was, took us almost a full year after finding them to get that new apartment. I still saw the two kitties whenever I went to my parents' (roommate did too when she had the chance up until we gave them up), roommate brought in a new cat soon afterwards, and things worked out. But it still sucked to give them up all because of circumstances beyond our control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I get it. But in the end, what matters most is that Mina is safe and healthy. And it seems that she found that with you and yours. 6 months may not seem long to humans, but it's a lifetime to a cat. And she can and will remember the stress of being moved about new locations and such, which is terrible on any cat, but especially an older cat. Speaking from experience. Such things can cause PTSD and abandonment issues, and that can be very hard to try and overcome again. You're doing what's right for Mina, and it's unfortunate that it does come at the expense of H's feelings. But she made the choice to give up Mina; she doesn't have the right to just take Mina back because circumstances changed.", "NTA\n\nyou re homed the cat, not fostered her. You can't do that to people when they have taken an animal.", "NTA. To truly judge we would need to know the exact wording of the agreement when H moved out. If it was apparent that she was giving up this cat permanently, then she should not expect to get it back. She should consider herself lucky that someone who would provide genuine care for the cat was available to take it in. I understand her remorse given the duration, and I can understand her asking for it back on the off chance you would allow it. But in light of hearing \u201cno\u201d she needs to move on.", "NTA - she gave it up for adoption because of what ever reason for moving (no way she couldn\u2019t take the cat, probably chose a boy instead). Where I am pets are classified as property, it would be like her selling you a TV and asking for it back months later. What\u2019s to stop her from doing this again?", "The bigger issue to me would be separating cats who have bonded. I would never do that unless there wasn't another option. Cats are colony creatures.

They are buddies now.", "NTA.\n\nMina is your cat. It would absolutely be unfair for Mina to go through yet another transition, particularly as she's going into her senior cat years.

Her cat has moved on, just like her ex.", "NTA. Sounds like she gave up the cat indefinitely, wasn\u2019t planning on taking her back and the only reason she is asking her back is because things didn\u2019t work out. I would never do this to my pets and would find a way to take them with me. The fact she didn\u2019t tells me everything I need to know about how she feels about her pets: disposable. Stand your ground, it probably sucks but you\u2019re 100% in the right.", "NTA - you are not a car thief you are a CAT HERO.  Cats and dogs are family.

Refuse to talk about it! She can go ahead and pay for a court date so you guys can go and you can prove it your cat. If I were you I would keep copies of vet records easily accessible. Like print off several copies and keep them around your house, keep one in the car with you etc etc that records prove ownership. In many states and even countries pets are property and by taking them to the vet it shows your ownership. Make sure you get her microchipped and it registered to you. \n\nShe's your cat!

I once took my neighbours cat in for 6 months after she had a terrible car accident and needed to stay a while in hospital followed by rehab. He took a while to get warm with us just like Mia did and when the time came for him to go back home he couldn't handle it.

Being awful doesn\u2019t change the fact that H rehoused the cat.", "I'll add though that hopefully she can come visit her after things have settled down because I'm sure Mina would love to see her again :(", "100% shit I had 3 dogs when I moved in with my partner, unfortunately lost my old boy 2 weeks after due to cancer, but you can\u2019t just give up an animal for a few months before you break up and ask for it back it doesn\u2019t work like that at all", "If I ever had to choose my cats or a guy\u2026 yeah sorry dude, I\u2019m keeping my boys thank you", "And dumped it for  a guy.  So the cat should suffer?", "I would be willing to pay that kind of money to get back my cat if someone had her (if I had it ahahaaaa) but H doesn\u2019t seem like that kind of cat owner\u2026 and I cannot imagine rehoming my baby for anything less than deathly emergency tbh", "As I said the asshole tax is usually so high that it scares people away. I would argue for $10,000.... As for Mina, we all know what is best, that H doesn't get her back and she remains in her new loving home", "If anything, that's on the low end.", "this is such a nuclear take and assumes way too much about the other party...\n\nim sure she was giving it a perfectly fine home before, why don't you calm down?", "H's reasons for not taking Mina sound like a lot of excuses. There's no reason any of that wouldn't be workable. She didn't want the hassle and would likely dump the cat again the next time it became a burden. \n\nIt's a living creature, not a sofa or refrigerator.", "I brought my two cats back with me when I moved from England back to the States. No way, was I leaving them behind.", "I took back my Koi fish when I went back to home country after my uni. It's 3 hours long flight and needed tons of paper works and preperation. Alot of people were like it's just a fish.", "Exactly! She chose to move somewhere she couldn't bring her cat. That was her choice and her choice to find a new home for her cat. Just because her situation has changed doesn't mean she gets to \"uno reverse\".  She made a bad decision,  she gets to deal with the consequences.", "im currently moving to another continent and people always ask me what i\u2019m doing about my two cats and im like ??? all their paperwork is sorted and they\u2019re coming with! if they can\u2019t go then i can\u2019t go. i never even considered an alternative.", "Only reason I could think about is when someone in my family suddenly gets really sick bc of our cat, but I'd probably still find a way to keep him\ud83d\ude05", "Same. Hubby and Son and I lived in the crappiest apartment for 4 years because it was one of the only cat friendly places we found. I mean,  it was livable and still expensive as hell but we got to bring our old boy.", "No fucking way. My dog is 17 and she has traveled the country with me. She\u2019s even flown on planes with me. We have lived in 6 states together and have traveled to 24 in her 17 years!", "I completely agree, my oldest dog is a grumpy boy and he has bonded with my bf, he hated my ex who I got him with but I would never \"get rid of him\" my bf is scared to touch my dog In anyway that he has to get too close . Like give him medicine directly Into his mouth but even he loves him and would never even suggest letting him go", "I'll fix that, lol.", "So much this. Laws of many places give animal in question to whoever holds the registered microchip.\n\nNTA OP. H wanted her bread buttered on both sides... freedom without the poor kitty, but demand her kitty back when it suits her. Yikes.", "trying to act like it's fucking impossible for the cat to move back in with its previous owner...give me a break. It's possible.", "So long as we agree. I suppose there\u2019s some truth to putting your money where your mouth is.", "Yup, not easy but worth it! Moved my two dogs and cat (by myself no less as husband had gone ahead) from Korea back to the US when I got married.", "Oof, that must have been a big operation. How big were they? And those people have no idea how old those fish can get, and how the fish are smarter than most people give the credit for.", "I get that. Ppl don\u2019t understand they got personality. Mine was a huge beta pervert that liked to watch ppl undress I caught him doing this while I was changing and tested them lol \n\nHe also loved being petted and knew my eraser was a toy for him and pretended to flair up (won\u2019t do it if he\u2019s not feeling it) I loved him so much and cried horribly when he died.", "Her situation hasn't even resolved itself as she's still temporarily living with mum and hasn't found a new apartment yet.", "Naturally the cat can go climb Mt. Everest if it wants. The fuck's your problem?", "It's around 10 inches, luckily it wasn't fully grown at that time. It had to put in super dural plastic bag which looked kind of like a box and sealed with enough oxygen. I couldnt do it by myself so I had to ask an aquarirum dealer.  And it needed to be done just before I checkin to maintain temperature and oxygen. Then put in styrofoam box  then again in luggage then checkin as baggage.", "They sure like being petted. Also know the feeding time, it will swim up to the surface.", "Seconding the different personalities. One of my parents\u2019 cats took weeks being scared of her new *food bowl*, the other climbed a ladder meant for humans and started a grudge against a ceiling fan, loves strangers and the outdoors, and climbs on new furniture to assert dominance (my own girl is somewhere in the middle lol). So it\u2019s very possible that this commenter has had cats that don\u2019t care about moving the furniture around, while still being a bad assumption that all cats would be chill with that sort of thing!", "I'm saying your overblowing it. You're exaggerating about the attachment issues & safety concerns.", "You're entitled to read my words & come to the conclusion current research is inaccurate. Take it up with them."]}
