Now, my father left the house to me, I have an older brother who I still live with and we have decided to sell the house because we eventually plan to start our own lives in the future. We're still both in uni, and I am doing my final year and he is finishing his honors, so the reasoning is, we no longer have to keep the house because it is in a rather jobless area and if we are to find work, we would have move to an entirely different state. So we want to get rid of all ties, such as property from another state.\n\nNow, once the house is sold, we need to buy a new one elsewhere obviously or get an apartment/flat, but my sister insists that we share the money we get from selling the house with her because she also \"grew up in that house\". But the money is designated for yet another house, and splitting it would not help those losing a home. She already has her own house with her husband and kids, and we would be left stranded after selling the house. She's also moving to another state because of a job and would not even be there when we are homeless. She claims we are selfish for this decision, are we?

My mom and dad took in their child and brought him up until the kid was old enough to come back from school and be home alone. That's when they could take the kid back and continue where my parents left off. And my mother is a stay-at-home mom, so their childs' welfare was my dad's responsibility. Even when they had a second child, my parents did the same thing for the child as well. They never had to look after their kids when they were babies. My dad gave them a fridge when their fridge died, he helped them settle into their new place by helping her husband weed, paint, install house plugs, borrowed them his tools, etc. He did lots of things for her when she lived with us and after she had moved out. During the time for which she lived with us, she would disrespect him, call him names, steal and sell his belongings and the like. She was a young adult then, and I'm sure she was going through a rebellious stage, but the fact that he never saw her differently to us says a lot about how loved her.  \n\n\nThe other day, she had the nerve to say it to me and my brother's face that he was not even her real dad, he was just a step dad to her.
