Not only does she pick at me and my SIL when my husband was 18 she and my FIL divorced. Since then FIL has remarried and is still happily married with his new wife while MIL had spent nearly a decade it a bum of a boyfriend that none of us care for. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s bitter about how her ex is happy with a new partner and knows we all love her and we massively despise her boyfriend, but I digress. \n\nAfter events following our wedding she tries to drive away FIL\u2019s wife and her family from family functions. But despite her efforts step-MIL and her family has been present in my daughters life and love her to pieces, they are her family anyway. MIL refuses to accept this. So my daughters first birthday was coming up and in an effort to avoid drama from MIL I decided to exclude her from the big party with all the extended family and friends and one small separate bash just for her. Thought my plan was fool proof. I even went to my husband and his brothers and asked them specifically not to tell her about the big party. \n\nMy daughter\u2019s actual birthday came around and had our small private party with MIL and things went tolerable. Then comes the day of the big party. I was getting everything set up and from the kitchen I hear a unwelcome voice come through the front door, it\u2019s the MIL! I honestly don\u2019t know how she found out but now I\u2019m stressed. Luckily at this point not very many guests have shown up yet. I call her over to talk privately in the garage. I politely told her that since my husband\u2019s step mom and step sisters family was coming, she would have to either be nice to all of them or she would need to leave. I just didn\u2019t want my daughter\u2019s party to have unnecessary drama. She refused.

So I asked her to leave. She still refused. So sadly I had to call for a police officer to escort her out and she proceeds to cause a scene, screaming to the neighbors that the officer was brutalizing her (he was barely guiding her with his hand on her back, no cuffs) and that I\u2019m keeping her granddaughter away from her and I was kidnapping my own child.

Also, so sorry that it came to the point of cops being involved. But you are your daughter\u2019s mother.

Even if she disagreed with leaving, she should have.\n\nThe only suggestion I have on what could have been done different (without knowing every detail) is to sit and talk with her beforehand. Sometimes the respect & attempt of a conversation can go a long way. If you\u2019d never tried before, I don\u2019t know if you have.

Perhaps with your husband agreeing to LC, things will get more peaceful.  However, if she accuses you or your SIL falsely of child abuse ever again, I would take her butt to court and sue her.  She needs a serious lesson.  I've had CPS called on me by my ex-husband falsely and the repercussions are horrific.  That cannot be tolerated ever.

Just because someone raised you doesn\u2019t make them good parents\u2026\n\nIt also says something about him if he lets her treat you this way.

I never want to put him in a position to chose me or the woman who raised him. And mostly he chooses to be oblivious to the way she treats me.\n\nOP this is very bad.  It's time for your husband to choose a side (his brother as well by the sounds) and you should be asking him to choose you and your daughter (and future kids) or his mum because at the moment all your MIL is doing is ruining your marriage and your family", "He married you, with your vows he has chosen you - or at least he should have done...\n\nIt should never have got to this stage. He should be dealing with her and putting her in her place. That he isn't is just giving her the green flag to carry on. \n\nPeople get divorced over less and you are being a saint by putting up with it.", "the way he allows her to treat you IS him choosing. he is choosing to ignore the way his mother treats you. his peace means more to him than your feelings and comfort.", "> Honestly both me and my SIL tried and all we got back was a serious clap back resulting in my SIL to be visited by CPS because she falsely accused her and her husband of being alcoholics and that their 2 year old son was being abused. The woman is absolutely nuts.\n\nAnd this is why your husband (and the BIL) needs to step up and make a choice.

I know divorce gets thrown around a lot on this sub, but I wasn't suggesting you should! (Or at least I didn't mean to!) However, he needs to be the one to fix this. You can't do it on your own!\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. Your MIL, is insane.", "NTA no contact for mil. Install cameras. A ring door bell records sound. Password protect your daughter and your stuff from doctors appointments to day care. Document everything. Keep all text. Honestly this will help with a restraining order later. And I feel you may need one.", "NTA And thank god the cops came quick before the party started. I would go no contact and get  a restraining order when she goes bonkers, because you know she will.", "He needs to choose. At this point it is impacting your daughter too. She falsely called CPS on your BIL and these guys aren't holding her accountable? It doesn't matter that she raised them. Their kids need to come first."]}
