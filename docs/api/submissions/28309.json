Our parents were best friends and we have been through high and hell together. I will call her Julie (27F). I realized I had fallen in love with her when I was only in middle school and we started dating my freshmen year of high-school. When she broke up with me I was devastated  but we continued to be friends. In my senior year of high school I met my now fianc\u00e9 Autumn (22F) which I fell hard for. I remember during my prom when I posted pictures on Facebook of me and Autumn at prom she called me crying and asked me for a second chance and I felt so guilty and for a moment thought about taking her back but just seeing Autumn made me realize she is where my future is. Going into my early 20s I would still see her at family gatherings and she\u2019d invite me to hangout with her and our old friend group but it didn\u2019t feel the same anymore. I was/ still am in love with Autumn and every time me and Julie hung out she would always try to cross boundaries with me, it got to the point where I told her that I couldn\u2019t be around her anymore because it felt disrespectful to my girlfriend knowing she still had feelings for me. \n\nFast forward 4 years later and she has passed away. This caused a dark cloud over my family because my sisters, mom and I are very close with her family. When she was sick she wanted me to visit her and I did. She confessed that even though we haven\u2019t spoken in years she\u2019s still very much in love with me. I felt really bad for her but I didn\u2019t know how to respond and I just sat in silence. I feel almost guilty for not being able to love her back. My fianc\u00e9 Autumn had also come to the hospital with me and decided to wait in the lobby but was met with dirty looks from Julie\u2019s sisters. Me and Autumn were basically being treated like insensitive AHs. As always I am unfazed but Autumn cried to me the other night after I told her Julie had passed away. She told me if we have to postpone the wedding we can but I refuse. I told her I spent a fortune on our wedding and she always comes first no matter what. \n\nMy mom, sisters and Julie\u2019s family think I am being a terrible person considering I won\u2019t be able to make it to Julie\u2019s funeral with it being days before my wedding. I have mixed feelings now so AITA?\n\nTo add some clarity, we are leaving town a week before our actual wedding date and already booked an AirBnB", "created_utc": 1696542750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170uk0b/aita_for_blowing_off_my_childhood_best_friend/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm assuming your wedding has been booked for awhile and changing it would mean a lot of re arranging. Maybe I'm cynical, but I'm finding it hard to believe that days before your wedding is the only day that was suitable for Julie's funeral. Visiting her before she died was more important than showing up after. Enjoy your wedding day, and don't let it be over shadowed by other people's negativity.", "Edited with additional information from OP: NTA.\n\nIt's understandable you have mixed feelings about it but since this is a destination wedding, it would be unreasonable to uproot everything and add on a considerable amount of additional costs. Furthermore, as long as you're feeling comfortable with it, then you're fine. Besides, not everyone goes to funerals for all sorts of reasons. It may cause some hurt feelings, but everyone has to deal with such feelings.\n\nWe still mourn those we've lost, even if there was no funeral service for them. \n\n~~INFO~~\n\n~~Okay, you've established the funeral is days before your wedding - how many days before?~~\n\n~~Is the wedding and funeral in places that are far apart?~~", "NTA.\n\nYour response to your future wife is laudable. She should never have to wonder where your priorities lie.\n\nEven if you weren\u2019t getting married out of town, do you feel the need to attend the funeral of someone at hat repeatedly tried to cross your boundaries?\n\nYes, she was your ex and perhaps best childhood friend but it appears that her actions created some distance between you two, even before she died. Why would her death change that? \n\nIf you feel like going to the funeral, make it happen. If not, nobody\u2019s opinion should sway you or make you feel guilt. Julie is gone, whether you are there or not for the funeral, she is still not coming back. If you being there changed things, it would be a different story.", "NAH\n\nDo you feel like going? or, are you being pressured by your family? \n\nI think you did a lot by going to see her at the hospital and given how her family treated your fianc\u00e9, I would not blame you if you decided not to go. But, if deep inside, if you feel like you would like to be there, then I suggest you try to find even a few minutes to show up and pay condolences. \n\nIf your wedding is in a different city, and you can't physically be there. You can still have a gesture with her family, at least give her parents a call?", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you were close friends were Julie anymore, so I don't see why you'd postpone a wedding for her. And especially after the treatment you say you got from Julie's family, I wouldn't even feel comfortable going to her funeral.", "NTA - It\u2019s okay to still be in love with your ex. It\u2019s not okay to repeatedly cross boundaries with your ex to the point where they don\u2019t feel comfortable being around you any more.\n\nWhether you go or whether you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not the AH.", "NAH\n\nPeople are grieving. I can see the response as being unreasonable, but also this is a moment where unreasonable behavior has a bit of grace - not excused maybe but I personally feel more of an ability to give people grace in these moments. \n\n\nHow does Autumn feel? Is this all in the same general vicinity? And is there something you actually need to do wedding related the same day that coincides with the timing of this event? If you don\u2019t want to go, at the end of the day, none of the answers to these questions really matter, but if a part of you does, they are things to consider. \n\n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s up to you. It could be a nice gesture to send flowers and/or some kind of card. You are not wrong for moving on and prioritizing your committed relationship. It doesn\u2019t erase the closeness your family has with this family and a lot of people are hurting. Kind words can go a long way in lieu of being physically present, just something to consider.", "INFO/NTA - what kind of wedding prepping is mandatory? Unless it\u2019s rehearsal, I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t do both. \n\nIt\u2019s weird this is so controversial with so many people. It seems some info is being left out.", "NTA.  Considering the friendship ended long ago, and the things done to croos boundaries, repeatedly, you being there may just cause more problems, especially for Autumn.

It's a tough spot you are in because you knew each other for so long that your families are pretty much linked. It's completely your decision, but if I were you, I would go to the funeral. If it's before your wedding I do t see why it would be an issue", "This is dicey. I generally think funerals trump most other events. But your relationship with her complicates things. NAH, though you will be perceived as such by Julie's family, so that's the tradeoff here if you're willing to live with it.", "INFO how many days before the wedding? You can't spare a couple hours? \n\nI dont think youre an AH either way but you should go for you if you want", "NTA but you might regret not attending funeral and getting some closure and comforting your family. How many days is the funeral before the wedding? Is it a big wedding, I assume the rest of your family will be able to manage both.\n\nPersonally I'd want to postpone the wedding if there would be a lot of overlap between friends and family at both.", "NTA - It would be wonderful if you could make it to Julie's funeral but you already have wedding plans in place. It would be a different story if Julie didn't try to cross boundaries and you two had remained close friends this whole time but that wasn't the case. Her death is tragic and I know you are mourning her, but if you feel confident that you will be able to enjoy yourself at the wedding and not have a dark cloud over you, prioritize that. The funeral isn't for the dead, it is for the living and the living people don't know the whole story (nor is it time for you to tell it, as that could harm their memory of her) so you will just have to make peace with their frustration.   \n\n\nThat being said, don't let money and cancelation fees ruin your chance to go to the funeral if you want to. If you do want to be there, you should go. Saying goodbye to your friend and old love will not be  a front against Autumn, and I'm sure she will understand that.", "YWNBTA I admire your forethought for Autumn as it's a difficult situation, but I don't understand how you can't spare a few hours to say goodbye to your past by attending Julie's Funeral and then focusing on your new life with Autumn who is your present and future.\n\nIn the end it's your decision and you should do what's right for you. Ignore what others think as grief does weird things to people.", "NTA because they were being rude to him and his fianc\u00e9 when they went to visit. They are going to be treated just as bad at the funeral and possibly blamed for Julie not having her chance at love before death.", "[deleted]", "YWBTA if you don't go.  Preparations for the wedding not the wedding interfere?  Get Autumn to do the prep.", "YTA Why can't you do both events? The funeral is DAYS before, you cannot possibly be that busy with the centrepieces. Unless there is some very concrete reason then you should try to go to the funeral. Not just for the whole AITAH thing, but to stop you regretting it later. This is exactly the type of thing that leads to lingering regrets, don't do that to yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
