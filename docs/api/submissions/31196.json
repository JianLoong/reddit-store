{"id": 31196, "submission_id": "17xwvsh", "title": "AITA for walking out on my sister/Dad's holiday events", "selftext": "I (28 F) live with my sister (26) around two hours from my parents. I love them but my mother (50 F) is very smug and overbearing.  All my life, she mocked me, forbade me from wearing dresses because I was a chubby child and would not allow me to wear tank tops or singlets. If I wear something she doesn't like or say something she thinks isn't exactly what I should say, she'll look me up and down or demand I be quiet. If I don't feel like going somewhere with her, she'll cry, sulk and make my life hell until I give in. Shes always tried to control me, so I do my best to only visit her when I have to.\n\nMy sister and Dad's birthdays are coming up so the family has gone on a holiday, which I have been dreading. We have just reached the hotel and she's been looking at me up and down, especially my legs. I lost a lot of weight last year, but have gained a bit due to a few struggles with mental health, which she loves to point out. My sister suggested going bowling and my Mum immediately went on a tirade about me getting changed and went through my bags to find something she deemed appropriate. For context, I'm wearing a long black jacket and a dress with cats on it. She asked me why I insisted on wearing things she didn't like, so, frustrated, I left the hotel room and went downstairs to have a bit of time to myself. I was so furious because it took me back to being a child when she would bar me from leaving my house if my knees were visible because I had \"elephant knees.\" My therapist has been telling me to make more boundaries and stand up for myself when my mother bullies me, so I guess I finally snapped. My family has been calling me ever since, my sister telling me that I ruined her birthday and my mum won't let them go out and do anything unless I come back. I don't want to ruin anything, but I don't feel like I should have to deal with this behaviour at my age. I feel terrible, but I don't want to be manipulated into giving in to her. This happens often and my sister, who is Mum's baby and often just takes her side, said nothing. My dad is the only one who demanded she leave me alone. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Family have called me from doing family activities and my mother has told me my sister is upset and I need to consider her. She told me I had no consideration for her wearing a dress when I needed to wear pants and she hopes I'm happy because the holiday is ruined. I've contacted my partner and he doesn't understand  why she's behaving like this, as I brought this dress for his grandparents' formal dinner six months ago.", "created_utc": 1700276674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xwvsh/aita_for_walking_out_on_my_sisterdads_holiday/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What everyone is telling you about cutting ties etc DOES NOT take into consideration living with the emotional abuse you are still trying to overcome.

Please don't give up. But no, you NTA.
