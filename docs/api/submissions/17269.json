Next to me on the plane it was a mom with her around 1 year old baby. The baby was upset and crying almost the entire time, the mom was also in panic mode and would take the baby to the bathroom multiple times to calm him down. She kept apologising for the disturbance to both passengers and the crew and I felt bad for her. She seemed extremely young and overwhelmed.\n\nA lady that was sitting on the seats in front of us kind of scolded the mom of the baby and told her word for word \"instead of being a crybaby like your kid, be better prepared next time since none of us are in a mood to hear screeching noises for almost 4 hours. That or leave your baby at home.\"\n\nThe mom kept apologising and said she couldn't leave her baby at home since she doesn't have anyone to care for her baby. The lady then said \" Then don't travel it's not a necessity, you chose to travel\". The mom tried to justify herself saying how it is a necessity for her to travel in this case and it's for a family matter. The lady kept going and told the mom \"then find other ways to travel then. Get a car and travel or go on a train or bus\". I had enough of this and I stood up for the mom. I asked the lady if she knows how much time it takes to travel from London to Athens in any other way? And that a train or a bus is as much of a public transport as the plane is? I told her to be compassionate. She told me \"I don't have to be compassionate I paid for my fuckin seat and I want some peace and quiet\" I told her to suck it up she's in a public transport. If she wants peace and quiet she should either book first class or a private jet next time. She shut up for the next of the flight but made sure to pass by the mom and the baby and give disapproving side eyes multiple times.\n\nI was describing this story to my friend and she told me I was out of line talking like that to that lady and I should have minded my business. \"not your circus not your monkeys\" is what she said and said I purposely made myself an AH in this situation.", "created_utc": 1684138800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i1yiy/aita_for_telling_a_lady_on_the_plane_to_suck_it/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Standing up for another human being (especially an overwhelmed Mom) is a very good thing to do. And not having to listen to the mean lady for a couple of hours is totally worth it, too.", "NTA. Someone who is clearly struggling and looks overwhelmed is rarely able to stand up for themselves in an unexpected attack like that. \nThat young mum sounds like she was hanging on by a thread and I bet having someone else advocate for her made a big difference to how she felt on that flight and afterwards as well. \nYou were compassionate. Too many people look away when someone else is being abused. Good for you for standing up to an obnoxious person who was not helping an already difficult situation.", "NTA - You defended a very clearly upset mother. You were correct that it is public transport and if she wanted quiet she should book something else.\n\nYou defending that mother won't be forgotten by her any time soon, she will be very appreciative of it for a long time.", "NTA.\n\nFuck that lady.", "NTA. i feel like you would be the AH if you didn\u2019t stand up for her and chose to be a bystander. children cry, it\u2019s annoying, but that woman chose to berate a young mother that\u2019s obviously embarrassed and trying her best. like jfc just buy noise cancelling headphones", "NTA. That lady was being awful to what is a new mom by the sounds of it, and you placed it best, it's public transportation. There will be noise and such, and that the lady should have either rode first class or private if she wanted peace and quiet. You did the right thing standing up for the mom, and drop the friend if she thinks you should have minded your own business because she is likely going to end up like that entitled woman.", "NTA. Fuck that lady fr. Buy headphones like the rest of us and suck it up", "NTA being trapped in a tin can with a screeching child SUCKS but the mom was *trying* to soothe the kid. I'm assuming the kids ears hurt the whole flight because crying for 3 hours straight ain't normal.\n\nPissed off passenger was achieving nothing other than making an already ahitty situation worse.", "NTA. You stood up for someone being bullied, how could you possibly be an AH?", "NTA. You did good. I\u2019m a frequent flyer so I\u2019m used to loud kids, i typically just pack my noise canceling headphones. I get the old lady is pissed but if she has been flying often, she should\u2019ve packed ear plugs", "NTA. \n\nAs a mom, thank you.", "NTA - you provided great public service .. the mother was probably already embarrassed and upset", "NTA, and I'm curious about your \"friend\" if that's the side of the situation they want to pledge allegiance to...", "That mom was prob embarrassed and freaking out and you had compassion and stood up for her. NTA, it wasn\u2019t your circus or your monkeys but you helped someone who needed it.", "NTA\n\nBeing a new mum is hard, especially in a closed space like a plane. There isn't much to keep a baby or child busy and the best thing for them to do is a sleep. The mum probably appreciated what you said an did. \nThe lady is an AH. Babies can be loud and sometimes irritable, but that is the only from of communication they have", "NTA. The baby and it\u2019s mother weren\u2019t intentionally causing distress. The rude woman was.", "NTA. You were a goddamn hero.", "NTA.  Good for you for speaking up, especially as a bystander.  Not everyone has the bravery to do that.  I hate dealing with a crying baby as much as anyone, but that is part of the social compact we have.  Everyone is born a baby, and babies cry, sometimes for unpredictable reasons.  Babies are the future innovators and taxpayers in our society, and it is unreasonable to expect people to never travel because their babies might cry.  We pay for air transportation when we buy a plane ticket.  We aren't really paying for total silence.", "NTA. I'm an adult who is super upset by that kind of noise. \n\nBut bc i'm an adult, this is a problem solved with ear plugs and dramamine.", "NTA Good for you. That Mom needed someone like you and the other woman needed both a muzzle and to be put in her place.", "NTA If you want a quiet flight, use earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones. You can't expect that everybody is quiet. \nSure it isn't great to have a baby crying close, but stressing the mother helps no. It just make it worse cause the child feels the stress and the loud complaing also makes the baby just cry more.\n\nWhat did the woman expect? Put the child in a package and send it as express mail?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTH... the hero!!!!", "NTA. i bet it was more unnerving hearing that woman than that upset child.", "What a horrible woman, London to Athens is such a short flight, imagine thinking it was worth your time to be awful to another person and make them feel small because tHe PLaNe wAs NOisY for around 3 hours, like that would even help things.", "NAH.  That is tough.  It is literally a no-win situation.  Baby fussing is not just an annoying noise.  The human brain is hard-wired to stress response when a baby fusses.  Normal annoying noise?  Level 1 stress inducer.  Fussy baby?  Level 33 stress inducer.  \n\nUnder no circumstances should other people be subjected to your fussy baby longer than it takes you to relocate the fussy baby.  But what do you do when you're in an airplane?\n\nIt is rude in the extreme to travel by air with a fussy baby.  But then again, you can't exactly prohibit it.  \n\nSo if you jump into the debate on either side, you will be wrong.  And right.", "NTA, but I feel like I'm taking crazy pills - babies don't belong on airplanes (as opposed to trains or buses or cruise ships) because they're too young to perform the Valsalva maneuver and equalize the painful pressure difference in their inner ear.\n\nWhich means if you're a parent bring your infant on a plane, you're torturing them, full-stop. *That's* what we should be upset about - that a parent with an infant on the plane is abusing their child - not the regular-ass baby noise or whatever.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
