The mom tried to justify herself saying how it is a necessity for her to travel in this case and it's for a family matter. The lady kept going and told the mom \"then find other ways to travel then. Get a car and travel or go on a train or bus\". I had enough of this and I stood up for the mom. I asked the lady if she knows how much time it takes to travel from London to Athens in any other way?

Nice one for standing up for someone, please do it again in the future.", "NTA at all!! That lady was extremely out of line with what she was saying! I definitely understand being annoyed by hearing a crying baby for that long, but I also know how difficult it is to parent and get from point A to point B with a baby.

Thank you for standing up for another human being.", "NTA - mom was trying and frazzled so I'm sure she really appreciated having someone in her corner. When parents are trying it's very different than a parent just giving up and not parenting their kid.\n\nI also love your point about how much longer it takes to drive or anything else.

But they are public.", "NTA if she was going on about it then you were right to step in. You can\u2019t turn the baby off so her comments were just to make the mom feel like shit.

I find crying babies on planes extremely annoying.  That\u2019s on me, because the world has children in it.  Flying is pretty uncomfortable for babies, so it\u2019s not Mom\u2019s fault that she can\u2019t calm the baby most of the time (some don\u2019t even try so yeah).  So, I invested in noise canceling headphones and now everyone is happy.", "NTA. It absolutely sucks to be on a plane with a crying baby. You know who it usually sucks most for? THE PARENT. I can tell by your description that this mom was one of the stressed out variety. You can prep everything in the world. You cannot control how a baby will react to the flight. I have been lucky because my kids have traveled like pros since birth. I still plan for weeks in advance. I have every snack, medication, new toys in wrapping paper, multiple head sets, electronics with new media, coloring books\u2026 you name it. None of it would calm a little one that just won\u2019t be calmed. This mom likely did the same thing. Good on you for speaking up for her. Who on earth thinks you are going to get peace and quiet on a plane?", "NTA\n\nBeing stuck on a plane with a crying child is the absolute worst, and I completely get that. But you\u2019re 100% correct - it is public transport. The quality of your flight really is the luck of the draw. Not only is being combative completely unwarranted, but it doesn\u2019t in any way help the situation - the mother\u2019s already trying her best. What the fuck else is she supposed to do? Also, she doesn\u2019t know this woman\u2019s story. Maybe one or her parents is in the hospital and probably close to death? Now not only does she have the emotional toll of that to contend with, and not only is her child making things difficult, but now she has this argumentative woman on her case. \n\nHaving another random stranger step in and use that woman\u2019s own argument against her probably made life infinitely easier for that poor mother.\n\nYour friend who thought it\u2019s not your business, she\u2019d better hope to God someone doesn\u2019t think the same way as her if she\u2019s in that situation.", "NTA\nNicely done, that woman was out of line and she deserved telling. The baby's mother was having a far worse journey than anyone else.", "NTA. That was very kind of you to stand up for mom. A lot of people would have just kept to themselves. Babies are everywhere in the world. They cry. Parents have to travel and at times must bring their babies. It is what it is. People who shame parents for having crying babies on planes need to be more empathetic especially if the parents are doing everything they can to stop the crying. Do they think the parents are enjoying the sound of the crying baby and doing it on purpose? Absolutely not.", "NTA.
