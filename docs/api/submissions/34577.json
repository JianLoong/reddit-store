That's where I met my now \"Bestfriend\" (M16) who I'll call K. \nIt took a while but after I met K I became happy because I finally felt like I had friend.

I wouldn\u2019t want somebody who bullied me at my party either. However, your sister definitely is the A H and K is too (if he knew that your sis was a bully and still got with her). It seems like it\u2019s time to cut your sis and K off since he seems to value S\\*X over friendship", "NTA your sister is a brat and your parents are enabling her I would make sure nit pay her or K any attention anymore", "NTA but your parents really are. They are failing both you and your sister. There's something very wrong with your entire family and for whatever reason, your parents either don't care or are incapable of being good parents. The fact that your sister attacks your sexuality (or perceived sexuality) any your mother lets her get away with it is downright horrible. \n\nYour sister is a bully, because your parents raised her to be that way. Do you have any relatives you can contact for support? Your home is not a healthy place and you don't deserve to be treated this way. If you cannot get out of your home, find a supportive adult (like a teacher and/or counselor) that you can lean on for some support. Start focusing on school as much as possible so you can get grades good enough to earn scholarships. Start on an exit plan to get the f\\*ck out of your house and away from your family. Don't share anything important with any of them as they are not safe people. Focus on protecting yourself and working on your future. You deserve much better. There are many well functioning adults that are NC with their families.", "NTA but your parents are clearly not paying attention.", "definitely NTA for the time being you should just ignore K and ur sister. For whatever reason their being incredibly immature and petty.", "Geez just throw the whole family away.  Are you full sisters?  Something is off.  Why is your mother allowing your sister to bully you?  She called you \u201ca fucking bitch\u201d but your mom thinks you should apologize to her for saying the truth that you are glad that she wasn\u2019t at your birthday party.\n\nTell who me the golden child is without telling me.  K sounds like a d\\*ck.  The are both assholes and deserve each other.  Keep making friends and when they break up because assholes like them always break up keep her away from your friends.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019s a bully. Try your best to remain calm and give her no reaction when she\u2019s attempting to piss you off. This is how I deal with narcissists. If you don\u2019t react, she\u2019ll have no reason to continue. I\u2019m only saying this so you can protect your peace and mental health. I hope you make new friends & don\u2019t introduce them to your sister. I\u2019m not sure why your mom is only considering her feelings in this situation but you\u2019re not wrong at all. Maybe have a private conversation with your mother about how your sister treats you and see where it goes. \nOne more thing: K is not your friend.", "Something is very wrong with your mother to say you are the AH if she supports her golden child AKA your sister like this.\n\nYou are NTA because who wants their bully around when you want to have fun.", "NTA. Tell your sister K doesn't really like her, no one does, he;'s just using her for s\\*x.

Reality is best.", "Freezing her out will be just as effective, without building a malicious side into OP. \n\nAnd we don't know K at all. Who are we to say that's accurate?\n\nOP would be best pretending she isn't there until her tone changes.", "Expressing anger at a taunting bully isn't building a malicious side.

It was your birthday, wtf?", "I definitely told him but he thought because she stopped we should let her hang out with us because she was alone and had no friends. I do miss him but I'll stop attempting to be friends with someone who already showed me they don't want to be. Thank you.

Your sister is a unchecked bully.  She would hide your acceptance letter. \n\nStop trying to get your sister to love or like you. Tell your mom to fuck making amends. If she wanted you both to get along, she should have stopped your sister from bullying you years ago. She has made your home a unsafe place for you and she has failed her daughter by teaching her bullying is ok. Or show her this thread. \n\nStart working on your confidence and self esteem. Talk to a counselor, ask your mom to send you to therapy, read books. Your sister has been grinding you down for years while your mom just watched it happen! That makes you prime victim material for other abusers. Please know your sister\u2019s treatment of you is not your fault in any way. Your mom\u2019s neglect and apathy towards you, again is completely not your fault. Your mom is broken and she raised a broken bully of a daughter.
