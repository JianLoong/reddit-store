I guess she had forgotten that we still had a number of 24 year olds in the group.   \n\n\nThis has thrown my entire group into chaos.

Having a childfree wedding is fine, but a 18+ year old is not a child.  Having a limited or restricted guest list is fine, but inviting someone to a wedding & then retracting the invite because they're 24 is ridiculous.

NO one should go to this wedding, not even the fiance", "This is so weird that I wonder if there\u2019s someone under 25 that Kate doesn\u2019t want to invite but would feel obligated to do so, so instead she came up with this super bizarre rule.", "Nta, and tell her that throwing a tantrum at 25 shows she is still a child, and she shouldn't attend her own wedding. \n\nI accept childfree weddings, but you can't be pissed when people choose not to come because of it.", "NTA- Also drop her because she's right, the human brain doesn't stop developing until you're 25. So if you're older than 25 and still acting like a child, which she clearly is, then she should be dropped as a friend. She has a developed brain yet resorts to name calling and other childish behaviors. She's playing a stupid game, so therefore she wins a stupid prize.

It's considerably more nuanced, but nuance is not nearly as popular as bad reasoning. \n\nEditing to add: generally, instead of \"doesn't fully develop,\" people just go with \"doesn't develop,\" and that leads them to the weird conclusion that anyone under 26 is a child. No, Kate, you just lack any and all scientific literacy. \n\n(There are really interesting and nuanced discussions of this issue going on especially in European criminal courts, because these brain areas can be relevant to questions of criminal guilt.
