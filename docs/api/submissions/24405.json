But I don't expect to have sit around eating my fish and chips next to someone's barely caged underparts. \n\nNot wanting to stare at your penis does not make anyone a homophobe. Steve and Rob seem to be suggesting that walking around with your bits and bobs out is an exclusively homosexual activity. I think I'd be asking them to review that statement. I wouldn't want to see Steve's little friend out on the beach any more than I'd want to see my Great-Uncle Gerald's. Where they put their personal belongings when they're not at the beach really doesn't figure into the equation.", "In little mesh fishing nets. How nautical!", "I think you mean \u201choly balls\u201d?", "Add a cute little hat and you could even call it jaunty!", "Dudes a ped", "Nta\n\nFds cover your shit dude, there are levels of decency that need to be kept around kids. \n\nThis has nothing to do with sexuality and everything to do with being a weird, creepy mf in front of kids.", "NTA. Also what the fuck Steve?", "Since when is not wanting someone's junk on display in front of children homophobic? As far as I'm aware, straight and gay junk is the same.", "SHEER MEN SPEEDOS!!!! SEARCH IT UP AND REALIZE THAT STEVE IS A PERVERT", "Are you saying you're okay with kids being able to see older men's private parts clearly? Wow I can see this world is shaping out to fall into disaster", "NTA if the culture of your country sexualises naked bodies. I'm absolutely pro \"bodies are bodies and we should teach that to everyone from birth\", but I'm not an idiot, that only truly works at a systemic level, and if your kids didn't grow up in a country with this non-sexual attitude around bodies, then \\[EDIT: Steve\\] absolutely needs to wear fully opaque swimwear.", "NTA inappropriately dressed is inappropriately dressed and showing your privates to children or having it on display around children is concerning and is never okay", "Excellent.", "\"Tackle,\" I'm going to have to use this", "Thanks for the link. Nope not okay to wear in front of children no matter what your sexual orientation. He disrespectful and crossed the line."]}
