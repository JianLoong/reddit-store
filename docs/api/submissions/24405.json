Brother in law is in his early 30s  call him Rob and his partner who is 42 call him Steve.  \nWhen we go to into the water, Steve is wearing this mesh speedo, that looks more like male lingerie than swim wear. I pull him to the side and I am like Steve do you have something more family friendly. He is like what\u2019s wrong with this? I am like Steve can you just run to Target or one of the shops on the board walk, I\u2019ll Venmo you however much it costs to get a new swim trunk. Steve then gets Rob and then says I am being a diva.   \nI am like guys please I got little kids. Rob looks over to Steve in a way that is like come on Steve but then Rob starts yelling at me. And Rob is like, in Europe it\u2019s perfectly normal to go to nude beaches, and he says that it\u2019s good for kids to open their eyes and not live in a homophobic bubble. I am like no not at all, I don\u2019t want my daughters seeing this either, and it\u2019s not appropriate this is a beach with families and young kids. My wife comes over and tries to talk to Rob but nothing happens.  \nI end up getting the rest of my family and brother\u2019s and I say we are going to a new beach. Rob starts saying don\u2019t do this we are all family, it\u2019s really not a big deal we are gonna be in the water in most of the time. I don\u2019t say anything and just get into the car.   \nThis incident has really messed up the family. Steve especially hates me.

I can't find a single one that is see-through or overly accentuates the junk. Most of them are exactly what many competitive swimmers wear for training and not even as tight or as short as the bikini brief type of speedo. The mesh is just on the sides and there is a solid layer on the front and back that definitely hides all the naughty bits. I think OP might just be extremely uptight.

Are those a problem?", "YTA we don\u2019t get to police what others wear. \n\nMaybe is was skimpy for your liking, but it doesn\u2019t sound like he was flashing anyone. \n\nReverse this and think about what people would say if you were telling a woman her bikini was too revealing.", "All of this is why we need a picture of the swimsuit or something close to judge. Right now everyone is imaging something different. And frankly until I see more evidence. Until then I believe it\u2019s far more likely OP is freaking out over nothing than the dude was hanging dong.", "You are right- I don\u2019t have any evidence, but I am going off of what a reasonable adult would do. OP, is not providing evidence, though. They just said it was see through. If they post a picture of what it looked like, and it is in fact, see through, then cool, I will gladly change my verdict.", "But they\u2019re sexualized in our culture just as much as the penis. That\u2019s why women can\u2019t go topless everywhere men go topless. Should they just be treated as plain old organs and nothing special? Sure. But so should penises and vaginas. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re actually using them for sex at the time lol", "That\u2019s stupid.

Enjoy the downvotes.", "No they are not the same.\n\nLiterally the only purpose of sex organs is procreation. Being sexualized is not the same thing as sex being the purpose.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying there is anything wrong with nudity. But to say boobs and penises are the same is false to say the least.", "When people like you say \u201cenjoy the downvotes\u201d does that mean you actually care about whether your comments get upvoted or downvoted? You must if you assume everyone else cares too.", "My thoughts exactly."]}
