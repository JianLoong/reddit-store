It's gross.\n\nAs for using the body wash vs hand soap, meh, the body wash was right there so more efficient for him.

Which is fine! But I don't think that your husband is an asshole for crossing a boundary that you don't seem to have defined very well. If he does it again, then he might be an asshole, but for now there's NAH. \n\nSide note: if your body wash foams, it should do just as good as hand soap for washing your hands after you go to the bathroom. Your hand soap might have something extra in it to kill germs, but if you're washing your hands properly then the part of the soap that makes suds should do fine to A) remove particles and B) kill most germs. You can look it up if you'd like, but iirc soap destroys the protective layer around germs and kills them off.", "I\u2019m just so pleased to hear that he washed his hands after using the bathroom!

No. You shouldn\u2019t have to tell a grown man how germs work \ud83d\ude12", "So why didn\u2019t he use the body wash in the sink?", "NTA. He should have used the sink like a normal thoughtful person. However the antibacterial soap isn't any better. It's not proven to work on hands as opposed to hard surfaces, and it can breed super germs that are resistant to antibacterials.", "Yeah NTA. It\u2019s a strange thing to do. In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s a small amount of dirt/germs/whatever, in a large amount of water but it is strange and unnecessary. I wouldn\u2019t have wasted the water to refill the bath but, if I\u2019m honest, I probably would have felt a bit ick in that water. \n\nAs a side note- antibacterial soap has no advantage over regular soap. Reason being, that soap makes your hands slick and loosens the dirt/germs from your hands so that when you rinse, it slips off into the stream of water. Antibacterials have to sit on your hands for any real benefit but in soap they can\u2019t stay on your hands because, well, soap. So, if you are honestly worried about bacteria on your hands, use an antibacterial gel first, then soap and water- the antibacterial will kill the majority of bacteria, which will be dead on your hands, then soap and water will wash it all off. Don\u2019t spend extra money on antibacterial soap because it\u2019s just a marketing ploy.", ">Ask him if he'd mind you peeing in his bath before he hops in.\n\nCareful he might be into that", "Thank you, came here to say this.

Like he cannot let you have this nice moment in the bath without invading it in this weird way.\n\nDoes he generally have a problem keeping his distance when you try to have a \"me-moment\"?", "Exactly! I would not appreciate that in the least, OP. NTA", "Agreed. Gyms are gross af and you\u2019re going to stew in it.", "And it's better for the environment.", "Unless her body wash is made of caviar or something, I can't fathom why any normal person would care if their boyfriend occasionally used it to wash his hands.", "Dude you shouldn't bathe in a lake, the soap and shampoo isn't good for the environment. I mean thought that was obvious but i guess nobody told you.", "Which is why you shower after swimming.\n\nI don\u2019t get in a pool or lake to have a long soak and wash my hair, though.  Do you?", "100% correct and additionally soap does not kill bacteria. Yes it can help wash some away as well as affect any that are high pH sensitive but it is not antibacterial", "it's really just the principle of it, plus it doesn't rlly matter bc either way if someone doesn't want you to do it then u just shouldn't, that's just obnoxious\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's weird to go out of ur way to use the tub over the sink anyhow", "At least it\u2019s *my* dirt and asshole!", "Sure but this is still way too sensitive. Like she was about to out her entire fucking dirty ass body in that water but his hands was just too much?!?", "Well that makes your reaction even worse. His hands were probably cleaner than your post-workout body.", "Dont clean your face with bathwater. That's gross", "Somebody better wash their hands before putting it up my butt.", "Something much grosser. Clam chowder. Cream of mushroom soup. Something that will float and discolor the water and smell gross.", "There is soap and shampoo you can buy that's safe for the environment. You can find it with camping supplies. But definitely don't use the regular stuff in a natural body of water.", "Yes?  *His* hands, not hers?", "Nah, the downvotes are for going against the hivemind and backing up your aruement with logic."]}
