This just a case where you need to ask him not to do that again because it bothers you.  And if he does it again, then it would be an asshole move on his part.  And if he doesn't, then everything is fine.  \n\nWhat matters is his respecting your wishes in the future.  It's okay that you have different feelings about this.

He should respect that. I would be more annoyed if he had like a mechanic's hand and got visible dirt in your tub though and THEN would have re-made the water.
