I was a lonely child and he was my emotional support, he was everyone's responsibility, everyone would look after him. However, my sister, Frankie (20sF) always claimed that Rookie was hers  and that she was his sole carer, although she barely did anything and only did stuff with him to put on social media.\r  \n\r  \nOne time she had an argument with our mother and she left with Rookie and was gone for weeks,she never messaged and I barely slept. Until one day I returned home and Rookie tackled me to the floor, and I sobbed into Rookie for hours. Frankie came home a few days later and acted as if nothing happened, since that day, I never let Rookie be alone with Frankie again and I became the owner not too long after, since Rookie wouldn't let anyone else walk feed or sleep around him.\r  \n\r  \nIn the recent years, my sweet Rookie passed away in the night from health issues. I was his person in his old years. Our dad buried him a couple of hours later and I decided to sort out his belongings. After his passing, Frankie made it all about her and how hard her life was without him. \r  \n\r  \nI was angry but left it, as we all loved him. Until one day my other sister, Joanne (30sF) sent me screenshots of Frankie messaging a friend about how sorry she felt for me as a kid and that she 'gave' me Rookie out of pity because I was 'such a loser' and that no matter what, Rookie would 'always be hers'. \r  \n\r  \nOnce I saw her again, she asked me where 'HER dog's grave was' and I told her that she didn't deserve to know, and I suppose out of grief I exploded at her for acting like such an entitled See You Next Tuesday, and that how dare she say those things about me and act like the owner when I was the one pouring water and mashed kibble into him so he'd eat and drink, when I was the one giving him  bathes to soothe his arthritis, when I was the one cradling him in his last hours so he wasn't alone. When I was the one loving on him despite his old dog smell, and that if she loved him so much, she would have come and visited him in his golden age. When \\*I\\* was the constant as she dipped in and out of Rookie's life for years. \r  \n\r  \nShe proceeded to scream that I was a 'selfish See You Next Tuesday' and that I was horrible for denying her the chance to say goodbye. \r  \n\r  \nShe eventually got the location of Rookie's grave off of one of my parents and she said goodbye to him when I was away at college, but we've had a visible wedge between us since. I have since hidden the remainder of Rookie's belongings (which I kept) and I reckon she may have tried to find since I went into my bedroom once to find a few drawers and belongings scattered. \r  \n\r  \nMy friends and Joanne are 100% on my side  and says that Frankie has always been a selfish woman, meanwhile my parents have said that I went a bit too far since he was a \\*family\\* pet and now I'm feeling a bit guilty, if not, a little morbid.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n So, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697143001, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176grwr/aita_for_not_telling_my_sister_where_our_dog_was/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just lost the last of my big boys (100+lb boxer-pittbull). You did what you did because you were hurt. Your sister was also hurt too. You went overboard. As you said, he was a family that, which means your sister also had the right to say her goodbyes.\n\nOn another note, your sister sounds like she is toxic to be around. It is okay to remove toxic people from your life and not feel bad about doing it. I removed my toxic sister from my life back in 2016 and I have no regrets of doing so. Everyone knows that it was you who helped your furbaby cross the Rainbow Bridge especially him.

Even if your sister only used Rookie as a social media prop according to you, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not allowed to mourn his passing. Also, you don\u2019t know her true thoughts or feelings regarding the situation and we\u2019re only getting your perspective. The truth could be a lot more nuanced especially with how strong her reaction was IMO.", "NTA. She didnt care until she wanted attention...", "NTA. It could have been handled better by both sides, but she is acting like a spoiled 14 year old girl.\n\nThere was no reason for her to badmouth you to begin with. You loved Rookie, and he is a part of your heart now. You always had a special bond with him, and you cared for him when he was elderly until the day he went to the big dog park. She couldn't even make time to see him.\n\nAlso your parents have clearly spoiled her. Rookie may have started as a family dog, but when he had arthritis and needed special care, you stepped up and did that. So you're not in the wrong here, in my opinion. However, next time, approach things like this calmly. That way if it blows up, you know you did your best and you're the calm one while the other person isn't.", "This all sounds like some weird \"my grief is better than your grief\" pissing contest.\n\nESH.", "ESH.  She's a jerk for taking the family dog away from its family for that long and you're a jerk for denying her his belongings and grave.  You're BOTH making it about you and BOTH caddy as hell.  What other dumb shit do you fight over?  What other crap do you onenup each other on?  The more you told that story, the more horrible you became.  Get over yourself.", "ESH both of you sound petty. Grow up and act like adults. It was a family dog and you cannot gatekeep a family pets grave or belongings. I grew up with multiple family pets and some were definitely more of a favourite by one or another but they were still everyone\u2019s pet. I think both of you have acted childish, you say Rookie was taken by your sister for several weeks and that after that you wouldn\u2019t let Frankie be alone with him and that she acted like nothing happened. Maybe because nothing did happen, you don\u2019t mention anything in regards to him possibly being mistreated or not being fed or not being walked by her. I\u2019m just failing to understand your reasoning behind your behaviour", "YTA because you're way over the top. Rookie wasn't only your dog. \"Sobbing into Rookie for hours\" is a lot.

I must have missed something...", "Haha! okay this made me laugh after a tough day. I may or may not have put Rookie on a pedestal for his whole life. I suppose I wanted her to feel how I felt when she took him to live god knows where for weeks on end. Looking back after a while, it wasn't the best move.", "You're not wrong. In case it seemed like it in the post, I never kept Rookie from her, I just never left Rookie alone with her. If she wanted to see him, I'd walk him into town and meet with her, but she still spun the narrative that I was being petty by always being there.", "I totally understand. This post is evidently one-sided and my sister, to my knowledge, doesn't have reddit. I would have given more context for Frankie's behaviour but was aware of the character limit. It was really more a case of everyone else, eventually me, doing all of the work for Rookie and then Frankie taking all of the credit whilst constantly  insulting me. That combined with Rookie's death days prior, it wasn't a proud moment for me. I'm more than happy to answer more questions in the comments for more insight.", "I usually do approach things calmly hence everyone's shock when I did explode, but I will keep this in mind, thank you.", "The context about the belongings is that all of Rookie's stuff is stuff that I had bought with my own money and therefore they were mine to keep after his passing. Frankie (I didn't mention this in the post) has a habit of resorting to thievery when she's denied something. She has stolen from me my entire life haha! I was only keeping my things safe.", "I actually covered this topic in a different comment below and would of loved to have given more context on the post but had no room, so I'm just going to repeat it here...Rookie was returned weeks later thin as a twig and was dehydrated, and before that and afterwards, Frankie refused to walk, feed or bathe Rookie because all that stuff was 'boring' and she wanted to go out and party. Frankie also had other pets after she left home that disappeared one day and she never said what happened to them but there was some digging and it was pure neglect/she got bored of them. She also stayed in a place where there were other dogs and Rookie was scared of other dogs so I chose to supervise Rookie around Frankie indefinitely. Hopefully this brings more insight. In case you're wondering, \\*yes\\*, we did try and locate the both of them but she had also recently smashed her cell phone so it was difficult to find them.", "Actually that is a normal reaction of people who actually love animals - not just pictures of them.\n\nHer sister sounds like a proper AH. And she is probably worse than described. People like that use others to get pity. She probably searched for the dogs things so people would feel bad for her. Loss of a pet is something you feel, not something to post on social media", "Sorry...I was only typing what I remembered when he came home after not knowing if he was even alive by that point \ud83e\udd37I wanted to include this info in my post but unfortunately it was too much- Frankie was/is terrible with animals. She had pet dragons and cats but she suddenly didn't have them anymore and never told us what happened to them, that's why I was hysterical when he came back. He was also thin as a twig and starving when he was returned. I really should have tried to fit a condensed version into the post.", "Did you miss the part where the dog was gone for weeks without a word from her asshole sister who took him without telling anyone and she had no idea of the dog was even alive? Because that warrants sobbing and hugging your dog for as long as you need to when you see him again and are so relieved he's alive.\n\nUnless you're a cold hearted prick", "I laughed at \u201csorting his belongings\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Would if you were in that situation.

You should do it more. Holding things in, and letting them build the resentment inside you - makes you blow up. In the future, communication is the key. When something happens that upsets you, talk it out then. It's healthier for you", "The word count stopped me from going into deep detail and Frankie is more colourful than my post let on. I let Frankie hold Rookie for some photographs days before his death, and seconds after they were taken, she threw him back at me demanding I take him back because 'he smelled of death', which may have also added to my outburst.", "There was quite a bit to sort.
