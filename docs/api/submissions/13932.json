This pregnancy has been nothing short of chaotic. My girlfriend has never experienced pregnancy and she\u2019s terrified to give birth, so any feeling of discomfort she freaks out. I understand that pregnancy is hard and scary, and my girlfriend doesn\u2019t have her family around to help her, so she\u2019s probably experiencing a lot of anxiety. I\u2019m not trying to downplay that. I\u2019m frustrated because I feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of the fact that she can get me to do things for her just because she\u2019s pregnant. \n\nWe got into a fight a few days ago. She insisted that she didn\u2019t feel good, and she thought something was wrong with the baby. She wanted to go to the hospital to make sure everything was okay. We\u2019ve been to the hospital for this kind of \u201cemergency\u201d almost four times since the beginning of her pregnancy. I had to go to work because we are severely understaffed, so I told her that if she still didn\u2019t feel good tonight we could go make sure everything was okay. She got upset with me, and she told me that I never take her pain serious. I told her that I can\u2019t drop everything any time she feels any discomfort. Pregnancy is uncomfortable. We argued some more then I left for work. When I got home I asked if she was feeling better, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me. She has stopped talking to me about her pregnancy now, and I feel like she is being manipulative. She\u2019s withholding information about my child because I didn\u2019t drop everything to take her to the hospital, again. I tried explaining to her my side of things and I apologized, but she\u2019s still mad at me. \n\nMy girlfriend is treating me like I\u2019m the asshole, but I feel like she isn\u2019t seeing how frustrated and tired I am from dropping everything for her.

If you don\u2019t care about your girlfriend\u2019s discomfort, try at least pretending to care about your first child.\n\nETA: and way to bury in the comments that it\u2019s a high risk pregnancy, that there HAVE been issues 2/3 of the time you\u2019ve gone to the hospital, and that they\u2019ve specifically told her to come in if anything is wrong. Yikes with a capital YIKES, OP.\n\nYTA", "YTA. She should leave you. \n\nShe is due to give birth NEXT MONTH. If something goes wrong it could go very wrong, very fast. \n\nYou might have left your co-workers shorthanded. She could have died of eclampsia or been in premature labor. You're not the same.", "YTA for real, jesus. You made it seem like you take her every other day. Four times in seven months is completely reasonable! She's scared and just wants to be sure the kid is ok! Good lord.\n\nEDIT, see now that you said ALMOST four times. Three whole hospital visits for a first-time mother is just too much. You're a wonder.", "Are you an obstetrician?  No?  Then YTA.\n\nShe's scared.  She thinks something is wrong, and you can't be certain that there isn't.   I can guarantee she doesn't want to go to the hospital because it is fun.\n\nAre you taking any childbirth classes or participating in any group activities for future parents?  If not, maybe you should be, though it's getting late in the game.   Meeting other women experiencing the same things would probably help with her anxiety.\n\nAs for her not talking to you, what do you expect?   You just showed her that when she is stressed and scared, you are dismissive and arrogant.   Why would she talk to you and add even more to her stress levels?", "YTA - There's a post on r/bestofredditorupdates about the aftermath of this exact same situation.\n\nSpoiler alert, dude missed the birth of his child and still doesn't get why she's mad.", "oh that\u2019s super cool that you\u2019ve been pregnant and understand that it\u2019s uncomfortable! oh wait. no. it\u2019s fucking weird as hell dude, and the single most dangerous event in a woman\u2019s life. you think you\u2019re tired and stressed by this??? you are 1% as tired, stressed, and inconvenienced as she is. yta\n\neta: OP has said that 2/3 times there was something wrong, and yet is talking as though she\u2019s a hypochondriac\n\nAND you told her your job is more important than her life or the life of your child. i wouldn\u2019t talk to you either, at least without major apologies.", "YTA \n\nSo 2 out of the 3 times she went to the hospital, there was an actual issue? \n\nLet me say that again 2 out of the 3 times she has gone to the hospital while pregnant she had actual issues that needed medical attention to help protect her and the baby. \n\nYou talk about discomfort but do you understand the responsibility one feels to make sure their unborn child is safe? We aren't able to check and watch them like once they're born so we can only go on clues and feelings our bodies give us. So of course there are times pregnant people feel anxious about the safety of their child, not to mention their own safety. I would never say it's unfounded but sometimes there isn't anything but sometimes there is.\n\n If she was in the hospital every week without any issues then I'd say she might need to talk to someone and get help with her anxiety but that's not what is happening here.\n\nETA \nShe's high risk and under the advice of the doctor to go when she feels like something is wrong? Do you even hear yourself?", "YTA\nSince you\u2019ve never been pregnant yourself, how could you ever begin to presume you know the difference between being uncomfortable, and being in pain that could be dangerous?\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely downplaying her feelings and not taking her seriously. If you care so much about the well-being of your child, why would you deny bringing her to the hospital when she says she is in pain?\n\nAlso, four emergency trips to the hospital during one pregnancy is not that many. I think you need to listen to your partner and empathize with her anxiety AND her pains, be there to support her, and don\u2019t pretend you know what she\u2019s going through when you literally have no idea.", "YTA.\n\nI'm pretty sure your girlfriend knows her own body better than you do. Pregnancy is hard at the best of times, to say nothing of it being her first time, and she's terrified. If she says she wants to go to the hospital, she's not doing it just for giggles, or because she thinks she can make you do whatever she wants. It's because she's genuinely frightened.\n\nWhat are you going to do when she says she thinks she might be in labor? Blow her off because she's being manipulative and overreacting?", "YTA. MASSIVELY SO. Conveniently, you omitted the fact that it\u2019s a HIGH RISK pregnancy, they TOLD her to go to the ER if she feels something is wrong and TWICE there were issues, like contractions and the baby NOT MOVING. \n\nYOU are not a doctor. YOU are not pregnant. Your opinion on what is \u2018reasonable\u2019 anxiety is completely irrelevant. The opinions of medical experts and the person carrying the child matter. Your job is to SUPPORT her - start doing that and stop dismissing her.\n\nWhy did you get this poor girl pregnant if you\u2019re not ready, willing able to step up as a partner and parent?!", "YTA. During my friends pregnancy she had discomfort enough to visit the hospital 5 times prior to birth. One of those times she had a kidney infection and needed a 2 day hospital stay. Her partner didn't believe her and I took her instead. Pregnancy is unpredictable and stress makes a big impact. \n\nPlease just take her to the hospital, encourage her to seek mental health care and suggest she join some mommy support groups. If you are her only support and she's scared of course she's going to rely heavily on you.", "YTA - Your wife is pregnant and you're minimizing her symptoms as \"discomfort\". \n\n>I told her that I can\u2019t drop everything any time she feels any discomfort.\n\nBuddy, you should have thought of this before you got her pregnant. You're locked in this rollercoaster now, and you're just getting started. If she doesn't have family around, then you're it. You should let your work know she's pregnant and you're going to have a lot of sudden absences coming up.", "YTA - You have girlfriend who has been told by her OBGYN's that she's high risk and go to the hospital if she feels something is wrong.\n\nHigh risk means she needs to take more care of herself.  Get ready to care for a child by caring for your child's mother.\n\nAt least twice something has been medically wrong.\n\nShe's not going to the hospital for shits and giggles.  Wait til you have a kid who gets sick often.", "YTA. \n\nYou state in the 3 times she's gone, two of those times there has been something wrong. Edit: and she has a high risk pregnancy!?? What the f is wrong with you!?! You're mansplaining her feelings and what she is physically going through since you clearly know everything about a woman during pregnancy. \n\nAnxiety is real and it's amplified ten fold during pregnancy. I was so in tune with every little feeling that anything out of the norm sent me on a \"what if\" spiral. I passed out myself and cracked my head on concrete - let me tell you - the hospital was not a fun time. Downright scary. So if she wants to go - her gut is telling her to go and she's listening. Trust her. \n\n...And be a better human to her please.", "YTA. Take her to the hospital, and also encourage her to seek mental health care and join support groups. If she is all alone and scared she needs more support than just you.\n\nIt is 100% better to be safe than sorry in these situations, and the hospital staff are 100% used to seeing people come in frequently during a pregnancy to make sure everything is okay.", "She is pregnant. That\u2019s her body growing a human. If something feels wrong to her, you aren\u2019t going to know. You haven\u2019t grown a human in your body, so it\u2019s pretty sexist to say that you know better than her what is going on in her body. \n\nGoing to the ER because something doesn\u2019t feel normal is NOT taking advantage of you. Trust me, nobody wants to spend hours sitting in a waiting room around sick people (particularly since covid) for fun. Not unless they have mental health issues like munchausens. \n\nFor the record, things can feel wrong (or go wrong) multiple times in a pregnancy. My mother ended up being admitted to a ward for weeks during her pregnancy with me, until I was delivered, because she kept having to go to hospital as things were going wrong. \n\nYou\u2019re also really, really not seeing the risks here. If something is wrong and you don\u2019t take her, the chances of her and the baby surviving are reduced the more time you wait. Time is crucial. And now you have made her feel unsafe sharing information about how she\u2019s feeling, by dismissing her symptoms and health. The baby AND her could be at risk. \n\nDon\u2019t be yet another man telling a woman that her body doesn\u2019t feel the way she says it feels and that it\u2019s in her head or she\u2019s exaggerating or she must be weak because it\u2019s normal. Women experience systemic minimising of their health issues and especially when it comes to their reproductive and sexual health. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Few people would go to the hospital for funsies these days. If she claims something feels off, it feels off. Rude. Shame you can\u2019t carry the next baby\u2026", "YTA. It's a difficult time for her and she needs to know she can rely on you. Instead, you brand her manipulative and prioritize your work. When she gives birth without you because you didn't take her seriously, and refuses to let you see the baby, you'll be back here asking again if you're TA.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't know her body, and if she says she needs to go to the hospital, you should take her seriously. Your job would understand that you have a pregnant gf who needs to go to the hospital.\n\nI understand it may feel like \"the boy who cried wolf\", but what happens when she's actually going into labour, or worse, experiencing complications that are life threatening and time-sensitive, and you just tell her to wait it out?\n\nThat could result in a horrible tragedy.", "Yta - it's \"your\" child when you want info, but also not your problem when she wants to go to the hospital. Can't have it both ways.", "YTA. I hope she leaves you. \nSigned, a pregnant lady", "YTA it doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s being paranoid, if your pregnant wife wants to go to the hospital, take her. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not doing it for fun.", "YTA. Boohoohoo, OP. *You're* \"frustrated and tired from dropping everything for **her\"?**", "You're not just an asshole, you're what comes out. I'm sure she's feeling awesome and super confident about having you as her partner. \n1. High risk pregnancy \n2. Right 2/3 times that something was in fact wrong\n3. Instructed to do exactly this by her ob\n\nI'm pregnant with my 2nd and let me tell you reading that you \"understand pregnancy is uncomfortable\" and you just \"wish she could find a ways to deal with her anxiety\" makes me was to keep you out of the delivery room for her. You have no idea, and instead of being kind, understanding, or empathetic, you've tried to paint her as some hypochondriac who's rushing to the hospital for every hiccup.", "YTA. \n\nMedical gaslighting at its finest. I love the fact that someone who is unable to physically take part in the act of growing a child in utero is somehow an expert to tell the pregnant woman what she is or is not feeling. \n\nWhy should she now tell you anything?  Anytime she told you before she is just a hysterical woman who doesn\u2019t know her own body.", "\u201cTaking advantage of the fact that she can get me to do things for her\u201d\n\nThat statement would relate to asking you to go get her ice cream or something, not take her to the hospital. \n\nYTA\n\nWhat is wrong with you?", "YTA.\n\nIf it just takes a hospital trip to give you gf peace of mind, just do it. I'm sure she doesn't want to just go to the hospital to have fun. She is scared and from the sound of this post she has no support. You seriously think she is taking advantage of her pregnancy for asking you to take her to the hospital? She's right, you don't take her seriously. You clearly have no regard for her pain and discomfort. \n\nThis is the one time you just need to shut up and be supportive and reassuring.", "Wow. YTA. I hope you show more compassion and trust for your child. JFC.", "High risk pregnancy and she's doing what the Drs told her to do and you think she's being dramatic \ud83d\ude44If my husband acted like this during my pregnancies I would have left him real fast.

Stop being so selfish you\u2019re not the most important one anymore your kid is.", "YTA... being pregnant and feeling sick and discomfort you have to go get checked out... anything can happen... during my pregnancy I stayed in the hosiptal and had got induce and had my baby early...\nYou will feel guilty if something bad happens or it is something more and you ignore her...\nPregnancy and health is very important...", "YTA nevermind the fact that she's not withholding information about your kid, gtfo here with that lmao", "yta\u2026 this is her first pregnancy and she is noticing something that doesn\u2019t feel right. You just disregarded and downplayed her. She doesn\u2019t feel like she can trust and rely on you anymore. People forget that pregnancy is dangerous and can kill you. Communication is important and allows you insight in what is going on with the mother. One of the ways to know something is wrong is through discomfort. Pain is an indication if something isn\u2019t right or a possible complication. By doing what you just did, you risk her not speaking up and potentially overlooking an issue that could be caught early.", "Yta - something similar to this happened with my aunt years ago. \n\nShe ended up having to wait to go to the hospital, only to find out that her baby had passed.

You've made it plenty clear that you don't want to be inconvenienced by it. You're facing the consequences of your actions and words.\n\nYes, it sucks, but instead of lashing out in frustration, and showing her you can't be relied on, perhaps look for more practical ways of helping her, like encouraging her to attend neo natal classes, find some counselling to help her with her anxiety, or even jsut talk about it to her gp or midwife, and see if there's some support for her.\n\nAs a dad to be, your job is to support her, to advocate for her, and to be her rock, and you failed her.

Also, if you think it\u2019s rough dropping everything now, just wait till you have a baby. Guess what dude?  You\u2019re going to have to drop a shit ton of stuff for that baby.

Lots of babies are early, and lots of complications are late. What if she came down with preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes, or ICP, or about another hundred conditions that get more likely as pregnancy progresses.

I understand that pregnancy is hard and scary, and my girlfriend doesn\u2019t have her family around to help her, so she\u2019s probably experiencing a lot of anxiety. I\u2019m not trying to downplay that. I\u2019m frustrated because I feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of the fact that she can get me to do things for her just because she\u2019s pregnant. \n\nWe got into a fight a few days ago. She insisted that she didn\u2019t feel good, and she thought something was wrong with the baby. She wanted to go to the hospital to make sure everything was okay. We\u2019ve been to the hospital for this kind of \u201cemergency\u201d almost four times since the beginning of her pregnancy. I had to go to work because we are severely understaffed, so I told her that if she still didn\u2019t feel good tonight we could go make sure everything was okay. She got upset with me, and she told me that I never take her pain serious. I told her that I can\u2019t drop everything any time she feels any discomfort. Pregnancy is uncomfortable. We argued some more then I left for work. When I got home I asked if she was feeling better, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me. She has stopped talking to me about her pregnancy now, and I feel like she is being manipulative. She\u2019s withholding information about my child because I didn\u2019t drop everything to take her to the hospital, again. I tried explaining to her my side of things and I apologized, but she\u2019s still mad at me. \n\nMy girlfriend is treating me like I\u2019m the asshole, but I feel like she isn\u2019t seeing how frustrated and tired I am from dropping everything for her.
