He shouldn't be asking him this. He should fly in earlier if he wants to hang out. Incredibly dumb ask for him to skip anything with you around your wedding for his birthday. Is he 13?

I'd ask him: we haven't even signed the papers yet and you want to break a promise you made me already? Is that how you want to start this marriage?\n\nThings are so complicated now that he might sulk the day after the wedding because he didn't get to spend the day with his friend. So what you need to do is to communicate, you need to tell him that it hurts you that he was willing to ditch the plans that you made TOGETHER, and that it hurts that he wanted to start this marriage by staying apart from you.

A good way to let him have time with his friend, to get to know his friend a bit yourself, to start your wedded life with a pretty awesome act of kindness and selflessness that will make your guy happy and then take the rest of the day to yourselves.

Not a great start to a marriage.", "The groom definitely has some bonding time available before the ceremony as long as none of them get wasted. As someone who's been on both sides of the wedding aisle party, grooms party >>>> bridal party.
