He gets along very well with my family but I don\u2019t have the best relationship with this. The reason being his brother. We will call him Brad. Brad is 4 years older than my fianc\u00e9, let\u2019s call him Chris, and throughout our relationship, Brad has always been a rude to me and Chris\n\nI had been in high school the same time Brad was. He would constantly say the N word and be very racist and he would always dehumanize woman and constant be misogynistic. When me and Chris started dating, he was never nice to me. \n\nI had been cheated on in my relationship before, so my trust was always questionable. Every time i would go over to Chris\u2019s house when we first started dating, Brad would always tell me Chris had a girl here before i came, or he would call me another name and say \u201coh sorry that\u2019s his other girlfriend\u201d and although i knew it was a joke, it would still get to me. I started to just ignore it but that would make him more mad so he stopped talking to me, which i didn\u2019t mind at all. Time goes by, Brad moves out, and all is well now, until one day he saw that Chris had my name under \u201cWife\u201d in his phone. Brad didn\u2019t like that so he starts spinning this stupid lie about how i\u2019m controlling chris. his mom started to dislike me because his other brothers have had issues with controlling girls, but I am far from controlling, chris is allowed to do anything as long as he\u2019s being faithful towards me. So Brad doesn\u2019t like me, and neither does Chris\u2019s parents now. Chris tries to explain to his parents im not controlling but they think that i\u2019m telling chris to say those things to them. \n\nI no longer felt welcome with Chris\u2019s family. Chris invited me on a vacation with him and his family. I said yes of course because i want chris to be happy, during this vacation it was clear by his whole family, i was not wanted there. So i kept my distance and stayed in my lane. \n\nAt one point during the vacation, they wanted to take a family photo, i stayed out of it until his aunt (the only person in his family who accepts me and enjoys my presence) insisted i got in the picture and she\u2019ll take it, then everyone started screaming \u201cNo No have OP take it\u201d His aunt said no, that she wants me in the picture. We\u2019re all getting in line for the picture, i put my arm around chris and Brad was on the other side of him and he grabs my arm and throws in back as hard as he could. i just had surgery on my shoulder a few months in advance so this really, REALLY hurt shoulder. nobody but chris believed me.\n\nAnyways, he has never supported me and Chris and he\u2019s tried countless of times to break us up or turn his entire family against me and I do not want him there at all. Chris agrees but he feels like it\u2019ll start issues between his family.

Marriage is difficult enough under \u201cideal\u201d circumstances. Imagine having a child with Chris and then having this child\u2019s uncle and grandparents show their disdain for you all the time. Imagine having to spend half your holidays with them - it will be miserable.

Seems like the rest of the family agrees with him so when they find out he's not invited then they might decide not to go as well in protest. That could be an issue for Chris.

That. \n\nBecause he still keeps bringing you back without any consequences for them. Every. Single.  Time. \n\nHe is sacrificing YOU to please them and have an illusion that everything is okay. \n\nYou are basically a sandwich for those crocodiles.\n\nIs that a life you want to live?", "Oh okay. But still. He is starting to get physical with you.", "How about asking Chris straight out- \u201cWho do you want at the wedding, me or him?\u201d\n\nNTA", "Sweetie please go find a man who loves you enough to NOT TOLERATE that behavior. I don't think this gut will. Don't waste time on him. Find your happiness.", "Chris needs to show that he will not tolerate the behavior.  He needs to set the boundary and enforce it.  He needs to do this by standing up for the non-invitation.  If you do the \"dirty work\" it will feed their dislike of you and the narrative that you are controlling Chris.\n\nTime for Chris to begin standing up to his family or this will be your life while with him.", "I might be missing something\u2026 is Chris agreeing to ban his brother from the wedding? He shouldn\u2019t be concerned with his family\u2019s feelings at all if he\u2019s agreeing to marry you.", "I'd offer one more chance but I'm a nice beast. seems like you have tried. maybe for your husband's sake offer one more time, what does he say about it?", "Why does he think you're controlling?", "I mean I'm sure the parents will prob try to excuse his BS or whatever but you can say, WE were trying to give him a chance, to see if he's changed, but the stakes are such that we just have no faith in him. \n\nI think it's just always better to let someone dig their own grave. It's also better to call it out in the moment bc you don't have to hide your upset.", "OP\u2026.it\u2019s not just Brad. Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family has an issue with your race darling. His family is racist and Chris honestly just doesn\u2019t want to face it.\n\nThis has not one thing to do with them thinking you\u2019re controlling and everything to do with the fact you\u2019re not whatever race they are. Brad started off saying the N word to insult you and your family members. He got that thinking from somewhere. This is why they don\u2019t want your melanated ass in the family picture.\n\nChris is going to have to make a tough decision here and that choice is going to either be with you or with his family. This will not be a situation where he can maintain both relationships because they have a fundamental issue with your very being, dear heart. It\u2019s time for him to choose.", "OP you have to put your foot down. I\u2019m sorry", "i agree and i think that would be the best case scenario for them to realize he would choose me over them, he\u2019s just trying to keep them in the picture for as long as he could you know? Brad is kind of the golden child and they think he\u2019s perfect in every aspect", "totally agree, it\u2019s still not okay and if his parents are allowing him to do these things with no consequences, what else could happen?", "If he doesn\u2019t stand up to his family about it, there will be no me in his life! Honestly i don\u2019t care what they think anymore, but obviously he does it\u2019s his family. so he needs to create those boundaries or deal with the consequences", "He agrees that he doesn\u2019t want Brad there, but he\u2019s deciding to not follow through with telling him that because he doesn\u2019t want to cause issues with him and his family", "One more chance??? How many chances does this guy need? She doesn\u2019t owe him anything and asking him for an apology will not go down well", "No reason, i\u2019ve never given anyone a reason to be controlling, the only time i\u2019ve ever controlled chris was when we were younger, he had these terrible friends and i told him that he can continue to be friends with them, but i wouldn\u2019t associate myself anywhere near him or them and get myself in trouble. but that was far after Brad started telling everyone i was controlling.", "Oh okay that was my original assumption. Time to rip the band-aid. It\u2019d also set a good example to the rest of his family as well as yours. And imo if a family doesn\u2019t have issues then it\u2019s not a real family", "um lol mist people who are mature understand the world doesn't revolve around them. she's only concerned because if her husband's sake. yea I'd give him another chance.", "agreed", "Ok the brother clearly isn\u2019t mature, he\u2019s been bullying her for years. She\u2019s concerned because she doesn\u2019t want him to ruin their wedding, and why does she want someone that tried for years to break them up there anyway?", "I hope he makes the smart decision. I can sympathize with you tho\u2026 I almost married into a family that condoned blackface on Halloween. Dodged a bullet", "again becasue it seems like op is an actual mature adult who thinks about others. some of you guys have been spoiled your whole lives and it shows", "that\u2019s terrible, i HATE people who act like that, and honestly, he doesn\u2019t have to cut ties with his whole family ofc, but if he doesn\u2019t cut ties with his brother, there may be some issues", "Right op seems very mature and has tried time and time again. He almost yanked her arm out of its socket. And the husband agrees he doesn\u2019t want him there yet is scared of his family that he\u2019s allowed to treat his fianc\u00e9 like crap for years", "Just elope and move far away.\n\nIf Chris can't stand p for you, and the wedding, then he will never be able to set out boundaries.\n\nNTA", "Nta horrible situation and honestly I don't know the answer but what I do know is if you don't invite him then future mother in law and rest of family will probably be upset at you for that, really tough decision you could still invite him and avoid him on the day but do you really want to be having to worry about avoiding people on your wedding day", "NTA for not wanting to invite Brad.\n\nYet, you are way too young to be marrying into this mess - especially since it sounds like Chris has cheated on you in the past.  Do you really want the rest of your life to be like this?\n\nWhy not go explore your options for awhile longer?  Travel, meet a variety of people, explore.  \n\nWhy lock yourself into this negative situation so early in life?", "The issue here is Chris. Yes, OP I understand he has defended you from his family before. But Chris's words are clearly not enough and he clearly needs to put actions behind those words. Chris needs to make it crystal clear to his family that OP is a part of his life, nothing they say or do will ever change that fact. So his family has two options. They can accept OP and the relationship between OP and Chris, and also treat her with respect they would any other family member. Or they will never be a part of Chris's life again. That means no wedding planning, no wedding, no family reunions, no funerals, no pregnancy announcements, no being at the hospital while OP gives birth, no getting to know any future grandchildren at all, and any other major life events in Chris's life. And Chris needs to back up his words 100%. If they can't accept OP they get nothing from Chris and nothing about Chris. Chris also needs to make clear that he and Brad don't have a close relationship. Chris needs to tell his family that Brad isn't his friend and they only see each other at family events. Chris needs to tell his family that he is fortunate enough to have people in his life he can always have open and honest conversations with when he feels he needs support, and that has never been Brad. Chris needs to straight up ask his family where do they think Brad is getting this information? Chris needs to ask Brad when did they have a conversation about OP's behavior in his relationship and why does he not remember it at all? It not normal to forget such a serious conversation, there would have to be something wrong with Chris to forget something so serious, but he hasn't forgotten any other serious conversations with any other family member. Chris needs to call out Brad in front of his family and ask for Brad to provide specific examples of abusive events or behaviors that where supposedly discuss in this private conversation that only Brad remembers. And when Brad fails to do so Chris needs to ask his family why they believed Brad's unproven words instead of listening to Chris, the person who is actually in the relationship and knows what is going on. Then Chris needs to rip his family a new one about treating OP so poorly after she has been nothing but nice to them and believing Brad without even thinking to talk to Chris first and see if any of it is true. Then Chris can repeat the two options, and tell them they can be apart of his and OP's life, or they can continue to believe the drama Brad creates because he is jealous of OP's and Chris's relationship. NTA but Chris needs to step up or nothing is going to change OP.", "If we were to move away from his family, we would also be moving away from my family", "Agreed!", "I agree!", "It\u2019s not necessarily chris himself, just his family. But he needs to set boundaries with them and either choose to love and accept me and my comfort, or his families", "I am not being blind at all, i can see this problem clear as day, but it\u2019s obvious that it either needs to be me, or his family", "theyre already upset with me and hate me! i have zero care about what they think about me haha", "Chris hasn\u2019t cheated! I was cheated on in my relationship before Chris. His brother is just an ass and saying those things to try to get me to leave. I agree that i\u2019m too young to marry into a mess like this tho!", ">even if he went NC they would still say that OP is controlling him\n\nBut who cares what they think or say once you're NC?", "You can not guarantee that though. If y\u2019all break up he can have his family around the kids on his time. (Yes there are ways around this but it\u2019s after the kids have already been around op being bad mouthed). Is he really worth having to deal with his family potentially for the rest of your life?", "Ah that\u2019s not a fun situation. \n\n When my brother got married, the Paster at her parents church told him to get her as far as he could away from them. Incredibly toxic people.", "Oh.  Ok.  No need to rush into marriage.  Think about how nice it would be to marry someone with a warm, welcoming, loving family.", "Chris always stands up for me! He isn\u2019t the problem, the only problem with Chris is that he is very unproblematic and doesn\u2019t want to start issues by not inviting him. He can either choose me, and either go low contact or no contact with his family, or he can choose them, and lose me to find someone his family can actually enjoy", "I am a different race, but to debunk this, some of his brothers also have girlfriends who are the same race as me, and are treated amazing", "Debunk, chris didn\u2019t allow it, he did go off and push around Brad, but nobody believed brad actually did it. I agree tho, i shouldn\u2019t have to be on a me or them situation. So chris does need to understand this isn\u2019t going to fix itself. and not inviting him to the wedding is the cherry on top to showing his brother who tf he\u2019s messing with.", "to debunk this, some of his brothers have girlfriends who are also different races or puerto rican like me, they get treated amazing! I don\u2019t think this is a race thing!", "That isn\u2019t unproblematic. I\u2019m conflict adverse as well but in a situation where there is an inevitable conflict he needs to pick the right one", "Again, excuse like \u201cI tried to tell them but nobody listened to me\u201d it only good for helpless 5 years old.  \n\nHe is enabling this nonsense. \n\nGrown up adults have this wonderful thing called boundaries. If you don\u2019t like my spouse and bully her that\u2019s time for us to go low contact/no contact. \nHe is not willing to uninvited his abusive brother from the wedding exactly why? He doesn\u2019t believe that he did it or just willingly slipped it away for \u201cfamily peace\u201d? And you what, not family equal to them so it\u2019s ok? \n\nYou have a future husband problem. Big one.", "Totally agree!", "He believes it happens, and he does stand up for me. I\u2019m there when it happens. He doesn\u2019t want to uninvited his brother so it doesn\u2019t cause more issues, but there\u2019s already issues so that\u2019s why he needs to grow up and decide if it\u2019s me or them", "I\u2019m sorry what kind of twisted logic it is?  Does he realize that this is sending signal to everyone in the family that they are indeed can hurt you and nothing will ever happen because apparently he is not willing to take any action to avoid \u201cissues\u201d. \n\nThink very carefully about what\u2019s your future will look like. This is just a free sample.", "Girl you\u2019re twisting yourself into knots when this should\u2019ve been a deal breaker years ago.", "You said it perfectly!", "So you ARE controlling! You do NOT GET TO CHOOSE for Chris. You do not get to decide he hasd to go low or no contact with his family. You can't tell him his children can't be around his family. Those are not choices you get to make on his behalf! All you can do is make choices for yourself. Chris is a man, an individual. He is allowed to make his own decisions, once he makes those decisions, you have to make yours...but understand....it is HIS DECISION, not yours!", "You\u2019re in a hard spot, which is why you need to sit down with Chris and lay it all out there.\nKids will be the issue. But if you explain your fears to Chris, there may be a solution. I just don\u2019t want you making a decision you regret later. Leaving Chris out of your thoughts on this isn\u2019t fair to either of you. Communication is important. \n\nAgain, good luck. I hope everything works out for you in a way you can be happy with.", "In that case he doesn't get an invite, what will your partner think of that though makes his relationship with his family bit awkward", "exactly, he can make his own decisions. I\u2019m not controlling at all, but his family has physically put me in danger and he has the decision. but i can\u2019t be with him anymore if i have to tie myself with his family. Never did i once say it was ever my decision.", "and for your information, he agrees with me 100%. he just doesn\u2019t want to cause more issues. but there are already issues.", "that\u2019s why i posted! he doesn\u2019t want him going either but he also doesn\u2019t want to cause anymore issues with his family", "This sounds like something for a couples counselor if y\u2019all can afford it. You obviously love him to take all this abuse from his family and he needs to be willing to protect you besides the \u201cshe\u2019s not controlling me\u201d speech that clearly isn\u2019t winning anyone over. I don\u2019t know how viable this marriage would be with Chris\u2019 family verbally abusing you and all they get it a slap on the wrist. Take care of yourself, OP I\u2019m sorry you are dealing with this family of in laws from hell", "Now you are lying. In another post you said it happened when Chris was 17 and too afraid to stand up to his brother. You keep insisting that YOU have decided that both of you have to go low or no contact with Chris's family. That any children you have will NEVER be around Chris's family...again a decision YOU have made for children that belong to BOTH you and Chris. Something tells me that Brad and Chris's family find you controlling has some basis in fact. Nothing justifies abuse, but your posts are starting to contradict themselves and I have to wonder. I also have to wonder what kind of a traumatic serious relationship you had BEFORE Chris, meaning before you were 16, that Brad taunted you with. You all have no business getting married until you all grow the hell up.", "lmao have you personally talked to chris? when did i EVER say it was ME making the decisions and not me AND chris? Never. yeah when it first happened he didn\u2019t say anything, but when we got back to the condo\u2019s, and brad came into the room, he stood up and said something about it. you\u2019re literally looking for evidence of me being controlling but i\u2019m literally not. i\u2019ve never controlled chris. he\u2019s his own person. he makes decisions too. but sometimes we make decisions together on behalf of each others comfort. and i haven\u2019t decided anything about low to not contact. everything is still in discussion and play until we figure out wtf their issue is with me. so until you want to quit attacking me for lies that you\u2019re feeding to urself, maybe read the full story!", "also, there was no \u201ctraumatic serious relationship\u201d before chris. Everyone has relationships as teenagers, that\u2019s the time we are most curious and vulnerable, so don\u2019t act like i\u2019m some \u201ctraumatized\u201d person just because i had a high school relationship that didn\u2019t end well.", "NTA.  Are you sure you want to marry into this family?", "You are way way to young to be signing up for a lifetime of garbage or a short marriage. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t looking to cut ties with his family any time soon so you should just move on from this relationship.", "Umm...why are you still with Chris? You know that he doesn't respect you, right? His brother physically hurt you and his fam didn't give af...and Chris hasn't limited contact or tried to put a stop to this abuse? Maybe don't marry Chris until he can actually be faithful to you. There's more to being faithful than not fucking other people. He doesn't have your back. If you'll be his wife, he needs to protect you from his abusive family. NTA though, i guess", "Umm...why are you still with Chris? You know that he doesn't respect you, right?

NTA though, i guess", "NTA, at the end of the day i feel like the more you try being around them it might lead to other things. On top of that your husband could have also felt with his brother when he grabbed your arm and hurt it. He had zero rights putting his hands on you and the fact they said they was lying mean if you went out with them again and get hurt they will probably leave you there saying your lying which isn\u2019t okay at all.", "Am I the only one who gets creepy rapey vibes from Brad?", "Yes, she has a Chris problem, not a Brad problem.", "You need some time away from Chris so you can both sort out your feelings and problems.", "If you won\u2019t make him choose, he\u2019ll continue to allow them to abuse you. The only question is, will you?", "Please remember the comment about Brad (and Chris\u2019s whole family, IMO) potentially abusing your children.", "He agrees. That\u2019s lip service. He needs to DO something about it. My mother once told me something I thought was cruel at the time. I was telling her about being abused. She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll take it as long as you want to.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize until after I\u2019d left that she was right. You\u2019re young with your whole life ahead of you. Don\u2019t ever settle. Find someone who cares enough to protect you from abuse.", "You just said you\u2019d never ask him to choose. Now it\u2019s \u201che needs to grow up and decide if it\u2019s me or them.\u201d Which is it?", "NTA, but unless Chris sets some boundaries and deals with his family, this will be your life.  \n\nDo you want to spend the next 60 years being treated badly at family gatherings. If you want kids, will they treat kids badly because they don\u2019t like you.\n\nChris HAS to deal with this before you get married.", "Clearly he hasn't done enough though and still prioritises his family over  your comfort, safety and happiness if he is even considering inviting his brother to the wedding.", "Abseloutly NTA. \"Brad\" is the controlling one. Pushing you out, so he can have his best friend back, just like old times.\n\nI am relieved \"Chris\" is on your side, because if \"Brad\" is in the mood to grab randomly, then theres no saying what else he could do to get his way.\n\nPlus, I am dissapointed in his family for jumping to conclusions unecessary. Yes, its happened before, but maybe take a step back and not assume its a done deal.\n\nWhose to say \"Brad\" did not have a hand in the previous controlling relationships?", "NTA at all omg, they are awful (apart from the aunt). I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. \u201cIt\u2019ll start issues\u201d by un-inviting a racist bully who is vile, start those issues! Show there are consequences. I can\u2019t believe your fianc\u00e9 would be ok with inviting him. Is this the kind of family you want to marry in to?", "So, when y'all were taking the photo, the only person who wanted you in the photo was the aunt, not Chris? Girl, he's not standing up for you. He's a Mama's boy and always will be. This will not change. If you marry him, his mom will always be #1. You are optional, his mom is not. Choose wisely.", "NTA OP, but since it\u2019s apparent that your fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t stand up for you, then perhaps it\u2019s time to cut ties with not only him, but his whole toxic family.", "NTA. His family is terrible, especially brad. And your fiance agrees. I do not really know where your confusion is. Do not invite them. \n\nThere has to be a more structural solution, however. I think it is clear that they will never accept you. And i do not think there is a point in you trying to have a good relationship with them anymore. So maybe stop engaging withthem. And see to kt that Chris also asks hinself how much contact he wants, and that he is on Board with it. I know people where the in-laws and the dil do not meet anymore because of thesethings\n\nYou said brad uses racist slurs. Are you black? That would give this a whole even worse Dynami. if they resent you purely because of your skin color, ghen boubdaries has to be Set in stone.", "Who he's dealing with is someone who is weak and won't stand up for herself. You don't look tough on this scenario. You look like someone with low self-esteem who allows mistreatment from her boyfriend's entire family.", "You're barely past teenager now, and you don't sound more mature than one."]}
