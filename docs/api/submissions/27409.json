My equally as drunk husband told her no again and went off on her about why we couldn't do something else somewhere else that everyone can go and enjoy and then it was dropped. I have not talked with my kids about this, I'm not sure how to yet.

It's the most woke thing in Florida right now :D And economically, it's basically impossible to go to Disney and not just be supporting Disney, unless you hotel off premises and eat off premises- which is fine also, because I can tell you right now those businesses don't want to deal with this any more than you do.", "I live in Florida and I know people like this they had to move for their safety because of hate messages they been getting just because my friend is gay so no person including her kids would be safe here", "NTA, Don't support bigotry that runs rampant in Florida.

My son is trans and my husband\u2019s parents and sister and her family are Floridians living in Tampa and St. Pete. In St. Pete there are still pride parades and pride in the park events in June. Many, many lgbtq people live and work there. There are rainbow flags up in many parts of town year round. There are still street signs with rainbow pride on them. Plus, Disney World is quite lgbtq friendly in every park and the surrounding areas. I firmly believe it is friendly and safe for lgbtq individuals and their loved ones at Disney. They also have good security and low instances of crime/violence. I wouldn\u2019t say that if I thought otherwise.

Would we be safe if we went to florida? Probably.

They're all horrible laws, and some of them will be inevitably struck down because of their unconstitutionality. None of the laws that you have cited will affect OP's child though, so I'm not sure what you are asking.", "Only one law could be said to even Have a slight possibility to impact OP's child, and that would be the bathroom law. The rest of them have to do with the public school system, or with custody, or with gender affirming care.", "Well, OP probably has as much understanding of the laws of Florida as some of the other people in this thread. I would urge people to actually research what they're talking about before they begin acting like experts.", "While you may not agree with this legislation, it doesn't make Florida some hellscape where it is unsafe to walk around if you are LGBT+.", "Again, the 12 year old is not in danger. Her older brother or sister is the one who ultimately has the issue & \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel safe\u201d. I said what I said.", "I mentioned in literally every post I made that I was talking about a counterfactual situation.   OP is not doing anything that their child disagrees with, they're fine.\n\nWhether or not it would be safe for an LGBT+ person to vacation at Disney right now is up to the individual person going.\n\nThe point I made, and that you've refused to engage with, is that decisions like these about what a NB person should do *should be made by the NB person themself*.  That it shouldn't be on mom to say \"I don't like the laws they passed, so you can't go to Disney World\", that's *not her call to make*.\n\nFor the last time, that's not what's happening here, but 1) I didn't originally know that and 2) my point is true regardless of whether or not it applies to this situation.", "I think they were more trying to make the point that non-binary people will be targeted because the bigots do not see a difference between them and a trans person.", "The laws and policies being pushed will be applied to non-binary folks whether you consider yourself trans or not.", "From wikipedia: \"Non-binary[a]\u00a0and\u00a0genderqueer\u00a0are\u00a0umbrella terms\u00a0for\u00a0gender identities\u00a0that are not solely male or female (identities outside the\u00a0gender binary).[2][3]\u00a0Non-binary identities fall under the\u00a0transgender\u00a0umbrella, since non-binary people typically identify with a\u00a0gender\u00a0that is different from their\u00a0sex,[3]\u00a0though some non-binary people do not consider themselves transgender.[4][5]\"", "\"I end the conversation when someone even remotely challenges my viewpoints with their own\"\n\nNot even super hostile, bud. Grow a thicker skin", "So laws that are passed and supported by those in power are just things I'm making up? I've said nothing that isn't sourced meanwhile you have said nothing but \"well in my personal experience\" like sure, for most of that 20 years experience this hasn't been HAPPENING", "Both things can be true -- the laws being passed put trans people in danger, AND your lived experience in Florida isn't watching trans people getting arrested off the street.", "https://newrepublic.com/post/172444/florida-passes-bill-allowing-trans-kids-taken-families\n\nThis one definitely could, as could any number of bigoted moves by the state", "It kinda does? They also now have one that allows the state to remove children from their family if they think the child is \"at risk\" of gender affirmative care.\n\nThis is the beginning of much worse being passed and it's understandable for anyone in the community to be uncomfortable there", "And if that turns out to be the case then maybe that'll change things but as far as OP has said and until the have a chance to ask, it sounds like the youngest is showing solidarity for their sibling.  Also idk about you but I'd not want to go somewhere my sibling felt unsafe, I'm just not an asshole like that", "OP literally said they spoke to their child about it and the kids were all onboard but grasp I guess?"]}
