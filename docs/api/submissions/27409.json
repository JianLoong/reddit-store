It's the most woke thing in Florida right now :D And economically, it's basically impossible to go to Disney and not just be supporting Disney, unless you hotel off premises and eat off premises- which is fine also, because I can tell you right now those businesses don't want to deal with this any more than you do.", "I live in Florida and I know people like this they had to move for their safety because of hate messages they been getting just because my friend is gay so no person including her kids would be safe here", "NTA, Don't support bigotry that runs rampant in Florida.

Many, many lgbtq people live and work there. There are rainbow flags up in many parts of town year round. There are still street signs with rainbow pride on them. Plus, Disney World is quite lgbtq friendly in every park and the surrounding areas. I firmly believe it is friendly and safe for lgbtq individuals and their loved ones at Disney. They also have good security and low instances of crime/violence. I wouldn\u2019t say that if I thought otherwise.

Would we be safe if we went to florida? Probably.

If there\u2019s a parent with 100% custody, the other parent can take the kid and gain 100% custody, even if they\u2019ve never met before. \n\nIf a person takes a kid from a different state, and drives across state lines, that kid, according to the state of Florida, would now 100% theirs and they will not cooperate with anyone. \n\nAgain, this is all based on the *suspicion* of a kid being \u201cexposed to transgenderism\u201d. \n\nIn other words Florida is proposing laws to make kidnapping legal just so there\u2019s no trans people. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just \u201cwell they wanted to go!\u201d This is \u201cthe state of Florida can take away your kid for existing\u201d. I\u2019ll let the other comments about the law already on the book about the state taking custody of kids if they have had any gender affirming care stand on their own. There\u2019s a map made of US states and how dangerous/safe they are for trans people. \n\nThere is only one state that has a \u201cDo not travel\u201d advisory, and it\u2019s Florida.", "I think I chose the word flamboyant bc they can dress very colorfully depending on how they feel and they have multi colored hair and like you said outspoken", "I don\u2019t disagree with the first part of your comment.

You're right, I think they're safe inside the park (except for the literal Nazis protesting outside it). But they're not just going to be at the park.  \n\n\nIt's not fear mongering to be justifiably afraid of all the limits on trans people's rights being passed in FL. Even the 16 y/o NB agrees that they wouldn't feel safe.", "It's dystopian AF. I lived in Texas for a while and it started getting like this too so I cashed in my chips and claimed my Canadian dual citizenship (parent is Canadian) and moved up there. 10/10 recommend.   \n\n\nI'm not even trans but I am queer and I have a uterus and neither of these places feel safe.", "Leprosy isn't a human only disease, so it really can't be eradicated like smallpox, and while cases of it are rare you can technically get it from wild animals, notably armadillos. \n\nGranted everytime a cute dilla is posted somewhere, *someone* will make a leprosy comment.

Bad information on my part.", "It's more about holding a child back for adult problems. \n\nI get that it affects their sibling, but let's be real - Disney is a huge experience to kids, is actually a company trying to stand up to Florida's insane government, and her going does not literally cause anyone actual harm. \n\nAnd she has not said she'll go, out of guilt, which I think shows she doesn't dismiss the issues. I just think sometimes people don't need to suffer for their principles when it makes no difference other than to their own happiness.", "Just because you don\u2019t see it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. The fact that this law even passed is terrifying enough", "I just keep thinking about how one of the best places in the world to be queer, in 1931,  was Berlin.  Scores of gay bars, gender-affirming science was in its heyday, surgeons were advancing all sorts of medical techniques, cultural blending was common and better-accepted than anywhere else in the West.\n\nBy 1935, it was hell.\n\nA *lot* of people in 1933 were saying and writing things like, \"Realistically, what do you expect to happen?\"", "State law requires them to treat it as serius, physcal abuse on par with broken bones or sexual abuse.\n\nState law also makes it illegal for teachers to give children the bad touch talk, so kids won't know to report things like bad touch.

There are groups of anti gay gangs driving around in pickup trucks with Trump flags waving and looking for gays to terrorize.

I support OP wanting to keep children safe. If anything goes even remotely wrong there (hospital, kids get separated, etc) all bets are off. I don't think I'm magically safe in a blue state where I am, but I sure as hell am not safe in a state like Florida.  \n\n\nAlso, we're not even just talking about threats of violence or separation (which are also real threats), we're talking about taking a gender diverse kid and putting them in an environment where there's already more bigotry and hatred thrown at them than they'd expect on home turf. That's not an acceptable risk for a teenager already dealing with a really goddamn scary world. Terfs can downvote me all they want, I really don't care.", "I'm reminded of people paranoid about big cities being crime-ridden, but mostly that's neighborhoods tourists would be avoiding anyway. \n\nLike I was fine in downtown Baltimore, I wasn't going to West Baltimore and especially not Cherry Hill", "See I know many women who have safely backpacked throughout south east Asia including Afghanistan (during the war even) and all over safely.

Part of being a part of an international community and educating yourself on these issues means being aware of what people are experiencing. And while this trans kid will probably not be attacked they will have to deal with fears about washrooms and walking down the street. They will have people comment and throw things and do other shitty things that makes you feel like crap. Transphobia is rampant and we need to call it out rather than shielding the bastards that hurt us. Florida wants to exterminate us and if we don\u2019t fight back people will die. It\u2019s as simple as that. Even if you didn\u2019t vote for the bastard, you aren\u2019t doing anything to get rid of him either. You\u2019re all on the wrong side of history and this will be another ww2 situation. I\u2019m just being vocal so no one can claim the whole \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was happening\u201d bullshit. If there was public pushback against desantis and his goons I\u2019d be more inclined to say it\u2019s ok. But as long as people defend transphobia and continue to stick their head in the sand and pretend everything\u2019s fine then you are the problem. All I see is people defending transphobia and doing nothing to protect the trans community.

Legally, in Florida she should use the men\u2019s room.  Sorry, she looks female. It\u2019s scary to think what would happen there.
