There is too much here. No one is perfect & everyone makes mistakes. All that matters is y\u2019all are doing your best. If it\u2019s not working, get help", "This is really complicated so NTA. You said not great things and you owned it an apologized- but your siblings are too old.to be breaking a TV. Make them earn it back.\n\nIt's time to have a calm and collected conversation with your sister about the person your mother truly is. Explain the drug addiction and what that truly means. Explain that you did not remove your siblings from your mothers home, the state did because she is _not safe or fit to be a parent_. At anytime your mother could have gotten her act together and fought for her kids. Explain to your sister that while you understand she wants to be with her mother, legally you cannot allow her to do that. Your mother _lost them_ due to her problems.\n\nI'm so sorry OP. You are an amazing sibling. They are so lucky to have you and I pray they see it soon!", "NAH. All of you are just trying to figure all of this out as you go, with no real supports to help and guide you. You did screw up by saying that, but I don\u2019t think you meant it maliciously. You were frustrated and had a moment of weakness- every parent can relate.\n\nShe\u2019s 15. Her brain and hormones are a mess. She wants her mom. She lashes out at you because you\u2019re safe, she knows you\u2019d never abandon her like everyone else. You saying what you did sent the message you could abandon her too. You need to apologize and repair that. \n\nBut you know what? You\u2019re still not an asshole. You\u2019re doing the best you can, and damn it, that is okay. You all need a crap-ton of therapy, but you also need a kudos for doing your best to keep your family together.", "NTA\u2026. But she needs some major therapy to work through all this. Both kids and maybe yourself. This just sounds like a lot of unresolved trauma.", "Jesus, that was heavy. I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve said that, but I think it\u2019s understandable that you would want them to understand the shit you went through. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. She\u2019ll understand some day.", "NTA but I would seek counseling for your sister to help process her emotions and navigate her relationship with your mom.  I would definitely expect her to be mean towards you and demonize you and prioritize your mom for a time.  Hopefully she'll come to realize the reality.\n\nJust a newsflash/PSA: We all fail as parents.  You stepped up in an incredibly difficult situation.  Your siblings are very lucky they have you, whether they realize it or now.", "NTA, you're just trying your best. The way you expressed what happened to you and your siblings wasn't the best, try to sit both of them down and talk out what happened. I think the best course of action is to let your emotions cool down and get everyone on the same page.", "\nYou are effectively your sisters mom. 99% of 15 year old girls hate their mom (made up statistic). I know you didn\u2019t get to experience a normal mother daughter relationship with your mom but coming from someone who had a supportive loving mother/typical childhood and still hated her mom from probably 14-18, just try to stay loving and wait it out. She will realize how much you have done for her with time but there is no way to punish or convince her to get there faster. Try really hard to keep that in mind and not accidentally give her genuine reason to feel negatively about you and don\u2019t waste your time trying to convince her or show her that your bio mom was the problem. Just love her and eventually she will see it on her own\n\nETA - NTA but be careful with future conversations or you might turn into one", "It's was an AH thing to say yeah, but it's understandable that you would snap in this situation. You should never have been put in this position and you are playing a very difficult dual role. NTA but please get all three of you into family counseling. Your all victims of the same awful perpetrator and you need to heal together.", "NTA \n\nI am so sorry about the situation with your mom. Addiction is powerful and awful for all involved. Your sister is clinging to some fantasy that will never happen. I would sit her down and tell her what you told us. Tell her how much you love her and that you did the best you could. Point out you were three years older than she is now and had MUCH bigger worries. Not that it should belittle how she is feeling, but she does need to know relationships don\u2019t revolve around just her. Further more certainly not for someone you\u2019ve described as such an unfit human. Good  luck! Teenagers are at a weird place in life (normal but hard and weird).", "YTA, but all parents say something they refer to their kids at some point. You were doing the best you can with what sounds like no real support. Ok the other hand, I imagine your sister has always wanted your mother's attention and now that she is getting it, your sister is going to do whatever she can to stay on your mom's good side. But she will figure out who has been there for her all along. \n\n\nI hope you all have been able to get therapy for all of the traumas you've experienced.", "NTA. Your sister needs counseling and you do too. You need to figure out with a therapist how to tell them the truth about their mother. And I mean all of it because, if you don't, they will only have her version, which will be lies.\n\nI think you are a complete badass warrior queen to get yourself together at 18 when you probably experienced abuse and neglect yourself and take on this responsibility for the past 12 years. Raising someone else's kids can be a thankless job at times, and the parent(s) will treat you like a mortal enemy but don't be discouraged. If you keep at it, they will see the truth and you will be close again. Good luck :-)", "NTA. You really can\u2019t keep your sister from having a relationship or being in contact with your mom though, if that\u2019s what she wants.", "NTA. Counseling for all would be ideal. Your sister is just young enough to have a dream that she was unjustly separated from her perfect mother and not the reality of it. That her mother's addiction was more important than she was. The benefit to her for counseling is obvious. Boys tend to keep things in, he nay need an outlet himself. For you, it's a means of learning to navigate this whole mess your mother and grandmother created so that you can guide your siblings thru this and hopefully avoid saying things you would later regret. You were abandoned by the adults in your life too, and it might help you to hear that you matter. I wish all the best for the three of you.", "NTA, you're a child raising children. Learn from your mistakes and its okay that your sister is giving you attitude. She's 15. All parental figures have said something they regret but you need to get better about saying more compassionate things because they are children and you are an adult.", "Soft YTA. But not for saying that. \n\nSounds like you're pampering them? Breaking a flat screen TV would've resulted in serious grounding. Lol. You don't break property and have the person whose property you broke apologise to you. That's just bad parenting. Be a strict and fair parent. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nBut I'd have just told the kid to leave if she so desperately wants to so what do I know.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you have been through a lot and somehow managed to become a better person than your mother or grandmother.  Well done.\n\nYou have custody of your sister and for good reason.  Just let her know that your are sorry for saying what you did in the heat of the moment.  I\u2019m sure she knows that you love her.\n\nBig problem is mom. You are going to have to hold her at arm\u2019s length - she is already causing problems.  Your sister will just have to understand that it is best for everyone that she wait until she is 18 to reconnect with your mom if she wants to.", "NTA.  Your in a tough situation though.  \n\nYour mom probably fed your sister a lot of lies, that'll be challenging to fix.", "NTA I can sense how frustrated you are. It must have been tough for you over the years. If you can afford therapy then please get it. Please take care of yourself OP and ignore your mother. Your sister will find out who she really is in a matter of time. Teenagers are the worst to deal with. Good luck!", "NAH. You are as far from being an AH as you possibly can be. You have singlehandedly rescued and raised your siblings when you were were barely an adult yourself. Great job! Hang in there! Your sister is acting like most teenagers act at some point in time, even with their own parents in so-called normal homes. It's good that you gave her a reality check, but I'm sure she knows what you have done and are doing for her. She'll come around. I doubt she'll go to live with mom, but if she does, she'll be back within days. Teens are rebellious, but they're smart. They know who provides a safe environment for them. That being said, all of you have been through a lot, and you deserve some extra support. Can you go to counseling together? That might be beneficial for all of you. Good luck!", "NTA. You have to figure out a better way to engage your sister in a positive way and not yell at your siblings when something goes wrong. Yelling is counterproducive and all ther hear is the yelling and not the message you wanted to give them. You also can't threaten to send her to foster care. To engage her in a positive way, you probably need to apologize for some of things you said in anger and let her know you are going to try and do better. And she is old enough to understand if you explain why you had to take custody in the first place. \n\nOnce you start talking to her offer her a 'girls day or night out'. Take her to ther mall to buy some clothes, a special dinner or a movie and try to say things that will help you bond with her. Also, assign your siblings chores to help around the house and give them an allowance.\n\nI don't think you should block her from talking to her mom because she will figure out another way to do it anyway and after  all, for good or bad she is her mom. But let her know if your mom is trying to throw you under the bus in what she says about you, your sister must know that that is not true and she should ask your mom steer the converstaion in another direction because it is rude to talk about someone behind their back. You may even want to go aganst your grain and invite your mom over for a meal to see the children in person, if she agrees to behave. \n\nFinally, she is a minor and you have legal custody and let her know she can't move in with your mom so let he know that she may get picked up by the police and brought home. Let her know that a minor staying with another adult when you have custody is like kidnapping and your mom will get in trouble if sister goes there and she does not send her home.", "Soft YTA. She's a kid who's been through a lot. She's young and impressionable and her mother has been manipulating her. She'll appreciate the sacrifices you've made for her when she gets older and matures. \n\nI can't fully blame you for losing your temper and saying something you shouldn't have, because you essentially were forced to become a mother at a young age. You've given up a lot and I'm sure it was upsetting to have her react this way. But you knew better, and what you said was more hurtful than anything.\n\nYou're in a tough situation, and I'm sure you're doing your best, but you need to fix this. Apologize to her and tell her you didn't mean what you said. Try to build a support system for her, whether that's you or other family/friends or actual therapy. This is a tough situation for her too, and she's going to need help getting through it. You don't want to push her to your mom since that is clearly not a safe option for her.", "Well you did not handle that well, this is when you have the awful conversation about what your bio mom was up to and why they were taken away.\n\nYTA, you handled that extremely poorly and never should have said that to her,", "NTA\nyes that was a horrible thing to say but you do not deserve the treatment you are getting from her either. It is definitely a tough situation for everyone though.", "NTA You spoke harshly yes, but your sister is 15 too. Let her go on with her mood, she\u2019ll be alright after a while.", "YTA, but, you\u2019re 30 and knew it when you said it.", "YTA - as awful as your mom a kid wanting to be in contact with their parent and wanting their parents approval is fairly natural, it takes a long time for a kid to accept if their parents are shitty and that they wont be the parent they want. Just as it is natural that she\u2019s lashing out now you\u2019ve forced her too cut contact with her mom. \n\nRealistically she needs to have been in therapy to help process and accept the realities of her situation a long time before she even got into contact with her mom. \nThis also should\u2019ve been a conversation about how and why the things her mom is saying are wrong, why her mom isn\u2019t as good as she portrays herself and that she is being manipulative. I really don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t supervise this child\u2019s interactions with a known abuser closer?", "YTA.\n\nThat's a horrible thing to say to a kid. It's normal for a kid to want to know their mom, and it sounds like she has some legit complaints about you being emotionally abusive.", "YTA you are the adult and instead of showing her unconditional love you made her feel as though you wished you had left her in foster care", "NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A lot of kids don't know the horrors once inside. \n\nHave her go into crisis care (short-term removal from home) and see the bare minimum of what happens.\n\nSure you can end up in a decent home, but more times than not you end up with people who don't care about you and only want the check every month OR you get assaulted if any form you can think of OR you end up in a group home. And some group homes are pretty much a juvenile detention center.\n\nI do understand what she's talking about, but she doesn't have the full story. All she knows is she grew up without her mom. And she's angry about it.\n\nYou telling her \"I could have left you there\" isn't wrong. It's not kind but not wrong either. It was more blunt fact than anything. \n\nYou're not an asshole, and I commend you for taking them in and raising them. Good job. I'm proud of you!", "NAH, you were both angry and lashed out. Raising kids is hard. Being a kid with a parent who wasn't properly parented is extremely difficult, and teen years are always tough. You both need time to calm down. As far as seeing your mom. If it can be done safely, you should allow some contact. Part of the allure is the belief that mom's home would be better. More time together will show your sister why things are this way. You could look into a visitation center where mom has to pay a small fee for contact. They're supervised by professionals.", "NTA\n\nHarsh, but true.  You used your life to try and fix the damage your mother caused, you went above and beyond to help your siblings, and considering what you are being given in return for that?\n\nI'm totally fine you giving her an honest view of how things could have worked out.", "Throw your sister out, she\u2019s ungrateful", "Same scenario happened to me when I was growing up. My sisters always resented me as their caretaker and would say things like \u201cyou\u2019re not my mom you can\u2019t do xyz\u2026\u201d. But I realized they\u2019re teenagers and all they\u2019re thinking is, why can\u2019t I be with my mom they don\u2019t understand. Give it five years when they actually understand the sacrifices you\u2019ve made for them and they\u2019ll be so grateful for what you\u2019ve done.", "NTA, but yah need counseling.", "This. OP, I know therapists are expensive, but go see one. Meet with the therapist first and explain everything, then go to the therapist together and separately. Your sister is going to just keep building your mom up as perfect and you as the problem unless someone helps her process all of this.", "So, I have BPD.  That sort of lashing out is one of the hallmarks of uncontrolled BPD behaviour.   It's actually pretty abusive, and needs to be shut down before it becomes an ingrained behaviour.\n\nBeing called out for making that assumption?  Totally justified, and needed.\n\nEverybody has limits to what they can stand, and turning your back because you are tired of being abused?  totally acceptable behaviour.\n\nTreat anyone badly enough, no matter the relationship, and, yes, they will leave you behind.  Learning there are limits to how you treat others is vital to being a decent person.\n\nThere is no truly unconditional love, and as this sub loves to say, \"family ties only go so far\".", "Do you think the kids will get therapy when op puts them in foster care ?", "People will often bottle up emotions around people they don't trust to love and be there for them. They can't express themselves to someone they can't trust to love them anyway despite exploding. But let loose when dealing with someone they trust because they can let their guard down. They'll love through anything. That person is safe.", "This sub likes to forget that parents are humans too, not just punching bags. Teens lash out but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to put up with abuse. Imo OP reached her breaking point. Was it a nice thing to say? No. But she\u2019s human too.", "OP can\u2019t defend herself in case it might hurt her sister? Yeah, no. Unless OP abused her, anything she may/may not have done properly isn\u2019t her fault. She was **eighteen** when she took in her toddler sister. That\u2019s not an easy feat. And if her sister wants to rag on her about it, OP absolutely has the right to defend herself, when she sacrificed much of her life to take care of her.", "Agree on all points.\n\nAnd OP, you are NTA stop letting yourself feel guilty that you snapped a bit. It happens. You are under tremendous stress. People like you are angels but also human sometimes, and that's ok.", "It\u2019s very possible they don\u2019t have many benefits from their local government, kinship placements often don\u2019t receive the same benefits as official foster care placements.", "This is a horrible thing? They probably forgot about it ages ago! You're being way too hard on yourself now! Come on. Cut yourself some slack. You're doing a fantastic job!!! The fact that you're concerned about this itself is proof of that! Don't agonise over this old incident.", "Ha.  Welcome to the mostly thankless world of parenting, though I\u2019m sure you know that.  You will never win with a 15yr old most of the time!!  They won\u2019t appreciate the sacrifices you made for them nor should you blame them for the sacrifices.   I agree with others that consoling would help.  I would also sit both the kids down and have a talk about what happened from the beginning with your mom.  They are at least old enough to understand some of it.  And then they can make the decision on how they feel about it.  She might have to get burn by her mom to believe you.   I have learned over years that just yelling at my kids does little at that age, unfortunately.   I still do it because it just happens.  But I think it\u2019s good to be aware enough to apologize when necessary but just for the over reaction. Breaking the tv and sending them to bed early seems like a normal reaction.  Don\u2019t hate on yourself to much.  Have you talk with your mom about this?  I have also learned that being the calmest one in the room and not petty wins over full on arguments.  But explaining to your sister that mom has hurt people before with her lies and she needs to be aware of that.  I imagine she is going to get hurt eventually by your mom and I\u2019m not sure you can prevent that.", "Why don\u2019t you just get rid of her ?", "Why not just put the one kid in foster care ?", "Considering she isn\u2019t even speaking to op I absolutely confident they remember", "She's a human being and my sister who I raised.\n\nGetting rid of her is not an option", "Borderline Personality Disorder says hi.\n\nThat behaviour is a huge part of BPD.   Same reasons.  \"Big\" emotions."]}
