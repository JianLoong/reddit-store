I'll use GF for GF (F25) and Elle for sister (F19). I'm M29 for reference.\n\nMy GF's birthday was a few months back and we live around an hour away from my family home. My family home consists of my two younger sisters & my mum. Around the time, my mum was bedbound due to illness - generally OK but very fatigued & I was talking to her most days to check in. As she was ill, she had my sisters go out and buy bits for my GF's birthday present (a little pamper hamper) and post it to us.\n\nThe gift arrived & my GF loved it. My mum had put something on GF's Facebook to wish her a happy birthday & GF replied to this saying thank you for the wishes & gift. She didn't message her separately & it's worth mentioning I don't think my mum saw the Facebook comment reply.\n\nA few days later, Elle messaged me and was quite aggressive from the first message. Said GF was rude and shitty for not messaging mum directly to say thank you, and that mum hadn't had any acknowledgement despite being ill and organising a gift. Told her we'd been away & busy for GF's birthday, but that GF had replied om Facebook. Elle said mum was upset, so I asked GF to follow up with a message which she did. Mum hadn't seen the Facebook comment & all was good.\n\nI told Elle she was out of line for coming at me & GF so aggressively, calling GF rude & shitty etc. At this point I don't care who was right or wrong, just that she started calling names without even talking about things. GF is upset with Elle and wants nothing to do with her until she gets an apology.\n\nElle's stance is that it's my fault for telling GF that she called her stuff, she doesn't see what she has to apologise for. I told her until she does, I'm not talking to her. I'm over the whole situation but GF won't attend family events where Elle is present (so as not to cause a scene, make things awkward etc & out of principle. I'm standing with her.\n\nMum & the rest of the family agree that Elle should apologise. Since Elle still lives at home, it means that GF & I no longer go over for a Sunday dinner, BBQs & in the near future we'll be missing my Nan's birthday meal. They're contemplating uninviting Elle from family events but I don't want that either.\n\nElle does mistreat most people, is aggressive to manipulate situations and conversations to her benefit & gets away with a lot. This is one reason why GF doesn't want to just drop it.\n\nAITA & being childish, or am I justified?", "created_utc": 1686904979, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14arfy1/aita_for_backing_my_gf_against_my_sister/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But why are you punishing the rest of the family for Elle\u2019s behavior?  You\u2019re going to miss your Nan\u2019s birthday because of your sister\u2019s mouth.  What did your Nan do to deserve that? Are you making it up to Nan in some other way?  Your issue is with Elle and you\u2019re making your family collateral damage, which is why the family is talking about uninviting Elle (which you said you don\u2019t want either).  For that, YTA because she\u2019s still acting like a kid at 17, but so are you at 29.  \n\nTalk with your family about boundaries with Elle and if you show up to a family meal and Elle disrespects your GF, let your parents apply parental prerogative and send her off to her room.", "ESH\n\nLook, I get your sister is an AH. But she is kind of right that replying in Facebook is something you do for casual and somewhat close acquaintances, and your GF should have replied in a more formal way (what's wrong with a phone call?).\n\nI also think you and your GF are AHs because you are forcing your family to choose a side. For Pete's sake, your sis didn't call your GF a horrible name, a racial slur or something really nasty. Calling her behavior shitty (which kinda was) to be honest is quite mild and the normal behavior should be ignoring her after your confrontation.\n\nYour family are also AHs if they are really using this excuse to ostracize your sister.", "ESH. GF should have responded directly to your mom. If she had to involve herself, Ellie should have directly approached GF, and without the nasty attitude. *hey, GF, my mom wanted to make sure you received and enjoyed your gift* would have been a kinder hint that a direct thank you was needed.\n\nYou mom shouldn't have been dragged into this drama. You and your sister are adults. You can settle your own differences without someone running to mommy to referee.\n\nAnd now you are all acting like giant toddlers holding this grudge. Your mom gets to suffer now over the immature behavior of her adult children.", ">Said GF was rude and shitty for not messaging mum directly to say thank you, and that mum hadn't had any acknowledgement despite being ill and organising a gift. \n\nWhere in this message did your sister insult your gf? Your sister pointed out your gf's behaviour, not calling/texting/DM-ing your Mum to say thank you, was rude behaviour, 'shitty' behaviour. Maybe I am old, but replying to a social media comment, \"thank you for the wishes and gift\" when you've been sent such a personalised, thought-out gift from a seriously ill bedridden member of your bfs family is generally considered rude behaviour.\n\nIt kinda reads that you decided to use Elle message to vent out existing grudges you have against Elle. Instead of accepting that in this situation, Elle was right to call this out. Otherwise your Mum and sisters would have all silently assumed your gf is rude and ungrateful and it would have affected how they viewed her. Ideally at 25 & 29, you two shouldn't have needed a 19 yr old to remind you to send a private thank you message. But you didn't know, and there's no shame in not knowing, you made it right, which is what's important, and now you both know better for future. Why turn this into a massive feud? Why refuse to be around Elle, because you personally wouldn't have used the words 'rude' or 'shitty'? Elle didn't say your gf is rude and shitty, she said the behaviour was. Elle is 19, so choosing to match her level of maturity at 25 & 29 is certainly an interesting choice. Thank you cards go along way with building a great relationship with in-laws fyi. Gently YTA accept the L in this situation, move on.", "ESH. Your GF definitely could have made more of an effort to say thanks. A FB comment just feels so cold and lazy to me. Your sister was right to call her out, but was too aggressive about it. You and GF are additionally TA for forcing people to pick sides over this when all your sister did was call your GF out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your gf also is rude and lack etiquette. Your sick mom managed to coordinate buying and sending sending a gift for your gf involving your sister. Least she can do is call her with a thank you not responding to a Fb message. YTA for ill- mannered. Your gf lucky enough your mother and sister spent time buying and sending a gift for her bday. Tell your chick to apologize and write a proper thank you note.", "ESH. Your girlfriend is rude and haa shit manners, you're weaponising family against your sister,  and your sister was also rude.  Honestly, though, I think I would have been as well if someone was that thoughtless to my mum when she was ill and still made an effort to come through on a gift.", "NTA. Ellie could have approached it differently. \u201cHay, OP, GF is usually so great at thank yous and will mom in bed we provably missed it!\u201d", "YTA for missing family events and punishing your Nan. \n\nYou're all so dramatic, especially your GF. This whole situation is honestly pathetic in its sheer pettiness.\n\nETA Actually, you know something? If your Nan has grandchildren missing on her birthday thanks to your stupidity, I hope her kids never forgive you", "NTA, the fact your family is on your side shows you're not the only one getting sick of your sister BS. Let her be uninvited, she might grow up that way", "ESH. I agree with Elle your gf could have thanked your mom more than a Facebook comment..: but it wasn\u2019t her place to confront her about it and be rude. That being said, you and your gf are much older, and this really seems to have been blown out of proportion by you two. It is gross that you are leveraging the family against your sister and weaponizing not attending events to get them to go along with you. You and gf should \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d it really isn\u2019t that deep", "YTA Elle should have phrased the thing better, she should apologize for how she talked to your gf. But your gf was wrong, she was rude and shitty, and she has to reply in a more formal way.\nYou and your gf are overreacting, stop seeing your family just because this is really childish.", "NTA.  Elle sounds like a real shit.  Like, even if your gf didn't say thank you directly to your mom, why did Elle get all up in your grill about that?", "I am always confused by the people espousing \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d in situations where someone is clearly taking advantage of that exact stance to be a complete idiot! It is nonsensical to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome. This lacklustre attitude is why you have so many idiots who are pikachu shocked when they get their comeuppance from the attitude they portray because everyone in the social circles give them no consequences for their actions or behaviours!", "NTA between collateral damaging your family or letting down your gf you have made a choice. The correct choice in my opinion. Enabling insufferable people like Elle is a terrible idea. You should consider embracing the idea of excluding Elle from family events instead.", "NTA what's up with a message saying hey mums a lil upset that she didn't get a thanks from gf for the birthday gift do you think she could just send her a quick message? Instead of the nuclear option", "NTA with a caveat\n\nThe problem is still ongoing bc your sister doesn't know how to differentiate \"the behaviour vs the person\".\n\nWhile your GF's initial behaviour might have been perceived as rude, for not thanking your mum directly, you brought it to her attention and the matter was addressed. End of story.\n\nHowever, Ellie criticized her as a person, and after being called out for it, she doubled down and said it was your fault your GF was made aware of her rant, but at the same time she didn't take back the slightest bit of her words.\n\nAt this point, it's Ellie's personality that's coming across as \"rude and sh\\*\\*y\", as it shows to be recurrent. Your GF does not need to put up with it, but I think shutting down all contact with the rest of the family because of one person is a bit of an exaggeration.\n\nYour family - at least the members still living in the household - should address Ellie's lack of accountability for things said and done, and establish boundaries that would allow things to resume a normal pace later.\n\nFor the mean time, maybe you can attend the family events but not engage in any kind of conversation with Ellie, or acknowledge her until she apologizes.", "ESH - Your sister was out of line for the way she approached the situation. Your gf should have sent a personal thank you. You are choosing to miss out of family events likely harming those relationships, even if your family agrees with you. \n\n\nThe fact that this was a few months ago and you and your GF are still choosing to isolate yourselves from everyone and not communicate with your sister is troubling. As someone with similar age gaps with my siblings, and dealt with similar situations, you\u2019re the adult in the situation. Your last sentence honestly sounds like you\u2019re trying to really drive in the knife and prove your point. Give your sister a bit of grace and space to grow up, be a role model to her rather than the big brother that \u201cwon\u2019t talk to her b/c he cares about his gf more than family\u201d. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to destroy a sibling relationship over something that in the long run is actually not a huge deal.", "We've said that anything we'd usually attend as a couple we'll take a pass on, but will spend time with people separately to celebrate it. As an example, for my Nan's birthday we're not going to the meal but are having her to stay and will spend a couple days in our city with her instead.\n\nI agree it's petty, but in my eyes it's between my GF & sister and I'm forced to pick a side. I'd rather we go to family events as normal and just ignore Elle.", "This ^", "the fact they\u2019re contemplating uninviting a 19 year old from events at the home she lives at, to accommodate the petty grudge of the 25 year old gf\u2026", "Then you\u2019re on the right track, but you can\u2019t feel bad if your family wants to see you and your GF, but have to kick Elle out to accommodate it.", ">anything we\u2019d usually attend as a couple we\u2019ll take a pass on, but will spend time with people separately to celebrate it\n\nLet me give it to you straight, this shit gets old real fast for the rest of the family. We had a similar incident in my fam where Bro/SIL and mother/mothers partner were not talking over some equally petty bs. The rest of the fam could not give a shit. We didn\u2019t want to have two birthdays or whatever because a small few couldn\u2019t just be at the same place and behave civilly. You\u2019re spreading the burden to everyone else to have to make additional time to accomodate more catch-ups with you because you and your GF (who are grown adults) don\u2019t want to see one person. My Brother and SIL ended up completely segregated from the family for about 2 years because of it and had no one to blame but themselves. \n\nI don\u2019t know if there is really more to it than what you wrote but based on the post this is a totally ludicrous reason to make this much of a big deal over. Families have fights/disagreements. I really recommend to move on. GF doesn\u2019t need to talk to sister for a while if she doesn\u2019t want but turn up to the family events and talk to everyone else.", "YTA. Your GF is old enough to have decent manners and call/text someone as a thank you *for a personalized gift.* She made a mistake, and it\u2019s not the biggest deal in the world. But now she, and by extension you, are continuing to hold a grudge about being called out for said mistake. \n\nI mean, you\u2019re 29, your GF is 25, and Elle is 19. Act your age my friend."]}
