This is a whole adult man expecting his wife to play alarm clock while she\u2019s already dealing with the kids. This is a pattern of behaviour and sets a terrible example for the children, too, who will remember daddy sleeping in until 11am every weekend and every Christmas while mom is up every morning doing all the things. Parents don\u2019t have the luxury of sleeping in. He should be upset with himself. And should be apologizing to you. NTA.", "ESH. My husband and son and I always talk the night before about what time we\u2019re getting up to open presents. They set alarms because otherwise they\u2019d be sleeping late, too. I wake them up a little bit before the alarm and we all open presents together. It\u2019s an incredibly special time of family togetherness. I couldn\u2019t imagine us opening presents with someone missing.  If I was your husband, I\u2019d be hurt, too. And I understand the frustration of being with someone who takes a while to wake up in the morning.

How ridiculous of him to expect someone else to wake him. If he wants to be part of family events he can get his own ass out of bed, or at least set expectations ahead of time. \n\nDid he ask you to wake him up?

Ultimately, it's his responsibility; that said, I don't believe that you simply were carried away by the momentum of things and didn't even notice that he wasn't there until it was too late -- I kind of suspect that at some level you are sick of waking him up and thought that this served him right. If he couldn't be bothered to get himself up on Christmas morning he deserved to miss out. Am I right?", "YTA and I\u2019m cringing so hard right now waiting for the men to brigade because of the recent post where the husband didn\u2019t wake the wife for her 15?

He is purposely choosing to miss these key moments. I'd like him to read what I write next.\n\nMy husband passed away from brain cancer mid January of this year. On Christmas morning 3 weeks earlier he managed to get out of bed, into his wheelchair and was by the tree to watch our 2 kids open up their presents. What's your husband's excuse to not being there? This Christmas, not having their dad there was tough but all the little memories of him, like picking up the wrapping paper, lighting the fire, gently swearing about the impossibility of getting a toy out of it's packaging and more memories which to outsiders may seem mundane but to us are precious and let us smile after the tears. Your husband seems intent to create a memory legacy of not being there, and if he's okay with that be prepared for fallout later in your kids lives.\nNTA", "NTA. He apologized because he knows he's the one who f***ed it. Time to have a calm conversation about his weekend routine, and just tell him you respect his need to more sleep/quiet & slow mornings, so you won't be waking him up.\n\n But that you expect him to wake up on time for any morning events during weekends, same as he does for work, unless you've agreed on a different split of tasks previously", "NTA. I'm so tired of grown ass men expecting their wife to be their mpm. Him sleeping in till 11am on the weekend while you have two kids is also wild to me.", "You allowed your kids to open gifts while one parent was sleeping? Yeah, ESH. Do you or the children even like your husband?", "NTA he\u2019s a grown adult. He missed it because he didn\u2019t set his alarm. He didn\u2019t set his alarm because it wasn\u2019t really that important to him- as demonstrated by past Christmases", "ESH.\n\nI can't fathom not waking my husband up or not making my kids wait until both parents are up. Seeing the joy on people's faces as they open gifts is the best part of giving gifts.\n\n\nOtoh, he sucks for choosing to sleep in when he knows it's Christmas.", "Well let's see if the situation were reversed and he hadn't woken you up would you think he were an AH? If the answer's yes you have your answer as to whether you're an AH.\n\nChristmas is not a normal weekend and most parents want to watch their children's excitement on Christmas morning.  Also why did you not tell your children to wait, you make it sound like you have no control.\n\nAlso your husband knows what day is happening when he goes to bed, why didn't he set an alarm.\n\nESH but you moreso.", "NTA. The only saving grace is that he blamed himself. He should do. OK, he might be tired, he might work hard during the week, but on Christmas day he can darn well get up. Or miss out... Communication could be better, this could have been sorted out, but in the end without communicating a different plan, then he should have gotten up.", "ESH. He needs to grow up, set his alarm, and stop using you for an alarm clock. And you both need to teach your kids some self-restraint and to stop \"tearing into things\" before everyone is awake.", "Nta", "YTA\n\nYou went and woke up the kids, but you didn't bother to wake up your husband?\n\nIf there is ONE DAY of the year you should bother waking up your partner, it's on Xmas morning. \n\nIt comes off as intentional and spiteful, like you wanted him to miss out on it to send him a message or exclude him from this to have the moment all for yourself.", "YTA watching kids open their presents is the best bit of christmas. You need to make sure your kids know they can't open presents until everyone is gathered - you decide who \"everyone\" is. ever since my kids were little the rules were 1. no earlier than 9am and 2. once both parents and any one else who was staying for Christmas was up and ready.", "Why do your kids think it's OK to just start tearing into gifts? My 4 year old knows he needs to wait until we're all there.  \n\nI've never known a family that started opening gifts before everyone is there... bribing daddy with coffee is a staple in our house. \"DADDY! I brought you coffee! Wake up! It's time to open presents!\" It's just part of the excitement... nobody sets an alarm for Christmas.  The kids are the alarm. \n\nYou clearly have other issues in your relationship, but you 100% should have stopped your children from opening gifts until the people who bought those gifts and love those kids were there to watch and help.  It doesn't seem reasonable that you just forgot about it and got carried away.  It seems more like you were trying to teach him a lesson, and Christmas isn't the day to do that.  \n\nYTA", "ESH. \n\nYTA for not waking him, he\u2019s TA for sleeping in/not asking you to wake him. \n\nThe good news is he apologized, but you should too if you haven\u2019t already.", "Why did he not set an alarm (or several) to wake himself at a reasonable time? It\u2019s a holiday, and it\u2019s immensely important to the children. If it was important to him he should have made sure he would be there. It should not be your responsibility to ensure he is awake, while also dealing with breakfast, and rambunctious kids with the last thing they want to do being waiting to open their gifts. If it was three or four in the morning that would be a different story\u2014but it was 9:30am.\n\nThat said, it wouldn\u2019t have been hard to grab the kids and excitedly say, \u201clet\u2019s go get dad so we can open presents!\u201d This feels like a grey area, because it seems like you have been frustrated with having to wake him for a long while, and ended up punishing him for not handling his own responsibilities in that regard\u2014but Christmas day was not the day to do it, whether it was intentional or not. Although, I have an incredibly hard time believing you genuinely forgot to wake him, and didn\u2019t notice their father wasn\u2019t there. The fact the kids didn\u2019t notice or care (unless they did and it\u2019s just not mentioned) is a whole other problem in itself, and without more information it\u2019s not possible to say whether it\u2019s his behavior, or your combined parenting that\u2019s the issue. Then there\u2019s also _this_:\n\n>Previous years, I\u2019ve woken him at the same time as the kids have gotten up and he continued to sleep anyway so I didn\u2019t think this year was any different.\n\nThat\u2019s a valid assumption, but it\u2019s also being used as an excuse for not even trying. It\u2019s safe to say since you\u2019ve _always_ woken him prior he assumed you would do so this time as well. A conversation should have been had before Christmas day if you did not want to wake him. This whole thing is a bit of a mess with everyone exhibiting some minor selfish behavior.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that he missed this part of the holiday. It\u2019s okay for him to be upset about that, especially considering everyone essentially forgot he existed. On a time intended to celebrate the love, bond, and kindness of family, he was left alone, only to finally be woken and find out he missed the most lovely parts and getting to see the joy on his kids faces. In a sense he may have felt like he got stabbed in the back, since he likely purchased some of those presents\u2014and again, you\u2019ve always woken him before. _He had no reason to think it would be any different this time around_. He also did take accountability for not handling it himself, apologized to you, and explained he was just disappointed.\n\nDid everyone stay and watch him open his gifts once he was awake to make sure he was included? Did anyone apologize to him for not waking him up, and not realizing he wasn\u2019t there? Did anyone thank him for what he got them? Did _he_ apologize for not being there, and let his children know he had meant to be? Did he also apologize to you for expecting you to wake him? Is he doing anything or making a plan to ensure this won\u2019t happen again? To me this is a solid ESH. \n\n>On Christmas morning the kids got up around 9:30\n\nAlso, I need to point out you guys are _lucky_. He has been in a wonderful position for many years being able to sleep in so late. Everyone I\u2019ve known personally throughout life normally gets up between 5-7am to open presents, and if someone isn\u2019t awake they get promptly dragged out of bed. I woke everyone up this year at 4am.\n\nEdit to add: I see now that in comments you mention _you woke the children_, but didn\u2019t wake him. That almost puts this into Y T A territory, especially since you\u2019ve left important information out of the post to make yourself look better.", "If he is just lazy then NTA. If he works hard YTA. You both only get so many of these mornings.", "Mine pulls this crap. All that time he spends laying there on his phone, surely he can figure out how to set an alarm to wake his own self up. NTA", "NTA - He is the one missing out on his children\u2019s lives not you. *He WILL regret this* when they get older, I promise. Our sons are 35 and 33 with wives and children of their own. My husband *knows* all he missed out on especially now watching his sons with his grandchildren. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: You CANNOT fix this. You will be looked at like a \u201cnagging wife\u201d. He has to learn the hard way, on his own.", "NTA. \n\nThis sub has made me realise how little all of your husbands care for you and how I'm so glad I'm a lesbian.", "YTA - on Christmas morning no presents should be opened until everyone is there. It's just common courtesy. An alarm wouldn't work in my house cause kids were up earlier than usual, I'm a much lighter sleeper so was up and of course would wake up my husband cause I'm not a jerk.", "You're both in the wrong if I'm honest. \n\nI wouldn't dream of opening the presents without the whole family present, but equally it isn't right to sleep in so much and let you do all the childrearing. He is more TA for that, unless you get the time back that is. Some parents I know will take turns laying in etc. I think a wider discussion should be had. \n\nAlso, where's the communication? Me and my partner naturally coordinate things like this. We will discuss the night before when to set our alarm etc. We set it for 9.30 on Christmas day as a decision we made together.", "YTA because you just let the kids tear into everything. Did you not tell them they had to wait until their dad was awake? Then you don't have to do anything. They'll wake him up. Part of Christmas morning for kids is about impulse control, tbh.", "NTA. The phrase \"if he wanted to, he would\" really rings true on this one. I can't imagine that gift unwrapping was a quiet affair, and he has slept through all of the other Christmases. If I'm being generous, maybe he should get checked out for sleep apnea. In general, though, you need to discuss with him that his anger at himself should *not* be taken out on you and he needs to figure out better ways to deal with his mistakes and related feelings. You shouldn't feel bad, because this was entirely his responsibility. He didn't set alarms, he didn't even ask you to wake him up.", "NTA. He apologised, so he knows he's in the wrong. The way you describe it isn't like it's a new thing either, sounds like he's missed every other Christmas morning too because he couldn't be bothered to get up. If in previous years you've woken him up and he's missed it anyway, then why would you think about waking him up? Besides, he's an adult and can set an alarm. \n\nSounds like a pretty poor father", "YTA -  of course you\u2019re the asshole,  you don\u2019t open presents until everyone is there and of course you should know that.", "YTA.....  How can you sit here and claim that waking up dad \"slipped your mind\" on Christmas morning.... WTF", "YTA considering the gifts are from both of you, and he should have been given the opportunity. How hard is it to tell your kids to wait a minute while you go wake up dad? \n\nIt's like there are no healthy boundaries or expectations in this situation. \n\nIf you were already awake and in the living room and then your kids all filed in (individually? all at once?) and they immediately went and opened presents then there's something wrong with that. If they asked you and you said *go ahead* then there's something wrong with THAT. There's no respect in your family. It's only your husband's fault if you tried to wake him up this time and he did not get up.", "My former husband was like that. I was supposed to wake him up, and then he'd go back to sleep -- and then blame me when he didn't wake up in time.\n\nOne of many reasons he's my former husband.", "YTA. Address your husband\u2019s shitty sleeping habits the day after Christmas. Don\u2019t let him miss the kids opening presents. \n\nI mean why didn\u2019t you send the kids in to wake up their dad before presents? My dad was the early morning parent as a kid on weekends so on holidays and stuff he\u2019d either wake up my mom or send us in to wake her after it was late enough in the morning.", "NTA. Your hubs already accepted it's his own fault, so I think that tells me everything I need to know.", "YTA. Not so much because you didn\u2019t wake him up, but because you let the kids open their stuff without him. How would you have felt if he had allowed them to open stuff when you were not there?\nHe may well annoy you by sleeping in, but the issue is you chose to let the kids open the gifts.", "NTA - as others have said, just for the fact that he would have known it was Christmas and the kids would be up and excited to open their gifts. What kind of parent sleeps in through that and isn\u2019t up and ready to go with the kids? Not sure why it\u2019s the mother\u2019s responsibility to carry the mental load of Christmas to the point she has to LITERALLY WAKE UP A GROWN ASS MAN.", "[removed]", "I'm surprised by all the comments. \n\nYes. YTA. Times 100. Your children only have so many childhood holidays. Yeah he traditionally sleeps through, but you didn't even give him the chance. Providing you sleep in the same space I'm wondering if the kids woke you? If so, why not give him a shake?\n\nYou got all the way through the entirety of Christmas morning before even acknowledging his absence at all. Either there is more to your marriage that I'm missing or you are a horrible wife. Sleeping late doesn't make you a bad husband but intentionally leaving him out of a huge childhood memory makes you an awful wife.\n\nYTA. YTA. YTA.", "NAH, I don\u2019t think anyone is TA here, just emotions running high, & perhaps there could be more communication so that expectations are clearer going forward.\n\nHe was upset that he missed it, which is understandable, & it seems he mostly blamed himself, & then apologised for earlier. You didn\u2019t realise he\u2019d want to be woken & you were busy minding the kids.\n\nMaybe you could talk about plans for next year, to make sure that going forward you are on the same page? Might it be worth changing the routine a bit, especially if your husband is tired from working late? Some families will have a tradition where the kids open one present in the morning, & then open the rest a little later after breakfast, & that could make it easier for your husband to be there with them?\n\nEither way, I don\u2019t see any As here, just busy parents trying to make it work, & sometimes that takes a bit of finagling to make everything fit. Keep communicating with each other. You\u2019ve got this.", "ESH. There are so many better ways to handle this and neither of you did anything. I seriously could list dozens of ways this could have been resolved better. But ultimately, you both should have communicated a plan. When will presents be? Will there be food before or after? How will we wake up, etc. \n\nSo yea, sounds like you guys really need to work on communicating better.", "Esh.  Reign your kids in.  They can wait unail you two are up to open presents.  My son always had to wait until we were up and he couldn\u2019t wake us up until 7am.  You are by far the bigger asshole as it\u2019s obvious you decided to make a point in Christmas Day about your husband sleeping in on weekends.", "NTA, your husband knew the kids would be up early the next morning to open presents. He could have set an alarm or at least asked you, like what a normal adult would do. If it was important to him, he would have been there.", "Did he know the kids would wake up at 9:30 or did they wake up without an alarm? My kid usually wakes up naturally (and early) on Christmas. She then comes and wakes us up if we aren\u2019t already awake with her. If you have a similar setup, then I\u2019d think you were the AH, but if you all knew what time the kids would be up, he\u2019s a grown man and can wake himself up.", "I can't remember when I was a kid my parents making us wait till everybody was up and until the grandparents got there. Sometimes we had to wait until 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning. Sometimes we had to wait until like 1:00 p.m.. guess what? That never once ruined Christmas. You knew what you were doing. Stop being passive aggressive and use your grown up words and adult voice to talk with your husband about why you I'm mad at him instead of coming on Reddit to try to get people on your side with one side of story", "NTA- there\u2019s a reason why terms like Married Single Mom and Mental Load exist.

It's not your responsibility to raise your husband, his parents should have already done that.", "NTA.  But you should have your kids go wake him.  Tell them to be persistent to make him get up because they can't open any presents until he is out of bed.  He may ignore you waking him, but it is doubtful that he'll ignore his kids.

Surely the mind immediately goes to the joy of being there to see the kids open their presents, which sparks the thought of sharing those moments with her husband -- or thinking \"this time he has to pay for his careless sleeping in.\"", "Honestly it's an ESH from me, but I wholly empathize with OP; on Christmas of all days, when you want everything to go well, he's being selfish and not taking care of what he needs to. OP needs to own the fact that it was the last straw, instead of framing it as a \"mistake\".", "Or the husband could have set a damn alarm since he knew he was gonna sleep in", "Only sane take", "It's not her responsibility but obviously it's incredibly rude and hurtful for one parent to give the go ahead to the kids without the other there to share the moment. \n\nThey're both dumb for not discussing their plans for Xmas day, but it's not JUST about her waking him up, is it?", "Busy helping her kids open presents.", "Telling the kids to hold off on tearing the presents open until dad wakes up?  Looks like she forgot to do that part too.", "It's so much worse. She later said that SHE WOKE THE CHILDREN. The kids were still sleeping.", "True but there is no universal set time to open Christmas presents. Either the kids wait until Dad awakens by himself or someone goes in to wake him earlier. It\u2019s harsh to expect him to set an alarm clock for an unspecified time. Plenty of us open presents in the afternoon. Christmas morning is not the only way to do it.", "That\u2019s an opinion.", "That doesn't make OP TA though... he's ultimately an adult and responsible for waking himself up. It would have been nice for OP to do that, but in the chaos of Christmas morning it's also understandable that she didn't and not her fault if he doesn't wake himself up.", "Obviously. \n\nSo dad should stay in bed on Xmas and they should open later? Is that your thought? Even if they aren't opening gifts straight away, it would be nice to be together rather than dad in bed while mum wrangles the kids on Xmas. Especially as the kids didn't get up until 9.30. he's had a 4.5hr lay in by that point by most people's standards.", "I\u2019ve an old Victorian house with steep stairs and a basement. Generally, not a good idea for young children to be roaming around in the dark during the night. \n\nI\u2019m surprised that\u2019s so controversial - but each to their own. The kids had a great Christmas without anyone being maimed or incapacitated - which I\u2019m counting a win :)", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s used to getting up in the morning, and we all know children can get up anywhere between\u2026 oh, let\u2019s say 5am and 10.30am.\n\nIf he\u2019d set an alarm for 10, he\u2019d have still missed everything. If the children got up earlier than the alarm (not that he set one!) he would have been reasonable hoping for his loving spouse to attempt to wake him up or stall the kids. A lack of alarm is part of why ESH, but it isn\u2019t the whole answer.\n\nOf course, I do think there\u2019s a little bit missing here\u2026 if he usually does a late shift and gets in after midnight, it\u2019s not unreasonable for the bloke to expect a bit of help in aligning his day with his family\u2019s. Or if he has a chronic health condition and doesn\u2019t really sleep much at normal times.", "Same. In some years, I\u2019ve been the person waking everyone else up, in others, I\u2019ve been the one jumped on when asleep. In most families, everyone wants everyone to share a celebration. There might be some impatience, squealing and shouting in herding everyone together, but there\u2019s generally herding!", "Yup! I agree he is a grown-ass man, but I'm saying it wouldn't have hurt for her to wake him up. This isn't her friend it's her husband, so the not one-another-keeper part doesn't make sense when it comes to not wanting your partner to miss out on moments and holding them accountable / making changes if there is an issue in a marriage. Why be married then? Regardless, the same situation happened two days ago and the gender was reversed. If the husband can be labelled YTA then OP should be as well.", "I think she planned it\n\nWhy let them open a few?", "Why does that have a bearing on whether or not she should have woken up her husband?", "Because he didn't live in the southern hemisphere?  \ud83d\ude04 We had a specific time (I think 6.30am) before we were allowed to annoy our parents. If they'd gone with sunrise, we'd have been out of bed at 4:30ish! But yeah, Christmas morning with excited kids is brutal,  especially if you've been up till all hours organising the 'magic'.", "We had stockings outside our doors with a dozen tiny things all individually wrapped (like a single pen would be wrapped), the idea being it would keep us occupied for an hour or so. To be fair, it worked!", "Ha! I have tried to have this rule lol never works though .  4:30 am was the earliest one year but he got sent back to bed for at least an hour lol", "My 2 year old grandson was able to wait through dinner Christmas Eve to open presents. It is part of the excitement.", "Um yes. It's called impulse control. And it seems she didn't even try to wake hubs up, just let the kids tear into gifts.", "Cathy Newman, is that you? \n\nDad can be told off about his behaviour. Kids can at least attempt to wake up dad.\n\nDad's behaviour doesn't make it ok to open gifts without him.", "The type of person who has a history of not setting alarms and relying on his wife to wake him up, and then gets upset with her when he can\u2019t successfully adult? That\u2019s who needs to set an alarm.", "Exactly, we did stocking presents (small things) first thing then actual presents once everyone has arrived", "So he is an asshole all those other Christmases, but this Christmas he isn't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>a grown man doesn't need to depend on his wife to wake up if he wants to.\n\nIt's not about grown man vs wife. I am the early riser in my relationship and I always wake my partner up. If they choose to sleep past that then they're at fault. But the polite thing to do is to wake them and give them the option.", "He's literally never present, even when he's finally up he's on his phone. Why would she notice?", "This was my take completely. Like \u201coh no, before I knew it everything was open! I feel so bad!\u201d\n\n\n*What?*", "It is so common for kids to wake parents up for Christmas that it\u2019s a trope on television shows and movies.\n\nAny other day, any other commitment, hell, leave him behind on a vacation if he knew what time you were supposed to leave, that\u2019s fine. Do it, his ass knew better.\n\nBut it sounds like they just woke up whenever they woke up and didn\u2019t make sure he was awake. On Christmas. WTF?\n\nIf you let him sleep on purpose, do it and explain why and ask for judgement then. But \u201cI forgot he wasn\u2019t awake?\u201d What?", "Not just that if she was going to other family for Christmas she would have been organising that making sure they have everything they need getting herself ready getting kids fed", "That's a fact.", "My thought is that kids could learn to be patient. Also, there is always an option to go and wake dad up. \n\nI am not justifying dad's actions, he should be told off and need to fix his own behaviour. Doesn't make it ok to open gifts without him.", "I was the parent that had a long lie on Christmas do u know what I did before I went to bed I had a conversation about how many presents my kids could open before I got up because I knew my partner would be busy getting everything ready to go spend Christmas with family because I'm an adult and ye knownwhat she if my kids opened more than I'd asked him to let them open I'd never have taken that out on him because its Christmas it's about the kids and if k wanted to see them open the presents I should have got up earlier", "In my house Santa's gifts were never wrapped with more than just a tag with a name on it and those were the only things under the tree we were allowed to mess with until my parents woke up. I have the same deal with my kid and I'm amazed to say that it still works! But I am definitely stealing the stocking idea because she begs for it while we wait for the rest of the house to wake up.", "I read through OPs comments.\n\nSHE WOKE THE KIDS UP AND GOT THEM STARTED. THE KIDS DID NOT WAKE HER. OMFG this is so much worse than I thought.", "I don't condone his normal weekend morning behavior, but I'm not going to pretend that means he wouldn't even be missed on Christmas morning.", "It says previous years he was woken up and went back to sleep anyway", "K.", "I said everyone sucks which means I agree kids could wait, dad could wake up. Why are you arguing with me like you think I think something else?", "But you and your husband are in a partnership and communicate! I guess I just have a different perception of Christmas. I forget that some children are raised with Santa, the Grinch, elf on the shelf, etc. I still think at some point OP could have quickly gotten her husband once they began. At no point did she. I think that is thoughtless (yes her husband is a grown man), but again everyone else is different.", "But obviously no one has ever allowed him to miss gift giving before, or he wouldn\u2019t be pissed. \n\nAgain\u2026 if OP was like \u201cso I taught him a lesson because he never seemed to care,\u201d sure. \n\nBut \u201cI forgot he wasn\u2019t awake?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s either completely ridiculous or just a flat out lie."]}
