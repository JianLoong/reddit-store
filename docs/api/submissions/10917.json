She had told me she invited some of her own friends (all around my age.) I had met some of them before, except for a woman who we'll call Lisa. Lisa was very sweet, softspoken, and honestly didn't fit in with the rest of the vibe that we usual had whenever Shannon held a ladies night. Lisa was more of a listener and would only engage in our conversations by nodding her head or giggling. \n\nI tried to be open to Lisa and asked her some questions. Basic life stuff like \"Are you married? Any kids? Hobbies?\" and she revealed she wasn't married but had a young son from a previous relationship. She told me all about him, which I felt that Lisa and I were bonding. Until she brought up what she does for a living. \n\nShe told me how she's a social worker. Specifically, a social worker who specializes in mindfulness and positivity. That struck me weird so I began to ask her about it, and she explained how she utilizes gratitude in her practice to help her patients. I began to ask her if she was serious, because there are certain situations where people don't see the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" and I just found everything she was saying to be ridiculous. I told her that she must not be the best therapist if she's telling to patients to look through rose colored glasses. She grew offended and told me that she's the one with a masters degree and a private practice so she must be doing something right. Lisa stayed away from me the rest of the night and did not say goodbye to me when she left. \n\nWhen I got home I ended up Googling her practice and seeing the reviews people left. Most of them were good, but others just proved my point that her practice is completely ridiculous. I texted Shannon my findings and Shannon began to defend Lisa, saying that she's a very smart woman and has helped many people, and I shouldn't judge someone because I'm \"ignorant\" and can't keep my opinions to myself.

You are not ignorant for sharing your feelings. Your feelings come from a place of ignorance and you sharing them is what revealed to others that ignorance. \n\nTo be more specific, your ignorance stems from the fact that you cannot fathom that some patients might find that type of therapy to be exactly what they need.

No. It might not be the right approach for some people, but here\u2019s the thing:\nPracticing gratitude isn\u2019t going to make everything sunshine and rainbows and lollipops. It doesn\u2019t take away from problems, what it does do is help people shift perspective, just a tiny bit. Small shifts everyday can have a lot of term benefits- one being to help build emotional resilience.

A short conversation doesn\u2019t give you the context to properly understand the depth of this, especially when she is a trained professional with literally years of training and you are not even close to that.\n\nTo top it off, you didn\u2019t let it go. You then went home to seek justification, then called and bad-mouthed her to your mutual friend. That was completely uncalled for, and a jerk move.\n\nAs for the unfavorable reviews, no counselor, social worker, or therapist is going to be the right fit for every person.

She might be exactly the kind of practitioner you need to improve YOUR fixed mindset.", "YTA. Of course she didn\u2019t say goodbye to you. You criticized her career and insulted her by saying she must not be good at her job??\n\nSocial work often has components of mindfulness training because it\u2019s a job that requires a lot of empathy.

If that type of therapy is not your cup of tea that's fine but there was no need to be so nasty and condescending.

No one single kind of therapy works for everyone. No one therapist is capable of helping everyone. Every single doctor or therapist has patients that they can't help, just like no one retailer can sell every product, and no one company can appease every customer.

Some people need to try different methods of therapy and find what works for them. Her approach may be bad for some and good for others but that\u2019s between patient and client and not for you to put your little nose all up into. She was quiet and reserved and polite and tried to come out of her shell and you just stepped on her like some know it all. That\u2019s very rude.

You are a bully.", "YYA\n\nJust because her approach does not work for you does not mean it won't work for others.

Accusing someone of doing their job wrong when you *just* met them is so aggressive and weird.", "Even if she has the most ridiculous job in the world you were extremely rude to someone you just met. And you then went out of your way to tell your mutual friend . YTA", "YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re upset that you offended someone, so you tried to prove that you\u2019re right to justify offending them?", "Omg, YTA. If I were them, I would never invite you to ladies night again. YIKES.", "YTA - she\u2019s a professional women making an honest living helping others. What\u2019s your problem? Women have a hard enough time without out women trying to tear them down. You should apologise immediately.", "YTA..\n\n\nThis is giving off \"My friend can only be my friend\" vibes. OP seems jealous of Lisa and wanted to prove to Shannon that she is better than Lisa. It's so weird for a woman in her 30s.\n\n\nIf you knew anything about therapy, you would know that the therapist can have different approaches. It can take a person several attempts before they find a person who clicks with them.", "YTA. It's crazy how some people cannot bear when someone is quiet and soft spoken. They immediately think something is wrong about them and have this irrational need to start stirring shit.", "YTA", "YTA. You owe \u201cLisa\u201d and your friends an apology.", "yeah yta and you don't know what mindfulness or positive psych is clearly", "YTA\n\nWhy did you feel the need to make sure that she knew how you felt about her job?  What does that achieve?\n\nWhat you should\u2019ve done was *asked* her if she\u2019s encountered situations where her approach doesn\u2019t work. Or just changed the subject. \n\nYou were rude to Lisa. And then you tried to drag Shannon into your manufactured drama. You owe both of them an apology.", "YTA, you decided right away she 'didn't fit in' then you grill her until she shares her career and then you decide to be the biggest asshole you can muster!?!\n\nYou aren't some expert and certainly have no idea what her job looks like day to day. You're a judgemental AH who insulted a person just because you think you're smarter or something. Going home to Google her in order to convince yourself that you were right is incredibly gross and shallow behavior!\n\nShame on you!", "YTA and a bully", "Hey Regina George, this isn\u2019t high school. Get off your high horse!", "YTA and why are you so obsessed with her that you Googled her reviews? Weird.", "YTA, doesn't matter if she gets gets paid to dilate her eyes. None of ya business to judge.", "YTA, insecure maybe?", "YTA. And rude, and yes ignorant. Lisa\u2019s right. You\u2019re not the one with an advanced degree and practicing in her field. She knows far more than you do about treating her patients. A few bad reviews means NOTHING here. Therapy is a very personal thing. Not every therapist is a good fit for everyone. You seem far too focused on these reviews as some sort of gotcha (again- proving you ARE ignorant in the subject) that you conveniently ignore the good ones. You\u2019re a bully and shouldn\u2019t be surprised if Shannon cuts you from these events.", "YTA, you\u2019re also a bully, and probably should seek some counseling yourself.", "I'm so confused what your point was....you attacked her and then Googled her...did you think she'd go oh yes you're right my whole life's work has been wrong. \n\nYTA", "YTA. She gave a quick summary of her work to a stranger at a party, and on that basis you decided you\u2019re in a position to judge?\n\nWe\u2019ve all caught on that it\u2019s shitty and arrogant when men mansplain to women. You did the same thing here - presumed that your hot take is equivalent to someone else\u2019s actual experience and knowledge.\n\nNot every kind of therapy is a fit for everyone. So if you talk to some therapist, and all you hear is bullshit, then maybe they\u2019re a terrible therapist. But maybe they\u2019re just a bad fit for you and your personality. There\u2019s plenty of evidence for mindfulness and positive psychology, and lots of people find it effective.", "YTA. MYOB.", "YTA and also wtf. You\u2019re very insecure, work on it.", "YTA.", "YTA. You insulted her to her face. Got home and did research to see if your insults were accurate. Found some bad reviews. Immediately texted Shannon/Sharon what bs you dug up on Lisa to prove you were right with your Assholeness. You are a shitty friend. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole group drops you as a friend. They definitely won't let you meet anybody new again.", "YTA and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if you don\u2019t get invited to ladies night for awhile after this. You bullied her and then tried to get your mutual friend to joint in? Yeah def YTA here.", "YTA For degrading some ones job just because just didn't care for what she does. You insulted her for no reason when you had just met her. Yes very much YTA", "YTA. I don't understand what people like you get out of bringing other people down. Did something bad happen? Maybe you should see someone to help you see the light at the end of the tunnel?", "[removed]", "It sounds like she went through all the reviews to find like one negative one to justify her \u201cpoint\u201d", "YTA 100%  If she has a viable private practice with any good reviews then she's obviously helped some of her clients. \n\nIn the meantime, OP is out here as a mean girl at 35 which isn't cute and is frankly embarrassing. Not sure why OP felt the need to tear someone she just met down to make herself feel better/important/successful, but it reeks of jealousy and feeling threatened by someone who seems to have made a good life for herself. OP should probably find  a therapist with similarly good reviews to Lisa to help her address the issues that brought her to the point that she would think this is socially acceptable or productive behavior.", "Exactly! Those bad reviews could of been left by people who don\u2019t see what the harm they are causing themselves or don\u2019t want to make an effort in growing and changing as a person.", "I\u2019ve had nothing but amazing experiences with my psychiatrist office. I was looking up their phone number and saw their reviews. They had like two stars and several negative reviews but very few positive ones. People don\u2019t usually go online to rave about their doctors or social workers, but they sure as hell will when they feel slighted or insulted. I put very little stock in reviews of professional places or people like this.", "That\u2019s what gets me!  What was the end goal here????", ">Seeing the world only through your perspective is textbook ignorance.\n\nLove this", "It would have made more sense to Google mindfulness and gratitude as a therapeutic tool. Reviews tend to be from people who have a complaint-valid or not-and people who are happy with their therapist likely wouldn't even look at reviews, much less seek to write one.\n\nOP didn't give enough credence to a master's level, licensed clinical social worker to consider looking at what the therapy she practices is. But, OP just wanted to slam the woman and wanted to prove herself *right* with these reviews. OP seems to have no aptitude for critical thinking.", "Yes, how dare Lisa [checks notes] be sweet, soft-spoken and a good listener? Particularly on her very first occasion of being introduced to her friend\u2019s loud social circle that apparently contains at least one super judgmental Judy? \n\nDamn, imagine if Lisa had revealed something that was actually sensitive or subject to judgment? What a fun social occasion for a working single mother to enjoy. Are OP\u2019s friends secretly like the bored housewives on 30 Rock who started a fight club just to feel something?\n\nSounds like Lisa was getting a feel for the room and trying to make sure that she didn\u2019t overdo it or step on any toes while making a first impression. If I were Shannon, I know whose \u201cvibe\u201d I would prefer to invite to my next party, and it ain\u2019t OP.", "Social worker here. I agree with everything in this comment. YTA", "While claiming to be 35 years old\n\nYTA", "She might not even be shy. Social workers, generally, are good at listening and are interested in listening. And since this was her first time with the group, she may have been reading the room before contributing.", "Is pirate an option...? I feel like I missed my calling...", "It\u2019s absolutely a completely normal job, agreed, and I wish so much that I ended up at parties talking to people who are pet psychics or whatever, it sounds really entertaining. Even then I\u2019d save the shade of \u201cI met an actual pet psychic at a party tonight\u201d for a private text message with my BFF after I got home. \n\nEven if somebody says something you genuinely find appalling, like \u201cI\u2019m a fundraiser for [hateful special interest group]\u201d or whatever, wouldn\u2019t you just\u2026 change the subject and then discreetly escape when you got the chance? I am baffled by OP\u2019s choices here.", "This is what I was looking to say. YTA, I don\u2019t see where Lisa said her kind of therapeutic approach was the only therapeutic approach. She said she specializes in mindfulness, therefore if people want to seek her out that is their business. Any given person in therapy is at a different point of their journey, and responds differently to different modes of therapy, nobody is right or wrong, you just find what works for you specifically. \n\nSeeking out online reviews to prove your point what a huge AH move, what exactly did you have to prove in that moment? Using it to contact Shannon? Also huge AH move. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you aren\u2019t asked to any more gatherings.", "Exactly! Mindfulness and gratitude as part of psychotherapy is evidenced-based practice. The OP is a massive ignorant AH.", "She also doesn't seem to understand at all what Lisa actually does. It's like saying \"what do you do for a living?\" - \"I'm head chef in a restaurant\" - \"well, eating head is disgusting, you must be a terrible chef!\".", "THIS!\n\nMindfulness isn't about seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, it's about learning to be present in the moment so you can see the issue more objectively.", "Bro stop commenting this on every post, YTA", "I\u2019m betting Lisa\u2019s ratio of good to bad reviews looks a lot better than the NTA to YTA ratio on this post.", "Some people can give negative reviews due to some minor things such as mask policies.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be suprised if some of them were relatives of people coming to her", "I don't care whether \"Lisa\" was an astrologer or a fortune teller or an MLM salesperson (and believe me, I have no love for any of that con artistry). Unless she's pushing her ideas and views on the group (which OP clearly explained that she was NOT), there is absolutely no reason to challenge her profession in a social setting. NONE. It becomes a problem if and only if she tries to hustle members of the group with some kind of grift. \n\nThe sole purpose in attacking \"Lisa\" over her profession was to try and bring her down in front of the other friends. And people who do that should be exposed for the assholes they are.", "Move to Somalia", "I hope that they don't invite her again. I can't imagine she's any fun to be around if she's this much of an AH.", "I completely agree! It seems OP has some deep-seated issues that drive her to randomly belittle someone she's just met. It's something I can't fathom outside of some sort of pathology. Maybe OP has fears about her own mental health and lashed out at someone who (she feared) might somehow recognize it in her. I could come up with a lot of different theories, but with OP clamming up and her clearly willful ignorance, we'll just never know!", "On second thought, maybe not."]}
