Unfortunately this is one of those situations where timing in life did not play out to treat you and your sibling with an exact equal result.

He can wait until he gets a job and and saves the money. You don't owe him anything. Your grandma died 2 years ago, after he'd been with his gf for 4 years, she had plenty of time to gift him something (like whatever she gave your mum and aunt) but chose not to.

Even if you don't see it as sentimental, your grandmother ***definitely*** did. You have no obligation to pay for your brother's ring just because you were gifted one. That's ridiculous to a T. He can go to the bank, make payment plans, etc if it's that important he gets one right away. Or, he can be an adult, and speak with his GF about this.

Life isn\u2019t fair. Sometime it is a matter of timing whether something works for one person but fails for another.  Grandma has a relationship with OP\u2019s then gf, this lead to her wanting to give her ring when they wanted to marry. OP\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t getting married or close to it, so why would Grandma think about \u201cfairness\u201d regarding gifting a ring.

The ring was given to you at a different time.  Those who are considering it an inheritance are just not right.  I have some jewelry from my grandmother given to me years before she passed.  That was separate from inheritance which was split evenly.  \n\nYour brother is being entitled (to your money). He needs to purchase a ring he can afford.  I think there is more to his ring story than he is telling you. Maybe he promised a ring greater than he can afford. Maybe he has been saying he has been saving for a ring for years. Maybe her family has certain expectations of what he can afford. Etc.", "NTA - if he can\u2019t pay he shouldn\u2019t propose simple as that.

His financial situation sucks, and it might have been okay if he had asked for a loan, with the intention of paying it back, but outright asking for the money and then insulting you and calling you selfish when you don't agree is incredibly rude.\n\nSurely there are places that have payment plans, so he doesn't have to give over a lot of money all at once.", "NTA - this is something he needs to buy his fiancee. \n\nIt isn\u2019t your job to pay for his since your grandmother gifted you her ring.", "NTA. If he can't afford a ring now, maybe he shouldn't propose until he can afford something.", "NTA, but I do see your brother's point.  You didn't have to start with that debt, and your grandmother could have just said, \"well, get what you can afford\" but she didn't.  It is wonderful that you have that beautiful story.  It is sad that there isn't a story like that for your brother.  Imagine how you would feel if he were gifted 10k.  You got nothing.  It just helps.  I am not saying you have to gift him 5k or 10k, but maybe talk to him and see what his thoughts were on what you could contribute?", "NAH. Unless your brother also got an inheritance worth 10k he's just asking if you'll make things fair. It's not a ridiculous question. \n\nIt's not your responsibility, though. If you're comfortable giving him a loan you can offer that, but any time you loan money to family you shouldn't expect to get it back.", "NTA. It is tacky to ask someone else to pay for an engagement ring. If they can't afford the real thing, make do with fake or without. The engagement is not all about the ring.", "NTA. Grandma helped you out when you were just getting started in life at 22. That was her gift to give. You don\u2019t owe your brother anything for grandma\u2019s gift. It\u2019s also a weird timing for your brother to decide to propose with a ring he can\u2019t afford right after being fired. Next he\u2019ll ask you to pay for the wedding because he got fired and you still have a job so you lucked out again.", ">I honestly thought that was ridiculous\n\nAnd you are correct. **NTA**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I personally think he should just pay for the ring he can afford and if she wants to at a later time in life upgrade it when their finances are better. \n\nAlso correct. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> i was telling my coworker about it, he said he understand Charlies point and that I did luck out.\n\nProblem solved! : Coworker can chip in! Maybe go halfsies?", "NTA.  I have major second hand embarrassment reading this post. Your brother is ridiculous.  I think it\u2019s disgusting when people feel that they are entitled to or owed an inheritance.  The audacity to ask you to help pay for an engagement right.  A grown man trying to eat off your family\u2019s plate?? How pathetic.  Your grandmother chose to give you her ring. That\u2019s the end of it.  You don\u2019t owe him shit.  He needs to get a job and save up to buy a ring.  Ya know like a grown ass man. What\u2019s next? Will he expect you to help pay for the wedding? Contribute the honeymoon?", "NTA. Your grandmother chose to gift one to you, that does not mean that you have to buy rings for others.", "NTA.\n\nYou were gifted the ring by your grandmother while she was alive, and she liked and approved of your then-fiancee.  None of that applies to your brother or his girlfriend, although I suppose they must have met.\n\nYes, you \"lucked out\" but in the end it is no different than if you won $10,000 in the lottery.  How much of that would your brother feel entitled to?", "NTA There is no law that states his girlfriend must be given a ring of equal vale to your wife\u2019s ring. His girlfriend doesn\u2019t need a ring at all to marry him. It does not matter what your brother expects, thinks is fair or wants.", "NTA - but since you did luck out it might be nice to contribute (only if you\u2019re able) and I wouldn\u2019t contribute more than 1k.  UNLESS your brother already got something from your grandma of similar value.   If that was the case then no. Thing don\u2019t have to be equal but if you\u2019re in. Position to help your brother it would probably make your grandma smile (since she was in a position to help you)", "YTA for this...\n\n>I personally think he should just pay for the ring he can afford\n\nYou mean like you did? Oh, right. You were broke and were given a $10,000 ring that you could never have afforded. What's worse is that now that you're in a position to do the same thing for your brother by helping him, you choose not to, and instead tell him he's being ridiculous for asking you to do basically the same thing that your grandmother did for you. Your grandmother would be so proud, if only she could stop rolling in her grave. \n\nIf you gave him $5,000, it would be like you were splitting the ring with him. You'd both walk away from it knowing that your grandmother's gift went to both of you, and both would have an even bigger memory of her. Sadly, you learned nothing from your grandmother's generosity.", "NTA. Did you luck out, sure. Is that your fault or does that mean now you're obligated to help your brother pay for his engagement ring, not at all. If you can afford it and you trust your brother you could offer to lend him some money. But if he's actively asking for anything more than a loan he's just overstepping his bounds.", "NTA - If brother can't afford a ring, then he needs to put it his engagement off until you can. You did luck out with your grandmother's ring but she wanted to give it to you guys. It's not like you took it from her. I don't know why it would be your responsibility to pay for his future fiance's ring.", "ESH. \n\nCharlie is right to feel a little slighted that you got a very expensive ring for free when you wanted to propose. I think it's understandable to feel that way. That said, he sucks for asking you to pay for his GF's engagement ring instead of just talking to you about it and asking if you'd be willing to help him out a little on the ring purchase.\n\nYou suck because you completely dismissed him without thinking through the fairness of the situation. You got 10k more than he did, essentially. Yes, your grandmother gave it to you, but how would you feel if the situation had been reversed and she gave it to him instead and you were in his shoes now?\n\nIf you value your relationship with your brother, offer a reasonable compromise. Perhaps offer to put a certain amount towards the ring and maybe be willing to loan a bit more than that (for instance, if you offer to pay $2500 towards the ring, but he wants a 5k ring, tell him that the $2500 is a gift and the rest is a loan. Agree on repayment terms). In the long run, the money you spend will pay off in your relationship with your brother and his eventual family down the road. \n\nJust becase you don't HAVE to do something for someone doesn't mean you shouldn't.", "NTA. That's holding a weird grudge for so long.", "NTA, yep, rings are suppose to be something you can afford, jewelers say about 1 month salary for a wedding ring set. He should buy what he can, and on a future anniversary upgrade her ring.", "NTA.\n\n>He asked me since I got my ring free, if Id go in with him to pay for an engagement ring.\n\nYou're not marrying his girlfriend, he is....", "NTA. Your brother is an entitled little AH, isn't he. Sure, you lucked out & got a free engagement ring. But that doesn't obligate you to pay it forward. Some people buy placeholder rings with the promise of a better ring later. Which is something that he can do.", "NTA.\n\nIf he cannot afford an engagement ring, he can\u2019t afford a marriage. Financial troubles are one of the leading causes of divorce. \n\nHe needs to focus on getting a new job.", "NAH", "YTA.\n\nGrandma probably thought she would be around to help your brother. \n\nYou did luck out.\n\nYou don't have to do anything,  really, but you should. \n\nI would give him half the value.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm the youngest of 5 and I have absolutely no idea what my siblings did for engagement rings except for one. He used gold nuggets, that he panned, made into a matching set for him and his wife. The others? I think Mom gave them something out of her jewelry box, but as she didn't like diamonds, she didn't have a bunch of rings lying around. \n\nMy ring once belonged to a great aunt (it was the only diamond ring she had). My mother offered it to my now husband since neither of us had yet thought of a ring. Because of the ring's unusual shape we paid to have the wedding band made to match.\n\nThe story here being, what one sibling received, did not equate equal treatment for all. There was one ring. Your grandmother gave it to you for your bride. Brother needs to make his own arrangements.\n\nHowever, as someone else said, possibly gifting your brother $1k, or whatever, as a nod to your grandmother's generosity might be a nice gesture on  your part.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Rings are symbols. You and your now wife loved each other enough to be married sooner rather than later, and you were happy to get a cheaper ring. Your grandmother loved you AND your wife and chose to pass on her ring. That is super meaningful and nice. \n\nNow, your brother badgering you to cough up money to help buy a ring? Less meaningful.

It\u2019s all a bummer to deal with but he had some real stones asking that you give money to make it even. Realistically though, you got a huge break. Money among family is always weird to navigate. I like to think if I were in your shoes I\u2019d give an earlier and more generous gift of money (maybe $1k?) plus assuring him you\u2019re there to help with the wedding process where you can so he can avoid things like delivery fees or something clever that makes him pay less but not at the expense of you shelling out cash. No easy solution but displays of acknowledgment with some generosity might go a long way.

I was prepared to spend about $500 dollar on one. We just wanted to be married. We love the sentimental value of the ring, but since we'd never sell it, the financial worth isnt really important to us.", "Why would anyone be responsible for paying another half the value of a gift?\nThat's asinine. I bet you have never given your family half the value of your gifts.\n\nThe brother received other gifts from his grandmother, but you aren't demanding the brother pay half the value.\n\nYou would really give, someone you want to marry, a ring that your brother bought?\n\nNot your mother's ring nor your father's mother's ring but a brand new ring that someone else paid for?\n\nYou aren't saying you love her enough to marry her. You are saying you are entitled to her paying your way.\n\nAn engagement ring is personal. Not something you demand others to buy for you. That's just messed up.\nGo buy her a ring from a pawn shop just pay for it yourself. \n\nNo future wife, in her right mind, will accept a brand new ring the man proposing didn't buy. It says she isn't worth his time and efforts but he is worth hers. Eww.", "I am the oldest grand daughter, but because I did not marry first my cousin got a very nice semi expensive set of ear rings. I did not think anything about it since she got married first and my grandmother felt the first one married can have the handed down ear rings (been in the family over 100 years)", "His grandmother gave him a gift. If grandma wanted to gift the brother with something that was up to her.", "By your logic, if OP and his brother each bought a lottery ticket, and OP won $10,000 and his brother won nothing, then OP should give his brother $5,000?\n\nWhat about other siblings?  Or cousins with the same grandmother for that matter?", "This must be the brother", "Are you sure that's what the grandmother thought? My grandparents gave things to older children in our family with no thought to the younger ones. They gave things to those who were married and never thought about the ones that were too young to marry. They gave small gifts to some children and more to others.", "That is only assuming Charlie never got anything from grandma\u2026\u2026what if grandma was still alive and didn\u2019t like the brothers fianc\u00e9e, so didn\u2019t offer them anything, would op still be obligated to support his brother?  We don\u2019t know if grandma left Charlie other jewelry when she passed, or even left Charlie more of something else of equal value that has just since been sold or something.   This attitude reminds me of the aita story of the dad whose young son was nvited to Disneyland by a friend and the mom wanted to say no because the younger daughter wasn\u2019t invited.  Kids., little or big, aren\u2019t promised identical lives, not even equal\u2026\u2026we don\u2019t know what Charlie has gotten from grandma", ">I would give him half the value.\n\nCant imagine that would go over well with OPs wife. \"Hey I know we have a kid and want to make our family even bigger, but Charlie's mad he didnt get a free ring, so we gotta give him 5k\".", "Has he talked to your mom to see if he can have a ring she inherited? A lot of mothers pass on jewelry they inherit to their sons to use as engagement rings. My engagement ring is my husband's great aunt's ring his mother gave him to propose with. My cousin's wife has my grandmother's wedding set his mom passed down to him. That seems like a more reasonable request. NTA", "OK so you have aunts and that must mean you have cousins. So the question is if one of them would have been given it would he be hitting them up for half? And if the whole thing were reversed, are you entitled to go and ask for half?", "How is he planning on paying for a wedding if he can\u2019t afford a ring?", "You obviously know him far better than I do but based on his reaction I would have to wonder if he would actually view the money as a \"loan\" rather than what he was \"due\" and you'd never see a penny. \n\nThe jewelry that your mom received-- did any of the pieces have precious stones that could be set into a new ring for bros fiancee?  Could he wait a year and put aside money for hefty downpayment and finance the rest?  If he did that maybe you could toss in $1K to upgrade the ring a bit (only if it won't break your budget).", "Has he been a good brother otherwise? Was he helpful to you growing up or when you and your wife married and started having kids? Weigh all of that alongside his emotional reaction. He didn't get an inheritance or the memory of your grandparents. He probably feels a lot of pressure with the lay off and his fiance's expectations after 6 years together. \n\nIf he's always been an asshole then that's different.", "But you took it. You didn't declined it bc it was more than you could afford or gave it back to her when you were able to afford a good ring yourself. You took it and kept it, knowing your brother will not be that lucky, knowing your grandma did this bc you were broke and she wanted to help you (and would have most likely also helped your brother now if she still was alive). \n\nYour grandma was a generous woman who cared about her family more than her assets. Its sad this personality traits are not a thing nowadays anymore. \n\nYou are not an asshole for not helping, but you are also not a good brother.", "Plus the grandma actually knew his fianc\u00e9e, it was a gift to two people she loved. There was only one ring, of course it could only be given once. \n\nThe brother not being able to have an honest conversation with his fianc\u00e9e about the ring and its financing isn't a great indicator that he's ready for marriage.", "That is not the same logic at all. \n\nThis was not OP getting a bday gift. It was a random \"gift\" worth a significant amount of money. Not a small token gift. If a grandparent bought one grandkid a car just because and not anyone else it would be unfair/ahole move.\n\nIt is still not on OP to make up for it, but it is understandable to feel slighted.", "No. I am not the brother. \n\nI am a fair-minded female who speaks her mind.", "I said this in another comment but I dont know what my mom got. Just that her and my aunt split the jewelry. It wasnt a ton. Not sure if there are any rings or anything she'd be comfortable parting with.", "Yeah we have a few cousins, and that was a point I made to him too.", "Not defending his brother in the ring situation, but plenty of in laws pay for weddings.", "I dont know what the stuff my mom got looks like, just that she got some. I wouldnt expect her to want to part ways with it but maybe she would. Im not sure what his finances look like, he may be able to finance it.", "He's been fine I guess? We've never been close because we have different interests but we typcially get along fine. We've never given each other money though, I dont like the idea of it unless it were an emergency. He has some things from our grandparents they gave while they were alive", "Of course I didnt decline it, it was a gift, she wasnt selling it to me.", "You're right, it's not the same logic.  A lottery is random, whereas Grandma CHOSE to give the ring to OP and not to Charlie.   I was responding to OP's coworker saying OP \"lucked out.\"   Even if OP \"lucked out\" by getting the ring, why does that mean he has to share it? \n\nGrandma could have left it in her effects to be divided in her estate, or sold it and given every grandchild a portion.  She did not. She wanted OP's wife to have it. No one here is asking whether Grandma was the asshole here.  For the record she would not be, because the ring was hers and it was up to her to decide what to do with it.", "I think that he might see your life and think well you should just help because it's so easy for you. Not that it is actually fair, because I can guarantee you he would be telling you tough!", "I can totally see where he wants a nice ring for his fiancee and feels it was a bit unfair that you got such a nice ring from grandma HOWEVER that doesn't mean I think YOU should pay for half of her ring either.", "And an engagement ring is a WANT not a NEED, nor is it an emergency. you were well within your rights to say now. He's being childish and selfish.", "I agree OP is not an ahole, and does not have to make up for it. \n\nMaybe this is semantics, but OP was lucky, not in a something happened to him by random chance, but being gifted a $10k engagement is lucky/nice/fortunate. \n\n\"For the record she would not be, because the ring was hers and it was up to her to decide what to do with it.\"\n\nAbsent other circumstances giving one grandchild such a huge/valuable gift and not others I do think would make them an ahole. I think parents/grandparents should try to be fair/equal. \n\nIt does not mean everyone gets exactly the same thing. But disproportionate gift giving should be avoided. \n\nIf grandparent/grand child worked to repair a classic car together it makes sense to give it to that grandchild, but an item of similar value/cash equivalent should be given to others. \n\nIt would be different if the situation was on grand child was close visited/called grandparents and the other choose to not do that.", "We don't have all the details, but OP was close enough to grandma that grandma was able to get close to his then-GF more than 7 years ago.   To be fair I don't suppose she had any idea how much the ring was worth.  To her it was not a fungible item like a bank account--it had sentimental value and she wanted OP's wife to have it.\n\nBTW that makes OP 29 now and brother Charlie is 31.  Charlie's been with his GF for 6 years, and Grandma's been gone for 2.  So there was 4 years for Charlie and his GF to get on Grandma's good side if that was want they or she wanted. \n\nMy brother and sister still live near my mother. He cuts her grass; she does her shopping.  I'm 350 miles away.  I think it is 100% OK if my mother leaves more to my siblings, or gives them things now.  We don't know OP's or Charlie's relationship to Grandma and should not judge her choices."]}
