Unfortunately this is one of those situations where timing in life did not play out to treat you and your sibling with an exact equal result.

He can wait until he gets a job and and saves the money. You don't owe him anything. Your grandma died 2 years ago, after he'd been with his gf for 4 years, she had plenty of time to gift him something (like whatever she gave your mum and aunt) but chose not to.

Even if you don't see it as sentimental, your grandmother ***definitely*** did. You have no obligation to pay for your brother's ring just because you were gifted one. That's ridiculous to a T. He can go to the bank, make payment plans, etc if it's that important he gets one right away. Or, he can be an adult, and speak with his GF about this.

Life isn\u2019t fair. Sometime it is a matter of timing whether something works for one person but fails for another.  Grandma has a relationship with OP\u2019s then gf, this lead to her wanting to give her ring when they wanted to marry. OP\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t getting married or close to it, so why would Grandma think about \u201cfairness\u201d regarding gifting a ring.

The ring was given to you at a different time.  Those who are considering it an inheritance are just not right.  I have some jewelry from my grandmother given to me years before she passed.  That was separate from inheritance which was split evenly.  \n\nYour brother is being entitled (to your money). He needs to purchase a ring he can afford.  I think there is more to his ring story than he is telling you. Maybe he promised a ring greater than he can afford. Maybe he has been saying he has been saving for a ring for years. Maybe her family has certain expectations of what he can afford. Etc.", "NTA - if he can\u2019t pay he shouldn\u2019t propose simple as that.

His financial situation sucks, and it might have been okay if he had asked for a loan, with the intention of paying it back, but outright asking for the money and then insulting you and calling you selfish when you don't agree is incredibly rude.\n\nSurely there are places that have payment plans, so he doesn't have to give over a lot of money all at once.", "NTA - this is something he needs to buy his fiancee. \n\nIt isn\u2019t your job to pay for his since your grandmother gifted you her ring.", "NTA. If he can't afford a ring now, maybe he shouldn't propose until he can afford something.", "NTA, but I do see your brother's point.  You didn't have to start with that debt, and your grandmother could have just said, \"well, get what you can afford\" but she didn't.  It is wonderful that you have that beautiful story.  It is sad that there isn't a story like that for your brother.  Imagine how you would feel if he were gifted 10k.  You got nothing.  It just helps.  I am not saying you have to gift him 5k or 10k, but maybe talk to him and see what his thoughts were on what you could contribute?", "NAH. Unless your brother also got an inheritance worth 10k he's just asking if you'll make things fair. It's not a ridiculous question. \n\nIt's not your responsibility, though. If you're comfortable giving him a loan you can offer that, but any time you loan money to family you shouldn't expect to get it back.", "NTA. It is tacky to ask someone else to pay for an engagement ring. If they can't afford the real thing, make do with fake or without. The engagement is not all about the ring.", "NTA. Grandma helped you out when you were just getting started in life at 22. That was her gift to give. You don\u2019t owe your brother anything for grandma\u2019s gift. It\u2019s also a weird timing for your brother to decide to propose with a ring he can\u2019t afford right after being fired. Next he\u2019ll ask you to pay for the wedding because he got fired and you still have a job so you lucked out again.", ">I honestly thought that was ridiculous\n\nAnd you are correct. **NTA**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I personally think he should just pay for the ring he can afford and if she wants to at a later time in life upgrade it when their finances are better. \n\nAlso correct. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> i was telling my coworker about it, he said he understand Charlies point and that I did luck out.\n\nProblem solved! : Coworker can chip in! Maybe go halfsies?", "NTA.  I have major second hand embarrassment reading this post. Your brother is ridiculous.  I think it\u2019s disgusting when people feel that they are entitled to or owed an inheritance.  The audacity to ask you to help pay for an engagement right.  A grown man trying to eat off your family\u2019s plate?? How pathetic.  Your grandmother chose to give you her ring. That\u2019s the end of it.  You don\u2019t owe him shit.  He needs to get a job and save up to buy a ring.  Ya know like a grown ass man. What\u2019s next? Will he expect you to help pay for the wedding? Contribute the honeymoon?", "NTA. Your grandmother chose to gift one to you, that does not mean that you have to buy rings for others.", "NTA.\n\nYou were gifted the ring by your grandmother while she was alive, and she liked and approved of your then-fiancee.  None of that applies to your brother or his girlfriend, although I suppose they must have met.\n\nYes, you \"lucked out\" but in the end it is no different than if you won $10,000 in the lottery.  How much of that would your brother feel entitled to?", "NTA There is no law that states his girlfriend must be given a ring of equal vale to your wife\u2019s ring. His girlfriend doesn\u2019t need a ring at all to marry him. It does not matter what your brother expects, thinks is fair or wants.", "NTA - but since you did luck out it might be nice to contribute (only if you\u2019re able) and I wouldn\u2019t contribute more than 1k.  UNLESS your brother already got something from your grandma of similar value.   If that was the case then no. Thing don\u2019t have to be equal but if you\u2019re in. Position to help your brother it would probably make your grandma smile (since she was in a position to help you)", "YTA for this...\n\n>I personally think he should just pay for the ring he can afford\n\nYou mean like you did? Oh, right. You were broke and were given a $10,000 ring that you could never have afforded. What's worse is that now that you're in a position to do the same thing for your brother by helping him, you choose not to, and instead tell him he's being ridiculous for asking you to do basically the same thing that your grandmother did for you. Your grandmother would be so proud, if only she could stop rolling in her grave. \n\nIf you gave him $5,000, it would be like you were splitting the ring with him. You'd both walk away from it knowing that your grandmother's gift went to both of you, and both would have an even bigger memory of her. Sadly, you learned nothing from your grandmother's generosity.", "NTA. Did you luck out, sure. Is that your fault or does that mean now you're obligated to help your brother pay for his engagement ring, not at all. If you can afford it and you trust your brother you could offer to lend him some money. But if he's actively asking for anything more than a loan he's just overstepping his bounds.", "NTA - If brother can't afford a ring, then he needs to put it his engagement off until you can. You did luck out with your grandmother's ring but she wanted to give it to you guys. It's not like you took it from her. I don't know why it would be your responsibility to pay for his future fiance's ring.", "ESH. \n\nCharlie is right to feel a little slighted that you got a very expensive ring for free when you wanted to propose. I think it's understandable to feel that way. That said, he sucks for asking you to pay for his GF's engagement ring instead of just talking to you about it and asking if you'd be willing to help him out a little on the ring purchase.\n\nYou suck because you completely dismissed him without thinking through the fairness of the situation. You got 10k more than he did, essentially. Yes, your grandmother gave it to you, but how would you feel if the situation had been reversed and she gave it to him instead and you were in his shoes now?\n\nIf you value your relationship with your brother, offer a reasonable compromise. Perhaps offer to put a certain amount towards the ring and maybe be willing to loan a bit more than that (for instance, if you offer to pay $2500 towards the ring, but he wants a 5k ring, tell him that the $2500 is a gift and the rest is a loan. Agree on repayment terms). In the long run, the money you spend will pay off in your relationship with your brother and his eventual family down the road. \n\nJust becase you don't HAVE to do something for someone doesn't mean you shouldn't.", "NTA. That's holding a weird grudge for so long.", "NTA, yep, rings are suppose to be something you can afford, jewelers say about 1 month salary for a wedding ring set. He should buy what he can, and on a future anniversary upgrade her ring.", "NTA.\n\n>He asked me since I got my ring free, if Id go in with him to pay for an engagement ring.\n\nYou're not marrying his girlfriend, he is....", "NTA. Your brother is an entitled little AH, isn't he. Sure, you lucked out & got a free engagement ring. But that doesn't obligate you to pay it forward. Some people buy placeholder rings with the promise of a better ring later. Which is something that he can do.", "NTA.\n\nIf he cannot afford an engagement ring, he can\u2019t afford a marriage. Financial troubles are one of the leading causes of divorce. \n\nHe needs to focus on getting a new job.", "NAH", "YTA.\n\nGrandma probably thought she would be around to help your brother. \n\nYou did luck out.\n\nYou don't have to do anything,  really, but you should. \n\nI would give him half the value.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm the youngest of 5 and I have absolutely no idea what my siblings did for engagement rings except for one. He used gold nuggets, that he panned, made into a matching set for him and his wife. The others? I think Mom gave them something out of her jewelry box, but as she didn't like diamonds, she didn't have a bunch of rings lying around. \n\nMy ring once belonged to a great aunt (it was the only diamond ring she had). My mother offered it to my now husband since neither of us had yet thought of a ring. Because of the ring's unusual shape we paid to have the wedding band made to match.\n\nThe story here being, what one sibling received, did not equate equal treatment for all. There was one ring. Your grandmother gave it to you for your bride. Brother needs to make his own arrangements.\n\nHowever, as someone else said, possibly gifting your brother $1k, or whatever, as a nod to your grandmother's generosity might be a nice gesture on  your part.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Rings are symbols. You and your now wife loved each other enough to be married sooner rather than later, and you were happy to get a cheaper ring. Your grandmother loved you AND your wife and chose to pass on her ring. That is super meaningful and nice. \n\nNow, your brother badgering you to cough up money to help buy a ring? Less meaningful.

It\u2019s all a bummer to deal with but he had some real stones asking that you give money to make it even. Realistically though, you got a huge break. Money among family is always weird to navigate. I like to think if I were in your shoes I\u2019d give an earlier and more generous gift of money (maybe $1k?) plus assuring him you\u2019re there to help with the wedding process where you can so he can avoid things like delivery fees or something clever that makes him pay less but not at the expense of you shelling out cash. No easy solution but displays of acknowledgment with some generosity might go a long way.

They wouldn\u2019t dream of asking for money from him", "Does this mean I can make my brother pay for my car since he got a hand me down from our grandma when he was in high school? Sweet.", "It wasn't an inheritance though, right? His grandma gave him the ring before she died. It's her right to give her property to whoever she wants and, considering it was given specifically as a result of him getting married, you can't exactly chalk this up to favoritism from the grandma.", "^ This!", "Maybe grandma's ring *new* would be worth $10k but it's second hand, so it's likely worth a lot less than that.  Seeing as it's all about the money for OP's brother, maybe OP should find out what the ring is now worth- it's possible that his brother could afford a ring in that price range, and he might be able to get something second hand that's pretty nice.  Just pointing this out bc a lot of people assume their jewellery from grandma or whoever is worth a lot, but often it just isn't...", "Here's the comment I was looking for. Getting married so young, OP's grandma could well have given him nothing. OP isn't obligated to help his brother, but seems like he lacks empathy. From the day the ring was given to him, OP should have realized he's getting a priceless gift that his sibling/s would be denied.", "And open the door for the brother to hold his hand out every time he wants something OP has?\n\nIt\u2019s not even a loan, brother is being simultaneously being cheap and trying to keep up with appearances.\n\nThis is the solution a people pleaser would come up with.", "My wife and I talked and both agree the whole thing is ridiculous. If he asks again, Ill offer him an advance on a wedding gift of $250. The rings I was looking at before my grandma gave me hers were all around $500 or less. So thats what Im basing the amount on.", "NAH but I do think unequal inheritance and/or playing favorites while still alive just sets up siblings and families to not like each other. You're not the asshole for not splitting a gift's value that he didn't also receive, but I also don't think he's an asshole for wanting the same helping hand you got. It is what it is, you did luck out, and there's no real way around one of you harboring some bitterness from the sound of it. It's not like it's a house. He'll get over it I'm sure.", "Tell him to look for a cheaper \"placeholder\" ring!", "I'm sorry, but your brother's priorities are backwards. I get where he's coming from. At the same time, if my sister/daughter/cousin (take your pick) came home with an expensive ring and I found out that the fianc\u00e9 had just lost his job, I would be side-eyeing the fianc\u00e9 and judging their relationship like crazy because no way would I believe that the fianc\u00e9 had enough sound (financial) judgment to take good care of my loved one. I also would possibly be whispering words of cautions in private to my loved one while waiting for their relationship to implode. \n\n\nNTA btw. You gave your brother good, sound advice. Your brother is doing himself a disfavor for disregarding it and throwing his little tantrum.", "I can't imagine her family being thrilled if she gets engaged to someone currently unemployed. They have been together a good number of years so maybe it isn't a big deal, but as a stranger on the internet it doesn't sound good.\n\nIt isn't like they can plan a decent wedding while he is unemployed either because that also makes cash tight. If he is too broke to buy a ring a wedding is impossible. Even if her family helps he is \"broke\" until he gets a job. He can wait to propose.\n\nNTA, regardless of your brother's employment status.", "One of my friends has a moissanite ring and it\u2019s gorgeous. Much bigger and nicer than she could have gotten if it were diamond and you really can\u2019t tell.", "Curious, how much money did he have save for the engagement ring?", "Have you thought about gifting him a small monetary gift to help even if you don\u2019t gift him 5k? I can understand him feeling resentment that you got a leg up in life that he doesn\u2019t get. You have the right to say \u201ctough luck that I got something and you don\u2019t\u201d but I think approaching this with some empathy will go a long way in your relationship.", "But she did give it to you and now you have the chance to pay it forward, so that your brother can get something better than what he can currently afford, just like you did", "The number of mental gymnastics you had to go through to defend OP's selfish position is astonishing. How is OP giving him a gift of say $5,000, and then going out and buying his future bride a ring using that gift, in any way something to the brother should be ashamed of? \n\nAnd frankly, the more I look at OP's comments, the more I think he went to his grandmother with a sob story about being broke in order to get help with the ring. He says he was just going to buy one for $500, but instead went to grandma and told her that he was going to propose, and told her he had no ring or that he couldn't afford an expensive one. Sounds fishy to me.", "I think talking to your brother, completely having both of you put all the cards on the table, is going to be the best option.  \n\nBecause the whole thing of 'this is ridiculous'  'advance of a wedding gift' kind of stuff is what I find ridiculous.  \n\nlike \"hey bro, i got this $10,000+ hugely sentimental ring that can be considered a family heirloom for free because I was getting married first before grandma died, but I know your struggling so here is $250 and btw, that's your wedding gift\"\n\nLike if you wanted to preface with some context like you supporting your grandmother greatly, your brother being a dick, his girlfriend being someone that his grandmother would disapprove of, or any other reasoning why you should deserve it more than him, at least that would have been something but now you really are just being an asshole.  \n\nIf it really is something that matters this little, why not you and your wife give the ring from your grandmother to him and you get the $500 ring. \n\nThis is most likely just some troll post from some lonely man sitting in a rented room and that's why he's using a burner account because he has nothing going for him in his life.", "Maybe look at second hand rings? That's what your ring is, when you set aside the relationship and sentimental value that your brother isn't interested in.", "May not be about affording it but feeling left out that the two kids weren\u2019t treated equally.", "Probably  with this: \" His gf has a good job but for obvious reasons, he doesnt want to ask her to pay for her own engagement ring.\"", "Exactly there are some beautiful cheaper rings on Etsy that even look like the \"real thing.\"", "Yeah, you seem to have defined mental gymnastics. Your anger towards OP is dominant.\nNow you are making his story up... Talk about mental gymnastics.\n\nYou never answered my question. Who did you pay half the value to for your gifts?\nWhy aren't you declaring the brother, should Give OP half the value of the gifts grandma gave him?\n\nAre you someone who felt entitled to another's income and got set straight?\n\nIt's terrible to ask someone to marry you with a ring your brother bought for her. Eww.", ">If it really is something that matters this little, why not you and your wife give the ring from your grandmother to him and you get the $500 ring.\n\nMy Grandma gifted the ring to me and I gifted it to my now wife. Its not my ring to gift and Im sure as hell not going to suggest that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This is most likely just some troll post from some lonely man sitting in a rented room and that's why he's using a burner account because he has nothing going for him in his life.\n\nYou are partially correct in that Im working from Home in rented room right now lol. The rest is off.", "Suggest to your brother to ask your mom if she can /is willing to give him a ring to propose with - it could be a place holder until he is back on his feet and if your mom agrees he would also have a 'family heirloom ' from your mom to preserve \n\nNTA for not wanting to pay for a ring.", "~~You could look at it as the ring was your inheritance.  Then you could give your brother whatever $ you got from her estate (the couple thousand).~~  You are under NO obligation to give your brother any money.  The ring was a gift from your grandmother to you and your gf at the time, who she knew and loved.   ~~do so, it's just one possible idea if you decide to help him.~~   NTA\n\nEdited bc I read the facts wrong apparently.", "Asking mom for one of the rings seems the closest to the intention your grandmother showed towards you. It\u2019s super weird to expect someone to buy something so intimate for you.", "Info: did they give him things of equal monetary value or just sentimental items? If they are just sentimental, I would consider giving him a small monetary gift \u201cthis $500 is all that I can afford. I hope that it can help you toward your goal of buying a ring for your girlfriend\u201d. Or if he gave you a generous gift for your wedding, I would consider giving that back to him as a way of paying it forward. Personally, if he was a considerate uncle and has done nice things for your family, I would take that into consideration in your decision versus if he has not gifted anything on your special occasions.", "Ignore them, they\u2019ve never been anyone\u2019s favorite anything and it shows.\n\nYou were given an heirloom, he was not he can deal.  Grandma could\u2019ve offered a ring to your brother to use in the years since, she chose not to.", "Your the only one that seems angry here. \n\nAnd you never asked me that question, but I'm happy to say that I have. I had a parent that had a habit of favoring me unintentionally. I would often share these gifts with my siblings as it was only fair.  The thing is that you won't believe this because it's not something you would do, so therefore you assune nobody would. \n\nAnd if grandma gave the brother far more than OP, then I'd absolutely say that the brother owes OP something, but OP never even remotely hinted that this was the case. \n\nAnd since you have this thing about being entitled to answers, why did you skip over mine?  Shocking, I say.  Simply shocking. LOL", "Ring gifted and gifted but now can't be gifted. \n\nAlso 29 years old, married for 7 years, working from home in a rented room when you and your wife have good jobs and a kid?  I don't think I was off at all.  I think you can't keep track of your own stories\n\nSo my best guess is not married, the ring isn't real, the situation isn't real, and you are just lonely.", "I cant help but feel like thats kinda crumby. He said she doesnt have much from her own mother and we want him to try to get her to depart with more of it. Not because he's so close to his grandma but because of the money aspect. Just feels wrong to me. There are plenty of cheap rings you can get for less than $100. Nothing wrong with proposing with a cheap placeholder ring for now and upgrading at a later date.", "He said they didnt get anything in inheritance, his mom and her siblings got a couple thousand. I still dont think he should give him a dime though. The man is 31 and its not an emergency, there are plenty of cheap rings out there.", "What a bizarre insult to hurl at someone over a reddit comment.\n\nAnd generally speaking, people normally only have one engagement ring. She also may have had no idea how valuable it was and likely couldn't have afforded to help the brother in a similar fashion.", "Dude only about a third of people under 30 own a home in the US. My partner and I have good jobs too but a home in the neighborhood we live in starts at 700k. It doesnt mean we dont have good jobs because we dont have 140k for a down payment. So for now we rent a nice place in a neighborhood we like and save money each month until the day we do have enough, you sound pretty out of touch.", "Not sure why you think its not realistic for people to be under 30 with a kid, and not own their home but ok lol. Pretty sure thats incredibly common. We have good jobs, just not enough cash to buy a home in our city where the average single family home goes for around 1 million. \n\nRing is very much real and its crazy how would suggest she give up whats her ring now. Im not even going to suggest that, because that would be insane. Have a lovely day haha", "Honestly, I agree. If there is a ring, it's one of the few keepsakes she has of her only mother. The sentimental value for her is likely tremendous. He could absolutely get a simple placeholder ring, even something without a stone that can symbolize their commitment while he saves up.", "I agree, especially as it appears Charlie is older than OP. So Charlie is reaching out to his younger sibling and expecting financial help?", "Thanks.  I guess I read it wrong.  When he said all people got a couple thousand, I thought it included him and his brother.  Don't disagree he owes him nothing.", "[removed]", "This is so insane.\n\nBrother: Get\u2019s laid off.\n\nAlso Brother: I want to buy an engagement ring.
