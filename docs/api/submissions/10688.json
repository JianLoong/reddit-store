Please prevent from asking me about my marriage and how it was an awful idea, I will say that we had no other choice and end it of there.\n\nNo way are we financially struggling, I'm a house wife and we do not have kids. Its just to refer to that he wouldn't have to work over time to afford a living.\n\nThat being said when i was turning 21, my husband said we should go out for dinner at 7 PM. its a vivid memory for me. ok. he finishes work at 6:30 so that was fine, i dressed up and stayed ready , it was nearly 8:45 when i got fed up and called him asking where he was but his phone was turned off. weird. maybe out of charge? I continuously called until around 12? AM and then I got scared that he was in some trouble so I called his best friend\n\nHe told me that my husband was with him and that he had a rough day and just didn't wanna speak to anyone so he was at the bar. I felt sorry that he had a rough day but at least he could've texted me. I waited more than 6 hours (i changed back at 1AM) and he came home at 2 i think because i was asleep and i didnt know when he came back. He gets me gift and stuff but like i was really upset about it and following year, same thing happened. since my 22nd birthday I gave up and all my birthdays since then, I spent it with my girl friends. And I enjoyed it, i didnt have to stay up worrying and actually enjoyed my youth. It felt great.\n\nThis year, I went shopping on my birthday at like 12 PM? (memories a bit dusty lol) and then i saw my friends at the mall and we ended up going to a restaurant and spending our entire day there talking, shopping eating etc. My phone must've been on silent mode or out of charge because apparently my husband was calling me a lot. I got home near 8PM and I see our entire living room with decor, a cake on the table we have by the sofa and just like a really festive decorated room, my husband was on the sofa with his head in his head and he was extremely upset with me because he set up a surprise for me and all his friends waited for 4 hrs for me to come back home. He didn't really yell at me but was upset. I really don't think I am guilty but there is a guilty feeling but how was i suppose to know he set up a surprise for me. Its always the same way every year, he gets me a new bag and a bunch of make up and thats all we do on my birthday.\n\nAITA for spending my birthday with my friends instead of my husband?", "created_utc": 1677116543, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119krkd/aita_for_spending_my_birthday_with_my_friends/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just on your birthday?", "NTA. He's bailed and left you alone multiple birthdays so you did your own thing. And he held a surprise party with HIS friends? What about your friends? He messed up multiple times and did with this as well. You didn't do anything wrong", "I like that she ran into her friends at the mall, but all his friends are at the surprise party. That says a lot to me.", "NTA husband sounds really immature to be married. Bruh can\u2019t send a text that he\u2019s at a bar? Plz. You do you. He\u2019s definitely going to keep doing him.", "NTA. I'd make my own plans too. You're not a mind reader to know about a surprise party and he never even let you know that you should stay home at least the night before?? That's kind of a must when you're planning a surprise. You make sure to let the person know where to be and when. I hope you use this opportunity to express how you felt with the first few birthdays he's botched for you and maybe this can help both of you strengthen your communication. Wish you the best and Happy Birthday!", ">he was extremely upset with me because he set up a surprise for me and all **his** friends waited for 4 hrs for me to come back home.\n\n**HIS** friends.\n\nThat says everything you need to know.\n\nThe party wasn't for you, the party was so he could show what a super awesome husband he is. I have to question why he suddenly did this after years of a predictable pattern. He had to know you would spend the day out, so why invite his friends to something that will only make you look bad?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "Sounds like Karma to me.

If he didn't mention a time to be home before the day of then That's really on him. And woth him setting the expectation of him putting himself over you on your birthday you took the day for yourself. (Not saying he is a bad husband just noting that your birthday is generally not as important as his rough day).  Taking the day for yourself is a wonderful way to handle it. He changed it without warning. Not your issue sweetie.", "NTA. If it only happened once, maybe, but when it happens every year there's no way you're at fault. Do not feel guilty, even though it's nice he finally did try.", ">all his friends\n\nSo, a birthday party for you that only his friends were invited to?\n\nThis was a party for him with the extra bonus of pretending to be a good dutiful husband for image points. \n\n\nNTA, but even if you look past all the relationship red flags, what kind of AH sets up a surprise party without coordinating the arrival of the guest of honor, he ruined his own party.", "NTA. You had no way to know he was going to be there celebrating. You should keep doing things with your friends because he will probably use it as an excuse for another 5 years.", "Well well well, the turn tables", "NTA", "NTA.  That's really sad that he doesn't know how to handle your birthdays.", "NTA. He's never shown a real interest in celebrating your birthday before. 2 years of him blowing you off and leaving you on your own. 2 years of him doing nothing and you doing your own thing with friends.\n\nWhy did he think that you would expect this year to be any different? He set the precedents here, you were only following them.\n\nIf he's upset, he needs to stop, reflect on **his** failure of the last four years, and apologize to you. Something that it sounds like he's failed to do.\n\nThe only way you'd need to apologize to him (or feel any guilt) is if he'd actually made arrangements to do something with you, and you blew him off. Which is does not sound he did. So you're in the clear.\n\nThis also highlights his supreme failure as a Party Planner (Surprise Version)...\n\nTask 1 of surprise party planning is to ensure that the guest of honor will be at the right place at the right time. This is correctly done by having someone who will be with them to steer them in the right direction.\n\nRelying on the person to show up in the right place at the right time does not count. (I've had experience on that one... as the wayward surprisee) His method of calling to get you to come home is hardly any better. As evidenced by what happened.\n\nActively arranging to do something or recruiting someone to the task is the one true way here. The failure there is also all on him.", "NTA when you throw someone a surprise party, you better make sure to create a plan to get them there. He can\u2019t just call you right before and expect you to run back home.  Also, considering how badly he messed up your previous birthdays, you had no reason to suspect he was doing anything for you this year.", "NTA\n\nThrough the years, your husband has taught you not to expect anything from him for your birthday -- not even to expect him to honor his commitment to be with you.  Therefore, you expected nothing and celebrated with your girlfriends.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.\n\nIt is nice that he finally made an effort to do something special for your birthday, even though he screwed it up.  Assuming you plan to stay married to your husband, is there anything the two of you can do to work on your marriage?  Even if you don't have intense, romantic feelings toward one another, it seems that things have a great deal of room for improvement.\n\nWould the two of you consider talking a marital therapist, preferably one with a good understanding of arranged marriage?

I say \"her\" advisedly, as I suspect you'd be a lot more comfortable with a woman.)", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t just throw a surprise party and hope the guest of honour shows up. You\u2019re supposed to come up with a whole ruse to make sure they get there at just the right moment. \n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t have the strongest planning skills. \n\nAdd to that the context of previous birthdays and it\u2019s just extra NTA with a side of \u201cif he would have invited *your* friends to celebrate *you* on *your* birthday\u201d this might have gone way better.\n\nPlus why was the party scheduled for 4 PM??", "So, all of *his* friends came over on your birthday at 4PM?

And why wouldn't you want to make sure your phone was on to get any well wishes from anyone not at the mall with you? \n\nMaybe you didn't realize you were ignoring your husband, but that was PA.

If this party really was for you he'd have invited your friends instead of his. But he knew you'd be out with them. I bet he's been getting flak about his behavior and did this elaborate plan that he knew would make you feel guilty and then he's off the hook again in the future \n\nDo not feel guilty. He's honestly been an AH for years!\n\nNTA and happy birthday", "NTA\n\nHe planned it poorly. \n\nIf you set up a surprise, the number 1 thing is to make sure the celebrant is where they are supposed to be.", "Did he try calling any of your friends? Wait, does he even have their number?\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. The party wasn't really for you anyway, if it was he would have invited your friends.  The party was to make him look good in front of his friends.  But considering on your 21st he abandoned you, and then has done nothing in subsequent years how can he expect you to stay at home hoping for something that may never come.  If he wanted to make sure you were there he should have made plans with you, so you would have come home by a certain time.", "NTA. He could have let you know that he planned something special and ask you when you were going to be home. The guilt you feel is normal - even when we didn't do anything wrong, if our actions hurt someone we love, we feel guilty about it. Not feeling guilty is a sign of psychopathy, so the guilt is a good thing!

Good luck.", "At least tell him what you are doing", "4 years. It started with her 21st.

Lol. That would have solved the whole situation. Both his an hers friends should have been invited.", "his friends helped with decorating, one of his friends do baking so im pretty sure he made the cake, given that he posted the pic on his ig. my friends and his friends arent too close since we have had a bit commotion before so we like to keep them seperated", "I think he has done it 3-4 times (including my birthday), he gets emotionally distraught easily so i think perhaps its to help him relax? idk.", "I'll answer most of the questions on your comment; Yes it was a weekend, and do keep in mind family traditions are different, in my  family tradition, we start birthday parties at 12PM until 2 AM. Its  a way of showing how much we care by spending the day together.   \nwe dont drink often either so its not as if it was a night party with music and drinks, just a casual get together.  \n I usually turn my phone off when I'm on a day out, my family doesnt live near me and nor are we close enough to wish each other happy birthday, I wont go more into that.   \nI may be angry but i wouldnt do something shitty just to get back at him, im not stooping to his level.", "The fact remains that The First Rule Of Surprise Parties is that you figure out how to ensure that the surprise guest 1) has no other plans, and 2) will be at the party location on time. There are a number of ways to do this, including enlisting the help of one or more of the surprise guest's friends to pull off the scheduling.\n\nYour husband screwed up massively, because he didn't bother to do either of these things. \n\nYou are NTA for taking care of yourself, since the last 4 years he's demonstrated that he couldn't care less about your birthday. Do not let him blame you, and do not feel guilty; you've done nothing wrong.\n\nYour husband needs to step up and learn how to be a better husband. There's more to that than just being a financial provider. Perhaps he should look into counseling or classes on how to be a better partner.", "Well that seems like a whole separate issue. Not what this post is about. You\u2019re not a mind reader. Did you two not communicate plans throughout the day?

I\u2019m thinking they might\u2019ve called him out on it and he was doing this more for show", "Fair enough, if that\u2019s the reason and it\u2019s only a few times over years then that part itself doesn\u2019t seem like a big issue. \n\nHe may be sad and there be a guilty feeling because he\u2019s actually sad with himself, you had no reason to believe he\u2019d do something like throw you a surprise based on his previous behaviour and he\u2019s only himself to blame for that. Whether he\u2019s willing to acknowledge that he created this situation or not is another story. I find it a little odd that he invited his friends and not yours to a surprise party for your birthday though, sounds a bit more like a party for himself.", "Well, then, I guess it was indeed hilarious. I wouldn't feel bad for him after his past years. But why did he plan this party without your friends?", "my friends and him arent close so they dont keep regular contact, hes only close with 2 of my friends for emergency contacts and they were available at the surprise party. the friends i was hanging out with at the mall, he doesnt know them.", "Yall don't actually like each other do you?", "Wouldn't be shocked if he was hanging with friends and one of them possibly was like \"oh isn't it OPs bday today?\" And husband had to on the spot say \"yeah I'm planning on a surprise party. Think you guys could help?\" Or smth like that. It's highly unlikely it was out of the blue after 4 years of missing out", "Why don\u2019t you think he\u2019s an asshole?", "Then he shouldn\u2019t have invited his friends. A surprise party should include guests who are friends with the person being surprised not the person organising it."]}
