Do we have to review every eventuality to come to some sort of understanding of what we are talking about.  IMO every one of the negative votes for me about arguing is the result of someone thinking of a particular example that doesn't fit the general concept that I am trying to convey.   I will continue to advocate that people try to evaluate the situation that they are in and try to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering on each other.    Two different opinions don't have to be mutually exclusive.   People don't have to agree on everything.  People can agree to disagree.   Sorry that I assumed that everyone would at least try to understand the point that I am trying to make.   An argument is not a disagreement.   Try to avoid arguments.

Suddenly, my dad appears, the two gallons in his hands, with a distant look like he's seen a ghost.\n\n\"There's a dog shedding EVERYWHERE back there,\" he hisses under his breath, wild-eyed and tense.\n\nMy mom stares at him. Even picturing the biggest clumps of fur she can imagine, she doesn't get why he is so flustered. \n\n\"Oookay,\" she says, as my dad gently puts the milk in the cart. \n\nShe goes back to the list, with my dad repeating himself to her urgently, not understanding why my mother didn't have the reaction he expected. \"Shedding EVERywhere,\" he whispers, again and again. \"I had to step over it, it was horrible!\"\n\nIt is of note that we, at the time, did in fact have a large dog that shed fur everywhere, to the point of vacuuming every day. My mom was the one who worried the most about it, so again, she didn't understand why my dad, who didn't care as much about the fur, was so seemingly distraught.\n\nFinally, my mom turns to my dad and says, \"what is the big deal about shedding?\"\n\nIt clicks for my dad at this moment, and his face shows a sudden moment of clarity and realization.\n\n\"Not SHED-ding,\" he says, pronouncing the latter word with two syllables, \"SH*T-ting.\"\n\n\n\nYep.

They tried to tell me \"oh, you could have brought him in!\" Nope. No way. He was still too exuberant after a trip in the pet store and a thirty minute power walk.
