Do we have to review every eventuality to come to some sort of understanding of what we are talking about.  IMO every one of the negative votes for me about arguing is the result of someone thinking of a particular example that doesn't fit the general concept that I am trying to convey.   I will continue to advocate that people try to evaluate the situation that they are in and try to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering on each other.    Two different opinions don't have to be mutually exclusive.   People don't have to agree on everything.  People can agree to disagree.   Sorry that I assumed that everyone would at least try to understand the point that I am trying to make.   An argument is not a disagreement.   Try to avoid arguments. Arguments injure/destroy relationships.   Have disagreements and resolve them through conversations that reinforce the union.", "Omg best description ever!!!!", "People always tell me \u201cI hate chihuahuas \u2026 except for your dog\u201d.

He's a prescribed emotional support animal to ease my symptoms of sensory overload from Autism and anxiety. As much as I would adore being able to take him with me everywhere... a) a dog is a lot of work to manage in public (even the best-behaved service animal is still an animal, and you can't control other people who might try to pet, feed, or otherwise harass your essential medical device) and b) I recognize that his right to be in public is unrecognized because he's not considered a service animal. He just doesn't have the training and temperament to go public. \n\nThe literal ONLY reason a service animal is allowed to go into places with food is because the needs of the person with a disability trumps the risk of animal hair for health and safety.
