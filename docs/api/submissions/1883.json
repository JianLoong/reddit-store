NTA", "NTA, and you should not be bringing any animal that isn't a service animal into a place like a store or restaurant.\n\nYour dog is a nuisance if it barks or urinates/defecates in an inappropriate location, it's a health code violation, it's a liability if it bites a person or another dog, and it makes it harder for people who have real service animals to get the accommodations they need.\n\nAnd on top of that, if you bring a reactive dog that is barking and lunging at other animals, you could distract a service dog from doing its job (which may be life saving depending on what the person needs it for), and while a Chihuahua probably wouldn't cause this, if a reactive dog bites or attacks a service dog it could undo all of its training and render it useless (as a service dog).\n\nThere are just so many reasons why you don't bring dogs that aren't service animals into places like that.

Yes supermarkets have a spot where you can secure them with a leash but dog kidnappings are a bigger thing than most people think, ESPECIALLY with chihuahuas since they're popular, sell for good price, and are easy to grab.

He made the request and then he argued with her.  Arguments beget arguments.  If you and others think about it maybe you'll come to the conclusion that you never won an argument.   You only succeeded in getting angry with whomever you were arguing with.   That was followed by the cold shoulder which led to resentment.   Combat is almost never a solution.   It was after WWII, so maybe if the argument is at that level, it can be won ... with how many casualties?", "An argument is not a disagreement.   Disagreements occur naturally amongst adults.   Conversation solves disagreements.   Arguments are not disagreements because they are usually emotionally charged and coupled with antisocial behaviors and comments.   You are correct in your statement that disagreements can and usually are constructive.    You may think that this is an exercise in semantics.   It is not.   It's a distinction that separates adult interaction and childish misbehavior.", "I have a chihuahua and I treat her like a big dog. We go on long walks. She sits on command. She is completely housebroken.  She\u2019s discouraged from barking at other dogs. And she\u2019s really friendly to people. Walks right up to people and makes friends, and she\u2019s very popular in the neighborhood.    \n\nThere are nice ones. You just hear about the bad ones.  My neighbor has two psycho chihuahuas who bark insanely every time they see my dog or any other dog. Everyone hates them.", "See now I know someone with a fine Chihuahua :D\n\nMost owners probably think because they are so small they need no training, even tho at times they are more annoying than big ones. I especially love when people carry them around as if they are a handbag.", "She\u2019s still a dog and should be expected to behave herself.  She\u2019s not perfect so we avoid situations where she gets excited or feels threatened. For example, one time I put her in a sling to carry her around a store, and she got defensive when I went up to the cashier, and kept barking and growling. So i don\u2019t take her into situations that she can\u2019t handle."]}
