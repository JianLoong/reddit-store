We hired one (16) that our friends strongly recommended. They love her and showed pictures of activities she\u2019s done with their kids and proof of her being cpr/first aid certified. The only thing is she has a weak immune system so you have to tell her if any of the kids are sick with anything, no matter how small, and she\u2019ll cancel. \n\nWe have an au pair. The only reason she couldn\u2019t work that night was because she can only work a certain number of hours per week and this would\u2019ve set her over. Our au pair had a sore throat the day we were supposed to leave but I completely forgot about having to tell the babysitter until she got to the house. When she got there, I told her that the au pair had a sore throat, it\u2019s probably just a cold, and she\u2019s going to mostly stay in her room. Babysitter said okay and my husband and I left. \n\nThe next day I got a call from the babysitter\u2019s mom, screaming at me for not telling her daughter that someone in the house was sick, that her daughter can\u2019t risk being around sick people, and that she works so hard to limit her daughter\u2019s exposure and protect her daughter and I ruined it out of selfishness. \n\nIt turns out the au pair had strep throat and the babysitter caught it. Her mom blames me but this kid has 6 siblings, she could\u2019ve caught it from anyone in that house. I know for a fact that it was going around my kids school and some of her siblings go to the same school so there is a good chance she could\u2019ve gotten it from her siblings. Either way, the babysitter had ti spend a little over a week in the hospital and her mom wants me and my husband to pay her medical expenses (close to 10,000). She says she\u2019s certain that her daughter caught it from our au pair due to our \u201cselfishness and negligence\u201d and that she\u2019s willing to take us to court over this. She also said her daughter is not allowed to babysit for us anymore, which is upsetting because the kids loved her. \n\nMy husband wants to come to a compromise like paying half the bill but I still think that\u2019s her parents responsibility. First, there\u2019s no way she can prove that she got it from us, and second, if her mom wants to let her babysit she has to know there\u2019s a chance her daughter can get sick. My husband is now insisting on paying at least half of the bill so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\nEdit: they do have health insurance. The 10k is the cost after health insurance.", "created_utc": 1672598008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100pwfa/aita_for_not_paying_my_babysitters_medical_bills/", "score": 1257, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I worked in a daycare from 16 to 20 and was always sick and I have an average, healthy enough immune system. You should have warned the babysitter well in advance, not after she arrived and felt pressured to stay. It's often hard for kids to tell adults \"no\". \n\nI don't think the parents have a case here if it went as far as  a courtroon. They can't prove she got sick from your home. I would consider doing something as a kind gesture since you were wrong for not warning her far enough in advance, but not paying the full $10K. Surely a child that sick has some kind of insurance coverage for for their many illnesses and hospital stays.", "Did you honestly \"forget\" about your au pair being sick, or did you just not tell your babysitter until the very last minute because you knew she would have to cancel?

If I had the money, I would pay something toward them, but I\u2019d consult a lawyer first to see if that\u2019s considered an admission if guilt.

Legally it might not be on you, but morally and ethically you are the bad guy here.", "Whether or not you need to pay legally or how much you should pay is a different discussion entirely, but your lack of empathy and clear disregard for the babysitter's wellbeing makes this a clear YTA. You knew the babysitter - a minor - couldn't be around sick people but you put her in that situation anyway. As a minor in your house, you are in fact responsible for what happens to her under your roof. To just shrug off the risk you put her in because she has siblings is BS. You don't know what precautions her family takes at home to keep her safe. Even if the au pair stayed in her room, your kids were obviously exposed to the sick au pair and then exposed the babysitter. You can't prove she got it at your house but you certainly did not seem to care about the babysitter's wellbeing nor did you take any precautions to protect her.

The one who had a sore throat was locked in their room and did not spend time with you babysitter so it is VERY unlikely that there is a chance that she would have caught it.

The babysitter got this infection from somewhere else!", "you knew her immune system was comprised and yet basically waited until you were walking out the door to tell her that people in the house are sick?? so i'm not sure if you're the AH for not wanting to pay her medical bills but YTA for the fact she got sick in the first place because when you know someone's immune system isn't great then you should absolutely tell them if there's something that'll put them at risk. also in general the way you wrote this sounds so victim-blamey and AHholish it's ridiculous omg", "YTA.  Christ on a cracker.  People Have learned nothing from the pandemic.  It doesn\u2019t even matter that the babysitter was immumodefecient.

That alone makes YTA.\n\nBut yes. Your husband is absolutely right.  You should split the bill, AT MINIMUM!

You broke that agreement. \n\nIf none of her siblings had strep, she likely caught it from your au pair.", "I'm going with YTA, because you knew the au pair was sick, and you only informed your babysitter when she was already there and exposed. You knew in advance that she has a weak immune system and needs to be informed when there is a sick contact. Also, this was an elective and fun outing for you and your husband. So you easily could have cancelled.\n\nI get that this is expensive for you, but think about if this was your child. This girl had to spend *an entire week* in the hospital! Over something preventable! I think if this happened to one of your children, you'd be just as angry as your babysitter's mother.\n\nRegardless of the monetary outcome, it definitely seems like the right decision for her not to babysit for your kids, since doing so one time cost $10k and *a week in the hospital*.", "Yta, you should have informed the babysitter and let her decide whether to put her health at risk or not.

She is capable of making choices for herself. She had an opportunity to say no thank you when OP told her there was a sick person. That being said I can imagine she felt awkward and didn't know what to do so did what most ppl do and go along with it to avoid making a scene.\n\nFor this reason alone I agree with the husband and pay half", "If the babysitter was there at night and sick the next day, that would be a very short incubation period for strep throat.

At that point, the babysitter could have said \"No\" but she didn't. She decided to stay.\n\nI will give OP the benefit of the doubt with this being the Holidays, things being hectic, planning, etc, so she could have forgotten about the sore throat. I don't always remember someone's throat hurting. If the Au Pair wasn't actually sick, I probably would have just forgotten all about it, as well.\n\nWithholding that kind of information, on purpose, could have actually killed the babysitter since she's so immunocompromised and I just don't think someone would risk someone's life, on purpose, just to go out. That's a horrible thing to say about anyone.\n\nAlso - she *could* have gotten it from anywhere. It did not have to come from the Au Pair, just because the Au Pair has it. Strep throat is spread through contact or from being in the line of fire when someone with strep sneezes or coughs around you and it gets on you - called \"respiratory droplets\".\n\nThere are also \"strep carriers\" which means that they carry the germ but they are immune to it, however, they can spread it to others.\n\nThere is a plethora of ways the babysitter could have gotten strep and doesn't have to be the Au Pair, just because she has it. If she wasn't anywhere near the Au Pair, didn't touch her, drink after her, etc - she probably didn't get it from her. Her symptoms may have just started after she left. It can lay dormant for a few days before the symptoms occur.\n\nSince there is a *chance,* be it very small, that she got it from the Au Pair, then yes, OP should offer to help pay a *portion* of the medical bills but to expect, no **demand** that OP pay the full cost, is not reasonable and shouldn't even be entertained.\n\nSo, no, OP is NTA for not wanting to pay the entire bill but if they don't come to some sort of a financial compromise, OP will then waltz into AH territory.\n\nEdit: Removed a sentence as it stated the same information twice.", "They do have insurance.

If one of their kids wasn\u2019t feeling well but didn\u2019t immediately disclose it (because kids are well\u2026 kids!) and the babysitter got sick, would the mother still be calling in a rage with a demand of $10,000 for medical costs??", "If she has a weak immune system, what is she doing babysitting in other people's homes?

As a teen there are not a lot of other jobs she can do, restaurant, customer service, all this puts her at risk. Unfortunately chronically ill people have to make that choice for themselves and if they choose not to protect their health by going into an inappropriate line of work they should take responsibility for that choice.

The size and value of the workplace determines the value of insurance that they have access to and can offer their employees. Smaller companies and some specific types of companies do not have to offer health insurance at all for their employees, so then the employees would have to buy insurance through theis state, whatever plans and options were available in that particular state. \n\nMost employers pay a portion of their employees health insurance cost, and there are two tiers: individual and family, and family costs the employee more, but not the employer. \n\nEven WITH health insurance there are copays (amounts due by the employee at the time of the healthcare service) and there are 'out of pocket' amounts, usually in the several thousand dollar range, that the individual is expected to cover before the insurance will cover the excess. \n\nSo even with insurance, a health care incident like a week in the hospital, can easily cost a family 10 or 15k - and hospitals generally expect that to be paid immediately. \n\nIts horrid.", "I'll try to answer as much as I can in order. Yes, the company absolutely affects the quality of care. The breadwinner ideally is provided a variety of options, but they typically cover the entire family. This may be different in families with more than one working parent, which is basically the norm now, as they would be offered a different variety of insurance plans by their respective employers. As far as I know companies don't discriminate based on what health insurance the employee will purchase. Insurance and \"benefits\" are heavily considered by people looking for jobs assuming they're in a field where that's an actual option. Mental health is very rarely covered, imo you're pretty lucky if it even covers dental/vision/etc for a decent price. Also worth noting tons of jobs don't offer insurance at all and people are left to buy it on their own, which sucks because insurance agencies are incredibly predatory.", "Yep pretty much.  It's why some of us are legitimately Better off unemployed too.  So long as I have no job I'm on government medicaid and my copays max at like 5 dollars for almost anything (most are free).  If I went and got the kind of jobs that over 5 years unemployed offers I'd get terrible health insurance that would crank those co pays to a few hundred to thousands of dollars.  Which I'd be expected to use my minimum wage paycheck on.  Granted I'm fighting for disability due to other issues.  But I've met people here who just flat out can't afford to be employed.  \n\nAs for what it includes that's up to the individual plan the employer goes with/offers.  Some do, others don't.

It landed her in the hospital. \n\nAnd if exposure to a *common childhood illness* can reasonable land an adult with an in patient hospital stay, that person should not a baby sitter/work in daycare/be a preschool teacher/etc", "Oh, I totally agree that OP should\u2019ve told the babysitter in advance and that not doing so makes them an AH. If it were me and I honestly forgot to tell the babysitter in advance I\u2019d send her home in a taxi/Uber that I paid for. But it\u2019s impossible to know with 100% certainty that a child *isn\u2019t* about to develop symptoms of some kind of illness or other, so problems like this could always occur even if the parents weren\u2019t AHs."]}
