You actually thought your other siblings would do all the planning/organizing and all the paying? Come on.\n\nThat being said, she should have explicitly asked for a budget before finalizing anything.  But $300-ish bucks doesn't sound like much to me, for a parent's 50th anniversary that you didn't have to do anything for aside from show up.", "YTA\n\nWho did you think was going to pay for your parents anniversary party that their children are clearly planning / hosting? You are being intentionally obtuse.", "YTA - you didn't bother to contribute any effort of planning but you were kept in the loop at each step of the way.   Your objections are kind of pathetic, you knew this party was going to cost something and that you had 9 months to save and you agreed to that.    This is not a very expensive party as parties go.\n\nAre you generally a passive person?  Are you poor relative to your siblings?  At what point did you think it would be good enough for you to just show up after not doing anything at all?", "> At one point gifts ideas were talked about and her response was the party was the extent of her gift.\n\nIf the party was her gift, then why are you being asked to contribute? Also, at what point did the trip get turned into a party? Did anyone ask you if you could/wanted to contribute to this party?  Or wanted to be a host? It seems her payment ~~demands~~ emails came through easily enough, but not the ones asking if you want to contribute or for your input?", "To clarify\n\nMy immediate family all live in the state of Texas. My parents and sibling live northern Texas and I am in  southern Texas it a 4 hour dive to where the party is being held. I am having to take days off work to go this party that i was just basically a guest with the amount of information given to me . \n\nWhen  this started in march i heard it would be a small gathering. Yes i was under the impression it would intimate with only family and a few friends . Either my patents new home or my sister property where she has held other family gatherings. I had no problem helping out with it if she had asked.   I was planning on being there early to help set up. However i did not expect that what i though was supposes to a smaller gathering would cost nearly $1000 total and over $300 for each sibling. Sure it is not a lot of money and yes i could pay.  however my  question here is Am i the ass for confronting her about not talking with me about pricing and budget before she planned an entire event with little to no input for all siblings.", "Info \u2014 If y\u2019all agreed then why didn\u2019t you start saving after you discussed it back in December?", "YTA\n\nYou mentioned having 9 months to save for the East Coast trip - why would you plan to pay for that but then be blindsided by paying for a portion of the new revised plan?\n\nAlso, you are one of three children - it makes sense that you'd all split it, regardless of who planned more... If anything, you should be paying a larger portion because you didn't contribute to the planning. Maybe sister could have communicated better, but it's not like she's asking for thousands of dollars - it's a few hundred bucks for a once in a lifetime celebration.", "YTA I read your text and I was expecting to see an enormous bill\u2026you weren\u2019t bothered trying to do your share of the arranging or the planning \u2026you were just going to fly in and attend a fully organised and free party. I\u2019m guessing your sister\u2018s side of this story would exact opposite of yours.", "It sounds like you agreed to the party, and you are the one who chose not to involve yourself; she didn't shut you out of it.

It's your parent's 50th anniversary, and you agreed to help out. You are acting blindsided by it, when you knew it was coming.  \nDropping the price on you 2 days before the party after you had little involvement is also an AH move, but to quote Fight Club \"You choose your own level of involvement!\"\n\nIf the price was that surprising to you just ask if you can pay her back a bit at a time.", "Yes, you are the asshole.\n\nI understand not everyone makes a lot of money, but 300 dollars for your parent's 50th bday, shouldn't be that bad for a 28-year-old human. Even if you have to use a credit card. And you said you had 9 months to save? You couldn't save $300 in 9 months? \n\nAnd not paying to help out in any way makes you an asshole. You could have told them what you could / couldn't afford when everything was getting planned. It also sounds like you didn't attempt to be involved, you just answered the questions asked. Didn't ask any of your own, your mistake.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like they did you a favor. You didn't have to do any of the planning work, and only had to for over a bit of money for the people that raised you.\n\nIf your car broke down tomorrow how would you fix it? Most repairs cost around 300-500 at a shop. Would you ask your parents for money?\n\nIf you are 28 and can't afford a 300-dollar bill, then that is your fault. Not your siblings. I'm sure you spend that much in a few weekends.", "INFO When you all agreed to the trip 9 months ago was there any communication about saving for it? or did you assume it was not happening? \n\n>However in March of 2023 my sister sent me a text with a save the date picture.

If you wanted to help plan, you should have said, hey, I want to help, but you were silent.", "NTA.  She should have opened with the fact that she was planning this party and that she was hoping the three of you could share the costs.", "NTA for one reason - You never committed to paying any specific amount.", "NTA. She should have made sure you agreed and options for any input rather than blindsiding you the last minute. However, her mentioning that the part was the gift should have had you question what she meant.", "NTA. She had plenty of time to discuss money with you but she chose not to.\n\n>She said $966 is a drop in the bucket\n\nShe won't have any trouble paying for it in that case.", "ETA.\n\nI obviously don't know your siblings but it's painfully obviously that you have your priorities elsewhere. In fact it sounds like you want nothing to do with it, but had to because of peer pressure. Been months, you couldn't have sent a text to ask what's going on? How are things going? Can I help in some way? \n\nYour siblings are also assholes for not including you and outright assuming you're a willing participant.", "NTA, and if they expected you to pay your fair share, you should have had a fair chance of the planning. I will add that if the cost is reasonable and they didn't spend money foolishly, go ahead and pay your share to avoid problems at what sounds like could be a fun family time.", "YTA - You're complaining about $322 as your share, which is a lot less than I would have expected. (Hell I was just at a bday party where a freaking cake cost $250). Your siblings kept you in the loop, and did not ask you to do much, NOR DID YOU VOLUNTEER. I think you got away pretty lightly. A 50 year anniversary is a pretty big achievement!", "NTA, but I would pay $322 in a heartbeat to not have to do the planning", "What the hell is even going on in this story? Who lives in Texas? Texas isn't 4 hours from Virginia. A local party... Local to who? Did you start saving money for a trip east in December and stop when it was changed in March? Do you still have to travel to get to this \"local\" party? I'm leaning towards NTA but only because I can't even afford to be alive anymore. If someone gave me nine YEARS to save up $300, I couldn't do it right now. If you're planning a party and planning that the cost will be split 3 days, I think all 3 parties should be notified of that BEFORE planning begins and the planner should keep everyone informed along the way how things are adding up so that if the others can't afford it, the planner can decide if costs need to be cut or if they're willing to cover what the others can't afford so they can throw the party they want... But you're so bad at giving details as to what happened here that I'm not sure that you weren't informed along the way. What a mess.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
