I had no problem helping out with it if she had asked.   I was planning on being there early to help set up. However i did not expect that what i though was supposes to a smaller gathering would cost nearly $1000 total and over $300 for each sibling.

(Hell I was just at a bday party where a freaking cake cost $250). Your siblings kept you in the loop, and did not ask you to do much, NOR DID YOU VOLUNTEER. I think you got away pretty lightly. A 50 year anniversary is a pretty big achievement!", "NTA, but I would pay $322 in a heartbeat to not have to do the planning", "What the hell is even going on in this story? Who lives in Texas? Texas isn't 4 hours from Virginia. A local party... Local to who? Did you start saving money for a trip east in December and stop when it was changed in March? Do you still have to travel to get to this \"local\" party? I'm leaning towards NTA but only because I can't even afford to be alive anymore. If someone gave me nine YEARS to save up $300, I couldn't do it right now. If you're planning a party and planning that the cost will be split 3 days, I think all 3 parties should be notified of that BEFORE planning begins and the planner should keep everyone informed along the way how things are adding up so that if the others can't afford it, the planner can decide if costs need to be cut or if they're willing to cover what the others can't afford so they can throw the party they want...

That\u2019s lowest common denominator effort. $322 is a bargain. Thank your sister for all her hard work on coordinating everything, show up on time with a smile on, and give her the money.", "Yes, YTA. Either pay up or don\u2019t go to the party.", "Exactly,   if my sister  suggested buying a new TV or computer for my mom and she did all the shopping...I'm happy to send my share of the cost", "As a fellow youngest child, it's time to grow up.\n\nIts never been the intention for it to get this way, it happens naturally when growing up. The older sibblings have to organize or remember important dates, and you're the younger sibbling so not yet too involved. And an automatic pattern emerges. They had to remember the date last year, so they do it again. You didnt have to think last year, so before it is on your radar they mention it to you. Without older siblings you'd be remembering it, but it never does because your sibblings are always first.\n\nBut you're grown up now. You can no longer just wait for your sibblings to organjze everything. You have to involve yourself.\n\nGentle YTA for not realizing that you have to step up!", "The simple solution here is to TALK TO HER, preferably when you give her the $300. Just tell her you are glad she thought of the party but wish she had been more clear at the beginning that she needed you to pitch in. Especially since she said the party was her gift. If you knew it was a joint gift, then you would have done more to help because now it makes you look lazy. (I am not saying you should feel lazy, but you might get this accusation from others.) \n\nI am saying NAH because it is really a miscommunication. Both sides thought it was obvious what was/wasn't happening.", "Right now I\u2019m leaning ESH. I try your point she just did everything and didn\u2019t communicate with you, didn\u2019t even try to engage you. And it seems more conversation happened with your brother than you. I would definitely be frustrated. \n\nBUT, communication goes two ways. You had a lot of opportunities where you could have asked if she wanted or expected your participation or could have said that you wanted to be included in the planning and you didn\u2019t. You were happy to coast and not have to do any of the decision making then, so it\u2019s very disingenuous to complain Shout not being included now. \n\nHonestly, it makes me wonder if this dynamic is common in your relationships.", "So an even dumber thing to be mad about then? If that\u2019s the real reason she is upset, then she is even more in the wrong. I would say get over it, and enjoy the night with your family. Don\u2019t be \u201cthat\u201d family member.", "Not to mention most would offer to pay more to make amends.", "I do hope OP reads this comment, because it is accurate and helpful.  The youngest doesn\u2019t realize how much more of the mental load/heavy lifting older siblings do but at a certain point you\u2019ve gotta be an adult yourself and not just the youngest sibling", "Can't believe I had to scroll this far down to see this. From the comments the original trip was just a vague idea not a plan. The sister then arranged the party without making clear to OP he was expected to chip in. So OP is understand perturbed when his sister asks for $300. It's just bad communication. Sister could have been clearer but OP could have clarified.", "That\u2019s what bothers me the most."]}
