She\u2019s not a bad kid at all but can be a little much at times. She also doesn\u2019t understand social cues and doesn\u2019t like playing with other kids as they often wind her up as a \u2018joke\u2019 so she stays at our mum\u2019s side- but she\u2019s usually very well behaved and will play quietly or colour in her books, etc. \n\nMy uncle (John-30s) is childfree and pretty much all the kids/young adults have a story where he\u2019s said or done something to deliberately make us upset. He told my cousin that Santa, the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy aren\u2019t real. He once found a horse skull in the woods and told my other older sister (who was 8 at the time) that it was a unicorn skull and it died because she was being annoying and talked too much. There\u2019s many more examples, but those are (imo) the worst. \r\n\nWell, he hates Jane, particularly, the neurodivergent aspects of her- like her sensory food issues or getting over-stimulated. He says it\u2019s just her looking for attention when it\u2019s clearly not. I recently overheard him complaining to his new girlfriend (Lucy) about Jane at a smaller family dinner. I didn\u2019t hear the whole thing but Lucy said something about making out on the pier and John says \u2018no. Jane will be stuck to my sister\u2019s side like always. Should probably dump her in the lake or something.\u2019 \r  \nNow, I don\u2019t actually truly believe he would do that, but I did believe he would go out of his way to do something to Jane so I told my family after everyone left. My mum agrees and has said she\u2019s never gotten along with her brother and doesn\u2019t know why everyone puts up with him. \r\n\nShe told some other family members the next day who don\u2019t think excluding my uncle is a good idea. It got back to John that this was being discussed and he flipped out and said I was trying to embarrass him in front of his new girlfriend.

The children shouldn\u2019t be punished by being unable to see other family members by not attending family functions where he\u2019s present.
