I'm healing and the rest of my family are healed because we looked for help outside traditional medicine for an issue it wasn't able to cope with. We've also had a lot of success as a family with using natural remedies for more first-aid/home care type stuff. Chiropractic care has made a huge difference with my severe headaches, growing pains for my kids, some issues with my husband's knees/joints, etc.\n\nBUT! Natural approaches can not fix all things, and they're not for everybody. And there are definitely times when ignoring medical advice in favor of some natural approaches are truly dangerous.\n\nI have a father with type 1 diabetes.

I do have a friend who was diagnosed with type 1 as an adult, and she does a lot more with her diet to try to improve her symptoms and overall health, but that is in addition to the insulin, not in place of it. Diet and natural remedies will not cure type 1 diabetes. Insulin is literally a miracle drug. \n\nSometimes diet and lifestyle changes, and some natural  treatments may improve some autoimmune issues, or at least help alleviate symptoms, but meds may also be necessary, and there's nothing wrong with needing/using them. \n\nBottom line, your health decisions and approach to wellness are your own, but your son and DIL get to decide how best to handle your granddaughter's health and wellness. You really shouldn't be talking to your granddaughter about treatments for conditions you don't even understand fully behind her parents' back.

They get taken to and from practices by their au pair or nanny, and my sis can be there to cheer on the events and help them practice at home.

Your son prefers to go to to the office, which may be for many reasons (required in-person meetings, efficiency, focus, being available for your team).  Putting off certain things that are better done in person is fine for a day or two (or sometimes even a few days a week), but oftentimes it cannot, or is not recommended to, be the best style for many people. \n\nSecondly, is Maria doing other things while most of the kids are at home? Like being there in the morning to prep the kids for school, or prepping lunch or doing laundry in advance of them coming home?  Or being available for emergencies during the school day? Your son cannot do any of these things if he is also working from home in the mornings.  Given that they have kept Maria on, even knowing the option he has of staying home, I am sure that there is a reason for it.

The medications seem to improve every 5-10 years, but yeah the essential oils and gummies will not do crap.

Oh, what's that? You don't see it happening, because your quality of life would decline? Yeah, same here. The last time I was insufficiently medicated, I spent the better part of the year on a couch. You don't want to be brought down by your condition? Neither do I.\n\nWith family - especially my mother - I tend to throw in a \"You've known me my whole life.

My husband is type 2 bipolar, he finally got properly diagnosed and on medication. The change is incredible. He used to curl in on himself 2-3 nights out of a week, hating everything and wanting to die.\n\nSince he's been on medication I can't remember the last time he was like that. Now he's more likely to come home in a good mood, singing and dancing like when we first met.

Just in that regard MJ can do a lot for people. \n\nWhen I went through my med unit and my own rabbit hole it seems like within the last 40 or so years that is when the medical community has had major break throughs.

I wonder if it's kind of like how some people have covid with just respiratory symptoms and some people have GI symptoms.\n\nUntreated strep can turn into scarlet fever, but sometimes you can also just skip straight to scarlet fever without having strep symptoms first. This happened once when I was in middle school, and honestly, it was a lot better than normal strep throat--I just had a rash and got to miss a day of school. \n\nSo, probably another part of why we don't hear about it as much these days is that with antibiotics for treatment it's just not a very big deal.", "Big fruit runs Australia, that's why we have the Big Banana and the Big Pineapple.", "Yeah, my mom is T1, and the number of straight up fucking *stupid* shit she used to hear from one of my aunts (until we all collectively went no-contact) was astounding. \n\nNo, aunt dumbass, cinnamon/turmeric/keto/paleo/yoga/whatever MLM horseshit you\u2019re peddling this month will ***NOT*** cure an autoimmune disease.

It can develop alongside or following the onset of strep throat symptoms.", "EDS? Yeah same thing happens to me. Oh or that I should just increase things to produce collagen. Then I end up saying that I produce enough, it just doesn't work correctly.\n\nOoh, or when I was in a tea shop asking about ones with anti-inflammatory ingredients because I'm allergic to NSAIDs a customer started telling me my body was just rejecting poison so it's not actually a bad thing. I shut her up when I said the base of aspirin is willow bark and I'm allergic to both willow and aspirin. The owner of the shop just nodded when I said that. I loved going there because she and I have the same beliefs where natural things can often help (such as a tea blend that reduces inflammation helping with my aches a bit) but also knowing that can't fix everything.
