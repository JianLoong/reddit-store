I'm healing and the rest of my family are healed because we looked for help outside traditional medicine for an issue it wasn't able to cope with. We've also had a lot of success as a family with using natural remedies for more first-aid/home care type stuff. Chiropractic care has made a huge difference with my severe headaches, growing pains for my kids, some issues with my husband's knees/joints, etc.\n\nBUT! Natural approaches can not fix all things, and they're not for everybody. And there are definitely times when ignoring medical advice in favor of some natural approaches are truly dangerous.\n\nI have a father with type 1 diabetes.

I do have a friend who was diagnosed with type 1 as an adult, and she does a lot more with her diet to try to improve her symptoms and overall health, but that is in addition to the insulin, not in place of it. Diet and natural remedies will not cure type 1 diabetes. Insulin is literally a miracle drug. \n\nSometimes diet and lifestyle changes, and some natural  treatments may improve some autoimmune issues, or at least help alleviate symptoms, but meds may also be necessary, and there's nothing wrong with needing/using them. \n\nBottom line, your health decisions and approach to wellness are your own, but your son and DIL get to decide how best to handle your granddaughter's health and wellness. You really shouldn't be talking to your granddaughter about treatments for conditions you don't even understand fully behind her parents' back. Maria was right to mention this to her parents, even if you feel she misrepresented your advice. You've offered your suggestions to her parents, they've rejected it. You need to let it go, as it's none of your business.\n\nIt's also none of your business to decide who they should keep on as a nanny, just because you dislike her. She doesn't work for you. You're being controlling and overbearing, and you need to step back and let your adult son run his own life and take care of his kids as he sees fit (even if I personally think it's kind of ridiculous to have 3 nannies, including over the weekend, and wonder why they had 7 kids if they don't want to actually parent them.)", "I probably see it from a different perspective. I work in childcare, and I see the parents who have lots of kids, who have multiple nannies, and have their kids in daycare, etc. \n\nYes, if you can afford to have the help to get to the \"nitty gritty\" things more power to you! This is a place of judgement though, and I admit I do judge people who hire out a majority of their parenting duties because they are to busy with other aspects of their life. \n\nSure, have someone clean your house. Have someone drive the kids to practice. But at some point, when you are hiring a staff to do most of your parenting for you, are you even much of a parent anymore?\n\nThis isn't a judgement I would say to someone outright, but this is AITA, and my gut feeling is yes, that contributes to my ESH", "OP, here is some food for thought; why does your own son believe a nanny that he employs more than his own mother? What fuck ups have you done throughout his life that he doesn't believe you even if she is lying?", "Okay, now I gotta know. What did she lie about?", "YTA!  It's NONE of your business how involved Maria is.

You have to keep the kid entertained, change diapers, warm up the milk, and at 6 months he's eating solids, so you gotta make his purees... yeah, and between that you have to work. \ud83e\udd23", "Why is it always a chiropractor?!!!!", "I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not really sure how your personal health journey is relevant to this OP overreach.", "SHE HAS DIABETES.  How can \u201cnatural\u201d medicine replace insulin?", ">The thing is some of the meds are not great for you and some of my issues can be controlled without meds via diet changes and avoiding certain things.  \n>  \n>In my opinion if you medical issue that can be controlled or helped by lifestyle change that is the route you should go. That said sometimes you just need to take meds. I just happen to know people on a lot of meds for things that lifestyle changes will fix.\n\nAnd that decision is to be made in consultation with a medical doctor and possibly a nutritionist and/or other health professional... NOT BY GRANDMA!\n\nYTA", "No.", "I can agree with you...but I've also seen it 100% the other way, where the nannies give the parents the chance to be involved a lot more. Without nannies, my nieces and nephew couldn't be involved in even half of their activities.  They get taken to and from practices by their au pair or nanny, and my sis can be there to cheer on the events and help them practice at home. Yep, some parents 100% do pawn off the kids on the nannies but I am not going to assume the parents in this case do. More likely that wealthy kids are involved in equestrian stuff, soccer, instruments, etc. and having nannies lets them pursue those interests.", "His daughter backed the nanny up", "She told my son I tried to get his oldest to stop taking her medicine. I told her if she takes care of herself and lives a natural and healthy lifestyle she can eventually get off of them.

Once they start talking about doing more than that, or any sort of neck/spinal adjustment involving twisting or significant force, they\u2019ve crossed the line and become a danger to patients.", "Most successful of the psuedomedical scam artists.", "So, you have no fucking clue what your son\u2019s daughter needs to manage her serious, multiple medical conditions?", "You are ridiculous.

Like I said, it's not a blanket thing I can say is always the case, but it's what I have seen more often than not. \n\nWhen you get the parents who never pick up their children, never see their art work, don't come to parent teacher conferences, aren't the ones who answer the phone when their child is sick, don't take them to practice, don't come to events at the school it breaks your heart. Most of the time the families who have multiple nannies fall into that category for me, but it's good to hear that there are more involved parents out there with huge support systems!", "DING DING DING!!! Dodging the answer = knows damn good and well it wasn't a lie. Finis!", "Whatever this lie was that Maria and his daughter said about you, that your son believed, again, what have you done to the people in your life that are causing them to tell hurtful lies about you, and that your son believes them over you? I have a feeling you are hugely not innocent in this", "Because it wasn\u2019t a lie. You are arguing over some slight semantics.

Her medical information is none of your business to begin with.", "What medication are we talking here?", "Either way, it\u2019s unlikely she can ever stop taking any of those medications.

I\u2019ve never see one myself, but I work closely with a lot of ortho docs and researchers who refer patients to these particular providers. Often, patients get referred there because they need a particular manual treatment at regular intervals (occipital trigger point releases to reduce occipital migraines, for example), and their insurance companies will only cover PT for temporary conditions (post-knee replacement PT and things like that), won\u2019t cover ongoing PT visits without an end date, and won\u2019t cover medical massage at all. It\u2019s a shitty workaround, and changes are obviously needed, of course.", "Oooh, my mom knows a guy that went to a naturalist to treat his cancer.\n\nOh wait, sorry, she knew a guy. He\u2019s dead now.", "So, Your naturalist\u2019s daughter is not your granddaughter\u2019s doctor. I find it hard to believe an actual MD would give medical advice on a patient she has never seen.

There are benefits from natural approaches to some things. I noticed you mention she's on insulin and biologics.
