Not sure if that would have happened, but it is an effective way to ensure it gets handled. Also, if she sent you the email, she's putting you on blast to everyone else. Replying to the people she chose to include is fair game and a rock solid reason for not bringing it up privately to someone higher up.\n\nEdit: If it was important enough for those other people to get these emails and not ask her to be removed, why is it not appropriate for them to understand what was actually happening? If you \"dragged them into it\" it's only because she did it initially and they never requested they no longer be part of that chain.

Like if you and the other have vastly different ethnic, religious backgrounds etc. \n\n\nAlso, since you have been with the job for a few years you qualify for FMLA.

After two years of annual performance reviews saying Needs Improvement because of problems I was never told about during the year, I got my boss demoted from management for gross incompetence. At the end of that year, my new boss informed me that I was going to get \"managed out\" come Q1 because saving my job would require multiple levels of management and HR to admit I'd been historically mistreated, and it was more expedient for everyone to simply let me take the fall than to try to fix the problems.\n\nYou've just shown a bunch of coworkers not only that Fiona an asshole, but that they had fallen for her deceptions.

Understand why you did what your did. Unfortunately the way you did it made her a martyr.   The more professional thing to do would have been to take all the documentation directly to your big boss and HR.  The result would have been the same. She got fired and rightly so.

In the real world, yes you do.\n\nPeople may be reacting to your emotional state.  You enjoyed smacking her down.  I don't blame you one bit for enjoying it. I see the situation as she bought that smack down and paid for it.  But I have noticed that lots of times people who are seen as strong are not forgiven for clapping back at people who are seen as weak even when the weak people are doing really rotten things.

The CEO/owner should be ripping all of them a new one for that behavior.\n\nOh, and your roommate is an idiot for excusing such harassment and bad behavior.", "NTA, not an asshole at all. \n\nOn the surface, you're clarifying incorrect information that she sent to a particular set of individuals in the company. In the same thread, so only to people who've been misinformed, you corrected her. \n\nOn a deeper level, she was outright sabotaging you and these folks are upset **at you** because her actions were fireable offenses?! It would've cost her nothing to *not* manipulate such delicate information.\n\nIf it's at all possible I would escalate the issue higher since this seems downright conspiratorial against you.

That email makes the entire company look bad (as do hers if they went to customers and that\u2019s why management should have stopped her long ago).

I feel like the NTA responses are coming from people who just like the thought of someone doing something they've dreamed of in their own fantasies, but HR exists for a reason. You didn't need to bring everyone else into the drama. It's unprofessional and unfair to them.", "NTA - Are you working at the Mad Hatter's tea party?

She's extremely fortunate that legal proceedings and or penalties aren't being persued. I sincerely hope she's learnt her lesson after this. What a nasty , mean thing to do to someone", "NTA at all. I've worked jobs with plenty of email snafus like this had to prove myself before too had someone email a customer with my name saying I screwed up (I worked at an electronic corp that worked on military products) and tried getting my boss to write me up for it. I had to go into our computer programs which document what step every single person does for every single circuit board we worked on. Proved I didn't do it that someone who was above me did it. I made sure to cc copy everyone I legally could to clear my name sadly I couldn't email the customer but they did clear my name with that customer. \n\nAnyway your job is your issue and responsibility. You do not owe anyone else anything. She cc'd people everyday honestly if you hadn't copied them all and just left it to her and the boss even she still would've been fired and than it would have been the rumor mill going around. She messed with your job and a lot of others. She can not be allowed to keep a position that effects others that way. The fact she has kids is sad but not your problem. She is an adult who was acting like a child she should've thought about her family before messing around on her own job", "NTA f*ck her. She didn't care that she could've gotten you fired. F*ck her and whoever is on your case about this. One more time because I'm angry from reading this f*ck her. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI always say fine if someone doesn\u2019t like me, that\u2019s fine. But when they fuck with my job then messing with my money? Then everything to keep things \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201ccomfortable\u201d is off the table.

It\u2019s been a kerfuffle around here and while I\u2019m happy to be free of her, everyone (besides my big boss) that received that email is upset with me and felt that it was inappropriate for me to drag them into the situation and that I shouldn\u2019t have embarrassed her like that when I already knew she would lose her job for it.\n\nYour colleagues have a point. While her behavior was absolutely terrible and she deserves to be fired, the way you went about exposing her was also unprofessional and that can come back to bite you in the butt. People will remember that rather than sending the evidence to the boss over her and HR, you made it a public display. The manager who told you you should be ashamed of yourself is wrong and you should report that manager to your boss and HR.", "NTA. Fiona set the rules of the game, and she lost. She's the one who falsified information and committed fraud, and if she tried to hang that on you you have every right to defend yourself. Well done.", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying ETH. She absolutely needed to be reported for what she was doing, BUT be the professional she was not. In this instance you go straight to upper management and show them your evidence. There\u2019s no need to add insult to injury here. You also have to keep in mind your own future at this company. Being petty does not look good at all. Come review time, I\u2019d certainly think twice about how you acted if I was writing your review. \n\nThe best advice I ever received was \u201cwork is not a democracy\u201d. Reporting someone for wrongdoing is sufficient and professional. Replying to all is over the line.", "NTA\n\nSo it was fine for her to humiliate you, probably with the end goal of hopefully getting you fired for incompetence but it wasn\u2019t okay for you to call out her deliberate sabotage and unethical behaviour?", "She got herself fired", "definitely NTA, I don't even get ppl accusing you of being an AH. Fiona has literally been doing the exact same thing to you and now she's finally got what she deserved.", "NTA, dont listen to them", "NTA, she directed the movie, you just played along, I\u2019ve done this at my job many times before, it sure shuts people up and they make sure to leave you alone and don\u2019t fuck with you. Good job, you did the right thing", "Tell them to foff!  Ynta.  Its beyond ridiculusmto say so.  Next one says anything, go straight to hr for harassment,,,you were saving the company koney and liability and boss knows it and appreciates it.  Sounds like he can replace any of them if they keep it up.  So stupid to find out you can get her fired, but they dont think umcan get them fired? Cray cray", "Do not heed your roommate.  You are NTA.  I would also report that manager.  I'm sorry this happened, and good for you! \n\nSo it's ok for her to falsely accuse you to everyone on the email list, but you cannot defend yourself with the truth?\n\nOP.  I hope you can find a better place to work soon.  Hang in there.  NTA.", "ESH.\n\nObviously, she's a huge AH. \n\nHowever, in the workplace you can't be tit-for-tat as then you open up yourself for reprimanding and consequences as well.\n\nYou should have just sent it to your boss and scheduled a meeting.\n\nYour coworkers are correct in that you should not have dragged them into it, regardless of whether it was done you.", "Only reason I say YTA is because you do not bring others into your fight without their permission. Period. You can fight for yourself all you want but you don't cosign for anyone else.", "NTA. You were just making a correction to her email and making sure everyone knew about the correction so you wouldn\u2019t get blamed and lose your job.", "This. I'd be asking everyone else why it was ok for her to do it, but not OP? I'm genuinely curious to know their reasons...", "This was her reputation in her career. Any of those people could years down the line be responsible behind the scenes for deciding if she is competent for a future job position, and if she hadn't corrected it in this way, they would likely think she is sloppy, negligent, and incapable.", "NTA and agree with this. Hitting \u201creply all\u201d pointing out the changes Fiona made to OPs work documents was fully justified because you didn\u2019t add them to the email thread, Fiona did. You needed to get all these eyes on it because then they wouldn\u2019t be able to sweep it under the rug as another person suggested, because it totally could have. It probably made them \u201cuncomfortable\u201d because it could possibly make them complicit as well. Even if everyone on the daily CC didn\u2019t get fired like Fiona, whether they secretly knew she was making the changes or not, they may have gotten some sort of write up from HR on their employee files or become involved in an internal investigation as this is company policy in my field as well as many others. Not knowing something like this was going on for some time can make everyone on that CC look bad. Sorry you had to deal with this OP.", "And do they not realize if he can get her fired, he can get them fired\u2026duh!", "I agree, but to not have said anything before OP caught her out and then call out OP for defending herself is somewhat inappropriate. Especially when OP proved it was deliberate and done with malice aforethought. NTA OP", "then THEY should have said something before OP was able to turn it around.  OP did not put them in the cc line- she replied all.", "They just feel uncomfortable now because they did nothing to stop it. NTA.", "Did you report it to HR before sending the email, and if not was there some reason?", "All good points! I was on the fence about this too. Like I said, I absolutely *love* that Fiona got what was coming to her. The thing that gave me pause was the reaction of these niche industry coworkers and the roommate, who must have more context about the situation. Their reaction is surprising based on the story we\u2019ve been presented with. If I was one of the coworkers I would be eating this up, not calling OP an AH. So something just doesn\u2019t add up. All I can conclude is that in whatever niche industry they are in, people didn\u2019t appreciate the way it went down.", "Right?  Fiona CC'd everyone- if she had not, then the replay all would not have been as widespread. \n\nAnd Fiona fired herself with this brutally incompetent and fraudulent and unethical (and potentially illegal) behavior.  She just wanted to make you look bad- but in truth, she may have committed a crime (at the very least she put the company at some serious risk).", "Or some of them shit talked about OP to others who may or may not have piled on themselves and they are wondering who remembers what they said and lashing out in an attempt to the narrative that whatever was said, OP deserved it anyways, even if the original reason has since turned out to be false.", "I'm glad you'll be out of this toxic environment soon.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a similar position in the future, though, when you're at a job that you want to keep and maybe someday move up at, I do recommend handling it differently. You're 100% NTA but higher-ups hate drama, especially when it's public; it limits their response options and potentially even opens them up to defamation lawsuits. What you did was 100% justified and doesn't make you an AH at all, but it might make you a liability in your employer's eyes."]}
