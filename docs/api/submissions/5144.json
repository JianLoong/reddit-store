Replying to the people she chose to include is fair game and a rock solid reason for not bringing it up privately to someone higher up.\n\nEdit: If it was important enough for those other people to get these emails and not ask her to be removed, why is it not appropriate for them to understand what was actually happening?

Like if you and the other have vastly different ethnic, religious backgrounds etc. \n\n\nAlso, since you have been with the job for a few years you qualify for FMLA.

After two years of annual performance reviews saying Needs Improvement because of problems I was never told about during the year, I got my boss demoted from management for gross incompetence.

While her behavior was absolutely terrible and she deserves to be fired, the way you went about exposing her was also unprofessional and that can come back to bite you in the butt.

Period. You can fight for yourself all you want but you don't cosign for anyone else.", "NTA. You were just making a correction to her email and making sure everyone knew about the correction so you wouldn\u2019t get blamed and lose your job.", "This. I'd be asking everyone else why it was ok for her to do it, but not OP? I'm genuinely curious to know their reasons...", "This was her reputation in her career. Any of those people could years down the line be responsible behind the scenes for deciding if she is competent for a future job position, and if she hadn't corrected it in this way, they would likely think she is sloppy, negligent, and incapable.", "NTA and agree with this. Hitting \u201creply all\u201d pointing out the changes Fiona made to OPs work documents was fully justified because you didn\u2019t add them to the email thread, Fiona did. You needed to get all these eyes on it because then they wouldn\u2019t be able to sweep it under the rug as another person suggested, because it totally could have. It probably made them \u201cuncomfortable\u201d because it could possibly make them complicit as well. Even if everyone on the daily CC didn\u2019t get fired like Fiona, whether they secretly knew she was making the changes or not, they may have gotten some sort of write up from HR on their employee files or become involved in an internal investigation as this is company policy in my field as well as many others.

Sorry you had to deal with this OP.", "And do they not realize if he can get her fired, he can get them fired\u2026duh!", "I agree, but to not have said anything before OP caught her out and then call out OP for defending herself is somewhat inappropriate.

Like I said, I absolutely *love* that Fiona got what was coming to her. The thing that gave me pause was the reaction of these niche industry coworkers and the roommate, who must have more context about the situation. Their reaction is surprising based on the story we\u2019ve been presented with. If I was one of the coworkers I would be eating this up, not calling OP an AH. So something just doesn\u2019t add up. All I can conclude is that in whatever niche industry they are in, people didn\u2019t appreciate the way it went down.", "Right?  Fiona CC'd everyone- if she had not, then the replay all would not have been as widespread. \n\nAnd Fiona fired herself with this brutally incompetent and fraudulent and unethical (and potentially illegal) behavior.  She just wanted to make you look bad- but in truth, she may have committed a crime (at the very least she put the company at some serious risk).", "Or some of them shit talked about OP to others who may or may not have piled on themselves and they are wondering who remembers what they said and lashing out in an attempt to the narrative that whatever was said, OP deserved it anyways, even if the original reason has since turned out to be false.", "I'm glad you'll be out of this toxic environment soon.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a similar position in the future, though, when you're at a job that you want to keep and maybe someday move up at, I do recommend handling it differently.

She deserves everything she got so abandon your guilt.", "Followed her lead. NTA.", "Nta. These were the people that you would have to work with directly on a daily basis. People who are your higher-ups, even if not your direct boss.  Since the things that she was accusing you of messing up were important details that would cost the company money, clearing your name to the people that she had slandered you to was vital imo. Otherwise, she might have just gotten fired, and it got hushed up. All of those people would still have thought that you were lazy or careless at your job, and that could reasonably cost you a promotion or referral later on. \n\nAnyone who tells you that you shouldn't have done that, ask them if they would want the entire office thinking that they were bad at their job. Since they're the heads of department, I guarantee the answer would be no.", "I'm of the mind that if someone calls you out in public then they have chosen the arena in which you will now play in. \nIf you call me put publicly, then I make corrections publicly. \n\nNTA and I would set a meeting with your boss and possibly HR to address how the department heads should have responded when she was harassing you publicly like that. \n\nThere needs to be some trainings.\n\nETA: The only reason they are \"uncomfortable\" is because their silence was them being complicit in her harassment of you.", "NTA.

The other 10% are her friends, and of course they feel bad for her.  But SHE did this, not you.  The very fact that ANYONE told you that you should be ashamed of getting her fired is INSANE.  Even if you had handled it all privately, she would have been fired.  She SHOULD have been fired, she was endangering everyone's jobs.

The fact that those people are upset that you CC'd them when they didn't say anything previously is a big fuck up on their part, too; they had plenty of opportunity to stop something like this, and didn't. More than likely, the lady obtained her position through nepotism or some shit, and all the angry people are the ones that gave her power she ***clearly*** shouldn't have been trusted with.", "Your co workers and roommate are wrong.

Secondly, who knows what would\u2019ve happened if you\u2019d just quietly notified HR and her immediate manager\u2026but I can make an educated case that they would\u2019ve likely quietly fired this woman with a very vague explanation, tried to save her the embarrassment, and hoped the whole thing would blow over. Highly doubt they would\u2019ve defended you or explained what happened to the rest of the team.
