So sorry if some of the details seem a little confusing. \n\nI (mid 20sF) have been with my company for 3 years. I love my job, except one person. My supervisor Fiona, late 40sF. My main boss has said, explicitly, that her being \u201cin charge\u201d of me is a matter of technicality and that I\u2019m free to tell her no as much I need to. \n\nI can\u2019t express how much I dislike this woman. She tries to exert control over me in the most bizarre ways - demanding I change the podcasts I listen to in my closed office because history is sad :(, the way I sort my inbox, that I open excel before access when she likes to do the opposite, the tea I keep in my drawer, literally everything is a critique. \n\nI\u2019ve been more and more willing to tell her to leave me tf alone recently and there\u2019s been a shift in my work quality since then, for the worse. It\u2019s been filled with \u201cmistakes\u201d. Fiona likes to send me an email every morning detailing all of my mistakes from the day before and how hard it would be for her to fix it all while CCing every department head because \u201cmy work technically affects them all\u201d so I get to start my days off with a fun dose of humiliation. \n\nI\u2019ve been so stressed out every day, going over my work 3 times; worrying myself physically sick, going back and checking over and over again until I realized I wasn\u2019t catching any of my mistakes because I wasn\u2019t making them.\n\nI found a hidden part in one of our programs that will list every change made to an entry and by what user and I was finally able to prove that she was going in and fucking with my work. Daily. And this was people\u2019s money, not just trivial stuff.\n\nSo I spent my afternoon compiling a months worth of evidence in a word doc and the next day (Friday) when she sent her lil email out, I replied all and sent it out to everyone she CCd. \n\nShe has to be fired. There\u2019s no way around it, the things she was messing with were *big*. It\u2019s been a kerfuffle around here and while I\u2019m happy to be free of her, everyone (besides my big boss) that received that email is upset with me and felt that it was inappropriate for me to drag them into the situation and that I shouldn\u2019t have embarrassed her like that when I already knew she would lose her job for it. I\u2019m equally annoyed with them because they were just fine with Fiona embarrassing me every day, never said a single word about it but now you suddenly all care about privacy and dignity? One of the managers told me I should be ashamed that she\u2019s losing her job when she has children to feed but I would lost my own job if she continued so I feel just fine about her getting fired. \n\nI was talking with my roommate about the situation and she said my coworkers were right and I was an asshole to make everyone uncomfortable by including them but I was just so fed up and it feels like some real selective outrage on their part.", "created_utc": 1671477264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zq0n9h/aita_for_publicly_embarrassing_my_supervisor_and/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were just following the standard she set.", "NTA. When someone is doing something that might get you fired, all bets are off. Sometimes having a lot of people know about an issue is the way to ensure it doesn't get swept under the rug. Not sure if that would have happened, but it is an effective way to ensure it gets handled. Also, if she sent you the email, she's putting you on blast to everyone else. Replying to the people she chose to include is fair game and a rock solid reason for not bringing it up privately to someone higher up.\n\nEdit: If it was important enough for those other people to get these emails and not ask her to be removed, why is it not appropriate for them to understand what was actually happening? If you \"dragged them into it\" it's only because she did it initially and they never requested they no longer be part of that chain. For all you know, that's valuable information for them as part of that daily email.", "NTA She is sabotaging your work and harming the company. What did the big boss say about all this? Is she definitely being fired? If so, she deserves it!", "NTA, you needed witnesses.", "My first thought is none of the coworkers wanted to be part of those emails or drama in the first place. but well. then they should have said something now shouldn't they.\n\nNTA. what you did is both important for clearing your name and hilarious. They should feel uncomfortable since they were fine with her dragging you through the mud. \n\nConsequences of their inactions.", "NTA, you didn't start it, you literally just clicked \"reply all\".\n\nAlso, great job finding proof!", "NTA, at all! So this Fiona fabricated mistakes to publicly humiliate and bully you, and pointing it out makes you the bad guy?? The others are almost as bad to want you to sweep it under the rug tbh, I'd be considering my employment options elsewhere if its possible", "She tried to shame and embarrass you publicly.  You responded publicly.  NTA at all.  It seems to me if you had followed proper channels, I doubt should would have been fire.  She would have been talked to, or written up, but that is it.  You made sure the issue had to be addressed.  NTA.", "NTA, I guess she\u2019s in the find out stage of the fuck around, everyone that got the email from you also got the emails from her.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry for your situation. You're absolutely in the right here, and unless you're hiding something from us, it's really awkward that people are taking her side.", "NTA\n\nI don't see the issue now when it wasn't an issue before. I would suggest looking for a new job though. I don't think you did anything wrong, but that level of bad blood in your office from higher ups is not a good thing", "NTA. She dished it out, but she can't take it. She had no problem humiliating you on a daily basis and creating a hostile work environment for you. All you did was reply to her antagonism with proof that you did not screw up as she falsely accused you. I'd still go to HR and file a formal complaint against her, and maybe even talk to an attorney for her written defamation. She was actively trying to get you fired by publicly lying about you. She deserves to get fired and more. She's a serious AH.", "NTA it was okay when she was targeting you and doing it to you. They are hiring behind the clutching of pearls becuase now they know you can check on certain things and call them out on it. They are scared that they are going to get fired.", "I am completely unable to be unbiased on whether Y are the AH because I am just completely thrilled that you finally got to stick it to Fiona. Congrats OP", "NTA, so her bullying you and making your life miserable was fine though? Maybe you could have handled it with more grace, but now your boss can't just sweep it under the rug. I feel like they might have tried to do that if you went any differently about it and Fiona would still be bullying you, just in a different way.", "NTA...I love everything you did and I would've done the exact same thing!", "NTA obviously,  she started the petty war, you ended it,  your boss should have put a stop to this long before now.", "INFO: Is there a reason you didn't talk to the next person up the chain before doing this? It's a pretty extreme response. \n\nYou know, if I was senior in this company and had an employee react like this I'd be concerned about what else they might do. I don't think Fiona should have done what she did, and I do think she needs to lose her job over it, but there are other courses of action you could have tried first.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right. Where was this energy when she was CCing every department head about all the \u201cmistakes\u201d you make every single day? \nWhy was no one like \u201chey Fiona, this isn\u2019t really how we handle it when people make mistakes.\u201d\nHonestly, if I was you, I wouldn\u2019t be sticking around this company, even with Fiona gone. It sounds terrible.", "ESH. \n\nFiona tried to sabotage you and you caught her. F around and find out. \n\nYou should have turned in your evidence privately to her superior and HR. But you jumped straight to the nuclear option, which just brought you down to her level and made you look unprofessional. \n\nThat said. I LOVE that you were able to catch her.", "NTA\n\n...but perhaps a little unwise in putting satisfying revenge above corporate politics. It'd probably have been safer to instead forward her group email up the 'chain of command' only, and include your response.", "Purposefully sabotaging you and then putting you on blast in front of multiple people on a daily basis (over what sounds like pettiness and low self-worth) is honestly psychopathic, and literally illegal if it involves client data. NTA, you need new friends if they think you're TA for exposing someone who was intentionally trying to ruin your career (assuming your roommate is a friend).", "You didn't embarrass her. You blew her azz out of the water. She had it coming. Plus you did the company a solid with your intrepid investigation and detail mining. Just desserts. Let her feast on the shame of her shenanigans being exposed. \n\nNTA. No way. This is funny AH to all of us who have suffered a Fiona at work.", ">everyone (besides my big boss) that received that email is upset with me and felt that it was inappropriate for me to drag them into the situation\n\nFunny, they didn't seem to care when Fiona was dragging them into this.\n\n>I shouldn\u2019t have embarrassed her like that when I already knew she would lose her job for it.\n\nAnd why not? She was fucking with files to make you look bad and should absolutely be fired for that.\n\n>One of the managers told me I should be ashamed that she\u2019s losing her job when she has children to feed\n\nMaybe Fiona should've thought of that before she fucked with things lol\n\nNTA OP", "NTA, you work with a bunch of hypocrites.", "NTA. She set the stage by cc-ing others, you just responded in kind. Even more important, though, she made false accusations and it changed how others saw you. You had every right to defend yourself and perfect your reputation. Mad props for standing up for yourself. She made her bed, now she's gotta lie in it.", "Mixed bag: if you are in the US: depending on your State's \"right to work\" laws you could be fired for the unprofessional email to all. However, keep a side copy of the proof this person had fucked your work up. They really ought to be fired. If they spend so much time each day fucking with you clearly they need more of their own work or are already neglecting their work. \nIn the future definitely take this kid of evidence to HR and the person above the one you have a dispute with. \nSay, you were to get fired for this reaction you could have an EEOC dispute. Like if you and the other have vastly different ethnic, religious backgrounds etc. \n\n\nAlso, since you have been with the job for a few years you qualify for FMLA. Maybe take advantage of any EAP (employee assistance program) benefit you might have. \nIf you are losing sleep, are mentally and physically messed up from all this you could qualify for FMLA (family medical leave of absence) to get yourself taken care of. Also the EAP persons might have been insight and advice than us strangers online.", "NTA.   You do realize that Fiona is sleeping with the main boss?   Nothing else explains why the main boss says you are \"free to tell her no as much as you want to\" as well as the main boss's reaction when you uncover her massive fraud.", "Extremely unprofessional to attach people not in the direct chain of command. You are the big asshole, however funny I find it. You are 100% in the right for getting her fired, have no shame in that.", "Professionally speaking YTA, what she was doing with her emails made her TA and I have a feeling everybody knew it. However you nor only discovering something illegal and that could make the whole company look bad then sinking to her level by broadcasting it, wasn't a good strategy.  You should apologize to each person you dragged in and explain your moment of weakness. I think people will understand and appreciate that you understand what you did was unprofessional and let it slide.", "ESH. She was being unethical but you should have reported it appropriately and avoided the public gossip and drama.", "ESH literally everyone.\n\ndid you handle this properly? no. when you realized what was going on, you should have gone you your boss and to HR and said \"Hey, I found this.\"\n\nalso, your big boss is terrible. they've been letting Fiona send out a daily email listing all of your mistakes cc:ing other people in the office. that should have been shutdown immediately. by your boss and by all of the other managers in your office.\n\nno one in this story made good choices.\n\nso Fiona has kids. that doesn't automatically mean that she gets a pass when she makes bad choices or is a terrible employee or coworkers.\n\njust don't do any of this stuff.\n\nany of it.\n\ndon't.", "Technical ESH. It was unprofessional and potentially illegal depending on your country's laws to out her like that no matter how justified or deserved it felt. This isn't  a self defense case where it's OK to shoot someone because they tried to attack you first. Just on a really pragmatic level this was also a missed opportunity to demonstrate your professionalism. Good bosses would take note of employees who caught a rat and handled it discreetly. Companies do not like people who email blast their dirty laundry.\n\nThat said I can understand why you would do that, that's a very stressful situation to be in.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe this is a hidden opportunity to move up.", "Ok, that makes sense. I do think you should have taken that evidence directly to your boss, rather than sending it to everyone.

Which is the world of Office politics. \n\nExample: \n\nGreetings Fiona, \n\nI hope this email finds you well. Yesterday, you directed that my listening to x particular podcast was disruptive. Though I am in a sound reducing solo booth, I did not recognize this would impact you. Could you please direct what in particular was upsetting so that we can avoid future related concerns. Thanks! \nSign, OP \n\nThen BCC the step up boss on the email. \n\nBoom you got a paper trail started on the harassment done to you.", "Op doesn't say that anyone spoke to them about it, I am assuming they just ignored as it wasn't their business and probs thought lady was unprofessional maybe even had these same conversations with her, and she didn't care...either way broadcasting the illegal actions could hurt people the op didn't intend to hurt. Should have brought evidence to main boss and proceeded that way.

It seems they were already displaying favoritism by never defending OP, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was work-place retaliation against OP for it. \n\nMorally, I think OP is the justified AH.
