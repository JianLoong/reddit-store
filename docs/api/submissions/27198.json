We reassured them that would not happen and I take the role of backup but not primary parent. My husband takes the role of bad guy. I can be good guy.

I told them they could call me anything they wanted as long as it wasn't Miss Jones or ma'am lol.

You're doing what you have to do to make your family work.", "NTA - good for you. Honestly, \u201cDad\u2019s Wife\u201d has fewer connotations than stepmom. It\u2019s a boundary you worked on with his kids in how you can be a partner to him and a parent. I somehow suspect the Bex\u2019s family respects this boundary and appreciates it out of respect for Bex.", "NTA. It can cause confusion from the outside looking in as the average family unit would think you\u2019re the stepmother by definition and thereby the stepmom. \n\nEspecially considering their mother passed away and this is not a divorce and remarried situation, I think it\u2019s a pretty reasonable way to handle a tough scenario.", "No, NTA. You're respecting their wishes! 'nuff said. This is a good thing and while I imagine the gp's meant well, it's not really up to them or their business when it comes down to it.

Your relationship with the kids is your own. Their relationship to their grandkids is their own. They don't get to dictate how you relate to the people in your household. They're (step-kids) old enough to have their own opinions and feelings despite what Nana & Pop Pop think. You're not their mother. They do have a mother who happens to be deceased. How they choose to honor that is also not up for debate by the in laws. Sounds like they weren't that fond of Bex from the get-go.  In laws should also be minding the business that pays them instead of yours. NTA at all. Also sounds like a very healthy dynamic where the kids are respected and now have new siblings to grow with. Best of luck to you all.", "NTA.  As someone who had 2 step-parents, I applaud you and your husband's willingness to listen to his kids and respect their boundaries.  You can have a wonderful relationship with them without needing the \"mom\" or even the \"stepmom\" title.", "NTA. It's refreshing to hear this after so many stories of people trying to push themselves or their partners on grieving kids as \"new parent\". Even though they called you their dad's wife, they will love and respect you so much more than many a stepmom. Good for you for respecting and enforcing their boundaries!! You are doing everything right. The inlaws trying to pretend that their trauma never happened are going to pay the price in the relationship with the grandkids. It's sad, but sometimes you lose a parent. And pretending it didn't happen doesn't help anyone.", "NTA.

I call them by their first names.  \n\nBoth of my kids were young when my parents remarried, I think 3 at the oldest?  Maybe the older one was 4.

You decided to accept this role in their life without requiring more, and your inlaws who are looking at this from a different perspective don't understand it. They need to realize that their input is fine, but their judgement is not, and you need to realize they probably just feel like \"Dad's Wife\" is a demeaning title, or that the kids need a mom. I applaud you for listening to the kids, though.", "NTA - It's non of their business what you get called. As long as you and everyone in your family is good with it then it's really not for anyone else to correct", "NTA Keep rocking your role as dad's wife and mommy!!!  It's none of their business what the kids call you.", "This post sounds more like you celebrating yourself than an interpersonal conflict you want judgment on.\n\n--->Your stepkids are fine with it, your husband is fine with it, and you're fine with it.

So much so that our older son\u2019s kindergarten teacher apparently pulled my husband aside and told him it might be damaging for our son not to call his father by his proper societally assigned role?!

I hate this expectation that the kids call the step parent mum/dad, as if their actual parent isn't important to them in any way. \n\nI think you and your husband handled things with the kids perfectly. It probably helped a great deal in developing a good relationship with them, because you refused to replace their mum and respected their feelings on the matter.\n\nThings could be a little confusing for the younger kids as they get older. But you've handled it great so far, and I have no doubt you can handle the conversation with the little ones when they start asking questions about the mum/dad's wife thing. \n\nThe ILs were way out of line in my opinion, and were extremely dismissive of the kids feelings on this matter. Yours and your husbands, too, for that matter, as you're both happy with the set up you all have. \n\nIt's possible the ILs are just concerned about confusion from the little ones, but it's still not their place to order the kids to call you something they're not comfortable with and you're fine not being called. Forcing these types of issues tend to cause serious problems in blended families like this.

They did not mean ill.", "I call my Aunt's husband \"Aunt's Husband\".  They\"ve been together since before I was born, but weren't married until I was about 10 or so.  I called him Uncle until I learned they weren't married, around 6 or 7, and started off by jokingly saying \"non-Uncle\" and then \"Aunt's boyfriend\". It stuck, and when they got married he asked me if he could be upgraded to Aunt's husband.  For 30 years thats what I've called him.  My cousins (not their kids) told me it was rude, as did other family - he liked it, I liked it.  Thats what I call him.  \n\nAs long as kids are cool with it, and you're happy with it - everyone else can fuck off.  NTA", "NTA", "NTA, good for you defending your stepkids.

Good on you OP, you and your husband are doing this well. Kids are very lucky to have you.", "NTA you respect your husband children's boundaries which is why you and husband will continue to have a good relationship with them when they are adults.\n\nYou can remind the kids with the no pressure caveat that if they change their minds in the future you are open to discuss it with them so they know it's not set in stone unless they decide it to be.\n\nGood on you to tell your in laws off. It's none of their business as long as all 4 of you (you+hubby+kids) are ok with it.", "World's Best Dad's Wife \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02", "A massive hi five from an internet stranger for being an awesome human being and looking after those children with understanding and compassion."]}
