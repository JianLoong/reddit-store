She's been invited to other kids birthday parties but this was the first time that I didn't really know the mom. So we went and she was having a blast but when it came time to eat and have some cake my daughter had brought her own little snack and some brownies to have. This wasn't because she is picky (I mean she is, but it wasn't my reasoning) it's because she has Celiac Disease. \n\nAnyway, the mom got very angry with me and asked what was wrong with her food. I said nothing but pointed out that my daughter had celiac disease and while there were a few things she could eat, the majority wasn't safe for her, especially the cake. She didn't let it go and kept telling everyone I thought I was better than her. Most of the moms who knew me and my friend who's daughter also had celiac (and I also prepared snacks and brownies for) were trying to explain it to her but she was still offended. \n\nSo AITA for bringing my daughter her own snacks and dessert?\n\nUpdate: I just wanted to add something because I am seeing it a lot. While I should have told her when I got to the party (I accept that), I didn't have a way to contact her ahead of time.

What's the alternative?  You feed it to her, and it causes her body to attack her small intestine?\n\nHow could you possibly be TA here?\n\nNTA\n\nI mean, the lesson learned here is that other parents, especially narcissistic ones like the parent of the birthday party, are going to be assholes.  Tell them ahead of time that you'll be bringing your own food.

That Childs mum is an absolute moron.  Hopefully she will get a good lecture off people until it gets through her thick skull.", "NTA but maybe for future reference inform the parents of the birthday child  that she has dietary restrictions and will bring her own snacks so they don't get all offended like this crazy lady.", "NTA - No, there\u2019s no way in which you\u2019re the AH. Even telling her in advance would be courteous, but not a necessity. I feel like telling in advance is more suited for allergies like peanuts, when you\u2019re planning for your child to still eat some of the food provided but want to make the host aware of allergens to prevent cross-contamination. But your daughter wouldn\u2019t be eating the food provided, so it seems unnecessary for her to know. I can\u2019t imagine any well-adjusted adult getting so bent out of shape because a *3-year-old* has dietary restrictions. \n\nThis woman is so self-centered that she cared more about blowing up on you than having a great party for her kid.\n\nDid she badmouth the other mom whose daughter has celiac? Or just you?", "NTA. My daughter has food allergies. We would have done the same thing. We don\u2019t trust other to read labels and guarantee her safety", "As a mom, I would hope for parents to give me a heads up if their kid had a dietary restriction like that so I could try to accommodate for them and also so I could prep my 3 year old for someone bringing a different snack so they didn\u2019t pitch a fit about their friend having something different at *their* party. If they didn\u2019t and brought their own food, that\u2019s still okay though! I\u2019m glad the kiddo won\u2019t be left out of fun treats.\n\nOf course NTA but in the future, maybe just have a quick convo about it.", "Absolutely NTA, but the other mom is for her reaction. My son has a rare metabolic disease, and he always brought his own cupcake, snacks, pizza (if they were serving pizza), or other food. I do agree, however, with others who think giving the mom a head\u2019s up beforehand is a good idea, but I very rarely gave details about his medical condition because that\u2019s private info for him to share. I merely shared he has a special medical diet & will be bringing his own food. I never asked for or expected any accommodations. I primarily told them in advance so that they wouldn\u2019t need to include him as headcount when figuring out how much food to have. (Such as inviting 25 kids but Costco sells 24 cupcakes in a box-you don\u2019t need to buy more.) I can\u2019t believe that mom\u2019s reaction! There was one amazing mom I\u2019ll never ever forget though who always made it a point to either have something he could eat or if the goodie bags handed out as everyone left contained treats, she gave him one with a toy instead. One time she stopped by our house to ask if what she was thinking of sending in for the class for her son\u2019s birthday was something my son could eat. She didn\u2019t want him to feel left out. (My son always had frozen treats stored at school for unexpected parties.) Such thoughtfulness was rare & something I will always remember.", "NTA. You didn't know the mom, so you might have felt awkward asking if she would serve something your daughter could eat. She made a big deal about nothing. It's a far cry from bringing gluten-free food, to thinking you're better than someone. Good grief", "NTA, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. That lady is just one of those people who think everyone is out to get them and view every small incident as a personal attack.", "NTA.  She's 3 and you wisely didn't let her get tempted to eat the cake with gluten. The other mother is... interesting. I'm not sure how having a child with a disease and feeding her in order to keep her healthy means you think you're better than she is.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA, there is a medical necessity.", "NTA. I have celiac. You\u2019re doing the right thing so your daughter is included and doesn\u2019t grow to hate social settings from being left out of the food aspect (which is like 50% of social settings anyway)", "As a mom with celiac disease, you are 1000% NTA. You\u2019re keeping your baby safe. Her response was not justified at all. You did the right thing sending her with GF snacks and brownies. I\u2019m sorry that mom was so hostile. You don\u2019t deserve that!", "AYTA for trying to protect your daughter from a painful flare-up? HELL NO, NTA", "I have a friend with celiac. They regularly bring their own food to gatherings. This woman sounds like one of those people that doesn't believe it's a real thing. NTA", "You are 100% NTA. If anything, the host is. If you have people coming to the party with special diet needs, you take them into account.\n\nFor my daughter\u2019s birthday, we got special desserts for the kids who needed them and made sure they were kept apart so no one ate them. And we made sure they had food too! \n\nIf that\u2019s not going to happen your brownies were a great call. I think this relates to how many people still don\u2019t get that celiacs is a big deal that the host didn\u2019t seem to care.", "NTA\n\nSo many kids have allergies and food restrictions these days, I\u2019m shocked the hostess took it personally.  Once OP informed her of her daughter\u2019s celiac disease, I would have expected the hostess to realise there was no reason to be offended.", "NTA - the other parent is a nutjob.  I think it's wonderful that you took the initiative to make sure that your daughter's needs would be met instead of expecting this other mother do it for you.", "NTA. To get upset over a cake is ridiculous. I wouldnt bat an eye if someone didnt want cake and wanted an alternative they brought because some people also have food allergies, diabetic,etc and some simply do not like cake. If all they wanted was a snack great but im not taking offense to it. If she left no contact info then not your fault. What could she have really done to accommodate your kid had you told her on arrival? Chances are she wouldnt be able to have prepared an alternative anyway", "NTA. My son in law has Celiac\u2019s and he has trouble even eating out with us at restaurants that offer GF options bc of cross contamination. The host was out of line to make such a huge deal about this. My guess is she was super stressed but that doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior when you had a legitimate reason.", "NTA. So many people have dietary restrictions and celiac is not one that has an easy work around. I can see the mom being a bit offended to start with but once you told her why, it shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal. I think calling ahead is weird unless someone has a life threatening allergy that really needs to be understood.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Your child needs their special diet and that\u2019s nothing for her to get offended over.", "NTA", "Of course you are NTA. And who acts like that woman anyway? She sounds really immature. I'd find my daughter new friends.", "NTA, what did she want you to do? Have your daughter be sick or forced to eat food she can\u2019t digest? The other mom just sounds medically ignorant and probably thinks it\u2019s a voluntary choice like veganism is my bet", "NTA. Mama with Celiac here. While it would have been ideal for you to contact her ahead of time you say you didn\u2019t have a way to. As SOON as this woman heard your daughter has a MEDICALLY restricted diet where cross contamination is a problem, that should have been enough. Too many people still dismiss Celiac because when they hear \u201cgluten free\u201d they immediately jump to fad dieting.\n\nYou\u2019re doing what you need to do to keep your daughter safe. You go Mama.\n\n(And give that kiddo a high five for me from a fellow gluten free gal!)", "Absolutely NTA. My husband has celiac and we ALWAYS bring food if it\u2019s an unfamiliar person/situation. And he\u2019s 35, not 3!", "NTA in any way, shape or form. You can\u2019t fix stupid sometimes. \n\nIn the future maybe you could leave a note at daycare for the staff to give to another parent if you don\u2019t have contact info?  You shouldn\u2019t have to jump thru those hoops and involve daycare staff - and what parent doesn\u2019t include contact info on an invite?? But it would provide a heads up. Like another commenter said - kids at that age can be funny if one of their friends gets something different to eat so it is nice to give advance notice if you can. \n\nBut clearly you are NTA.", "NTA. Celiac\u2019s can be EXTREMELY painful when you consume gluten and this mom is insane. So NTA", "NTA. Never feel bad for protecting your kid. If that was her daughter, she would have done the same thing, if not more. If she doesn\u2019t want to accept the fact that some kids have specific dietary restrictions, then let her be and don\u2019t justify yourself to her.", "NTA but the host sure is! You handled a good sensitivity with good preparation. The host mom has some serious issues to 1) interpret a medical need as an offense to her food and 2) go around telling everyone that she\u2019s offended.\n\nGood the other moms understood and supported you, this is a handy screening for basic human decency!", "NTA. I had a couple of friends growing up with varying allergies and they always brought their own food. They never gave a heads up or anything because why would any of us had made a fuss over it once it was explained. At first, we did say \u201coh but we could have made you something\u201d but they all said \u201coh this is just easier, it doesn\u2019t give you any extra work and I know what I\u2019m allergic to, so it\u2019s no extra work for me to grab food from my own house\u201d.", "What's her problem, really? You are NTA for sure", "NTA. Honestly isnt it common knowledge that so many kids have allergies or diabetes or celiac or who know how many other issues.   NOBODY should feel like they hotta control what all their guests are eating. FFS.", "NTA since celiac disease can make people terrible sick", "My daughter chose to celebrate her 21st at home with a dinner made by me. Of the three people invited, two were vegan and one has celiac. Managed spinach and ricotta lasagne, a favourite, but definitely needed a lot of advance notice.", "You're definitely NTA but this is what confuses me. If there was no way to RSVP then the mom didn't know if anyone or everyone invited was coming. That's a horrible thing to do to her daughter. What if no one showed up? She's obviously an unusual mother. She reacted horribly.", "Whenever my daughter invites someone who I don't know that well, I always reach out to the parents to ask if their kids have some sort of dietary restriction so I can accommodate them and have something available for them too. It's ridiculous that she got offended and reacted like that. \n\nI'm truly sorry for her kid, but at least now you know who to avoid. NTA at all.", "NTA. At all. I\u2019ve had kids with celiac and kids with nut allergies at my kids birthday parties. That\u2019s what they do: bring their own snack to have during cake. (I offered to get a nut-free cake, but was declined the offer. I had no idea how to get a celiac-safe cake, so I was relieved when the mom offered to send safe snacks.)", "Of course not! It\u2019s a food allergy! And instead of assuming that the host would provide food for your daughter, you took care of it yourself. You\u2019re a great parent and I\u2019m glad you have other parents on your side. NTA", "Did you let the host know in advance?", "NTA never let your child go around this woman unsupervised. How dense and irresponsible she must be.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but it would have been better to warn the mom ahead of time to avoid misunderstandings. I don't know why she continued to be offended after you explained. Apparently she wasn't listening or didn't know what celiac disease was.", "NTA i have celiacs and i always bring my own food just in case (unless the host specifically says there's gf options). she was out of line and should understand that kids can have allergies and food intolerances.", "NTA. That other mom is insane if she thinks you were being a jerk when you were just offering your daughter food that was safe for her to eat. I would\u2019ve hit her with, \u201cSo you want my daughter to eat some of your cake and then DIE in the middle of your child\u2019s birthday party???\u201d", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t even expect her to make a separate snack for your kid.  You took care of it so as to not give her extra pressure, she should be thanking you", "NTA. I always ask for allergies / intolerances before hosting a gathering, kids or adults. I've had people bring their own food and explain it when giving it to their kids that they're celiac / have allergies / are picky. These kids are three. It's wild she was this upset.", "NTA. People who are this stupid are just not worth worrying about.", "NTA. It is almost always safer for people with food allergies and issues to bring their own stuff. Artificial colors turned my kid into a monster, so I always took alternative treats to birthday parties. Literally no one ever had an issue. This mom is bonkers for taking something like this so personally.", "NTA. That mother was totally out of line. Celiac is a medical problem, no less serious than a kid that can't eat something because of an allergy and she was betraying her own ignorance.", "NTA \n\nBring your own snacks even if your kid doesn\u2019t have celiac disease. You know why? Because the fact that you show up is the important part not what you eat.", "You are absolutely NTA for being cautious about your daughter\u2019s serious allergy. But I think people sometimes miss the social nuances of these situations. Like yes, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong and have zero reason to feel bad, you\u2019re not required to clear your kid\u2019s allergy safe foods with the party host. BUT, just for the sake of maintaining social niceties and not creating tensions where there doesn\u2019t need to be any, I\u2019d make it very clear in the future that you\u2019re bringing your own snacks, and WHY (the most important info to provide)\n\nCertain cultures thrive on feeding people, it\u2019s how they show love and take great pride in providing food for guests. Despite it NOT being your intention, it could have been perceived as \u201clooking down upon\u201d the hosts food, causing them to feel embarrassed.\n\nAgain, your actions were certainly not wrong! But for your own benefit, and ease of future social interactions, have a quick conversation first so the host isn\u2019t on the defensive and making you feel awkward.", "NTA- What kind of mom would be offended by that? You brought something your child could safely eat. If she cared she would have inquired with all the guests about allergies. And then to continue basically attacking you? What a psycho.", "Clearly this is a case of being uneducated about celiacs. Any parent who has any ounce of compassion or empathy would **not** reasonably get upset over a parent bringing a separate snack for a celiac child.\n\nNTA and keep doing you. Good job.", "NTA.  My son had a classmate with an allergy and she had special treats in the school freezer so that she didn't miss out on birthday treats at school.  Her mom sent her to parties with her own little purse of snacks.  All the parents knew and understood this. All the kids knew and understood this.  In fact, the snacks she sent and the cupcakes she made were so good my kid asked if we could have them at home.", "NTA. Ideally it would have been nice to tell the mom before. I would feel awful if I had booked a birthday party and didn\u2019t have anything for one of the guests to eat. I hosted a kid at a birthday party who couldn\u2019t eat milk. Realistically, his parents would have likely brought some of their own food anyway but I could have made the effort to ensure that we had plenty of milk free stuff that hadn\u2019t potentially come into contact with milk so he didn\u2019t feel left out. That said, I would never be offended by a parent bringing food for a kid with allergies just in case. I don\u2019t live with allergies and ensuring that there is no cross contamination so even if I make an effort to accommodate an allergy I can understand a parented wanting to ensure their kid is safe.", "Absolutely NTA. There\u2019s no reason why the host should\u2019ve been offended by this especially after finding out the reason why (a medical condition!).", "NtA.\n \nShould have informed her? Look, you did nothing wrong. A reasonable parent is going to hear that and be fine. ESPECIALLY if you don't have a close relationship with that person. \n\nThis is absolutely strange that she would be upset and says a lot about her personality. I'd be very careful about spending time with her in the future.", "NTA. This is freaking weird behavior from that other mom. \n\nWhy is she trying to control what your kid eats? That\u2019s super odd. Sounds like she has something else going on that has nothing to do with you.", "NTA\n\nWhat else are you supposed to do? Just risk your daughters life because you don't want to upset the host? That's ridiculous! You definitely did the right thing, the other mum is crazy", "Absolutely NTA.

I don't really remember the words, just kind of the tune & hand motions.", "While one can be allergic to both, peanut allergies are different than other (tree) nut allergies.", "To be fair, though, some people with mild allergies do eat this way - just pick out the ingredients they're allergic to.
