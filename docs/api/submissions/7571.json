There are many other solutions to the problem that do not include a thirty year binding commitment to your mother.

Your mom sounds overbearing and incapable of taking no for an answer. Who knows how far she will go to get what she wants!? She might try to impersonate you and use your name without ur consent, and a credit freeze renders that impossible to do.", "NTA, it's fraud. You would be the one signing with the bank and they (most often) require you to live in the house for the first year.\n\nDon't do a fraud. I'm sorry your mom and sister are having such a hard time.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it. You\u2019ll probably just end up with shitty credit. Let your sister who will actually live there use her credit.", "NTA.  OP needs to contact the 3 big credit reporting agencies and put a freeze on her credit.  This way no one (including her mother) will be able to use her name and credit for purchasing a house (or any other major purchase).  I don't think OP can trust her mom to not do this behind her back.\n\nOP needs to remind her mother that if she uses her (OP's) name and credit, that it would be fraud and she (the mom) could go to jail over this.", "NTA - That's a dump truck of red flags. Make it clear that it will absolutely never happen, and for God's sake, lock your credit against new accounts.", "NTA. You Should get the benefit of the first time home buyer incentives when YOU want to buy your own house.  Your sibling is your mother's responsibility not yours.

There are a hundred ways this entanglement could screw OP up in the long term. OP should lock their credit to make sure mommy cannot forge their signature on a mortgage.", "Not only that, a first time homebuyer program requires the actual first time buyer to occupy the house. (I\u2019m in the business). Do not do it, OP would be committing fraud and also since mom needs a co borrower it means she has poor credit. People have poor credit because they don\u2019t pay their debts on time.  I\u2019m guessing mom will have many opportunities to remind OP they are an owner and are obligated to help when mom can\u2019t afford it.

Don't do it.  You'll be on the Note and responsible for the payment.  This could be catastrophic to your credit down the road.  Nothing good ever comes from using your credit to buy somebody else's house.  The selfish and greedy one in this is your mom.", "NTA.  Don't let her use your name and credit.  You need to stop arguing about this.  Refuse to talk about it.  End the call or leave any time she brings it up.  Don't allow her to bring up this issue.", "NTA! I will never understand how people can think that asking to co-sign for them on anything is just a \u201csmall\u201d favor. It\u2019s NOT small, it\u2019s HUGE! My cousin had her father co-sign for private student loans, she\u2019s had her degree for nearly ten years but about 7 years ago she stopped paying her loans back. Now my uncle\u2019s credit is trashed and he was on the hook for paying the loans back. If you do this OP, and your mom doesn\u2019t make the payments, as her co-signer you would be held 100% for paying it when she can\u2019t/won\u2019t. Do not let her guilt you into doing it. Never let ANYONE use your name or credit for their own benefit. It will bite you in the ass! She\u2019s your mom, but she isn\u2019t entitled to use your name or credit, or anything else for that matter. Protect yourself, and don\u2019t do it.\nEdit: typos", "Not sure where you live but if it's in the US, you are often eligible for \"New\" home buyer programs if you haven't bought a home in 3+ years.

The first time homeowner perks apply regardless of your age, and credit-wise it\u2019s never a good idea to put it on a home someone else will live in. Your mother needs to spend the time she rents to build up her own credit.", "NTA your mom sounds entitled and manipulative", "Make sure your credit is frozen as she may try to do it without your knowledge.", "NTA. The only reason to do this is 1. Fraud 2.

What she is asking for is fraud. Also, if she doesn\u2019t make the payments, then you will be on the hook for them. Do not do it!!!", "Nta and it's a terrible idea to give in to her demands. Don't do it OP", "NTA - what she is proposing is actually fraud. She could destroy your credit and affect you when you actually need a loan, your own house, etc.", "OP's mom is even more then grown up, iots her own fault her credit is bad", "This! So much this! Also, Credit Karma is a free site. I suggest signing up for it. That way, if your mother tries something hinky, it will show up on your credit report and you can take action.", "... or move.", "> Kinda TA there.\n\nNope. Mortgage fraud is bad."]}
