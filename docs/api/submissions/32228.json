This invitation was not extended to my husband, who took this as our son attempting to prove a point. He\u2019s my husband and I stand by him, and it is proper that couples should be invited to weddings together. I declined the invitation as we were not both invited. \n\nWhen I told my son, his position was that I can act independently and shouldn\u2019t do everything my husband \u201cdemands.\u201d I made it clear this is my independent choice not to attend without his father. My son claimed he didn\u2019t know I felt that way. I told him I\u2019ve always supported his father, and while he was strict I can see that he also set all of our children on a path for success. My son was deeply upset by this, claiming everything he\u2019s done he\u2019s done for himself as he was on his own at 18 as he puts it. We have a different memory of that time, but I did not want to argue with him and I left to let him calm down.\n\nSince that conversation my daughter has spoken with me warning me that if I want him to continue speaking with me I should apologize soon because she considers him to be very distraught over this.

You have also noted that you are doing this to \u201cstand by\u201d your husband who has viewed this as your son attempting to \u201cprove a point\u201d. I think the point your son is trying to prove is that regardless of what has happened with his father, he still values his relationship with you and loves you, which is more of a show of unconditional love than you claim to have for your son. And you should really reflect on why your husband would want you to miss a major life event of your son that you can never get back and will irreparably damage your relationship with him.

Unfortunately they have not gotten on well in decades, not since my son was a child. It is to the point now that they have not spoken in several years. My son keeps in contact only with myself and his sister. \n\nNow, my son has invited me to his wedding which will take place in the upcoming year. This invitation was not extended to my husband, who took this as our son attempting to prove a point. He\u2019s my husband and I stand by him, and it is proper that couples should be invited to weddings together. I declined the invitation as we were not both invited. \n\nWhen I told my son, his position was that I can act independently and shouldn\u2019t do everything my husband \u201cdemands.\u201d I made it clear this is my independent choice not to attend without his father. My son claimed he didn\u2019t know I felt that way. I told him I\u2019ve always supported his father, and while he was strict I can see that he also set all of our children on a path for success. My son was deeply upset by this, claiming everything he\u2019s done he\u2019s done for himself as he was on his own at 18 as he puts it. We have a different memory of that time, but I did not want to argue with him and I left to let him calm down.\n\nSince that conversation my daughter has spoken with me warning me that if I want him to continue speaking with me I should apologize soon because she considers him to be very distraught over this. It breaks my heart because I love my children unconditionally, and I lost my oldest son last year.

At the same time OP describes the father as strict and the resulting \"structure\" as not curtailing the problem. A lot of times if kids are micro-managed and feel no control it pushes them to rebel harder and in more extreme ways such as attempting to drop out of high school. Heavy rule sets especially those that don't help address the initial problem (in this case a kid disliking school) tends to cause this effect. \n\nSome people also don't do well within a traditional education system and need supports that aren't simply rules but real changes that address things via accommodations.

Placing structure and rules won't give full support.
