I was reluctant, but she told me I could write it all - she just had the basic idea, and I could do whatever I wanted with the story. So I agreed, and I finished it a few months ago. \n\nHere\u2019s where the problem starts. I make most of my income from art commissions, and I\u2019ve designed quite a lot of book covers, so I thought I\u2019d design our cover. She told me to do whatever I thought was best as she \u201chas the art skills of a dead rabbit.\u201d I did a rough sketch, and sent her a photo of it, but that\u2019s when her attitude changed. I had my name, and her name underneath that. Both are the exact same; there are absolutely no differences in terms of size or font. But she didn\u2019t think her name should be below mine\u2026 Or next to mine, or even on top of mine. She didn\u2019t want my name on the cover at all. When I told her that I wrote the entire thing so my name should be on the cover, she started yelling down the phone, saying I wouldn\u2019t have a book to write without her idea, which is true! So I tried compromising by saying that my name can go below hers and be written in a smaller size, but she refused.\n\nNow here\u2019s where I might be an asshole. I told her I wasn\u2019t giving her the book. In the beginning, I asked if she wanted me to send her new paragraphs and/or chapters, but she said she just wanted to wait and read it when it\u2019s finished, which means she doesn\u2019t have a copy. It was her idea, so I\u2019m not going to try and publish the book, but I said she can\u2019t have it. Honestly I felt a little bit like a toddler saying it, and it is such a ridiculous argument to be having, but there was zero mention in the beginning of me ghostwriting. I probably should have clarified that with her, but I never thought to.\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken in a week now, which has been her choice, not mine.\n\nI don\u2019t really think I\u2019m in the wrong, but honestly a part of me is worried I am. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\nTLDR: Best friend of 20 years asked me to write a book based on her idea.

Is this a friendship that makes you happy?  Or is it one where you are always trying to keep the other person happy (and they're not reciprocating the effort)?\n\nEthically/legally, what do you do? Make sure that you password save *everything* in the cloud.  The book.  The manuscripts that show when you started and all the changes you made over time, that show how you wrote and built this book from the start.  Save the texts from your earliest discussions, where she shares the idea and tells you to 'do whatever' and the current texts where she's upset. Even write a memo to yourself outlining exactly what happened.  Store all of this in the cloud.\n\nBecause maybe, just maybe, you will decide to try to publish this book in the future.  Keep all this information because it will prove who said what, and who did what work/participation.  \n\nAnd letting a book manuscript cool on the shelf for a couple years is not a bad thing.  Coming back to it with very fresh eyes can help you do an excellent edit/revision to prepare it for an editorial review prior to publishing.", "NTA, it's ridiculous to think that your name wouldn't be there at all considering you wrote the book.

If not, could have been down right boring if written by the wrong person.\n\nYou see this in comics (manga especially too). Great idea or plot, but then the word play falls short. Or the art is so bad you can\u2019t really follow the story or it feels flat and monotone.\n\nThis is why you see a lot of mangas with two (or more authors) a plot and screen writer and an artist, or a plot creator, screenwriter and an a artist.

If I were to just write an entire BOOK (or article/blog) for a standard rate and then find out that someone else was going to erase all evidence of my brain and labor and take credit for it, I would not give them the files.

They always turn out wildly different because we all write differently and have different takes.

I do not want any of the credit on the front cover if and when we get it published. Nor do I want my name in the dedication section.

Ideas are a dime a dozen -- it's how they're written that makes 98% of the book. \n\nIf this ever happens in the future, be sure to put together an agreement of how money will be split and who gets credit. In fact, if you want to save the friendship (and I'm not saying you should) I suggest that if y'all ever speak again, you ask your friend what the agreement should have looked like before you started writing their idea for them. It could be that, once they've thought about it, they'll realize the fairness of your take. \n\nIf the friendship's wholly broken, maybe you can \"file off the serial numbers\" -- change the significant ideas your friend contributed -- and publish the story.

Or editing. Or any rewrites and tweaks. YOU\u2019RE the one who breathed life into the idea. And that is not an easy or quick task. Unless she paid you to ghostwrite the book than really she doesn\u2019t deserve credit beyond giving you the base idea. \n\nIf you plan to publish I would suggest speaking with someone with legal experience just in case.

His publisher listened, and then said \"okay, you've got a really great setting. but you don't have a plot or characters. come back when you have those.\" \n\nI think about that a lot -- you need a setting, plot, and characters to move your story forward.
