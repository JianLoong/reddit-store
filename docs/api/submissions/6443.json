I was reluctant, but she told me I could write it all - she just had the basic idea, and I could do whatever I wanted with the story. So I agreed, and I finished it a few months ago. \n\nHere\u2019s where the problem starts. I make most of my income from art commissions, and I\u2019ve designed quite a lot of book covers, so I thought I\u2019d design our cover. She told me to do whatever I thought was best as she \u201chas the art skills of a dead rabbit.\u201d I did a rough sketch, and sent her a photo of it, but that\u2019s when her attitude changed. I had my name, and her name underneath that. Both are the exact same; there are absolutely no differences in terms of size or font. But she didn\u2019t think her name should be below mine\u2026 Or next to mine, or even on top of mine. She didn\u2019t want my name on the cover at all. When I told her that I wrote the entire thing so my name should be on the cover, she started yelling down the phone, saying I wouldn\u2019t have a book to write without her idea, which is true! So I tried compromising by saying that my name can go below hers and be written in a smaller size, but she refused.\n\nNow here\u2019s where I might be an asshole. I told her I wasn\u2019t giving her the book. In the beginning, I asked if she wanted me to send her new paragraphs and/or chapters, but she said she just wanted to wait and read it when it\u2019s finished, which means she doesn\u2019t have a copy. It was her idea, so I\u2019m not going to try and publish the book, but I said she can\u2019t have it. Honestly I felt a little bit like a toddler saying it, and it is such a ridiculous argument to be having, but there was zero mention in the beginning of me ghostwriting. I probably should have clarified that with her, but I never thought to.\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken in a week now, which has been her choice, not mine.\n\nI don\u2019t really think I\u2019m in the wrong, but honestly a part of me is worried I am. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\nTLDR: Best friend of 20 years asked me to write a book based on her idea. After it was finished, she tells me she doesn\u2019t want my name on the cover at all, even though I wrote it all, so I refused to give her a copy of the book, and now we\u2019re not talking.", "created_utc": 1672807570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102u89i/aita_for_wanting_to_put_my_name_on_a_book_i_wrote/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no copyright in an idea, only the expression of that idea. In this case, she may have had an idea but you expressed it in writing and therefore own the copyright. Giving her any credit at all is exceedingly generous.", "NTA\n\nIdeas and $1 will get you an item off the dollar menu.\n\nYou did all the work. It's your book. Unless there's a contact stating who gets credit / how royalties are split, your friend has contributed nothing and deserves nothing.", "NTA. Unless she signed a contract with you as a ghostwriter, you undertook the project as an author and authors names go on the cover. I believe you\u2019re protecting your interests by not providing her with any of the text you\u2019ve written, but you also might want to go a step further and speak with a lawyer if you plan on pursuing publication. While I don\u2019t believe you are in the wrong, a situation like with a person like her sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "NTA. Yes, she had the basic idea but you're the one who developed the book, characters, plot, and cover. As you mentioned before, intentionally discussing being a ghostwriter or something similar in future circumstances would probably be a good idea. This book wouldn't exist without the work you put into it.", "NTA- it\u2019s your book. You wrote it. I\u2019m pretty sure that legally it would be yours also. So once you have confirmation on that, publish it anyway (if it makes you feel better, you can put her name underneath yours with a smaller font but I don\u2019t think she should be on the authorship at all). You put a TON of time writing it and deserve to be compensated.", "If your friendship doesn't survive this, then publish the book. You did EVERYTHING and still included her on the title. She didn't even read any of it when you wrote it. Don't show her- she sounds petty enough to steal it and publish it herself. NTA.", "NTA and it\u2019s not childish to withhold your work - you\u2019re not preventing her from writing and illustrating the book herself.", "Ideas are ten a penny. The work is actually putting it on paper in a way that people want to read.   \nYou didn\u2019t steal a patent from her, you didn\u2019t turn her idea into a sitcom. You actually owe her nothing. Having her on anything is because you are nice.   \nIgnore her, and if she starts foaming at the mouth, block her. Unless she is Shakespeare, she didn\u2019t come up with an utterly novel, brilliant, never before told story.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t give her the book. Tell her if she wants to release it without your name on it, she can write it.\n\nCongrats on all the work you did! Sorry your friend thinks she\u2019s entitled to benefit from your work.", "NTA - I think you were being super generous just including her name on the cover.  I would have just put her name in the dedication page.", "NTA. She has no proof it was her \"idea\", right? Ideas are like farts, without the sweat you put into writing it, it would have come to nothing. She contributed like 1% of the book, you contributed 99% and she's trying to cut you out of even that? Hell no.\n\nPublish YOUR book under YOUR name only. And mail her a polaroid photo of your first royalty check. :)", "NTA. You did the work. Also you\u2019ve learned to not do business with friends, and to work out these issues ahead of time.", "NTA, she is.  You wrote it, you do with it what you want.", "NTA. She had the idea but that\u2019s the easy part. You fleshed it out and wrote it down into a full story. It\u2019s fully your work. Don\u2019t give the book. And I think you should try to get it published if you want.", "You did 100% of the work. She had an idea but didn't develop it. She didn't offer to edit, beta read, review, look at the art, do anything an author or an author's support did. Imagine this was a group project at school - two people discussed, one had an idea of a possible angle. Then the other researched the idea, wrote the report, added in all the graphics and arranged for it to be actually handed in. The other refused to turn up after first meeting. How would you split the credit? \n\nThe book would not exist without you. However, she will likely try and destroy it with bad reviews/claims of plagarisn if she can be bothered.\n\nBest approach might be to let it stew for a year or so and release quietly. She sounds lazy.\n\nNTA though you were much kinder than she deserved putting her name on cover.", "NTA - a book is more than an idea, it\u2019s characters, plot, world building. People do t realize how hard it is. If she were to sit down and write her idea out it would probably be completely different than yours. Definitely do NOT give her YOUR book. And idea does not equal a book. You were doing her an incredible kindness by including her on the title and not just an acknowledgment. Getting published is very hard, so congratulations. If she wants to be a published author she can do it on her own.", "NTA that's wild I don't understand how she would even be comfortable trying to pass the book off as hers..
