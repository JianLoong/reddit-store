To my complete surprise, he said that we would be hosting because some of his cousins asked him to since they wanted an excuse to visit our city. I expressed my surprise that his family would all agree to have a vegan Christmas dinner and he replied that they didn\u2019t. At this point I was confused because there was no way that I was going to cook seafood and I told him as much. He said that he had already agreed for us to host and that everyone had already started making travel plans and some flights/hotels have already been booked so we couldn\u2019t back out now. He assumed that I would be okay preparing seafood for his family because apparently he is fine handling seafood. I do almost all the cooking because he is terrible at it so him cooking Christmas dinner is not an option.\n\nNow all my in-laws are mad at me for \u201cruining Christmas\u201d by cancelling the plans they had made and are threatening to disinvite us from the Christmas celebration.

Tell him to remember who keeps the bed warm.", "NTA worst part is your SO readily agree without you consent and cause other to make plan. \n\nBut maybe you can compromise with catering or something since you are fine with hosting vegan meal ? \nConsidered this a one time blundered from your SO and bite the bullet just for the peace.", "NTA! Your husband totally made all the plans,without consulting you. First off,he didn't even ok it with you to host anyone in your house. Then,knowing you are the one who will be cooking,tells you that you have to cook seafood for them when you are against that. No. You didn't ruin Christmas dinner. He did. He should have talked to you about the plans before he started just inviting people over and volunteering you to cook things you don't want to cook.", "You weren\u2019t told you were hosting Christmas? NTA.", "NTA. Because you husband should not be offering to host an event if he doesn\u2019t intend to cook/ cater it himself. It\u2019s not about the diet. It\u2019s about volunteering you without your permission.", "NTA.\nThat's a decision that you should've made together, but he went behind your back.\nHe has nothing to be upset, you, on the other hand, should be very upset since it seems you married an AH that thinks his extended family is more a priority than you, his nuclear family. \nGood luck.", "You didn\u2019t need to cancel, you just need to ensure your husband did all the cooking. I can see why his family are annoyed but it should be with him, not you.", "NTA. But don't cook what you don't want to. And if the inlaws complain, tell them they knew you were a vegan. Then you'll never have to host again.", "This is why they have resturants. Everybody comes to stay. They all go out and get whatever they want, seperate checks please, and then maybe they all have drinks and vegan desserts back at their place. Problem solved. \n\nMy SO ever did that I'd be like \"Uhuh, you cater it because you didn't ask and I'm not cooking it!\"", "NTA. You\u2019re husband better learn to cook or start calling restaurants ASAP. He was the AH for not only volunteering to host without talking to you, but then volunteering you to cook all the food without talking to you first. Whether it\u2019s vegan or not is irrelevant. The lack of communication on his part is atrocious and disrespectful and makes him a huge AH.", "NTA. Let your husband cook if it's that important to him", "NTA\n\nHe unilaterally decided to do this, he can unilaterally cook. And him cooking IS an option, since he chose to do this, he can learn very fast.", "Hear me out-  have you husband order and pay for the seafood dishes from a restaurant. It will keep your kitchen cleaner (although you will still be making vegan side dishes)      \n\nHe's the AH for unilaterally deciding to volunteer you to host a big family dinner.", "NTA. There were no accidents or mistakes here. This was all on purpose. He didn't talk to you about this because he knew you'd say no, so, instead, he decided to spring it on you, maybe a week from Christmas, because he thought you would feel too pressured to refuse. You have no responsibility to uphold promises you didn't make. He has no right to promise your labor without so much as an if-you-please. He does not have the authority to make unilateral decisions about hosting in your shared home. He ruined Christmas, he caused problems with his family, et cetera, et cetera.", "NTA\n\nIf your husband is the one who said that you both would host and he's able to handle seafood, then he can make the damn dinner regardless of how terrible he is at cooking.", "Your husband is a huge asshole for planning this without your permission. He can pay to have it catered. NTA", "Hosting Christmas is a big task/ cooking for a big group shouldn\u2019t be done against someone will or guilted into. I\u2019m not vegan but my family always wants me to cook cause it\u2019s my hobby. Guess who doesn\u2019t come around for holidays now. Don\u2019t let them push you around - tell them you will get the house ready but someone else better cook", "NTA\n\nhow hard would it have been for him to say \"hey how do you feel about hosting this year?\" beforehand? \n\ntbh we're in tge same situation, being vegan, hosting fish Christmas dinner with inlaws this year. we don't mind cooking the fish, but we discussed it all beforehand, like adults", "NTA. He can either cook the seafood, or his family will only have what you have chosen to prepare. You don\u2019t expect them to not have meat on your behalf when they are hosting, but unless they want to provide and prepare it (or again, your husband) they shouldn\u2019t expect you to make it if you\u2019re the host.", "Your husband TAH.  He didn\u2019t even discuss this with you before giving everyone the ok.", "NAH but maybe a compromise? Can you all go out for the feast? Find a restaurant that has decent options for all parties? Or ask his family members to cook the meat while you prepare the vegan dishes? Isn\u2019t there any room for middle ground?", "NTA, he agreed to host, you didnt. Let him prepare all the seafood and see how that goes. Your husband is the butthole.", "NTA. He is an adult. He can learn to cook if he wants to host like this", "Nta. I don't ever cook seafood. I would assume you need some experience to handle it properly.", "NTA. Tell them that your husband ruined it by not talking to you and that they are all selfish for expecting you to cook seafood for them.", "You have a husband problem more than an in laws problem. Granted the in laws should really be mad at their son since he was the one that agreed to host and provide seafood", "NTA, they are just trying to manipulate you into doing it so they can get their way. If they want their seafood then can come help prepare it. Tell them you wanna come visit great, you want vegan food I make great, but you want seafood then make your own. Your being upfront and not sneaky about, like another poster who agreed to host including making the \u201ctraditional meal\u201d but then decided every dish would be vegan without telling anyone. You on the other hand we\u2019re not even given a choice you were just voluntold (volunteer and told but together for those who have never heard that expression). Your husband and family need to learn to communicate and respect others. Christmas is about family not a stupid seafood dinner.", "ESH. Your husband should have talked to you about hosting. It was an AH move to agree to host, while knowing that cooking lays mainly on you. He\u2019s definitely more of an AH. However, your reaction is over the top. You can\u2019t ask anyone attending to bring a seafood dish?? You can\u2019t order any seafood dishes from a local restaurant?? A little bit of thought could waylay the issues here.", "NTA but you could hire a cook for a day or have dinner catered.", "This was posted yesterday with just a few details changed. What a suspiciously specific common issue. \n\nIf it\u2019s real, this is easy - your husband\u2019s family, your husband\u2019s issue. He can cook shitty seafood, they can bring it, or everyone can do without. As the AITA saying goes though, you have a husband problem.", ">I do almost all the cooking because he is terrible at it \n\nAh, the old weaponized incompetence gambit! Wreck a couple of meals and you never have to cook again. I'd make a giant fresh vegan salad and call it a day. If your husband wants something else, he can make/buy it.", "NTA- even if you were willing, you\u2019re not going to know how to cook fish well!!! If it is not disgusting to you, and you would be otherwise ok with hosting, you could theoretically allow someone else to cook the meal at your home. But you have no obligation to do this and every right to keep your home/kitchen meat free if you want to!", "NTA This vegetarian (vegan lite) would be repulsed by handling and cooking fish.", "NTA oh my cod! This should not be your sole problem to host at your plaice.  Haven't you haddock enough of the in laws? Why are they getting crabby?", "Ever.", ">But you should just do a 100% vegan meal without consulting your hubby.\n\nGoldfish crackers, nut roast in the shape of a fish, that sort of thing.", "Heck I\u2019m not even vegan, I like and cook seafood regularly, yet I know that means putting up with seafood smell in the house that is not peasant. I can fully appreciate a vegan not wanting it cooked in their home, by themselves or even by someone else.\n\nOP is NTA by a long shot. Husband should have absolutely asked before assuming this was ok and volunteering THEIR home.", "Every vegan I know does it for health reasons and aren\u2019t bothered by meat. She\u2019s going to have to figure something out because they can\u2019t just not host his family forever.", "So what\u2019s the compromise? She seems fine with hosting them if the meal is vegan, but that\u2019s been rejected. Her husband is a lousy cook, so he can\u2019t do it. I guess they could get it catered? But I\u2019d say the person that volunteered to host is the one that needs to come up with the compromise.", "\n>this strict vegan that you can\u2019t compromise for one holiday\n\nWould you compromise your serious moral beliefs for one holiday?", "I\u2019m not vegan or even vegetarian, and I wouldn\u2019t want people cooking a bunch of fish in my house. The smell is so gross.", ">Or let your husband cook the meat and \"sink or swim\" - not your problem.\n\nThe family and husband would absolutely, 100% guaranteed, still make OP out to be the problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I was vegetarian most of my life, but didn't make 100% vegetarian food for my guests because hosting is a huge part of making your guests comfortable.\n\n...which is probably why OP has consistently declined to host, isn't it.", "Eating a vegetarian diet and being a vegan arent very similar. Your anecdote doesnt really convert to OPs situation.   \n  \n Honestly it sounds like OP is a vegan(from what we know) and her husband is just someone who eats a plant-based diet.", "Nice", "The in laws just wanna be selfish with the shellfish", "This made me chuckle a little too much.", "I\u2019m sure the in-laws and entire family are equally exhausted by the entitlement the vegan has", "She doesn\u2019t. She just isn\u2019t cooking fish.", "Every vegan I know does it for ethical reasons.", "I will concede that for Xmas, certain foods are considered traditional and so people will miss them if they\u2019re not available.  But for other times when family might visit, why is it so intolerable, with so many delicious vegan options available, for the non-vegans to eat one meal without meat?", "Because he was not going to do it.  People who volunteer other peoples times and effort don't actually step up.", "Yes, her husband could do the cooking, even if he's a lousy cook.  He's apparently willing to handle seafood.  Let him serve some bad food, even if he loses face.  It might teach him to consult with his wife before volunteering to host a non-vegan dinner.  Since he's the biggest AH, this seems like the best option to me.\n\nAnd yes, catering is another option.  Or letting family members bring dishes to contribute.  \n\nPlenty of people here in the thread have thought of options.  So it's conspicuous that OP mentioned none of these.", "What entitlement are you referring to, exactly?", "She cancelled Christmas- that\u2019s hurting the entire family", "Perhaps Op could find a commune where only vegans exist. An adult vomiting on food prepared for guests clearly has issues with maturity not to mention self control issues lol. But to each their own.", "That\u2019s is such a grand sweeping statement lol", "Is he incapable of thinking up his own solutions?    \n\nWhy should she help with the mental load, when he blindsighted her and tried to dump *all* the mental load *and* work at her feet?", "Why should his wife help him when he never asked for her opinion and his only solution is to have her do everything? He\u2019s not being a good partner but a complete AH. OP is NTA", "> but I get a AH vibe from her as well.\n\nMostly because you're backtracking after being a little too eager to jump on the anti-vegan bandwagon 90% of this sub loves to drive around.", "They might have opened the page before you edited the comment and so unless they refreshed the page, they would not have seen your edit before they commented.", "I guess, it\u2019s just that agreeing to host before even talking to her is such a huge AH move that anything after that is so minor in comparison.", "OP said that her husband is a lousy cook, so it\u2019s doubtful he\u2019ll be doing the cooking.", "The kind where Christmas is canceled over fish with no attempt at compromise.", "Should\u2019ve asked her before then no ? Shouldn\u2019t force her to cook something she doesn\u2019t want to and is contrary to her values no ?

Get your face up close and really breathe in deep.   Really get that stench into your nostrils and down the back of your throat.

If OP\u2019s husband and family wanted her to compromise, they should have asked her before deciding that she would host and cook.", "So let me get this straight, she got Christmas prep dumped on her as well as the expectation that she prepare something she morally disagrees with and you\u2019re calling her the entitled one?
