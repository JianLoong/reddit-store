Covid also = disposable glove shortage so that option is out. No I am not OCD, nor a germophobe, it's a sensory thing.\nAlso I despise seafood and the smell of it cooking. I will never let it be cooked in my home.\n A vegan hating everything about meat including the handling of it is not weird or unreasonable at all.\n\nThe only \"bad\" vegans are the Vegangelicals who proselytize and tout their dietary choices as the only choice and go about actively shaming, mocking, judging, and alienating anyone who won't bend to their ways.", "NTA obviously but \n\nHe is terrible at cooking and he invites people over without telling you? \n\nHow is that your problem? \n\nCook everything you want to and let him cook the seafood and the meat. \n\nHis choice, his responsability. \n\nIf it's disgusting then, that is not your problem. \n\nYou are making his issues yours.

I\u2019m thinking of something like the Italian dinner with 7 kinds of fish. Even if you did cook meat, you might not have the recipes, equipment or skills to cook all that.
