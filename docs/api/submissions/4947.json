To my complete surprise, he said that we would be hosting because some of his cousins asked him to since they wanted an excuse to visit our city. I expressed my surprise that his family would all agree to have a vegan Christmas dinner and he replied that they didn\u2019t. At this point I was confused because there was no way that I was going to cook seafood and I told him as much. He said that he had already agreed for us to host and that everyone had already started making travel plans and some flights/hotels have already been booked so we couldn\u2019t back out now. He assumed that I would be okay preparing seafood for his family because apparently he is fine handling seafood. I do almost all the cooking because he is terrible at it so him cooking Christmas dinner is not an option.\n\nNow all my in-laws are mad at me for \u201cruining Christmas\u201d by cancelling the plans they had made and are threatening to disinvite us from the Christmas celebration.

That was an individual decision.\n\nSounds like you should go to couples therapy given that he resents your diet, makes decisions in the household without you, and then makes you the villain. He put a ring on your finger and said that you would be partners for life, why is he more allied with his bio family than you?", "Someone else should bring & prepare the meat dishes", "Just make vegan everything. I assume they knew you were vegan when they were hosting (?) I would never expect meat in a vegan person's house  NTA", "There is a third, albeit expensive option.   Have the seafood feast catered.    NTA for not checking with you before agreeing to host obviously.", "Also it sounds like this is that American seven fishes thing so its not like her husband is asking for one grilled fish dish but for some crazy fish shenanigans I wouldn't want to attempt myself as a fish enjoyer.\n\nNTA", ">It\u2018s a major red flag to give you such a huge task without your agreement.\n\nIt sounds to me like OPs husband didn't like saying \"no\" to hosting other years, so used this as an opportunity to try and strong-arm OP into doing it. He probably figured she'd just cave to keep the peace.\n\nI hope OP sticks to their guns and makes the hubby cook, or makes him be the bad guy that he is & admit his wrongdoing to the family.", "Oh no \u2014 he volunteered *HIS* labor. He just didn\u2019t realize it at the time.\n\nSo OP, what Christmas Day spa experience can we contribute towards for you?\n\nNTA", "I agree, though I would have given him a bit of grace if he was the one who organizes and cooks.", "Best response.  Let him deal with dinner while you relax \ud83d\ude00", "See, the problem with this is that the rest of the family provides vegan options yet all the vegans here seem to think that doing the same is an unreasonable burden.  \n\nI think YTA.", "I've been vegetarian most of my life, and am not particularly upset by meat, but I've never cooked meat or seafood before. I don't know how it's supposed to look when it's done, or what it's supposed to taste like. The only seafood I've ever eaten is canned tuna. Even if I were willing to attempt cooking a seafood dinner, unless it's frozen fishsticks I can't imagine it would be very good or safe to eat.", "I'm not vegan and I hate the smell of most seafoods/fish.", "Seafood cooking has a strong stench. It will be in her house lingering for days.", "You can screw up seafood horribly and with great odor if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, even if you enjoy eating it. It\u2019s not an easy cook, especially not as part of an elaborate meal that you didn\u2019t know was expected of you til a week or two out.", "There is zero middle ground possible when I find out that I have been volunteered to host a huge holiday days before said holiday.  He can figure it out himself, I would leave and go somewhere else for Christmas by myself.", "Getting seafood catered for Christmas Eve is something that should be handle way earlier. Might not be possible now.", "Way to find a solution!", "Seafood on Christmas Eve isn\u2019t an American tradition. I know Catholics from European countries who do this as well.", "I am a great cook, but Ive never been a fan of seafood.. I wouldn't know the first thing about preparing it. This is asking ALOT, even outside of OP being vegan. Many people are not accustomed to preparing fish at home.", "And he doesn't even mention it until she asks where they're going? Was he going to tell her? Hosting is a LOT of work that takes a LOT of preparation.", "I don\u2019t totally *want* to ignore the vegan aspect, because \u201cpreachy vegan\u201d is a big trope on this sub, and I feel like it\u2019s important to emphasize that everyone has a right to decide what they\u2019re willing to cook and serve in their own home. If this comes down to OP\u2019s husband deciding he\u2019ll cater the non-vegan portion and OP still isn\u2019t willing to violate her food boundaries in her home, that\u2019s still her right.", "Unfortunately, I don't believe goldfish crackers are vegan...", "It's different for a non-vegan to cook something for a vegan than it is for a vegan to cook for a non-vegan. A non-vegan is used to cooking meat and/or fish. Plus, for some vegans, it makes them queasy to do so.", "OOH I like this idea.  Let OP open several tins of tuna to place in front of each plate.  And a couple of fishsticks too....Maybe a tin of anchovies or two?  They have small tins of crabmeat you can buy and cans of shrimp.  \n\nShe could open a few of them.  Put out a jar of mayo(for tuna), a jar of horseradish/tartar sauce for the fishsticks and some cream cheese? for a cheap wonton style filling/dip with the crabmeat.  \n\nIn other words, a little Malicious compliance<grin>", "The smell of cooking fish disgusts me.", "She IS willing to host. They are not willing to be hosted by someone who isn't going to cater to their very specific food tradition. There is no other situation in which anyone would think that's okay to blame her except vegan/vegetarian. If she didn't know how to cook, if her kitchen wasn't big enough, if she was allergic, if she was Jewish (I'm assuming shellfish is involved), would anyone say \"get over it and act like a restaurant for them?\" \n\n\nSeriously - literally any food. Wibta if I demanded that my inlaws made me a lasagna for Christmas dinner if they wanted my presence? Yes. It is okay to expect you to feed your guests a food that they can comfortably eat, but no rules of etiquette say that they are allowed to demand a specific food.", ">but he doesn't know how.... he's a terrible cook....so OP always has to cook.  \n>  \n>He's just can't learn, his manpaws can't cut veggies, or devein shrimp.", "OP should serve a completely vegan dinner just for the halibut.", "Umm don\u2019t you mean - shell-fish?", "The seven fishes thing? I thought it was American, like the 'italian' Americans. I was under the impression here in Europe it was like a main grilled dish in some families.\n\nEdit: I checked, the seven fishes thing is American. The eating fish instead of meat is related to Catholic fasting.", "It\u2019s also quite expensive to host. And then there\u2019s the cleaning, and where is everyone staying?", "Then don't host or order out.", "The issue is the husband volunteered her to host his whole family without telling her! The seafood just adds insult to injury.", "Because her husband assumed she would cook?", "Op didn\u2019t want to host, the whole post is about op not being consulted in this matter. I\u2019m sure if there was a conversation about the topic then they could\u2019ve compromised but op\u2019s husband didn\u2019t even give op the chance. I\u2019m not vegan but I\u2019m pescatarian, I don\u2019t mind cooking meat but I need to know before hand since I use different cookware.", "This is a compromise if you don\u2019t want to cook.

It's not her fault.", "She didn't cancel, they did, because she's not going to be a restaurant.

His plan A, B, and C was wife cooking.

DH decided it without including her. OP is most definitely NTA here.", "I always like to go to other animals in these situations. How would you feel if I demanded you roast me a kitten for my dinner? Well, that's how she feels about her inlaws dinner request. \n\n\nIts like the religion joke- there are 1,000 religions that Christians don't believe in.... well, atheists don't believe in 1,000. There are thousands of species of animals that (general) you won't eat. Well, I don't eat thousands of species plus ten. \n\n(It's more dramatic for byproducts.... You don't consume the byproduct of any animal except for two or three, I don't consume the byproduct of any animal.)", "No.. By her own admission she was aware his family takes turns hosting. The real issue here is non vegan food in her home. If my wife reacted this way, she would not be my wife. The compromise here is to order food you won\u2019t cook or find another solution to procure said dishes, not die on a bill over fuckin food. They obviously get accommodated when they go to a relatives. SMH", "She was aware his family takes turns hosting and has all kinds of traditions.
