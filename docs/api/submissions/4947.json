Tell them you wanted to cancel hosting because you can't cook seafood and you know he isn't a great cook.

Stick to your guns and don't help.\n\n2nd: if you have to do the cooking make it clear it will be a Vegan Christmas dinner despite tradition due to your beliefs.\n\nI would make a point in tell his family your self, don't count on him telling them...put him right back on the spot like he did to you, let them make their choice so the AH blame shifts off of you and towards him.", "He can learn how to cook. \nNTA", "This was my thought. You could take the vegan element out of the equation entirely and husband would still be the AH of this situation.
