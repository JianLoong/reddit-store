You and your husband are the ones that need to be happy with the photos, everyone else can just hush up.

You kept your cool during your wedding, and solved the issue with the photos tastefully.", "NTA - What should I **not** wear to a wedding as a guest?\n\n**First and foremost: don't wear a white dress** (unless the couple requests all-white attire as a stylistic choice). Further, avoid matching the colors worn by the bridal party, wearing anything that is too revealing, sexy, or flashy, or opting for clothes that are overly casual, like jeans and sneakers, even at a casual-attire wedding. This is basic standard wedding etiquette. Your brother and SIL probably just didn't know. People today are taught that pretty much anything goes, with everything.

I have so many ideas...", "NTA - it's a known thing that you don't wear white to a wedding unless the bride or groom says so.\n\nI have no clue why they are hurt by this.

I can totally see that maybe other people live under the same rock as me, and give them the benefit of the doubt that they didn't know. However, weddings run EASILY into the tens of thousands of dollars. If any picture of me from someone's wedding is ruining the vibe for any reason, the bride and groom are perfectly within their rights to have their expensive photographer fix the problem. I don't care if I'm caught picking my nose, or maybe I spilled wine on myself, or my hair was funky, or maybe I just plain photobombed a shot. Fix the issue.

White cloth was by far the most expensive to buy, and lace (also very expensive) and embroidery cost an enormous amount of time and skill to add to the dress thus raising the value even further. At some point, as with many things, religion got dragged into it and the whole 'purity' thing began. In fact, for most marriage ceremonies the bridal party all wore the same thing, just as the grooms party still does today; the idea being that evil spirits would be unable to target the bride and groom because they were hidden from them. The outrage felt today is less to do with the dress itself, and more to do with the blatant disrespect shown to the bride by someone trying to 'outdo' her.", "Exactly this.

Debutantes had long been required to wear white court dresses and long white gloves for their first presentation at court, at a \"Drawing Room\" where they were introduced to the queen for the first time.\n\nRoyal brides before Victoria did not typically wear white, instead choosing \"heavy brocaded gowns embroidered with white and silver thread,\" with red being a particularly popular colour in Western Europe more generally.[4] During this time, European and American brides wore a plethora of colours, including blue, yellow, and practical colours like black, brown, or gray. As accounts of Victoria's wedding spread across the Atlantic and throughout Europe, fashionable people followed her lead.\n\nBecause of the limitations of laundering techniques before the later part of the 20th century, white dresses provided an opportunity for conspicuous consumption. They were favored primarily as a way to show the world that the bride's family was so wealthy and so firmly part of the leisure class that the bride would choose an elaborate dress that could be ruined by any sort of work or spill\"\n\nFrom wikipedia. \n\nAlthough it later started symbolizing innocence, it also states that veils were meant to symbolize that \"bride was too shy to be seen by anyone before her wedding\". And yet nobody protested that they saw her yesterday without a veil and that she's a hypocrite", "Um no it doesn't.\n\n\"However, the white dress didn\u2019t initially catch on because it symbolized an unsullied heart. It caught on because it looked like money. At the time, most women exchanged vows in dresses they already owned, and there was only one group of people who could afford to own anything white: the leisure class. There weren\u2019t dry cleaners and laundromats around in the late 19th-century, so it took money to maintain a white outfit.\n\nBuying a white dress was seen as extremely impractical, especially when one considered the festivities of a wedding. Between the drinking, the dancing, and the scooping of desserts, chances were the frock would be ruined and only be worn once. No working-class woman would be able to afford that kind of frivolousness.\"\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/style/article/history-white-wedding-dress-royal-wedding/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/history-white-wedding-dress-royal-wedding/index.html)\n\n\"After Queen Victoria\u2019s wedding, wealthier brides started wearing grand white gowns, because they could afford to have their white attire professionally cleaned (brides would still wear their wedding dress long after the big day!). Some books at the time noted that white wedding dresses were ideal because they represented purity and innocence, but according to white wedding dress history, that wasn\u2019t the case. White was seen as a color for the rich, more about showing off one\u2019s wealth than one\u2019s virginity.\"\n\nhttps://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/white-wedding-dress-history", "Actually, pale blue is considered virginal and the reason why you always see Virgin Mary dressed in pale blue.

It's entirely possible the niece didn't realize wearing white to a wedding is an absolute no-no, and the fact SIL didn't ask her to change says *everything*.\n\nThe fact SIL is throwing a hissy fit for changing the color of the dress, and trying to manipulate the situation by claiming she's bodyshaming her (WTF? This makes zero sense!) makes me think SIL is jealous of OP or the wedding and she orchestrated this whole thing to ruin the wedding without having to deal with being judged if she had been the one to show up in a white dress (but I bet she wanted to!)\n\nOP, make sure to be proactive about explaining why you changed the photos.

If a six year old is unexpectedly wearing a white dress to a wedding, the person that got them ready knew what they were doing and is pulling an AH move.\n\nThe 16 year old is likely NTA, because a lot of these etiquette norms don't come up until an appropriate situation arises. The bride is NTA to have found a very amenable way to still be the only one in the fancy white dress at her own wedding. \n\nNot enough info to be certain, but SIL was in the position to know the etiquette, help her daughter plan the outfit, then redirects the color edit from social norms to body shaming. There's a 99% chance SIL is TA here, and OP's niece as a meatshield to hide behind.", ">\"It was inappropriate to wear a white lacy dress to out wedding, so we just changed the colour of the dress. What was YOUR motives in choosing that dress?\"\n\nI love this response, but if I were OP I wouldn't engage in a conversation with SIL at all. Nothing will be accomplished by it. SIL knew it was an A.H. move to let her daughter wear white to the wedding at all.  SIL is deflecting and trying to make the situation about something that it is not.

When I realized wearing white to a wedding is a no no, I wanted to melt into the floor.", "What IS the point to this behavior? Seriously? How did these performers get so screwed up in their souls that they go out of their way to do this stuff?", "But how do they become the center of attention by doing this? Do people flock around them to tell them they're misbehaving? To get pictures taken with them or get their autograph? To be told by the grandmothers that they're outrageous? I just don't see the payoff.", "My family is superstitious, black means you're mourning the marriage. It was on the invitations, one person showed up wearing black and she got asked to leave lmao", "Like that white and gold dress that was circling the internet a few years ago! Some saw white and gold, others saw idk, some other colour. OP could have said oh it must've been the lighting! Haha \n\nFor real though,  unless the bride says it's ok to wear white, don't do it. I don't think the niece really is to blame here, even if she chose the dress, her mum should have told her it wasn't OK to wear that and told her to choose something else or a different colour", "\ud83d\udcaf", "That would be really awesome if she could pull that off! But I just wouldn't be able to sustain that level of dishonesty haha", "Honestly, I got married less than a year ago and it was a small (less than 100 people? Maybe even just 50 people?) and I wouldn\u2019t have even *noticed* a simple white dress. If it had been more wedding dress-like I would\u2019ve been upset at first but everything was such a whirlwind of emotion and activity (and shots with my bridesmaids) that at a certain point I wouldn\u2019t have even cared. Dancing with my husband, dancing with my father, chatting with my girls, having everyone want to greet me and take pictures? I just wouldn\u2019t have noticed anything", "The wedding attire subreddit is absolutely bonkers. \u201cNo white\u201d has extended to even hints of white in designs, light colors in general, or anything that might possibly look white if photographed in black and white", "Were you invited to a wedding before you found it out?

They look completely ridiculous, especially next to the beautiful bride!\" Especially the mother in law ones, they think people are whispering about how great they look. Better to let them know everyone thought they looked like an attention seeking fool!", "No, that makes SIL think she got all the attention after all. Just stick with the photographer.", "Haha fair enough.  Everyone is different after all - that just isn\u2019t at all like the 15-18 year olds I know today.

And what 16-year-old wouldn't have shown the dress to her mom, especially because she wasn't being outrageous in a standard way?  Mom was not helpless here even if the kid bought her own dress.", "I'm old school.

Hard to believe or understand.", "Even if she didn't, this is fully on Mom. That said, my guess is SIL bought the dress and told her daughter that it is what OP wanted her to wear to the wedding. No self respecting 16 year old would wear a knee length white lace dress with gloves... at least none that I know. Especially the gloves - to a teen girl that is like wearing panty hose - she ONLY would have done it if she felt like she had to.", "Yes, exactly. Someone close to me wore a white dress to my wedding, but it didn\u2019t look like a wedding dress, and I didn\u2019t even really notice or think about it until later. It was a little odd, but she wasn\u2019t the type to try to upstage anyone. I think she just had mom brain and didn\u2019t think about it.", "I totally agree. A 15-year-old in a white sundress isn\u2019t going to outshine a bride in a white wedding gown!", "I genuinely had never heard this until I started reading reddit maybe 6 or 7 years ago, and I'd been to about two dozen weddings before that (all in the UK). That said, I never wore a white dress regardless, because the colour washes me out.", "Long-standing? I'm close to 80 and I've been to dozen of American weddings and only heard about this \"tradition\" maybe five years ago. Of course, my household  culture is not filled with bridezillas.", "No. This weird obsession is completely American. No one would ever bat an eye about a guest in white at a wedding in Europe. Especially a child. Back in my youth, a lot of kids only had their white confirmation dress as formal dresses and also used them for other formal events like a wedding. People are not blind enough to not realize who the bride is.", "I probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed or cared at all. In fact, I probably would\u2019ve liked someone else being the center of attention lol. My favorite part of my wedding was leaving it with my new husband.", "Lol. Wouldn\u2019t the fact that you\u2019re even commenting on this post make you a reddit folk? \n\n\nEither way, wearing white to a wedding is a major faux pas and goes far beyond reddit. It screams attention-seeking and tacky. With all the colors in the universe, why else would someone *need* to wear the same color as the bride (the person meant to stand out)?", "Maybe so... But the wedding day is the bride's day so it doesn't really matter what others may feel about it, as the bride's wishes and protecting the integrity of her as the central focus of the day should be paramount.", "This sounds exactly like my wedding minus the mil in white. Love it", "Yeah that sort of thing is a test alright, but not in the direction the tester thought it was.", "I think white is a no-no in eastern cultures as well, because it's their mourning color as opposed to black in the west.  An Indian friend of mine once told me she still gets the creeps seeing brides in white at western weddings, just because it's so ingrained in her.  So verboten no matter which cultures as far as I know.", "I once turned up to a wedding only to realize I was wearing the same colour as the bridesmaids. I was mortified because I didn't want anyone, but especially the couple, to think it was because I was butthurt about not being chosen for the bridal party.", "not everyone is from the usa", "NTA OP.  No, there was NO reason to reach out to your niece about the color change of the dress.  You didn't alter her physical appearance, just the color of a dress that shouldn't have been worn at all.  This was your wedding and not your niece and I agree with most, if 16 year old didn't know the \"White dress wedding etiquette\", surely her Mom (your SIL) did.  I knew this at the age of 12 (now 60) but then manners and respect were practiced more then than now.", "There\u2019s a lot of intensity to weddings in general I think, probably in every culture.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a breach of etiquette to wear white to a wedding. I didn\u2019t care what anyone wore to my wedding.

I walked in to her vomiting in the 2 inch bridal suite sink.  I pointed out that the toilet was a foot to her right and asked if she could make it.  Her husband just looked at me and shook his head.  Again - before the ceremony.\n\nShe took off her shoes during the speeches and put her smelly bare feet on the table. (says my sober mother)\n\nShe passed out and rose from the dead like 5 times.  We found out that she was pregnant.  Kid came out fine.\n\nThe rest of us were only slightly better.", "I think children (not teens) are the exception. The bride won\u2019t be upstaged by them and no one\u2019s going to think a child is the bride :) I\u2019m sure you were adorable and it was just fine!\n\nI was a young adult when I did mine. I genuinely had zero idea that white was forbidden unless you were the bride. Obviously one shouldn\u2019t try to wear a bridal gown or upstage the bride but it wasn\u2019t until I had a Reddit account that I found out wearing any white was considered rude. \n\nI must live with my failure and that\u2019s that lol.", "I\u2019m not gonna say it would be a better world if this were the case, but it would certainly be funnier.

I texted the dress I was wearing to my friend's wedding to clear it with her, and she was like, \"You've got bright red and black braids. I'm sure the dress isn't what people would really care about.\".\n\nShe was right, but I realized afterward that the dress I had worn had male and female skeletons dancing around a gravestone, along with a crow.

My point is that you not caring about etiquette and basic social politeness and manners doesn't mean they don't exist.\n\nSometimes, it's referred to as culture. For instance, I  can eat as I'm walking down a public sidewalk here if i want to and whether or not an individual sees that as acceptable. In our culture, I can do it. This doesn't make it polite.\n\nIf I go to Japan, it's a HUGE social faux pas to eat while I'm walking. It's just rude and not socially or societally acceptable.
