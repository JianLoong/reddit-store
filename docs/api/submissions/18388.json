You and your husband are the ones that need to be happy with the photos, everyone else can just hush up.

I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong and you rose above the situation diplomatically. Maybe you could have said something to give the mum a heads up but since you only changed the colour, not the style then it\u2019s not that big a deal in my opinion. The mum should have steered the daughter away from that outfit choice - it\u2019s really bad form to wear a white dressy dress to a wedding if you are not the bride.

You already finished the event without making a deal of the dress...a slight color change by the photographers shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.", "NTA, they knew what they were doing, props to you for not making a scene and just sorting it quietly.", "NTA\n\nBut this is why you should've communicated to them why this isn't acceptable.

I would let her know that you didn't want to ruin the day by making a scene but it was not okay for your niece to wear white as as her mother SIL should have told her to wear something different.  That doesn't mean you have to see that BS every time you looked at YOUR wedding photos.  If SIL doesn't like it she can pay money to Photoshop it back for her own records.", "NTA and tell you SIL that you were doing your niece a kindness because you didn't want to have people see her GIGANTIC faux pas of wearing white to a wedding and think she was raised in a barn.", "NTA.

You kept your cool during your wedding, and solved the issue with the photos tastefully.", "NTA - What should I **not** wear to a wedding as a guest?\n\n**First and foremost: don't wear a white dress** (unless the couple requests all-white attire as a stylistic choice). Further, avoid matching the colors worn by the bridal party, wearing anything that is too revealing, sexy, or flashy, or opting for clothes that are overly casual, like jeans and sneakers, even at a casual-attire wedding. This is basic standard wedding etiquette. Your brother and SIL probably just didn't know. People today are taught that pretty much anything goes, with everything. But etiquette rules exist to prevent hurt feelings such as yours.

I have so many ideas...", "NTA - it's a known thing that you don't wear white to a wedding unless the bride or groom says so.\n\nI have no clue why they are hurt by this. All that was changed was the color.", "NTA. It\u2019s tacky as hell to wear white to a wedding if your not the bride. Both your niece and your sil knew that and didn\u2019t care so this is on them.

I can totally see that maybe other people live under the same rock as me, and give them the benefit of the doubt that they didn't know. However, weddings run EASILY into the tens of thousands of dollars. If any picture of me from someone's wedding is ruining the vibe for any reason, the bride and groom are perfectly within their rights to have their expensive photographer fix the problem. I don't care if I'm caught picking my nose, or maybe I spilled wine on myself, or my hair was funky, or maybe I just plain photobombed a shot. Fix the issue.

Like change reality to suit her own narrative?", "NTA I'm guessing SIL did it on purpose but had your niece wear it so she could play the \"she is young and doesn't know better\" card", "NTA your niece is old enough to know the rules and honestly if you had removed her completely you still would've been in the right.", "NTA I'd bill her the fee for allowing it to begin with. Who doesn't know better in 2023? Who?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's common sense to not wear white to a wedding as a guest. She is 16, she should understand that, and if not - her mother -- or ANYONE around her should have told her.\n\nYour SIL's behaviour is so out of line, as well. Raging at you for slightly changing the colour of the dress in Photoshop -- when she was the one who let her daughter show up to someone's wedding dressed in white!!\n\nI could understand some anger if she was photoshopped out all together, but that obviously isn't the case\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. I would give the SIL two options. Daughter gets completely edited out of photos (at her cost) or the newly blue stays.

That's one of those traditions that still isn't stepped on.  The only person wearing white at the wedding should be the bride.  Yes, even if the bride opts to not wear white herself. She could be in fascia, and nobody should think about wearing a lacy white dress.\n\nYour SIL is an asshole.  She should have known better, and taught her daughter better manners.", "Nta. You didn't body shame, you dress shamed her. In your defense she wore white.", "It might have been good manners to ask her before making the substitution, but the accusation of \"body shaming\" is absurd. I also wouldn't begrudge a 16 year old girl for wearing what she wears to a big event, but her parents really lost veto rights over how the photographs are used or edited when they allowed their teenage daughter to wear white to a wedding.

High five \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f NTA", "NTA your SIL was clearly up to something though", "NTA.", "NTA lol the entitlement.

If she didn't want that to happen then she should have worn a WEDDING APPROPRIATE colour. \nYour SIL knew what she and her daughter were doing and knew it was wrong. They are A H's to the max. \n\nI hope you feel better about the changed photos.", "NTA. \n\n\nMost people know not to wear white to a wedding unless you're getting married in said wedding. If the SIL didn't want your niece photoshopped, then she should have had her daughter wear a more appropriate dress. \n\n\nI see nothing wrong with it. The photos are for you, and they make you happier. You didn't change her body, only the dress color, so it shouldn't be an issue.", "I love that you did that! NTA lol", "NTA.  But your SIL and niece are.  And now you know who your enemies are in the family.  Treat them accordingly.", "Nta her kid broke the biggest rule at a wedding she should be photoshopped out of it", "NTA- your photos, your decision, SIL has no sayin this.  She was in wrong in the first place for letting her daughter wear that dress.", "NTA. Body shaming is a stretch.", "NTA.  But, I would have let them know before they saw it on social media..", "NTA. You're way nicer than I would have been as I would have sent her home to change or not allowed her in my photos. It's rude to wear white to a wedding and her parents should have told her that.", "Of course you are NOT an asshole. Your brother and SIL are horrible people.", "NTA. Do you usually get along with SIL? Because I assume you're from a culture where wearing white to someone else's wedding is a faux pas, so your SIL would have known this dress was a bad choice (can't blame the teenager for not knowing). From her reaction, it sounds like SIL did this on purpose.", "NTA and your SIL is lucky you guys didn\u2019t kick them out of your wedding", "Nta but maybe should have given them a heads up before posting", "ESH\n\nSister for this bizarre notion that you were somehow calling niece ugly. \n\nNiece for wearing white when she should know better. \n\nYou for caring so much that she wore white.

Are you that insecure?", "As a guy who doesn't understand the outrage of wearing white dress to someone else's wedding, I say YTA. But clearly it's a bigger deal than I think, so I wouldn't put too much thought into my response haha I just don't see the issue. Someone else chose a colour of dress and you're offended because you're supposed to be the only person wearing that colour? Just sounds absurd to get worked up over.", "YTDoofus. This is so excessive and bratty lol.", "ESH: your nieces parents for not providing guidance that this is a social faux pas at weddings are the real assholes here. If the niece was just totally obsessed with this dress they should have given you a heads up, so the problem solving could have happened ahead of time. I\u2019m sure others were also commenting behind the nieces back and probably not politely so it wasn\u2019t responsible for the parents to allow her to wear that dress in the first place. \n\nYou are mildly an asshole for not just speaking up and letting them know what you planned to do for the photos. It was weird to spring it on everyone and hope no one noticed. I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole for caring about this, but I do think you\u2019re going to have to learn how to let shit go that doesn\u2019t matter in the long run. She\u2019s a child who wore a white dress to your wedding and the social convention for that is somewhat borderline anyhow. It\u2019s really not a big deal and spending money to fake the color of her dress seems over the top. People out a lot more energy into their weddings than they do into their marriages honestly.

Your guests are not dress up dolls that you photoshop to make yourself feel better. The white rule is stupid to begin with but even stupider to care about what a literal child is wearing.", "NTA.\n\nAnd this is could be more deliberately nasty than the women who personally wear white to ruin the bride\u2019s day.

Throw red wine on her niece?\n\nOP, have you had other problems with SIL?", "EXACTLY", "Good spidey sense", "SIL is ticked... she's probably the one who helped pick the dress and gloves and encouraged this.

This was the calmest, smartest response to this situation that I have ever seen. Its funny that SIL is mad. So what!

We just had the white dress changed to blue. Why are you projecting?", "I just had a brief \"omg\" moment while reading your comment for some reason. I just now, after reading all too many of these type stories, remembered a wedding I attended years ago. I borrowed a pair of black pants and a nice dress short from my stepmom. But then when I got there, I was given a white dress with black and pink details? I think it was like a cherry blossom type of motif? But primus I hope my friend's mom didnmt feel this way. She was the one who got me the dress (she was like a second mom to me in a way) so I doubt she would have got that one if she was worried about it, but at the same time... anxiety.", "I mean, at 16 this might be the first wedding she's been to and didnt know better.

While it's still tradition (not in all cultures I know) for the bride to wear white, the \"purity\" aspect has gone by the wayside.\n\nBrides are infinitely more likely to choose white today because that's what their mother wore; they imagined it that way as a child or simply because its pop culture. Than they are to even think about old fashioned \"purity.\"\n\nOh and for the record,  OP does not suck because she wore white, regardless of her experience, shall we say. You silly sausage.", "Actually no! Before Queen Victoria, women didn't actually wear white wedding dresses.

Your puritanical beliefs suck", "The white dress custom has absolutely nothing to do with purity originally. It was a 'boast' by the brides family, a way of showing wealth. White cloth was by far the most expensive to buy, and lace (also very expensive) and embroidery cost an enormous amount of time and skill to add to the dress thus raising the value even further. At some point, as with many things, religion got dragged into it and the whole 'purity' thing began. In fact, for most marriage ceremonies the bridal party all wore the same thing, just as the grooms party still does today; the idea being that evil spirits would be unable to target the bride and groom because they were hidden from them. The outrage felt today is less to do with the dress itself, and more to do with the blatant disrespect shown to the bride by someone trying to 'outdo' her.", "Exactly this.

I\u2019m not sure why you are fixating on the sexual status of the bride.", "I went back and checked your comment, and you said she sucks unless she's a virgin. You didn't actually say that she should have spoken to them at all. You joined the ideas of sucking and virginity (implied by the dress) by putting them in the same sentence. If we're getting picky about reading comprehension.", "\"Though Mary, Queen of Scots, wore a white wedding gown in 1559 when she married her first husband, Francis Dauphin of France, the tradition of a white wedding dress is commonly credited to Queen Victoria's choice to wear a white court dress at her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840. Debutantes had long been required to wear white court dresses and long white gloves for their first presentation at court, at a \"Drawing Room\" where they were introduced to the queen for the first time.\n\nRoyal brides before Victoria did not typically wear white, instead choosing \"heavy brocaded gowns embroidered with white and silver thread,\" with red being a particularly popular colour in Western Europe more generally.[4] During this time, European and American brides wore a plethora of colours, including blue, yellow, and practical colours like black, brown, or gray. As accounts of Victoria's wedding spread across the Atlantic and throughout Europe, fashionable people followed her lead.\n\nBecause of the limitations of laundering techniques before the later part of the 20th century, white dresses provided an opportunity for conspicuous consumption. They were favored primarily as a way to show the world that the bride's family was so wealthy and so firmly part of the leisure class that the bride would choose an elaborate dress that could be ruined by any sort of work or spill\"\n\nFrom wikipedia. \n\nAlthough it later started symbolizing innocence, it also states that veils were meant to symbolize that \"bride was too shy to be seen by anyone before her wedding\". And yet nobody protested that they saw her yesterday without a veil and that she's a hypocrite", "Um no it doesn't.\n\n\"However, the white dress didn\u2019t initially catch on because it symbolized an unsullied heart. It caught on because it looked like money. At the time, most women exchanged vows in dresses they already owned, and there was only one group of people who could afford to own anything white: the leisure class. There weren\u2019t dry cleaners and laundromats around in the late 19th-century, so it took money to maintain a white outfit.\n\nBuying a white dress was seen as extremely impractical, especially when one considered the festivities of a wedding. Between the drinking, the dancing, and the scooping of desserts, chances were the frock would be ruined and only be worn once. No working-class woman would be able to afford that kind of frivolousness.\"\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/style/article/history-white-wedding-dress-royal-wedding/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/history-white-wedding-dress-royal-wedding/index.html)\n\n\"After Queen Victoria\u2019s wedding, wealthier brides started wearing grand white gowns, because they could afford to have their white attire professionally cleaned (brides would still wear their wedding dress long after the big day!). Some books at the time noted that white wedding dresses were ideal because they represented purity and innocence, but according to white wedding dress history, that wasn\u2019t the case. White was seen as a color for the rich, more about showing off one\u2019s wealth than one\u2019s virginity.\"\n\nhttps://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/white-wedding-dress-history", "Actually, pale blue is considered virginal and the reason why you always see Virgin Mary dressed in pale blue. White weddings have never had anything to do with virginity.", "I could almost guarantee no other guests there cared, but now that the bride edited the pictures, everyone will focus on the niece and not the bride. She should have just left it alone.", "Because she is 16 years old and some things are more important than a color of a dress.\n\nAnyway I didn't say much about the dresa wearing itself. I said OP was TA because she did it without letting them know and posted on social media before speaking to them.", "People who were not at the wedding sure they won't be able to tell, but people who were there will focus on that not to mention I guarantee the teen and her Mother will make sure people know the bride changed the picture, which again will take the focus from her and back to the niece", "I would watch this episode of reality tv.", "\u201cHey sis, I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal at my wedding as niece looked gorgeous, but for the actual photos I made her her dress light blue, as I want to be the only one in white.\u201d\n\nThen discuss. If people have an issue, then maybe reconsider if the only one in white is the hill to die on, or maybe realize the wishes should have been made known before the wedding if it was that important.", "I mean, I doubt anyone else would really notice the edit. I cant remember what most of my family had worn to various weddings we've been to. Given that OP says it was well done, I doubt anyone will think twice about it", "I mean\u2026yeah, some things are more important than the color. So who cares if it\u2019s blue? It\u2019s not about if she wanted pictures of herself in it.", "So. Niece is in the wrong so I don't really care if gets a second of attention for the edit. It's not about attention it's about how the bride feels looking at her pictures and as long as she's happy then who cares? \n\nHer mother and the niece  can winge as much as they want imo it's still worse to wear a white dress than it is to have that dress edited blue.", "I guess I don\u2019t understand why her sister gives a fuck.", "I don\u2019t understand why the bride gives a fuck.
