My siblings both got the family names as their middle names and I was the special child who didn't. \n\nI would ask why you are so against it? If you plan on having a future with this person (even if it's five years down the road) is the middle name a hill you are willing to die on? And can you compromise and give the kid two middle names? There aren't a limit. And giving the kid that name and another will give them options when they are older for what they want. \n\nIf you are looking at exit strategies, then this is all kind of moot. If you plan on raising the child alone mostly or with your own family then not giving the child a family middle name is a good way of keeping them separate from the father's family.", "YWNBTA - But re-frame your thinking here. You're putting too much thought into the conflict. Does your boyfriend want the middle name? Then give the kid the middle name. If it's important to him, then let him have it. Don't let this become a \"me vs. the FIL\" thing because your BF will get caught in the middle of that animosity. \n\nSo re-frame it. Is it important to HIM? Then go with it. That's what I got from the first part of your post, it was important to him and now he's trying to extricate himself from the middle between you and his dad. Get out of that conversation rut, FIL has no input, what does the BF want in regards to the name? Please don't shut it down like this because of the FIL, completely remove any influence of the FIL from the picture. That's my advice.", "NTA.
