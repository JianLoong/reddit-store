I was out on vacation with Dan at the time and only heard about her condition after she went into surgery. She\u2019s healed up now but some things are permanently demanded.\n\nI told Dan that when we hang out I need to bring Amy. She doesn\u2019t bother us at all. If we\u2019re out at a restaurant, she\u2019ll get her own table. If we\u2019re doing things she stays in her own lane. If we\u2019re at my house she stays in the corner absorbed in her book. It\u2019s my boundary. \n\nDan is pissed because he wanted to hang out one one with me and I said yes we can talk together but my wife has to be in my eyesight. I brought her to the park and she went off to do her own thing while still being in my eyesight. \n\nHe called me crazy. He thinks it\u2019s weird and disrespectful of him. I think since I told him my plan it was fine and it was on him to understand my boundary. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My partner was suicidal in December last year (shortly after me being in psychiatric ward for being suicidal - I know complete mess). They couldn't get therapy immediately 'cause where I live it isn't really straightforward to get it sometimes.\n\nThe 24/7 strategy does not work! Either your partner *wants* to live or they won't. This is not in your control. You are draining yourself and only masking the things that are already there. Get her and yourself help. You are not doing what she needs right now. Psychological problems can't be solved by a loving partner. I wish only loving your partner hard enough would make depression and other issues go away. It doesn't. I have been through this from both ends. Therapy did wonders for me and my partner. We are both in so much better places and it was so helpful to have each other during therapy. A safe space to cry and just be miserable after you learned things about yourself. Your partner needs you as a support not as a guardian. \n\nIn the other comments I read that it is not possible to get therapy in your area, is this because it is not available or you assume she won't get help? If it is just that you can try online counseling as well. \n\nYTA - this might sound really cruel but you need to hear it: what you are doing right now might cost her life in the long run. You are preventing her from getting help by believing you can solve all these issues for her by just loving her enough and monitoring her. Thereby you drag other people into this as well. Mental health does not work like this! Psychological issues are not treated by enough love and good will from other people. She needs to get to a point where she wants to live. She needs to work on it. She needs to get medication. Nothing of this can be achieved by you. It is on her and to do that she needs professional help. Get that for her or you risk her (and yourself) being in a very sad and miserable place for a long time. I am not saying this because I don't empathize with you. I really do. I know your and her situation sadly.

With lots of help, I am perfectly safe by myself. I have no desire to harm myself anymore. Op is not doing  his wife a favor by having her with him at all times. I understand that he wants to protect her, but she needs help that he is not  qualified to give her. They are both adults that should be able to be away from each other to do their own things.", "You both are in DENIAL! She needs better help than just \"your watchful eyes\".", "Well something is definitely wrong with you being a helicopter parent", "I\u2019d like to suggest, that you don\u2019t need to have anything wrong with you to go to therapy. It could just be a really good way to get another perspective for her to think about instead of the sad one in her head. \n\nI think you would benefit from someone to talk to as well. I mean, you came here for our perspectives. It sounds like whatever happened was pretty traumatic for you. It could really help to have an hour or two to sit with someone who has experience with other \u201cclumsy\u201d people and unpack the best ways to deal with this.", "Something absolutely is wrong with her and she needs actual help, not a babysitter. You need to be an adult and her partner and step up to get her actual real, professional help. You are making it worse by enabling it.", "That\u2019s a reason to be in therapy. And if she\u2019s a danger to herself she needs to be put under psychological care", "I'm gonna try to be direct and helpful... If for any reason you can't be there tomorrow... What's she gonna do? For a full year she didn't learn how to be alone (any silly person should know how to), she self inflict cabbage (even when she says it ok, is not), and both refuse therapy (when it's clear both need it).\n\nThis is a ticking bomb, and you can't be 24/7 with her, and vice versa... Please, seek help before it's late", "Listen, bud.\n\nI have a *permanently* disabled wife with mental health issues. What you're doing isn't helping her or protecting her. It's putting her in even more danger.\n\nIf these moods get so bad that she cannot be alone for a few hours, she needs to be in therapy. If they aren't, and you're just in an overprotective mode, she will never become independent again. \n\nI understand your desire to protect her. I understand that you think you are. \n\nYou're not.\n\nThis has nothing to do with whether you're an AH or not. It has everything to do with the fact that you two are playing a dangerous game that you cannot win.", "You are supposed to be her partner. Not her father. Not her guardian. Not her overlord. \n\nDragging her everywhere with her to sit quietly in a corner while you socialize is not helping her! In fact, it probably makes her feel incredibly isolated and alone.", "You\u2019re coming across as unhinged.", "From what?", "When does she get to visit them? Do you go with her when she sees her friends?", "Then stop being an enabler and actually get her help duh", "Ok, so now that therapy is available virtually why not give that a try?\n\nAlso, to be completely honest, if you're so concerned about your wife's mental health that you dont feel shes safe alone for one or two hours, why not **drive** to where she can be inpatient? Which is whats needed if thats actually the case.\n\nBottom line, while I have so much sympathy for you, the situation that youre in just isnt sustainable or healthy. At all. And if you \"slip up\" and sleep too deeply, or if she decides to just go for a walk without you, it sounds very much like youll blame yourself if something happens.\n\nAs someone who has had close loved ones experiencing depression and suicidal ideation - you aren't enough for this. Your wife **needs** professional help. And so do you, to handle this situation.\n\nPlease, please seek help. Even if all you have access to is something like betterhelp or crisis lines. This is absolutely a crisis.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I 1000% concur! I had plans in place and reached out to a friend. In my state, you can go in for 72 hours which is kinda what I needed to just decompress. Now, OP, please seek professional help. If you don't like your psychiatrist or therapist, find a new one. It has saved my life. I sometimes just want disappear or not exist so I find healthy ways to do that, like going to the movies randomly by myself, but this was what I came up with after years of therapy.\n\nNo therapist in their right mind would recommend this. You keep saying you want to protect her, but people have unalived themselves by putting people in danger.\n\nTherapy helps you create tool boxes to deal with emotions. I have stuff I watch when I know I need to cry, laugh, or just escape reality for a second. A therapist is a 3rd unbiased party who could help both of you through this. You are legit making things worse for both of you.\n\nYou say she stops taking care of herself, but a therapist can help you come up with ways to tackle those bad days.", "This is what OP needs to hear!", "Your friend Dan is right. This is weird. You and Amy both need therapy. Couples and individual.", "Because you aren't actually fixing, healing, or resolving anything. You've just slapped a co-dependent bandaid on it. Which is clearly beginning to impact your other relationships. YTA. This is weird and unhealthy. You both need to get help so you can learn how to live an functional and autonomous adults.", "If she\u2019s bad enough that you\u2019re worried she\u2019s going to harm herself when she\u2019s out of your sight, then I promise you, she\u2019s far from happy.", "I highly doubt she is happy being dragged about to places, then forced to sit alone reading a book at a different table while you eat with your friends. \n\nHell, when I take my dog to a restaurant, I make sure ahead of time the place has patio seating that allows dogs. I don't leave her tied to a tree outside and watch her through the window!", "If you love her, you should want a better quality of life for her. If she can't be let out of your sight because she will hurt herself, that is a huge, detrimental obstacle she needs to work through. This is not sustainable.", "This is starting to sound like you want to keep her under your control instead of getting her the care she needs. It does not sound like she needs in care treatment. She needs a therapist and a psychiatrist.", "Well you can\u2019t have eyes on her 24/7 either. That\u2019s a horrible state to be in.", "Therapy and institutionalization are not the same thing!  That\u2019s such an unbelievably absurd exaggeration.\n\nTherapy will give your wife the skills to manage her moods.  It will help her learn when she needs to ask for help if she\u2019s becoming dangerous to herself.  It can restore her ability to have independence.\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is keeping her on a leash instead of helping her to learn to be safe on her own.  You\u2019re creating complete dependence on you.  You\u2019re removing her ability to be a whole person, and turning both of you into dysfunctional appendages of each other.\n\nTo give you an analogy that I hope you\u2019ll understand, this is like when someone loses a hand, and instead of giving them the tools and skills to regain their independence, you\u2019re feeding them and dressing them and bathing them and wiping their butt when they use the toilet.  The healthy thing is to help them with tools and new skills so that they can learn to do most things for themself, and don\u2019t need a constant attendant.  The goal is for the disabled person to be able to tend to their own needs, in a safe and healthy way.  That should be the goal with your wife, as well.", "Well\u2026 you have basically admitted that if you leave her alone for two seconds, her own behaviour/\u201cmoods\u201d might literally cause the same result.", "That\u2019s not what\u2019s being suggested nor is getting psychological help interchangeable with in-patient care. Your wife, at the very least, needs medication, most likely a mood stabilizer. \n\nThis whole literally-being-together-24/7 thing is not sustainable long-term. I know it seemed like a good idea after you returned from your trip to find out she\u2019d had an \u201caccident.\u201d But that was more of a band aid on top of much, much bigger issues. \n\nIn a normal, healthy relationship, you\u2019d be able to hang out with Dan one-on-one. What you\u2019re doing is the opposite of that. \n\nI\u2019m not going to pass a judgement here because I think you genuinely are trying to act in the best interest of your wife. The problem is what you\u2019re doing currently is *not* in her best interest or yours. \n\nShe needs help you cannot provide. She needs medication and therapy, but definitely meds first. Once she\u2019s stabilized, she can start therapy and most likely be much more open to it. Most places have virtual appointments now so she won\u2019t even have to leave home. Please check out the resources in your area. I know you love your wife, but at this point you\u2019re doing more harm than good.", "Eh, mental health supports all over the world have pretty notoriously bad reputations. If OP is in a place where mental health is even further behind, I cant necessarily write it off as controlling. Theyre the only ones with the full story.\n\nThey for sure both need some support though, even if all they could access is virtual counselling."]}
