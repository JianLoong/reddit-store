Sam is my oldest, i have 4 more children that are all still minors. Sam has been living with me and her siblings for a year. She left a bad relationship, and I offered for her to stay with me, rent free, as long as she wanted. My only stipulation was to help around the house, and either work or be in school.\n\nSam is an excellent daughter at home. She is a 4.0 student in college, works full time and babysits a few nights a week. She is super helpful with her siblings, keeps her space clean, helps around the house, etc. The problem is when she's not home.\n\nSam's best friends are a group of guys in their early 30's. She spends most of her free time with them, and will often sleep over at one of their houses on weekends. I don't love that, but she's an adult and can do as she pleases. My issue is her reckless behavior that I think they're to blame for. Sam recently bought a dirtbike, got into a crash, cut her leg open, then let one of the boys (not trained at all) give her 10 stitches in it. She goes on whitewater rafting trips with them, ski's avalanche terrain, rock climbs outdoors, goes to raves, stays out partying till 4am, hitchhikes around alaska, sleeps over at random guys houses, etc. Her brother (not my son) also recently told me that Sam invited him to a house party with her, where she was seen doing lines and smoking weed. I don't even like her drinking, so I am definitely not a fan of this.\n\nWe got into the other day when she was home, and I told her that if she continues to live this reckless lifestyle, she has to move out. Her dad said I'm being too hard on her, and that we should be happy she's finally living life after helping raise her siblings for years.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTLDR; daughter is behaving recklessly, i told her she has to move out if she continues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\n\nSam was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer about 18 months ago. (She went through treatment, and is in remission) That was when her whole personality changed. She left her relationship (which, no one was upset about. It was long overdue), and became an outdoorsy, risk taking, partying indivudal. She was never like this before, she seems happier now, but like i stated above, she's far too risky.", "created_utc": 1687374760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fghyc/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_if_she/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was gonna go with \"NAH\" until I saw your comment about how people think you put too much on her but you think it was fine since she didn't complain. That's called parentification and part of that is teaching the child they would be selfish and bad if they did complain. So what it sounds like is actually you saw her moving back in as free childcare but instead she's living her life and not doing enough of the \"help around the house\" you stipulated she do. \n\nSo kick her out if you want, it is your house after all, you're absolutely allowed to suddenly change the rules on her because she didn't immediately fall back into being a parent to your kids as you were hoping she would.

Do you think not living with you will make her change her ways? You're in your right to boot her, but the way you're doing it do make YTA.\n\nShe is following the house rules, and she's an adult, so I think it's a good idea to let her find her way.

Still, at some point you do have to let go.\n\nNow, it might not be a good idea for the two of you to live under the same roof, as it's obviously too hard for you to let her do her own thing.  That is something the two of you should sit down and discuss and come up with a good plan to make happen in an orderly fashion, without  hard feelings following the moving load.", "YTA some of those things you list are more concerning than others but nothing that warrants a kick out.

And you got mad when she was releasing stress with smoking?! Jesus...", "YTA- you ONLY have a few rules, work or be in school, help around the house.   She is doing that, long as she isnt coming home drunk, drinking in your house or doing drugs at home, this isnt something you get to control.  Because that is the issue here, she is not doing what you want.  There is nothing wrong with her rock climbing or rafting or having fun with friends. Sounds like she spent years being 'mommy' because you were not at home so now she is able to have some fun.", "YTA - By your own words she helped raised her siblings for years. Because of this she couldn't have a normal childhood/teen years / live her own life. You say that at home she is an excellent daughter as she is still helping raise her siblings, cleans and helps around the house. YTA for making her raise her siblings in the first place. You're double TA because she moved back in with the stipulation that she help around the house and work or stay in school and she has done that yet you are still trying to kick her out. You are triple the asshole because even though she is going above the stipulations you set, not doing drugs or alcohol in your house, and not giving you any kind of behavioral issues, you still want to kick her out. She's a grown adult. At 24 years old, who she hangs out with and what she does with them when she is not in your home is none of your business. What is your business is if she is respecting your home and your home rules which it sounds like she has done completely.", "YTA she's still getting good grades and working 12 hours shifts and babysitting when needed all while having fun away from your house where the younger kids will not see it. this is like the best case and your upset about it.

You only found out about the blow because her brother is a snitch.", "YTA. I encourage everyone to read OPs replies where they confirm they basically had Sam raise their children and now that Sam is living their own life, this upsets OP", "YTA\n\nYou made her a deal.  She's honoring that deal.  But because she does some scary things to you, you want to walk back your deal?  What the hell kind of person are you?  For real, what kind of person are you?  What you're doing is teaching your daughter to never trust you at your word.  That you will hold your end of deals as long as she does everything you want her to.  To include her life outside your home.\n\nThe tighter you hold onto her, the faster she will slip through your fingers.  Rules at home are one thing, and they seem reasonable.  But rules for her personal time outside of your home?  That's absolutely ridiculous.", "YTA, you agreed to let her live there under circumstances that she abides by. Her lifestyle is none of your business. It would be a good idea to talk to a therapist to try to discover why you feel the need to hold such control over your adult daughter\u2019s life. \n\nI hope you can find the compassion to give her space and allow her to heal and recover from her bad relationship without worrying about being kicked out onto the street by someone who is supposed to love her.", "Sorry, YTA. Because she\u2019s living her best life you don\u2019t like it? Do you want her to just care for her siblings, do to school and clean up around the house? Let the girl live a little. Remove umbilical cord, stop hovering, she\u2019s basically an adult. I\u2019m sure she appreciates living there but back off a bit. My mom did that to my brother.

So to summarise, you parentified her when she was young by forcing her to help raise her siblings, then set some admittedly reasonable rules for her behaviour in your house which you admit she is following. Now you want to evict her for doing things that normal teenagers do? The drugs are concerning but I promise you a lot of people have tried them at some point or the other. \n\nAlso if you want her to stop doing this how will throwing her out help? She doesn\u2019t do it at home so either she\u2019ll do it more or she was never doing it that much in the first place so you threw her out for nothing. Your logic doesn\u2019t add up.", "YTA, she\u2019s living life", "hope she gets outs, you seem more a jailer than a parent, you only want a babysitter.", "YTA", "I don't think you're an asshole per se, just being a concerned parent. But giving her ultimatums or trying to be in control of her life will make you the asshole. She's active and has friends which is good. Smoking weed is so normal now it's really a non-issue, except for people's opinions on it. Just the other stuff she wants to be careful with. But as long as she's able to hold a job, keep relationships, and maintain herself, she should be able to live her life. You're just going to push her away otherwise, or drive her to being more secretive with her activities.", "Lots of people seem to be missing the part where she invited her younger brother to a party she was doing coke at. (INFO is he a minor???) Or that she let one of her guy friends stitch her leg back together rather than going to the hospital??\n\nYTA for a bunch of the other reasons you listed having an issue with. She's obviously going buckwild now that she doesn't have to raise your kids and it's causing her to partake in some unsafe behaviors. That doesn't make her an asshole, it means dealing with some issues in a not so healthy way. Healthy well adjusted people don't take theses kinds of risks and do cocaine. You can keep your \"profession\" life afloat but still be drowing on your own time. How about instead of trying to make her homeless you say ask her to attend therapy to deal with the parentification and issues you gave her??\n\nEdit spelling is hard", "YTA. You let her stay at your house and make her do shit for you but then get mad when she does what she wants as well? making her take care of her younger siblings is an AH move too. They\u2019re YOUR kids and your responsibility. not hers. Take care of your own children.", "NAH. You have every right to make the rules in your house and, like you said, she's an adult and can do as she pleases. But your husband is right.

I had to let a good friend of mine go because he was determined to live dangerously and I couldn\u2019t stand by and watch it anymore. So I understand wanting to remove yourself from it by having her leave. BUT it sounds like she\u2019s being helpful around the house and keeping her grades up. Maybe you just got a wild child on your hands and she needs to settle down on her own in due time.", "NAH. Your daughter is an adult and can make as many mistakes as she needs to during these years in order to find herself. Everyone matures eventually (except incels, pick-mes and PUAs). If she's abiding by the rules of your home while she's there, that's where your authority over her ends.", "NAH.\n\nIt's your house and you can set the rules.  Her behavior certainly has the potential to be a negative influence on the minors in the house.\n\nIf your daughter can maintain a 4.0 and a full-time job, I'm amazed that she has any time for \"hitchhiking around Alaska\" or much of the rest of it.\n\nForcing her to move out will cause her to spend her money on rent, which reduces the amount she has to spend on her wild adventures.  But then again, she might just decide to move in with one of these male friends.  So be careful what you wish for.", "Sounds like she's living her best life!

If she refuses to stop doing drugs and prove it with testing, she shouldn't be around her younger siblings or expect you to subsidize her partying. \n\nIf she is adult enough to make these decisions, she should take on the responsibility of supporting herself.", "NTA.

To her it was probably normal and assumed she\u2019d be a brat for not \u2018helping\u2019 out her family hence the lack of \u2018complaining\u2019. \n\nfor your daughter to be doing risky things is well, no issue.

One wrong mine and you get an infection and amputation. \n\nBut the drugs in particular, after she took one of your young kids along? CPS would be called for the neglect and endangerment.

I had an ex who did coke so that does scare me and I think there needs to be a conversation about that piece of it. The stitches may be a youth issue. My very first day of my very first job in college I biked to work and fell and fractured my kneebone, but because I was 19 and thought I was invincible I worked 8 hours on it and I will never have feeling in that knee again. If she works that hard in school and work she may have thought to prioritize money in a really deleterious way by letting a friend do the stitches. \n\nThe cancer diagnosis should be obvious, her life was in question and so she decided to start doing some bucket list things. I find that the least surprising. I actually find it more surprising that it wasn\u2019t considered pertinent enough to make the first cut of the post, because I would guess the large part of the behavior stems from that. Also, the drug use could have begun related to pain. \n\nIf you decide to kick her out with a 4.0, a full time job and in healthy remission, don\u2019t expect that to all continue with her on the street. If your rules are more important to you than her future then by all means do it, but understand that you would be kicking her on her ass for a handful of bad behaviors. She won\u2019t shape up and become what you want with more struggles in her life.

Now whether that's because of parentification or just like normal asking a sibling to help out we don't know because Sam never spoke up and she's not here to tell her side of the story. It is totally possible that she felt like she was doing too much but didn't feel like she could voice it because she was seeing her own mother struggle. It's also possible that she didn't feel that way at all and just missed out on some experiences and is trying to have them now.", "\nIt's bold of you to assume that just single parents do this.....", "Then why are you so bothered by this?", "You sound like a wonderful parent.

I don't think you're \"not a parent\" to your children if you spend as much time with them as you can, but you have to turn over some of the childcare to the oldest so that you can work two jobs and keep food on the table. You're still parenting them, by doing the things that are most crucial to their survival *right then*, while finding ways for them still to have the rest of what they need even when it can't all come from you at once. \n\nIs this the best thing for your oldest, or indeed from any of them? Of course not. But it's what you've got.
