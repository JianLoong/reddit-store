The moment she told me I was a little speechless and just congratulated her.\n\nThe thing is, they met and started dating in January of this year. I thought her parents would have some objection to the marriage, but everyone seems to be happy about the occasion. This weekend she told me that they closed with a wedding planner and are already looking for places, but they are having a little bit of a tough time because they want to get married this year, and some venues are difficult in terms of availability.\n\nHonestly, since the engagement announcement I'm very worried about the speed at which everything is happening, they've only known each other for a few months and are they already going to make such a serious decision? \n\nAnd then when she told me she was in a hurry to get married too, I couldn't help myself, she's my best friend and I want her to be happy, so I said I thought maybe they were rushing things and asked why they didn't wait a bit to plan the ceremony. She was immediately offended and asked if I thought she was making a mistake and I told her the truth and said yes. I would like to point out that I have nothing against the groom, but I do think it is a mistake to marry someone you know so little about.\n\nShe got really upset and said she needed time from our friendship. I was really sad but I also understand how it could have hurt her, to have her best friend say something so important could be a mistake, and I just told her to talk to me when she was ready. Since then we have had no contact.\n\nWell, today her mom and fianc\u00e9 called me. Her mom said I was a huge asshole for hurting her daughter like that when clearly I was jealous because I'm single and I wanted to get a man like my friend's fiance, said also she was disgusted with me for wanting to destroy my friend's happiness. And the groom also called me and cursed me, saying that I shouldn't get involved in other people's relationships, to mind my own business, and that if it was for him I would never get close to her again.\n\nAnd I really don't know if I should try to take it back, to somehow stay a part of my best friend's life, or if I should stand my ground because I don't want to be someone who says nothing while someone I love makes a mistake. I understand that maybe I really am an asshole for having an opinion about a relationship I'm not involved in, and even considering someone's wedding a mistake, but I just felt like it was my job to at least talk to her. AITA?\n\nAlso, I would like to point out that the reason for the marriage is not a possible pregnancy, they are waiting till marriage.", "created_utc": 1682974304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1350wqx/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_that_getting/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's what a friend *should* do.\n\nAlso, it's quite common for people \"waiting for marriage\" to rush into marriage so they can stop waiting.", "Friends tell you what you want to hear.  Good friends tell you what you need to hear.\n\nIt does seem real quick, and the fianc\u00e9 ti threaten you with words like that is pretty worrisome too.  I wouldn\u2019t bet on this couple lasting, but unfortunately, your friend is probably always going to remember being unsupported even if it does.\n\nUnfortunately, may be best to let this friendship pass", "NTA\n\nYikes, it seems like you were as gentle as you could be about this.  Sadly nothing really good happens when you tell someone the truth like that.  Sounds like her fiance is a real piece of work.  I'd completely step away.  Esp since her mom and fiance acted like that.", "The last line is gold...now we know why the rush!\n\nNTA. You were expressing concern from a place of love for your friend, even though it was probably not wise or tactful to verbalise it.", "Just the way he reacted is showing how toxic he's gonna be.", "NTA. Friends don't let friends get married just so they can have sex. It IS way too fast. I would beg my kid to not get married if they were in this situation. Purity culture ruins so many lives.", "NTA. I know there will be plenty of people saying they got married after months and are still together 20 years later so it can work. But I think these stories are the exception not the norm. A few months of knowing someone is fast, especially when they\u2019re both pretty young, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be the only person to say it. As for her mother and fianc\u00e9 contacting you way out of line.", "Welp getting married so you can finally have sex is about the worst reason to get married I have ever heard. It is certainly the reason. NTA the only things you need from a friend and respect and honesty. Hope she knows what she's getting into", "NTA. A true friend will say the hard truths out loud.", "NTA- sorry but friends should be able to ask those type of questions.  Met in January, engaged and wanting to be married within the year is  a big rush to my mind too.    \nFriends should be able to say, Arent you going at this abit fast? You never told her to NOT get marriage just to wait to make sure its right.", "Nah getting married in your early twenties, and rushing to do that is just a bad idea lol. You gave her good advice, unfortunately A) your friend is immature and was seeking validation instead of actual advice B) her mom is immature as well [the immediate accusation of jealousy is adorable] C) the mom is the Fianc\u00e9's flying monkey. \n\nYou did your best, i'd just wipe my hands of it just end the friendship. The relationship is probably not going to be too pretty from the few details you gave and you seem like the empathetic sort, so watching that wouldn't be fun.\n\nI'm petty so i'd take out the popcorn but that's because i'm evil. don't be me. take care of yourself OP.\n\nedit: NTA just for clarity's sake", "Nta and your last lines explains the rush. Your friend mostly likely is make a big mistake. Who knows, it may work out but the odds are already lower than average.", "NTA, this is the reason for a fast wedding:\n\n>they are waiting till marriage.", "Nta. You're probably right. I married the person I was in love with 18, when we were 23 after being together for 5 years and we were divorced after one year.", "No you are not.  You are an excellent friend.", "NTA, she\u2019s not your friend.  If you can\u2019t offer advice without her telling her parents and fianc\u00e9 about it then you can\u2019t trust her.", "NTA, your friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and mother sound like complete trash for talking to you that way. Your friend is self-victimizing. She asked you what you thought and you told her the truth. \n\nMost marriages don\u2019t survive, the statistical probability that a rushed one would last is literally below 5%. This is basic math. You should get new friends that aren\u2019t trying to create a daytime soap opera out of their life.", "NTA .. there is actually chemical brain reasons why they are going so fast.. the \"honeymoon\" stage is an actual phase of relationships.. once a couple has been together long enough the brain chemistry changes again to a more settled established pattern between a couple.  They aren't in that phase yet so yes its too early.. can they get there?

I have a feeling you're going to need to let this friendship go. At least for a while.", "INFO - are they super conservative no sex till marriage people?   \n\nNTA- whoa slow her down lady. Take the time before making a long term decision. Trust me- a bad marriage defines a large portion of your life forever", "NTA, but the reaction you received isn't surprising. Sometimes all you can do for a friend is be there when they come to the conclusion they fucked up on their own.  She's love drunk and in love with love.  Logic isn't welcome.", "NTA - when those people attacked you there was clearly something up. BF, mom and fiance all at once is a huge red flag. You've done what you can, be there for her when it all goes south.", "Sounds like their reasons for getting married are ridiculous, and you\u2019re right-it\u2019s not smart to marry someone you\u2019ve only known a few months.\n\nHe also sounds controlling based on the phone call you had with him!\n\nNTA and sorry about your friend OP.", "NTA. You said your piece. Unfortunately she\u2019s not likely to consider your concerns. You can either stand by her side and watch her while she makes what probably is a stupid decision or go off into the sunset alone. Up to you.", "NTA.. the speed at which the relationship moved forward caused you to feel concerned for your friend and you just asked her if she was sure about the whole thing. There was no pressure or bad intentions from your side. Your conscience is clear and your intentions were genuine.  Let it go and pray what you fear doesn't happen. She should have understood where you were coming from. You are better off without her.", "NTA. I did the same thing with one of my closest friends. Slightly different surrounding circumstances, but I just asked if he was sure, that they'd only been dating a few months, etc. If you genuinely care about someone, you do the hard things. \n\nYou were less of an ahole than I was. You at least waited for her to ask. I just point blank asked without waiting.", "ESH.\n\nI feel like if you ask your own *best friend* a difficult question, you deserve an honest answer. If you aren't getting an honest answer, there's something wrong with the friendship. So when your friend said, \"Do you think I'm making a mistake?\" she invited the response & you were right to speak your mind. \n\nThat being said, even best friends need to be careful when it comes to getting in between a friend and their romantic partner. Most often, when made to choose, people will toss years of friendship down the drain and choose their romantic partner.\n\nBasically: your friend offered you a landmine and you stepped on it. \n\nAnyone who's been around the block a time or two knows this, so it was on you to phrase your worries in a way that would reach your friend. If your friend hadn't outright asked, you would DEFINITELY be the asshole.\n\nAnd the people who called you up to swear at you were 100% assholes, doubt I need to explain why.", "NTA. You were right to tell your friend it was a mistake. What 2 grown adults (her mom and fiance) call and berate you like that?!", "Don't ask the question you don't want the answer to. NTA.", "YTA. You don't know that she's making a mistake, tho. That's just your opinion. A lot of people get married only knowing each other a short time and their marriage last forever. But then there's people who have been together for 10 years they get married and end up getting divorced a year later. Unless you have a crystal ball you are not going to be able to see the future. It's great that you love your friend so much and want her to be happy, but sometimes the best thing you can do is just support them no matter what their decisions are and to keep our opinions to ourselves. And unfortunately I think you've destroyed this friendship and there's going to be no going back.", "ESH, but I have learned first hand by voicing a similar opinion with a friend whose been in a much longer relationship when they got engaged. It can feel like your responsibility to voice your opinion, but you also have to take a moment and think about if you were the madly in love, newly engaged one. Do you want your best friend to shit on it (even nicely), or do you want their full support in your big life choice? At the end of the day, mistake or no mistake, it\u2019s hers to make and learn from. I got lucky and when I told my friend my thoughts on her now hubby, she was delicate with what she shared with him in regards to that so there\u2019s no hard feelings on his end towards me. Your friend kind of put a strain on that for you and him to have a good relationship at this point in time, but it\u2019s not to say years and support going forward can\u2019t mend it. My advice would be to apologize for what you said and emphasize that it came from a place of love. Let her know you\u2019re here to support whatever decision she makes because at the end of the day she knows her relationship better than you do. I wouldn\u2019t put your foot down here\u2026", "ESH even though I know that might not be popular \n\nIn my 20s, I would have absolutely agreed with all the NTA comments. Mid-30s me has a policy that sometimes it's best to mind your business when it comes to other people's relationships. \n\nAlso, if they're waiting until marriage, they're getting married because they want to bone. A mistake? Absolutely. But it's theirs to make", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry. I think you are genuinely concerned about her. But - and this is very important - no one asked for your opinion. You just couldn't keep it in so you opened the subject and offended her. Had your friend solicited your advice, you would have owed her your honesty. Instead, your unsolicited opinion was registered as judgement and pontification. Her mother and fiance are asshats themselves. But accept responsibility for overstepping. You judged your friend and now you are bearing the consequences.", "ESH. It sucks but butting your head into other people's relationship really never works out because people are gonna do what they want regardless.\n\nThe comment about waiting till marriage is the answer you are looking for into why they are rushing marriage.\n\nYour friends mom + groom also sound like an AH for those comments to you.", "NAH. It's so hard to say what will or won't work out. I've known people who dated for 3 years who got divorced in under 5 years...and people who dated for under a year who are still together after decades. You voiced your opinion - which is only looking out for the best interest of your friend. She disagrees. I don't see why the conversation went past that...unless there's more to the story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
