The moment she told me I was a little speechless and just congratulated her.\n\nThe thing is, they met and started dating in January of this year. I thought her parents would have some objection to the marriage, but everyone seems to be happy about the occasion. This weekend she told me that they closed with a wedding planner and are already looking for places, but they are having a little bit of a tough time because they want to get married this year, and some venues are difficult in terms of availability.\n\nHonestly, since the engagement announcement I'm very worried about the speed at which everything is happening, they've only known each other for a few months and are they already going to make such a serious decision? \n\nAnd then when she told me she was in a hurry to get married too, I couldn't help myself, she's my best friend and I want her to be happy, so I said I thought maybe they were rushing things and asked why they didn't wait a bit to plan the ceremony. She was immediately offended and asked if I thought she was making a mistake and I told her the truth and said yes. I would like to point out that I have nothing against the groom, but I do think it is a mistake to marry someone you know so little about.\n\nShe got really upset and said she needed time from our friendship. I was really sad but I also understand how it could have hurt her, to have her best friend say something so important could be a mistake, and I just told her to talk to me when she was ready. Since then we have had no contact.\n\nWell, today her mom and fianc\u00e9 called me. Her mom said I was a huge asshole for hurting her daughter like that when clearly I was jealous because I'm single and I wanted to get a man like my friend's fiance, said also she was disgusted with me for wanting to destroy my friend's happiness. And the groom also called me and cursed me, saying that I shouldn't get involved in other people's relationships, to mind my own business, and that if it was for him I would never get close to her again.\n\nAnd I really don't know if I should try to take it back, to somehow stay a part of my best friend's life, or if I should stand my ground because I don't want to be someone who says nothing while someone I love makes a mistake. I understand that maybe I really am an asshole for having an opinion about a relationship I'm not involved in, and even considering someone's wedding a mistake, but I just felt like it was my job to at least talk to her. AITA?\n\nAlso, I would like to point out that the reason for the marriage is not a possible pregnancy, they are waiting till marriage.", "created_utc": 1682974304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1350wqx/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_that_getting/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know there will be plenty of people saying they got married after months and are still together 20 years later so it can work. But I think these stories are the exception not the norm.

Sometimes all you can do for a friend is be there when they come to the conclusion they fucked up on their own.  She's love drunk and in love with love.  Logic isn't welcome.", "NTA - when those people attacked you there was clearly something up. BF, mom and fiance all at once is a huge red flag.

You said your piece. Unfortunately she\u2019s not likely to consider your concerns.

Up to you.", "NTA.. the speed at which the relationship moved forward caused you to feel concerned for your friend and you just asked her if she was sure about the whole thing. There was no pressure or bad intentions from your side. Your conscience is clear and your intentions were genuine.  Let it go and pray what you fear doesn't happen. She should have understood where you were coming from. You are better off without her.", "NTA. I did the same thing with one of my closest friends. Slightly different surrounding circumstances, but I just asked if he was sure, that they'd only been dating a few months, etc. If you genuinely care about someone, you do the hard things. \n\nYou were less of an ahole than I was. You at least waited for her to ask. I just point blank asked without waiting.", "ESH.\n\nI feel like if you ask your own *best friend* a difficult question, you deserve an honest answer. If you aren't getting an honest answer, there's something wrong with the friendship. So when your friend said, \"Do you think I'm making a mistake?\" she invited the response & you were right to speak your mind. \n\nThat being said, even best friends need to be careful when it comes to getting in between a friend and their romantic partner. Most often, when made to choose, people will toss years of friendship down the drain and choose their romantic partner.\n\nBasically: your friend offered you a landmine and you stepped on it. \n\nAnyone who's been around the block a time or two knows this, so it was on you to phrase your worries in a way that would reach your friend. If your friend hadn't outright asked, you would DEFINITELY be the asshole.\n\nAnd the people who called you up to swear at you were 100% assholes, doubt I need to explain why.", "NTA. You were right to tell your friend it was a mistake. What 2 grown adults (her mom and fiance) call and berate you like that?!", "Don't ask the question you don't want the answer to. NTA.", "YTA. You don't know that she's making a mistake, tho. That's just your opinion. A lot of people get married only knowing each other a short time and their marriage last forever. But then there's people who have been together for 10 years they get married and end up getting divorced a year later. Unless you have a crystal ball you are not going to be able to see the future. It's great that you love your friend so much and want her to be happy, but sometimes the best thing you can do is just support them no matter what their decisions are and to keep our opinions to ourselves. And unfortunately I think you've destroyed this friendship and there's going to be no going back.", "ESH, but I have learned first hand by voicing a similar opinion with a friend whose been in a much longer relationship when they got engaged. It can feel like your responsibility to voice your opinion, but you also have to take a moment and think about if you were the madly in love, newly engaged one. Do you want your best friend to shit on it (even nicely), or do you want their full support in your big life choice? At the end of the day, mistake or no mistake, it\u2019s hers to make and learn from. I got lucky and when I told my friend my thoughts on her now hubby, she was delicate with what she shared with him in regards to that so there\u2019s no hard feelings on his end towards me. Your friend kind of put a strain on that for you and him to have a good relationship at this point in time, but it\u2019s not to say years and support going forward can\u2019t mend it. My advice would be to apologize for what you said and emphasize that it came from a place of love. Let her know you\u2019re here to support whatever decision she makes because at the end of the day she knows her relationship better than you do. I wouldn\u2019t put your foot down here\u2026", "ESH even though I know that might not be popular \n\nIn my 20s, I would have absolutely agreed with all the NTA comments. Mid-30s me has a policy that sometimes it's best to mind your business when it comes to other people's relationships. \n\nAlso, if they're waiting until marriage, they're getting married because they want to bone. A mistake? Absolutely. But it's theirs to make", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry. I think you are genuinely concerned about her. But - and this is very important - no one asked for your opinion. You just couldn't keep it in so you opened the subject and offended her. Had your friend solicited your advice, you would have owed her your honesty. Instead, your unsolicited opinion was registered as judgement and pontification. Her mother and fiance are asshats themselves. But accept responsibility for overstepping. You judged your friend and now you are bearing the consequences.", "ESH. It sucks but butting your head into other people's relationship really never works out because people are gonna do what they want regardless.\n\nThe comment about waiting till marriage is the answer you are looking for into why they are rushing marriage.\n\nYour friends mom + groom also sound like an AH for those comments to you.", "NAH. It's so hard to say what will or won't work out. I've known people who dated for 3 years who got divorced in under 5 years...and people who dated for under a year who are still together after decades. You voiced your opinion - which is only looking out for the best interest of your friend. She disagrees.

It's not like you were constantly pestering her with your opinion.", ">She was immediately offended and asked if I thought she was making a mistake\n\nThat (*to me*) shows that she is unsure about it too.\n\nBecause why would THAT be her first thought?\n\nThey have been together for 4 months AT BEST.........Yes, it is a mistake to get married that fast.\n\nCould it work out and they stay together forever? Yes, but if it does, WHY RUSH?\n\nJust be engaged for a year and start planning after your first anniversary..........\n\n>Her mom said I was a huge asshole for hurting her daughter like that when clearly I was jealous because I'm single and I wanted to get a man like my friend's fiance.\n\nLOL!!!! Okay.........\n\n>she was disgusted with me for wanting to destroy my friend's happiness\n\nHow did you try to \"destroy her happiness\"?\n\nBy telling her how you feel? Again, how is THAT their first thought if there is no truth to what you said?\n\n>the groom also called me and cursed me, saying that I shouldn't get involved in other people's relationships\n\nAnd what is HE doing now? Getting involved in other people's relationships............\n\nAlso, cursing at someone you barely know like that......classy!!!\n\nBut i guess he's good at \"jumping the gun\".\n\n>I really don't know if I should try to take it back, to somehow stay a part of my best friend's life\n\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t take it back, not unless you didn't mean it.\n\n>I understand that maybe I really am an asshole for having an opinion about a relationship I'm not involved in\n\nYou are involved in it tho, it's your best friend.\n\n>Also, I would like to point out that the reason for the marriage is not a possible pregnancy, they are waiting till marriage.\n\n**THERE IT IS!!!!! They just want to get laid........**\n\nYou didn't do ANYTHING wrong, you gave your opinion.\n\nYou didn't tell her that the relationship is a mistake, only that it\u2019s a mistake to rush marriage when there is absolutely no reason for it.\n\nNTA at all.", "Yeaaa they met and either want to bone, got caught boning, or is bringing a \"happy accident\" caused from boning and they want to get married quickly to either start boning or to hide the pregnancy. Now you said that can't be true because they are waiting for marriage but to fully be that person it happens all the time people break that vow or end up having to have a rush wedding. Now sure there's a possibility that this could work out and you won't be seeing a child in six months. Sure it happens that people just meet someone and know and end up together for years. But it's not terrible for you to question something like this and she's either not a real friend and wants an echo chamber, pregnant, or in a toxic relationship that she's not able to see judging from her reaction", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t thank you said anything hurtful. I think you were just stating what is commonly held belief. People should not get married quickly. And under a year is a really quick turnaround for anyone to get married in the century.\n\nShe probably took it personally because she was having worries and she\u2019s breaking social norms and conventions. She might also have taken it really personally because maybe she thought she was rushing things and she didn\u2019t know how to back up. Like being proposed, you can be very exciting and your feelings can sweet your way and then rationality hits you like a cold gust of air an hour or two later.\n\nYou also did it in a very respectful manner. \n\nI think this just might be a sign that may be your friendship was not as strong as you thought it was. Or maybe how your friend conceptualizes relationships is in a very unhealthy way. Friends tell Friend the truth, but in gentle and graceful ways\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone. A lot of people have had friendships blow up for a moment because they\u2019ve had friends go significant other crazy. \n\nTake solace in your other friends and just shake it off. Let it roll off you and just let time do it\u2019s magic. And if she doesn\u2019t come back, that\u2019s fine. You did your best in your friendship and did where it needed and you may not be what you wanted it to end on.", "NTA. They should just use the soaking loophole that is popular in Utah.", "NTA... she asked, you answered.  My guess is they are rushing in so they can have sex... I had several really religious friends who did the same after high school.  Most of those marriages did not work out...", "NTA. Because frankly you are not wrong. They haven\u2019t even been dating a year. You have said your part (only when asked). There is nothing left to do. Sadly sometimes you have to let people  just make their mistakes and live with the consequences.\nAlso don\u2019t pick up the phone two years from now when they are looking for a free babysitter.", "NTA - you probably could have phrased it better, something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m just worried about how fast you\u2019re moving\u201d rather than \u201cI think you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d But still NTA.\n\n>And I really don't know if I should try to take it back, to somehow stay a part of my best friend's life, or if I should stand my ground because I don't want to be someone who says nothing while someone I love makes a mistake. \n\nIf you\u2019re close to her, I would advise taking it back, at least to an extent. You can say something along the lines of you were concerned about the speed, but you love her and support her if this is what she wants. The main thing is you want her to know that she can depend on you as a friend if (or when) her marriage falls apart.", "op=YTA\n\nNot your business, stick your nose out next time\n\nHowever, Her mom and her Fianc\u00e9 having your phone number to harass you?  IF she gave it to them--she sucks for that.", "YTA for not qualifying your response to her as you did to Reddit.", "NTA your friend is moving way too fast . She should at least take a year to get to know him more before making such a huge decision. \n\n\u201cThe groom also called me and cursed me, saying that I shouldn\u2019t get involved in other people\u2019s relationships, to mind my own business, and that if it was for him I would never get close to her again\u201d \n\nit sounds like from what the fianc\u00e9 told you, there\u2019s already red flags with him. Sounds like HE needs to mind his own business and stay out of yalls friendship instead. He sounds very controlling of her already.", "Imagine the post nut clarity that would hit you", "My parents got married after 5 months of knowing each other and have been together for 40 years. They\u2019ve been on the verge of divorce for 30 years and my dad just recently confessed that he\u2019s been cheating for 20 - so fun! \n\nSeriously folks, get to know your partner before you marry them.", "I disagree because when discussing issues with booking on short notice, the the friend said \"do you think we're making a mistake?\" in response to \"why don't you take some time to plan the ceremony?\" which means she was specifically asking for an answer to that question. OP's question could easily just be small talk relating to trying to assuage worries about not being able to speed up bookings.  \nIf OP had just blurted out \"You're making a mistake!\" that would be diff  \n\n\nNTA OP - also your edit about how \"they're not pregnant cause they're waitin for marriage\" is your answer as to why they're rushing it. They want sexy time ASAP."]}
