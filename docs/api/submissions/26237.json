If you haven't been able to have a vacation with your mom in 7 years, I can see why you picked time with your mom.  Who planned the trip first?

If I didn't want to go, they would just update me on how much fun they're having and would ask me how I'm doing, not skip to  guilt tripping me by using my sisters against me. They know that's not my ultimate responsibility. Si OP, don't feel bad for not going. If your dad was anything like mine, they should have been happy for both you and your mom.", "NTA.  If it was really so almighty important to them that you be there, then why did they schedule the trip for dates that they knew you already had plans?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you why - because they think they\u2019re better than your Mom.  They have more money, they can plan more extravagant trips, and they\u2019re generally just so full of themselves that it didn\u2019t occur to them that you *wouldn\u2019t* just jump at the chance to ditch your Mom for them.  \n\nThey\u2019re also still salty about this because they were probably banking on you being essentially the 3rd \u201cadult\u201d on the trip.  Partially for the potential to treat you like a nanny - like I\u2019m betting your Dad and Stepmom were planning to have one room for themselves, and then stick you in a 2nd \u201ckids\u201d room to watch over the three kids for them.  So no sleep or rest or break from the kids for you.  \n\nAnd partially for 3rd \u201cadult\u201d logistics - a lot of rides seat people in pairs, and with you going along, each of the 3 kids would have a different \u201cadult\u201d to sit with.  So the potential for you being able to ever go off and do your own thing, like taking a break, or riding some non-little kid rides?  Probably nil.\n\nAnd all that is not cool.  None of it takes you and what you need/want into consideration.  They\u2019re only thinking about themselves and what you can do for them.  \n\nSo I\u2019d have a discussion with your Dad about how disappointed you are in their attitudes.  That him not just expecting, but basically *demanding* that you show him & his family favoritism over your mom is manipulative and gross.  You simply won\u2019t do it.

You should not have been put into a position to have to choose in the first place) (2) for trying to make you feel guilty for their poor planning, and (3) for being so inconsiderate of you and your mom. \n\nI\u2019m sure you would enjoy a vacation with your younger siblings, but not at the expense of a special, and long awaited trip with your mom. I hope your dad and step mom wise up and realize that this sort of thing is only going to make you resent your situation. Please try to remember that it is them who are the AHs and not your younger siblings, though.  If your dad and stepmom damage your relationship with your siblings (or if they have a worse trip since you can\u2019t be there) then they are innocent victims as well.", "Also, what the fuck is this idea that this is a \u201cspecial moment\u201d or an essential milestone in any way??\n\nNever trust a grown adult who thinks anything related to the Disney corporation is some kind of universal childhood milestone.

I was the youngest of four, and my sisters were annoyed and bickering teenagers at the time. I was big enough to ride and enjoy the grown up roller coasters, but for some reason Pirates of the Caribbean scared the crap out of me.\n\nI got a Minnie Mouse T-shirt at Disneyland and later that trip, a seagull shit on the shirt at Sea World, during the shamu show.

The youngest wont be able to go on all of the rides bc of their size. So unless everyone wants to forego the big kid rides the family will be split up.

She was 3 yo. My stepdaughter (now 12) would have been crushed if we had gone without her. \n\nI think the way you said you didn't care a about doing things with siblings probably came across as rude and hurt their feelings.

The thing is, they didn't *ask* the uncle first.  The uncle was an adult, with no children, and had absolutely zero interest in a disney cruise...let alone being in the same single cabin as the kids.  The family criticized the uncle really harshly, even tried the guilt route \"The kids were so upset that their favorite uncle refused to go on vacation with them...they've been crying for days\".\n\nSeveral of the comments said the same thing you suggested.....the kids don't give a shit if their uncle is there or not.

Dad's second marriage, new kids = \"I'm gonna fix the mistakes I made with the old family.\"\n\nMy father divorced my mother and remarried when I was very young, so I don't really remember a time when he lived with us.  He was very much a \"weekend dad\" very soon after remarrying.  We didn't exist to him outside of his court-mandated 8 hours on Saturday.\n\nI asked him to take me to my pee-wee soccer team's \"Father Son Day\" at Six Flags.  Everything was already paid for by the team.  His answer?  \"Why would I want to go to that?  I'll just be standing around with a bunch of dads I don't know.\"\n\nWhen I told him I wanted to be a baseball player when I grew up, he said \"That'll never happen.  Those guys play every day their whole lives.  You're not even in little league.\"  When I asked him to sign me up for little league...his answer was \"That's what I send your mother checks for.\"\n\nThen....my half-sister was born.  He turned into Ward Cleaver...for my half-sister.  My sisters and I continued to be \"the others\".\n\nI asked him to take me to a Yankee game because I was a big fan and had never been to one.  He said it would be too expensive because it wouldn't be \"fair\" if we didn't bring everyone.  The very next week, he told me that he brought my half-sister to a baseball game and how much fun she had.\n\nThe **one time** he went to one of my high school baseball games...he left in the first inning. \"Why am I here?  You're not even starting.\"  Of course, he raved about my half-sister's soccer, softball, swimming, etc; events.\n\nWe didn't speak for the last 20 years of his life.  I didn't visit him in the hospital when he had his stroke.  I didn't attend his funeral.  I was  39 at that point.  I didn't do it out of hatred...I had put most of that past me by then.  I didn't go because it had been decades since he had been even remotely part of my life.  He was as much a stranger to me as the guy across from me on the subway.\n\nMy oldest sister did visit him in the hospital, and attend the funeral.  So you can imagine my surprise, and ultimately...my *amusement* when I heard that family #2 (including my half-sister) was shocked and offended by my absence.  Apparently I was \"hateful and disrespectful\" and my father was \"A great, loving dad.\"\n\nAnyway.....any remote connection to them died with my father.

Then they dwelled on their thoughts too much. Hurt feelings. \n\nAlso, I suspect they see their kids talking about you in awe. I was the same way with the older kids in my life when I was young. \nThey want you around they just need to understand that as an older kid you want to do older kid stuff sometimes. I suggests trying to communicate to them that you do love them & you are sorry their feelings are hurt but sometimes you want to do stuff with your mom or on your own too.", "They will get over it, you're not at fault here. If they bring it up again I would mention two things:\n\nIf he had confirmed that you could have actually gone then of course you would have been there, you haven't been on a holiday with mum in years and I'm sure he knows it.\n\nLook at step mum and ask if she thinks her children like you (OP) more than her? It's not meaning to be rude it's just a fact that mum will always come first. It doesn't mean you done love the kids.", "It baffles me that Disney parks have such a grip on people that it's seen as some essential childhood experience.", "Well if his feelings are hurt, maybe OP's Dad could have done a better job facilitating OP into the family of his new wife and new children, and then OP possibly wouldn't have Peace Out chosen to live with Mom full time when the chance arose. Because reading between these \\*very\\* familiar lines? OP was replaced by Dad, and stepmom was complicit in that.\n\nOP's situation is not yours.\n\nOP's Dad and stepmom have enough income for multiple vacations.\n\nOP's Mom doesn't and scrimped/saved for one trip in many years.\n\nOP's Dad and stepmom scheduled their trip knowing it overlapped with OP's Mom. \n\nWhen they didn't accept OP's decision and pushed, OP let them know it's time to take off the rose tinted glasses.\n\nOP's Dad and stepmom are responsible for their alleged hurt feelings..and, by the way...for their low-key bullying.", "But that's not what dad said, he said you won't experience \"the kids first Disney trip\" not \"our first trip  all together \"", "That\u2019s why my one and only trip to Disneyland (late 70s, the only time we went to USA) when I was 12 was so disappointing that I can still feel it now. We get there and my Dad suddenly declares \u201cwe will only do things or go on rides that all of us can do together.\u201d My youngest sibling was two years old. So, no fun rides for me & the 10 year old.", "OMG, my heart hurts for you! That is completely ridiculous and there is no reason you and the 10 YO couldn't have ridden a few rides together!", "It's what we did.  Had to schedule any appointments that would give me a two week leeway to put in for time off.  Emergencies didn't count but you'd better come in with a legitimate written excuse or you'd get written up.", "Sadly, there are some companies/bosses that will even demand you put a request in at least a month or two in advance. Even then, you weren't supposed to book anything until final approval. If you did and they denied it, 'too bad.'"]}
