If you haven't been able to have a vacation with your mom in 7 years, I can see why you picked time with your mom.  Who planned the trip first?

Even if you weren\u2019t expected to be a third set of hands (i\u2019m guessing they banked on it), you will be doing mostly kiddie activities and not have fun. If they were thinking of your enjoyment too they might have allowed you to bring a friend.  \n\nHaving vacation time with your mom is important too.\n\nNot wanting to hang out with your siblings 24x7 doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t love them. You are at an age where you would want to things with friends of your own age. Don\u2019t let Dad manipulate you", "This has nothing to do with making disney visit special. They only want you there as a babysitter. Go enjoy your Disney vacation with your mum.", "NTA dad and stepmum were delusional thinking a sixteen year old would care that much about seeing younger half siblings experience Disney. You didn\u2019t lead anyone on they made the mistake of assuming being older meant you\u2019d think like a third parent. Post says that despite dads house having more money OP has been choosing to stay more with mum in the last year that should have been some indication.", "NTA - I'm sorry, but I'm of the opinion that Disney is a miserable time for everyone with kids aged 5 and younger.\nMiserable for the parents, who likely has to lug around a stroller and/or a diaper bag.  Miserable for the 4 yr old or younger (who likely won't even remember any of it as they get older), and miserable for anyone else that has to suffer being around them in the parks.\nOP's dad/stepmom are either looking for someone to shoulder the burden of watching the 4yo while they go on rides with the 6 and 8yo, or they're absolutely naive and/or weaponizing vacations against OP's mom.", "They didn't get kid-free time at a big amusement park. And they have a misplaced sense of 'family'. NTA. Be glad you made memories with your mother.", "NAH - you have done nothing wrong.   You have limited options to vacation with your mother who brought you into the world.  Don't let this bring you down.   You are not \"leading everyone one\" by having your own interests in your own important relationships.  You are going to encounter many more situations like this where you have to stand up for yourself.  You are basically an army of one.  Do yourself proud.", "NTA\n\nIf it was so critical to have all the kids together, they should have coordinated with you and your mother far in advance.", "NTA - I don\u2019t see why it would matter to you. Why do they think it would be important for you to see the little kids first reaction to Disney. I don\u2019t get that at all. Seems more to the story from the parents perspective that they aren\u2019t telling you.", "NTA they are being manipulative. They just wanted an extra pair of hands to wrangle three excited kids at Disney. Since when is going to Disney for the first time an actual milestone? You know is an actual milestone? Your mom saving up enough to take you on vacation.", "NTA. im sorry but \u201cfirst disney trip\u201d milestone? that\u2019s not a life milestone, it\u2019s a milestone for people who are obsessed with disney and have enough wealth to finance that trip. it\u2019s not a high school graduation or a wedding or a real milestone.", "NTA and they just wanted you to watch the kids while they fucked off.", "NTA, for all the reasons you laid out. I think you communicated well.", "NTA. They are mad that you weren't there to witness your half siblings excitement? So they admit that this vacation wasn't about you having fun, it was about watching the other kids have fun. That's such an odd selling point.\n\nMore likely they wanted you to even out the number for rides and have some time to themselves.\n\nParents care about firsts, siblings, not so much.", "You increasingly spend most of your time at your Mum's. So what you said shouldn't have been a shock to them. \n\nI suspect your Dad and StepMum have been in denial about what your absence from the their home meant. They might have told themselves your Mum was leaning on you emotionally, or pressuring you to stay over at hers, and that's why you weren't around as much. And that's why you telling them, \"no, hanging out with my Mum is my preference\" shocked them and hurt their feelings. NTA your behaviour made your feelings obvious.", "Since when did \"first time at Disney\" become a landmark life event?\n\nNTA.", "That's my bet too.", "\"He figured I wouldn't want to miss out on my half siblings experiencing it for the first time,\" \nYeah. It has that tone that it's the half siblings it's all about. And OP would be there to take care of them as the loving big sister.

But we have nothing in common considering they\u2019re 10 and 14 years older. I wanted them there for milestones like graduating, milestone-birthdays, etc., but that\u2019s it. We were, are and always will be at completley different stages of our lives. I got a phonecall every time one of them became a parent, I wasn\u2019t at the hospital. I didn\u2019t even visit for weeks, until I knew they had settled at Home with a baby.

Too bad for him that OP isn't in on that.", "It might be more accurate to say that he cares more about *himself* than OP.", ">You're still a kid, you shouldn't be expected to handle every social situation with grace,\n\nThis, yeah. Putting this kind of expectation on a 16yo and claiming it means she's not caring is cruel - but on dad's and stepmom's side.", "Honestly, this isn't about \"handling anything with grace.\" It's about her dad putting HIS responsibilities and milestones on HER. Yeah, I got excited when my son took his first steps, ate his first food, etc. I didn't DEMAND that his much older sister (8\u00bd years older) witness every first and act a certain way. He's my kid, not hers. OP's dad needs to stop putting adult responsibilities (the emotional kind, in this case) on his literal OTHER CHILD, OP.", "My mom started talking about it first. I also knew about the one with her first. Dad's was more official first but I knew mom was limited on the time she could take off work.", "I'm not the unofficial babysitter.

It\u2019s a theme park ffs not a life changing experience.", "I wonder if the dad scheduled things at the same time on purpose.

Could we choose a different weekend to drive to Chicago?\"", "Wasn't dad's time. Dad doesn't have any official time anymore. I go over whenever I want to.", "I really don't think babysitting is the motive. I'd expect a history of being forced to babysit if that was happening.", "This is a massive leap and factually inaccurate. OPs telling over and again in the comments that she's NOT used for child care. Don't encourage selfish and ungrateful interpretation of events based on your own projection here.", "I knew about mom's first but nothing was finalized with hers until after dad finalized his. I had not told him I would be going but he booked anyway. Mom was waiting to find out when her job would give her time off. Dad assumed since Disney and my half siblings would be going. But I always wanted the time and experience with my mom.", "My mom couldn't. She was relying on when she could get time off work. Dad booked without confirmation from me that I would be able to go.", "I bet that was the whole reason they wanted her to go to start with!", "It's so obvious now you point it out, and OP would have been expected to stay with the children that were too small for the rides, which might well be all 3 of them.", "Yup. And O can stay in the hotel room with the kids in the evening while the parents go out for a drink or two\u2026", "Or parents could take turns with the kids. It's not like we are talking about a single parent with no help here.", "And what adult rides is op going to enjoy with her young siblings? \n\n0\n\nYeah. They needed a sitter & extra ride partner. The 8 & 4 year old probably won't enjoy the same rides. They wanted to make their time less stressful & more enjoyable at op's expense.", "I can already ear all the \"family helps family\" and \"after all we've done for you...\".", "Kid getting driver\u2019s license is awesome and all, but going to amusement park is not an achievement", "Well, that makes it worse.\n\nIf they cared so much about you going to disneyland with them they could have scheduled it sometime you were free. Consideration has to go both ways.\n\nAs if disneyland is such a big deal, you're 16 not a little kid that gets all excited about princesses & mickey mouse. Let them go to the child activity with the children while you do your stuff.", "They just want to do a long babysit.", "That's a common problem that some parents try to make everyone do the same things though kids of different ages have different interests.\n\nThey have some idea in their head about perfect idyllic harmony, but in reality forced togetherness just creates arguments & ppl coming resentfully & being in sour mood.\n\nLoving each other does not mean doing everything together & not having your own life. Not just in families but also friendships and romances. But especially families when you're at an age where you're supposed to be getting more independent. They seem to still be treating you like a little kid, expecting you to get excited about disney & telling your mom what they think your feelings are rather than asking you. They need to realize that you've grown up.\n\nI have 4 siblings so there was always at least one person who didn't want to come - either I wouldn't want to come to a children's circus, or the smaller kids would be bored with sitting at a restaurant.  But my father would often force the unwilling person by the hairs rather than let them stay home & do something else so everyone's happy.... it was so much uneccesary grief, like my little sister just pouting & crying the whole time because she didn't wanna be there, or us older kids not being able to enjoy things due to having to babysit.\n\nSo maybe that's an angle you could use in discussion. \"It's not like I don't care about my siblings but Disneyland is for children, just go there with the smaller kids\"\n\nThough there is some extra inconsiderateness in your case since you only rarely get a chance to do vacation with your mom. They're expecting all the sacrifice & consideration to come from you. You can do vacation with them many times (maybe even when they're doing something less child-centric) but you get fewer chances with your mom. So you're absolutely not the A", "I'm truly interested for what reason you're expected to go other than cos the younger kids want to go? Fine, take them and enjoy, but WHY do you need them to be there for that?", "Many rides would need a parent or older sibling to accompany the youngsters. Three small children, two adults, one adolescent. That's their formula.", "If you knew you had a vacation tentatively booked for that time and didn't tell your Dad, then I still say, YTA, you need to learn to communicate better. Good learning for next time.", "Definitely agree! NTA", "Or for OP to go on the rides they didn\u2019t want to go on but the sibs did.", "Agree. And because of that age difference, they\u2019re not even gonna be interrested in the same things in an amusement park. The kids will most likely be at the kid-friendlier rides, playgrounds, facepainting, not really What most 16yo wanna spend their trip on (from my own familyexperience). \n\nNo, they need to let the kids find their own balance, because that kind of agedifference Can quickly become..indifferent, in a lack of better words. I\u2019ve experienced that too, and it took for our mom to 1000% butt out, to make us close again, but we\u2019re not \u2018friends\u2019. We\u2019re siblings, we love eachother, we have *our* own dynamic, but we\u2019re not \u2018friends\u2019 that just meet up and hang out, maybe once/thrice a year do we do that. Parents May hope for that, but with such an agegap, it\u2019s just not realistic most of the time", "I had mentioned it but mom and I weren't sure when she'd be able to get the time off so he decided to book without saying anything. Then he told me when he was going and assumed if it did clash I would choose his.", "Comics, board games, books, crafts\u2026 so many other things that could be done together in same room. But no, OP is supposed to be there to watch half siblings doing things", "I'm still confused on the timeline, something happened first.  If your Dad had his vacation booked before your Mom had actually booked anything, then why didn't she adjust?"]}
