Maybe your Dad should have also taught that targets of volunteerism applies only to self.", "Hi Granny Evelyn :) you're NTA we understand it is not about gay marriage or hatefulness. You run a business and your time and boundaries should be respected", "NTA, you are not obligated to agree to be \"voluntold\" to bake a free wedding cake, and if you don't want to share your recipes, you don't have to. There are millions of cake recipes on the internet.", "NTA, they are not entitled to your free services(even more so bc your sister volunteered you without your consent). It has nothing to do with homophobia. Its nice to know that you are not thought:) Btw I am just reading this whole thing with a \"grandma\" mind voice and it's so cute! \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nLet your sister be generous with her own time, talent and money.\n\nAs as for your niece calling you a name - she sounds truly awful. Why wasn't she the one to make the request - and why does she think wedding cakes are free? Lots of entitlement from the bride to be here.\n\nEditing to add - You did well with your post. Your grandson should be proud of you!", "NTA!! Your sister volunteered you without your consent. That\u2019s not cool", "NTA obviously.\n\nYou were never asked by your sister, she just volunteered your services without a discussion with you. And then feeling entitled to your recipe, when Internet is filled with recipes to all kinds of cakes is equally crazy.", "Not The A$&hole. \n\nYou have a business, it\u2019s not fair to be volunteered to do your work for free. That is very unreasonable. My aunt is a baker and I paid her in full for my wedding cake because I value her work and love to support her business. Keep your recipes, they are part of your work. \n\nThey should be excited about supporting you and your business. A wedding isn\u2019t a business, it doesn\u2019t need to be supported or paid, it\u2019s an event which they can budget for.", "NTA. There's a pervasive entitlement where people think they're allowed to demand, for free, service or goods from friends or relatives if that's the sort of hobby/profession they have. Be it crafter, baker, cook, teacher (of any sort). I used to work as a massage therapist and people would not only constantly demand/expect free massages, they'd volunteer me to others. You don't owe anyone a cake any more than I'm obligated to rub a virtual stranger's feet. The only way we end this plague of grabby hands is to say no. Good for you (and sorry she threw out \"homophobic\" as a way to gaslight you into compliance. that's appalling behavior.)", "NTA $50 for a 3 tier custom cake is an incredibly generous offer. Basically you're still doing it at a loss. If they're even unappreciative of this offer, sending them a recipe would definitely not suffice. \n\np.s. your dad is a wise man", "Nta work is never free", "NTA.

Your sister and niece are entitled. The way they insult and demean you is unacceptable, and I would no longer help them with anything. Do they have any idea how much GOOD flour, sugar, eggs, and vanilla cost these days?? I\u2019m guessing not. But", "NTA. All the false accusations of homophobia are an ridiculous manipulation. Something tells me this isn\u2019t the first time your sister has been nasty to you to get her way. The cake would still have been a tremendous gift at $50!", "NTA Wow granny I can\u2019t believe he actually got you to post and that I found it organically. \n\nalso anyone in the family siding with them saying you are homophobic is an idiot I still remember the pride cake you made when she came out, and how you kicked D out for using slurs and making stupid pansexual jokes towards me during thanksgiving. \ud83d\udc95", "A 14 year old who isn't your direct grandson convinced you to come online to strangers to ask their opinions if you're an ass at 68 years old? Oh and he told you to add a TLDR? Seems fake but I'll reply anyway.\n\nNTA. If you are running your own business then it's normal to keep your recipe. It will give you more future business. It's also normal to want to be paid to do something big. I personally would either give them the price of ingredients or even give it for free if I'm in a good position since it's my niece. But you're 100% not TA for wanting to be paid. It's your choice.", "NTA, but I think gatekeeping secret recipes is really lame.\n\nThe internet is full of recipes made by professionals whose recipes have been tested in hundreds of home kitchens and by other professionals. Anybody would be better off relying on that than granny's secret cake recipe .", "Eh, ESH\n\nNot for refusing to bake a cake for free. That shit costs money.\n\nYou're the asshole for refusing to share something as simple as a recipe. Unless you run a five star restaurant I don't see any reason to not share it. \n\nObviously the other folks involved are entitled and should have spoke with you before making any promises on your behalf.\n\nEdit: anyone responding with you know someone who refuses to share recipes, thats nice, I think they're an asshole too. Sharing things that make people happy when it comes at no expense to yourself is something good people do. Hoarding secret recipes like a dragon is just ignorant and will eventually lead to it being forgotten.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
