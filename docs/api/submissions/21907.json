Why should you do something for free, without even being asked if you would, in the first place? Entitled family members are the worst.", "NTA.   Remind your sister what you were taught about working for free.   Also, that NO ONE SPEAKS FOR YOU, YOU CAN DO THAT ALL BY YOURSELF.   Then tell her you volunteered her to clean several houses for elderly friends (or make up something) and see how she goes ballistic.   Then say see?   Same thing.     Your sister and her family are entitled and disrespectful and are using the \"h\" word as manipulation tactics.", "NTA - they are attempting to get something using bad manners.  Its their manners you object to.\n\nIts like the Israelis saying if you have a problem with Israel, you're anti Semitic.  Its attempting to confusing the issue with something that they think will cause you to back down.    I have no problem with anybody because of their ancient culture or religion or sexual orientation.  Its how they behave is the problem.\n\nYour problem wasn't with your niece but her mother, who demanded a cake for free.  That her daughter backed her up was nothing to do with sexual orientation.  Its about the cake and the recipe !", "My sis ALWAYS volunteers me for things - bane of my life. Another family memeber also. I love how they call in favours for us just because we have a particular skill. Not my sister, but the other person does it to show off. Sis just has a plain habit of landing me in predicaments. \n\nDisappointed and shocked that your sis would go round accusing you of homophobia if the same sis is close enough to you to volunteer you for making wedding cakes? That's really mean and petty. \n\nNTA as with any sense, no one works for free. If anything family should be supporting your business, not leaching off of you. WHY DO THEY DO THAT. Never understood freinds and family discount!? You are draining the f buiness and we could be making money. Why would you not want that from me. If I wanted to offer something I would. But if it's not offered don't ask. \n\nAlso if your sis is the type to say you are homophobic then she is also the type to likely share your recipe. No thoughts about you so good on you for declining to share it. There are a million recipes and google she can refer to those quite easily! \n\nAlso uninvited? Well that clears it up nicely, neice just wanted a freebie didn't get it so even if you did make it for free, now you know it wouldn't have been truly appreciated. Just another person trying to use you. \n\nYou are better off not even going to this wedding to be honest anyway because no one has respected you or treated you as family should. \n\nSo definitely NTA and I hope you don't lose a wink of sleep over it. I would bake a damn cake and post a selfie on the wedding day on your fb eating it. And make sure it's iced in white LOL ok no don't be petty I was just making a joke. \n\nMuch love \ud83d\udc95", "Your sister is the woman\u2019s nether region and your niece is entitled as hell. It would certainly be nice of you to bake it for free but even I, someone who has only ever seen baking on youtube, understands it\u2019s a ton of work. The least they could do is offer to pay you for the ingredients. NTA", "NTA and tell your sister to use this thing called google to find a wedding cake recipe if she needs one so badly.\n\n NTA  both niece and sister are huge Ah s \n\nAlso you could put on Facebook & social media the fact that your sister volontold you without asking to bake a 3tier wedding cake and both her and her daughter refused to even pay for the ingredients. This way people can find out the truth and judge for themselves knowing both sides", "NTA. You even reached out offering an explanation and a very generous discount. It sounds like your sister passed on her sense of entitlement to her daughter. Not your fault.", "NTA. \n\nWhen I was getting married we were looking at cake costs and a 3 tier cake would have cost about $1000 (thanks wedding tax) if we got a traditional white cake. We ended up getting it for half that thanks to a wonderful recommendation from a friend but still nowhere near $50. What you're asking is bargain cheap.", "Dear Granny Evelyn, \n\nYou are NTA.  Someone trying to give away your services in the first place is simply wrong, whether you're a baker or a carpenter or a musician.  Not consulting with you to simply ask if you'd like to do that for them is so very rude.\n\nStand your ground, take no shame, you've got this Granny. Recipes are important! You sound cool.", "NTA, Well done for standing up for yourself!", "NTA \n\nNo one can volunteer your time except you. \n\nP.S you gave me a fond memory of my own granny baking cakes. They were always the best! So thank you for that <3", "NTA no one should \"volunteer\" you without asking first.  And $50 for a tiered cake is a great deal.  Maybe I'm wrong, but would that even cover the ingredients?\n\nThe niece calling you a c*** (I'm assuming) would be the end of offering anything in my opinion.  Including any recipes.\n\nThis is so obviously NTA you shouldn't need Reddit.  But welcome anyway.", "NTA It's so weird that people seem to assume that anyone doing these things professionally just automatically should do things for free just because of their relationship and others volunteering other persons time without asking. Hell no, you are not wrong, they should be grateful for getting a weddingcake for $50. You did the right thing. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.  not the asshole. you got lucky.   you now know what those people are like, and do not have to socialize with them at the party.   email or text this page to anyone you like that asks you why you acted the way you did", "No, you\u2019re not the asshole. Anyone who expects to take advantage of your business for free because they\u2019re friends or family are not your friends and definitely not being good family members. They don\u2019t support you or your business endeavors. If they did, they\u2019d pay full price. A business doesn\u2019t operate in order to spend its profit margins on friends and family handing out freebies to themselves and their acquaintances in order to appear cool or connected. A real friend of family member would pay full price without question. It\u2019s up to you if you want to offer them a discount. Expecting one just because, is as dirtbag as dirtbag gets.", "Fuck that noise, Granny. We do NOT work for free and certainly not \u201cjust because we\u2019re family.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThank you for reaching out to us with your story. You are clearly in the right and your niece is just trying to use social pressure to save a few bucks. I don't think she has any idea of the valuable person she just lost, or at least hurt very deeply.", "NTA at all and your sister is committing slander over this. Frankly at this stage I'd refuse even if they offered to pay the normal price and publicly state its because of the slander while putting your position publicly since otherwise your sister controls the narrative.", "NTA\n\nYour sister had no business volunteering your work for free.\n\nShe has even less business saying it's because you are homophobic when that isn't the reason for your refusal.\n\nYour niece clearly gets her manners from her mother.", "NTA\n\nMy wife's a homebaker, some folks are just ridiculously entitled.\n\nI assist her as well, never mind a three tier cake is quite a bit of work and especially the decorating.\n\nStand strong.", "NTA - How disrespectful. It costs money and effort to make a cake, and you are supposed to sacrifice that just because you are family? That's messed up. You were even willing to make a nice discount for them. I'm sorry ma'am but you are not the asshole and them calling you homophobic is just a form of manipulation.", "Wow. You're asking 1/6 of your usual fee. That's probably the cost of ingredients AND means you're not changing for labour. \n\nYour niece is a horrible tightwad.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And yes, the Internet cares about granny drama. I'm sorry you've been treated like this by your family (minus the grandson)\n\nINFO: My question is; do you want to salvage the relationship with your sister and/or your niece or do you want to let everyone know you're not homophobic? (As it is important for your business too).", "W grandma :\u2019))\n\nNTA, and I bet your cakes are awesome", "Definitely NTA! Even if it had been a birthday cake you got signed up for, it would be a bit more reasonable, but you shouldn't be bound by someone else volunteering you.\n\n\nA 3 tier cake is just bananas!", "As a queer woman myself, no you aren't being homophobic!!!! Baking a wedding cake is expensive and time consuming, and being volunteered to do it for free is so rude! If someone did that for my (hypothetical) wedding, I would be so embarrassed and immediately offer to pay for it! \n\nPS should I ever get married, grandma evelyn can you please make my cake? I'll pay whatever.", "NTA! Give her the \"recipe\", just omit the levening agent. Or something. My grandma used to do this with people that wouldn't take no for an answer. I found out that the hard way. She had no issues with giving me recipes, but was so used to being hounded for them that she just automatically did it... The time I got her chocolate sugar cookies and there was no cocoa powder, I called her up when I went to make them. It was pretty funny. It drove my dad nuts, but as he got older he started to do the same. When she passed away, I got all of her recipes, my dad must have spent a week copying them all.", "You weren\u2019t the AH and you are even less of an AH when I consider that you were voluntold, and then they double-down with slander. Very much NTA. But there is a silver-lining- no need to spend money on the gift or the outfit for such an entitled person. I hope her fianc\u00e9e knows what\u2019s she\u2019s getting into.", "NTA \n\nDo\u00f1a, you're not in the wrong. Awful people ur sister and niece smearing you with something as terrible as calling u homophobic", "NTA, this isn\u2019t about homophobia. On top of that you offered an insanely generous discount and it sounds like you were doing so partially for the principle.\nIf this were me, if they come back and say \u201cNevermind we want this $300 cake for $50, is still refuse.\n\nThis is petty on their part. Definitely NTA.", "Absolutely NTA! You are not in the wrong AT ALL.", "NTA\n\nBut you might need to respond publicly to the claim on FB as that rumor could ruin your business.", "Wow I\u2019m so sorry they treated you this way, definitely NTA", "Ok so you offered to do it for ~17% the actual price and *THEY STILL WANT IT FREE OF CHARGE?* NTA", "First: Welcome to reddit! :D\n\nSecond:  You're NTA (not the asshole). If they had asked nicely I'm sure it would have been no problem, but to exploit your business and just expect your time and stuff for free is just rude and entiteled. You are right to put them I their place.", "INFO: I don't understand the part about the recipe. Wedding cakes can be made using any type of flavour. Is there something unique about your secret recipe?  \n\nIt seems like with the Internet you can find a recipe for just about anything.

Wow...\n\nYou DEFINITELY had no reason to make a cake for FREE, nor give up your recipe! The sheer audacity of them to say you'd make a cake WITHOUT asking you has me flabbergasted!", "NTA\nRegardless if its a hobby of yours or a business, you not obligated to do something for free. My fiance bakes as a hobby, usually for family and friends and bake sales at schools etc, and usually she will either for free or charges them just for the costs of ingredients and decorations (no labour, storage costs, profit) but she has said no a number of times as well when she's been busy because its very time consuming! People forget the labour that goes into making a cake, she takes whole working day to make a standard layered cake, let alone a 3 tier wedding cake!! For FREE! The discount price you offered was extremely reasonable btw because they will get charged alot more going to a specialist cake maker. Its disgusting to that your sister thought that is acceptable to offer that and then ask for your own recipe (tell her to get a cook book, they are less than $10 plus there is free recipes online) and then your niece to act like a child, take away your invite and then try to exile from the family by saying your homophobic. Honestly, this show little respect towards and you deserve better than them in your life and bless your grandson for helping you out,hes good one. Take care.", "NTA so if you tell a neighbour niece would be delighted to come clean neighbour's house for free next month, that would be fine? They volunteered your labor and time, as well as the entire cost for the cake - ingredients - and not a thought to you and your wallet. Tell them they get what they paid for, which in this case is nothing.", "Maybe Esh. \u00a350 discount is all you\u2019ll give your family on a WEDDING? \nThey also sound a bit entitled though so probably esh.", "OP, it would be so funny if you made a miniature version of a 3-tier wedding cake.
