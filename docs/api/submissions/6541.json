Good for you for standing up for Aiden. He deserves to have his own life and should not be forced to be his brother\u2019s caretaker for the rest of his life. Your husband, on the other hand, acted horribly. The fact that he did what he did without telling anyone says he knows what he did was wrong - he just didn\u2019t want to be caught. He made the offer to Aiden and was turned down. That should have ended it. Instead, he lied and did illegal things to manipulate your son to do what he wanted.

Husband is clearly a self centered manipulator who is harming everyone in the family.   His justification for his behavior pits the two sons against each other instead of what he claims as working together as a family.  Aiden can no longer trust dad to be fair and will need to make every effort to isolate dad from his life. Here's hoping that you can work all of this out, protecting yourself, Aiden, and younger son from the misguided interference of husband.  Best wishes.", "NTA. A 23 year old cannot exist on \u2018allowance\u2019 and he\u2019s not a defacto caretaker. Your husband seems unhinged.\n\nYou did the right thing for your son.", "NTA Aiden has a college degree, he worked hard for that so I totally understand that he wants to use it. Your husband is being very unreasonable. I understand that he wants to make sure his son is cared for but that is not Aidens job. Besides it would be a real waste of money to send Aiden to college and not let him do anything with the degree, you are not the asshole in my opinion. I would recommend thinking about if this marriage is healthy for you OP because your husband seems toxic\u2026", "My husband would be my ex husband if he did this. You are a great parent. I can\u2019t write what your husband is without getting banned. NTA.", "NTA and what your husband is doing is criminal (at least figuratively, but likely literally as well).  This is seriously sociopathic behavior - dig into this (on behalf of both sons and yourself) to see what else he's been doing, because impersonating one person to force his way likely doesn't stop there.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are a great parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur husband is an abusive AH. Get a divorce.", "NTA - this is malicious sabotage of another person\u2019s wellbeing\u2026that\u2019s abuse.

Your husband could get charged with identity theft, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s your family or a stranger, you are not allowed to do what he has done.", "Nta. You did so right by your son and you are a good mother. I don't understand why only aiden can be his brothers caregiver according to your husband but this is not aidens responsibility. His is to live his life and actually have one and your husbands is to find care for his son without ruining his others sons life. What you husband did wqs just wrong and his outlook is wrong too.", "Your husband is a horrible, emotionally abusive, manipulating, insensitive, shit excuse for a father and husband. I think you all need to get away from him. NTA", "Good intentions do not make lying and placing one son over another ok. He risked making Aiden resent his brother by making him the situation he failed to get out of because he could not get a job.", "NTA.\n\nDa fuq wing with your husband?\n\nGetting started as a young worker is crucial. He could stunt your son's entire life path with this bullshit. Long-term caregiving is no joke, and can cause major depression, but this is screamingly, strongly not the way to deal with the original he clearly is either having or worried about having with your other child.", "NTA\n\nWhat your husband did to Aiden is inexcusable. Just how does he expect Aiden to take care of his brother down the line if he's never had a career or any savings?", "NTA the fact that your husband went to these great lengths should show you how his brain operates OP. He\u2019s not a trustworthy person.", "NTA. But you also need to move out. Your husband is crazy.", "NTA\nI'm usually not a \"get rid of him\" kind of person, but I think your husband should be looking for an apartment, instead of your son.  Your husband's actions are incredibly selfish and underhanded. I would not want to live under the same roof as him.", "You know someone's fucked up when they're the ones actively sabotaging somebody else, the audacity to call anyone but themselves unhinged is astonishing", "NTA\n\nI wonder if your husband's actions count as fraud where you live.  Either way, they are just unbelievably awful.", "I hope you move into that rental with your son after handing your husband divorce papers, OP, because that is selfishness to a level I never thought I\u2019d see. NTA in the slightest", "NTA your husband is crazy", "NTA. The lengths to which your husband is willing to go to control another person's life is deranged.

You're protecting your son from an abuser, not teaching him to be selfish.", "NTA\n\nWell done mama bear. You don't always need to roar, all you have to do is ACT.", "NTA ,your husband is the crazy,unhinged one. Tell him to get help pls", "NTA - but wtf.  Your husband is deranged and you should leave him. Your older son has a degree, wants to work and be independent and your husband is gaslighting him to try to keep him around to support his younger disabled brother?

All the Dad is doing is causing resentment betwem aiden, himself and younger bro.\nBoth deserve to have independent lives separate from each other.  \nAll Dad is doing is teaching  Aiden  is to hate his little brother.", "NTA.  You are not a terrible mother but your husband is an absolutely terrible father.  Why does he hate Aiden so much?  He is literally trying to throw away one son\u2019s entire life in favour of another son.  That is the type of man you divorce not stay with.", "NTA.  \n\nYour husband is solidifying that your younger son is not going to be cared for by his older brother by doing all of this.\n\n\nHas there ever been a discussion with Aiden about what he wants in the future or has it just been assumed that he will care for younger brother?\n\nYou did good by Aiden here though.  He needs experience in the real world working and not just taking care of someone.  Your husband is robbing him of his time to grow as a young adult.\n\nAnd as others have pointed out, it is criminal what he's doing to your son.", "NTA. Best case your husband is burned out and saw using aiden as a way to take off some of his stress. More likely he's looking to set Aiden up as a permanent carer, ruin his life and chain him down all because of choices your husband made.\n\nAsk him why one child's life is more important than the other.", "NTA. Your husband is deliberately sabotaging Aidens life to become his brothers caregiver so that HE doesn't have to do anything. This is a foul and reprehensible thing to do. He'll soon be wondering why he doesn't contact him.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is a huge AH and absolutely toxic. He exploits Aiden as a caretaker and deliberately ruins his own future and opportunities.\n\nThe only one who is selfish and irresponsible is your husband, and clearly NOT Aiden.\n\nDo whatever you need to do in order to protect your son and don\u2018t let your husband exploit and parentify him further.", "You husband has nerve to say A is selfish? Hubby is AH. Also, tell Aiden he needs to set up a new email of your husband has the password for his email. He may have enough control of that account to be able to get past a password change.", "NTA. It's horrible that your husband thinks it's Aiden's responsibility entirely to care for your other son & feels absolutely no shame in crippling Aiden's life to ensure that fact. Your husband is breeding terrible resentment with his authoritarian behavior, & there's no way that wouldn't be taken out on your younger son if/when Aiden was forced to become a full time caregiver instead of pursuing his own life.", "NTA but what you should have done was found a place for the three of you and left that abusive, manipulative, controlling asshole of a husband of yours.", "NTA.\n\nThis is parentification and a form of child abuse. Aiden's brother is not his responsibility.", "Nta. Your husband is crazy. Your son is an adult. He needs to be able start his own life.", "NTA- like a loving parent you are doing the best for Aiden to launch him into adulthood. While having a special needs child is stressful especially as they get older, it sounds like you recognize being dependent on Aiden is not a long term plan.", "NTA he's a terrible father himself ,who does something like that to their own child... talking about selfish and controlling!", "NTA and your husband needs to give his head a wobble.", "Info, if you have the money for a an allowance and an apartment, why can't you hire extra help.\n\nIdk this rings weird.", "NTA \nYour husband is crazy. It\u2019s not Aiden\u2019s responsibility to care for his disabled brother at the at the expense of his own life. You and your husband need to look into long-term care options for your disabled son. \n\nIn the meantime thank you so much for being a caring, concerned mother and looking out for Aiden\u2019s best interests", "NTA, \n\nIt does suck that you need to take such a route to give your oldest son a safe spot to start to establish himself but you're not the AH here\n\nYour husband certainly is an AH though. It isn't your oldest son's job to stay home and care for his younger brother for the rest of his life. Forcing him into that role will only make him resent both your husband and his younger brother. \n\nGood on you for giving him a way out", "Nta. Aiden needs to make his own life without having to be a lowly paid caretaker against his will", "NTA. But your husband is. \nWhat you did with Aiden is salvage your future relationship with him. If it goes your husband\u2019s way, no one should be surprised when Aiden goes no-contact. His brother is not his responsibility, he did no conceive him. Aiden has no duty to set his own life aside to care for his brother. \nIf I had a dad actively sabotaging my life as a teen, he would be out of my life indefinitely.", "NTA. I mean what your husband did will have completely destroyed any trust and not just pushed past some boundaries he's destroyed them. I don't know how you come back from something like that.\nAlso this has to be the first parent ever who doesn't want their offspring to actually go out and get a job.\n\nWell done on getting your son out of there. I would seriously question your husband as to why he thought committing fraud was appropriate behaviour.", "NtA. You are an excellent mom for seeing the issue, a solution to that issue, while still helping aiden get on his feet without being sabatoged by dad. Well done!   Yes the backlash sucks but i hope it is appreciated by your son.", "NTA but your husband is a huge one. Please help hire a home health aid", "NTA\n\nYour son is his own person and is not a free caregiver to anyone but himself. It is very unfair of your husband to deny him his chance of living his life just because he wants free help. I think you are being a good mom to support your son now when he needs you. Make sure he changes passwords and such.", "NTA. Aiden deserves to have a life of his own. You and your husband need to find a better plan to take care of your youngest. What if Aiden meets somebody and wants to start his independent life, what next? Your husband will contact his SO to ruin relationship?", "NTA but your husband is.\n\n\nAiden is a young man and he needs to experience life for himself. You're doing the right thing and thank you for having his back. Aiden will thank you later.\n\nAiden is not a caregiver, parent or therapist - he's a brother and a son. Your husband is abusing him and taking advantage of him.", "Dobby the House Elf. \ud83e\udd23 I just watched the movie where he gets gifted the sock last night!-- the apartment is essentially the sock!", "I never thought I would read about a person like OP's husband.", "Seconded. How if he going to blow up at OP for \u201cgoing behind\u201d their backs when he did that to ruin his son\u2019s future for his own selfish reasons? Op is the only one looking out for the kids. Aiden isn\u2019t responsible to care for his younger brother the way his parents are. I\u2019m sure he would want to be there some times, they\u2019re brothers, they have that bond. Sounds like \u201cdad\u201d doesn\u2019t want to be dad and take whole responsibility. What father goes around calling places to ruin his son\u2019s future and then has the nerve to get mad when its found out & you help your son leave to get away from the abuse? It all sounds very toxic, I\u2019m sorry OP.", "No, Aiden shouldn\u2019t take care of his brother at any point. He should have his own life. His parents are the ones who must plan and provide for the brother for when they\u2019re gone.", "The husband wants free help. Proper professional help is expensive as hell, but don't worry, they have good big brother who will do it for free because he's *family* /s\n\nOP is NTA but I'd heavily recommend some form of counseling to figure out why your husband wants to drag your son down and stop him from having his own life.", "The weirdest thing about this is that the OP's husband has apparently been sneaking into his son's email to cancel the job applications for over a year and in all that time, not a single potential employer has ever emailed back to say \"thanks for letting us know\" or anything like that.", "In the long run, even if the brother was going to take some responsibility for his disabled brother, it would be better to maximize his earning potential to give him the resources to do it. What else is the long game here after you both are no longer able to provide for them both? Him taking care of his brother in a cardboard box under a bridge? Your husband stealing your sons identity to interfere in his livelihood makes no sense on any level."]}
