Tell me, when you and he pass, how will Aiden get a job and support himself (and your younger son, since that is your husband's master plan) when he will have had no job experience?

Your actions will cause Aiden to hate you, because you've made plans for his entire life without consulting him and have been destroying his chances to fulfill his dreams. He will resent your younger son, because he's the anchor you've tied him to; it's one thing to look after a sick or disabled relative because you choose to, but to be forced to only breeds resentment. And he will potentially resent your wife if he sides with her. You are tearing the family apart, and if you ask her to choose between her son having his freedom and allowing you to financially control and abuse him, you may well destroy your marriage; a good mother will always, always protect her cub when they are being hurt, and that is what your wife is doing. \n\nGo find outside help.

Depending on needs (and area), there are also peds (and adult as he ages) day programs for profoundly disabled kids- these give the kids a change of scenery and the parents a break.

If my grandma would end needing help 24/7 we were ready to put her in a nursing home, for her sake.

Parenting done right!", "He thinks of Aiden as his possession to control. My abusive father would do this to my younger brother who worked on the farm - didn't pay him at all (my mother secretly gave him money) but would ring and cancel every outside job my brother was offered, saying he was needed at home. It was abuse pure and simple.", "So true, that he didn't even ask Aiden. He just forced him to do as he wished!", "Our second daughter was born with lifelong disabilities.  \n\nThere was some training we \"pushed\" onto anyone commonly in our home such as turning up oxygen if she was in distress.  The next step to these things was always \"and get mom or dad.\"  \n\nThere was a lot of other training we gave our oldest, mostly to protect them both from her curiosity about feeding tubes and breathing tubes and such.  Most of that training was letting her play with a doll with the same equipment.  Big sister really enjoyed feeding little sister, so we let them.\n\nMy oldest *wanted* to grow up taking care of her sister.  It hurts her that she can't do that since her little sister passed in 2016.  And even then, I never could make plans for her future caring for her sister.   We worked hard to make sure our oldest lived her own life with her own dreams and goals.\n\nWhat Aiden's father is doing is completely messed up.  I say this having walked a mile in his shoes, collapsed in exhaustion, cried out drowning in the weight of everything.", "This. The statistics for disabled people harmed by their caregivers are appalling and a huge part of that is because we don't recognize (or allow acknowledgement of) what a huge strain it can be.\n\nPeople just soldier on in silence as best they can and every once in awhile, they snap.", "Just to be clear, we aren't the problem, accessibility to the accommodations we may need to help us function is the problem. Disabled individuals themselves are not the problem.", "Frequent in house caretaking costs a lot more than renting some tiny 1-1.5 room apartment.", "THIS!", "In the gap section he can fill in the months as personal caregiver and list responsibilities. It may help with the gap.", "Honestly OP should probably prepare for Aiden cutting off contact with both of them. I can\u2019t speak from personal experience but when one parent is abusive I know it\u2019s pretty common for the child to hold a grudge against the non-abusive parent for not doing enough to stop it.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not saying OP is necessarily at fault but she has made a few excuses downplaying her husband actions and doesn\u2019t seem to have much agency in her own house. Obviously the husband is ultimate asshole and OP is a victim as well.", "It\u2019s also messed up that the husband would say caring for the son is his own responsibility, yet he\u2019s clearly pawned it off on Aiden", "Seriously. Unless she's in physical danger I have no idea why she's *allowing* her husband to behave like this toward *her* children. This reeks of \"he's nice when he's not drunk\" energy.", "A new bank account at a completely different bank and don\u2019t leave checks laying around.

My elder brother was treated so differently than me. As a kid, i never realized how harsh they were with him but growing up I can see the emotional damage they did on him. I am doing pretty good in my life but my brother is still struggling to get his life together. I support him as much as I can from my end.", "Sounds as though the husband may be the type who would reject anything that looks like a \u201cgovernment handout\u201d and would rather enslave the other son.\n\nIts now the OP\u2019s responsibility to force this issue to a head, and line up any and all resources available.", "Needing care is a problem.

Took me eight years, but I graduated with my bachelor's (with honors!). I was able to drag my son and I out of poverty immediately after graduation. But the best part is exactly what you mentioned, I'm not desperate to be hired. I know my worth and qualifications and can negotiate for a good salary and job. I encourage you to look into college or at least trade school. My son is doing the trade school route and loves it. You'll be surprised, it's not too hard to go back as an \"old timer\". It's really worth it too. Good luck to you! I'm sorry your parents were shit.", "Oof. This point hits hard. His eldest is a caregiver, his youngest is a problem, hell, he might even see OP as an extension of himself.", "Why would they even have checks to leave around? I haven't had checks in 10+ years, haha. Paystubs are all digital, payments are all digital, rent is paid online...

I smell gaslighting.\n\nOP is the hero here.", "Right? Like a Munchausen's by proxy situation, but with a different motivation.", "Your so right! Mom is clearly in denial. She's asking for advice for what? You see she keeps making excuses for him. They have been together trying to make Aiden a slave. I'll bet all my lunch money on it. And if you spoke with those so called family members. I bet it would be something totally different. It's more to this than is being said. When you don't agree with her. She makes up another story. Look out people. For the next eight million.", "NTA\n\nEverything he said to you describes and applies to him perfect. HE is unhinged.
