I brought my large meal with me and set up on a very gorgeous area with a great view of the lake.

He gets annoyed and just asks again but I tell him now. A few minutes later the photographer returns with the guy who was going to propose. The guy proposing asks me this time and I just tell him no, that he can wait. He asks me wtf is wrong with me and I just tell him that I am eating my meal. He starts telling at me to gtfo but I put on my headphones and just continue eating. After a while he leaves me alone.\n\nAfter I felt satisfied from the meal I packed up and was heading down. The three were waiting at another spot and the men point me out and the lady starts yelling at me that I ruined her day and that the proposal happened elsewhere instead of the spot I was in.
