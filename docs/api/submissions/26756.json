One evening I was at one of the little vista \u201cpiers\u201d and a foursome appeared with one guy in a suit and a woman in a lovely dress along with a casually dressed guy and gal. I quickly got out of their way and watched a 3 minute wedding ceremony! \n\nAfterwards they were taking photos of each other with their cell phones so I volunteered to take group photos.

Think how this would play if the couple wanted to do a gender reveal photo shoot instead of a proposal photo shoot.  Man, reddit would want fetus blood if the couple wanted to cut short OP's succulent one-hour meal for that.  So it had to be something with it's own base of support.
