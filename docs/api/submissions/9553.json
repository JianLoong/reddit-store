Even though I didn't reply, I read most of the replies, good or bad. And I am thankful for all of you who encouraged me to give my daughter a second chance.\n\nI'll summarise it: I went back to Miami and she gave me a heartfelt apology and explained all the dark things her boyfriend was getting her into. We got into therapy once again, she left her abusive relationship and these past three years our relationship has become better than ever! It was not easy, but definitely worth it. I'm glad I didn't give up.\n\nThanks reddit!", "created_utc": 1675959630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xysdc/update_aita_for_not_forgiving_my_daughter/", "score": 59, "replies": ["[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dk44hh/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_daughter/)", "A wholesome update?
