Even though I didn't reply, I read most of the replies, good or bad. And I am thankful for all of you who encouraged me to give my daughter a second chance.\n\nI'll summarise it: I went back to Miami and she gave me a heartfelt apology and explained all the dark things her boyfriend was getting her into. We got into therapy once again, she left her abusive relationship and these past three years our relationship has become better than ever! It was not easy, but definitely worth it. I'm glad I didn't give up.\n\nThanks reddit!", "created_utc": 1675959630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xysdc/update_aita_for_not_forgiving_my_daughter/", "score": 2016, "replies": ["[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dk44hh/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_daughter/)", "A wholesome update?

It is scary how easy it is to slide down that slippery slope. You're a normal teenager. You make the wrong friend or get the wrong boy or girl friend. Then there's drugs and alcohol. Maybe physical and/or mental abuse and before you can even look around you're at the bottom of a well looking up at the light you fell from. If you are very fortunate you have someone to reach down to try and pull you back up but you need to make the decision to take that hand because no one's arm is long enough and strong enough to pull someone out of that well all by themselves.", "I still think about the young pregnant lady whose fianc\u00e9 told her abusive mother where to find them, and invited her to come visit.
