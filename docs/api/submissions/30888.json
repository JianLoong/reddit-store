John and Ava spoke briefly, it was a little awkward but everyone was civil.\n\nAbout half was into the evening, I left with my husband to go and grab everyone some more drinks, we came back to find the table in chaos.  Ava and John were both yelling at eachother and hurling insults. I asked what happened and my other BIL explained that they'd started arguing about politics again. Ava and John both said that wasn't true and Ava said that John was being a \"sexist pig\". \n\nJust to clarify he hadn't actually said anything sexist about her, he had just made a political comment she disagreed with.\n\nI said I didn't care if he was sexist, all I cared about was having a normal dinner without them arguing. I told them that they could either shut up and keep their opinions to themselves or they could leave. Ava left and John stayed for the rest of an awkward dinner.

So OP the only thing she cares about is to have her wonderful family reunion and she is going to allow her BIL to say whatever he wants, even if it is disgusting, only to have her way. She is not justified to being mad if the comment the BIL made was indeed sexist and unfair, because the sister doesn't have to endure everything only for her sister to have a \"quiet dinner\", and she shouldn't have said that she doesn't care if it was sexist, as it put them both at the same level.
