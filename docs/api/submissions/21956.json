My wife gave birth to twins 3 weeks ago via emergency c section and a little over a week ago we finally got home from the NICU. I think in my exhaustion I forgot to mention it to her; but my parents decided they wanted to visit our first week home and I worked out all the details with them. \n\nThis was when the crying started. My wife has always had a great relationship with my parents so I thought she\u2019d be happy to see them but she was really upset when they showed up. I know from reading the questionnaires that not finding happiness in things that previously made you happy is a sign of PPD. I  know she\u2019s ok with visitors right now because her mom is here helping.\n\nThe twins are a lot of work so my wife has been pumping every 2 hours to allow us both to bottle feed. She said it\u2019s because she\u2019s having trouble with the babies nursing but I think it\u2019s just so she doesn\u2019t have to get up to feed them at night and can have me do it. I\u2019ve been struggling to wake up and stay awake to take care of them for my 6 hour night block but I\u2019ve been pretty good. My wife has only had to wake up during my shift a handful of times when I was sleeping which I feel like is way better than most guys. And on top of it when my wife is awake her mom helps her so really it\u2019s harder for me.\n\nMy sleep deprivation has gotten unbearably  mentally to the point where I need a mental reset to be a good dad and partner. My parents wanted to do some exploring in the area anyway so each day they were here I would spend time with them trying to be a good host. Bike rides and hikes with my dad and shopping trips with my mom during the day. I\u2019m only out of the house for maybe 5-6 hours max each day and help with the babies when I get home. \n\nA few days into my parents stay my wife said she no longer loves me and resents me for not caring about her or our kids and leaving during the day/\u201ctreating my PPL like a vacation\u201d. She also said that she wanted my parents out in a really rude way right in front of them. I was really embarrassed for her because they were nice enough to buy us all dinner multiple times when she didn\u2019t feel up to cooking. I told my parents to excuse her behavior but that she had postpartum depression so we shouldn\u2019t hold it against her. She packed up the babies and herself in the car and drove with her mom to her parent\u2019s house. I\u2019m doing everything I can to contact her doctor about her PPD because I\u2019m really worried about her and love her so much. I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH here for mentally resetting so I could better support my family and trying to get my wife the help she needs. Am I really the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I really didn\u2019t see how in the wrong I was. Thanks for setting me straight hopefully before it was too late. I talked to my wife and apologized profusely. She is refusing to come back home until I have cleaned the entire house spotless, taken care of all the laundry, and have a freezer full of freezer meals prepared for her return. I guess this is a small price to pay for what I realize now is how badly I fucked up\u2026", "created_utc": 1689088399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wu1x3/aita_for_telling_my_parents_my_wife_has/", "score": 3775, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you're treating your wife's situation like she's an idiot, not a sleep-deprived person recovering from a major medical procedure and trying to make it work. A few tips:\n\n1. No guests without notice AND consent ever again.\n2. No minimizing the work of pumping\n3. Stay awake or easily wake-able by the babies during your shift. \n4. Do not minimize the pain or time needed to heal from birthing.\n5. Do not diagnose your wife with anything unless you're her doctor -- and if you are, get her a different doctor.\n6. Show compassion if you think she's struggling. Don't insult her.\n7. Do not leave her for 6 hours at a time during the day to entertain your parents. The babies are the \"entertainment\" right now.\n8. If you genuinely think she needs help with PPD, talk to HER not your parents or her doctor.\n\nI could go on, but that's a start toward being less of an ass.", "YTA. YTA. YTA.\n\n>My parents wanted to do some exploring in the area anyway so each day they were here I would spend time with them **trying to be a good host**. Bike rides and hikes with my dad and shopping trips with my mom during the day. I\u2019m only out of the house for maybe 5-6 hours max each day and help with the babies when I get home. \n\nYou're not their *host*. You're the neglectful AH father of newborn twins.\n\nHow TF do you justify spending 5-6 hours going shopping and hiking with your parents while your wife is at home with the babies? Are you living in some fantasy land? You're lucky she didn't change the locks and throw your belongings onto the pavement - I would have. Send your parents home (they're also AHs btw) and then grovel for forgiveness.", "LMAO you \u201cforgot\u201d to tell your wife that your parents would be invading her PP time, she\u2019s upset, and you\u2019re attributing to PPD. Not to mention all the other crap where you expect a pat on the back for doing the bare minimum. YTA.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on \u201cso really it\u2019s harder for me\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s recovering from a twin pregnancy and major surgery.", "YTA. \n\nDude what the hell. If your parents decided to come visit after the birth of your twins, they should be there to HELP. Make meals, clean, get groceries, watch the babies. Not have you tour them around the city and treat it as a vacation. The first couple months should be all about the babies and supporting your wife. She just went through a major surgery and TWINS. She doesn't have PPD, she's dealing with a husband who is not supporting her. I would be sobbing and not wanting to be around him either.", "YTA, where to start???\n\nanyone else notice though how he mentions \u201cwhen she doesn\u2019t feel like cooking\u201d \u2014 basically outing himself for not doing that either lmao\n\nThank god it sounds like she has a brain and is leaving you. Let the poor woman go instead of making her care for triplets.", "YTA a massive one. I wouldn't be surprised if your marriage is never the same after this. That's if she can even forgive your selfish, abhorrent attitude after giving birth TO YOUR children. Vile individual.", "YTA.  Why did you arrange for your parents to come without discussing it with your wife?  I doesn't matter that she always liked them.  Would you want people around after having major surgery and massive sleep deprivation?  Of course, having them there means you had to spend time with them when you should have been spending with your wife and children.  The fact that you did this is mind boggling.  Basically, you were saying that your parents were more important than your wife.  Here's an idea: how about your wife leaves for 5-6 hours every day while you stay home with the twins?  Sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it?  Plus, during those 5-6 hours, you get to mentally reset.  When does your wife get to reset?  And suddenly, despite your lack of knowledge, you decided to diagnose your wife with PPD.  I don't know if she has it or not, but if she does, your message should be that this is not her fault, that she didn't do anything to cause it, and there is help available for her to get better.  All in all, you owe your wife a huge apology for your behavior.", "Bro YTA, big time! Starting with inviting your parents to visit without your wife's knowledge or consent....right after birthing twins and major surgery. On through \"hosting\" your parents on fun activities while she is stuck at home to care for the twins. They should be home with her helping, not out and about seeing the sights.  And then to crown it all you--a non-doctor--\"diagnose\" her with PPD and share this info with your parents. Oh and you whine about your sleep deprivation...how do you think your wife is doing in that department?  Self centered doesn't even begin to cover it. I wouldn't blame her if the next thing you hear from her has comes from an lawyer.", "YTA. Being a good host to your parents during this visit was so far down the list of essential things that you should not even have considered it. 5 or 6 hours per day????? You need to get your head checked, asshole doesn't come close to covering it.", "YTA it\u2019s hard to believe this is real because of how badly you are fumbling this. You seem to be a clueless know it all who has no sympathy for what your wife has and is still going through. It\u2019s no wonder she is fed up with you.", "YTA - Your parents can go entertain themselves somewhere, if they can't they need to go back home. Your wife needs help and lots of support. You have twins, obviously shes not just going to snap back to her old self right away. She will get better if she has support to learn all the new stuff that comes with babies, you are not supporting her by abandoning her and your twins to go off to be with 2 very grown adults.", "Oh, on a birth board I used to frequent, we would ask new moms if they thought they had PPD or if they were just surrounded by assholes.  Guess which way your wife would probably answer?", "\u201cI know from reading the questionnaires that not finding happiness in things that previously made you happy is a sign of PPD. I know she\u2019s ok with visitors right now because her mom is here helping.\u201d\n\nHas your wife actually been formally diagnosed with PPD? If not, I would avoid sharing a diagnosis like that. \n\nI would see there being a difference between her mom being present to help and visiting relatives too. She might simply be comfortable with her mom lending a hand right now while she recovers, an emergency caesarean is a big thing. \n\n\u201cShe said it\u2019s because she\u2019s having trouble with the babies nursing but I think it\u2019s just so she doesn\u2019t have to get up to feed them at night and can have me do it.\u201d\n\nPumping so often isn\u2019t an easy task or a shortcut. Your wife is recovering from a *major emergency surgery* and probably needs as much rest as possible right now. I think your comment of, \u201cI feel like is way better than most guys,\u201d is a little out of place. \n\n\u201cMy sleep deprivation has gotten unbearable mentally to the point where I need a mental reset to be a good dad and partner\u2026I\u2019m only out of the house for maybe 5 - 6 max each day and help with the babies when I get home.\u201d\n\nOP, your wife is three weeks out of emergency surgery and probably needs you to be present right now. I can\u2019t ever give birth naturally and the mere thought of my husband doing that is pretty horrifying. \n\nYour wife will be experiencing a lot of extreme emotions right now and you going out for 5 - 6 hours a day really isn\u2019t the way to handle a situation where someone is recovering from surgery with two newborns. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can to contact her doctor about her PPD because I\u2019m really worried about her and love her so much.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t diagnose your wife, you\u2019re not her doctor. I can understand why your wife is so upset. Don\u2019t go around your wife to speak to her doctor without her consent, and don\u2019t act like her response to your choices is just a result of PPD when her response is actually really understandable. \n\nI would lean towards YTA because you don\u2019t seem to even be aware of some of your behaviour here.", "YTA and a huge one. This can't be real. You are an awful husband and father if this post is real. Your poor wife.", "YOUR WIFE HAD AN EMERGENCY C SECTION AND IT'S HARDER FOR YOU? YOU'RE OFF SITE SEEING WITH YOUR FREELOADING PARENTS! YTA YTA YTA", "YTA.  Your wife's entire mind and body is resetting and you're out fucking around with your parents all day because you're a little sleep deprived?  You sound like you're more concerned about being a good son than a good husband and father.  You better fix that quick before your wife removes you from the husband role.", "YTA - My man, you ROYALLY fucked up.  I am aghast at this.  Where to even start? You aren't a doctor, you cannot make a diagnosis of anything.  Just because she is sick and overwhelmed and injured and sore and hormonal doesn't mean she has PPD or that her reaction isn't completely and utterly justified.  \n\nHer mother is there to take care of HER. Do you understand that your wife just went through a traumatic medical event? Would you force your wife to host your family if she had just been released from the hospital after something like heart surgery? \n\nApologize to your wife. Tell your parents you were wrong.  Ask them to leave. And never do this again.", "My dude, the thing you should be \u201creally worried about\u201d is that you\u2019re about to be handed divorce papers. You have not been a supportive partner, you continue to minimize (and simultaneously pathologize) what your wife has been going through, and you seem to want a gold star for minimal effort. You need to do some deep reflection and sincerely apologize for the ways you have failed your wife but so far based on your comments I see zero self awareness. YTA.", "YTA. \u201cSo really its harder for me\u201d\n\n\nOh my. I just cannot. A woman\u2019s body does bot go back to normal after giving birth! There\u2019s postpartum pain from healing from the birth (if a caesarean surgery, its major surgery and recovery takes months). The uterus contracts after birth until it gets back to its pre-pregnancy size. That hurts. Breasfeeding and pumping every two hours not just hurts, but is physically tiring. Your body actually burns more calories to produce more milk. You have twins, thats twice the workload for any parent. \n\nYou should have been by her side and not going out taking hikes with your parents or whatever. You do not get to say its harder on you. That\u2019s parenthood. Its hard. You calling her doctor about her ppd is not helping because it sounds like the blame is all on her and youre just the tired but loving dad and husband?!?\n\nYou do not sound like you are \u201cworried and love her so much\u201d because if you did, then you would have made her the number 1 priority during this time. The woman put one foot in the grave to give you children. Her body is recovering from a major change and its not just the ppd, you need to understand that and let her take the lead.\n\nSleep deprivation is the least of your problems. It looks like its the least of your wife\u2019s, too. Its kind of sounding like you do not like all the bad stuff that comes with taking care of newborns and now you are trying to pin it on your wife.\n\n\nETA: Also what is up with your parents going there being a burden and not helping out? They should be cooking meals if you or your wife are too tired to cook. If they cannot contribute they should at least not be in the way of you being with your family who needs you. They bought meals for you? They can do that from their home instead of making a vacation out of this. You guys are so out of touch with reality I just cannot.", "You're so exhausted that you have to go hiking and out touring with your family 6 hours everyday? Omg really? You have it harder than your wife who just had major surgery and is caring for twins? You think her pumping every 2 hours is her being lazy and not wanting to get up in the night and not a way to increase milk supply to provide for her babies? You're outrageous and I hope she has a good time at her parents house getting a mental reset from you. YTA entirely.", "YTA. How can you actually write this out and still question whether you're the AH or not?\n\nYour focus should be on your wife and children; not whining about how exhausted you are or playing host to your parents, whose visit you conveniently forget to tell her about until after you got home from the hospital \n\nWhat you should have told your parents is the truth. That right now, you're a crappy father and husband. That you conveniently forgot to tell your wife about their visit until after you got home from the hospital and that instead of playing tour guide, you need to spend all your energies supporting your wife and children. \n\nYou're tired. Boo-freaking-hoo. She just spent 9+ months growing, not one, but two humans, had an emergency C-section then a stay in the NICU, and now she has to spend her recover time with a spouse who doesn't support her. \n\nEither learn to put your wife and children first, or be ready for this marriage to go down the tubes. When it does, you'll have no one but yourself to blame.", "Holy shit YTA.\n\nHere are your priorities for the next however long:\n\n1. Take care of YOUR WIFE, who JUST had MAJOR surgery, is newly postpartum, is nursing and pumping for TWINS, and dealt with houseguests -- NOT HELPERS, like her mom, but HOUSEGUESTS she apparently cooked for at least some of the time -- and a bonehead for a husband who needs a \"mental reset.\"\n\n2. Literally nothing else until #1 is completed.\n\nDo better.", "YTA. Leaving for 5 or 6 hours a day when she has 3-week old twins is bad. Inviting your parents without telling her is bad. Expecting someone who just had twins by C-section to do the cooking is bad. You are in a big hole and keep digging. Stop. Send the parents home. Apologize to your wife. Your life just underwent a massive change that is going to last at least 18 years. Time to adjust to that new reality.", "YTA.....she's not diagnosed with postpartum depression and you shouldn't be telling others she has it without a diagnosis.  She's pissed because you're being a shit partner.  Her mother is there to take care of her! Oh and why in the hell is she cooking?  You can't cook?", "YTA and prepare for those divorce papers.", "YTA for allowing your parents to visit YOUR FIRST WEEK HOME after what was probably a traumatic birth and stay in the NICU, and NOT EVEN TELLING YOUR WIFE!!! And thinking that her waking you up to do your part as a parent is not a big deal because other men are worse??And leaving her for most of the day to have fun with your parents who she didn\u2019t even agree to have visit?? This doesn\u2019t sound like PPD, it sounds like being reasonably pissed that the person who is supposed to be her partner is making her life astronomically more difficult in an already stressful time.", "YTA. There is a lot of \u201cme me me\u201d coming from you. You didn\u2019t just have major surgery. You didn\u2019t just incubate two humans.

Seriously? *You* needed a break? You realize even planned c-sections take more than 3 weeks to heal from, right? Have you ever had a major surgery? Take that and multiple it by a shit ton for an emergency c-section. And your parents were nice enough to buy dinner when she didn\u2019t feel up to cooking? Why in the hell didn\u2019t you cook? She is still recovering from a major surgery! And learning to breast feed not one, but two infants! Breast feeding is no joke. \n\nSeriously, you\u2019re so painfully out of touch it\u2019s no wonder your wife resents you and love is lost. She doesn\u2019t have PPD just because she is struggling or doesn\u2019t love you. Take some damn accountability.", "YTA.

When my wife had a c section HER parents came to visit for a few weeks to help out. They mainly did the cooking for us, what did I do? I stayed up till 7am every day to do the night shift so my wife could sleep and recover while also pumping. I would sleep at 7 and get up around 10am-11 and I didn\u2019t go out hiking and having fun with my parents.

I'm sorry you're tired but an entire HUMAN BEING has exited your wife and you invite your parents to stay for a WEEK???\n\nYou're trying to be a good host?

At three weeks postpartum, your wife is not even at the halfway point of physical recovery from major abdominal surgery. Her hormones are still all over the place; she is the food producer for two human beings and is just starting to figure out what it means to keep two helpless people alive. Even if she is suffering from PPD, your response as her partner should be compassion and kindness to her. If you think this process is harder on you than the person who spent nine months growing two human beings then got to have her abdomen sliced open and internal organs rearranged and then sewn back up, you're utterly delusional. And unless you're a licensed medical professional or therapist, you don't get to diagnose depression. Should she get that diagnosis (and her reaction to all the shit you've pulled seems perfectly reasonable; I don't blame her for leaving you \u2014 I would), you don't get to wield that diagnosis against her. You do the work to learn how to help her through this time. Maybe you should try to find some empathy. Btw, your wife and your two babies are your family now, and you need to do everything you can to support them. Your parents can get over it.", "YTA. \n\nMaybe she has PPD, maybe she doesn\u2019t. But you\u2019re not her doctor and you can\u2019t know that.\nBut even if she does, you are a total AH for not taking any accountability for your behavior and throwing her under the bus by blaming her emotions on PPD.\n\nYou\u2019re being really self centered right now and it\u2019s ridiculous that you can\u2019t see that. While your wife is at home recovering from a c section and caring for twins (btw, breastfeeding a single baby itself is literally equivalent to a full time job) you are bike riding and site seeing all day with your parents?!?\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask for them to be over, you made an assumption and ignored her feelings based on what you want. Recovering from a c section is really hard and vulnerable. The mom has a right to make boundaries on hosting.\n\nYou acted like a really bad partner in a time she needed you the most.", "This seems so trite it cannot be real.", "YTA. What the EFF. You invited your parents to stay without even asking your wife??!! She's post partum!!! She probably doesn't have PPD, she's probably just in total despair that her husband is incapable of recognising her needs. Good for her for finally advocating for herself and telling you how it is. You've acted like a total jerk to her.", "YTA\n\nOk first thing your wife just had a major surgery. She is in a lot of pain. When my mom has had C-Sections she is completely wiped out for awhile. She is in a lot of pain, she barely move, and she is exhausted but can't sleep. I'm sure your wife is going through all of that if not more. My mom never fully recovered from her last C-Section and it's been like 6 years. Yet your acting like your wife should be back to normal???\n\n2nd why are you acting surprised that your wife wants her mom there but not your parents??? Her mom is helping while your parents are acting like it's a vacation. It would make more sense to me that if your so sleep deprived you would want to maybe sleep those 5-6 instead of going to fun places. So your getting a vacation but your wife isn't. \n\n3rd no one should be amazed over your \"amazing dad skills\" because you get up some nights with the baby. Wow you did the bare minimum. You are a parent. You are expected to get up a night to help with ykur kid\nMeanwhile your wife pumps, also gets up some nights, she's cooking, taking care of the house, taking care of TWO newborn babies during the day. But yes you have it soooo much harder. It's so much harder to be able to go on a literal vacation 6 hours a day while your wife has it soo easy doing the parenting.\n\n\nAnd lastly you're treating your wife like some inanimate object. \"I'm sorry she has PPD dont hold it against her\" Did you seriously say that when she in the room. That is so beyond condescending and offensive. You're not her doctor either. However, it doesn't take a genius to figure out she's so upset because of how you treat her and then you act like your amazing and have it so much harder. You have it so much easier than your wife who is recovering from surgery but is still a parent 24/7 while you at least get to go on vacation with your parents.\n\n\nMassive YTA", "You are, indeed, the asshole. Let me count the ways. \n\nAre you a licensed clinician who is qualified to diagnose PPD? No? Then stop it. \n\n\nYou\u2019ve been home a week and your wife has had an uninterrupted sleep if six hours at most 2-3 times by your account, since she\u2019s had to get up a \u201chandful\u201d of times. Also, comparing yourself to other men who do less than minimum parenting is not a good look. \n\nExhaustion is not PPD.  Your wife is exhausted and you are minimizing everything g about her recovery and experience. Get your head out and man up. You are not hosting guests right now. You are beginning to parent. Get up and parent and be an actual partner. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m very concerned about your back. \n\nIt must be under intense strain as your head is apparently wedged a long way up your bottom.  \n\nRight. Let\u2019s go through it. \n\n\u2018Emergency C section\u2019. This is a major operation done at speed where a team of doctors barrel you into theatre, cut you open, tear your abdominal wall apart, then scoop out about 7kg of flesh in the form of babies. They then do their best to put that all back together again. However, it always takes time for everything to heal, hence why you\u2019re not supposed to life anything heavier than your baby. \n\n\u2018Visitors\u2019 are a loaded concept post partum. Her mum will be helping her look after herself and her babies, and maybe even doing things like helping her get washed and dressed. \n\nPumping. Serious kudos to your wife for managing to pump and breastfeed both twins. Pumping every two hours is hardcore. She may well be sore from all the friction on her breasts/ nipples and she will need to keep her fluid and nutritional intake up. Breast milk production is also linked to bonding with the babies and the emotional well-being of the mother, so an emergency c section and a nicu stay won\u2019t have helped that. Despite all of that, she\u2019s managed to kick ass and get that breast milk going. I\u2019m sending her a virtual high five. \n\nNext. What goes in a baby must come out. The babies don\u2019t just need feeding, they needing cleaning and changing. This is also hard work. Babies at this age need changing after every feed a lot of the time. So every time you waltz off out of the house, you leave her to feed and change two newborn babies by herself whilst recovering from surgery that makes Alien vs Predator look tame. \n\n\u2018The night shift\u2019. You need to put some big boy panties on and get a grip. Get your butt out of bed and sort those babies out. Yes, sleep deprivation is hard and it\u2019s not nice. You haven\u2019t been ripped in half and you haven\u2019t got either two babies or two pumps attached to your breasts. Suck it up and get on with it. Wake up when the babies cry- don\u2019t rely on your wife. She\u2019s not your mummy, she\u2019s the mummy to your two twins, who you helped to make. \n\nYour parents. They also need to remove their head from their bottoms. This isn\u2019t a place to have a holiday. This is a house with two newborns and a post partum mum. If you set toe in that house, you better be prepared to help with chores, bring in shopping, change some nappies etc. You don\u2019t waltz in and out like it\u2019s a hotel. \n\n\u2018\u2026.when she didn\u2019t feel up to cooking.\u2019 Excuse me?! Why is this woman lifting a finger in the kitchen?! Do you have arms?! Get in there and make the lady some nutritious food so she has the strength to produce milk and feed your babies! Why are your parents not offering to cook?! \n\nThen, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: you shift the blame on to your wife by patronisingly saying that she\u2019s not behaving the way you want her to because she\u2019s got PPD. \n\nNo. She\u2019s not behaving the way you want her to because your expectations are entitled, outrageous and ridiculous. You have been utterly selfish and thoughtless. \n\n\u2018I just want to get my wife the help she needs\u2019. Too late, she\u2019s figured that out for herself. She\u2019s packed herself and the babies up and headed for her parents house. You know what that means? She will get peace and quiet. Her parents will feed her and bring her stuff that she needs. They will help with the babies but also remember to think about her- the woman whose body has just been stretched and pushed and torn apart, who\u2019s so tired but pushing through for her babies. \n\nIf you want to be a father to those babies, give yourself one heck of a talking to. Right now, you don\u2019t deserve them- you have failed their mother utterly and you don\u2019t have a shred of insight. If you want to start fixing this, start by sending your parents home and apologising, then getting to work in the kitchen and the house. I bet there\u2019s laundry to be done, meals to be prepped and the house needs cleaning. Crack on and don\u2019t whine about it. \n\nTl, dr: grow up and try being a father, not an entitled child.", "YTA- you failed BIG time.  You need to beg your wife to forgive you, tell your parents to apologize as well and hope she does, if she doesn't, well you won't have to worry about being a parent, not that you did anyway.", "I hope this is a troll. I really do. Your poor wife. You're so worried about her mental health that you leave her with two brand new infants to go out for hours every day so you can entertain your parents who should be there to help, not as guests. YTA\n\nYou know what my favorite thing about c-sections is? When most people have major surgery, they're encouraged to rest and recover. New moms are handed a baby (or two) and treated like the worst mother and wife ever if they don't come bouncing out of the hospital ready to take care of the new baby(ies), keep the house clean, and cook for everyone.", "YTA- The dismissive tone of your entire post is disgusting. Praising your parents for buying dinner because your wife \u201cwasn\u2019t up to cooking\u201d for people she didn\u2019t ask to visit 3 weeks postpartum with twins? Don\u2019t even get me started on how grossly dismissive you are of her pumping. Saying how she\u2019s only had to wake you up some and that\u2019s \u201cbetter than most guys.\u201d You and your parents are off adventuring. No where in your post have you pointed out where your parents helped at all. Her mom helps her. Why aren\u2019t your parents helping you during your night hours? Oh\u2026right. Y\u2019all are tired from all your shopping and bike riding. \n\nAnd the cherry on top of it all that surely shows how little you value your wife, you blame it all on PPD. If she has PPD, you\u2019re a huge factor in causing it. No wonder she packed up the babies and ditched you. You\u2019re so beyond unaware of every step of your assholeness.  She grew and birthed two humans and you\u2019re being very pathetic.", "YTA YTA YTA! Her mom is not a \u201cvisitor,\u201d your parents are since you have to entertain them for hours during the day.

Your wife just carried twins for nine months, is going through post-partum shit, taking care of two babies and you think you have it harder than her? Grow the fuck up.\n\nNow that you have the house to yourself,  you'll have all the time in the world for your mental health/s\n\nJust so pissed off at you right now.

My wife gave birth to twins 3 weeks ago via emergency c section and a little over a week ago we finally got home from the NICU. I think in my exhaustion I forgot to mention it to her; but my parents decided they wanted to visit our first week home and I worked out all the details with them. \n\nThis was when the crying started. My wife has always had a great relationship with my parents so I thought she\u2019d be happy to see them but she was really upset when they showed up. I know from reading the questionnaires that not finding happiness in things that previously made you happy is a sign of PPD. I  know she\u2019s ok with visitors right now because her mom is here helping.\n\nThe twins are a lot of work so my wife has been pumping every 2 hours to allow us both to bottle feed. She said it\u2019s because she\u2019s having trouble with the babies nursing but I think it\u2019s just so she doesn\u2019t have to get up to feed them at night and can have me do it. I\u2019ve been struggling to wake up and stay awake to take care of them for my 6 hour night block but I\u2019ve been pretty good. My wife has only had to wake up during my shift a handful of times when I was sleeping which I feel like is way better than most guys. And on top of it when my wife is awake her mom helps her so really it\u2019s harder for me.\n\nMy sleep deprivation has gotten unbearably  mentally to the point where I need a mental reset to be a good dad and partner. My parents wanted to do some exploring in the area anyway so each day they were here I would spend time with them trying to be a good host. Bike rides and hikes with my dad and shopping trips with my mom during the day. I\u2019m only out of the house for maybe 5-6 hours max each day and help with the babies when I get home. \n\nA few days into my parents stay my wife said she no longer loves me and resents me for not caring about her or our kids and leaving during the day/\u201ctreating my PPL like a vacation\u201d. She also said that she wanted my parents out in a really rude way right in front of them. I was really embarrassed for her because they were nice enough to buy us all dinner multiple times when she didn\u2019t feel up to cooking. I told my parents to excuse her behavior but that she had postpartum depression so we shouldn\u2019t hold it against her. She packed up the babies and herself in the car and drove with her mom to her parent\u2019s house. I\u2019m doing everything I can to contact her doctor about her PPD because I\u2019m really worried about her and love her so much. I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH here for mentally resetting so I could better support my family and trying to get my wife the help she needs. Am I really the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Go back and read all of that like a stranger wrote it and see if you still feel that you aren\u2019t T-A. She (probably) doesn\u2019t have PPD, you\u2019re just a crappy partner/father.", "Omg the bar is in hell.... Yes! YTA! \n\nFirst, a c-section is major abdominal surgery. Depending on her recovery and pain management her mobility and activity may be severely limited. Next, pumping is physically taxing as is nursing. Third, guests need to be announced and consented to ahead of time. She is not at her best and the 4th trimester is real. Moreover if you have to \"entertain\" your parents, theh aren't very helpful anyway. Fourth, of course she is pissed you are taking off for hours a day! She needs your support and help. You are the FATHER. Getting up at night to help does not make you a martyr or hero. It is just what needs doing.\nAnd finally, you are not a doctor. PPD is likely, but it is not your place to diagnose. \nParenting is hard and this is a huge transition period for both of you but remember her body has just been theough a trauma. She needs you. The twins need you. And thinking your efforts make you \"better than most guys\" does not reflect well on you.", "I had twins via c-section. OP, you are a malignant, gaping AH. You think you have it harder? Your body did NOTHING, you contributed nothing with your body, except orgasming. The mom had major surgery, a c-section is MAJOR surgery - something so many people fail to grasp. You only miss a few of your times feeding the babies, so you deserve a medal?! You should be crawling on your hands and knees on glass if that is what your wife needs from you right now. I am too close to this situation, but I personally hope she leaves your worthless self.", "Let me tell you from someone who has a 6 week old and is suffering PPD, YTA.\n\nYour wife has had major abdominal surgery with twins and her body is trying to recover. Even when babies come out of the sunroof, nature is still a b*tch and you still bleed like you would after a vaginal delivery. On top of that, she's pumping. It can be painful and if you don't do it in a timely manner, your breasts leak and become lumpy and engorged. I ended up back in hospital severely unwell with mastitis from trying to pump/breastfeed. Nursing can be so damn hard but you appear to think she's doing it to spite you in order to get more sleep. \n\nThis is supposed to be your time not only bonding with your children but supporting your wife. Instead you have invited additional people into your home who I doubt she can truly be uncomfortable and in pain in front of. Just because her mum is there doesn't mean you can take off for 5-6 hours a day entertaining your parents! This is a visit that could have happened months further down the line after you have both found your groove as new parents and she has found a way to manage her days being at the beck and call of not one, but two new babies.\n\nIF she does indeed have PPD, you don't go declaring that to your parents.  We shouldn't be embarrassed about it but for some mothers it's hard to admit we are struggling when everyone expects us to be head over heels in love with motherhood straight away. \n\nI accept I may be projecting a little here lol but do her a favour, send your parents on their way and don't invite anyone else over without discussing it first! And don't go diagnosing her when it could just be a natural hormonal reaction to a major life changing event!", "YTA big time. I love my in-laws, but I did not want them to visit when the week I had my baby. My mom was there bc she's my mom, and I feel comfortable enough around her to help out without having to act like a host. Also pumping is extremely hard work. It is exhausting and sucks the life out of you. You burn lots of calories pumping for a reason. If my husband pulled the shit you did I'd be so pissed...I'd be raging and no it wouldn't be the ppd. You suck.", "Um shouldn\u2019t you be doing the cooking etc dude?", "Um shouldn\u2019t you be doing the cooking etc dude?", "YTA. She is right about everything. You love her \u201dso much\u201d? Then why not be there for her and your babies instead of leaving for fun time with your parents. She should be grateful she only had to cook when she had the energy? She shouldn\u2019t have to cook at all. You and your parents should have done that all the time. The tree of you are a black hole of AHs and your actions led to your own wife falling out of love with you. First time with babies are incredibly difficult and where were YOU? Out having fun with your parents. You showed her exactly how much she can depend on you. Zero. So she did the smart thing and left.", "YTA\u2026. Like so incredibly an asshole\u2026.. your wife had an emergency c section 3 weeks ago and you think she should feel grateful you so a couple of night feeds and that your parents bought her a couple meals when she didn\u2019t feel up to cooking?? \n\n3 weeks post c section she should still barely be moving around\u2026. I actually can\u2019t even understand how you wrote this pipe of crap and couldn\u2019t see what an AH you are\u2026 \n\nAnd saying she has PPD just because you are being an AH? Honestly I don\u2019t even know how to respond to that\u2026 what exactly are \u2018all the signs\u2019 she has PPD? Expecting you to be a father doesn\u2019t mean she has PPD\u2026.. \n\nDuring your mental break and reset did you consider she might need one? Did you ask her how she was coping with the lack of sleep + hormones + recovery from major emergency surgery + the pain and mental tool pumping/breastfeeding has? Or were you just only thinking about the fact you were tired\u2026. If you were that exhausted you wouldnt have been out with your parents, you would have been sleeping while they helped with the babies\u2026. Visitors who need to be \u2018hosted\u2019 after the birth of a baby sounds ridiculous, they should have been there to spend time with the babies and help\u2026 just like her mom is doing\u2026.", "YTA, you are such an AH. Your parental leave is not a vacation. She carried your TWO babies for 9 months and had a massive abdominal surgery three weeks ago... I can assure you, your exhaustion is not worse than hers. Pumping is so much work, logistically and physically. But your AITA question was about telling your parents she has PPD and for that, you are also an asshole. Being aware of the symptoms is one thing, but diagnosing her is an whole level.", "Dude YTA and if your lucky your wife may eventually come home. If she\u2019s smart, she won\u2019t.

I really hope you can read the sarcasm in my saying that your such a great dad. Honestly they aren\u2019t even a month old yet and your already absent from the life of your family. Congratulations.", "YTA. And you just sound like a petty child. Your wife's pumping so she doesn't have to get up and making you feed your babies? She still has to wake up to pump to keep up her supply I'm assuming . Not to mention pumping is pretty much a full time job  the first few months between pumping the milk, feeding babies, cleaning all the pump parts and repeat.", "YTA for a lot of reasons, but the biggest reason that stands out is the fact you're going out 5-6 hours a day entertaining your parents like it's their vacation.", "Er no. She doesn't have PPD. She has an AH for a husband. YTA. You invited your parents over just after she had major surgery and delivered two babies and you didn't ask if she wanted them there. There's a difference between wanting your own mum there to help and having your MIL around you while you are in pain, bleeding, possibly trying to breastfeed etc. I would not have wanted my MIL to stay in my home after having a baby and I only had singletons and didn't have surgery.\n\nThe sleep deprivation isn't worse for you. She's just had surgery and it probably hurts to even lie down. I only had keyhole abdominal surgery to compare but I was not able to lie down for 8 days as the pain was too bad. She's got a C section scar so goodness knows how bad that feels.\n\nYou didn't send your parents away as soon as she started crying. It was obvious she didn't want them there. \n\nYou are spending 5 to 6 hours away doing fun stuff and thinking about recharging your batteries while you delegate the job of husband and father to her parents. You should have been helping her, that's your job. She can't just decide to go out for 6 hours a day and leave the babies with you.\n\nYou ignore her feelings until breaking point and then patronize her by blaming her feelings on a mental health disorder. No, not all women's problems are caused by hormones. She's rightly very upset that you have not been a husband to her at a painful, exhausting transition in your lives. You have proved you cannot be relied upon and that you will belittle her emotions and blame your own shortcomings on PPD. I'm not surprised she's moved out. You could start by sincerely apologizing, promising to involve her in all decisions regarding visitors and actually be a dad to your babies. But you might have nuked your marriage. I'd think twice about coming back if I was in her situation.", "YTA\n\n1. Spending all your time having fun why your parents while she is at home taking care of the baby you both made\n\n2. Acting like her completely reasonable reaction to your obnoxious behavior can only be PPD\n\n3. If you did have an actually good reason to believe she has PPD, why is your first instinct to tell your parents instead of talking about it with her?", "YTA- I also had twins via c section.  Almost everything you said was blood boiling.\n\nYou should have checked with her again. Babies being in the NICU fucks with your PP hormones even more. Things changed.\n\nBreastfeeding twins is super hard. And pumping is exhausting. I was like your wife, every 2 hours around the clock... You have no idea how draining it is.\n\nYou shouldn't be telling people about a diagnosis for someone else, especially when it hasn't been professionally diagnosed. And if it is PPD, all you have done is feed into the anxieties and fears it's already causing.", "ESH\n\nY'all have issues.\n\nYou seem...not here. At all. You *forgot* to tell your wife about a week long visit? You're extremely sleep deprived and saying you're veering towards a mental breakdown. Your response has been to basically check out and retreat to ditching your wife and kids all day, every day of this visit. You live like a troll who only emerges at night while no one sees, and never sleep, but instead go on many distracting adventures that keep you absent and shambling like a zombie. \n\nYou have written some frankly bizarre things here that meander and just don't make sense.\n\nI am of the opinion that dads do deserve and need help, support, and breaks, and that the wife doesn't get to hoard all of the resource, though she needs the larger portion. Your need for *your* parents to support  *you* is a valid one which should not be vetoed or trampled on (negotiated within reason, yes, but not bulldozed). It is very clear you feel resentful and taken advantage of, like your wife has dumped the majority of care on you and your MIL and checked out to sleep and sit in a cushion eating bon bons. I cannot tell if that is accurate, or if you're so sleep deprived, your view of things has become skewed and twisted. It's also clear you no longer get any mental or emotional solace from your wife, and have been relying on your parents to provide it instead, which is not a good sign for your relationship.\n\nI'm also pretty certain you are super resentful of your MIL's presence, want her to go away, and you invited your own parents as a \"neener-neener, if you get your mom, I get mine, so deal, because I have,\" thing, though perhaps subconsciously done.\nI think the stress of supporting your wife through a month of NICU visits and the sleep deprivation have turned you into a zombie ghost just sort of drifting around the house, and following your parents around when they leave.\n\nI am going to recommend YOU get a mental health check, and set up some support systems for YOU. Rather than focusing on your wife having PPD (which is possible, but second to you getting your head back on first). \n\nMake some small efforts and gestures to remain in contact, don't totally ghost, but get your shit together so you can handle this.", "YTA. My husband stayed both times after my recovery from my c-section for as long as his fmla would allow. He didn\u2019t \u201chost\u201d or do anything outside of the house aside from running to the store if we needed diapers, etc. and I wasn\u2019t feeling up to bring one or both boys to the store. Also as someone who breastfeeds two kids at once (19.5mo and 6.5mo) it is incredibly hard to navigate especially when there is immense pressure when one is crying and you\u2019re trying to feed the other, so I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what pumping for two every two hours is like, especially when your only help is your mom because your own husband is too incompetent to recognize how hard it is to do, especially when alone with two newborns for hours at a time because they are off diddlydalling with their parents. Good for her for leaving with them and staying with her parents who are actually supporting her during this healing time and transition into parenthood.", "Noticed this too.

There is no possible way you 'forget' to tell your wife that your parents are staying for a week in any circumstances ever, but especially when you are in an extremely vulnerable time post birth with newborns.  Also, her mother visiting is not the same as yours - her mother visiting is not permission to invite yours without telling her. Inviting anyone over when you wife is post birth without telling her is always an asshole move.\n\nIf you have six hours in the middle of the day you should be using them to sleep so you can take care of the babies at night.  Or watching the babies so your wife can nap.  Or cleaning the house or cooking meals or doing laundry.  You are acting like the mom is the default baby care unit and you are 'helping' but should get time off - while the wife gets zero time off to recover from bithing TWINS.\n\nAlso - wtf are the parents doing going on bike rides and taking the new father out of the house???? If you visit someone who just had a baby you are there to HELP or you should get the f**k out.  They should be cooking meals and doing laundry and sweeping the floors.  Taking their son away from his new babies is the least helpful thing you can possibly do.  No wonder she didn't want them to come.\n\nDude - your wife has it much harder than you and you are acting like you need a special break and get it by dumping more work on her.  Her body is recovering from building those precious babies from scratch and then pushing them out - her body is also producing all of their food which is exhausting.  You should be doing everything possible to reduce her stress and give her breaks and nap time and relaxing time, not ditching her and making it clear your parents are your priority.  You failed her at her most vulnerable.  She is flooded with hormones right now and her hind brain is telling her you can't provide for or protect her and she isn't safe with you.

This is Mr Bean levels of idiocy. Can anyone actually be this clueless?", "Even if she HAD been formally diagnosed it would be an AH move to share that with anyone without permission.", "Late preterm babies (35 -38 weeks) are notoriously tricky feeders. I make this assumption since you mention NICU. Their mouths are tinier and don't sustain a proper grip on an adequate percentage of the areola. They often tire quickly. When the goal is for them to establish a stable rate of growth, bottle feeding to ensure proper nutrition at least several time/day is the safe and recommended way in the first few weeks. It's also challenging when managing TWO preterm infants. She could probably tell you that she learned that from the lactation consultant in the NICU. Pumping is a time-consuming pain in the butt and the 30 minutes of pumping is followed by 15 minutes of cleaning the parts and boiling them once a day. No sane person would ever suggest this is the easy way out.\n\nI'm not going to address the remainder of your AHery. Other people have covered all of that fine.

Finding it really hard to believe that it only came up in conversation the once.\n\nI\u2019d love to see your medical qualifications for deciding that she has PPD. Even if you have some, which I doubt, you don\u2019t get to diagnose family.\n\nGoing out with your parents for so long is beyond stupid and selfish. Your parents are TA as well for not realising that if they are staying there, it is time to ask her what she would like help with. \n\nApologise now and count your blessings. I\u2019d have thrown you out permanently for your behaviour.", "YTA, very oblivious and inconsiderate as well.  There's a huge difference in HER mother helping her versus you telling YOUR parents they can visit without even consulting her.  Next, you don't get to armchair diagnose her and then announce it.

This has to be rage bait.\n\n Find your brain and reinstall.", "YTA\n\nI didn\u2019t read beyond you spending time with them to be a good host. \n\nHer mom is helping right now.

What exactly are you doing?", "You couldn't be that worried about your wife's PPD if you are prepared to entertain your parents outside of your home for hours. It's absurd for you to moan and grown about being sleep deprived and then look on at your wife struggling with the same issue and dismiss her feelings about having too many people in the house all while she heals no less. \n\nYou literally accused your wife of pumping just to get you up and for her to avoid doing so in your post. You have shown your ass now own it.", "Yta. And I'm not going to heap on you because everyone has explained so well what you've done wrong.

Your wife gave birth 3 weeks ago she has super guests at her door.  Then pumping 2 hours isn\u2019t easy. It is work, hard work.  The. You say I do better than most guys. Here is an idea have your mom get up with you to help with the babies. That way it will be easier for you. \n\nAnd if your wife didn\u2019t feel like cooking because she gave birth a few weeks earlier to two babies you should be the one cooking.

And your wife has to feed two. And she's getting up every two hours so she can't actually get good sleep. Ever. My preemie didn't for months and it was awful. I also had to get up every two hours for a few weeks at the beginning. It is legit sleep deprivation. I don't remember a lot of it. \n\nYou are playing the comparison game. \"It's harder for me.\" Well, you didn't have your insides sliced open, you can laugh without pulling stitches.

Pumping milk isn't easy either, nor comfortable. I can't believe you think your wife is pumping milk just to get out of anything. YOU try having that device on your nipples for hours on end and see how you like it. \n\nDo you know why your wife cried when you said your parents would be over? Because she knows that she's not going to get any help from them, AND now she's going to be uncomfortable healing in her own home. She's potentially still bleeding from her C-section, is uncomfortable and bloated, while still having to care for two babies. She's comfortable with her mom, of course, because her mom can help her do things like go to the washroom, and change her dressings, or let her be topless if she wanted to when she's pumping. Are your parents helping with anything? Not at all, in fact, they're taking time away from one of the few sources of help - YOU, because you're spending all of your energy hiking or shopping (???? WTF) instead of helping a sleep-deprived mother. \n\nDon't go on about being worried about her PPD, because you're doing absolutely nothing to help with the situation. Words. Don't. Mean.

Others have said most of how I feel, bit the one point I haven't seen is where you lower the bar  for yourself by saying \"which I feel is way better than most guys\". I'm not sue what most guys do and neither do you, but that's completely irrelevant. You do the best job for you wife who just birthed not one, but TWO humans into this world, and for your children. \n\nHow well other father's do is irrelevant to how well you should be doing. If you're satisfied with anything less than your very best right now then you should be ashamed of yourself. Man up and do better. You and your parents are consistently prioritizing a large time away from your newborns and wife and I just don't understand it and it sounds extremely selffish and self-centered. \n\nBased on how you've presented yourself you not only seem like an asshole, but a very inconsiderate father and husband.", "How is her mom helping your wife harder for you lmao what", "Wow, I don\u2019t even know where to start\u2026 it just got worse and worse. \n\n> I think in my exhaustion I forgot to mention it to her; but my parents decided they wanted to visit our first week home and I worked out all the details with them. \n\nSuuure\u2026 you forgot.

Do you not want her to have any sleep? \n\n> I\u2019ve been struggling to wake up and stay awake to take care of them for my 6 hour night block \n\nPoor you. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want her to pump right? And you have 6 hours - she has 18! \n\n> My wife has only had to wake up during my shift a handful of times when I was sleeping \n\nDuuude!

And what are your parents doing? \n\n> My sleep deprivation has gotten unbearably  mentally to the point where I need a mental reset to be a good dad and partner. \n\nI get that it\u2019s tough but it\u2019s been 1 week, ONE!

And you know the difference as you are not worried about being a good hist to her. \n\n> I\u2019m only out of the house for maybe 5-6 hours max each day and help with the babies when I get home. \n\nHow many days in a row? When did you need a break? Seriously, you got yourself and your parents a nice holiday while your wife stays home. How would you react if she and her mom took off every day. For 6 hours, the hours you can\u2019t handle alone and complain about.

Because they are rude to her. By not helping and taking you away. \n\n> they were nice enough to buy us all dinner multiple times when she didn\u2019t feel up to cooking. \n\nWHAT?!? You can\u2019t be serious? You still expect her to cook?!? Again, what do you do when you\u201dhelp\u201d? Why not cooking. Wow, speachless\n\n> she had postpartum depression so we shouldn\u2019t hold it against her. \n\nSo you made her look insane and diagnosed her without any evidence? Husband if the year! \n\n> She packed up the babies and herself in the car and drove with her mom to her parent\u2019s house. \n\nGood, she\u2019ll have a supportive environment there and is not expected to cook and cater (and probably clean) for you and your parents. It\u2019ll drastically reduce her workload. And you can play host and catch up on sleep. Just what you wanted, isn\u2019t it? \n\n> \u2026 love her so much. \n\nDo you? Nothing in this post indicates that. Nothing at all. It\u2019s all me me me, my feelings, me. Nothing about her. \n\n> \u2026 so I could better support my family and trying to get my wife the help she needs. \n\nBut what did you really do?

Did you ever consider that your wife may usually enjoy your parents\u2019 company but right now she needs privacy? That\u2019s not cause for a diagnosis of PPD. My goodness that makes you sound so foolish. \n\n Her mother is not a guest btw - she is your wife\u2019s support system.\n\nYou didn\u2019t even ask your wife if you could have visitors, that is so very disrespectful.

And they do that pretty much autonomously. They're also about 20 feet long (combined ) So, you can just kinda... Grab the middle of them and move them. Because of how I was positioned, the docs needed to move the intestines completely out of the way, so they just... Picked them up and put them in a sterile bowl. That way they're contained, they won't fall on the floor, and they stay clean. But remember, they contract autonomously. And both the beginning and end are still connected. So as far as the intestines are concerned, they're just doing their thing. So they contracted to move some food along. Which makes them wiggle. Like squeezing a pipe or a piece of macaroni in the middle makes the ends move. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "As much as I love my husband, he elected to not be there when I was recovering from a mush less serious surgery.
