Controversial\u2026 \n\nI could be the A-hole but I need some fresh eyes. My mum always used to help with childcare because I have medical issues (cfs, anxiety, depression). I\u2019m a good mum and love being a mum unless I\u2019m having a flare up. When I had my third child my mum warned me she wouldn\u2019t be looking after the new baby because I could barely cope with the two I have. That seemed reasonable. So all last year she didn\u2019t help with the new baby. We moved house, my husband had his appendix out and I developed sickness bugs and back problems and we got minimal help from my parents which was really tough. After a year of suffering with the back pain I\u2019ve finally been diagnosed with a herniated disc after an MRI scan. I need to avoid picking up my 9 month old and 3 years old because it makes my back pain a lot worse. I\u2019m now on a lot of medication that makes me drowsy, especially once it\u2019s combined with my existing anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication. My mum was over today to help but complained when I needed to nap in the afternoon and said the following: \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not taking responsibility\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fault you have a bad back and if you keep lying down it won\u2019t get better\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to come over again if you\u2019re just going to sleep all the time\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve told her I\u2019m suffering with depression again at the moment. She helps out once a week usually. AITA because I want/ expect more support from her?\n\nEdit: someone rightly asked about my mum\u2019s age and health. She\u2019s in her 60s and struggles with arthritis so no, she\u2019s no spring chicken! I think it\u2019s taking me a while to adjust to the fact that my parents aren\u2019t invincible because they\u2019ve helped me so much in the past\u2026 too much perhaps which is why I\u2019m so useless now\u2026\n\nEdit 2: I sent this link to my mum and dad. I should also add that my mum has also started a new job and still works 3 days a week and my dad also still works full time (despite them both being in their 60s) They used to look after my younger two children at least twice a week including having them overnight regularly. I assumed this was normal? Clearly it isn\u2019t. Anyway! The takeaway from all of your helpful/not so helpful comments is that I\u2019m looking into paying for a childminder so that my mum and I can actually start going out together on our own again, lunch, shopping etc\u2026. I miss her company\n\nEdit 3: this thread has opened up a debate about whether people with a chronic illness or disability should have children\u2026.

It's not fair to your parents or your children.", "I think you need to spend some serious time with the mental exercise of imagining what things are like for her. How often is she in pain? How does she feel on a daily basis? How often do you think she's tired and her back hurts while she's doing YOUR WORK? How does she feel about approaching her final years, watching her own health decline, and having a child who doesn't have enough empathy to see it, and instead tries to pile on more work. How does she feel knowing she might leave this earth and her daughter has not learned to be an adult and take care of herself and her own children?\n\nIt looks like you have never had a plan to be an adult on your own. It seems unthinkable to you to stand on your own two feet, take responsibility for your own choices and do the work you created, not relying on your parents to pick up the slack. Most people do this on their own without regular free labor from their parents. You struggled with one child. Then you added a second child. Now you've added a third child. It's not like you had children you were managing to care for just fine and then catastrophe hit. You have never handled your life on your own. This is something adults do. A responsible adult can see that they can't manage their current load, and wouldn't take on more. They wouldn't decide, well this is what I want and someone else will just suffer for it so I can have mine.\n\nYour parents are in their 60s and have their own health issues. They need to be working less. Most people with parents that age are thinking about how to make their lives easier, not harder. This is what you sound like to a normal adult: \"My elderly mother is in pain on a regular basis but I fully expect she will do my work several days a week, in addition to her own. I'll bring another child into the world I can't care for because surely my mother will cave to my demands.\" Seriously? I'm sure you feel you love your mom, but you seem to have zero empathy and metric fuck ton of entitlement.", "No you didnt.", "the lesson isn\u2019t that your mom is not going to help. the lesson is that you are not entitled to her help.

She knew that she was going to have flare-ups in her depression and things like that and she took a chance and expected someone to pick up her slack when she couldn't.
