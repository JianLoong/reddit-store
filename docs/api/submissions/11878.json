What does that mean please? \n\nMoving this Edit 3 to the top: this thread has opened up a debate about whether people with a chronic illness or disability should have children\u2026. Controversial\u2026 \n\nI could be the A-hole but I need some fresh eyes. My mum always used to help with childcare because I have medical issues (cfs, anxiety, depression). I\u2019m a good mum and love being a mum unless I\u2019m having a flare up. When I had my third child my mum warned me she wouldn\u2019t be looking after the new baby because I could barely cope with the two I have. That seemed reasonable. So all last year she didn\u2019t help with the new baby. We moved house, my husband had his appendix out and I developed sickness bugs and back problems and we got minimal help from my parents which was really tough. After a year of suffering with the back pain I\u2019ve finally been diagnosed with a herniated disc after an MRI scan. I need to avoid picking up my 9 month old and 3 years old because it makes my back pain a lot worse. I\u2019m now on a lot of medication that makes me drowsy, especially once it\u2019s combined with my existing anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication. My mum was over today to help but complained when I needed to nap in the afternoon and said the following: \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not taking responsibility\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fault you have a bad back and if you keep lying down it won\u2019t get better\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to come over again if you\u2019re just going to sleep all the time\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve told her I\u2019m suffering with depression again at the moment. She helps out once a week usually. AITA because I want/ expect more support from her?\n\nEdit: someone rightly asked about my mum\u2019s age and health. She\u2019s in her 60s and struggles with arthritis so no, she\u2019s no spring chicken! I think it\u2019s taking me a while to adjust to the fact that my parents aren\u2019t invincible because they\u2019ve helped me so much in the past\u2026 too much perhaps which is why I\u2019m so useless now\u2026\n\nEdit 2: I sent this link to my mum and dad. I should also add that my mum has also started a new job and still works 3 days a week and my dad also still works full time (despite them both being in their 60s) They used to look after my younger two children at least twice a week including having them overnight regularly. I assumed this was normal? Clearly it isn\u2019t. Anyway! The takeaway from all of your helpful/not so helpful comments is that I\u2019m looking into paying for a childminder so that my mum and I can actually start going out together on our own again, lunch, shopping etc\u2026. I miss her company\n\nEdit 3: this thread has opened up a debate about whether people with a chronic illness or disability should have children\u2026.

It's not \"controversial...\"\n\nAlmost no one is taking your side. Even other disabled people and people with mental health issues are not taking your side. Think about that for a minute.\n\nYou made a very selfish decision and you put all the burden on your elderly mom, when she already told you -- she couldn't do it anymore.\n\nYTA", "Problem is she didn\u2019t realize how hard it was because her parents were helping out a lot. Very fortunate that they were able to do so for the first two kiddos.", "Why did you make the decision to continue having children when you were incapable of taking care of the ones you already have? It's not fair to your parents or your children.", "I think you need to spend some serious time with the mental exercise of imagining what things are like for her. How often is she in pain? How does she feel on a daily basis? How often do you think she's tired and her back hurts while she's doing YOUR WORK?

How does she feel knowing she might leave this earth and her daughter has not learned to be an adult and take care of herself and her own children?\n\nIt looks like you have never had a plan to be an adult on your own. It seems unthinkable to you to stand on your own two feet, take responsibility for your own choices and do the work you created, not relying on your parents to pick up the slack. Most people do this on their own without regular free labor from their parents. You struggled with one child. Then you added a second child. Now you've added a third child. It's not like you had children you were managing to care for just fine and then catastrophe hit. You have never handled your life on your own. This is something adults do. A responsible adult can see that they can't manage their current load, and wouldn't take on more. They wouldn't decide, well this is what I want and someone else will just suffer for it so I can have mine.\n\nYour parents are in their 60s and have their own health issues. They need to be working less. Most people with parents that age are thinking about how to make their lives easier, not harder. This is what you sound like to a normal adult: \"My elderly mother is in pain on a regular basis but I fully expect she will do my work several days a week, in addition to her own. I'll bring another child into the world I can't care for because surely my mother will cave to my demands.\" Seriously?

But the problem is that your mom isn't fine with it and understandably so - and she made it clear. Based on your comments, you seem a bit entitled and you didn't believe your mom on/in this, which was wrong. It would also be a bit different if this was about you needing the help for yourself because of your disabilities - I would be more sympathetic to that, because even though your mom still would have the right to decline and keep her boundaries, you didn't choose to exist and to be disabled... but the problem here is that you knew about your disabilities, that you're barely coping with two children, that you're relying on others heavily for their care and you decided to have another child. That's just isn't really the most responsible. It sounds a little bit child-ish, like doing what you want without looking at how it may affect others who are involved (your children, your mom - also based on your comments it seems like you didn't research beforehand how hard having kids might be, there seems to be really lot to unpack). \n\nAlso, you need to work on your anxiety (referring to the comment that you can even afford a nanny, but you don't do it due to anxiety).

I guess you don't want them to develop mental health issues from this whole situation... and what if they ended up needing a lot of help not only now, but as teenagers and young adults too? I'm a child of parents who more than likely have undiagnosed disabilities and in many ways they weren't able to properly care for me, it was a little bit selfish decision and all of my grandparents took care of me in many aspects. Also, surprise surprise, I'm more disabled than my parents: and it sucks that as a young adult, I have very little family support as my grandparents have been my closest people, approximately 70 years older than me... you need to think about your kids more and also appreciate the help from your parents, because it sounds like you have no (or very little) idea how much they're doing for you in terms of care.", "No, you shouldn't have had kids you can't take care of.

I also have 8 year old twin boys. Before they were even born I made sure I had a village that was stacked with people who could help. So things that I couldn\u2019t do didn\u2019t fall to one person. Also my husband is AB and was and is super hands on.", "I would say this even if you have no disabilities.

I have hEDS, POTS, and fibro, along with panic disorder, depression, and ADHD. While I had some of the symptoms of the physical issues throughout my childhood and teen years, it didn\u2019t truly affect me until the months after my third kid was born. I was originally misdiagnosed and the treatment was awful and I ended up having to stop working within three years. And while I knew as soon as I held my son that I was done having kids, the difficulties I had in the years following would have convinced me anyway. It would have been completely irresponsible to have another kid when it was all I could do to manage my preschool twins and toddler! Because, while I did have a lot of help from my in-laws during my pregnancy and maternity leave with my son, and my parents helped in the couple years after I left work, those kids are my responsibility. (Also their father\u2019s but he\u2019s\u2026a story for another post.) \n\nOP, I know it\u2019s hard. Like I said, I\u2019ve got the same kind of stuff you\u2019re dealing with and then some. All three of my kids also ended up with EDS of varying severity and POTS, along with ADHD, and one is autistic. I\u2019ve been a single mom for almost twelve years. We live nowhere near family except for my bf. You have a husband, right? Figure out a routine between you and your husband to take care of your kids and let your parents enjoy their time as grandparents instead of as babysitters.

I don't think it's ableist to say that you should factor in your injuries/mental health etc in your decisions. It's just realistic.\n\nMy mom also struggles with mental health so I know I wouldn't have a strong family support system in the event that my mental health got worse and I don't want my future kids to be a victim of those circumstances.", "I also have ME/CFS (severe at that) and yeah me and my partner will not be having children. Mostly because of my illness. I cant even take care of myself so no way Im gonna bring a kid into that. I cant think about getting children and then expect my mom to care for them like that. Big no no!", "Yup this has nothing to do with OP\u2019s disability, this has to do with not hearing her mom when she said she can\u2019t do childcare anymore. Instead of getting more help she just went along until a crisis hit. \n\nWhen you are disabled you do not have the luxury of not having multiple backup plans in place, especially if you have kids. Unfortunate but it is what it is. \n\nOP Cut acting the victim, you knew you needed a different support system than your mom and ignored it. This is coming from someone with a lot of chronic severe illnesses and disabilities.", "The thing about expecting the grandparents to be the support system is that they also get older, become less able to help, need care themselves, become disabled, or die . . . her failing to plan is planning to fail. She should have stopped at two.", ">If you're disabled and if you have a support system in place, you should be able to have as many children as you want.\n\nI\u2019m disabled (physically) and neurodivergent with some mental health issues. I agree and disagree, tbh. I think it\u2019s very important that disabled people have autonomy over their reproductive choices but people with disabilities also need to be pragmatic about their situations. A support system is great but support systems aren\u2019t always permanent. People die, people move away \u2014 then what? Can you care for your children on your own? That should be everyone\u2019s question before having kids, able bodied or disabled. \n\nAnd if, say, you have a disability that\u2019s almost guaranteed to significantly reduce your lifespan such that you aren\u2019t able to raise your kids to adulthood, then that\u2019s another situation when you shouldn\u2019t have as many kids as you want because the trauma/burden will get passed down to the older kids. If you have a highly inheritable disease that will significantly harm your child if it\u2019s passed on, probably also worth taking time to think about. But most important, imo, is the fact that no one should have kids they simply can\u2019t care for regardless of the reason.", "I'm no medical expert but I think the biggest problem here is her chronic entitlement.", "Indeed", "\"Why won't my children talk to me? \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\"", "As long as it is convenient for her, she is a good mom.", "\u201cMy son has the best support system because I saw the writing on the wall\u201d\n\nThis was absolutely part of our decision making process!

I'm gonna have a third kid, knowing I already CAN'T handle the two I have.\" \n\nAnd now you're shocked that mom really *did* mean it and has washed her hands of you.  YTA", "Yeah, I've had surgery for a herniated disc, I came in here ready to be on OP's side, but damn.  This didn't all happen after you had the kid.  You knew three was gonna be too much.  I don't know how old you are, but maybe you could've just held off on number three, get your back in order.\n\nMom is wrong about lying down, though.  Yes, having a strong core helps, but once it's fucked, it's fucked, and you probably need surgery.

I have been saying that since I was maybe 11 or 12 years old and I'm 34 now. My husband didn't want any either. But my medical issues just really reinforced that for me. I have degenerative disc disease in my lumbar spine and I'm not supposed to lift more than 15-20 pounds regularly. If we did decide to have a kid, that would put 100% of the lifting/carrying on my husband after the first year (I guess? I don't know how fast children gain weight exactly) and that seems really unfair to put on him. I have several other medical problems that make me constantly fatigued and I think that would make me suck as a parent, so I wouldn't want to put a kid in that situation anyway. So it was just more motivation to not ever do it.", "Same with me", "Me as well.
