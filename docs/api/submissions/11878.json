My mum always used to help with childcare because I have medical issues (cfs, anxiety, depression). I\u2019m a good mum and love being a mum unless I\u2019m having a flare up. When I had my third child my mum warned me she wouldn\u2019t be looking after the new baby because I could barely cope with the two I have. That seemed reasonable. So all last year she didn\u2019t help with the new baby. We moved house, my husband had his appendix out and I developed sickness bugs and back problems and we got minimal help from my parents which was really tough. After a year of suffering with the back pain I\u2019ve finally been diagnosed with a herniated disc after an MRI scan. I need to avoid picking up my 9 month old and 3 years old because it makes my back pain a lot worse. I\u2019m now on a lot of medication that makes me drowsy, especially once it\u2019s combined with my existing anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication. My mum was over today to help but complained when I needed to nap in the afternoon and said the following: \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not taking responsibility\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fault you have a bad back and if you keep lying down it won\u2019t get better\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to come over again if you\u2019re just going to sleep all the time\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve told her I\u2019m suffering with depression again at the moment. She helps out once a week usually. AITA because I want/ expect more support from her?\n\nEdit: someone rightly asked about my mum\u2019s age and health. She\u2019s in her 60s and struggles with arthritis so no, she\u2019s no spring chicken! I think it\u2019s taking me a while to adjust to the fact that my parents aren\u2019t invincible because they\u2019ve helped me so much in the past\u2026 too much perhaps which is why I\u2019m so useless now\u2026", "created_utc": 1678378763, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mwcrw/aita_mum_not_wanting_to_help_with_childcare_even/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only reason you had the third child is because you figured your mother would raise your third much like it sounds like she raised the first two so far; and that makes you not only an asshole, but a disgusting person in general.

You need to step it up and start being adults and parents. How fair is it to your mother? Your mother is 60 and with her own health issues.
