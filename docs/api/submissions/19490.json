I got chicken strips and began to eat when my mom said \u201c aren\u2019t you going to give ( baby) some?\u201d I said no, as she\u2019s already eaten. My mom then goes on a rent about how she taught me to have manners and to share.

I hope she didn't force food on you as a kid. Since it doesn't sound like moving out is an option, I would consult with your pediatrician and hopefully giving her the opinion of a doctor will get her to stand down on this craziness.", "NTA.  Your mother is teaching your daughter to eat whenever anyone else does, whether she is hungry or not.  She is teaching her not to listen to her own mother.  She is teaching her to do what granny tells her to do.  She is teaching her to misbehave until she gets what she wants.  Granny has already offered the solution.  Tell her no more eating around your child.", "NTA. Forcing a baby to eat when they aren't hungry is abuse. This is a horrible habit from your mother.", "NTA, and I\u2019d hold your ground if you can. Teaching your child to eat when she\u2019s hungry (instead of whenever it\u2019s \u201cpolite\u201d because other people are eating) is teaching her to listen to her own body and its needs. You\u2019re doing what\u2019s right to help her have a healthy relationship with food. Your mom is just being weird.\n\nBabies grow up to be adults. Should an adult have to have a snack every time someone else does regardless of when they\u2019re hungry?", "NTA.\n\nWhile it is good to eat when your child is eating there are certainly times you need to eat and they don't, or vice versa. Feeding a toddler is actually a fair amount of work and eating while they are eating ends up more of a shoving food into yourself while multitasking. \n\nI think your mom is typically grandma advise were she doesn't consider the logistics because she is not the one having to do it 6 times a day every day for the next 3 years.", "NTA 1) never feed your kid from your plate you will never have food of your own. Make them a plate. 2) over feeding a child is very unhealthy. 3) you\u2019re the mother she is grandmother you make the decisions she needs to respect them.", "NTA: it\u2019s already ate and doesn\u2019t need more food, but your mother is forcing a baby to eat can cause a lot of problems", "NTA. \n\nYour Mum would have hated me haha. I breastfed through all the toddler years and both my kids barely ate anything until almost eighteen months. I'd give them anything anytime they wanted - it's fkn *obvious* when kids want to eat something. But they honestly mainly got their bulk 'food' from BM. \n\nThey're both kids now and perfectly healthy, really good food habits and know how to listen to their bodies. It's good to only feed kids when they're actually hungry - it teaches them healthy habits so they don't become overeaters.\n\nMy kids have literally never done that childhood 'overeat until they've made themselves sick' bit.", "NTA. It's very important for children to have a feeding routine and not develop unhealthy habits. Your mother is training your daughter to associate other people's snacktime with her own, which isn't good. She doesn't need to be fed so frequently, her calorie needs are way lower. Your mother's reasoning is also quite strange and makes me think this is coming from something personal, not rational. You don't teach children to share by always sharing your stuff with them, if anything it'll just make them think that they can have some of yours whenever they see it. That's the opposite of learning to share!", "definitely NTA", "NTA Stay strong.", "It's a little unusual to not let your toddler share your meals- family meals become a big part of how kids are socialized- but you're not the ass for having separate meals from your toddler. But pragmatically, your mom is giving you free childcare and housing so it would be practical to accept this as an etiquette quirk that she has and accommodate while you're living there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
