I got chicken strips and began to eat when my mom said \u201c aren\u2019t you going to give ( baby) some?\u201d I said no, as she\u2019s already eaten. My mom then goes on a rent about how she taught me to have manners and to share.

Your mother is teaching your daughter to eat whenever anyone else does, whether she is hungry or not.  She is teaching her not to listen to her own mother.  She is teaching her to do what granny tells her to do.  She is teaching her to misbehave until she gets what she wants.  Granny has already offered the solution.  Tell her no more eating around your child.", "NTA. Forcing a baby to eat when they aren't hungry is abuse. This is a horrible habit from your mother.", "NTA, and I\u2019d hold your ground if you can. Teaching your child to eat when she\u2019s hungry (instead of whenever it\u2019s \u201cpolite\u201d because other people are eating) is teaching her to listen to her own body and its needs. You\u2019re doing what\u2019s right to help her have a healthy relationship with food. Your mom is just being weird.\n\nBabies grow up to be adults. Should an adult have to have a snack every time someone else does regardless of when they\u2019re hungry?", "NTA.\n\nWhile it is good to eat when your child is eating there are certainly times you need to eat and they don't, or vice versa. Feeding a toddler is actually a fair amount of work and eating while they are eating ends up more of a shoving food into yourself while multitasking. \n\nI think your mom is typically grandma advise were she doesn't consider the logistics because she is not the one having to do it 6 times a day every day for the next 3 years.", "NTA 1) never feed your kid from your plate you will never have food of your own. Make them a plate. 2) over feeding a child is very unhealthy. 3) you\u2019re the mother she is grandmother you make the decisions she needs to respect them.", "NTA: it\u2019s already ate and doesn\u2019t need more food, but your mother is forcing a baby to eat can cause a lot of problems", "NTA. \n\nYour Mum would have hated me haha. I breastfed through all the toddler years and both my kids barely ate anything until almost eighteen months. I'd give them anything anytime they wanted - it's fkn *obvious* when kids want to eat something. But they honestly mainly got their bulk 'food' from BM. \n\nThey're both kids now and perfectly healthy, really good food habits and know how to listen to their bodies. It's good to only feed kids when they're actually hungry - it teaches them healthy habits so they don't become overeaters.\n\nMy kids have literally never done that childhood 'overeat until they've made themselves sick' bit.", "NTA. It's very important for children to have a feeding routine and not develop unhealthy habits. Your mother is training your daughter to associate other people's snacktime with her own, which isn't good. She doesn't need to be fed so frequently, her calorie needs are way lower. Your mother's reasoning is also quite strange and makes me think this is coming from something personal, not rational. You don't teach children to share by always sharing your stuff with them, if anything it'll just make them think that they can have some of yours whenever they see it. That's the opposite of learning to share!", "definitely NTA", "NTA Stay strong.", "It's a little unusual to not let your toddler share your meals- family meals become a big part of how kids are socialized- but you're not the ass for having separate meals from your toddler. But pragmatically, your mom is giving you free childcare and housing so it would be practical to accept this as an etiquette quirk that she has and accommodate while you're living there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's setting up this weird expectation that you have nothing that's just yours, everything must be sacrificed for the child, which is an unhealthy and unsustainable mindset for both you and your kid.", "NTA. Google toddler serving sizes and show your mom\u2014it's honestly less than you think in a lot of cases. I have a 13-month-old who can eat and eat and eat, but I don't just let him gorge himself indefinitely. Your mom is definitely overstepping", "We do eat together the majority of times . But I tend to feed her on her hunger cues which may be before or after \u201cofficial meals\u201d . Most of the times it\u2019s just junk food that she doesn\u2019t need to be eating either ( spicy chips, candy etc.)", "Disagree. This is going to set the kid up with an unhealthy relationship with food if it continues.", "NTA what your mother doing is wrong and can cause eating problems. Nip this now and tell your mom she will not overfeed and stuff your child. If she wants to eat everytime she sees someone's else eat and have an unhealthy relationship with food then that's her choice.", "NTA. It's perfectly OK for a child to learn that sometimes other people will have different needs than them, or have those needs at a different time. If you feed her every time you eat you are setting yourself up for huge issues later on.\n\nI work strange hours, so my children are totally used to me having meals at different times from them, and are capable of understanding that this is OK.", "NTA wtf your mom's treating your daughter how I treat my dog. The only difference is my dog's not going to develop an eating disorder if this continues.", "NTA. This behavior is going to negatively impact her relationship with food. It\u2019s not healthy or safe. She needs to learn how to listen to her body and honor what it needs. And if she\u2019s sleeping she won\u2019t even know? Like what? Mom is definitely in the wrong", "Honestly, I have had to explain to my husband numerous times that it's ok to do things for ourselves without doing them for the kids as well.  Or to take a fair share of something, rather than letting the kids have all of it (this is usually regarding food, and never involves making the kids go short).  If you always sacrifice yourself for the kids, the kids become entitled.  They think they are entitled to things and deserve things.  I had to explain to my husband that we also deserve things, and the kids need to see that.\n\nSomehow they've survived to age 21 and 16.  And are not entitled.\n\nThis is exactly the scenario you are facing, and you are already experiencing your baby feeling entitled.  Obviously I don't blame the baby, as she's too young to understand any of it, but this is where it starts.", "NTA. As a parent-I HATE sharing food every time I eat, especially when my kid has already eaten. Plus- depending on the age, my food is not always safe for kids.", "NTA this makes no sense whatsoever. Even adults dont need food always at the same time as each other, a toddler has significantly lower requirements, why would she need to eat just bc you are??", "This!\n\nPerfect response!\n\nNTA OP. Keep raising YOUR child as you see fit.", "Agreed. Also, a lot of foods for adults (and older children) aren\u2019t good food for toddlers. Like fried chicken stripes, they are a bit too much fat and too salty for babies and toddlers. Salt can damage a baby and toddler real bad. Babies aren\u2019t allowed to have salty food like cheese for a reason. Or foods like honey. So it\u2019s child abuse to feed a child too much AND sometimes also dangerous. NTA.", "I agree with this. My youngest would eat at mealtime until she was done, and would say \"I not starving anymore\"---her way (at 2 and 3) of saying she was full. My mother would be an anxious mess, that she didn't clear her plate, or she was 'too skinny', or a thousand other things. Kids need to listen to their own body's cues."]}
