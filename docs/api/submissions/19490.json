You\u2019re doing what\u2019s right to help her have a healthy relationship with food. Your mom is just being weird.\n\nBabies grow up to be adults. Should an adult have to have a snack every time someone else does regardless of when they\u2019re hungry?", "NTA.\n\nWhile it is good to eat when your child is eating there are certainly times you need to eat and they don't, or vice versa. Feeding a toddler is actually a fair amount of work and eating while they are eating ends up more of a shoving food into yourself while multitasking. \n\nI think your mom is typically grandma advise were she doesn't consider the logistics because she is not the one having to do it 6 times a day every day for the next 3 years.", "NTA 1) never feed your kid from your plate you will never have food of your own.

I breastfed through all the toddler years and both my kids barely ate anything until almost eighteen months. I'd give them anything anytime they wanted - it's fkn *obvious* when kids want to eat something. But they honestly mainly got their bulk 'food' from BM. \n\nThey're both kids now and perfectly healthy, really good food habits and know how to listen to their bodies. It's good to only feed kids when they're actually hungry - it teaches them healthy habits so they don't become overeaters.\n\nMy kids have literally never done that childhood 'overeat until they've made themselves sick' bit.", "NTA. It's very important for children to have a feeding routine and not develop unhealthy habits. Your mother is training your daughter to associate other people's snacktime with her own, which isn't good. She doesn't need to be fed so frequently, her calorie needs are way lower. Your mother's reasoning is also quite strange and makes me think this is coming from something personal, not rational. You don't teach children to share by always sharing your stuff with them, if anything it'll just make them think that they can have some of yours whenever they see it. That's the opposite of learning to share!", "definitely NTA", "NTA Stay strong.", "It's a little unusual to not let your toddler share your meals- family meals become a big part of how kids are socialized- but you're not the ass for having separate meals from your toddler.

It's setting up this weird expectation that you have nothing that's just yours, everything must be sacrificed for the child, which is an unhealthy and unsustainable mindset for both you and your kid.", "NTA. Google toddler serving sizes and show your mom\u2014it's honestly less than you think in a lot of cases. I have a 13-month-old who can eat and eat and eat, but I don't just let him gorge himself indefinitely. Your mom is definitely overstepping", "We do eat together the majority of times .

Nip this now and tell your mom she will not overfeed and stuff your child. If she wants to eat everytime she sees someone's else eat and have an unhealthy relationship with food then that's her choice.", "NTA. It's perfectly OK for a child to learn that sometimes other people will have different needs than them, or have those needs at a different time. If you feed her every time you eat you are setting yourself up for huge issues later on.\n\nI work strange hours, so my children are totally used to me having meals at different times from them, and are capable of understanding that this is OK.", "NTA wtf your mom's treating your daughter how I treat my dog. The only difference is my dog's not going to develop an eating disorder if this continues.", "NTA. This behavior is going to negatively impact her relationship with food. It\u2019s not healthy or safe. She needs to learn how to listen to her body and honor what it needs. And if she\u2019s sleeping she won\u2019t even know? Like what? Mom is definitely in the wrong", "Honestly, I have had to explain to my husband numerous times that it's ok to do things for ourselves without doing them for the kids as well.  Or to take a fair share of something, rather than letting the kids have all of it (this is usually regarding food, and never involves making the kids go short).  If you always sacrifice yourself for the kids, the kids become entitled.  They think they are entitled to things and deserve things.  I had to explain to my husband that we also deserve things, and the kids need to see that.\n\nSomehow they've survived to age 21 and 16.  And are not entitled.\n\nThis is exactly the scenario you are facing, and you are already experiencing your baby feeling entitled.  Obviously I don't blame the baby, as she's too young to understand any of it, but this is where it starts.", "NTA. As a parent-I HATE sharing food every time I eat, especially when my kid has already eaten. Plus- depending on the age, my food is not always safe for kids.", "NTA this makes no sense whatsoever. Even adults dont need food always at the same time as each other, a toddler has significantly lower requirements, why would she need to eat just bc you are??", "This!\n\nPerfect response!\n\nNTA OP. Keep raising YOUR child as you see fit.", "Agreed. Also, a lot of foods for adults (and older children) aren\u2019t good food for toddlers. Like fried chicken stripes, they are a bit too much fat and too salty for babies and toddlers. Salt can damage a baby and toddler real bad. Babies aren\u2019t allowed to have salty food like cheese for a reason. Or foods like honey. So it\u2019s child abuse to feed a child too much AND sometimes also dangerous. NTA.", "I agree with this. My youngest would eat at mealtime until she was done, and would say \"I not starving anymore\"---her way (at 2 and 3) of saying she was full. My mother would be an anxious mess, that she didn't clear her plate, or she was 'too skinny', or a thousand other things. Kids need to listen to their own body's cues.", "NTA - but here is some advice and wisdom. Your mom is a god send. Keep her happy. No harm in complying with a ridiculous request even minimally (like a tiny bite).\n\nAddress this when you visit the pediatrician next. \n\nYour mom is raising your child for free. Don\u2019t let being right mess up the great situation you have.", "Nta.  Your kid is going to be so fat with that mentality.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom is simultaneously conditioning your child to be demanding/entitled (in the future,) and also to ignore her own hunger cues. This is, Pavlov-style, encoding your baby to want/need to eat just by seeing other people eat, vs how she feels. I know she's young, but the pieces for a  poor relationship with food/disordered eating come into play EARLY. Her little brain is teeming with pattern recognition as it builds her world, and your mom is creating compulsion.", "Nta and your mom is teaching your daughter terrible eating habits. In fact, she is creating the start of a potential eating disorder.", "NTA... your mom has a strange hangup.", "You are not an AH.  Don't let your daughter associate food with affection and attention.  kt", "NTA\n\nYour Mother is creating a rod for your back with her behaviour around your child. I am fairly sure that a 1 year old will not yet be eating on the same schedule as an adult - therefore, there will be times you eat and they don't.\n\nOnce a child is old enough to sit at the dining table, learn the correct use of cutlery etc and then you are all on the same eating schedule. Your Mother is teaching your child it is OK to have food when they aren't hungry and it's OK to have food off another person's plate.", "NTA. That sort of thing is how you teach a small child that they're entitled to and should expect some of what anyone around them is eating. They're not.   \n\n\nIt also teaches unhealthy eating habits, such as the expectation they have to eat anytime food is presented, whether they're hungry or not.  \n\n\nThis isn't a matter of teaching sharing. Sharing doesn't mean offering / consenting to share 100% of the time. You're allowed to have things just for yourself.  \n\n\nShe is doing more harm than good, and needs to remember who the mother is in this scenario, because its not her.", "NTA. One, this is your kid, not your Mom\u2019s. It\u2019s great she\u2019s helping with childcare, but that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to make parental decisions.\n\nTwo, this is actually setting up your kid for food/eating issues later in life. Babies are born able to regulate\u201cfull\u201d vs \u201chungry\u201d. Force feeding her teaches  her to ignore her body\u2019s signals and overeat. This is literally a medical issue. Maybe bring your mom with you to her Pediatrician and ask them to explain that.", "INFO: Did you develop eating disorders or issues because of how she fed you when you were growing up? Or is there some other, third perspective that both of you are missing here?", "NTA and your gonna need to put your foot down here. This isn't healthy for your kid to be eatting so much and if it continues it could lead to some real issues down the line.", "I don't see this as an AH situation.\nIf your baby expresses interest in what you're eating, and so long as it is safe for them (probably pass on the jalape\u00f1o poppers) you should give them some. Introducing new foods at a young age is important. People keep talking about \"force feeding\" when that's not happening here. If your baby shows interest, it's probably because they're hungry. They like snacks too.", "This. Invite your mother to the next doctor's appointment and then just casually ask the doctor \"oh by the way, my mother and I have a difference of opinion to do with my daughter's eating schedule, I was hoping you could give us your opinion. One of us thinks \"abc\" while the other thinks \"xyz\". We'd appreciate your thoughts\". You could even ask your mother to ask the question so as she presents it from her perspective and can't accuse you of bias.", "This is a good set up for an eating disorder. NTA", "No I haven\u2019t had any eating disorders or problems with food. I\u2019m an only child so I\u2019ve never had any outside perspective on how she fed me until now, assuming she did the same with me that she is my daughter", "Honey is a botulism risk for babies, I mention this just in case anyone doesn't know.", "Honey is only restricted in the states until 1 year old", "NTA. This sounds like a recipe for an eating disorder and lifelong issues with food.", "Nta - you know your child and you know your child\u2019s hunger cues. Don\u2019t let anyone make you doubt your parenting.", "NTA. Your Mum\u2019s antiquated way of thinking and guilt trips will steer your daughter to a life of entitlement (that creepy adult who tries to leech off your food plate) and potentially obesity (it\u2019s OK to eat just because it\u2019s there, not because you need it/are hungry).\n\nFurthermore, YOU are the child\u2019s mother, and a caregiver should follow your perfectly reasonable wishes as far as feeding.", "NTA. This is interesting because babies this age pull off the parent's plates by instinct. However they won't do it if they're full. Your mom might be getting her advice from something she heard in the past where toddlers try to eat off their folks' plates just to learn about foods. But you're right in that it's not necessary every time. You're wise to use discretion. And what about spicy stuff, things with hot sauce, a ton of salt or artificial flavors and colors? We grown folks find it delicious but we also outweigh the kiddo by at least 100 pounds. So it is not always good for the baby to eat what the grownups eat. Some foods are just not for kids. And you are wise to protect your daughter from expecting to share all food all the time, accordingly.", "Sorry for the analogy please don\u2019t get offended but it\u2019s like when i tell people to don\u2019t feed my puppy at the table because\n1.
