You're doing a brilliant job and please, please remember to look after yourself.\n\nThe first thing I have to address is my wife is not ableist, far from it. She's been an absolute rock for me through everything. Some examples are she; suggested I get diagnosed before we were even dating, encourages me to stim and indulge my special interests, despite wanting a big wedding she insisted we have a private official ceremony and a party after our honeymoon with scheduled rest breaks for me, she always checks in on me in all social situations and she even bought me the expensive noise-cancelling headphones. I don't deserve her but I'm grateful for her every single day. She's the best part of me.\n\nPerhaps because she's been nothing but supportive I automatically believed she was right about me caring for our daughter. But in this particular case she was in the wrong and has said so. She wasn't best pleased I'd asked strangers (I have her consent for this update) but understood why I did and had been thinking it over herself after seeing what it was doing to me. Turns out I wasn't anywhere near as good at hiding my meltdowns as I thought I was.\n\nAfter a lot of talking she said she felt angry and frustrated that (in her view) I was breezing through parenthood while she feels like she's drowning. What really hit me is when she said she feels like a bad mum and a failure. My amazing wife, the best mother I could ever imagine for our daughter, the woman with seemingly boundless love and care felt like she's failing as a mother. I wish she could see herself the way I see her just once. Part of me feels like I've failed her for not noticing how she was feeling, I think I was so caught up in my own joy that I missed her suffering.\n\nObviously we're not in a good place right now but we're going to talk to the health visitor about getting her the help she needs and what's available so she can get better but it sounds like PPD from what we've read. In the mean time I'm going to work from home 2-3 days a week once my manager has sorted the insurance out so she's not alone as much (the plan was for me to take the last 20 weeks of parental leave anyway), I'm going to book a session with my therapist, and the headphones are back. For both of us. She tried them a few days ago and said how much calmer and in control she felt, and how our daughter settles so much quicker. She's probably reading this and finding out that I've ordered her a pair and they'll be here Friday (if you are reading this, I love you).", "created_utc": 1684368934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kiw4b/aita_for_wearing_noise_cancelling_headphones_when/", "score": 3018, "replies": ["[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bi2pc/aita_for_wearing_noise_cancelling_headphones_when/)", "That\u2019s a great update!

I like hearing these kinds of updates. I love hearing how supportive she has been throughout your relationship. I want to send her a virtual hug just so she knows she is not alone. I had PPD after both my babies. It is super hard especially when it seems like your partner is having such an easy time\u2026it will be easier over time especially when she gets help.

Clever and well done.  To ignore crying baby would be awful, but you aren\u2019t, you are managing your stress quite cleverly.\n\nIn the terms of people saying silly things\u2026an elderly relative of mine picked up a baby, which cried. Relative said, \u201cit\u2019s my glasses, baby is scared\u201d.  But\u2026both both of baby\u2019s parents wore glasses.   So, that was nonsense.   Babies are used to what they see.  Yours has no idea what \u201chat\u201d you have on, and really doesn\u2019t care.  Baby can\u2019t see much more than your face, anyway.\n\nI hope your wife gets all the feedback and medical help that she needs.  I had PPD and even some psychosis. It really can suck.

It sounds like she has a supportive partner, and that is always helpful.", "Oh man, this made me cry. So lovely. You are lucky to have each other, and your daughter is lucky to have such a sweet and devoted mommy and daddy!", "This is such a lovely update, I hope some help from a therapist or an doc and more support from you can help decrease her PPD and help her see herself the way you do. Aw, good luck with the little one and the new headphones! :)", "I can understand why your wife feels like that. On top of doing all the physical labor (feeding, changing, bathing the baby, etc) she probably feels like she carries the full mental load. That's the counting of wet diapers, timing naps, feeding schedules, noticing patterns with gas, etc. IT'S A LOT. And I feel the dad's don't realize this. Her baby is alive, fed and clothed. She is being a good mom and glad she's getting help.", "> She's probably reading this\n\nOP, blink twice if you are safe", "I\u2019ve never read a post on Reddit that made me tear up with joy.

As a fellow autistic person, this sub is very helpful and educational.", "Jumping on here to suggest maybe your wife could also get a pair of noise cancelling headphones.", "Nah seriously, I\u2019m actually welling up right now.

We have three pairs at home for our 2 boys (they grew out of the baby pair and needed new ones as they got older) and everytime their sister cried rhey would grab them and wear them, even found my 7M asleep with them on one night while 1F was teething. Every famiky member needs to find their own way to survive a crying baby and those head phones are awesome.", "Wish I\u2019d been able to comment in the original! Our baby had colic and would scream 5 hours straight no matter what we did. The doctor confirmed nothing was wrong and so there was no solution except to hold him and try to comfort him the best we could. I have anxiety that was worsened by postpartum and I started having daily panic attacks around the witching hour. I\u2019d know the crying was coming and I\u2019d have a total nervous breakdown on a daily basis. I\u2019d have to lock myself in my room and have hysterics for half an hour. After a week or so one day my husband came in and put his headphones over my ears and played music. He told me to see if muffling the cries a little helped. It did!!!! I would listen to the most soothing music I could (enya featured a lot) and even sway to the music. It helped keep me much calmer while I took care of my baby and I could still hear him, so I was still responding to him, it just lowered the volume and made it more manageable. It was a game changer! Literally a life saver. (Note: my husband also took care of the baby lots. We slept in shifts so the headphones were for the 4 hours where he got to sleep)", "Well now you have to share what noise cancelling headphones you have. Please", "Aww you guys are awesome!", "Aww so beautiful love the way you describe her", "This is fabulous\u2014I\u2019m glad you\u2019re working together to help each other through. This first part is such a slog (babies are fabulous but relentless I know) that whatever you can do to make it easier to deal that doesn\u2019t compromise the baby\u2019s care is great.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting your wife some help now\u2014it took me way too long to take all the steps to treat my PPD that I needed to make it better. Enjoy your little one!!", "Aww", "So is recommend looking into the loop ear plugs if you haven't already. They're specifically for toning down nose to a more bearable level.", "You know children respond to their parent's emotions. When you mention that when your wife uses the headphones, she is calmer and the baby calms faster, it seems like your wife is also going through somenkind and some level of anxiety.\nThat's why when your wife is feeling calmer, the baby calms sooner.\nPerhaps she has a few issues of her own which need to be dealt with.\nNTA", "Posts like this restore my faith in humanity. OP, the goodness of you and your wife really shines through in what you've written. Your daughter is lucky to have the two of you as parents. <3", "I\u2019m so happy that this was a case of your wife being tired and frustrated (as well as PPD possibly) and not her being ignorant.\n\nI understand her frustration. It\u2019s not the same thing at all, but a while ago I worked in a daycare. A family enrolled their daughter shortly after moving to America so that she could (hopefully) learn English quicker. I really wish they hadn\u2019t. She was only two, so she didn\u2019t understand why her parents were leaving, could not understand any of us (non of us spoke her language), and was inconsolable. Seriously she sobbed for almost the entire time she was there, pausing only if she happened to actually fall asleep during nap time. I was so worried that she would be dehydrated, so sad that I couldn\u2019t help her, and so frustrated by the end of the day.\n\nSeriously, my nerves were so frayed by the end of the day.", "Didn\u2019t see first post but applaud your solution. In fact my husband did something similar when our baby went into turbo demon mode. For some people crying banshee babies can be triggering. Having a solution where you can still care for your child appropriately is far superior than losing your temper with a baby.", "Lovely to hear!\n\nYou say you\u2019re not in a good place right now, but I disagree: you have talked through some important things and found some solutions together - as much as there\u2019s still work to be done, I\u2019d say you\u2019re in a really good place.", "Honestly, this is such a wonderful update.\n\nYour baby will be settling better as she's able to pick up on your moods. You relaxed more with the headphones, you were stressing without. Babies are... sponges. For negative and positive, in ways that, honestly are nigh unfathomable.\n\nIt's good to see you were both able to talk about everything and you're taking steps for everyones benefits. \n\nWe're all on the outside looking in, but I honestly don't think it was a bad thing to ask the Internet a hard question. Obviously some responses are polarising, but eventually the hive mind can come through. \n\nThe health worker might be able to refer your family to groups, solo or while unit. It's nice to see you're making the effort to be there more and free up more time for your wife to have support and potentially some time off here and there.", "I love this! Your little girl will grow up seeing that support needs being met is normal and healthy. And no doubt have her support needs met too. Sounds like you\u2019re both doing a great job supporting each other as well~", "J think you might be the most considerate person I've ever seen on this subreddit. Or even Reddit in general.", "I always think this needs to be told to all new parents. I have a massive stress reaction to baby cries and I didn\u2019t find out you could get ear defenders until after my kids were no longer babies! It would have been so much nicer if someone had just pointed me in the right direction!", "Or loop earplugs. They take the edge off the screaming", "Same same!\nThey individually realised the wife's remarks were out of character, and it helped uncover her possible post-partum depression, which they are working on, after bringing back the headphones for both of them.\n\nBlessings on this couple and their baby!\nAnd on their friend who wasn't afraid to speak up.", "Agreed! Our eldest was so bad with sleep (ADHD and asd...but obviously we didn'tknow) that 13 years later I still feel physically sick when a baby starts screaming :-(. It is genuinely a ptsd like symptom (I had ptsd, I am not exaggerating).\n\nPlease people, tell all new parents you know not to be afraid to get ear defenders!", "Mom with ADHD here\u2014noise canceling headphones are the only way I keep it together with a baby and a toddler.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t use them and falls apart after about three hours.", "I'm so happy read about a relationship where you support and communicate with each other \ud83e\udd70.\nIt sounds like you have a good relationship even though it's hard rigth now.", "Good job, dad.\n\nHaving a kid is hard and as women there are a lot more societal expectations placed on us - a lot of which we internalise - about our role as a mother. Somehow we are expected - or expect ourselves to be - wonder woman. While we're still fysically recovering from pregnancy and childbirth and our hormones are out of whack. It's a lot. Then to see others around us do well... it can be hard, making us feel even more of a failure. Why am I struggling when everyone around me loves it? Women have been having kids forever, so it shouldn't be this hard, right? What's wrong with me? I certainly have those feelings. And then my husband calls me supermom or tells me he's proud of me and it helps. Keep working together and keep telling her how you see her.

I wish your family all the happiness", "This is very heartwarming. I think your original post and this follow up could be shared with so many coming here to ask AITA.\n\nYou can read so many situations on here where people jump in with a judgment assigning fault on one side having only heard it from one point of view. Your wife came across as an arsehole in the OP, but is clearly an incredible person who made an understandable error in judgment and was also able to reflect on it regardless without intervention.\n\nThe love you all demonstrate for each other is so wholesome. This is nothing more than a speed bump. And this is your moment to be here for her in the same way she has been there for you so often. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already done countless times before too. \n\nAll the best OP, OP\u2019s wife and OP\u2019s child\u2026 you have a lovely little family!", "You're so sweet OP, thank you for the update.\n\nApparently blueberries are good for PPD.

It\u2019s amazing what good communication can do", "Wow, that original post was odd.\n\nNC headphones don't magically block out all noise, they just reduce the volume. You can still hear crying babies through them.\n\nIt's kind of like how sunglasses don't act like blindfolds, they just reduce glare from the sun.\n\nNice update though.", "I (well, we) use Sony WH-1000MX5 headphones. The price is eye-watering but they're the best I've come across. I've also got a pair of Peltor ear defenders which do a reasonable job but they're for hearing protection rather than noise cancelling. Then I've got Flare Calmer ear plugs, like the Loop ear plugs but I find they're better at reducing background noise like traffic and noisy shopping centres.", "Me too! I often roll my eyes a bit when people comment that they cried at a reddit post but there are actual drops on my cheeks and warmth in my heart for these people I've never met!", "Yeah me too.

Then why were my sleep patterns abnormal as a baby before I\u2019d even had solid food? \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how in hindsight neurodiverse symptoms show up in babies. My sister is BPD and in hindsight we can see how her neurodivergent symptoms were manifesting as a baby too. Like I don\u2019t think anyone should be diagnosing babies, but now that we\u2019re grown and diagnosed, my mom can see wet I didn\u2019t sleep well and why my sister cried so hard and so loud and so long (she had acid reflux and her little baby brain was even less equipped to handle the pain and emotion than a neurotypical baby.)\n\nI\u2019m sorry that\u2019s season wasn\u2019t so difficult for you and your family. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re all happy and healthy now.", "Good for you! I wish I had thought of the noise cancelling headphones too. Instead I have hearing loss on one side from so many nights of screaming and years of ful scream tantrums right into my ear.", "As a mother going thru PPD and anxiety right now as well, I completely felt her saying she felt like a bad mom and a failure. It\u2019s like logically I know I\u2019m not and my emotions say otherwise.

Why am I crying in work because an internet stranger loves his wife!?", "You've already had a good verdict. So, as an addition:\nMy second baby had lots of tummy issues, and it took a while to resolve them.

I'll check those out!", "OP OH MY GOODNESS!!! I\u2019m autistic as well and remember your first post and how helpful headphones can be to just quiet some of the noise.

Anywho, I just wanted to say that I love the way you speak about your family, I love the way your wife supports you, and I love the way you two communicated. Heck, I love that she decided to try out the headphones and that the whole thing has lead to you two seeking out help for her mental health.\n\nBasically, this entire update made my heart so happy.

I'm autistic like OP and I wish i'd had these (or even my autism diagnosis lol) when my son was little. But now I use them at work- if the lights are buzzing or the shredder is going or whatever. They're small enough that you dont LOOK like you have headphones on, so I can get away with them in a professional environment. I have the gold ones and the clear ones so they honestly just blend in, some people have thought they were earrings. Carrying them around changed my life.

And the \"mute\" add on REALLY does add a lot more noise restriction, highly recommend because you can take them in and out. \n\n(that said, if you want the mutes for cheaper, they have a 6 pack of just the mutes in different colors for 16 dollars, unfortunately not on amazon, but on the loop website, and if you can find a friend or five to split them with, that's way cheaper than getting the \"plus\" versions of the loops for ten dollars more that only includes two sets of mutes)", "Was straight up born an autistic insomniac lmao.

Our kid had colic, and my head would start spinning after so many hours of that baby screaming right in my ear.

That's awesome and really hard to do.

I saw some people in this discussion recommending various other ones so there's bound to be others out there.\n\nFor basic ear defenders I'd highly recommend anything by Peltor, they're more for hearing protection but they do a good job of dimming sounds to a tolerable level.\n\nFor something more discrete I use Flare Calmer ear plugs, they seem to work better for my ears than Loop ear plugs. They don't do much when my daughter is screaming at full volume but they're great for traffic and crowd noise and they help me when there's screaming and yelling kids having fun.", "We're so lucky, here in the UK we have a compulsory 2 or 4 weeks maternity leave, optional 2 weeks paternity leave and up to 1 year parental leave which can be split between both parents. I'm really looking forward to having that time with my daughter, so many dads I've talked to never get that opportunity.", "I wanted to check with her before discussing more of our home life with strangers on the internet but of course we both talk to friends and family for support and advice without needing permission.\n\nNo, no manipulation going on. It was a calm, open chat between best friends and partners about the struggles and fears we're facing. We've probably had to work on communication within the relationship far more than a neurotypical couple, our brains are entirely different so we literally wouldn't function together unless we had ways of understanding each other. Obviously in this situation it hasn't worked but we're learning from it. As for what happened, we know it's not OK but I also know how wildly out of character it is.

Can be regularly found on sale and are absolutely worth it. Reviews speak for themselves.", "While they aren't noise canceling, I'd also recommend Audio-Technia headphones. My son and I both have ASD, and attend a giant gaming convention (PAX west) every year, and after trying a couple brands, these are comfortable enough to be worn all day, and gently lower the volume enough to function in that environment, even without any music playing. The Loop earplugs are also amazing - they nestle in the ear and just lower the volume on everything.

She was criticizing him over something as inconsequential as headphones, and refused to back down even after he had proven that the headphones didn't hinder his ability to raise their daughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My wife hates it and has asked me to stop. She said that being a parent involves having to cope with the bad stuff, it's what we signed up for and that it's important not to block out her crying so I can feel what our daughter is feeling.\n\n2) According to this logic, an athlete should \"cope with the bad stuff\" of exercise by deciding not to drink water. Or a student should \"cope with the bad stuff\" of bullying by deciding to not to go to a teacher or the principal. A sentiment like this would be bad enough if OP was neurotypical, but the fact that she actively tried to pressure him into doing something that exacerbated his autism just makes it worse- especially when she had gone out of her way to accommodate said autism in the past.\n\n3) I find it concerning that the wife had to A) watch OP go through multiple meltdowns and B) learn that she had been called out by multiple people on the Internet before she changed her behavior and started working with OP to fix the problem. Whether her behavior stemmed from PPD or not, OP definitely deserves an apology.", "Our baby had a witching hour that my husband mostly handled - with noise canceling headphones.

As women, we are taught to minimize our own suffering in most instances. We are also taught, by example, that our complaints aren't often listened to. The one emotion I actually get listened to when I'm sharing is anger, and I have to be super amped up to be \"heard\" by those closest to me. So yes, you're right, but it is also YEARS of trained behavior working against her.\n\nHell, I was supporting a roommate for years and when I'd complain about him not even doing anything at home while I was off working he'd get shitty with me. Finally one day, with a smirk, he said \"this sounds like lots of jealousy coming from you\". I stopped in my tracks and said \"you're right. It is. I am jealous of the fact that I work a ton, make all the money, and still have to do everything at home cause your lazy ass won't do it\". I would say stuff to him. I'd ask him to do 1 chore while I was gone and it was never done. So all I could do was get angry to get heard. And then when I was angry and finally listened to, the response was that.\n\nI forgot to tie it all together before hitting send. I don't think she wanted him to suffer. I just think she wanted him to feel the same way she does, and in this instance, it was suffering. She was probably jealous he'd come up with something that helped and she probably felt like he was \"winning\". While I grasp that isn't healthy, these first few months of parenthood often don't bring out the best in anyone.", "I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you've got a good support network around you to help you through it.

My niece sniffed, calmly turned to my dad and said \"Grandad, I think she shit herself,\".
