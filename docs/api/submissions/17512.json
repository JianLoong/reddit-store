You're doing a brilliant job and please, please remember to look after yourself.\n\nThe first thing I have to address is my wife is not ableist, far from it. She's been an absolute rock for me through everything. Some examples are she; suggested I get diagnosed before we were even dating, encourages me to stim and indulge my special interests, despite wanting a big wedding she insisted we have a private official ceremony and a party after our honeymoon with scheduled rest breaks for me, she always checks in on me in all social situations and she even bought me the expensive noise-cancelling headphones. I don't deserve her but I'm grateful for her every single day. She's the best part of me.\n\nPerhaps because she's been nothing but supportive I automatically believed she was right about me caring for our daughter. But in this particular case she was in the wrong and has said so. She wasn't best pleased I'd asked strangers (I have her consent for this update) but understood why I did and had been thinking it over herself after seeing what it was doing to me. Turns out I wasn't anywhere near as good at hiding my meltdowns as I thought I was.\n\nAfter a lot of talking she said she felt angry and frustrated that (in her view) I was breezing through parenthood while she feels like she's drowning. What really hit me is when she said she feels like a bad mum and a failure. My amazing wife, the best mother I could ever imagine for our daughter, the woman with seemingly boundless love and care felt like she's failing as a mother. I wish she could see herself the way I see her just once. Part of me feels like I've failed her for not noticing how she was feeling, I think I was so caught up in my own joy that I missed her suffering.\n\nObviously we're not in a good place right now but we're going to talk to the health visitor about getting her the help she needs and what's available so she can get better but it sounds like PPD from what we've read. In the mean time I'm going to work from home 2-3 days a week once my manager has sorted the insurance out so she's not alone as much (the plan was for me to take the last 20 weeks of parental leave anyway), I'm going to book a session with my therapist, and the headphones are back. For both of us. She tried them a few days ago and said how much calmer and in control she felt, and how our daughter settles so much quicker. She's probably reading this and finding out that I've ordered her a pair and they'll be here Friday (if you are reading this, I love you).", "created_utc": 1684368934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kiw4b/aita_for_wearing_noise_cancelling_headphones_when/", "score": 333, "replies": ["[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bi2pc/aita_for_wearing_noise_cancelling_headphones_when/)", "That\u2019s a great update! Through your writing it\u2019s evident how much your family is made of love. Heartwarming :)", "I'm so happy, for all of you! \ud83d\udc96", "YTA", "That is the sweetest post ever...Goodluck....your baby girl is lucky to have you both", "This is the best update. In most situations in life there's no villain, just two people coming from different perspectives that probably just need to communicate some things, and I'm so glad you guys were able to.", "Thank you so much for this update! I like hearing these kinds of updates. I love hearing how supportive she has been throughout your relationship. I want to send her a virtual hug just so she knows she is not alone. I had PPD after both my babies. It is super hard especially when it seems like your partner is having such an easy time\u2026it will be easier over time especially when she gets help. I am glad you guys both decided she should get help. That is the healthiest thing for her. \u2764\ufe0f", "Wow.  The headphones sound brilliant, to be used while holding a crying baby.  Clever and well done.  To ignore crying baby would be awful, but you aren\u2019t, you are managing your stress quite cleverly.\n\nIn the terms of people saying silly things\u2026an elderly relative of mine picked up a baby, which cried. Relative said, \u201cit\u2019s my glasses, baby is scared\u201d.  But\u2026both both of baby\u2019s parents wore glasses.   So, that was nonsense.   Babies are used to what they see.  Yours has no idea what \u201chat\u201d you have on, and really doesn\u2019t care.  Baby can\u2019t see much more than your face, anyway.\n\nI hope your wife gets all the feedback and medical help that she needs.  I had PPD and even some psychosis. It really can suck.  Keep up the good work, she needs your support and help.", "The way you describe your wife and her mothering has me crying. You seem like a beautiful person", "You may have hit a bump in the road, but this internet stranger is wicked-impressed that you and your wife are so mature, thoughtful, and able to communicate.  This is a lovely update, and I hope the new headphones are a hit.  ya dun good.", "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Grateful for this update. Good luck to both of you!", "Good job redditors, and good job OP and wife!", "I'm glad your wife understands the benefits of you using the headphones. It really did sound unreasonable and illogical of her to have an issue with a coping mechanism that works well for you. \n\nI hope the headphones also help your wife and that she is able to enjoy this time with your daughter. It sounds like she has a supportive partner, and that is always helpful.", "Oh man, this made me cry. So lovely. You are lucky to have each other, and your daughter is lucky to have such a sweet and devoted mommy and daddy!", "This is such a lovely update, I hope some help from a therapist or an doc and more support from you can help decrease her PPD and help her see herself the way you do. Aw, good luck with the little one and the new headphones! :)", "I can understand why your wife feels like that. On top of doing all the physical labor (feeding, changing, bathing the baby, etc) she probably feels like she carries the full mental load. That's the counting of wet diapers, timing naps, feeding schedules, noticing patterns with gas, etc. IT'S A LOT. And I feel the dad's don't realize this. Her baby is alive, fed and clothed. She is being a good mom and glad she's getting help.", "> She's probably reading this\n\nOP, blink twice if you are safe", "I\u2019ve never read a post on Reddit that made me tear up with joy. Thank you and best wishes to you, your wife and your lucky daughter who will grow up in such a loving home.", "Really awesome! I'm glad she will have those headphones too because anything that keeps you calm, helps baby relax too. Good job getting her help too!", "Wholesome. As a fellow autistic person, this sub is very helpful and educational.", "Jumping on here to suggest maybe your wife could also get a pair of noise cancelling headphones.", "Nah seriously, I\u2019m actually welling up right now. All just a misunderstanding, solved by communication and mutual respect. They have so much love for each other and their little bundle, I hope things only improve for them. \u2764\ufe0f", "I thought I was the only one gettin\u2019 misty in here!", "he said at the bottom that he ordered her some!", "I hope they are in her favourite colour if possible. We have three pairs at home for our 2 boys (they grew out of the baby pair and needed new ones as they got older) and everytime their sister cried rhey would grab them and wear them, even found my 7M asleep with them on one night while 1F was teething. Every famiky member needs to find their own way to survive a crying baby and those head phones are awesome."]}
