And Robyn telling her friends about her feelings but not raising it with her family to avoid confrontation. \n\nHave you asked Robyn if she's ever told her sisters how she feels? She really needs to have that conversation sooner rather than later. Her annoyance will explode out of her. Or there will be more situations where her sister's don't want to be around her \"uptight friends who can't take a joke\" because they genuinely don't realise their existing joking dynamic upsets their sister.

Was out the night before the wedding  with my bridesmaid who should have really been my chief bridesmaid and spilled all my fears out. \n\nShe kept my sister in check for the whole ceremony. \n\nYour friend is blessed to have someone like you making sure that the day will be about her. Jokes like what the sister made are not okay. Let her feelings be hurt.", "NTA all the way. It sounds like something she needed to hear.", "NTA. I had to do this to my sisters friend AT the wedding, and it wasn\u2019t much better and it was only AFTER damage had been done. Better to get it out and clear now.", "NTA. You stood up for your friend in an unassuming way. I'm glad your friend appreciated your efforts, but nothing can change unless Robin starts to stand up for herself.", "NTA\n\nWhy do people think they should just ignore inappropriate comments because of someone's age? Quite frankly, you are defending it saying that it is a joke when you would have been completely within your boundaries as a friend to respond to that the way you did entirely straightfaced. I would just remind your friend that if there was ever a time to do what SHE wants, it is now. For HER day. So if she doesn't agree that this should just be a family thing, which she clearly decided originally that she does not, then she should say so and stick to her guns. She sounds like she needs a good friend like you to remind her that this day is all about her and her partner celebrating their love, and she can do whatever she needs to do to ensure that happens, including hurting this little drama queens feelings by reminding her that this won't be about her.", "NTA- The opinion of the couple matters more than their family. The bride appreciates what you did and you spoke the objective truth, so no problem. That the sisters got offended is very concerning.", "17 is old enough to know the wedding is about the COUPLE, not their siblings. SMH\n\nThe fact the extended family is upset at you for gently correcting her, shows how she got so entitled\n\nNTA", "\"Joke\"? Right.  You were right. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like their parents failed in their parenting with the 17 yr old. She sounds like such a spoiled brat.", "i genuinely have no idea how what she said could be a joke.. like what kind of joke even is that", "NTA. Continue to destroy that little runt with class. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb", "You sure she is 17 and not 3? Talk about overreacting. Boo hoo someone call the wambulance she was being snarky and you said something sarcastic to her. NTA.", "NTA It\u2019s absurd how offended she got by your one comment. Regardless of how said it said, whether it is a joke or not doesn\u2019t really matter because at the end lf the day, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Leaving u out of the weddings plans and etc is such a childish act. NTA.", "NTA It\u2019s absurd how offended she got by your one comment.

She needs allies in her life and her sisters are not. She needs you while her spine is growing, and if you are willing to be her backbone, stay and stick up for her. Someone should.", "NTA.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. The younger sister has just never heard it before and is bristling at being reminded that being the center of the universe is only her own delusion. \n\nRobin should use this opportunity to stand up for herself so that she\u2019s not Cinderella before the ball, at her own wedding.\n\nSeems because she\u2019s quiet and the middle kid, the other two are happy to treat her like she\u2019s not only invisible but unworthy of attention anyway.\n\nRobin should have her friends who see and adore her help lan the wedding, with her \u201cfamily\u201d appearing in minor walk on parts.", "NTA. Youngest sister sounds like a spoiled brat with main character syndrome: has to have all the attention on her. 17 is not \u201cjust a kid\u201d. She knew what she was saying and the family trying to defend her says a lot. It\u2019s up to the bride who she wants to help with the wedding and it sounds like her sisters are jealous that she chose you and not them.", "Thank you for standing up for your friend and I hope you continue too. NtA. Gawd can you just imagine how they will be of she decides to have children. Also hope her fiance stands up for her as well.", "YTA \n>'I think your sisters wedding will be about her, not you.  I definitely meant this as a joke\n\nThis was not a joke, nor was it intended to be a joke.  Own it if you said it, don't backtrack or hide behind the 'joke'.", "I just got married, and had similar issues with my sisters. One being 18. She made my whole rehearsal and set up about trying to get me to kick her out, because she had a party. So she was a major bitch to everyone, antagonizing people, would never stop talking until I told her to leave in not nice words. I had been hinting and suggesting she go get ready for her party for hours. (I had told her before she didn't need to come if she was going to be miserable, after having tried be nice the week before saying she could go to her party) \n\nMy other sister wanted an all green bridal party. I don't like green. I was letting all the bridesmaids pick their own dresses, including color, so if they wanted green, they could wear it. Then after my months of no one picking anything, I assigned everyone a color. Gave that sister green. She wanted to wear red then and was mad our mom claimed red.. \n\nMy other sister didn't take the day off before my wedding, and worked 11a to 11p, do we had to do the actual rehearsal in the morning on Saturday. This sister is a nurse, she knew over a year in advance. She works 3 12s a week. So she could have still worked a full week with that Friday off. She then complained the next day about how tired she was all day. \n\nI am the oldest, and I was always the one that compromised growing up. \n\nAlso my MIL flew in at 4am the morning of with no arrangements, waking best man to come get her 2 hours away.\n\nI ended up having a good wedding, I like my pictures, and how all the bridesmaids are in their own styles. My parents played interference a lot with my sisters, reminding them this was my day, and I always do whatever I can for them.\n\nHaving a support is good, you may need to eat a little crow for the sake of your friend, but she will appreciate having someone in her corner.", "Sounds like the kind of sister who would have her bf \"propose\" at the wedding to draw attention to herself. Keep an eye out for that shit", "Imagine the type of person that gets offended by the expectation that their own sister's wedding day be more about the sister than herself. \n\nThat amount of main character syndrome is borderline sociopathic.", "It's very telling, isn't it? If saying terrible things as a joke is so cool, they should all be happily laughing off OP's response. But their response gives away how completely bullshit \"it's just a joke\" is as an excuse.", "Exactly!!!  If the bride is the one doing all the planning then the BRIDE chooses who helps and who doesn't, not even the groom gets a say, (especially) if he left it to her.", "Great post.", "Sounds to me like this is the epitome of the older, younger, middle child dynamic\u2026. Robin is so accustomed to having to give way that it\u2019s hard to stand up for herself. Younger is the \u201cbaby\u201d, who gets away with a lot.", "If the sister\u2019s comment was a joke like she claimed, then OPs comment is also a joke.\n\nThe only difference is who the joke is directed at.\n\nIf the sister\u2019s comment was serious, like we all suspect it was, then so was OP\u2019s and they should own it.\n\nI would have replied \u201cmy comment is the same amount of joke as your comment.\u201d", "This has narc vibes. Narcs have an instinct for making other people\u2019s events about them.", "There is no way to stand up to people like this effectively. You did good.", "Of course the family thinks you're an ah, you might empower their favorite punching bag.  How dare you ruin their Cinderella story, they've always wanted to play the wicked (step)sisters! /s", "I really hope you continue to be there for your friend and support her since it sounds like her family is ready to descend on this wedding so they can make it all about them. I really hope Robin and her partner can pay for the whole thing themselves and that way they can tell everyone who doesn't like their ideas to go pound sand.\n\nHonestly, I really hope Robin finds a way to put the fear of God in them about this wedding being about her and her partner, and if her sisters have any ideas about grabbing the mic for an impromptu speech or having their bf propose to them during her first dance, she'll have them kicked out. NTA", "You're doing good, OP. Your job here is to help your friend -- not her family -- with wedding planning, with emotional support, with dealing with problems, whatever comes up. Her family doesn't matter here. They can be irritated all they want and demand whatever, but it is your friend's wedding and SHE decides. Pay the family no mind unless your friend is telling you to back off. \n\nLittle sis was obviously the spoiled baby of the family if her behavior has gone unchecked and enabled like this.", "OMG, I definitely hope she doesn't get bullied into that. It'll ensure the wedding is about the precious MOHs and not the bride!", "Yeah, OP should have a heart to heart with Robin about how she can support her and help enforce boundaries with family. So long as you have Robin's go ahead, who cares what the rest think. As you said, the day is about her.", "And they always make MY drug use all about them", "She\u2019s 17. Teenagers are self obsessed by nature. Give her a break. It\u2019s the family that\u2019s blowing this out of proportion", "In my experience this is just dumb teenager behavior, nothing more.", "Also suggest to Robin she use passwords with her vendors!!", "Dude as someone who was a 17 year old girl, you don't get upset at someone joking back at you that someone else's wedding ain't about you. You also don't make demands that that person isn't involved in helping plan a wedding that ain't about you and get other family members pissed at that person.", "Just because *you* were a horrible, selfish teen, it doesn't mean we ALL were.", "By teens I hope you mean thirTEEN or fourTEEN.", "I've known teenagers to do a lot of dumb shit, but this isn't just dumb teen behavior. This is entitled behavior.", "Yeah that makes sense & was tactful, hitting the right note--it is important to not make that Serious Talk face till it's needed. Clearly someone needs to make it to this young lady and give her a real lecture but you probably don't have standing to do it and her parents apparently won't... more's the pity.", "You're nicer than me.  I would've went with \"aww sweetie you must be confused! Weddings are about the bride and groom.  Is there anything else I can help clear up?\" With a big smile the whole time.  17 is old enough to know how things like weddings work.  Sounds like she's used to starting shit but not enough people have given it back yet.", "Perhaps \"quip\" would be a better term... \ud83e\udd14\n\nRegardless, NTA.  And good an you for sticking up for your friend.", "Yeah, entitled teen behavior, that\u2019s how a lot of them are. It\u2019s not fucking narc behavior."]}
