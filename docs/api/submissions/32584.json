Her partner (24M) asked me for some help with setting up the proposal and the whole thing was lovely. Since then they have been having a look at Pinterest for colour schemes and venues, but no actual planning yet.\n\nFor a little background on Robins' sisters (17f and 25f), they can be a little much.  Robin has always been the quietest one of the 3 and while she get's along fine with them, I wouldn't say they're super close. Her sisters can sometimes say or do things that are a little out of line, and they just expect Robin to accept it and not say anything. I have met the younger sister before, and she does seem to expect things to go her own way.\n\nNow my husband and I were at Robin's house a few days after their engagement and her younger sister stopped by quickly with her boyfriend. She was talking about the wedding and said something along the lines of 'well we all know it's mostly going to be about me anyway'. She said it quite straight faced and while I figured she was probably joking, I knew she'd made comments like this in the past that had upset Robin. So I said back 'I think your sisters wedding will be about her, not you.' I definitely meant this as a joke, and thought I had used a joking tone. She left shortly after.\n\nI've since found out she was quite angry at my comment, and has told her mum and oldest sister. Robin knows it was a joke, and has said she actually appreciated me standing up for her. Her sisters however now don't want me involved in any aspect of the wedding planning, and have said it should 'really be a family thing anyway.' Some of her other family have commented I was harsh and that she's 'just a kid.' In my eyes, it was intended as a joke but also I think 17 is old enough to know what may be an inappropriate thing to say, and understand that her comment hurt her sisters feelings. I'm starting to feel bad though, so AITA?

Boo hoo. Your friend has probably been dealing with this for years. Hopefully the younger sister doesn\u2019t try to get engaged or pregnant in order to announce it at your friends wedding. Tbh your friend needs to stand up for herself in front of her family before younger sister tanks her day", "Well, if her statement was a joke, so was yours.\n\nAs hers really wasn't, neither was yours, but she has no excuse for her obviously ridiculous statement.\n\nNTA either way. Be as involved as your friend--the bride--wants you to be. Everyone else can and should piss off.", "kinda 'fafo' situation.  \nRobin sis like to 'push some buttons' for fun, but, surprised pikachu face, didn't like the slap on the wrist when the wrong button are pushed at the wrong time and place.  \n\n\nNTA  \n\n\nRobin is happy that at least HER FRIEND stands for her against her sis BS(and i fell that Robin SO is glad too), so both her sis and her family siding  with them can kick rocks", "NTA and as you said it\u2019s your friend\u2019s day. She can choose who helps her", ">I definitely meant this as a joke.\n\nCome on, you didn\u2019t. \n\nYou keep saying the word \u2018joke\u2019 but it\u2019s not one. Just own it\u2026it\u2019s a true statement of fact. \n\nSad thing is, I\u2019ll bet you a tenner your friend bends to her sisters and limits your involvement. \n\nNTA, but don\u2019t walk it back by claiming it\u2019s a joke", "NTA. Younger sister needed to hear this because\u2026true!", "The 17 year old sister. Knows her sister well and said it for a reason. You stay in the wedding planning. And please convince your friend to stand up for herself or her boyfriend", "Nta. They only don\u2019t want you involved because you have a backbone and won\u2019t let them destroy your friend\u2019s day without a fight. Hopefully your friend makes you the maid of honor instead of caving, so you can beat off the sisters and mother with a stick when they try to take over everything.", "It shouldn\u2019t have been a joke, it\u2019s reality. The wedding is an about your friend. NTA", "NTA - You made a lighthearted comment to protect your friend, and while her sister may not have liked it, your intentions were to support Robin during what should be a special time for her.", "NTA but if you\u2019re honest it wasn\u2019t a joke it was an attempt to put her in her place. The only problem is that the bride her sister is the only one that can actually do that. If she doesn\u2019t develop a spine and stand up for herself and you then most likely it will be all about the youngest one. If she allows them to walk all over her then that\u2019s on her.", "NTA.\nYour friend needs a master class in standing up for herself, but having a friend do it for her is also pretty good.\nRobin's wedding will not be about her sister in any way. She can be upset about that if she wants but she NEEDS to know that the world does not begin and end with her.\nIt doesn't matter what her sisters want. If the BRIDE wants you involved in planning, then be involved in planning. Honestly it sounds like both sisters need to take a well-deserved backseat to remind them of their role as sisters, not main characters. A 17 year old is old enough to know better. She's a kid but she's not a child.\n\nDon't feel bad. You did it nicely where some people wouldn't. She got off easy as far as I'm concerned.", "To be honest, this is really hard to judge because no one, not even you, truly knows the dynamics between these sisters. As someone with sisters, I could totally see myself saying this as a joke, and being completely taken aback when my sister's friends jumped down my throat for it. \n\nI could also see these jokes being something that really annoy Robyn because of her existing resentment at feeling overlooked by her family at prior events. And Robyn telling her friends about her feelings but not raising it with her family to avoid confrontation. \n\nHave you asked Robyn if she's ever told her sisters how she feels? She really needs to have that conversation sooner rather than later. Her annoyance will explode out of her. Or there will be more situations where her sister's don't want to be around her \"uptight friends who can't take a joke\" because they genuinely don't realise their existing joking dynamic upsets their sister. And they don't know their sister feels overlooked in the family. NAH", "NTA but if your friend won't stand up for herself then there's little you can do. She needs to grow a spine but it seems unlikely at this point.", "NTA but only because Robin appreciated your involvement. People's family dynamics are complicated and generally you should stay out unless you're very certain your interference is desired.", "1.)  The sister wasn't joking.\n\n2.) Neither were you.\n\n3.) The family's reaction would explain how the sister got that way.\n\n4.) Who plans and is involved in the wedding is up to Robin, not the folks who think it's just swell when her sisters stomp on her joy.\n\n5.) Robin is grateful you stood up for her, so clearly she was very much aware that there was no joking going on, her feelings were hurt, and she experienced you as having her back.  Good for you!\n\nNTA", "Nta saying that a wedding is about the bride shouldn\u2019t be controversial. Sounds like your friend should look into eloping.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your friend has a terrible family, this type of nonsense should have been nipped in the bud long, long ago.", "NTA. She is definitely used to getting away with this kind of comments. You protected your friend and are probably the only one who cares enough about her not to enable this behavior. :)", "17 is not \"just a kid\". She's nearly an adult and should know better. She's selfish and self centred and needs yo learn the world doesn't revolve around her. I wouldn't have even said what you said as a joke but completely blunt and harsh because I have no time for people like that. \n\nThe family also have no right in deciding who has a part in planning, that's down to your friend. NTA, 100%, but the family who take the side of a 17 year old brat who enable her to bully her sister definitely are.", "NTA.  Corralling overzealous or overly demanding family members and guests is the responsibility of the maid of honor and best man.  That takes the stress off of the bride so she can enjoy not just her wedding but the fun parts of planning it.  Hopefully she will pick you as the MoH, or at least a bride\u2019s maid.", "Nta you simply made a statement of fact", "Nta", "You are a wonderful friend. Wish I had someone like you in my corner.", "Esh only because you're lying - it wasn't a joke and you know it.  Sister is ridiculous, old enough to know better and deserved it.  Own your position, why are you hiding behind it's a joke?  That's passive aggressive bs.", "Make sure lil sis stfu and not try wear white/wedding colors/attire. And of course she runs to mummy smh", "They don't want you involved because she intends to make it all about her. You speaking up shows you can not be steam rolled into anything so she is getting you out now.", "It\u2019s not even worth worrying about. They\u2019ll either get over their imaginary slight or they won\u2019t / that\u2019s their problem. Aside from the wedding I\u2019d imagine you might only see them once a blue moon", "NTA at all!! I hope Robin goes NC with her awful GC sister(s) after the wedding (or before, tbh)!", "NTA. If that\u2019s a joke, it was in poor taste and it wasn\u2019t funny. Good thing it doesn\u2019t matter what they think about who should be involved in planning since it\u2019s NOT ABOUT THEM.", "She\u2019s definitely been getting better at standing up for herself the past few years, but I think she does struggle sometimes still", "I think I said in another comment, maybe \u2018joke\u2019 was the wrong word. I definitely intended it to have a sarcastic edge so it didn\u2019t come across as me just scolding her", "This is a fair comment. I think I was so quick to defend Robin because I knew there was a big chance it would upset her. As far as I\u2019m aware, her sisters know how she feels about this stuff but they push back by saying they \u2018don\u2019t mean\u2019 to upset her or overrule her decisions", "You are so right. My sister and I bicker like crazy, but if anyone looks at her sideways (including my best friends) I\u2019m not having it. OP is nta for standing up for her friend but she may be the one who gets ousted in this situation. Sisters are complicated. And one thing you never do, is get in between them.", "I don\u2019t think she would be opposed to the idea too much because she\u2019s mentioned being nervous having to say vows in front of lots of people. Her partner though has a very large and much more easy going family that he wants to come. He\u2019s part of a culture that typically has quite large weddings too", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s decided on the MOH yet but I know her sisters were trying to get her to make them \u2018joint MOH\u2019 and she is definitely not for it \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s fair, I had definitely intended it more as sarcasm but I understand this stance", "So the bride appreciates you standing up for her and of course her sisters don\u2019t want you planning the wedding and interfering with making it about them. Stand by your friends side and help her keep her backbone. She needs you", "Maybe you mean you said it spontaneously and lightly, not making a big deal of it. You were quite right to shut that nonsense down fast - well done. The sister sounds like a brat. At 17, there is no excuse for that nonsense. Seriously, a six\\_year\\_old would be told off for saying that. Maybe she thought she was joking when she said it, but it's still nasty given the power dynamic in that family.", "With family like that your friend would be best off eloping and spending the money on an amazing honeymoon. It sounds like they won't be satisfied until she's miserable at her own wedding. NTA.", "NTA. Many a true word is said in jest.......", "My advice would be to wait for Robyn to develop a backbone and stick up for herself, and then have her back by supporting what she's saying. \n\nBecause look what's happening now. Her family don't want you involved in her wedding, and Robyn's probably going to go along with what they want. You had someone's back who doesn't have the capacity to have your back, because she hasn't developed the skill of sticking up for herself.", "Yeah, exactly. Me and my sister had a fight and didn't speak for 6 months one time, I saw her on a night out and checked she was safe and had taxi money. Didn't talk again for another 2 months. \n\nEven if you friend vents to you, you don't get in-between sisters. If you have to get involved, wait for your friend to stand up for herself and support what she's saying.", "Maybe do both? Small elopement and then big party. It\u2019s just upsetting to know that her wedding planning will be like pulling teeth for her if she needs to fight her sisters. \n\nCan you, her, her husband and anyone else whose her support have like a team meeting and start discussing a plan on how to handle her sisters and mom? I assume her parents don\u2019t have her back if this is the relationship. I think she\u2019ll need extra support to stand up for herself in this high stress situation", "Ah thank you, I couldn\u2019t describe what I meant properly! It was this, I tried to say it in a lighthearted way so I didn\u2019t seem like I was just telling her off", "This is kind of why I didn't get married. Everytime I mentioned it, my Mum and my sister railroaded in making it all about themselves and making sure I didn't \"shame\" the family with inappropiate choices. I get the same vibes about this one. It will be all her sisters' tastes and little of her own. I hope OP remains involved so as to help her break out of their control.", "For sure! My sister and I had a HUGE fight in front of my best friend and she was like \u201cI\u2019ll just wait till you guys are done, nobody drag me in this.\u201d Smart. She got us though. She is family and would never take sides or talk down to my sister, she\u2019s like a third sister. But my sister is my sister. There\u2019s this connection that is like nothing else.", "This is a good idea, I will definitely suggest this to them both. Their dad tries not to get involved in \u2018drama\u2019 and their mum is definitely on the little sisters side always, because that\u2019s her \u2018baby\u2019"]}
