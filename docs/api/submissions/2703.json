Instead it was a picture of my youngest crying and a caption that said \u201cshe fell and hit her head on the tub\u201d.  Thinking that while she was crying, she ultimately was fine since I don\u2019t get a call or text, I sent a Snapchat text (7:05 PM) saying \u201cAwe baby girl\u201d, and then sent a photo of me saying goodnight.  She snapped me back right after saying \u201cYa not good\u201d.  I then am sent a video (7:10 PM) of the girls saying goodnight and I went back to enjoying talking with friends.\n\nAt 8:24 PM I see my wife had sent a text at 7:15 PM asking if she should be worried about a concussion, and then at 8:14 PM she said \u201cYou\u2019re on (1 year old daughters name) duty the whole night when you get home\u201d.\n\nI replied asking \u201cWhy?\u201d followed by \u201cWhat is she doing that I need to be on duty for?\u201d  I didn\u2019t get a reply so asked \u201cHello?\u201d At 8:50 PM.\n\nWhen I got home around 9:45 PM my wife was sleeping and I woke up to tell her I was home and she was pissed.  I asked what she was upset about and she is furious I didn\u2019t ask to see how our daughter was doing.  I replied saying I wasn\u2019t here, have no way to judge from a blurry pic how hurt she is, and didn\u2019t get a call or anything alerting me to any concern.  We snapped our good nights and I put the phone away.  When I finally saw then text an hour after, I asked what was up and nothing.  \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1668832370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yz3jyo/aita_for_not_asking_how_our_daughter_is_doing/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People are asking why you didn\u2019t drop what you\u2019re doing and call, but if your wife was actually concerned she was really hurt, *why would she stop what she\u2019s doing to grab her phone to take a photo of your crying child to send you a Snapchat instead of trying to help your injured child*???\n\n\u201cOh no baby girl bumped her head and is crying! Let me send a Snapchat before comforting my child that\u2019s in pain!\u201d What the actual fuck is wrong with people?\n\nI probably wouldn\u2019t take it that seriously either, since kid\u2019s obviously not hurt enough to warrant an actual phone call. *Snapchat?* Come on.

You are at an event.  Your wife should have told you it was serious.  You aren't a mind reader and kids get bumps all the time.  Your wife is overreacting and probably jealous you were out and not at home, it's very common behavior.", "NTA. Using snapchat to send a captioned photo of a crying child doesn't indicate any kind of urgency.

There's a decent chance I would have called to check, but the Snapchat bit is really throwing me off. \n\nThe reason your wife sucks in this situation is her really bizarre way of communicating about a situation she was clearly feeling vulnerable about.\n\nThe reason you suck, is that at 8:24 you saw two messages implying that your wife had much more serious concerns about your daughter **and you still got home over an hour later???**\n\nThat is bananas. You two need to get your act together and do better about communication.", "ESH\n\nIf your wife was genuinely worried, she could and should have called you and asked you to come home, not sent a Snapchat with no other context.\n\nOnce you knew your wife was worried, you should have taken it a bit more seriously instead of just brushing it off.", "NTA\n\nSnapchat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an emergency.
