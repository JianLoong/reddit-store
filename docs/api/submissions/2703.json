Instead it was a picture of my youngest crying and a caption that said \u201cshe fell and hit her head on the tub\u201d.  Thinking that while she was crying, she ultimately was fine since I don\u2019t get a call or text, I sent a Snapchat text (7:05 PM) saying \u201cAwe baby girl\u201d, and then sent a photo of me saying goodnight.  She snapped me back right after saying \u201cYa not good\u201d.  I then am sent a video (7:10 PM) of the girls saying goodnight and I went back to enjoying talking with friends.\n\nAt 8:24 PM I see my wife had sent a text at 7:15 PM asking if she should be worried about a concussion, and then at 8:14 PM she said \u201cYou\u2019re on (1 year old daughters name) duty the whole night when you get home\u201d.\n\nI replied asking \u201cWhy?\u201d followed by \u201cWhat is she doing that I need to be on duty for?\u201d  I didn\u2019t get a reply so asked \u201cHello?\u201d At 8:50 PM.\n\nWhen I got home around 9:45 PM my wife was sleeping and I woke up to tell her I was home and she was pissed.  I asked what she was upset about and she is furious I didn\u2019t ask to see how our daughter was doing.  I replied saying I wasn\u2019t here, have no way to judge from a blurry pic how hurt she is, and didn\u2019t get a call or anything alerting me to any concern.  We snapped our good nights and I put the phone away.

Sounds looks she had a tough night (crying kids suck even if the bumps are minor) and wanted an \u201cAdda girl\u201d and a \u201cthanks for doing all this so I could enjoy a night with friends, you should call _____  and do something with them next week\u201d from you. It can be hard for moms to ask for a night off. Mom guilt is real and can easily make you feel like you are a bad mom for asking for a kid free night. But that doesn\u2019t excuse the poor communication here. I just wanted you to have an idea of where she might be coming from. Have a convo with her. But also let her know trying to imply your kids have serious head injuries is not ok. Ive pulled similar stunts, but they\u2019ve always been diaper blow outs or food thrown everywhere in a tantrum.\n\nNTA.", "I don\u2019t understand married people communicating on Snapchat and feel very old now.", "Also how worried was she actually about the child having a concussion, if she was *asleep* by the time he got home? Had that child been seriously hurt and a concussion a possibility, I would hope that she would have gotten her to an urgent care for a check or *at a minimum* observe her closely - because if you suspect a concussion, you are not supposed to let them sleep.", "Imagine hurting yourself and your husband taking a picture of you while you are crying. And this being a natural response. I genuinely am so concerned for some kids out there", "I 100% agree. I think she was pissy cause he was out with friends/coworkers having a good time while she was at home. She did this to get him to come home immediately.", "Agreed 100%. Kids hurt themselves all the time. I think mom was pissed dad was out enjoying himself and picked a fight. NTA", "Agreed, which is how I have always viewed it.  So if it\u2019s on Snapchat I assume it\u2019s all good.  I wouldn\u2019t Snapchat the fire department if my house was burning down.", "She had all weeks notice, had them from daycare pick up until bedtime so about 3 hours.", "We talk.  Snapchat is a quick check in or sharing something insignificant and not serious.  At least that is how I have always viewed it.  Like I said to her this morning, once you view it you have only so much time to reply it so a text with the photo would have been way better if she wanted me to analyze this without interrupting the night.  \n\nOnce it was gone and the goodnights took place, I assumed things were just fine, put my phone in my pocket and visited.", "This. NTA", "Actually you should let them sleep if they want to. You can just wake them up every now and then (although some sources say that isn\u2019t necessarily needed either). Sleep is good in helping heal your brain", "Yeah cuz it's totally not serious if it's a Snapchat. If there's a serious injury you're getting a phone call.\n\nIt kind of matters that you're meetups are fewer than hers, has she made drama before when she has to stay home and take care of the kids? Does she get jealous that you're out and she's not?\n\nMaybe you two should talk about having only emergency contact on nights when you're out socializing with other adults.", "Are you a nurse/ doc/ paramedic / EMT / radiology?\nDo you have qualifications related to assessing injury severity or assessing head injury that mom does not?", "Totally agree! I have four children, 16 to 27.  I don't have a picture before the age of six or so without a bruise or a bump somewhere. I remember the first time I got the same advice, along with \"they bounce.  Gotta let them explore to learn their environment and themselves\". Old pediatrician, solid advice.", "Wow - I had no idea. I still had drilled in my mind the \u201cdon\u2019t let them sleep\u201d if you suspect head injury.\n\nAs a minimum *I* would not have slept if I had suspected that my 2 years old has a serious injury; so I still doubt that the mom was really concerned.", "From the sounds of it this morning, she was upset when I shared at 4:30 that I likely would miss bedtime at 7.  I work until 5, takes about a half hour to get to town, and then add on other people showing up for an event scheduled for me by former coworkers and friends.  I can\u2019t really duck out as people were arriving.\n\nShe said she rushed home for her last event and as I shared that was her decision.  I didn\u2019t have a timeline for her, she self imposed it on herself.", "Not sure why you were downvoted but I agree.  There is more underneath this.", "NTA.  My son had a seizure at preschool.  It was his first one ever.  The school called and I flew out of the office.  The entire 45 min drive I was out of my mind worried.\n\nI didn't text my husband,  I called his cell over and over and over until he finally picked up.  He left it at his desk and was in a meeting.  I TOLD him what happened and to meet me at the hospital.\n\nIf it is urgent, you don't send pics and texts.  You call over and over until your partner picks up", "NTA. If there was a real problem, why was mommy taking photos to send to you? Why wasn't there a phone call or a text indicating an emergency?\n\nMy ex used to pull crap like this, only pre-cellphone era. He would call my job when I had to work my two Saturdays a month with nonsense. Where are the extra diapers? Where are the bandaids? Do we have any peanut butter?", "Why TF are grown ass, married parents with small children communicating about said children through snapchat? Lmfao \n\n\nESH - you could have just added a simple \"She seem ok?\" To the end of your reply, and your wife for sending you a fucking snapchat instead of comforting/evaluating your hurting child before informing you of what happened and her care status.", "ESH. Your wife for not communicating and you for not calling when she said \"how do I know if she has a concussion?\"\n\nJust take a 2 minute call to verbally check in and manage everyone's expectations", "NTA. The parent that is there at the moment needs to deal with it. And if they need a second opinion, snap chatting the parent who\u2019s drinking with coworkers in a bar a picture of a crying child isn\u2019t really going to help", "NTA If your wife was so concerned she should have put her phone down and stopped sending snap chats and instead she should have taken your child to the doctor. It obviously wasn\u2019t an emergency if she was using snap chat. What kind of parent thinks to themselves, let me snap chat this if your child is actually hurt? Kids hit their heads all the time and the high majority of the time it isn\u2019t serious. If your wife thought it was actually serious and was sending snap chats instead of getting help, she\u2019s the AH, big time.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s upset that you were out having a good time while she was home dealing with kids. If she was genuinely worried about a concussion both her and the daughter wouldn\u2019t have been asleep. She would\u2019ve kept her up to make sure everything was alright. Tell your wife to plan herself a girls night out and you will be home with the kids.", "NTA. Your wife was trying to ruin your evening and it didn't succeed. You need to have a conversation with her about communication and her FOMO (fear of missing out.)", "NTA. If your wife was worried, she\u2019d have called instead of sending a nebulous Snapchat. Maybe you two need to talk about channels of communication, and establish what method when.", "NTA. \nbut I suspect this has more resentment in it than being angry you didn\u2019t check on how the child was doing. \n\nAs a woman who lets her annoyances get the best of her at times. And a mother who is home alone with her kids A LOT. I can see this situation being based more on the fact that your wife was home, dealing with a difficult situation and you weren\u2019t there to help. You instead were out enjoying yourself. \n\nWith that being said. As somebody who takes it out on her husband (and knows it\u2019s wrong and is working on communicating better) I can say she is possibly using the hit on the head situation as an excuse to be angry towards you without out trying to tell you to come home when she is struggling. No mother wants to admit she can\u2019t handle situations herself. But we do need help at times. And when it builds up\u2026 we snap and can become petty and aggressive. Again. I\u2019m not saying her behavior was okay. It\u2019s not. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong by not checking in. In a normal situation, she should have called if it was a big problem. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I would just suggest discussing the root of her frustrations.", "NTA. Snapchat is not how you ask for help in a possible emergency. She could have called and spoke her concerns, or mention them period. \u201cI think she may be concussed, can you come help?\u201d Would have been a great line.", "NTA snap chat isn't for emergencies, it's for fun. If she was truly concerned she should've called you or a nearby clinic to ask if she should bring in the kid or not.", "My husband and I solely communicate via Snapchat. He's the only person I talk to on there. I guess I prefer it so his notifications don't get lost in the flurry of emails, texts, other notifications I get on my phone. \nIf I had a serious issue though, I'd just call him. But using Snapchat to communicate doesn't seem that weird to me. Falling asleep while proclaiming hubby needs to be on daughter-duty all night doesn't really make sense to me though", "This! The whole situation just plays out as weird. The lack of communication between them is puzzling. \n\nWhy she didn't call him, if she was truly worried, doesn't make any sense.\n\nWhy after he finally saw that she wascworried, but still didn't come home right away or at least call her, bothers me.\n\nThe whole thing just makes me go, huh! \ud83e\udd14", "I don't understand anyone in a committed relationship using snapchat after the things I've heard about it lol", "That used to be what we were told, but now it's let them sleep and just wake them up every now and then.", "I think ESH. Your wife didn't convey much of a sense of urgency by sending a picture with a caption, but when she said your daughter hit her head you could've checked in with an \"is she okay?\" You and your wife could've gone from there. \n\nShe could've avoided this by expressing her concern through a less-passive medium, and you could've made sure things were managed before returning to your evening.", "I don\u2019t get it. My husband sent me a picture of his hand. He said he hit while working. I called and found out if he was ok.   My sister sent me a picture of my great niece crying I called her to make sure she was ok.   Maybe I\u2019m just old school.", "My niece loves to Snapchat me about her day. I get about 5-10 snaps a day showing me what she\u2019s doing and we communicate back and forth.  Snapchat (like anything) can be used in bad ways but it can also be used for us adults to communicate when our younger family in ways they appreciate", "I just don't think snapchat is a safe platform for younger people either, picture texts are a thing \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I know that it's not ONLY used to be dirty lol I just don't support children being on the platform, or understand the interest in it from whole ass grown adults. I'm not saying everyone using it is doing bad things but I think the whole disappearing message thing is kinda sketchy and leaves way too much room for inappropriate activity. And its just super weird to me that it would be a committed couple's primary or often used form of communication.", "ESH\n\nWhile I get that if I had been sent a snapchat pic of my daughter crying, I would think it wasn't to bad of an issue, and that things were being handled. I still would have asked how she was doing, and maybe checked in a time or two later just to make sure she was ok. \n\nBut that is me a worried mom. Unless my SO said otherwise I would have stayed out with my friends too. Or at least asked if I was needed at home. But again that is just me. \n\nIf your wife wanted you home she should have said so, that would be on her. But it is on you for not at least asking after your child to see how she was doing. \n\nBut again like I said I would have checked in and asked about the child. That does not mean everyone is like me though", "NTA bumps on the head are extremely common in toddlers and snapchat hardly lends itself to a feeling of seriousness. I wouldn't have been concerned either.", "NTA \n\nSounds like wife was mad you were out having fun while she was at home so she's trying to play the victim. You don't use snapchat for emergencies.", "Nta if it was a real emergency, why was she snap chatting you, I find that silly and i use Snapchat a lot. No phone call, no text messages, just a few snaps that you might not even have opened.", "Lmao Snapchatting each other. If your wife was concerned, she would\u2019ve called/FaceTimed you. Not fucking Snapchat. You guys sound so young. NTA but courtesy \u2018oh no is everything alright?\u2019 would\u2019ve been nice.", "NTA if she was worried she should have said something", "Nta snapchat is not the way to communicate if there is an issue and you are needed at home. That is what picking the phone up and calling you is for. Using an app to send you a video of your daughter crying was just to ruin your night and make you come home faster.", "NTA. It seems to me like your wife was just mad you were having a night out while she was home.", "NTA. If your wife was serious concerned, it should NOT have been communicated via Snapchat; she should have called.", "ETA your kids deserve better parents than they got. Your wife takes photo of a hurt child to shame you. You rather drank that ask about your kids. I can see those kids running away from both of you as soon as they get old enough to pack a suitcase.", "So your failure was in not following along with the obvious manipulation tactics of your wife.\n\nIf your daughter was seriously injured she would have called explaining they were on their way to the emergency room and either you need to get home to watch the other kids or to meet them at the hospital, which I'm sure you would have.\n\nNo so this was a situation where your wife was thinking about this slip and her emotions were playing through scenarios and she was feeling guilty.  So she then starts to weave in her frustration that she's now feeling guilty because you weren't home to blame so now she's getting even more spun up.  I'm probably not exactly right about this, but I'm probably also not too far off.\n\nSo then with all this back story, made up drama in her head she sends you the Snap.  There's of course no clear thinking that you aren't privy to any of her emotional fantasy world but because you don't run to the rescue she finally has what she wanted.  A place to assign the blame for your daughter getting hurt on her watch.\n\nThis is very sadly very common toxic femininity.\n\nSo the best way to handle this is to stay grounded in reality.  Don't waste any time apologizing for or playing the Snap Chat didn't respond in time game.  Focus on the steps leading up to accident, what mistakes can be avoided in the future, emphasize the elements that were accidental and you don't blame your wife for those, though conditions or lapse in judgement that did occur should be called out.\n\nYou have to see this for what it is and that's an attempt to blame shift this event on to you.  You don't need to get mad or argue about it, just get to the root cause of the mistakes that lead to it.", "[removed]", "YTA but ESH also applies.\n\nIf ny daughter fell and hit her head, I dont effing care my boss is there, I am leaving the eff out and heading home to my baby. Period. What kind of parent doesnt? This concerns me a lot!\n\nThough using snapchat is a weird way to communicate, at least she made an effort... a bad one but an effort nonetheless... you just continued to drink with your buddies...\n\nWere I your wife, I would not be mad, I would be livid and you would be sleeping on the couch at minimum...", "If it was an emergency she would have called. Social media sucks and I avoid it. Personally, even if I texted, I think my husband still would have called to check in but I don\u2019t think you were neglectful.

And you could have called instead of sending a snap back.", "ESH.\n\nIt is bloody scary to see your kid slip in the tub. A tub fall can mean serious head injury, broken bones, etc. So even if the kid was fine, your wife was probably a wreck. \n\nMy kid slipped in the tub once, and even though she wasn't hurt and I'm normally chill, I had to call my husband into the room so I could step away and compose myself. \n\nYou should have picked up the phone and checked on everyone, and offered to come home, not treated it as a minor thing. \n\nYour wife should have made the situation clear, like, \"kid is ok, I'm a mess, can you please come home\" instead of leaving you to guess.", "How old are you both that you're hooked to snapchat 24/7", "I came home from work one day and found out my son had a broken arm.
