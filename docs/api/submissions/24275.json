{"id": 24275, "submission_id": "15mq0n1", "title": "AITA for checking out of parental duties after my wife said I\u2019m not the father?", "selftext": "My wife and I have been married for about 4 years. She brought 3 kids from previous relationships into the marriage while I have none. They moved into my house after the marriage because I live in a better school district. Obviously we\u2019ve had our ups and downs but overall it\u2019s been good until a couple of weeks ago when I woke up and found a large dent running down the entire passenger side of my car. The dent is about a hands wide, starts at the front fender, and runs down all the way to the rear tire.\n\nI was furious and thought someone side swept my car as it was parked on the street. I checked our doorbell camera to see if it recorded anything and was surprised to see our 16 year old daughter sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night and driving off in my car. She later returned hours later stumbling into the house. Outside of those 2 events, the doorbell camera didn\u2019t record anything else but a couple of passing cars that didn\u2019t come close to mine. I angrily showed my wife the recording and told her our daughter needs to be punish but she said that she\u2019ll talk to her. I argued that talk isn\u2019t enough which led us into an argument. My wife argued that the new family dynamic has been hard on the kids while I argued that it doesn\u2019t excuse the damage done to my car. I wanted her to agree to ground our daughter from social media and make her get a job to pay for the damage. We argued for hours until she said I don\u2019t get a say in any punishment because I\u2019m not her father.\n\nThat ended the argument and I walked off. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve checked out of any parental duties. I\u2019ve been an adult and still make sure the kids are safe and fed but I haven\u2019t done anything a father would do. They had doctor\u2019s appointments last week for their checkups because they play sports in school and I refused to drive them causing my wife to have to take off work. They start school next week and I\u2019ve dropped them off ever since they moved in but I told my wife she\u2019ll have to do it this year. She argued she can\u2019t because of her work schedule and I answered a mother would figure it out. She called me a child and to grow up. I think since I\u2019m not the father I don\u2019t have to take on the responsibilities of one but obviously she disagrees. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit\n\nI was angry when I wrote it so I left out some info. \n\nMy wife wants me to report it to my insurance as a hit and run. She said that way no one has to pay for it. I argue that I\u2019ll have to pay for it in the long run because they\u2019ll jack up my rates.\n\nI\u2019m not ignoring the kids and I still talk to them daily. I just don\u2019t do or make any parental decisions like I stated above. Also the other day our son asked me if he should play basketball or football and I told him to go ask his mother.", "created_utc": 1691611734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mq0n1/aita_for_checking_out_of_parental_duties_after_my/", "score": 559, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I say you aren't the AH though, because it's normal to disagree with your spouse on punishments for kids, but at the end of the day you have to compromise and come to an agreement on what to do. If she thinks she gets to make all the decisions when it comes to the kids, then they are her responsibility and she needs to deal with that. You can just be the fun, no responsibilities step dad as far as I see it.", "ESH, your wife is being unreasonable for not holding her daughter accountable or doing anything about her drunk driving (and for saying you're not their father which, while a technically true statement, is horrible to say to someone who has been acting as a parent).

You two need to sit down and talk about exactly what your relationship and expectations with the kids will be. And her daughter drove drunk, wrecked your car and hoped you wouldn't notice. Your punishment sounds fair. She is going through a lot but needs to be punished.", "NTA she will throw it in your face whenever she doesn\u2019t agree.", "YTA.  Not to your wife who made her bed and can lay in it, but to the kids.  They have lived with you for four years and after all of that time, which I assume you have grown into somewhat of a father figure to them, you have decided to just checkout of their lives.  Seems like a really dickish thing to do to them for something your wife did to you.  Punish the correct person.  If your stepson wants advice as to sports then dont brush him off like old laundry because he wants you, not his mother, but you blew him off because of your wife's attitude.\n\nAlso, your wife is asking you to commit insurance fraud.

Tell your wife either she pays for the damage to your car or her daughter gets a job and pays you. If not, you go to the police and you report to your insurance who damaged your car.

She said that way no one has to pay for it.\n\nInsurance fraud is a crime.  Don't do it.  Also, you had better report the theft of your car and the accident to the police.  She obviously hit *something* with it, and there's a good chance a camera somewhere recorded your car and it can be traced back to you.\n\nThen I think you should separate.  Her daughter committed *at least* three serious crimes: auto theft, drunk driving and hit and run.  She has put you at risk of being sued and possibly arrested.  You can't live in a home where that behavior isn't dealt with.", "She called you a child, and your response is to act like a child. \n\nGet a fucking divorce if this is how you're going to behave. \n\nYTA.", "NTA.  But this situation isn't tenable and you need to have another conversation with your wife.  She needs to understand that she doesn't get the help parenting from you while she neglects helping you parent; she can't have it both ways.  Either she wants you to have a parental role, with enforceable actions/consequences for the kids, or she can do all the parenting.  You also need to decide in the long run, if you're willing to stay in a marriage with a woman who has kids who won't let you be a parent to the kids.", "ESH.", "She isn\u2019t your daughter, your wife is correct on that.  But does that mean you live in a house constantly disrespected or no authority?  No, but it a different level and nuances as a step parent then as a parent.  Parents retain authority divorced or not.  Steps don\u2019t.  Also kids don\u2019t inherently \u201crespect \u201c steps -with good reason- punishment should come from the parent and be consistent.  \n\nYou and your wife needed to discuss before marriage what the standards of punishment and expectations of the kids were, to make sure you were on board.  You were the one entering an established situation, the adult responsible to check compatibility.  But here we are\n\nI think a key thing you\u2019re missing is you think of taking the kids to school, etc. as purely \u201cdad duties\u201d and not husband duties.  Helping your partner manage their responsibilities is what marriage is about.  You need to look at some of these activities through the lens of supporting your wife, not as dad obligations/rewards, but as spousal support-part of what you signed up for marrying someone with kids.\n\nThings like \u201chey what sport should I play\u201d isn\u2019t pure dad role either.  You aren\u2019t unilaterally deciding, saying which is possible financially, it\u2019s a kid asking an *opinion* of a respected result.

Your wife can't have it both ways. If she wants you help with parenting, she doesn't get to pick and choose what you get to be involved in.

What if she caused a fatality. You have stepped up for the kids & your wife told you that you are not the father. I don't blame you.", "Nta but another conversation needs to be had. \n\nWhat her daughter did was not something that would simply involve her parents. If it wasn't your car, but a stranger's that was damaged, then mom would HAVE to punish her/daughter would receive discipline in the form of claims against her for a car accident. It sounds like because it's your car she's choosing not to punish and you're the one being punished instead by having to pay for the damage. \n\nI think you should definitely talk to your wife again because this isn't just an issue of family dynamic, it sounds like mom is trying to play a good guy here in that the move has been difficult but tough shit, the kids will have to adjust eventually and excusing all their misbehavior is just going to teach them that they can get away with anything. \n\nHer daughter snuck out, stole your car, damaged your car, and if the \"stumbling into the house\" is a result of drinking, she drove drunk as well which is inexcusable.

You can try and be a good father even when you're mad at your wife (for very reasonable reasons).", "First, I agree with your wife, these aren't your kids. It doesn't sound like you met them when they were young but rather came into there lives at a point when their development was already well underway. \n\nI firmly believe being a step parent is the hardest parenting job on the planet. It has zero real authority, is frequently diminished by the child, but requires the same sacrifices and cost as a biological parent. It often just plane sucks.\n\nAs for the punishments, I don't like either yours or your wife's parenting style. It sounds like she was potentially drink driving which in my opinion goes way beyond something a job and no socials can fix. I'd have copped the cost of the car repair but been calling all her friends parents to find out who she went out with and where she procured the alcohol (also to humiliate her with her peers) and I'd be volunteering her at local hospital/homeless shelter/really anywhere with alcohol abuse for the next few years so she can see first hand where this can lead. She also wouldn't be driving any car again until you had the money to buy her own and pay for registration and insurance - if that takes til she's 20-25 so be it.\n\nNow the part that I think makes you an AH .... How dare you refer to that child as your son while refusing to have even a basic conversation with him about his choice of sport. You are a small, petty, insecure AH and don't deserve to be considered a parent to that boy. We get it, you are hurt because you feel like your position in their lives has been diminished. Personally, I think your belief in your position was shockingly unrealistic. If your wife and you divorced today would you be paying her child support for those kids til each turns 18? Would you be requesting partial custody? If not you are not an equal parent to their mother, that means you don't get equal input or equal responsibility. However, it doesn't mean you have no responsibility which is what you are doing now and that makes you an AH.", "NTA - blending families is stressful, but that\u2019s what therapy is for.

She brought 3 kids from previous relationships into the marriage while I have none. They moved into my house after the marriage because I live in a better school district. Obviously we\u2019ve had our ups and downs but overall it\u2019s been good until a couple of weeks ago when I woke up and found a large dent running down the entire passenger side of my car. The dent is about a hands wide, starts at the front fender, and runs down all the way to the rear tire.\n\nI was furious and thought someone side swept my car as it was parked on the street. I checked our doorbell camera to see if it recorded anything and was surprised to see our 16 year old daughter sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night and driving off in my car. She later returned hours later stumbling into the house. Outside of those 2 events, the doorbell camera didn\u2019t record anything else but a couple of passing cars that didn\u2019t come close to mine. I angrily showed my wife the recording and told her our daughter needs to be punish but she said that she\u2019ll talk to her. I argued that talk isn\u2019t enough which led us into an argument. My wife argued that the new family dynamic has been hard on the kids while I argued that it doesn\u2019t excuse the damage done to my car. I wanted her to agree to ground our daughter from social media and make her get a job to pay for the damage. We argued for hours until she said I don\u2019t get a say in any punishment because I\u2019m not her father.\n\nThat ended the argument and I walked off. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve checked out of any parental duties. I\u2019ve been an adult and still make sure the kids are safe and fed but I haven\u2019t done anything a father would do. They had doctor\u2019s appointments last week for their checkups because they play sports in school and I refused to drive them causing my wife to have to take off work. They start school next week and I\u2019ve dropped them off ever since they moved in but I told my wife she\u2019ll have to do it this year. She argued she can\u2019t because of her work schedule and I answered a mother would figure it out. She called me a child and to grow up.
