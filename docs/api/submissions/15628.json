We dated briefly (around six months) in our first year of college and quickly realised we were far better off as friends. We\u2019ve been close ever since, going through some really rough times together (when I had depression & when his dad died) and of course all of the good times (he was in my wedding party when I married my husband). \n\nThere\u2019s a group of us from college who have also remained really close, including Tom. Every year we go away for a long weekend together to catch up. Partners have always been included, some have become permanent fixtures and others have come and go. \n\nTom has been dating Kate [25F] for two years now. She came on the trip last year, I\u2019ve seen her multiple times since then as well and I thought we got on fine. Yesterday though she messaged me and asked if I could sit the trip out this year. Apparently, she doesn\u2019t actually like my continued friendship with Tom and didn\u2019t want us to spend three nights away together (she would be there and so would my husband). She said while she knows there isn\u2019t anything between us it makes her uncomfortable knowing that I know Tom better than her. \n\nI asked her if I\u2019d done anything to make her feel that way and she said no it was just how she felt. At that point I said that sounds like a you problem and I won\u2019t miss seeing my friends because of a non-existent issue. I told my husband, Tom and the others and they all thought I was right to say no. But now Kate is blowing up my phone saying I\u2019ve undermined her, and didn\u2019t even acknowledge her concerns. Now I\u2019m wondering if maybe I was too dismissive and mean by telling everyone.", "created_utc": 1682412346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yd9ks/aita_for_going_on_a_trip_when_i_was_asked_not_to/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is Kate\u2019s problem for being jealous and for thinking that every ex still has feelings for the other if they get along well, this is not you not acknowledging her concers it\u2019s just that this is an issue only she has with you. It makes no sense to ask you to sit the trip out if Tom\u2019s also taking her and you\u2019re taking your husband. Yikes.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t sit this one out & also show Tom her messages. He needs to know that she is highly insecure, controlling, & trying to sabotage his friendships.", "NTA If she\u2019s uncomfortable (whether it is reasonable or not), the only acceptable solution is for her and Tom not to attend. How ridiculous to ask you to stay home.", "NTA it's not your fault she's insecure", "NTA, sorry but Tom\u2019s gf is ridiculous. She seriously expected you to sit out on an annual trip that you helped originate?! Girl get out of here!", "NTA but I do wonder why she\u2019s suddenly feeling this way. Doesn\u2019t seem like anything has really changed and it\u2019s quite weird to be insecure about a fling from 10 years ago.", "NTA, \nIf you\u2019re with someone you need to be able to trust them. From what it seems, your husband understands and trusts that Tom is only a good friend and you have all moved passed and through anything remotely romantic.\nPeople are allowed to be friends with members of the opposite sex.  \n\nI feel that if you sit this out once, you will no longer be going away as a group as long as Tom has her as a girlfriend. \n\nIf the group cared to have you there, then they also deserve an explanation on why you\u2019re not. You\u2019re not lying by saying that Kate is not comfortable with you being there. \n\nKate needs to have some trust that Tom has been above board and truthful with her, otherwise she\u2019ll be second guessing everything he does and who he knows.", "NTA\n\nIf she can't deal with you being there she has the option not to attend.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed to see your friends and she seems to be very insecure for no reason. But I think saying \u2018that\u2019s a you problem\u2019 was probably not necessary and might\u2019ve aggravated the situation.", "NTA\n\nSure does sound like a her problem. And that sucks, because she's clearly experiencing some insecurity that she doesn't know how to work through, but that's between her and Tom and shouldn't have any influence over your perfectly normal and appropriate friendship.", "NTA.  If she doesn't like you there, she can stay home, but then Tom will probably not go either.", "NTA Kate sounds quite insecure.", "NTA. Those are your friends since college, not hers. If she has an issue with you, she's allowed to sit this trip out and tell her boyfriend about her feelings.", "NTA she is being insecure and you should not be excluded from the friend group you've been apart of for years because she's feeling unstable in her position as Tom's woman. I'd go and have a good time with your husband and friends. If Tom himself is saying she's doing too much and she realizes that there is no issue than you are not undermining her. She literally asked you not to come because she doesn't like you and you said no.", "NTA. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA this is a her problem and something she needs to talk to Tom about because there are probably some bigger trust issues in that relationship. She literally could not give you a reason to why she felt like that. Go on this trip and have fun.", "NTA, it truly is a her problem.\nMaybe she should tell Tom they can't attend and then give her ridiculous reason as to why that is.", "NTA \n\nHer solo problem should be fixed by her. \n\nNot by you.", "Pff...NTA. In no way. She's trying to be sneaky and you're clear with the other parties involved. Suck it up Kate! Your BF will always have a history with other people, if thats not the case, you should run!", "Wow, talk about projection. Obviously she feels excluded and doesn\u2019t like the way Tom acts around his friends. \n\nYou had every right to get a group consensus about this request. It\u2019s irrational. How in the world did she think this was a good idea? \n\nNTA.", "NTA\nMy best friend was male and my ex husband hated it. He knew there was nothing going on but his insecure little brain couldn't handle it. However he knew if he asked me to choose I would choose my friend because my best friendwould never ask me to choose. My best friend sadly has passed away now, I miss him. \nYour friends gf sounds the same her insecure little brain can't hack it and she knows he will choose his friends over her and who wouldn't. Its not your problem and your friend and his gf has to deal with it. Also not wrong for telling everyone she isnt part of the core friend group she doesnt get to try and exclude you. \n\nAlso Tom should see the messages she is sending so he knows what she is about. Unfortunately unless she can see the light I see her being a major problem, my ex was. But me and my best friend had been together through our bad childhoods from 13 and kept each other strong no person could break us up. We loved each other but in a platonic way, none of his gf ever raised an issue with my friendship with him it was clear we were friends to everyone.", "Big yikes\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Tom needs to keep looking, she\u2019s not the one!!!\n\nNTA", "NTA. What nerve to ask you to miss seeing YOUR friends on the annual trip. If she has a problem, she should be asking her bf not to go. Why does she think she\u2019s more entitled to attend than you??? Your ex needs to run away from this one.", "NTA\n\nShe either trusts Tom or she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple, and as you said, it\u2019s not a you problem.\n\nShe needs to have this discussion with Tom, not you.", "Well you\u2019re no AH for still going and telling her as such. Her insecurities are nothing to do with you, if she wants to stop the situation she should be trying to convince Tom not to go. I suspect she doesn\u2019t want to do that though because she doesn\u2019t want Tom to know. I also suspect she\u2019s worried that he\u2019ll pick his friends and you over her. \n\nHowever, telling everyone about it feels uncalled for. You could argue that she\u2019s trying to remove you from the group so you\u2019re entitled to blow it up in front of everyone, but you could have kept it quieter than you did. \n\nOn the whole though, NTA. If she can\u2019t get passed Tom having people that know him better than her at two years that\u2019s on her.", "ESH not for saying no but for telling the whole group. Talking to your husband and Tom about her weird request is 100% fine .... but you shouldn't have aired Tom's dirty laundry to all your shared friends.", "I get where she's coming from; she doesn't truly see you as just her boyfriend's \"friend\" but she also sees you as his ex. Regardless of what you and Tom decided your relationship with each other is; its made her very uncomfortable; seeing that you're technically his ex.\n\nI think that is her main issue; perhaps she's never kept a close relationship with her exes and therefore doesn't feel that your relationship with Tom translates well? \n\nI've been happily married for 16 years and even to this day, my husband does not want to meet my first ex - even though my ex and I have been super close as friends (we dated between the ages of 15 - 16 years old and I'm now 43) my husband does not ever want to meet him. Yes, it makes me very sad because I think they'd get along like two peas in a pod but I also think that maybe because my ex and I had been intimate, my husband is weirded out by the concept of seeing and meeting this guy and I have to respect my husband's wishes because it isn't a situation that he will be comfortable in.\n\nSo perhaps Kate feels like my husband; its weird (to her). She may find it exhausting being around you in a social situation in general because she knows you are his ex and I feel like its a little wrong for you to try and force her to feel otherwise.\n\nShe has asked you to not go on holiday with them because she is his partner and is feeling a little weirded out. Not everyone in the world is going to be okay with your relationship with Tom (including the history). \n\nI think its fabulous that you and Tom are able to continue to stay friends; that's amazing however, I think you also need to respect her boundaries. That's his partner now; another human being. If it isn't going to be her, its going to be someone else later down the line and the bottom line will be - how much do you want to be a detriment to Tom's romantice relationship (present or future).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes his current gf is being insecure, but just think if you would be comfortable if your husband had the same type of relationship with an ex. If that thought bothers you, then theur likely needs to be better boundaries in your relationship with your ex.

This a hundred times tbh.", "So does she plan to isolate Tom from every close friend he knew before they got together? Gross. She needs to work out her own shit and leave you and everyone else out of it.", "Did you initiate the break up with Tom?
