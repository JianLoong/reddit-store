Do you think only deserving people get pregnant? That it\u2019s some kind of reward for good behaviour?", "NTA, but I think you could probably adjust your attitude on these issues rather than thinking about it in such a black and white manner. Substance abuse is very complex and being shamed about it isn't likely to encourage people to get treatment, which is especially important for pregnant women.", "YTA. I do understand your point but it\u2019s such a harsh thing to say, it\u2019s one thing to say you shouldn\u2019t drink while pregnant and another to say you don\u2019t deserve to be a mother. There\u2019s so much shame steeped into lost pregnancies and then guilt mothers feel for any issues their babies might have we don\u2019t need to add to it. Your friend\u2019s mother may have not known she was pregnant while drinking and blame having a glass of wine for losing the baby. We\u2019re going to find a way to blame ourselves when the reality is her drinking likely had nothing to do with her miscarriage. \n\nI have kids, I did drink while pregnant with my second as I didn\u2019t know I was pregnant yet. She wasn\u2019t planned, and I didn\u2019t drink after I thought I might be. I\u2019m a great mother and I\u2019m done beating myself up for being human. \n\nIt\u2019s also a cultural thing too, North America is very abstinence based when it comes to alcohol and pregnancy while in other countries it\u2019s more accepted or even recommended, for example the hops in beer has been said to be good for the fetus. \n\nThere are studies that show that the effects of alcohol on sperm can cause issues in resulting pregnancies yet we aren\u2019t policing men about their consumption, while of course agencies such as the WHO are making sure women know that even unintentional exposure may harm a potential fetus if a woman of childbearing age consumes it.  \n\nMy point isn\u2019t that women should drink while being pregnant, it\u2019s that we need to stop being so hard on them. A shot of whiskey thrown back by a pregnant woman would make me cringe too though- that just hits different!", "They wouldn't go and force alcohol down a random stranger's throat in a pub, so why they would basically do exactly that to a being they claim to love, one who is so very vulnerable, is beyond me.\n\nI've known kids with FAS and it is sad to see because it was so very avoidable.\n\nSo NTA for me, harsh as your comment may have been.", "Nah, was ready to be against you, because a glass of wine is not criminal; but yeah Whiskey?

This is what your friends agree with, and got sensitive because she had a guilty conscious for her mom who happened to have a miscarriage(could be totally unrelated to drinking but regardless I\u2019m assuming you did not know this was a sore spot) I would apologize for hitting it and try not to touch on that subject any more", "The amount of people deciding there is nothing wrong with occasional drink while pregnant just because we don\u2019t have research about it (because it would be highly unethical to conduct them) is baffling.\n\nNTA OP, you are entitled to your opinion and they might not like it but honestly if you are aware of your pregnancy and yet choose to have a drink because craving, knowing that alcohol is bad and there is a chance it actually might harm your baby and yet you are still taking this chance instead of waiting 9 months then you are simply selfish and not ready for motherhood.\n\nThere is no research paper that proves that small amounts of alcohol have no impact on fetus development, we do know they do not cause FAS but if there is a chance it might somehow harm your future baby, why would you take this gamble?", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to point out the dangers of drinking whilst pregnant and it\u2019s another to say she doesn\u2019t deserve to be parents. You could have handled that better.

You came across incredibly judgemental.", "I'm probably gonna get downvoted to hell but I'm going NTA, I was born with FAS, my older brother was born with it as well and my mother chose to drink over her own kids so I'm in definitely deserve to be a mother group.

It\u2019s one thing to say that drinking alcohol could be harmful to a fetus. It\u2019s entirely another to decide that someone isn\u2019t deserving to be a mother. Especially considering that the large majority of women who report minimal drinking during pregnancy have perfectly healthy babies.", "YTA. There is a way to handle such discussion with tact. You were a bull in a China shop. You told a person you JUST MET your extremist opinion on women who drink while pregnant. You acted like you were a 12 year old making crazy statements for Tiktok views.", "NTA. How is \"People who knowingly put their fetus in danger shouldn't be parents\" a hot take? If having a drink merits playing the FASDs lottery for your child you don't deserve to be a parent. \n\nIt sucks that it was a sore spot for her. But there's two options, either you're close enough that she tells you about the issue and you can avoid it, or you're not close enough to know about it and you're not to blame because you couldn't know. If you didn't know, you can't be an asshole, even if your comment hurt her. Let her go through her issues, help her where you can, apologise for hurting her if you get the chance, but don't blame yourself or feel guilty.", "YTA. You gave a really extreme opinion to a bunch of people you don\u2019t really know about a very sensitive topic.

My mother had a drink or two while pregnant and she was the greatest, most hard working, understanding parent I've ever met. She absolutely deserved to be a mother. Excessive/binge drinking is bad, obviously. But you're making a blanket statement here. There's lots of data on binge drinking during pregnancy. But not so much on someone having a handful of drinks over the course of 9 months, at what point in the pregnancy the person is, etc.", "Many pregnant people have a drink here and there. My doctor sister and all her doctor friends had the odd small glass of wine. I choose not to. But you gave a really judgemental opinion, unsolicited. If people like you less because of that... It's pretty predictable.", "NTA I think it's harsh but at the same time I hate people who drink while pregnant so I get where you're coming from. Everyone can decide for themselves, I can't stop people from drinking while pregnant but there will definitely be judgment from me and if it's my friend, a stern talking to. This is how I was raised by my doctor mom and I firmly believe no amount of alcohol is safe in pregnancy.", "It isnt only excessive drinking that causes FAS, it can be caused by small amounts of alcohol too", "Nta, i agree with you and it sounds like emily is being defensive bc that might be exactly what happened with her mom.", "You were unlucky enough to say this to a person whose mother had a miscarriage which she might have thought was related to her alcohol consumption. I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t go to her mother and say that she doesn\u2019t deserve to be a mother and you probably wouldn\u2019t have said it to Emily if you had known about her mother. Sometimes awkward things like that happen, where we don\u2019t know what others have been through and a nonchalant comment end up upsetting someone.   \n\n\nOf course you can be mad at women who value their alcohol to the point where they drink it while knowingly pregnant even knowing that there are reasons to believe that it could be harming their child even if it\u2019s a small amount. Of course it is ok to express that frustration when you\u2019re hanging out with two friends. It would be a different thing if you e.g. worked with pregnant people and whenever someone admitted to consuming alcohol you would tell her she didn\u2019t deserve to be a mother. I think it could be a good idea to apologise to Emily and say that you wouldn\u2019t have said it if you knew about her mother\u2019s experience or that it would upset her. NTA.", "NTA you couldn\u2019t have possibly known that she had a personal tie to that. you stated a fairly common opinion that is backed by science.", "Nta. But it's really only in the last 20-30 years that we have been aware how dangerous it was to drink at all while expecting. My mother, while pregnant with my brother, 35 years ago was advised by doctor and midwife to drink 1-2 bottles of stout because she was borderline anaemic. Even 20 years ago when I was pregnant with my son I asked a few doctors about alcohol while pregnant and the advice was moderation. When I asked what that meant I was told 2 glasses of wine an evening was safe. Now I didn't drink anything at all but I was curious because there was a lot of different information in the media at the time. It's now known that no alcohol is safe at all so I would judge modern mothers for it but not older mothers who were only following doctors advice.", "NTA - Sometimes only 1 or 2 drinks can cause damage to the baby, even FAS. Sure, a lot of people may have produced perfectly healthy babies after consuming alcohol while pregnant. But I think if you\u2019re willing to take that risk on an innocent baby, it speaks to a major character flaw. So I agree with you OP.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nA drink while pregnant doesn't harm the growing human.\n\nBeing an alcoholic might, but that's more about the addiction than the substance.\n\nFor context: most of Gen X had a mom who had drinks while pregnant.

Drinking in the first trimester should be absolutely avoided. It is the period when the organs form and alcohol, even in small amounts can affect them and cause problems. In the second half of the pregnancy, Abt after week20, it is fine to have a bit of wine (couple gulps) or 100-150 ml of beer no more than once a week or less. With the condition that the drink is naturally brewed and has no additives. No hard liquor during the pregnancy. Meaning that anything with a concentration higher than 13% and any alcohol in copious amounts must be avoided. Otherwise the baby is at high risk of being born with developmental disabilities and alcoholism. \n With that said it is not ok to judge the women who had a bit of wine in the last trimester and say they are not fit to parent. There are plenty of people who followed all the rules during pregnancy and are horrible and abusive parents.", "Might be controversial but I\u2019m going to say NAH.\nI\u2019m coming in as a mum of two that doesn\u2019t drink at all. \n\nThere is a difference between a half glass of wine at an occasion than tossing back shots on the nightly. This isn\u2019t a black and white topic that should be brought up so casually. \n\nNow you have every right to not believe people shouldnt drink while pregnant. So don\u2019t do it when you\u2019re pregnant.  Other people are ok with having half a glass of wine hell many doctors aren\u2019t against that. But FAS is a factor that people can\u2019t ignore. \n\nAs with most pregnancy topics you\u2019ll never get people who will agree with you 100%.

Some who think autistics shouldn\u2019t have children. Hell there are people who think only a man and woman should have children. \n\nHere\u2019s my take mind your own uterus. This is not a discussion you have with randoms. This is a discussion you have with your spouse, maybe your family and very close friends.", "YTA for your delivery. I couldn\u2019t drink when pregnant because I couldnt bare the risk of it but many woman have a few sips of champagne at a wedding or a small glass of wine at a dinner and it will do them and the baby no harm. Same as breastfeeding, studies show that it\u2019s like a shot in a swimming pool for alcohol in breastmilk but most health organisations say zero for one reason only, to cover their own backs. Same as no sushi no rare steak etc. they don\u2019t want to be sued if have some sushi because the risk is low and they tell you it\u2019s okay to eat.\n\nWoman are blamed for miscarriages even those beyond our control. Maybe her mums miscarriage was because of alcohol but more likely it was going to happen regardless and there was nothing she could have done. You are also judging those who know know they are pregnant and drink not realising they have a foetus to protect. I have a friend who had an accidental pregnancy and spent a very very boozy weekend celebrating her 30th before she knew she was. Should she feel guilty no she shouldn\u2019t she didn\u2019t know and wasn\u2019t trying. Does that mean the baby should be taking off her absolutely not.

While the medical field has to say that no amount of alcohol is safe, it has also been proven that small amounts of alchohol does NOT cause harm - but we can't say that as a message because moderate amounts DO cause harm, and people have WILDLY different ideas of what is \"little\" and \"moderate\".\n\nBut one drink of alcohol during a whole pregnancy? No, that is not harmful. And it's more about policing pregnant women than about avoiding harm to the fetus, in the end.\n\nIF she is addicted (as in she CANNOT wait until after pregnancy), then yes, she literally CANNOT wait, she can literally die if she goes cold turkey, and needs treatment and HELP, not judgement (you're too EVIL to be allowed to care for the child you are growing in your own personal body!!!).

There is no recorded case of FAS in someone whose parent drunk singke cup of wine every other day or so.

First off, it\u2019s highly unethical to study pregnant drinking women. Lots of data after the fact, not so much during the actual pregnancy. There\u2019s not really a hard and fast rule as far as what\u2019s safe and what isn\u2019t or why. Most people, the world over, can have a few drinks through pregnancy with no problems, while someone else may have a different experience. Maybe it\u2019s how their body breaks it down, or something the fetus is predisposed to. Personally, I had no desire or craving for alcohol, so it was easy for me. (Although I ate sushi and lunchmeat, muhahaha!!!) but I met a friend of a friend who was at right about the same point of pregnancy who was regularly polishing off whole bottles of wine. I was pretty shocked the few times we hung out, but after her baby was born, she was perfectly fine and 13 years later continues to thrive (except for the fact her mother transitioned into raging alcoholism). I also knew a girl in college who continued to drink fairly regularly and her son was born with some issues that I just can\u2019t help but attribute it to alcohol consumption. \n\nSo, I guess my TL;DR here is that while sure, a drink here and there is probably safe, there is no data to say what amount and how often is considered 100% safe. For me personally, I sipped half a glass of champagne once the entire 9 months of pregnancy at a celebration. I just didn\u2019t feel like the risk/reward was there.

If less educated or more anxiety full parents report no drinking, then their kids will be affected no matter what effect of alcohol was. Conversely, if only people from families with issues report small amount drinking, the effect will be opposite.\n\nBut, imo, some people are really really invested into making any amount of alcohol sound like there is active threat of FAS.", "Hm interesting.
