Can you not help your mother with working out what her options are? Sitting down with her, going through her finances, researching on her behalf her different options?

These can be up to 100% of the fees. \n\nIt will, of course, be much easier if your sister is bright and doing well at school.", "NAH, but barely.

CPS isn't the way to go, but reaching out for social services with your mom (not against her) and making sure she and your sister are both getting their needs met might be an option. Or taking her in but finding a care person to be with her while you travel could be an option. Or helping financially somehow so that your mom has more options to pursue, or....any show of support other than the \"it's not my problem\" vibe you are sending now.

Surely you could afford a nanny or boarding school? Or the father could? Or there is another family member who can assist?", "Up front, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for not wanting to take your half sister in, particularly given the monumental impact it would have on your career and future. You didn\u2019t have the child, your lifestyle isn\u2019t suitable for a child, you certainly don\u2019t have to change everything for your half sister\u2019s care. I also think it\u2019s insane for your mum to \u2018offer the child support as compensation\u2019. If you\u2019d be taking your sister in, you\u2019d be eligible to child support from both parents, not just the dad. Your mum certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to keep it.\n\nThat said, I do think there are more options than simply your half sister ending up in foster care or you giving up your job to care for her. She\u2019s 14 and you\u2019re clearly earning a lot, put her in boarding school on the weeks you\u2019re away (or all weeks). At 14, your half sister should realistically be capable and independent enough that she could survive alone for a week during the holidays when you\u2019re away, and you could try to adjust your schedule to avoid a month away during summer holidays. You could also pay a live in housekeeper to be there when you\u2019re not if boarding isn\u2019t suitable. I\u2019m sure your mum would be happy to contribute what she\u2019s able if she\u2019s going into a care home. If neither of those are options, do you have other family or close family friends who might take your half sister in for some financial support?\n\nTLDR - not the asshole for refusing to give up your career but I hope you look past that as the sole option. Your half sister is already 14, so it\u2019s only 4 years until she goes to college, don\u2019t let her fall into the foster care system when you could do something.", "Info, do you know your halfsister?

I never said OP was an asshole for not taking in the sister, that is not something for everyone. Im not delusional. I said OP was TA for their complete lack of compassion toward their sibling in this situation. They don\u2019t need to become a caretaker, but they can do more than \u201cI have a job, figure it out\u201d.", "I actually didn\u2019t have a relationship with them tbh. I was 12 when my first brother was born. I lived with my dads side and he lived with our moms side. I was 15 when my second brother was born. I moved out on my own at 16. Got custody when I was 23. I saw them, but we only lived together for maybe a total of 6 months as kids. We weren\u2019t close, but they were children who did nothing wrong and I didn\u2019t want them to go into the system like I did. I could have let them, it wasn\u2019t like I was forced. I opted in and did the work to be a foster parent so they could live with me instead of strangers. Not super relevant, but I thought I should clear that up. \n\nSo no, they weren\u2019t dumped on me. And you are coming from the angle that all of this should be \u201chealthy\u201d. It\u2019s already not. The mom had a stroke. The sister is essentially an orphan. Nothing about this is going to be ideal. Never said OP had to take the sister in, but the fact that they have zero compassion makes them TA.", "I agree. But the reality is society is an AH so we have to be good people when we are able to.", "That\u2019s a nice thought. But if father is meeting child support, he is doing his part in the eyes of the law. He can\u2019t be made to take the sister in just like OP can\u2019t. Realistically the sister will go to foster care. OP wouldn\u2019t be asking this in the way they worded it if there were other options. \n\nIm not saying it\u2019s is OPs responsibility. And never did. It wasn\u2019t my responsibility to raise my brothers. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s responsibility to raise anyone else\u2019s children. I thought that would be implied. \n\nBut it is my opinion that if you can write off your sibling this easily after they\u2019ve essentially become an orphan then you are indeed an AH. I don\u2019t care what the parents did, where they\u2019re at, none of that matters. The sister is innocent of all of it. She should not be further dismissed and abandoned by their sibling because her dad is an AH that chose to be absent and her mom had a stroke. I wouldn\u2019t be calling OP TA just for saying no to taking in a child. That isn\u2019t for everyone, I know that. But to be completely dismissive in this manner is just heartless in my opinion.", ">Or why can\u2019t OP help financially so their half sister can stay with their mother? \n\nOP stated that their mom is moving into a full care facility.  Maybe this is because their mother elected to do so as she is no longer able to care for herself and **not** wanting to put the onus upon a 14 year old taking care of her too.  I can just imagine that the 14 year old wanting to help her Mom and the Mom feeling guilty that a 14 year old not living her life because she's trying to take care of Mom.  \n\nI do agree with a lot of other commenters who suggested boarding school or a nanny and going to court to force the father to pay the fees for these services.", "It's nice to say that . But the reality is he is not there . She can also afford to . A world where we don't care what happens to our family because someone else should is not a good place.", "Irrelevant. I'm not saying she has to give up her job to watch her, but hiring a baby sitter or putting her in some sort of day program wouldn't make a dent in $100k+", "As someone who was abandoned and homeless at 15, trust me the sister will see it as deceit by both the parents and the siblings. Amazing that you have such strong opinions on something you haven\u2019t experienced yourself.\n\nMy family were all poor, OP is financially sufficient to help. He\u2019s in at least the top 5% of earners globally, so yeah if you can\u2019t afford to help out your younger sister, that makes you a bit of a prick \ud83e\udd23 (by my morals) \n\nI am also a 6 figure earner and never would I cast out family/ friends who needs me and these people aren\u2019t children.", "He said he would lose six figures by changing jobs. So I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s making like 150,000 plus. (Because even entry Walmart or warehouse or fast food is making minimum 45k a year, and I\u2019m assuming he could transfer whatever the hell it is he does do to a lower but somewhat related position, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s gonna go from CEO to cleaning bathrooms, just go from CEO to inside sales or something in the same industry.) He\u2019s gone for every other week, does not mention a wife or girlfriend who would not approve of raising a child. I\u2019m married to a teacher both of us made about 50k each until recently so I understand 100k doesn\u2019t go far. But that\u2019s for two gas for two groceries for two utilities for two large enough space (housing) for two. Hobbies and dining out and whatever for two. If one person blows through 100,000 or 150,000 they are living excessively and putting their luxury lifestyle over their family. But I still said NTA. His money his choice. I\u2019m just pointing out that\u2019s excessive for 1 man. What\u2019s he do eat steak and lobster three times a day, have like ten sports cars, a private jet and a mansion? Guess I\u2019ll find out soon cuz I\u2019ve just accepted a position making six figs that I\u2019ll be starting soon, and feel absolutely blessed that I\u2019ll be able to get out of debt and help my family and friends. My grandma is living in a dilapidated mobile home without heat or air conditioning in a bad neighborhood that the police patrol for high crime rates. I\u2019ll be able to get her out of there into a studio apartment or something better. Husband and I have a three bedroom townhome nothing lavish. Travel once or twice a year, etc. Now that our income is growing by like 50-60 percent I\u2019m not changing my lifestyle I\u2019m paying off student loans and helping family but that\u2019s just ME I would never judge someone who did whatever they want with their money. I\u2019m happy to be in USA. I read somewhere in this thread that in France he would be required by law to take the child and or pay financially for it just because they\u2019re related and that\u2019s horrible. As someone else pointed out no child should be forced to bear the burdens and responsibilities of their parents. However not an asshole but his unwillingness to cut a little bit of his luxury budget a bit to toss mom and sis some money to prevent the child from going to foster care is cold. Cold but legally within his rights and best for the child. Taking a child in and resenting her and or not being there for her more than 50% when she\u2019s at that crucial age of sex and drugs and peer pressure, she\u2019s better off in the system than with this man.", "There are other options like boarding schools, a nanny, and split residency. But that doesn\u2019t really answer the question. I had, who said she had to quit?", "If that would work, she could stay with mom as well.", "I get what you are saying, but the point was that the pressure should be on the father to step up, not on OP to take in the kid.", "The OP needs to raise her half-sister but it is okay for he father NOT to raise his daughter.  It doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t\u2026IT IS HIS DAUGHTER!!!!", "If OP uses mons income the sis will most likely qualify for scholarship to cover a significant part of the costs.", "Half sibling.  And, if they've never built a relationship, it's just genetics, not an actual connection.", "The whole point is OP doesn\u2019t want a kid, travel is just one of the practical reasons she can\u2019t. Not the one thing holding her back.", "They can but you have the right idea there. By most standards, unless the grandmother was granted guardianship (a serious process that takes a lot of work and cost) of the 14 year old, the custody would revert to the father who can then reassign custody with an attorney. The father could also drop the kid into the foster system. There are options, but custody almost always reverts to the other parent in case of death, unless there were provisions in divorce/custody agreement for the custody to be transferred to someone else in case of death.\n\nDefinitely not a good situation for the kiddo while this is going on though.", "They can\u2019t force it no, but they can drill in and basically guilt him by making it clear she\u2019d become a ward of the state if he doesn\u2019t.

Whoever is looking after the mum should be taking her child into consideration. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about being a good or kind person, this is about a major life change. \n\nI say this as someone who has had to change my life over and over to look after a mum with a mental age of 5. It\u2019s more than money, so much more!", "Where did OP say they make \"multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars\" in salary? All they said was they'd have to take a six-figure pay cut to take this on.\n\nAnd OP is already paying for the mom's care, which I am sure is not exactly cheap. If OP has to give up their job to care for a sibling they barely know, who is going to pay for the  mom's care facility?", "are we not understanding that it\u2019s more than just giving money to someone to watch her while OP\u2019s gone? this is a huge responsibility to basically become a full time support system and financial support system to someone. just because she is 14 and can be fairly independent doesn\u2019t mean that this also wouldn\u2019t take a toll on OP especially if mom passes away and they become full guardian. i\u2019m not saying that OP shouldn\u2019t do anything but what I am saying is that there\u2019s way more that goes into this than just throwing money around.\n\nedit: words", "Do they? OP is somewhere in their mid 20s, and the sister is on 14, so pretty clear they did not grow up together. Also pretty clear there is not a close bond between them. OP doens't feel they would be a good fit to be responablie for her, as they travel for months at a time.\n\nThey don't want a gurdianship of her cause that would make them responsable for her. They wont be available, wont be able to take care of her or look out for her. \n\nAlso pretty clear they don't want to. All these suggestions that OP take some kind of role are ignoring that fact. And honestly, the fact OP woudl not make a good carer for thier sister. Aside from the traveling, there is just no desire to want to raise a kid. OP knows that.

He has the greater responsibility here, and so all legal means should be used to get him to step up to the plate and bear his responsibility, which is huge.", "They're focusing on who's responsible, not on what's the best placement for the kid. Different questions with different answers.", "Op could also pay for an i home carer for mom", "Cool. Still not her responsibility. It shouldn\u2019t be up to others to pick up the slack of a deadbeat dad. And guess what? The reality is that the dads about to have no choice but to be there. Chances are pretty good that legal action will take place. At no point has OP indicated not caring about her sister, it is simply not her situation to deal with.", "But also some people don\u2019t have the privilege of having a close or a good relationship with family. It\u2019s all about perspective here. It appears as though OP does not have a close relationship with his half sister. He owes her nothing. The father should be the one stepping up.", "You have no idea what OP's other expenses are so you can't say that those costs \"wouldn't make a dent.\" But I can tell you that the cost of boarding school + the cost of mom's care that OP is contributing to already + the cost of full-time care to look after the sister during school breaks while OP is on an extended trip would not merely make a dent; it would make a crater.", "She does not have any responsibility here.", "But the dad is the one with the responsibility to step up.", "Oh my sweet summer child. I have experienced it. My mother is a piece of trash (who is finally dying) and her 10th and 11th kids were removed due to abuse. There was a meeting to decide who could take them in. I lived alone and had a job. So according to you, I should have taken them in right? But my job wasn't full time, it was a temp job. I lived in a 1 bedroom apartment. I could barely pay my bills and I lived in a completely different state. Add to the fact that I was attending therapy almost every week to deal with the voices in my head. Should I still have taken them in?\n\n\n\nSometimes you have to put yourself first. If you can't handle raising a kid, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T RAISE A KID. The only person that HAS to step up is the FATHER.", "You're making an awful lot of judgments about OP's expenses and lifestyle with zero evidence any of that is true.\n\nAnd as I have pointed out elsewhere, OP is already contributing to the cost of their mother's care.\n\nYou don't even know that OP is a man, btw.", "Yea, you like to think that. Should I count how many moms have tried for years to get child support and can't? The guys disappear.. Which it sounds like here.. They get paid under the table.. They lie (gasp)!

What needs to happen is mom needs to go to court for her child if op is feeling like helping he can help her find a nice lawyer she needs to tell the court the situation and that her circumstances changed at that point bring up boarding school and see if she can get the father put on the hook for payments. We also don\u2019t know how well daughter does In school to say she can get a scholarship because that\u2019s not as simple as you request one so you get it there are going to be multiple children filling for it and it\u2019s usually who the school seems will do best there and go on to be successful. Even the low income scholarships don\u2019t cover the whole cost. It covers what the school seems fair.

Everyone is making it seem like this is not going to 100% alter op life if she takes care of this child because it\u2019s only 4 years. Well she will need school supplies, travel for events the school throw, if she wants to participate in her senior years activities, what if she can\u2019t get into boarding school now op has to pay for a nanny now your asking her to fork out at least 60k a year, plus all necessity, your dealing with a child that will have abandoned issues so we don\u2019t know what her mental health is like.

Wasn't the whole idea of \"baby boxes\" where the mother can put her newborn up to a month old into a baby box at a fire or police station, totally anonymous, wasn't that designed around coming up with a way a mother could abandon her child without going to jail, and this was necessary precisely because of the likelihood that a woman who abandons her child will go to jail?
