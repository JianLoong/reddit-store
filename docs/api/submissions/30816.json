Can you not help your mother with working out what her options are? Sitting down with her, going through her finances, researching on her behalf her different options?

These can be up to 100% of the fees. \n\nIt will, of course, be much easier if your sister is bright and doing well at school.", "NAH, but barely. You are pretty close minded about helping, and it comes across as lacking empathy.

CPS isn't the way to go, but reaching out for social services with your mom (not against her) and making sure she and your sister are both getting their needs met might be an option. Or taking her in but finding a care person to be with her while you travel could be an option. Or helping financially somehow so that your mom has more options to pursue, or....any show of support other than the \"it's not my problem\" vibe you are sending now.

Surely you could afford a nanny or boarding school? Or the father could? Or there is another family member who can assist?", "Up front, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for not wanting to take your half sister in, particularly given the monumental impact it would have on your career and future. You didn\u2019t have the child, your lifestyle isn\u2019t suitable for a child, you certainly don\u2019t have to change everything for your half sister\u2019s care. I also think it\u2019s insane for your mum to \u2018offer the child support as compensation\u2019. If you\u2019d be taking your sister in, you\u2019d be eligible to child support from both parents, not just the dad. Your mum certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to keep it.\n\nThat said, I do think there are more options than simply your half sister ending up in foster care or you giving up your job to care for her. She\u2019s 14 and you\u2019re clearly earning a lot, put her in boarding school on the weeks you\u2019re away (or all weeks). At 14, your half sister should realistically be capable and independent enough that she could survive alone for a week during the holidays when you\u2019re away, and you could try to adjust your schedule to avoid a month away during summer holidays. You could also pay a live in housekeeper to be there when you\u2019re not if boarding isn\u2019t suitable. I\u2019m sure your mum would be happy to contribute what she\u2019s able if she\u2019s going into a care home. If neither of those are options, do you have other family or close family friends who might take your half sister in for some financial support?\n\nTLDR - not the asshole for refusing to give up your career but I hope you look past that as the sole option. Your half sister is already 14, so it\u2019s only 4 years until she goes to college, don\u2019t let her fall into the foster care system when you could do something.", "Info, do you know your halfsister?
