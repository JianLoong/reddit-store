To start with I have a sister and two best friends (let\u2019s call them Halley (24f) and Natalie(25f)). Because of my sister\u2019s sensitive feelings towards the engagement she will not be in the wedding. My bridesmaids will just be my two childhood best friends and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s two sisters. \n\nWe all discussed who should be my maid of honor and we decided to do the thing from Friends where we\u2019ll all take turns as a maid of honor for each person\u2019s wedding and I would start it off because I was getting married first.\n\nNow I\u2019ve known Halley since we were 8. We\u2019ve been best friends since childhood and Natalie did not come into our lives until we were 18. Which would probably explain the shock to Halley when I chose Natalie as my maid of honor.\n\nHowever, I chose Natalie as my maid of honor because Halley had been growing a part from us for years. When we were 22, Halley had gotten involved in this all encompassing relationship with a new guy and barely had time for us anymore. We talk maybe once a week while I text Natalie almost every single day. When we all meet up, Halley has an excuse to leave early almost every time leaving me and Natalie to bond more over random things. Since Halley\u2019s been in this relationship, I just feel as though I\u2019ve gotten closer to Natalie as a friend. \n\nEven more - it was getting aggravating because Halley was always criticizing us when we were together. Talking about our days in high school and mentioning flaws and mistakes we had already grown out of. It was exhausting spending time with her because she was always talking about her boyfriend or wanting to change the topic to her boyfriend. It felt like she didn\u2019t know anything about me or Natalie anymore.\n\nHowever, when I announced Natalie as my maid of honor, Halley called me throwing a huge fit over the phone. She was devastated I hadn\u2019t chosen her has my maid of honor citing our history and how long she\u2019s waited for this and how much she values our friendship. She then talked about Natalie and I weren\u2019t nearly as close and it just wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nI told her she\u2019s just been distant lately with her boyfriend and her job but I still wanted her as my bridesmaid. She then called me a bitch and to let her know when I felt like being a real friend again.\n\nA part of me feels like she has a point because she\u2019s the closest thing I have to a sister outside of my sister. But another part of me feels like she\u2019s been incredibly unsupportive of me as of late and I don\u2019t want someone like that as my maid of honor.\n\nI told her I would thinking it over and I\u2019m still thinking it over.

It sounds like Natalie is the one who\u2019s going to make lots of effort, and put lots of time into the role. Halley seems preoccupied with her own stuff.

I get the sense she just wants the title and won\u2019t do the work involved. Stay strong in your choice.", "NTA but maybe I may offer another perspective as well: The older you are, the harder it gets to maintain friendships, because adulting is legit hard. The fact that you've been friends with Halley for 17 years and you still manage to talk once a week is a great thing!\nI am 37 now and of course there are people I talk to almost every day but sometimes those friendships last only a couple of years. On the other hand I have a few childhood friends that I talk to every few weeks/months and these relationships will probably last for decades.\nI get that you are disappointed by Halleys behavior but I also get why she might be disappointed. I don't mean to belittle your friendship with Natalie but I hope your friendship with Halley does not break because of what is basically nothing more than a symbolic gesture. Good luck with your wedding!", "NTA. She has shown her true colors. She's lucky to even be in the wedding at all with her attitude.", "NTA; y'all's relationship needs definite work and your wedding should indeed be a place where you choose who you feel most suited to the role (and supportive towards you). As for the thing from Friends... yeah putting fun plans in practice in real life sometimes means it feels different when you actually try to put it into motion. Going with your gut and preference instead of holding to the agreement (especially since you were the first) is valid.\n\nThe \"right\" maid of honor is the person that fits. If reconciling with your friend is on the table, awesome, but don't think you need to make someone your maid of honor to appease a grudge or slight.", "NTA - but....why don't you just do what happened in friends? \"I picked her as my maid of honor so that I can be your maid of honor.\" Let her know how important it is for you to do that.", "NTA. \nHer reaction should solidify your choice. \n\nHer reaction sounds a bit over the top. There\u2019s probably more to it. I\u2019d offer to check in with her about how her relationship is going and continue to offer to be her friend. \nHowever, your wedding and your choice.", "ESH. You suck for setting the arrangement to take turns for being MOHs and then going on a rant about how she is a terrible friend and how she is not fit enough to be YOUR maid of honor.\nShe sucks for getting upset she wasn't the one even though you had an arrangement.", "You picked the right MOH for you.

I'd suggest she have *no* roll in your wedding party. You've picked the friend who has proven she can be constantly relied on for the role that you will lean on most. You can't make her MOH now because that's just letting the toddler tantrum win, so now you have a belligerent bridesmaid who historically doesn't care about how she makes you feel.\n\nHalley assumed she was more important than Natalie because she's stuck in her own world, is that the kind of person you want \"supporting\" you on *your* day. She barely even sounds like a friend, just someone you've known for a long time.", "Nta\nFirstly congratulations. Not been easy for you between your sister and your so called friend. Its not always about who you have known the longest. Stick with your choice. If she doesn\u2019t like it then its maybe time to cut ties. Its about you and your man. Not her.", "NTA.

Also, your MOH seems a caring friend who loves you and will be there for you.\n\nYour other friend, on the other hand, seems to want all the privileges of a friendship without putting too much effort towards you.\n\nPls, don't tell yourself you made the wrong MOH choice... You chose who was present for you, and the person wit whom you bonded the most. It's the most logical decision you can make with your heart.\n\nGood luck OP. And please, update us!"]}
