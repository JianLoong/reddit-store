After dinner my son and the other boy left the table to play video games but still in earshot. \n\nThe rest of us stayed at the table chatting, the conversation turned to tattoos and my friend mentioned my ex/baby mama's brother who has some seriously impressive tattoos. My wife made a comment about how their whole family is covered in tattoos and that my son would be covered in a few years. I responded that I wouldn't mind as long as they weren't shitty tattoos and she replied about him becoming unemployed trailer park trash like his mom\u2019s family. \n\nI became mad that she spoke about my son like that and how she characterized my ex's family. My initial response was \"I can't believe you just said that.\" I followed this up by essentially telling her she had no right to talk about my son\u2019s family like that and pass judgement on people she doesn't know. I also told her I don't agree with her sentiment that tattoos equal unemployment and that also the majority of my ex's family are happily employed and several of them are business owners. The brother with the nice tats for example was a semi-professional boxer, has a master\u2019s degree, and owns his own business. \n\nMy ex's family have a bad reputation and a lot of them do live in a trailer park and several of her brothers and uncles have been in and out of prison. However, she has a large family and the majority of them are great people, but they are all heavily judged in our local community. They were also such an important part of my life when I was younger, my ex and I had out son senior year of high school, my family were unsupportive but hers were our village, and we couldn't have done it without them. My ex's grandpa gave me my first job, her brother helped me find a cheap car to buy and helped me fix it up. They were my family for years, and although I'm no longer close with them, they are still important to my son, and I see their positive influence in him all the time. My wife doesn't know them but I know she's heard positive things from my son so I don't understand why she would say what she did.\n\nThe night moved on but things with my wife remained awkward even after we left. When we were getting ready for bed, she told me I was an asshole for speaking to her like that in front of our friends and for defending my ex and making her look like a jerk in front of everybody. I was aghast and told her she was the one that spoke diminishingly about my son and his family while he could hear her. I slept in a different room and didn't speak to her for the rest of the night.\n\nHowever, today I went to the gym with my brother, and he thought I was an ass for blowing up at her in public and that I should have waited to mention what she said at home. He also thinks I'm coming of as an ass for defending my ex's family to my wife and that it sends the \"wrong message\".

Keep taking up for your people because they may not be blood but they ARE family.", "NTA", "I love how people do grimy and disrespectful things in public, but demand that someone talk to them in private. How does that even work?? Any discomfort your current wife felt was well deserved and was outweighed by the need for you to defend your child in the moment. NTA", "NTA. Not only did you ensure your wife won\u2019t speak like that again in front of you or your friends, but you also nipped any misconception that your friends could have been forming in that moment in the bud. Great job! If your wife doesn\u2019t want to sound like an asshole, maybe she shouldn\u2019t talk like an asshole.", "NTA", "NTA, this one hits close to home for me. Run far away from anyone who would talk about your son like that.", "She sounds like she thinks she\u2019s better than people based upon aesthetics. She should quit running her mouth about people she doesn\u2019t know if she doesn\u2019t want to be put on blast. OP NTA", "NTA You defended your son. Half of your son is your ex and her family, how can your wife have a genuine relationship with your son when she thinks this way?", "NTA. Maybe not referring to it as your ex\u2019s family would help people see this more clearly, they\u2019re your son\u2019s family. And she straight up trashed your own son. She\u2019s so far out of line, it reflects poorly on her character & she\u2019s the only trashy person in this story.", "Nta she didn\u2019t just look like a jerk she was being a jerk", "NTA, you did the right thing. I have tats and teach elementary school. Definitely not trash. \ud83d\ude43 I don't live in a trailer park, but there are some really nice trailer homes better than most family homes.", "NTA you advocated not only for your son, but for his family  (ppl she never even met but spoke ill of). With no regard for your son's feelings or if he could hear. You did nothing wrong, sometimes ppl need to be shown they are an ass to know they are being an ass. If she felt awkward she put herself in that position bc she was in fact an asshole there.", "Eh..... NTA because in case your son heard ANY of it... He knows he's loved and that his daddy has his back.", "Your brother doesn\u2019t like confrontation but that doesn\u2019t mean YTA here. \n\nWhat she said was 100% wrong and if your son heard, which he did (and if he didn\u2019t this time, he has or will hear it eventually) this will do lasting damage to him and their relationship. \n\nShe\u2019s already building it up in his head they he\u2019s lesser than with these comments. \n\nThis sounds like a really shitty situation to be in; she is wrong and I hope she sees why.", "NTA. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be corrected in public, then they shouldn\u2019t do the high school mean girl behavior of talking negative about someone behind their back, especially someone she doesn\u2019t know.

My folks are divorced and always spoke negatively about the other parent and their families to us kids. As an adult, I am gobsmacked that they didn't consider our feelings at all in the moment.

Do you know the possible damage to your relationship with your son had you not responded the way in which you did? Let's hope he was too engrossed in the game to hear. Your wife needs to humble herself and apologize for being a judgmental classist to all parties involved\n\n\n\nAs for your brother, he's not wrong interms of defending your wife and not embarrassing her in \"public\" but in this situation because your friends may have known your ex, you allowing your wife to further embarrassing herself and you was a wise decision.

Diminishing your sons family in earshot was a disgusting move and deserved immediate action on your part so great work there.  Your allegiance is to your children first as it should be.", "NTA She said it publicly, your son needed to hear you defend him publicly. Good for you. Your brother is an AH though.", "NTA. You're fucking dope bro. Good dad and good dude.", "NTA. And ask your son how his stepmother talks to him when you're not about, but not when she's about.", "NTA, she didn\u2019t need any help in looking like a jerk. She did that all by herself. Thinking tattoos = unemployment is such an out dated way of thinking. I have tattoos and have never had an issue, and I can\u2019t even count how many colleagues I have had over the years with tattoos. She sounds jealous and you did the right thing.", "NTA.  I have tattoos and piercings, make six figures working in Corporate. Your wife and brother are definitely in the wrong here.", "NTA, most definitely defend the mother of your child if she is an active parent in their upbringing. This will teach them in turn to be respectful of women because of how they hear/heard you talk about their own mother. Your wife needs to reflect on her insecurities and immediately stop making negative comments about the mother of your child.", "NTA: I\u2019d be FURIOUS if someone disrespected my child and told me he would be unemployed trailer trash, but the fact it came from his step mom, someone who is supposed to love him and be part of his support network. It\u2019s so much worse.", "Hell nah at the end of the day that is YOUR SON that YOU had with her plus why from speaking about tattoos the moment someone related to your ex wife was the turning point because why suddenly get negative Nancy over tattoos and say that plus about YOUR sons family . Had the boy heard that I'm sure that would've made him trip out as a kid you know . Definitely NTA if it will make you feel less of a jerk just talk to her about it", "I have a 13 year old daughter, and if my spouse said something like that about her, I wouldn\u2019t be married for very long.

There's a time to talk and a time to keep silent.", "NTA if your son heard that he also heard you defend them.", "NTA but I think there are deeper problems here. She says that so casually it makes me wonder what she says to him behind your back and he's kept quiet about it! Also there is nothing wrong living in a trailer and the industry in in a lot of us have tattoos, gaugedand ears and differently dyed hair and make up to 120,000 a year depending on location and certification.", "TA. Your wife was also in the wrong big time, but most couples have (or should have) an agreement that they don\u2019t strongly criticize one another in front of others. Better would have been a \u201clet\u2019s discuss this later\u201d.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. She deserved to be called out and I hope that if your son heard what she said that he also heard how you responded. That's his family and they've given your wife no reason to disrespect them.", "Best to handle the conversation in private if possible, but your wife was the AH for being so judgy and snobby as well as bad mouthing your sons family. He is half the people she was trash talking. She made herself sound like a jerk and tacky. You are NTA.", "NTA", "NTA, I respect you for standing up for your ex's family.  and your right, she had no business talking negatively about your sons family. You did good.", "NTA. What you don\u2019t say in public reflects on you. You needed to defend as it was the right thing to do and it shows your son that you would bat for him. \n\nYour wife and brother are TA.", "Alright, so there are a few things wrong here. First of all, she had absolutely no right to say what she said and where your son could hear, too. Not okay. One bad apple doesn't mean the whole family is trash. Also, assuming that someone with tattoos means you're unemployed is a very dated mindset. Most people now a days have tattoos. My extremely Mormon family has tattoos, and they're insanely successful. I'm heavily tatted, and so is my immediate family, and we are all employed and not living in a trailer park. Even if we were who the hell cares? As long as you have a roof over your head and food in the fridge, you're doing just fine. \n\nAlso, the way that she blows up on you for putting her in her place is out of line. If she says something shitty like that, she needs to be ready for backlash. \n\nYour brother is wrong, too. It was completely within your right to tell her off after what she did. I honestly hope my friends would do the same for me if someone said something like that about me behind my back. You're a good person! \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your wife said your son was going to end up trailer trash like his family?  How much you want to bet she\u2019s said shit like that to that kid privately.  She\u2019s an AH.", "You shut down the negative talk, stood up for your son and his family who weren't there to speak for themselves. That shows me you're courageous and a great dad.\n\nIf you tell your wife what you told us about the family, I imagine she'll think differently. Best of luck to you all.", "NTA", "You defended your son's family within earshot from him. That goes a long way for your son. Im sorry about what your wife said. It was in poor judgement, to say the least. People might think you were an asshole to your wife but youre a hero to your son. Guess you chose the lesser evil, if that makes sense.", "I\u2019ve never understood this sentiment. Someone talks out the side of their neck about someone without any disregard yet you\u2019re a supposed to cater to their feelings by correctly them \u201cgently\u201d? No, you are NTA. Your wife should have kept her mouth shut. Especially since she was talking about your child\u2019s family.", "NTA your kids should always come first. If she didn\u2019t want to be called on her behaviour publicly she shouldn\u2019t have acted inappropriately publicly", "NTA. You were not defending your ex-wife's family, you were defending your SON's family. Your wife is the asshole for making those comments and she is the only one who made herself look like a jerk.", "NTA. You did the right thing to stop the conversation when it happened so it wouldn't have become a worse conversation when she said you misunderstood, or took it out of context, or she didn't say what you thought she said.  Your son's mother's family will always be part of his life and her badmouthing them is not the right thing to do particularly when your son was within ear shot!  Even if he wasn't, her comments were unnecessary and unkind.", "Damn. I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re an AH or not, I just want you to take at least a high school English class and learn how to tell a story. I really hope you don\u2019t talk like this.", "NTA and good on you op. If you didn\u2019t shut her down straight away and in a way that made her realise to not do that again the behaviour would only get worse. Next time it would be in front of your child and more outrageous. \n\nYour brother is an AH. He should want what is best for your son.", "I think you could have approached this with more tact, but NTA. You can tell her it\u2019s not ok to talk about your sons family that way and that it\u2019s disrespectful in front of others (and you should). But you should also show your son how to respect people even when they do bad/unacceptable things.", "NTA - it's ridiculous that people would equate tattoos  with trash in this day and age.  My sister is a specialised teacher and I work in IT, both with tattoos and coloured hair, both earning well over the national average for many years. Our tattoos have always been visible but never an issue towards promotion or  respect.\n\nIt sounds like there are some deeper jealousy issues that your wife needs to address,  as well as discussions you need to have in regards to how she she feels about, and interacts with, your son.", "Defo nta", "NTA - your brother is thinking that you should have your partners back in public and reprimand them in private, which is applicable in some situations. However, saying this in front of your child warrants a reprimand. She disrespected your child and his family right in front of him and he is not old enough to adequately defend or advocate for himself. It was important that you showed your child that you would defend him, regardless of who it was. Your wife needs to grow up and learn that gossiping isn\u2019t cute, especially whenever it comes to family matters. \n\nGood on you! You\u2019re a great parent.", "I'm gonna go with NTA because I don't think just leaving it to discuss later in private is an option. Your wife disrespected your sons mother in front of other people, and you needed to speak up. That said, it's a razor-sharp edge (very difficult) to call her out on it without being insulting right back to her. If all you condemned is her comments / choice of words, then I think you are in the ethical \"right\" here. But I get her being mad. Don't hold your breath that she will apologize to you or even walk back her comments, but maybe won't feel brazen enough to try that again since you spke yp about it.\n\nAnd hopefully she realizes that badmouthing people unnecessary is not something you get a free pass on just because it's an ex.", "NTA, sometimes people need to be humbled in the moment. It would have sent a worse message to your son if he was paying obvious attention and you didn't address it.\n\nIt's great that you support your son and the relationship he has with your ex's family.", "How long have you been married to this woman? Has she ever treated your son bad before this?\n\nYou are NTA btw but your wife is.", "NTA, imagine if your son had heard, he'd have heard his father defending him, the people he loves, and whatever future he wants. Good fathers are a rare commodity, keep it up king", "YTA! Respect your wife,  even when she's wrong.  Pull her aside without causing notice if you can't use visual cues to shut her down.  \n   She has to be your number one loyalty.  When she screws up,  help her fix it but don't call her out in public or she now has a license to do it to you.", "NTA So, what if you did what your brother said... and she did the same thing again? And again? She knows she'll get a tut tut and that's all. Calling out bad public behavior (from anyone) is a lot like correcting a child or a pet when the action happens. Remembered much better. It has the benefit of also letting everyone else know your position on those words and that you won't stand idly by when someone feels like spewing them. At one point I was going to take someone aside and have a chat, but he just kept at it. Nuke. He kept his mouth shut after that. I guess he ruined the chances of anyone else having me show leniency in time and place when their words were chosen in that time and place.", "NTA your wife made herself look bad", "ETH\n\nYes, your wife stuck her foot in her mouth, but you are her teammate and partner. She needs to trust you and vice versa \n\nFlip it and if you stuck your foot in your mouth, would you handle the situation better with being kicked in front of everyone or having a genuine discussion in privacy", "NTA. How come she gets to humiliate your ex-wife in public but you can't do that to her?", "NTA, she should NOT have spoken about your son that way-- even if he had not been in earshot, that would have required a correction. Her need to feel superior to your ex can't come at your child's expense.", "NTA. I will never forgive my dad for the things he allowed my stepmom to say about my mother. You did the right thing to defend the mother of your child from baseless bs, even if she is an ex.", "I agree about asking your son if she speaks down to him when you\u2019re not around. If this was a first time thing, she would\u2019ve said something like \u201coh my gosh you\u2019re right I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t think about him being able to hear\u201d, but her doubling down is pretty troubling. NTA", "I would really like to know what she says to the son when OP isn\u2019t around. She\u2019s willing to speak rudely about the son and the family to OPs face, so it\u2019s not a far jump to think she\u2019s said rude stuff to the son. What a horrible thing to say about your step child, she sounds like a peach.", "NTA at all! This comment sums it perfectly!", "Nta- and this is my first response too..who the hell are you to decide my child's future ? And what the fuck is wrong with a trailer park? Are they aware trailers cost as much as a house? It's the land they are renting? Not to mention , what an elitist prick", "Reprimand?\nNo. Partners don\u2019t \u201creprimand\u201d each other. \n\nETA, OP.", "Right! I guarantee she's talked crap about his family when dad wasn't around", "Good call on what she says when OP is not around, it\u2019s probably worse. And it may have been Said in front of the son without OP to say something.", "That's probably why she felt the need to diminish them, tbh. Insecurity. The way women treat their spouses' ex-partners nearly always has something to do with how they perceive themselves and very little to do with the ex or the spouse, in my experience.", "Yeah, this is really concerning. There is no way.she says this so casually in the open in front of OP and guests w/ the kids able to hear and not saying worse to the kid when she is alone with him.", "She said it in front of friends.", "Even if she did know the family, she still doesn't have the right to be snobbish.", "lmao \"classism is fine because everyone does it\" isn't the penetrating insight you think it is", "Also like you said: tattoos do not mean unemployment-I\u2019m heavily tattooed, pierced, and color my hair bright colors-the owners of the hotel I manage don\u2019t believe my exterior makes me unprofessional\u2026my attitude maybe 20% of the time. I\u2019m employed, well so, and happy and have a great team and responsibilities. She\u2019s talking out of hatred and jealousy.", "When someone insults your child these \"agreements\" don't matter.", "But that implies that OP doesn\u2019t mind speaking badly of his ex while the son *can\u2019t* hear\u2026 which the son would\u2019ve taken in the worst way possible. NTA", "It drives me insane when people make comments in public, are corrected in public, and then get upset about being corrected in public. If you don't make rude statements in public, nobody is going to correct/scold you for those statements in public! 'In front of our friends' isn't some cone of silence that means you can make derogatory comments about step son's family in front of the friends and OP has to smile and nod until the friends are gone.\n\nOP NTA, you clearly have your son's back and respect that side of his family. That's going to mean a lot to him in the future, good for you!", "My thoughts exactly. There are several single and double wide trailers nicer than my house haha I live in a nice house but some of the ones I\u2019ve seen are spectacular and huge.", "Wrong. If you\u2019re partner is knowingly insulting your child then you have every right to reprimand, tell off or just flat out tell them to go hell with their opinion. The wife was dead wrong to say that they\u2019re her own step child was going to end up unemployed and trailer trash simply because OP made a comment about the possibility of his getting a tattoo in the future. She went nuclear and then doubled down when she was called out on her crap. OP is NTA for defending his son and his ex family. She\u2019s the ahole and a stupid one at that for thinking she could say whatever she want and not have any consequences.", "Or done worse....", "Wouldn't be surprised!", "Doesn't matter if he heard it. If someone insults my children they're gonna get told off, no matter what.", "So he should prioritise his wife over his own son? that's an awful take. Hypothetically, i would also scold my son for publicly shaming his stepmother's family."]}
