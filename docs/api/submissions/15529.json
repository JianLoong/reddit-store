{"id": 15529, "submission_id": "12wrf7c", "title": "AITA for publicly shaming my wife for how she spoke about my son's mom and her family?", "selftext": "Last night my wife, my 13-year-old-son, and I had dinner with another couple I\u2019ve known since high school and their two kids at their house. After dinner my son and the other boy left the table to play video games but still in earshot. \n\nThe rest of us stayed at the table chatting, the conversation turned to tattoos and my friend mentioned my ex/baby mama's brother who has some seriously impressive tattoos. My wife made a comment about how their whole family is covered in tattoos and that my son would be covered in a few years. I responded that I wouldn't mind as long as they weren't shitty tattoos and she replied about him becoming unemployed trailer park trash like his mom\u2019s family. \n\nI became mad that she spoke about my son like that and how she characterized my ex's family. My initial response was \"I can't believe you just said that.\" I followed this up by essentially telling her she had no right to talk about my son\u2019s family like that and pass judgement on people she doesn't know. I also told her I don't agree with her sentiment that tattoos equal unemployment and that also the majority of my ex's family are happily employed and several of them are business owners. The brother with the nice tats for example was a semi-professional boxer, has a master\u2019s degree, and owns his own business. \n\nMy ex's family have a bad reputation and a lot of them do live in a trailer park and several of her brothers and uncles have been in and out of prison. However, she has a large family and the majority of them are great people, but they are all heavily judged in our local community. They were also such an important part of my life when I was younger, my ex and I had out son senior year of high school, my family were unsupportive but hers were our village, and we couldn't have done it without them. My ex's grandpa gave me my first job, her brother helped me find a cheap car to buy and helped me fix it up. They were my family for years, and although I'm no longer close with them, they are still important to my son, and I see their positive influence in him all the time. My wife doesn't know them but I know she's heard positive things from my son so I don't understand why she would say what she did.\n\nThe night moved on but things with my wife remained awkward even after we left. When we were getting ready for bed, she told me I was an asshole for speaking to her like that in front of our friends and for defending my ex and making her look like a jerk in front of everybody. I was aghast and told her she was the one that spoke diminishingly about my son and his family while he could hear her. I slept in a different room and didn't speak to her for the rest of the night.\n\nHowever, today I went to the gym with my brother, and he thought I was an ass for blowing up at her in public and that I should have waited to mention what she said at home. He also thinks I'm coming of as an ass for defending my ex's family to my wife and that it sends the \"wrong message\".

He heard the love and respect you have for him and the rest of family, his mom, uncles and grandparents.  If you didn't do that, he'd have gone to sleep thinking you agree with his stepmom, that he'll end up unemployed in a trailer park.  \n\nYou're a good dad.  Your wife though clearly not only disrespects your ex and her family, she clearly also disrespects your son.  Talk to him directly.  Ask him about your wife, and listen.", "NTA \nI would also try to talk to my son and see if your wife ever made bad comments about his family when you're not around. Since she seems so comfortable to say that when he could possibly hear her.", "NTA\u2026who the hell is she say that about your son in public.  Good on you for sticking up for your son regardless of if he heard or not.  Who says that a child will become unemployed trailer trash?  She said this in conversation and you responded appropriately in my opinion. She looked like a jerk in front of the friends because she acted like one and spouted nonsense.  You stood up for your kid and his moms family.  \n\nI shudder to think what she might say if you weren\u2019t around.  Please ask your son if she talks about his mom and her family to him.", "NTA. You were right to reprimand her. As for waiting until you were home, nope. She said it in front of everybody, she deserves to be set straight in front of everybody.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make her look like a jerk in front of everyone - she did that all by herself.", "NTA and if I were you I would wonder what she says about them and your son when you aren't present to defend them", "NTA\n\nWhen I first read that you did it \"publicly\" I was imagining this was at some large family gathering, at a restaurant, or on Facebook.\n\nThis was in private, between you and another close friend couple that you have known for over a decade since high school.\n\nIts not like you just put her on blast out of nowhere. She is the one that started bad mouthing to your friends first, it only seems right that you would correct her in front of her friends as well. If you just let it go and brought it up to just her later, it would be unfair to that family as now your friends are going to have a negative bias towards them, and that isn't fair.\n\nNot only did she bad mouth the family, she was bad mouthing your son, revealing that she has such low expectations for the boy that you are raising. That also seems to reveal that she has such a low opinion of you as a father that you would raise a son to grow up to be \"unemployed trailer park trash\".\n\nI think its fair for you to defend the family, especially since you seem to really respect many of them for being good people. But, you probably have even more right to be upset for how she views both you and your son.", "Nta\n\n Your ex's family sound like great people. Too bad your wife doesn't.", "NTA Your wife made herself look like an ass all by herself.", "NTA.  Your wife was berating these people for some sort of social cache - that\u2019s a risky/crappy move generally but is particularly cruel when they were important to you once and are your son\u2019s family.  And the fact that she insulted your son is beyond the pale.  Is she normally a malicious person? \n\nIn any event, you are NTA.  Keeping your mouth shut would have made you a \u201cbetter\u201d husband (I guess), but a terrible father and a shitty human in letting people who were kind to you when you needed it be run down for entertainment.", "NTA but you should talk to your son about how hes trested by your wife when youre not around.

There were plenty of ways to defuse the situation without chastising your wife publicly for making generalizations about your ex in-laws (some of which seem spot on).\n\nIf your son heard the initial comments while playing video games, I\u2019d be surprised.

I\u2019m covered head to toe in tattoos and I make six figures a year as a corporate accountant.", "NTA.

You were absolutely right and justified in what you said, just not in time and place. If it was anyone but your partner, my answer would be different. Losing your cool was fully understandable, but when you're in a relationship with someone, certain things are off the table, IMO. Yelling, striking, and dealing with issues publicly are some of those things. This conversation should have waited until you had privacy. \n\nSome things are understandable but still toxic and unsustainable in a relationship.\n\nEDIT: Someone made a good point. It was important for your son to hear your response. But that also could have been a separate, third conversation about why it was inappropriate of her to say.\nAgain, this is just my opinion on what makes a sustainable relationship.  I wouldn't apply the word \"A hole\" to you in any other situation than an AITA subreddit, and I DEFINITELY would to her. What she said was so messed up.", "NTA. She sounds insecure AND judgemental. The fact that she didn't even hesitate to talk poorly about your sons family in front of him. About people she doesn't know none the less. \n\nShe's mad she was exposed as a jerk and you didn't back her up.", "Exactly!  And doesn't even matter if he's around or not.  You insult my kid?  You might as well insult me.", "This is so important. If your son heard her comment, he was probably listening and waiting to hear your response. And it sounds like you said what HE needed to hear.

Allowing that to stand sends the wrong message. It is silent consent that you are tolerant of her speaking that way to other people and to your son.

His own brother, who probably heard a more detailed explanation that we did, said the OP was being an ass.", "Corrected. Thank you.", "You are correct , I should have said the overall tone was more about how fond he is of his ex\u2019s family - his wife was wrong in being judgmental, however I still believe it should have been handled between them. Calling out your wife in public is not a show of respect, or showing your son how to handle disagreements, nobody is perfect- but  try to model appropriate behavior", "He has a wife also- I truly believe he should have pulled her to the side and then thoroughly discussed it between  the two of them later.  Setting the rules for not bashing on your wife should include the new wife and ex wife. After re-reading this post, he was complaining about his news wife\u2019s characterization of the ex-wife\u2019s family.  He didn\u2019t really mention the son except to say the son\u201dcould\u201d have heard the conversation"]}
