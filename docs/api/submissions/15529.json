After dinner my son and the other boy left the table to play video games but still in earshot. \n\nThe rest of us stayed at the table chatting, the conversation turned to tattoos and my friend mentioned my ex/baby mama's brother who has some seriously impressive tattoos. My wife made a comment about how their whole family is covered in tattoos and that my son would be covered in a few years. I responded that I wouldn't mind as long as they weren't shitty tattoos and she replied about him becoming unemployed trailer park trash like his mom\u2019s family. \n\nI became mad that she spoke about my son like that and how she characterized my ex's family. My initial response was \"I can't believe you just said that.\" I followed this up by essentially telling her she had no right to talk about my son\u2019s family like that and pass judgement on people she doesn't know. I also told her I don't agree with her sentiment that tattoos equal unemployment and that also the majority of my ex's family are happily employed and several of them are business owners. The brother with the nice tats for example was a semi-professional boxer, has a master\u2019s degree, and owns his own business. \n\nMy ex's family have a bad reputation and a lot of them do live in a trailer park and several of her brothers and uncles have been in and out of prison. However, she has a large family and the majority of them are great people, but they are all heavily judged in our local community. They were also such an important part of my life when I was younger, my ex and I had out son senior year of high school, my family were unsupportive but hers were our village, and we couldn't have done it without them. My ex's grandpa gave me my first job, her brother helped me find a cheap car to buy and helped me fix it up. They were my family for years, and although I'm no longer close with them, they are still important to my son, and I see their positive influence in him all the time. My wife doesn't know them but I know she's heard positive things from my son so I don't understand why she would say what she did.\n\nThe night moved on but things with my wife remained awkward even after we left. When we were getting ready for bed, she told me I was an asshole for speaking to her like that in front of our friends and for defending my ex and making her look like a jerk in front of everybody. I was aghast and told her she was the one that spoke diminishingly about my son and his family while he could hear her. I slept in a different room and didn't speak to her for the rest of the night.\n\nHowever, today I went to the gym with my brother, and he thought I was an ass for blowing up at her in public and that I should have waited to mention what she said at home. He also thinks I'm coming of as an ass for defending my ex's family to my wife and that it sends the \"wrong message\".

First of all, she had absolutely no right to say what she said and where your son could hear, too. Not okay. One bad apple doesn't mean the whole family is trash. Also, assuming that someone with tattoos means you're unemployed is a very dated mindset. Most people now a days have tattoos. My extremely Mormon family has tattoos, and they're insanely successful. I'm heavily tatted, and so is my immediate family, and we are all employed and not living in a trailer park. Even if we were who the hell cares? As long as you have a roof over your head and food in the fridge, you're doing just fine. \n\nAlso, the way that she blows up on you for putting her in her place is out of line.

You can tell her it\u2019s not ok to talk about your sons family that way and that it\u2019s disrespectful in front of others (and you should). But you should also show your son how to respect people even when they do bad/unacceptable things.", "NTA - it's ridiculous that people would equate tattoos  with trash in this day and age.  My sister is a specialised teacher and I work in IT, both with tattoos and coloured hair, both earning well over the national average for many years.

However, saying this in front of your child warrants a reprimand. She disrespected your child and his family right in front of him and he is not old enough to adequately defend or advocate for himself.

You\u2019re a great parent.", "I'm gonna go with NTA because I don't think just leaving it to discuss later in private is an option. Your wife disrespected your sons mother in front of other people, and you needed to speak up. That said, it's a razor-sharp edge (very difficult) to call her out on it without being insulting right back to her. If all you condemned is her comments / choice of words, then I think you are in the ethical \"right\" here. But I get her being mad. Don't hold your breath that she will apologize to you or even walk back her comments, but maybe won't feel brazen enough to try that again since you spke yp about it.\n\nAnd hopefully she realizes that badmouthing people unnecessary is not something you get a free pass on just because it's an ex.", "NTA, sometimes people need to be humbled in the moment.

Good fathers are a rare commodity, keep it up king", "YTA! Respect your wife,  even when she's wrong.  Pull her aside without causing notice if you can't use visual cues to shut her down.  \n   She has to be your number one loyalty.

And again? She knows she'll get a tut tut and that's all. Calling out bad public behavior (from anyone) is a lot like correcting a child or a pet when the action happens. Remembered much better. It has the benefit of also letting everyone else know your position on those words and that you won't stand idly by when someone feels like spewing them. At one point I was going to take someone aside and have a chat, but he just kept at it. Nuke. He kept his mouth shut after that. I guess he ruined the chances of anyone else having me show leniency in time and place when their words were chosen in that time and place.", "NTA your wife made herself look bad", "ETH\n\nYes, your wife stuck her foot in her mouth, but you are her teammate and partner.

If anyone called my child trailer trash, I would kick them to the curb so fast their head couldn't stop spinning. As for your brother, he clearly has his head so far up his ass that he's becoming an asshole. I feel so angry on your behalf. Has she said things like that about your ex, her family, and your son before? How does she act around your son? Is she civil with your ex if she's around her? Or is she cold and trying to push your ex away? This is a major red flag, in my opinion. What if your son decides to get tattoos? Will she change how she treats him? If I was in your shoes, I'd be either sleeping at my parents' house or a friend's couch. I don't think I could have slept next to her. I'd need space for a few days to think and process my emotions. OP your wife and brother owe you, your son, your ex and your exs family an apology. And tbh I'd make her apologize in person and let her tell them what she said. She's your sons step mom, not some 16 year old spreading gossip about some poor girl because the guy she likes is dating, said poor girl. She may not need to be his mom, but she can't say shit like that. What if your son overheard her? How would that make him feel not only about himself but how it would affect his trust in her.

For what it's worth I do think that \"I can't believe you just said that\" is leaning towards public admonishment which isn't great, something like \"I disagree, my experience with my son's and ex-wife's family is bla bla bla\" would be better in company and still get the message across that she's put her foot in it until you can discuss it deeper in private.

Can you imagine how a GC, SG and NParent would describe the same situation?  (And having been both the GC and the SG, I know neither understands the story completely.)  I just try to respond to what the OP writes, and sometimes look for what they aren't telling us.", "That is his SON\u2019S family. They will always be OP\u2019s family in some way", "Dude I was thinking the same thing! I was like ok\u2026 so OP\u2019s family and his brother do not like this people, current wife, people where they live at and somehow all this people are the problem. Seems like there is some truth in what they say. Tbh I would divorce OP if I were the wife, is not worth it.", "Ah, thanks for the word of wisdom.  But, my 20+ yr marriage to my best friend is doing just fine.  We publicly disagree with each other all the time, with no obligation to take each others' side all of the time.  It just takes constant communication, respect and personal confidence.", "Well personally, as a woman who is friends with many women, I disagree.", "Looking down on trailer parks while we have shows like Tiny House Hunters makes me so mad. My aunt lived in a trailer and it was lovely. I would live in it.", "I'm sorry, but if my partner said something like that about my child, I'd absolutely reprimand them! She should remember, \"If you can't say anything nice. Then don't say anything at all. What she said was uncalled for! Imagine if OPs son heard that, and OP did nothing. What message is that sending? OP did the right thing. At least if his son overheard that he could hear his dad, who is supposed to protect and love him unconditionally, stand up and make sure she understood that she went too far. She was acting like a Bully and OP shut her little trash talk fest short and had to pretty much explain to a grown assed woman that type of verbal sewage will not be tolerated. Now she's butt hurt because OP defended his son and sons family? Nah she can throw her little hissy fit and enjoy the consequences of her shitty attitude.", "Thanks", "Love your username", "Multiple tattoos here, more planned, university professor. Tattoos have no bearing on the way someone performs their job. Stepmum is an idiot.", "Someone bad mouths, she\u2019s repeating it. OP makes it sound like she doesn\u2019t know them. They are among friends, so maybe she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. It\u2019s like when your shit-talking with your friends and the person your shit talking walks in and you\u2019re like Oops. The OP makes it sound like the relationship is all good between them, so with her spouting negatives, something seems amiss. I think it makes a difference. If you\u2019re that appreciative of your exes family, you don\u2019t trash them. You create that positive harmony with your new wife.", "No definitely not! Still it seems like normal couples should be able to say \u201clet\u2019s discuss this later\u201d rather than escalating it in front of others", "You knkw who you don't spend the entirety of your life with? Your children. Grow up.", "Discuss in private so it doesn\u2019t happen again\u2026.it\u2019s like at work\u2026..reprimand in private and praise in public", "\"OMG, you're so rude to not allow me to be rude to you!!\"", "There are times when I\u2019d agree with that.  Especially if something is hurtful but not noticeable as such by others.  Handling these things in private is generally better.\n\nThis is absolutely not that, though.  The son needed to hear his father stand up for his family.  Even without that, OP would have looked worse for silence and that\u2019s a reason not to be silent.", "For sure. This one really reeked to me of one-sidedness.\n\nI don't know what GC, SG or NParent mean.", "In Texas all mobil homes, trailers, that require help moving must be on half an acre of land. They did that to get rid of low income housing. Which is funny , I loved trailer parks. There was a sense of community only being broke can give.", "The community is the best thing about a good trailer park.  Hell, it's what makes a good trailer park, not the quality of the homes.  Best party I was ever at was just a trailer park and some people had their doors open or were out on their porches with music and food and drinks.", "1. He said the family are well known in the area. \n\n2. She would\u2019ve definitely asked anyone she could for dirt on the ex & her family.\n\n3. His son was listening so even if he does talk shit in private, he still did the right thing to defend them in front of his son.\n\n4. It\u2019s actually none of her business what the family are like.", "How is this relevant? When you can actually form a cohesive sentence get back to me.", "Getting really strong \u2018evil step-mum\u2019 vibes here", "Not when the son is literally in the same room and can overhear them. It would feel pretty shitty if you heard your step mom call you trailer trash and your dad just sat in silence.", "And let everyone believe what the step-mum was saying about his son?? Nahh", "The amount of people who actually have that mentality and are defending it in the comments is scary. They don't even care that the son is there and can overhear. Anyone who has overhead a family member insulting you to other family can tell you how disparaging it is when no one comes to your defense.", "GoldenChild, ScapeGoat and Narcissistic Parent.  To explain that, I'd have to get into the dynamics of a family with a narcissistic parent.\n\nOn a related note, you want to read more family drama? Check out https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/", "He specifically says, my wife doesn\u2019t know them but I know she\u2019s heard positive things from my son\u2026.\n\n1. If all you hear are good things about a family, I find it odd that a person would talk negative, especially if they are supportive of your husband and step-child. \n\n2. Some women do seek the dirt but again, she doesn\u2019t know them and they are supportive. What would be her reasoning? He\u2019s not saying that they are total jerks to him or making his life miserable. \n\n3. Sure but if he is shit talking, he\u2019s putting bullets in the chamber. Maybe he just doesn\u2019t shit talk to her, maybe he does it in friend groups and so she didn\u2019t think anything about spouting off the negatives. \n\n4. No but when you blend families with minor children and both parents are in the picture, the new wife or husband is affected by that relationship. If you have a difficult ex that makes your life hell, your spouse feels that. If you have a great relationship, your spouse feels that too. It also plays a big part in what is said about them. \n\nI think the ex shit talks, his wife repeated and if his son heard, he\u2019ll tell his mom and the OP doesn\u2019t want conflict. I think his defending is deflecting.", "Sure, that\u2019s totally understandable. But instead of standing up for his son, he went off on his wife for insulting his ex in-laws.  That\u2019s why he\u2019s the asshole.\n\nImagine that someone called your mother a bitch who drives a shitty car, and then you spent the next five minutes talking about how great of a car she has.  That\u2019s what happened here.", "Ok wittle baby", "Honestly if I were in the friends' position and OP didn't respond while his wife bashed his son's family with the kid in earshot I'd be judging the OP. Even if it's true, the wife phrased it so dismissively and nastily, there's no reason for that to be near the kid. Nobody likes being stuck dealing with a fighting couple, but watching one make nasty comments while the other sits silently isn't better", "Thank you."]}
