After dinner my son and the other boy left the table to play video games but still in earshot. \n\nThe rest of us stayed at the table chatting, the conversation turned to tattoos and my friend mentioned my ex/baby mama's brother who has some seriously impressive tattoos. My wife made a comment about how their whole family is covered in tattoos and that my son would be covered in a few years. I responded that I wouldn't mind as long as they weren't shitty tattoos and she replied about him becoming unemployed trailer park trash like his mom\u2019s family. \n\nI became mad that she spoke about my son like that and how she characterized my ex's family. My initial response was \"I can't believe you just said that.\" I followed this up by essentially telling her she had no right to talk about my son\u2019s family like that and pass judgement on people she doesn't know. I also told her I don't agree with her sentiment that tattoos equal unemployment and that also the majority of my ex's family are happily employed and several of them are business owners. The brother with the nice tats for example was a semi-professional boxer, has a master\u2019s degree, and owns his own business. \n\nMy ex's family have a bad reputation and a lot of them do live in a trailer park and several of her brothers and uncles have been in and out of prison. However, she has a large family and the majority of them are great people, but they are all heavily judged in our local community. They were also such an important part of my life when I was younger, my ex and I had out son senior year of high school, my family were unsupportive but hers were our village, and we couldn't have done it without them. My ex's grandpa gave me my first job, her brother helped me find a cheap car to buy and helped me fix it up. They were my family for years, and although I'm no longer close with them, they are still important to my son, and I see their positive influence in him all the time. My wife doesn't know them but I know she's heard positive things from my son so I don't understand why she would say what she did.\n\nThe night moved on but things with my wife remained awkward even after we left. When we were getting ready for bed, she told me I was an asshole for speaking to her like that in front of our friends and for defending my ex and making her look like a jerk in front of everybody. I was aghast and told her she was the one that spoke diminishingly about my son and his family while he could hear her. I slept in a different room and didn't speak to her for the rest of the night.\n\nHowever, today I went to the gym with my brother, and he thought I was an ass for blowing up at her in public and that I should have waited to mention what she said at home. He also thinks I'm coming of as an ass for defending my ex's family to my wife and that it sends the \"wrong message\".

First of all, she had absolutely no right to say what she said and where your son could hear, too. Not okay. One bad apple doesn't mean the whole family is trash. Also, assuming that someone with tattoos means you're unemployed is a very dated mindset. Most people now a days have tattoos. My extremely Mormon family has tattoos, and they're insanely successful. I'm heavily tatted, and so is my immediate family, and we are all employed and not living in a trailer park. Even if we were who the hell cares? As long as you have a roof over your head and food in the fridge, you're doing just fine. \n\nAlso, the way that she blows up on you for putting her in her place is out of line.

You can tell her it\u2019s not ok to talk about your sons family that way and that it\u2019s disrespectful in front of others (and you should). But you should also show your son how to respect people even when they do bad/unacceptable things.", "NTA - it's ridiculous that people would equate tattoos  with trash in this day and age.  My sister is a specialised teacher and I work in IT, both with tattoos and coloured hair, both earning well over the national average for many years.

However, saying this in front of your child warrants a reprimand. She disrespected your child and his family right in front of him and he is not old enough to adequately defend or advocate for himself.

You\u2019re a great parent.", "I'm gonna go with NTA because I don't think just leaving it to discuss later in private is an option. Your wife disrespected your sons mother in front of other people, and you needed to speak up. That said, it's a razor-sharp edge (very difficult) to call her out on it without being insulting right back to her. If all you condemned is her comments / choice of words, then I think you are in the ethical \"right\" here. But I get her being mad. Don't hold your breath that she will apologize to you or even walk back her comments, but maybe won't feel brazen enough to try that again since you spke yp about it.\n\nAnd hopefully she realizes that badmouthing people unnecessary is not something you get a free pass on just because it's an ex.", "NTA, sometimes people need to be humbled in the moment.

Good fathers are a rare commodity, keep it up king", "YTA! Respect your wife,  even when she's wrong.  Pull her aside without causing notice if you can't use visual cues to shut her down.  \n   She has to be your number one loyalty.

And again? She knows she'll get a tut tut and that's all. Calling out bad public behavior (from anyone) is a lot like correcting a child or a pet when the action happens. Remembered much better. It has the benefit of also letting everyone else know your position on those words and that you won't stand idly by when someone feels like spewing them. At one point I was going to take someone aside and have a chat, but he just kept at it. Nuke. He kept his mouth shut after that. I guess he ruined the chances of anyone else having me show leniency in time and place when their words were chosen in that time and place.", "NTA your wife made herself look bad", "ETH\n\nYes, your wife stuck her foot in her mouth, but you are her teammate and partner.

If anyone called my child trailer trash, I would kick them to the curb so fast their head couldn't stop spinning. As for your brother, he clearly has his head so far up his ass that he's becoming an asshole. I feel so angry on your behalf. Has she said things like that about your ex, her family, and your son before? How does she act around your son? Is she civil with your ex if she's around her? Or is she cold and trying to push your ex away? This is a major red flag, in my opinion. What if your son decides to get tattoos? Will she change how she treats him? If I was in your shoes, I'd be either sleeping at my parents' house or a friend's couch. I don't think I could have slept next to her. I'd need space for a few days to think and process my emotions. OP your wife and brother owe you, your son, your ex and your exs family an apology. And tbh I'd make her apologize in person and let her tell them what she said. She's your sons step mom, not some 16 year old spreading gossip about some poor girl because the guy she likes is dating, said poor girl. She may not need to be his mom, but she can't say shit like that. What if your son overheard her? How would that make him feel not only about himself but how it would affect his trust in her.

You can\u2019t hate a person that gave you something that you love in my opinion. \n\nYes defending her in public may give off a bad image however anyone that truly knows you and the backstory should have an understanding that it\u2019s not coming from having feelings for her but from a place of appreciation for what she and her family have done for you.

That the new wife/step-mom is supposed to hate the ex-wife/bio-mom and create all this unnecessary drama?

Further, your wife was not only disrespecting your ex-wife, she was disrespectful of your son. \n\nIt's unfortunate that your wife chose to bend over and show her whole asshole in front of company, but part of healthy discourse is being able to courteously disagree with each other no matter who is present. For what it's worth I do think that \"I can't believe you just said that\" is leaning towards public admonishment which isn't great, something like \"I disagree, my experience with my son's and ex-wife's family is bla bla bla\" would be better in company and still get the message across that she's put her foot in it until you can discuss it deeper in private.

That was my first and only cue to pass on the whole dude. It didn\u2019t ever make me feel better to hear a past partner disparaged, and it said soooo much more about the man than the ex! Discussing genuine challenges or traumatic experiences within a past relationship is a completely different thing, obviously, but it\u2019s the *intent* with which it is shared that matters. Putting someone else down to feel better about themselves or to sway other people\u2019s perception of them vs genuinely sharing hard-won life lessons\u2026 perspective and accountability are key, and people who are so insecure in themselves that they need to take digs at the people *they chose* to be in relationship with? No thank you very much!", "Yeah. This. I'm kinda thinking OP under reacted. I'd of lost it. \n\nIs this a pattern with her?", "Yeah your reaction was correct.

You're also forming an opinion right there that since some members of his family have been in prison and live in trailers, he must have badmouthed them.

What messages do you think he gets from her, both directly and indirectly, and how do you supposed they affect his self-esteem?
