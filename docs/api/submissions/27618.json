Up until this point I had no issues with them. Young couple, no kids, large dog that barks no more or less than any other dog. About a week ago they started painting the fence between our properties. I happen to know the fence is on MY property so they had no right to paint it. \n\nI went back and forth on whether I should say or do anything. At first I thought maybe it wasn\u2019t such a big deal. They were only painting the side facing their lot. However as it turned out they were doing that in preparation for painting their house PINK. The rest of the houses in this neighborhood are regular house colors. Grey. white. Tan. It looks god awful. \r\n\nThis just didn\u2019t sit well with me so I went over and told them that the fence they painted is actually MY fence on MY property. They were slack jawed and mumbled \u201cok\u201d and so I said you\u2019re going to fix it, right? They said they \u201cdidn\u2019t know how\u201d and asked if it was \u201creally that big a deal.\u201d I told them fine, why not just let me come onto THEIR property and mess around with THEIR things?\r  \n\r  \nThen they asked me why I didn\u2019t say something before they were finished and I told them that it isn\u2019t my job to do their research for them. That they should have known better when they got the land survey done at inspection. They said they \u201cwaived inspection\u201d which again, it\u2019s not my fault.\r  \n\r  \nThey asked how they could fix this and keep the fence the color they\u2019d chosen as it would mean one side of the fence wouldn\u2019t match the others. I said tough shit, it\u2019s not my problem. I told them that I would be kind and give them the weekend to fix the fence.

Yes, you should've told them while they were painting it. Why didn't you? Well, as you yourself say, \"maybe it wasn't such a big deal.\" Seems the real issue is the color of the house. That's when you started complaining.\n\nYTA. Saying things like they \"should've researched\" and \"tough shit\" and giving them until the weekend to fix it. You sound really punitive and unforgiving.\n\nAre you like this with your other neighbors? I wonder what they really think about you.\n\nApologize to your neighbor. Agree with them that you should've said something before. \\*Apologize about how unpleasant you were.\\* See if you can find some color that would work for both of you (white? that goes well with pink). Maybe go so far as to help pay for the paint (because you said nothing before) and help them paint it.\n\nOtherwise...YTA.", "Why are you even asking this? Of course YTA, you had ample time to say something and only said something once they finished and you did not like the color of their house because they decided they did not want to fit into your little monochromatic world.  \n\n\nNot only are YTA, you also come across as being a total jerk and a totally unpleasant person. I feel sorry for your neighbors.", "YTA. You say yourself it wasn't a big deal to you...UNTIL they decided to paint their house a color you don't believe goes on houses.", "So glad you are not my neighbor.", "Of course YTA. What the hell is actually wrong with you? You should have told them as soon as you noticed it if you actually cared. Plus you\u2019re only really doing it to be an AH in the first  place because of something else. I\u2019d hate to live near you.", "Yep, you're the asshole. You didn't have an issue with them painting \"your\" fence until you decided you didn't like the colour they chose so stop trying to pass your assholery off as some sort of principled stance. And if the fence sits between the properties , then it's on the property line and they have the legal right to paint their side.\n\nEDIT: A land survey is not part of the inspection process so what are you on about? I hope they DO get a land survey done now because I can basically guarantee that your claim that the fence is on your property is bullshit.", "YTA.\n\nTotally not Ok they didn't bother checking and for sure they own that.\n\nYou opted to weaponize this bc you don't like the color their chose for \\*their\\* house - which doesn't your permission, BTW. If you had handled this with no malicious payback, you would have been totally in the right.", "YTA. You were happy to let them paint \"your property\" when you thought it'd be to your taste, which means you were ready to take advantage of them for your own benefit. \n\nYou only pulled the \"my property\" card when you didn't like the color, greatly inconveniencing them, causing them to spend extra money and time, and being a complete asshole about it to boot. \n\nYou are the definition of a shit neighbor and I hope they give you hell from now on, because you certainly started it.", "Of course YTA, that was your goal.", "YTA - they made an honest mistake, but you chose to wait until the fence was already painted before saying anything.", "YTA\n\nThis was clearly malicious since you had a week to say something and didn't.", "YTA, \n\nthey made a honest mistake.

You just said it wasn't such a big deal then house being \"PINK\" it was unacceptable ?", "YTA. And why is the color of someone's house bothering you that much? You'd hate me. Mine is a wicked bright teal with hot pink trim.", "YTA.  Jeez!  You purposely waited until they were done to drop the bomb and then gave them a deadline to fix it?  Yeah, not your job, but it's called being a good neighbor.  You should have told them just as soon as you saw it.", "YTA. Yes, they should have checked first, but that doesn't give you the right to go over to their house and lecture them like you're their abusive dad.", "They painted the side of your fence facing THEM. YTA and yk it. Just because you don't owe them a notice or FYI, doesn't mean you're not an AH.

At any moment you could have walked over and save them the trouble, but you chose not too. You even mentioned you had no issues with them up until this point, so at the first sign of trouble, you purposefully acted like an asshole.\n\nYou were being a petty asshole which you already knew, and I think you got what you deserved.

You are that person in the neighborhood.", "Yta  100%", "YTA, you didn't think it was a big deal until they decided to make THEIR property a color you didn't like.

Would you have said nothing if they painted their home a non-effeminate color?\n\nWhy do you get to delegate what\u2019s \u201cregular\u201d to them?", "YTA, shitty neighbor", "YTA. You are being petty and mean. Who cares if you do not like pink. I hope it is now going to be Neon Glow In The Dark Electric Pink.", "YTA.\nIf you had a problem with it, you should have said something as soon as you saw it. Instead you intentionally waited to tell them as to make their lives harder. Also, no one surveys property lines as part of a purchase inspection. They aren\u2019t even the same job.\n\nI can only imagine what would happen if a child hit a ball in your backyard. \n\nActually evil tbh.", "YTA. If it was a problem, you should have said so earlier, when you noticed it.", "YTA - You are a massive AH, but I am glad that you let your new neighbors know how much of a dick you are. I hope you never need any favors from them. Just wondering if any of your neighbors like you.", "your property, your problem.\n\nyou let them paint it. 'it wasn't such a big deal'.\n\nYou acquiesced to this by not informing them of it and by allowing them to complete it. Paint your own damn fence now. \n\nOh, and fuck you and your lawyer BC we all know this is going to be the thing you turn to now.\n\nYTA.", "Wow dude. You're just proud of your YTA status, huh?", "YTA because you could have said something much earlier.\n\nI'm sure we'll hear about you again on r/neighborsfromhell", "YTA what would you like them to do now?", "YTA\n\nWhy let them finish painting the fence if it was yours and you had an issue with it? At any time you could have stopped them but you let them waste their time and effort? You only complained bc it's a color you don't like. If i were them I wouldn't re-paint it", "YTA you just want to cause problems for them you dont actually care.", "YTA. If someone is painting your fence and you hate the color why would you let them continue? You'd stop them right away which you didn't.", "YTA How would you feel about your neighbors being petty assholes because they disagreed with how you decorated?", "Let\u2019s break this down.  You didn\u2019t say anything to them because you wanted to be TA.  Now you\u2019re wondering if YTA? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02", "YTA ,  YTA.  I would tell you to fuck off.  What are you going to do about it ? Do you want to fight with the neighbors the rest of your life ?  get therapy", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou knew they were messing with your property, and you let them continue.  If you wanted them to not paint it, you had plenty of time and opportunity to stop them.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to \u201cfix the fence\u201d - not in a week, not in a year.  It\u2019s *your* fence.  If you want it a certain color, *you* can paint it.", "YTA\n\nAnd you know it too. The only reason you said something is because you just don\u2019t like the finished product.", "YTA\n\nYou waited to tell them, then you have the nerve to be in a rush to let them fix it? \n\nLike, you obv could have told them before they finished so they could immediately go about correcting it.", "YTA. You could have told them when you saw them start painting. Either way it doesn't face your property it faces theirs. So what's the big deal? They didn't go on your property and paint the side you see. Also, when you buy a home and even with inspection, you aren't always told where your property lines are. This may be their first home purchased and you just gave them bad neighbor vibes. Not a good way to start off because it could lead to worse situations. Pick your battles wisely. I would let it go and apologize for over reacting", "YTA. You are petty  and power tripping. You just made life your home very uncomfortable for you all.", "Yta, it was a simple mistake to make", "YTA \n\nYour personality is as riveting as watching paint dry.", "YTA", "YTA and you're lucky they seem like pushovers cause I would have just laughed in your face.", "YTA. You are a bully. This is a young couple, you have spoiled their enjoyment of their home. YTA", "Fix it yourself asshole. Holy fuck you're ridiculous. YTA.", "YTA Any half-decent person would have told them as soon as you saw them start painting.", "The fuck? Of course YTA. It would take not even two minutes to say \u201chey btw it\u2019s on my property\u201d instead they wasted money and time and now you expect them to spend more time and money fixing it? You seemed totally fine until they painted their house.", "You\u2019re an asshole. I\u2019m glad you aren\u2019t my neighbor.", "YTA. You knew what they were doing. You knew full well and you let them spend money and time doing it. And you only decided to do something when you realised they were going to paint THEIR house a colour YOU don\u2019t like. It\u2019s none of your business what colour they paint their house. I hope they make it pink and sparkly to be quite honest.", "YTA and it sounds like they'll have the prettiest house in the neighborhood \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77", "YTA, why are you making a huge deal with your neighbors?  If the fence isn't facing you and facing them, I don't understand why you are choosing to draw the line in the sand there.", "Should have stopped it if you knew it was your property. Definitely the asshole", "YTA for waiting until they had finished\u2026 however they should never have assumed the fence was theirs to paint. They should know where their property line is and, if unsure\u2026 ask!", "If you mean that they were only painting \"their\" side of the fence, as in the part that is facing their property, YTA. I could see how a reasonable person would assume that something facing their property, like a fence, would be theirs. Additionally, you saw them doing it, and said nothing. Then you got angry when they finished; you should have stopped them to begin with. \n\nIf you mean that they were painting both sides of the fence, ETA. They shouldn't have come over onto your property to paint that side of the fence; you should have warned them.", "Sounds like YTA. You let them crack on with it then gave them an attitude when they finished.", "YTA, and you're THAT neighbor", "Yes, YTA. No reason at all to go from 0 to 100 like you did.", "YTA. The houses on your street are only grey, white and tan? You're right, that DOES sound God awful. Thank goodness your new neighbors painted their house a fun and happy color! I bet it really brightens up your drab, ugly neighborhood. \n\nThey seem like fun people. You seem about as God awful as the rest of your neighborhood. What are you, a one man HOA?\n\nAs for painting the fence, who gives a shit? You don't have to look at the color everyday. You get to see the same old ugly fence that you always get to see (and you seem to like ugly, so that should make you happy!). This isn't something that hurts you at all, so let them be and shut your mouth. They're being perfectly nice neighbors, you're being a monstrous asshole.", "YTA - For letting them finish and then saying something.\n\nAlso, Judge Judy had a case exactly like this and she concluded that the owner had so case to force them to paint it back the way it was since it faced the neighbour\u2019s yard and they didn\u2019t have to look at it.", "YTA - You know that you should have said something when you first saw them painting the fence.", "YTA. And I hope the house is painted an even brighter shade of pink.", "YTA and you bloody well know it.", "INFO: Why the fuck do you care if their house is pink? It's not your fucking bouse.", "YTA. Of course you should have told them before they finished! And it sounds like you didn\u2019t even care- until they painted their house a color you didn\u2019t like.

Enjoy it.  But once the fence issue is sorted, I'm willing to bet you'll find something else to nit pick about.", "lol you sound like a profoundly huge asshole\n\nYTA\n\nleave your neighbors alone, dude. this doesn't affect you in the least", "Obviously YTA. Get over yourself", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a fence. And you don\u2019t have to look at the other side? Why do you care so much?

That the side of the (boundary?) fence you don't even see is a colour they like??", "YTA for not telling them and for your attitude towards them. Also, what is wrong with a pink house?", "Yep, YTA. You could have stopped them but didn\u2019t, and are only upset about it to begin with because you don\u2019t like their planned house color. Only once you found that out did you decide the fence was a problem.", "Is it because of the pink house or do you always have a chip on your shoulder?  YOU should have told them. You were very rude and they obviously wanted to try to fix it. YTA", "YTA\n\nAnd if you take them to court over it, you'll likely lose. You knew they were painting it. You knew it was your fence. By allowing it to continue, you gave them constructive permission. \n\nSo, you can tell them to repaint it all you want. But if they refuse, and you go to court, you'll MAYBE win a small portion of your lawsuit.", "YTA for watching them do a bunch of work you didnt mind until they painted their house. Yeah a pink house is not my cup of tea, but its their house and not yours so too bad.\n\nI dont know the jurisdiction you live in, but I would suggest that you look into your fence laws for the area. Many places have laws that if the fence is within a certain distance of the property line, it would be considered a shared fence. Thus you would be a even bigger AH if that is the case and you are trying to make them do more work that you are not entilted to make them do.", "YTA- you sound like a huge AH, ever heard of being neighborly? Being kind to your neighbors? Looking out for them? God I feel so bad for the people you live next to, neighbors are supposed to look out for each other", "YTA - you could have been a nice neighbour. You're not even mad about the fence. Its just an excuse to get in their face about something because you don't like the colour of their house - and you have no control over THAT. Glad you're not my neighbour", "YTA, if you knew it was your property and waited until they made you unhappy to say anything, you are TA.", "YTA my goodness.\n\nThe time to speak up, if it was really such an issue, was when you saw them labouring away.\n\nAnd what\u2019s your issue with pink houses, that you instantly turn into a crap neighbour when you see one? Pink houses are so normal, there are famous songs about them\u2014I give you [Malvina Reynolds](https://youtu.be/VUoXtddNPAM?feature=shared) and [John Mellencamp](https://youtu.be/qOfkpu6749w?feature=shared), for starters. Hell, my grandmother\u2019s house when I was a kid in Texas was pink clay brick with pink trim.\n\nIt sounds nice, to me. Cheerful and welcoming, a warm kindly wave amid all the grey and beige. Try opening your mind and being kinder.", "YTA for apparently making them repaint it, I\u2019m assuming? (Your post isn\u2019t super clear).

You only made it an issue when you didn\u2019t like their house colour. Your behaviour looks really spiteful.", "INFO. How can you even see their side of the fence? Am I missing something?", "Yeah, YTA. Why didn\u2019t you just take a huge dump on their front lawn as a way of welcoming them to your neighborhood? \n\nNot to mention, depending on your local laws, you may find that your failure to mitigate the damage to your fence while you still could may give you shared culpability.", "Yta", "YTA.

Up until this point I had no issues with them. Young couple, no kids, large dog that barks no more or less than any other dog. About a week ago they started painting the fence between our properties. I happen to know the fence is on MY property so they had no right to paint it. \n\nI went back and forth on whether I should say or do anything. At first I thought maybe it wasn\u2019t such a big deal. They were only painting the side facing their lot. However as it turned out they were doing that in preparation for painting their house PINK. The rest of the houses in this neighborhood are regular house colors. Grey. white. Tan. It looks god awful. \r\n\nThis just didn\u2019t sit well with me so I went over and told them that the fence they painted is actually MY fence on MY property. They were slack jawed and mumbled \u201cok\u201d and so I said you\u2019re going to fix it, right? They said they \u201cdidn\u2019t know how\u201d and asked if it was \u201creally that big a deal.\u201d I told them fine, why not just let me come onto THEIR property and mess around with THEIR things?\r  \n\r  \nThen they asked me why I didn\u2019t say something before they were finished and I told them that it isn\u2019t my job to do their research for them. That they should have known better when they got the land survey done at inspection. They said they \u201cwaived inspection\u201d which again, it\u2019s not my fault.\r  \n\r  \nThey asked how they could fix this and keep the fence the color they\u2019d chosen as it would mean one side of the fence wouldn\u2019t match the others. I said tough shit, it\u2019s not my problem. I told them that I would be kind and give them the weekend to fix the fence. AITA?\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I assumed (stupidly) that the previous owner must have had permission to plant it. I made certain to trim/prune the ivy to keep it in check.    \n\n\nOne late winter, I fell and broke my elbow badly - it was a displaced fracture and I had to have a plaster cast and wear a sling for a while.  I was still in plaster come early spring.  \n\n\nI concentrated on getting the ivy in shape. Using only one hand, I trimmed it until it looked really good - a beautiful job, though I say it myself. It looked like an emerald carpet. I noticed the neighbour watching from a window.  \n\n\nShe waited until I'd finished and then informed me that the ivy on the one wall was causing damp in her shed and she wanted it gone.  I have no issue with her telling me that. If the ivy was indeed causing damp, I wish she'd told me two years sooner: I wouldn't want to cause trouble. I do think that waiting for me to finish the damned job when I only had one good arm was spiteful.  \n\n\nI used one hand to haul it all off, but couldn't cut it off at the roots with one hand. (I was single at the time and I'm fairly strong for a woman, but I couldn't manage - was nearly in tears trying.) In desperation, I phoned a friend. He came up with a hedge trimmer and cut across the base for me and I applied weedkiller.  \n\n\nThere was also a tall cotoneaster hedge at the boundary - all roots on my side and just inside a boundary fence.   \n\n\nOnce my arm had recovered, I trimmed the top of the hedge and then trimmed all my side until it was beautiful. I then squeezed my fat ass between the other side of the hedge and the boundary fence. (I don't know how I managed it, but I was fairly determined.) I pruned the hedge back to bare wood on my neighbour's side.   \n\n\nShe and her family arrived home. I then heard: \"Who done that!? What a mess! Who the hell done that?\"  \n\n\nPetty, but it still gives me a warm glow.  (Yes, it grew back.
