We spent a good chunk of that decade inseperable! We lived together, worked together a few times, and told each other everything! We\u2019ve both been in solid relationships for a while now and both recently got engaged. Exciting to be engaged at the same time, right? Wrong. She got engaged in mid-September 2023, and I got engaged mid-October 2023 (two completely different ways, if that\u2019s important). For the short month that she was a fianc\u00e9 and I wasn\u2019t, I was very hands on and helped where I could with anything she asked. We had planned to go dress shopping in the next state over, she asked me to be her MOH, and was overall her soundboard. When I got engaged, her response was \u201cabout time!\u201d making it seem like she was excited for us! Within a month, she uninvited me to dress shopping, stopped asking me questions or for help, informed me that she chose a different MOH, and basically stopped talking to me. I made attempts to reach out and ask how things are going, how life was, or opinions of certain ideas I was debating for my own wedding. When my FH and I decided on a date, we took into account her wedding date to ensure it wasn\u2019t too close to hers. Hers was 2 and a half months before ours was, and hers was a destination wedding, where ours was in the next town over. Plenty of time IMO. We were trying to \u201crush\u201d our wedding due to ill family members who were important to us to have there. Once she found out our date, she proceeded to throw a tantrum that we were trying to \u201csteal her spotlight\u201d. I had already booked our venue by that time, so I simply apologized that she felt that way, that it wasn\u2019t the intention. She stopped replying to me again, and we haven\u2019t talked since then (that was roughly 2 months ago). Today, she posted on social media that she had changed her wedding date for undisclosed reasons\u2026the weekend after our wedding. For someone who threw a fit about our 2.5 month gap was too short, she really threw that idea out the window. With the toxic behaviors that have been exhibited over the last 3 months, I was debating taking her and her fianc\u00e9 off the guest list. The last thing I want at my wedding is unnecessary drama.

She's been acting like a mega A-H for several weeks. What good could possibly come from having her as a guest (that's assuming she would even show up) at your wedding?", "Why would you even want her there?  Id be worried she'd try some shit.", "INFO: Depends. Do you WANT to re-establish the friendship after all the marriage frenzy is over?", "NTA. Weddings bring out the absolute worst in people. I would uninvite her and end the friendship now.", "If you're not speaking to each other, why would you invite her?\n\nNTA and congrats - enjoy your drama-free wedding. Then sit back and watch her cut off all the people who dare to get pregnant the same year she does", "NTA. It appears that she's threatened by you upstaging her wedding and wedding plans. Which is a bizarre way to think unless you're a jealous, insecure person. I had friends get married a month before me and a cousin the week after and I never gave it a thought. But then I also don't think the world revolves around me and I don't compare myself to others. It's not a competition, and if she sees it that way, then perhaps it's better to uninvite her. Especilly if you know her well enough to suspect she's capable of pulling shenanigans. I'd say making you un-MOH was enough of a vibe.", "NTA, she's weird and needs to go. Have her photo and have security so they can't let her in", "NTA, that\u2019s ridiculous. \nOne of my good friends and I got married three weeks apart each other, and we were in each others bridal parties. Only assholes make a big deal about stuff like that.", "She is not your friend at all.", "NTA. There are some who think they should have a wedding year, not just the day. IMHO it\u2019s gotten out of hand. If you reflect you\u2019ll probably think of other instances where she\u2019s exhibited similar behaviour.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
