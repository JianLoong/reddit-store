TLDR: My ex-wife demands I provide more child support due to her moving to a much more expensive location and I said no.\n\nMy ex and I divorced in 2015, we had four kids together. I was active military and she was a stay at home mom. It made sense for the kids to stay with her, I was subject to fairly often work trips. Our state (WA) has a formula to determine child support and I offered to pay more than the state required ($1500).\n\nA few months later, I met my girlfriend on eHarmony (we married in 2017). Things went ok for the next year or so, but as always happens in the military, I was transferred to a different state. This required a change in the parenting plan, we mutually agreed (without going to court to officially change it).\n\nThis seemed to work out ok. In early 2018, she (my ex) let me know she was struggling financially and was having a difficult time finding a job while having the kids full-time. I agreed to take them for the \u201918-\u201919 school year, so she could work full-time on finding a good job. Also during this time, I continued to pay her half the amount of my child support ($750) so she could continue to keep the house. It was not easy, but I never asked her for any money during this time.\n\nFast forward to 2020, I have retired from the military and moved back to the area to be close to the kids. Note that my ex gets a portion (27%) of that retirement for the rest of her life (which I believe she\u2019s entitled to).\n\nFrom 2020-2022, things seem pretty good. I live 20 minutes away and often visit her house to help watch the kids for work or medical reasons.\n\nShe lived in a roughish area, and decided to get a job in a city 40 minutes away and made the decision to move closer to her job. After the move, she emails me demanding that I pay her more in child support due to the increased mortgage. She was super condescending and demanding. I told her no, saying her decision to move to more expensive area was her decision and I was not financially responsible for that decision. She reacted by saying I was never allowed in her house ever again and that she \u201cdidn\u2019t need me and never did.\u201d And we\u2019ve lived in this detente for the next year.\n\nFast forward again to this month, and I get another email (also during my weekend with the kids). Saying she has to replace the roof of her house; which will cost $16k which she will have to finance. She requested (not demanded this time) that I increase my financial support. The email was filled with guilt trips and never acknowledges the way I\u2019ve supported her in the past. She proceeded to give a break down of her finances. She believes I should be responsible for 40% of her mortgage, car payments, and groceries. Her mortgage is $2500/mo and one of her car payments (lease) is $540/mo!\n\nAm I the asshole for telling her I\u2019m not responsible for her poor financial decisions? Should I offer to take on the kids full-time?\n\nEdit 1: WA state changed its CS laws in 2017(?) which if I put in the numbers correctly (not knowing her income) I think I'd owe 1700/mo.
