I think this behavior is rather controlling and narcissistic. He knew going into the relationship I smoked; if he doesn\u2019t want me to smoke inside his house he pays rent for that I live in; I can understand that. I don\u2019t understand why I need to give that up completely just bc he doesn\u2019t do it. I find 0 drug tolerance to be some lame shit honestly. Also no secrets between us is crazy. Nothing is a secret but there are something\u2019s you talk to family, and/ or friends about not a partner. Church every Sunday is something I will never ever ever ever do as long as I live, I thank God for another day everyday, I could do church 1 Sunday a month. However shoving that down someone\u2019s throat is just overwhelming. As for the vaping I actually stopped doing that bc I didn\u2019t like that much about myself either. \nAfter giving it some thought I just told my bf we should break up bc I can\u2019t be the girl he needs me to be. My bf called me an asshole for not wanting to better myself for our relationship. Half my family think this is the change I need while the other think he is just trying to control and initiate power in the relationship.

What he's asking you to do is not \"better yourself,\" he's wanting you to change your habits entirely to fit HIS wants. Honestly, if you smoke/vape and don't go to church, and those are absolute musts for him, he shouldn't have started dating you in the first place. While I'd agree that drug use can be an issue, if you handle yourself responsibly or are on your OWN path to cleaning up, that's YOUR choice. The ONLY thing I'd say is warranted on his list is having no secrets, but even that (having only been in the relationship a short time) comes with the condition that you are ready to divulge certain details you might be insecure about sharing for whatever reasons that are entirely your own.\n\nNTA, dump this loser and if he MUST have a church mouse girlfriend he can go find one who already goes to church.", "NTA run for your life.

That led me to quit smoking weed entirely because I decided I'd rather be with her than high. Imo that's a reasonable approach.\n\n\nComing at you with a list of demands including weekly church attendance is fuckin nuts and I think a sign of a control freak and a bigtime red flag.\n\n\nI hesitate to say break up but yeesh.

But doesnt say that, doesn't include any details about what drugs he's referring to or the if the fights had to do with that", "NTA\n\nI'm wondering does he even like you? He's asking you to not just change habits that he knew about beforehand, but to change who you are physically and aspects of your personality.\n\nYou're better off just moving on to someone who won't attempt to control your life", "NTA\u2026 almost NAH, I can appreciate MOST of what is on his list as dealbreakers in a partner\u2026\n\nBut the mandatory church? That makes him the asshole.", "NAH\n\nIf you don't agree with it, dump him and move on. I am not trying to justify him giving any kind of ultimatum or telling you how to live your life. But he is allowed to have specific requirements for the type of person he wants to date, just as you are allowed to think his requirements are stupid. The fact that you are posting this tells me that you 2 are incompatible, but I wont fault him either simply for having a different set of standards. Everyone is entitled to find what makes them happy. Time for you both to do that I think.", "ESH\nYou are just incompatible  and just break up, because if you guys are unwilling to compromise, and both parties are unhappy in the relationship, it just might be best to break up.", "NTA and you know that lol get off Reddit and dump him", "You two are not compatible. NTA.  If you \u201cbetter yourself\u201d for any of his demands he\u2019ll keep pressuring you to change more.", "I was just going to make that comment!  You beat me to it!", ">(get this) become a lawyer so he could sue his ex wife.\n\nWow! Sounds like the plot of a bad comedy film", "^[Sokka-Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/user/SokkaHaikuBot/comments/153gt2c/what_is_a_sokka_haiku/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ^by ^TheSrr:\n\n*NTA and*\n\n*You know that lol get*\n\n*Off Reddit and dump him*\n\n---\n^Remember ^that ^one ^time ^Sokka ^accidentally ^used ^an ^extra ^syllable ^in ^that ^Haiku ^Battle ^in ^Ba ^Sing ^Se? ^That ^was ^a ^Sokka ^Haiku ^and ^you ^just ^made ^one.", "The thing is, I was not in university, I was not planning to go to university, and I had never expressed any interest in being a lawyer. \n\nPeople, I tell you.", ">If those are boundaries, they need to be established at the start and the person probably shouldn't start relationships with people who don't fit them.\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment here, there is no practical way to do this. When you first start dating there is now way to truly know someone, that takes time. And anyone who shows up on a first date with a list of dos and don't will be dropped before the coffee gets to the table. It would be nice if we could all just be honest with ourselves and each other. Unfortunately that is not how the world works.", "Dropping ultimatum conditions six months in isn't exactly a good look either. You don't need to necessarily trauma dump on a first date with your whole \"Must not\" list, but a \"first date\" also doesn't mean you're suddenly a couple. If your hard line is \"Goes to church and doesn't smoke weed,\" and you don't know after two dates where they stand on those, you're not paying attention to your date. It's as easy as asking \"Hey what church do you go to? Oh you don't go to one.\" And then boom, you know they're not what you're looking for. Not stringing someone along for half a year before laying out a list of conditions for your affection.", "Agreed. But again, this is assuming that the person you are dating is the same person they will be down the road. You almost never see the real person until much much later. Most people will wear a mask and try to project a \"more perfect\" image of themselves for a very long time. Having said that, I do agree about nailing down your hardline requirements off the bat. Best to filter early and not waste each other's time.", "True people do kinda mask themselves, though I doubt someone who smokes anything with any degree of regularity can hide it from a partner for 6 months unless the partner is really obtuse. Of course, that's one specific example. Things like how well they maintain their house might be easier to mask because people often panic-clean when expecting company.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like some crazy cult business", "NTA - ick. ICK. ICKKKK. Run girl.", "NTA\n\nYou guys are only together for 6 months. It turned out you are not compatible. Happens.  Breaking up was the right move. \n\nSure, maybe some stuff on this list doesn't sound bad, but your family is wrong in assuming him forcing these changes on you will be good for you. As long you don't actually want these things, you are not gonna change, so this would not end well.", "Striving to be the best version of yourself is a worthy endeavor. Striving to be what *someone else* thinks you should be is a recipe for self-loathing and invitation for abuse. Tell this loser your first step in bettering yourself is dumping him.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "Sounds like he is too good for you. You should leave him and just go have a fun life he is focused on being healthy and you aren\u2019t.", "NTA. Show him your list :)", "NTA\n\nOne of the demands sounds like he wants you to stop taking your prescription medication. This is appalling. Why would that be \u201cbettering\u201d yourself in any way?\n\nThe whole appearing with a list of demands for you to obey is appalling, but that in in particular was very WTAF.\n\nHe\u2019s a controlling jerk. Leave him.", "This.", "It\u2019s really not, it sounds like a really bad situation and I\u2019m glad you got out of it.\n\nKudos for you for holding your ground and standing up for yourself. You\u2019re not some project for him to fix. The fact that he gave you a list of things about yourself that he decided you need to fix is cringeworthy and a giant neon red flag.\n\nHe\u2019s trying to force you to go to church, quit any habits he doesn\u2019t approve of and make you exercise (what the hell) and is demanding you have no secrets from him (I really doubt that goes two ways). \n\nThis is so creepy: he\u2019s trying to take control of you mentally, physically and spiritually.\n\nHe\u2019s basically chipping away at every part of your autonomy.\n\nCreepy cringy. NTA you dodged a bullet. Send him back to mommy (clearly he\u2019s gonna go crying to her anyway- she can just keep him.)\n\nAlso it\u2019s your life. You try things and realize they\u2019re not what you thought or not what you need. Neither the real estate job or the relationship were what you needed out of life. You realized it and you moved on.\n\nThat\u2019s the most intelligent, healthy thing you can do. Not doing that Is how you get stuck in the sunk cost fallacy. It\u2019s how people get stuck in crappy marriages or crappy jobs and you get to thinking you put too much into this to just let it go but it just turns into basically beating a dead horse. \n\nSometimes in life you need to see reality and let things go. Good on you for facing reality and being true to yourself.", "Adderall must be prescribed by a physician as it is a Schedule II controlled substance . It is not an over-the-counter drug if that is what you are alluding to. \n\nOnce a diagnosis has been made, and the diagnosis can be made by a GP, the prescription can be written by either her primary care physician or her psychiatrist. \n\nOP has been prescribed this medication to help mitigate a medical condition and her bf, who more than likely does not have a medical degree, has no place demanding she stop taking this medication."]}
