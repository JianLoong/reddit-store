If your folks are problematic, or awful - that's not your fault or your responsibility to fix BUT you need to be straight with your BF about your reasoning.

Not to mention that sometimes, depending on the divorce, other parent and the parenting plan, skipping it can cause custody issues later. AND the kids probably KNOW this is their time with dad and would feel abandoned if he punted being with them for you. Maybe don't spend this holiday with him if you feel the kids won't enjoy it.

I understand now why most men I tried to meet would want to be \"just friends\" after one date, when they learned I had a toddler.  Eventually I gave up and didn't date at all until my son was around 15 and had moved in with his dad.  I met my now-husband and on our first date he asked if I was certain I did not want any more children. And he asked about my (then) current custody / visitation schedule and conflicts with my son's dad.  Only after a few dates and no \"kid emergencies\" did he really believe me that we were drama-free at that point. \n\nMy husband never had any kids and I am so glad I didn't have to deal with any of the visitation / custody/ support/ head games/ drama!!

There is an adjustment process,  and it takes at least a bit of time. This applies no less to kids than to a person's other relatives and friends, their pets,  or their own mental health or medical issues.  These are things you need time to think on,  and a month or less is seldom enough.  A kid is a bigger commitment than a lot of these.

You have to understand that his kids will always be more important to him than you will ever be.\n\nIt is very possible that he could be interpreting this to be the first (or one of the first) attempts to remove or deprioritize his kids from his life. And if I were him, I would be reconsidering this relationship. \n\nIf my wife made this type of suggestion to me or I to her about her kids, it would not have ended well.", "YTA for asking a father to forgo his turn with his kids at Christmas. I\u2019m guessing he will have to wait 2 years to get another chance to spend Christmas with them and it is selfish of you to think he should prioritize an 11 month long relationship over his holiday time with his children. You are not in the right mindset to date a man with kids and a custody arrangement.", "YTA\n\nYou are clearly not prepared to date someone with children and should not be dating them if you can\u2019t understand that 1 - they come first and 2 - when splitting custody time that time you get with them is precious.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing \u201cstressful\u201d enough about a first holiday with a significant other\u2019s family that would justify not having your children with you. It sounds very much like you just don\u2019t want to deal with them and want this holiday focused on the two of you as it\u2019s your first. Which is incredibly telling about how your relationship with his kids would be going forward and he should heed that warning.", "Yta- you guys haven\u2019t even been together a year.", "Yep. Asking him to prioritize OP over his children and give up Christmas with his children means OP is totally the AH.\n\nThis isn't about him being comfortable. This is about OP being comfortable and making things more comfortable for her family at the expense of his children.", "Even if distance is an issue, living in the 21st century means virtual gatherings are an option prior to traveling to meet in person.", "Yes. I stopped dating guys with kids under 18 a LONG time ago. I don't do ex wife/babymama nonsense, I don't have the energy for the who is going where for what holiday saga, and I am not trying to watch my language, my clothing, what I put on the TV....etc.", "Even so, it should be wildly obvious that he wants to spend Christmas with his kids. Youth isn\u2019t an excuse.", "I get the same vibe. If bf has an 11 year old and OP has no kids, either there\u2019s a significant age difference, OP has been pretty committed to not having kids, or bf had them very young. Any or all of which can be fine, but introduce extra elements to juggle which OP isn\u2019t handling well.", "I was similar, but mostly because of the other parent. lol  I was a stepchild, so I would never treat a child badly no matter what. But I wasn't down for the ex wife thing.", "My family is the same way towards my step children! \ud83e\udd70", "I was the opposite when I was dating. I have a daughter and didn\u2019t want to have to deal with blending a family. I was pretty upfront about it though and my current partner was cool with it.", "Is that not a common complaint of people who are trying to date and also have kids? Is that not something that, if this sentiment was shared in a slightly different context, would get downvoted rather than praised?", "Honestly if for some reason I ended up single, I wouldn\u2019t date someone with kid(s) despite having one myself. Blended families can be a complete nightmare and I have no interest in that. I also think I\u2019d be a shitty stepmom so better to not inflict that on innocent kids. Thankfully I don\u2019t have to worry about it but idk how people do it", "Never heard that complaint when I was a single parent dating and I\u2019ve never heard it from any single friends.\n\nAspects of dating are harder when you have children - but no one I know wants to date someone who doesn\u2019t want to be there.", "It was the best choice I could have made tbh. I also think I would have been a terrible step-mother. I love my own children but often struggle to have patience with other peoples for long stretches. \n\nI have a partner and we now have a shared baby and he relishes the \u201cstep dad\u201d role without being over-bearing and my older daughter adores her new sister. So I think I made the right choice.", "I love other people\u2019s kids in small doses. But my daughter is autistic and her needs would always come before any other child. I know I couldn\u2019t balance being a good stepmom & making sure her needs are met. \n\nI\u2019m glad it\u2019s worked out with your partner and growing family!", "I unfortunately had an evil stepmother situation, so I watch like a hawk for this stuff. In this case, OP \"suggested\" that the kids do Christmas with their mom while OP and BF spend time with her own family.", "YTA. \n\nYou say you want him to be comfortable around your family, but he says he\u2019s fine. So the question is - who are you *really* trying to make comfortable? You? Your family?\n\nAs others have said, he and his children are a package deal. You shouldn\u2019t be trying to separate them at Christmas, a time when he probably misses them the most when it\u2019s not his year. \n\nWhen you tell him you don\u2019t want his kids there, he hears that you don\u2019t want an important part of him. I\u2019d be angry, too. \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with this, I\u2019d recommend not bringing him to your family gathering, with it without the kids.

I'm so glad he knows he only has so many Christmas holidays to spend with them. Don't waste a moment.\n\nYTA.", "YTA and your boyfriend will be one if he stays with you.  You are not stepmother material, and he should be putting his children first.", "Yta, huge. His kids>you, always. Don't be with a man with kids. Clearly you aren't ready for it.", "YTA.\n\nCompletely.\n\nIf anything, kids that age (especially the 7yo) are the PERFECT buffer. They would keep your family minding their Ps&Qs, while also giving your BF something positive to talk about/switch the conversation to if things got awkward.\n\nIf he still is your BF after this, I certainly wouldn't be.", "YTA, at least that is how he sees it, I think I see why. This sounds more like you were worried about your comfort, not his.", "YTA. Good parents want to spend all of their holidays with their children. You only get so many while they\u2019re still little. Suggesting that he give up his turn to have his kids for Christmas makes you look immature and insensitive. Definitely not good step parent material. If my current husband had suggested such a thing about my then 4 year old son while we were dating, I would\u2019ve dumped him.", "YTA. You're not ready to be a stepmom. Let this man go if he hasn't realized for himself who you really are yet.", "What you should have said and what he\u2019d probably would of liked to hear was, \u201cI\u2019d love for the kids to come too!\u201d \n\nAlso, don\u2019t try to change up his and the moms schedule with the kids, don\u2019t be that person.", "You\u2019re def the ah on this one.", "Sorry OP, but YTA. \n\nI totally get why he feels that way. There's no real justification for asking him to exclude his children. He's met your family before, why does Christmas matter, in that it wouldn't be a good idea to bring the kids? No legitimate reason was given for asking him to miss an important occasion with his children.", "YTA. I get not feeling comfy enough to have them come to your family\u2019s for Christmas but you suggesting he seriously spend Christmas away from his kids on his year to have them is ridiculous. Go to your family\u2019s alone if you want or spend it with bf and his kids. The suggestion that he should go with you without his kids is insane.", "YTA. What about your bf take his kids to hit parents for christmas, then the kids also get to spend time with their grandparents, then you can take your bf to your family next year. Then you can either choose to come with your bf or celebrate with your family.   \nI agree that it's a bad idea to bring his kids to your parents, since it will also be a whole new situation for them and probably uncomfortable for them, but of course your bf should spend the christmas with his kids.   \nAnd like you don't have to spend christmas together. Me and my bf doesn't even spend christmas eve together and we've been together for 5 years. We usually spend the 23th at my dad and the 25th at his parents house. It's okay to spend christmas apart even if you're a couple. It's usually another thing if you have children together with your significant other, but that's not the case here", "Yeah, he's right! Maybe he can spend Christmas with his kids & you go to your parents & then meet up that afternoon/evening. Just a suggestion....", "YTA, you should have asked what he wanted or apologized for the suggestion instead of digging your heels in trying to justify it so that it escalated into an argument. C\u2019mon, you\u2019re the one dating him, you\u2019ve gotta know that a parent will always prioritize their children", "They're his kids, and he doesn't get to see them all the time.  It would have been torture for me as a parent to have to live with my young children only occasionally; I wouldn't give up a single second of my allotted visitation schedule.  This is none of OP's business.\n\nYTA", "YTA... apologize. Children ALWAYS COME FIRST... especially at Christmas. That was a horrible suggestion, you will probably be single by new year", "This Christmas should be all about those kids, not you. YTA.", "YTA. If he alternated christmases with his ex, you\u2019re not just asking him to give up one Christmas\u2014you\u2019re asking him to go THREE christmases without celebrating with his kids. The last time he celebrated with them, they were 9 and 5, and at the next they\u2019d be 13 and 9. Expecting him to lose that much time with his kids is horrific.", "YTA for simply overstepping that boundary especially after 11 months are u outta ya mind??", "I totally agree, this is also why I would never date a guy with kids. I understand that if you are with someone with kids you have kids. My step mother never wanted kids, she met my dad though when my brother and I were still young and made the choice to be with someone with kids. She was (and is) AMAZING!\n\nFrom never wanting kids to understanding that her life would now revolve around us. We lived with mum but stayed separately every second weekend at Dad\u2019s so she had a kid, then teenager, in her house EVERY weekend as we grew up. And dad always committed to that time with us. \n\nThey were both very busy professionals so this would have been the main time they had to spend together and it was always kids first, plus a dinner with us all mid week, which she always cooked (she\u2019s an amazing cook) and put up with all our fussy eating / moods / years of utter unappreciated hard work all parents have to go through. \n\nNow as adults we\u2019ve spoken about it and while we are very very close (she is my third parent) but she\u2019s always made it clear to me that it\u2019s all in or not at all.", "You said everything I was thinking, wAAY more nicely than I did!", "> OP needs to realize that there are likely just seven more Christmases with the eldest child at home, which means since he is splitting holidays then there are THREE/FOUR left for him. And only 5-6 with the youngest.\n\nOn top of that, this could be the last magical Christmas with the oldest. They're still a kid now, but they'll be well on their way to being a mopey teenager by the next time OP's BF has them at Christmas.", "Lol, well thank you kindly regardless!", "Same. I decided after my divorce that I would not date anyone with children; it's a personal choice, I'm not passing a judgement. I didn't want my son to deal with stepsiblings, and I didn't want to be in a co-parenting situation. I have nothing but respect for those who make it work, but as this subreddit demonstrates every night, a lot of people can't, or don't wish to.", "Bingo. I'm not their parent, nor am I going to act like I am.", ">I had an awful evil stepmother situation myself, so I've always had a bit of a dream of being a stepmother myself (especially as I don't want biological children)\n\nI have been vigilant when dating because I'd NEVER want to expose my son to that situation. I broke up with my last partner because she just couldn't grasp that my son was important and that his needs always came ahead of someone else's wants and whims. She was also super jealous of the time I spent with him.", "Isn't that insane? Like we sent her flowers on her wedding day, each baby she's had we sent flowers from our family and made sure we took our son out to buy baby gifts plus every individual birthday and holiday we send a gift for his other siblings, mom and stepdad. But damn she is so unnecessary mean (no idea why as she's remarried with 4 more kids too, he didn't fight for the house or good car and was awarded 50/50 custody, we did not cheat we got together a year later) and mean to me for zero reason besides I married her ex that SHE chose to divorce. I have always respected her as his mom and never over stepped my boundaries. Her and her mom and siblings are horrid people. His stepdad is a great guy and her kids are so sweet (they always have a big hug waiting for me and my husband) but she is too much. It makes her even more mad when we smile at her lol.", "She sounds like a great woman who accepted the responsibility of helping raise her husband's children.", "I have just imagined your parents like spoil-hungry trolls taking bunches of candies and putting them inside the mouths of a few confused kids and honestly, that\u2019s an amazing fantasy.", "We all have different but the same narrative. In our case, bio mom is negligent and emotionally abusive to my stepson. So my husband and I got him into therapy. The therapist (and previous doctors) have called cps many times (13 times in 9 years) but because she's mom and it's not \"bad enough\" (literally what cps told us), they won't do anything. \n\nShe pretends I don't exist except for when she has to communicate with me, which is fine by me, and makes me laugh because I'm more involved than she ever has been and when she and my ss get into it (which is often), I don't just take her side or his side. \n\nFor me, it's others who make comments. Even things like \"you knew what you were getting into\" are so invalidating and wrong! I married a man with split custody whose ex was fairly ok minus a few things.

They literally told us \"it's not ideal and this isn't great but she's the mom so we trust she knows what's best.\" Obviously not.
