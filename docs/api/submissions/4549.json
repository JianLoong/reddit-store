Yes it\u2019s too early for his kids to meet your parents and no, Christmas is not the right venue to introduce them.

And honestly, if he'd come to that conclusion himself, I'd say that should warrant you losing respect for him.\n\nEither you don't understand what parenting is about or you don't GAF about his kids.

Good luck .", "YTA - He's a divorced dad, it's his Christmas with his kids, why on Earth would he consider spending it without them, and to ask that of him is appalling. Just because there is potential for an awkward interaction doesn't mean that the kids couldn't handle it. \n\nYou need to understand that his kids come first, a lot of men don't get the opportunity to have their kids like this, and you need to be fully supportive of this. Suggestion or not, it should not have even been a question.", "I\u2019m going with YTA. I\u2019m assuming they have alternate Christmas with the kids?

Never try and come between a parent and their children, they should always come first.", "NAH, taking this at face value: if you really meant to keep the kids from witnessing their dad feel excluded or isolated in supposed new family, then the suggestion was well intentioned (albiet pessimistic, why are you going to bat over the fact he would fumble? don't you trust him to be sociable? or is this a problem with YOUR family...) \n\nbut he's justified in feeling hurt and expressing that to you. you would benefit from having some empathy here and understanding why he's hurt. step-children are sensitive topics as historically they are not treated well by step-family. take this fact into context when talking to him about them and appreciate how much he cares for his children.", "As a single dad....YTA.  Anytime you want to exclude my kids from anything is a giant red flag.  Kids ALWAYS come first.  If its his holiday then he shouldn't be giving them up.

If your folks are problematic, or awful - that's not your fault or your responsibility to fix BUT you need to be straight with your BF about your reasoning.  'Make everybody comfortable' comes off as you just not wanting his kids around and THAT is showing up like a red flag to him that you don't see his kids as being a hugely important part of his life.\n\nIf they are generally big hearted folks who like kids? Then perhaps YOU are stressing out over nothing.", "Let's not pretend your suggestion has anything to do with you worrying about him feeling stressed to spend Christmas with your parents. It's completely about your comfort, let's be real. If anything, especially given his reaction, having his kids there would probably put him more at ease.

YTA.", "YTA, they have a parenting plan, it\u2019s his turn this year to have the kids for Christmas. Maybe you can sit out Christmas with your family this year and go next year.

And to round off the hypocrisy, you\u2019re trying to sell this as something that would benefit him. No thought whatsoever to the kids. \n\nDating someone with kids isn\u2019t for everyone. So put your thinking cap on to decide if it\u2019s for you because this way of thinking is not ok.", "NTA for suggesting he doesn\u2019t bring the kids. They do not need to meet their dad\u2019s gf\u2019s family on a major holiday this soon (no offense). Maybe next year. If he has the kids good for him for having his priority be spending it with them. You should go to your family\u2019s christmas and give space for him and the kids to have a special morning just them. I\u2019m tagging him as the AH because he shouldn\u2019t be pushing for the kids to meet your fam when it\u2019s been less than a year. It should have been a boundary he set, not you.", "YTA,  all I read a was a my family, my family!!! \nI wish he had posted\u2026 run sir run", "YTA. Kids always come first, especially on holidays that are only an every-other-year thing. \n\nBut what I want to know is this: Why would your family have an issue with his children being there? If having kids and bringing them to your family\u2019s party is somehow going to cause awkwardness or hostility, then why would he want to go anyway?", "NTA\n\nThe many joys of dating someone with kids\u2026..smh", "YTA. His kids come before you.", "YTA - Kids aren't just a matter of convenience, you don't toss them aside for a day because it could be awkward. This year is his Christmas, he wants to spend it with his kids. If you're serious about the guy then his kids are going to meet your family at some point aren't they?", "YTA  for suggesting he not see his kids on Christmas.", "uh, her lane is who is invited to dinner at her parents.", "Holy cow, are you for real?  They are HIS KIDS.  And it's his year to have christmas with them!  No matter where he goes, they should also be welcome!", "And OPs partner is the kids family too he is there father after all and by that definition since they aren\u2019t married then he\u2019s not OPs family and why doesn\u2019t she just go to her family by herself!", "OP's suggestion was not reasonable.", "Absolutely. This is why people should think long and hard before dating a person with children. I personally would never date a woman with children. Others feel differently. But a parent must always consider their children first so if a person elects to date a person with kids they must accept it.", "She's dating someone with children she wants nothing to do with.", "This is exactly it. YTA, OP.", "Yup, and that totem pole will never change.", "BS.  It's malicious AF to even suggest such a thing.  It literally shows OP has no clue that the kids come first.  \n\nAnd how would the bf even handle the question from HER parents...  \"Oh you have kids?  Why didn't you bring them along?\" \n\n\"Oh because your daughter thought I shouldn't.\"\n\nWhat person with any decency would look well upon that?!", "Some of the a holes are so transparent. YTA", "or OP knows that her family is a bunch of  hard-asses that will be judgmental and cold to the BF as is let alone with 2 kids in tow. If it's something like that she needs to come to terms with where her family is on the Difficult scale and be straight with her BF.  it's still wrong for her to ask him to dump the kids on Christmas but at least he might have a better understanding as to why she's so worried about his.", "I don't think op was fighting for him to take the suggestion I think the whole fight seems to just be him being insulted by the suggestion.", "OP could have set up a video meeting in advance so that their first meeting wasn't on christmas.\n\nBoom.  Solved.", "He gets the kids every other Christmas and this is his Christmas, oc he should put the kids first, as should she.", "As he should.", "She shouldn\u2019t be suggesting any activity that doesn\u2019t involve his kids.", "Yeah that's what it sounds like for sure. Instead of trying to think of ways to incorporate fun and maybe new traditions with the kids, she's trying to shuffle them off to their mother.", "Ok", "As he should be.", "As a single dad, rightly so.", "Not disagreeing, but no need for him to be nasty about", "What? Patents with children go out occasionally without children. What's the big deal. Adults do need adult time.", "I hope this makes him realize they aren't compatible", "This is his custody arrangement with his kids, and he obviously values his time with them. The likelihood is that their mom has primary custody and he gets weekends and alternate holidays. This is important time.\n\nIf OP can't handle having his kids around, he shouldn't be coming to Christmas with her.", "Not when it\u2019s a holiday that he only gets to spend time with his kids every other year.", ">Patents with children go out occasionally without children.\n\nNot during Christmas!\n\n>Adults do need adult time.\n\nThen have \"adult time,\" and parent meet up after the holidays when the kids are back with mom.

He does not get his kids every Christmas.\n\nUnless a really really special occasion for her let\u2019s say a wedding event date and adult Things can be scheduled on his non custodial time.\n\nChristmas with her family could be scheduled next year when he doesn\u2019t have his kids.\n\nChristmas is a special family time most parents want to spend with their kids", "Yes that's true.  My parents did that from time to time.  But you know when they NEVER did that?\n\nChristmas day when I was still a minor.", "I don't think it had anything to do with her being unable to handle kids. That's NOT what she said.", "Sure, I understand. But thats not what the commenter said. I responded to the specific statement.", "I have 4.", "I get that. She merely made a suggestion thinking it would be easier on her BF. All he had to say was what you said. To make it into an argument was stupid.", "So you\u2019d dump your kids at Christmas?"]}
