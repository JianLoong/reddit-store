So I also encourage my kids to donate stuff.", "So why not donate stuff instead? Supposedly, the whole point was not having enough room for all of her things, not teaching her a life lesson. The kid is too younger to understand her mom is giving all of her stuff away.", "Can also be great grandparents.  At one point my kids had 6 grandmothers - my mother, my MIL, my mum's mother, my MILs mother, my FILs mother and her mother", "My SO has his parents, her mom's parents divorced and remarried enough times she has 3 sets (one of her stepmoms was there 20 years of her life so she still sees her despite another divorce), and now that her mom remarried she has his parents. They've jumped in and are acting like grandparents hardcore.", "Growing up I had 10 grandparents. My mom\u2019s mom, step dad, and dad, my dad\u2019s dad, step mom, and mom, my stepdad\u2019s mom and dad, and my step mom\u2019s mom and dad. Depending on how you define \u201cset\u201d, I think that comes out to 6 sets? Or 4 sets and 2 individual grandparents, but either way, 10 total", "The kid is absolutely able to understand that, you would be surprised how much kids can understand. The mother asked her if she was okay with giving away gifts, and let her decide what she wanted to give away. \n\nYou are pretty dense if you don't think the mother was teaching her about generosity.", "That's great, grandparents can be awesome.", "Used at law schools in commercial law classes as a generic product.", "Candle stick holder??", "Cold", "NTA \nToo often kids have way more than they actually use. As long as she's content with this arrangement - and it sounds like she is--I see no problem with it. She sounds like she is enjoying sharing her bounty. On top of it you are teaching your child a valuable lesson. Props to you.", "How DARE you teach your daughter to be altruistic...foreshame.\n\nWhen my boys were quite young we had an annual adventure I'll call it.  They would typically get some money from grandparents, etc.  A week or so before Christmas I'd take the boys to the toy store and let them pick out some that we'll then say grandma and grandpa bought them.  Regardless of what they'd pick out, however, I insisted that they pick out a small present for a 'friend' who isn't having a Christmas.  Then we'd drive around to a toy donation place and I'd have the guys give the donations out.  Now...many years since, do they remember this?  Maybe...maybe not.  But in the moment, the smiles on their own faces told me they realized they were doing something good for some other child.", "NTA. My family has always done that sort of thing. Usually not with new presents though, unless we knew we weren't going to play with them. We would typically go through all our old toys and trash the broken things, donate the others.", "What kind of person throws a fit over his child happily learning to be generous? Your ex, apparently. NTA.", "NTA as long as your daughter\u2019s OK with it it shouldn\u2019t matter", "op=NTA-not quite\n\nBut what you should do is go through her older toys and belongings and let her choose what she doesn't want anymore.\n\nNot her new gifts.  And donating is one thing but having her gift it/them to one of YOUR nieces could be viewed side-eyed by more than your Ex.\n\nETA--Also be more firm about stuff staying and Grandma's and Dad's house.  As in you will not put it in your car, you will not allow it brought into your home. Be firm, then it is not your problem if they end up donating it because THEY don't want the clutter.", "NTA, does he really expect you to just buy a bigger place so you can store toys she'll play with for maybe a year or two?  You're teaching her a good lesson about sharing and charity and.....not being a hoarder I guess.  If he wants her to keep what they give her, they can rent her a storage unit or something", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s wonderful for you to be instilling these values into your daughter at an early age. They were also gifts so your daughter can do with them as she wishes. Good on you OP, you\u2019re raising your daughter correctly!", "Tell him he can keep the extra gifts at his place, or she can learn the joys of altruism - his choice.", "Next time send your daughter to his house with the toys.", "NTA.\n\nThe gifts were given **to** your daughter.  Your daughter could see that there were too many for her room/your home.  She loved the idea of sharing the extras, and even found people she wanted to do this with.  \n\n**A gift, once given, belongs to the person who received it.**   If they want to donate it or share it with a friend, **it's their decision.**  If they keep it and enjoy it, also their decision.  If they throw it away, also their choice. \\[My teens threw \"gifts\" from their abusive grandmother in the trash the last several times she sent something over.  As she took these things from her hoard, they were filthy and trash already.\\]\n\n**Gifts are not for keeping score.**  Your child doesn't have to keep every gift for as long as the giver wants, or use it how the giver wants.  **Once given to her, it's her choice what she does with it.**   If other people make demands on your child for what she does with her gifts, then these things aren't actually gifts, but something else.", "Depends. Are you giving away THIS year's gifts, or just simply going through the toys she doesn't use anymore? That is critical to this", "INFO: Does she call you Mommy Dearest?", "OP made a mistake in acceding to the demand that she take all of daughter's gifts home with her, notwithstanding that she has no room for them. \"Sorry, ex, I'm not taking them home, our daughter will look forward to playing with them here.\"\n\nBut the demand that she get a bigger place so as to accommodate the ridonkulous amounts of cr&p that her ex gives her daughter is hilarious. I've heard of being eaten out of hearth and home, but not forced out by externally-imposed hoarding.\n\nThere is no end to the nonsensical creativity of humans.", "Precisely. Plus sounds as though she\u2019s giving away new, unused items as opposed to older things\u2026 how large can a paint set be? Also, I wonder if  op is using it as an excuse to diminish the amount of stuff from her ex\u2019s side.", "Why would it be fucked up to live in a smaller place.  Kids don't need mansions, they don't need a bunch of plastic shit taking up space, they need love and shelter.  A small flat that is big enough for two is perfectly fine.  There is no reason why she needs all this crap.  Kids that get this much crap don't value the things they have and often don't even play with it.  The mother is doing the right thing.", "But who wants to clean up that much stuff.  So OP would need a housecleaner on weekly basis to deal with mess.", "I use to be so jealous of big family's. I had no one but mom and lil brother.", "The glass dishes that Gu desserts come in, would be my guess.\n\nETA: [these gorgeous treats - with glass dishes that seem so useful no one is able to throw them away, even though at most 3 get used at one time. Except for DIY weddings.](https://gudesserts.com)", "I actually was too! Despite aforementioned plethora of grandparents, because of familial relationships, distance, etc, for many years, my holidays would be like, 4 people at most. I think this year, on actual Christmas Day, it will just be me, my mom, and step dad. I think one brother will come by the week after, I won\u2019t see any of my other siblings though. Sort of a small family vibe even though there\u2019s technically a lot of members.", "I had to Google this to figure out what they were. So not those.\n\nCold", "Utensil crock?", "Umbrella holder? Cake stand? \n\nYou\u2019ve utterly vexed me and my husband with this lol"]}
