{"id": 30636, "submission_id": "17rgpgj", "title": "AITA for refusing to change my daughter's clothes at a birthday party?", "selftext": "I (34F) have two kids (8M & 4F). My daughter's name is Aurora. My husband (36M) and I chose that name because it was slightly similar to my late FIL's, and worked well with our last names. It had nothing to do with the princess from *Sleeping Beauty*. In spite of that, we've had fun with that movie in the past, and ever since my daughter realized that she shared names with a Disney character, Princess Aurora has been her favorite.\n\nOur family went to Disney World in July, and while there, we bought my daughter a Princess Aurora costume. She adores it, and wears it whenever she has the chance.\n\nTwo weeks ago, one of Aurora's friends from school threw a princess-themed birthday party. She encouraged her friends to wear costumes. My daughter wanted to go as her favorite character, which didn't surprise me at all.\n\nWhen we got to the party, the birthday girl came to greet my daughter, and she was also dressed as Princess Aurora. I didn't know what her costume was going to be prior to the party.\n\nI got worried for a second, but the birthday girl was actually really excited. She said that they looked like twins. It was adorable. They ran off to play and I forgot about the costumes for a while.\n\nAbout 30 minutes into the party, I was at a table with some of the other moms when the birthday girl's mother came up to me. She asked if I had brought any spare clothes for Aurora. I said yes (I always bring an extra shirt and shorts for her). She then asked me to change my daughter into the spare clothes and out of her costume.\n\nThe mother explained that she'd hired a photographer to walk around taking pictures of the kids, and was also planning on getting a group photo near the end of the party. She didn't want anyone wearing the same costume as her daughter in these pictures. She also thought her daughter might get jealous, since my kid gets to share her name with their favorite princess.\n\nNow, if the birthday girl was the one who had a problem, I might've considered changing Aurora into her spare clothes. But no, she was genuinely excited they were dressed the same. It also didn't feel fair to force my daughter to be the only one without a costume in a party full of children in princess dresses.\n\nI said no and explained my reasoning to the girl's mom. She insisted for a few minutes, but I held my ground. Some of the other moms started to back me up, and she eventually got up and left.\n\nWhen I went to pick up my kids earlier this week, I ran into her friend's mom. She accused me of ruining her daughter's party by allowing Aurora to wear the same costume as her. She told me she doesn't think she'll ever be able to look at the pictures without being disgusted by my behavior.\n\nI thought she was exaggerating, but I'm starting to doubt myself. Our conflict has found its way to the mom group chat we're both in, and opinions over there are divided. Some think having two girls wear the same costume is no big deal, others think I should have changed my daughter's clothes.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699547046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rgpgj/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_daughters_clothes/", "score": 8067, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's the little girl's special day, if she was bummed and wanted to be the ONLY princess Aurora? Understandable to a point, and maybe just let her have what she wants on her birthday.  \n\n\nAn entitled mom who just has to have pictures a certain way?

Parents suck.  \n\n\nNTA.", "If she was so insistent that no one else be dressed as Aurora, why wouldn't she specify that when she sent out invites? \n\nNTA, it sounds to me like another example of a Mom wanting her little angel to be the only special one. I mean, I get that it's the kids birthday party. But it was a princess party. Your daughter dressed up as a princess. If there was nothing indicated not to dress as that specific princess than you did nothing wrong. This is on that mother and her own expectations.", "Oh. You have got to be kidding. You are really NTA here.\n\nThat mom...what a piece of work!! Jealous that a 4 year old is going to outshine her precious? Gross. Gross and terrible behavior on her part, she should be ashamed.\n\nI think it's adorable the birthday girl was so excited that another \"Aurora\" showed up!  Good job standing your ground. NOBODY PUTS BABY IN THE CORNER, lol.\n\nETA: That mom has some issues she needs to sort out, lol. Wow.", "NTA for two reasons, 1. You didn't know about the mom not wanting anyone dressed as the same princess as the birthday girl and 2. The birthday girl was excited that they were dressed similar.

NTA.  And have to wonder had there been other princess twins if it was expected no duplicate outfits period. The woman is the one with the problem.

While I think saying, \u201cThe birthday girl is going to be Aurora, so don\u2019t choose that costume\u201d does seem silly, it\u2019s the only way to avoid such a thing. If you choose not to make that rule known, you don\u2019t get to demand a little girl take off her princess dress and be the only one at a princess party who is not a princess. When you add in that the birthday girl was super cool about matching, the mother is insane.

I'm sorry that she continues to make this a big deal and the mom group is divided.\n\nIf it were me, in the group chat I would just say \"I'm sorry if my not changing my daughter's clothes upset you but her friend was very happy to have her in thr same dress and my little one was happy and having fun. I didn't think it would be fair to have my daughter the only one of her friends to not be in costume. It seemed as though all the kids had a great time and the birthday party was a lot of fun. I really hope we can move past this and not let it affect the kids friendships.

It was a princess themed party with costumes encouraged, and it doesn't sound like the mom said her daughter was going to be Aurora so please pick a different princess.

She liked it.\n\nBasically; you didn\u2019t ruin the party. You ruined the image of what the party was meant to be for the mother. First and foremost parties are for kids, not parents. So if the kid enjoyed it; success. Parents who use kids parties to try and accomplish their own goals/designs in favour of their own kids enjoyment are just the worst. Like the parents who will book out an event their own kid doesn\u2019t really enjoy just to show other parents how much money they have etc. when the kid would have been happier with a cheap ice cream party or something.", "NTA. \n\nThis mom *might\u2019ve* had a slight leg to stand on if she specifically requested no one dress their kid as Aurora.

It wouldn't be too much of a surprise if more than one Elsa showed up, for example.

If mom wanted her daughter to have a unique costume at her party, she should have mentioned this beforehand so you could get another costume for your kid. Also I don't think your daughter has dibs on the Aurora costume, but if you throw a princess party and invite someone with a princess name, it is highly likely they are going to dress up as that princess. So idk what she was expecting, but she could have prevented this very easily by talking to you before the party.", "NTA. The only person who thinks the birthday party was ruined is that mom.

I\u2019m sure it would be nice for people to easily pick out the birthday girl without having double Aurora\u2019s in every photo.

My daughter's name is Aurora. My husband (36M) and I chose that name because it was slightly similar to my late FIL's, and worked well with our last names. It had nothing to do with the princess from *Sleeping Beauty*. In spite of that, we've had fun with that movie in the past, and ever since my daughter realized that she shared names with a Disney character, Princess Aurora has been her favorite.\n\nOur family went to Disney World in July, and while there, we bought my daughter a Princess Aurora costume. She adores it, and wears it whenever she has the chance.\n\nTwo weeks ago, one of Aurora's friends from school threw a princess-themed birthday party. She encouraged her friends to wear costumes. My daughter wanted to go as her favorite character, which didn't surprise me at all.\n\nWhen we got to the party, the birthday girl came to greet my daughter, and she was also dressed as Princess Aurora. I didn't know what her costume was going to be prior to the party.\n\nI got worried for a second, but the birthday girl was actually really excited. She said that they looked like twins. It was adorable. They ran off to play and I forgot about the costumes for a while.\n\nAbout 30 minutes into the party, I was at a table with some of the other moms when the birthday girl's mother came up to me. She asked if I had brought any spare clothes for Aurora. I said yes (I always bring an extra shirt and shorts for her). She then asked me to change my daughter into the spare clothes and out of her costume.\n\nThe mother explained that she'd hired a photographer to walk around taking pictures of the kids, and was also planning on getting a group photo near the end of the party. She didn't want anyone wearing the same costume as her daughter in these pictures. She also thought her daughter might get jealous, since my kid gets to share her name with their favorite princess.\n\nNow, if the birthday girl was the one who had a problem, I might've considered changing Aurora into her spare clothes. But no, she was genuinely excited they were dressed the same. It also didn't feel fair to force my daughter to be the only one without a costume in a party full of children in princess dresses.\n\nI said no and explained my reasoning to the girl's mom. She insisted for a few minutes, but I held my ground. Some of the other moms started to back me up, and she eventually got up and left.\n\nWhen I went to pick up my kids earlier this week, I ran into her friend's mom. She accused me of ruining her daughter's party by allowing Aurora to wear the same costume as her. She told me she doesn't think she'll ever be able to look at the pictures without being disgusted by my behavior.\n\nI thought she was exaggerating, but I'm starting to doubt myself. Our conflict has found its way to the mom group chat we're both in, and opinions over there are divided. Some think having two girls wear the same costume is no big deal, others think I should have changed my daughter's clothes.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm assuming here, but I know my niece -- who is sweet and very willing to do things to make her friends happy -- would be upset if she was asked to take off a costume at a costume party and wear normal clothes while everyone else continued to be dressed up as princesses. And I think I'd get somewhere with her if I said that the birthday girl was sad about them having the same costume -- but since the birthday girl very clearly didn't care, it would be such a hard sell. There would probably be tears, and feelings of injustice (which I find young kids really struggle to process) and it would create all this drama with the kids. \n\nSo in that scenario, I'd want the drama to be between the adults.

The mom should have explicitly stated in the invite that the Aurora costume was reserved for the bday girl.  \n\nAnd at the very least, why didn't that mom offer a different dress to wear?  When my girls were that age, they had multiple costumes, when friends were over it was a constant princess parade.  \n\nI can't imagine how OP's daughter would have felt being the only girl in regular clothes at a princess party, I can't believe that was the expectation of this mom.", "This EXACTLY this .simply state the birthday girl has chosen princess Aurora on the invite .most have enough common sense not to duplicate ....the mom was rude ..but in today's \" Selfie\" society her behavior is becoming the norm to some ...", "That's exactly what I was thinking.
