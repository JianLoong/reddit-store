Making good livable money, but nothing ridiculous and I'm currently saving for a house deposit with my long-term girlfriend. I've always been quite a high achieving person and this was done mostly because my parents were VERY pushy with me. They would always sign me up to everything under the sun: acting classes, music lessons, a whole host of sports, public speaking competitions etc. Academically I excelled but always felt very pressured by my parents into what were 'acceptable' and 'unnaceptable' courses to pursue\n\nI graduated university in 2021 just at the tail end of the COVID Pandemic. I moved back in with my parents but immediately things felt tense as they were straight away hounding me to get a job and every day came a new lecture about how it was good to find my independence and move out. I kind of rushed into a teaching job which moved me across the country far away from my parents and I've been living entirely financially and physically independent for 2 years and able to save good money doing it\n\nIn the two years I've been away my father's company has struggled, my younger brother has started going to private school (something I never got) and my mother has become heavily disabled with a medical condition leaving her mostly bedridden\n\n6 months ago I asked to move back in for a year so I could save some money on renting to fully save for a deposit. My parents agreed and told me I wouldn't need to pay any rent at all\n\nThen two weeks ago I get another call, saying that when I move back i'd need to pay full rental price matched to what I'm currently paying in my own place. This is about \u00a3650 a month for a room in a shared house. This was alarming to me as I only have 4 weeks before I move back now and this has been a bit of a blow to my saving plans. My parents have revealed to me that they are really struggling to pay the mortgage now that mum isn't working and that they don't want to give up sending my brother to private school. They may start defaulting on their mortgage without me\n\nIt's clear my parents are struggling with depression and I've watched them slip further and further into alcoholism. Every time I've gone back home on the last two years the amount of wine I see them both get through is worrying.  \n\nSo, this week, I told them I no longer had any intention to move back in and that with the money I was going to rent my own place near them and continue to live independently. This has NOT gone down well and now I'm being held up in front of the family as a villain for abandoning my parents in their time of need. \n\nAm I the asshole for deciding now to preserve my own independence rather than help my parents with their finances?", "created_utc": 1687214046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dt0e1/aita_for_not_moving_back_home_to_help_my_parents/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they are making the choice to send your brother to private school over paying the mortgage, I don't think you want to be anywhere close to that financial disaster.

Had they told you this at the outset you would have said no. They were trying to force you into it, you stood your ground. Good for you", "NTA it would be one thing if they were totally transparent and asked this of you in the first place but to switch the terms without an open discussion is different. \n\nDon't abandon them but have an open honest discussion.", "NTA.  They do not want you to help with their mortgage, they want you to heavily subsidize your brother's private schooling.  If they are really pressed financially, your brother should switch to a state school, a move that would probably save them between 15-20 thousand pounds a year. \n\n(Canadian so I am only guessing at the cost of private UK school).", "NTA\n\nThey pushed for your independence, and are paying for schooling for your sibling, that you weren't given. This is where you need to hang on to that independence. \n\nIf they can't afford his school, that's a decision they have to handle.", "NTA. Look, I get you want to help your family because you love them and care for them but they are not your responsibility. Especially when they clearly want to continue living their current lifestyle (private school) and not make any concessions that could better their financial situation. It. Is. Not. Your. Responsibility. They are not your responsibility. They are trying to take advantage of you and your financial status, please don\u2019t let them. \n\nIt sounds like they need to take kid out of private school and find other ways to make changes so they can afford their living expenses. They should not guilt you into doing anything, especially moving home and footing the bill for them. I\u2019m sorry for their circumstances, but it sounds like they need a major reality check because they\u2019re still living like they were when they had a larger income.

So no, you can help, but never move back.", "NTA - but the issue here is to talk to your brother.\n\nYou don't say how old he is but your comment 'something I never got' tells me your not fully his big bro. If your seeing the alcoholism when you visit, what's it like to live there? Sounds like there are other choices your parents could make, but you probably have to work together to stop the wheels coming off, or the mortgage defaulting", "NTA - if they asked you with advance notice, that would be one thing. \n\nBur here they tried to more or less trick you into covering their mortgage.", "NTA - It\u2019s a sad situation and it\u2019s unfortunate that your parents are struggling with the mortgage but putting yourself, your plans and possibly your gf in financial difficulties is not good for anyone. If anything happens then your parents can\u2019t help you since their struggling themselves.", "If you move back in now, you\u2019ll never be able to move out again. Until they solve their financial priorities, they\u2019ll continue to be in crisis and expecting you to bail them out. Help if you feel the need, but it would be perfectly fine to set conditions on your help; for example, private school for brother, then they need to downsize their home and get a more manageable mortgage or if they want to keep their current home then private school has to go. It\u2019s not your responsibility to help them live beyond their means.  Any flying monkeys they send your way are welcome to contribute to this mess. In fact, offer to match whatever they contribute to help your parents \u201cin their time of need.\u201d  They likely won\u2019t, which would make them villains as well.", "NTA - they can stop drinking and put your brother in public school", "NTA. They pushed you away and now want you back despite their previous actions. Their options seem to be to enroll your brother in public school or to default on their mortgage. Either way, you have no obligation to pay them anything, especially after they went back on their word.", "NTA\n\nIf you moved back in, there's a good chance that it wouldn't just be rent they want.  Your parents are spending beyond their means.  Until they cut out excess spending (private school), you shouldn't give them money.", "NTA. The parents didn\u2019t hesitate to shove you out of their nest two years ago. I can help your parents with their finances : they can sell the house, take the younger kid out of private school and quit spending so much money on alcohol. Now I\u2019ve let my harsh out, it seems your parents need your help but this bait and switch, do-what-we-say approach is darned offensive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Was stated originally but the post was over the word limit so had to cut some context. The school my brother got placed in is a terrible, terrible school for a state school, and that's not me just saying that, it's pretty notorious. The state school I went to was much better but the catchment zone shrunk so our house was now no longer included in it and was nod picked up by the worse school.

Private school obviously is a luxury they can\u2019t afford right now but they are still in a fantasy land about the realities now.. Alcohol abuse is pouring gasoline on this fire. Keep working, save as much as you can, talk to your brother to work really hard in school, and if they end up waiting to lose their house before declaring bankruptcy due to the medical bills, I\u2019m sorry. You could help them negotiate d the medical bills away down but research a lot of strategies first.. Senior services. Look up Dave Ramsey and bankruptcy info if you are in the US to start getting yourself educated now in case they end up there. You might be in a position then to help your brother get thru college /have  a safe place to live, if they continue to spiral. Start researching scholarships and schools on his behalf.
