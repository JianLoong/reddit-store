My friend works at a private school and a lot of children receive subsidised fees and financial support.", "NTA get your own place and don\u2019t work at their company! You can\u2019t help them if you are drowning to.", "NTA they are so unfair. So you did not get the chance to go to a private school. But since your parents wants your brother in they will make you pay for his school because it is what it is. You will pay for you brother tuition.\n\nThey can go f themselves go nc and live your best life.", "NTA\n\nYou were moving back to save money, not support them. Your independence is more important. Don't go near them. They'll make get financially stuck so u never leave.", "NTA they can take your brother out of private school to pay the mortgage.", "To give some benefit of the doubt to the parents: there have been multiple rises in interest rates in the UK over the past year, which has caused major problems for anyone not on a fixed-rate mortgage (or who whose fixed rate has recently come to an end), and getting disability benefits in the UK is a whole mess thanks to years of austerity governments. So the problems are likely not entirely of their making.\n\nThe private school thing, though, is definitely a luxury they can't afford.", "Private schools vary a lot in the UK. Could be anywhere from about 10 grand to 50 grand a year!", "Yep, I have an alcoholic in the family, the amount of money he could save if he stopped drinking is quite impressive", "I think you should add this to your original post somehow, it's an important detail", "They were trying to force you into it, you stood your ground. Good for you", "OP is not moving back in, so that's a good start on boundaries.", "So you didn't read to the end of the post, then.", "Op is asking how to keep up with guilt wracking his brain to move in, I gave him the alternative of what moving back in would most likely look like.", "Yes because I get the feeling if he did move in, they'd make it very difficult for him to move out again.", "NTA. But I might be biased as I'm currently in a somewhat but also very different situation. I feel bad for them but I need to do what I have to do to make it. My parents were able to understand that. I'm sorry yours can't. Try not to feel too bad. They have options, they just aren't willing to take them because they are putting your brother's education above you", "NTA. If you are about to default on your mortgage, you are not in a position to send your child to a private school.\n\nIt is no way OP\u2019s job to help their parents financially, especially if they aren\u2019t trying to help themselves!", "You are an adult and you want to live an adult life. You were willing to sacrifice your independence to be able to save - and paying some rent is not unreasonable - but they want you to move in for what it would cost you to get your own place. \n\nUnfortunately your parents need to cut their cloth accordingly. It sounds like private school is out of their budget. NTA", "Cost depends on what school, low end mainstream public school is around \u00a32500 a term but for disabled students and high end it\u2019s around \u00a350k annually as a starter and goes up from there depending on which school.", "\"However if they are alright to live with, it's worth considering that it still will be cheaper - a) you could negotiate on rent and b) with bills, food, etc, living with family is still cheaper than living alone even if you nominally spend the same rent and the money stays in the family instead of going to a landlord.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is NOT cheaper, because they will ask for money all the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Landlords are LESS greedy than OP's parents - OP will get an appartment for what his parents want for a room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot living with the parents is worth MUCH MORE. **Much better for OP to stay in the appartment, and for the parents to sell the house and move to something smaller, too. OR: they can take in some other housemate.**"]}
