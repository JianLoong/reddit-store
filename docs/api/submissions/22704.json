This  house is the stuff of picture postcards \u2014 a lovely Victorian-era home  with a view of the sea. It has been in our family for generations, and  it holds an immense amount of sentimental value for all of us,  particularly for my younger brother, Ben (31M).\n\nSince  we were children, Ben has always been enchanted by that house. He'd  spend hours exploring every nook and cranny, daydreaming about the life  he'd lead there. As we grew older, his dream never wavered \u2014 he wanted  to live in that house.\n\nWhen our  grandmother's will was read, it turned out she had left the house to me.  I was living in the city, happily settled with my own family and  career. Ben, on the other hand, was still living paycheck to paycheck,  constantly in between jobs, and often borrowing money from our parents  or me.\n\nSeeing the state of the  house after our grandmother's passing, it was clear it needed serious  renovation. There were issues with the plumbing, the roof needed  repairs, and the old wiring was a safety hazard. All these renovations  were necessary to make the house habitable, and they would cost a  significant amount of money. Money that Ben didn't have and I wasn't in a  position to provide without jeopardizing my own family's financial  stability.\n\nTaking all this into  account, I deciding selling the house was the best option. The housing  market was favorable, and we stood to make a considerable profit from  the sale. My plan was to split the money equally. I wasn't in dire need  of all the money as we lived somewhat comfortable and this way, Ben  would have a substantial amount to clear his debts and could rent or  even buy a smaller place where he could start afresh.\n\nBen  proposed I sold the house to him at a considerably lower price than the  market value. I declined this offer as the amount he was offering was significantly less and almost all of his savings leaving very little  left in terms of living costs and expenses. I told him that it wasn't a  good idea for him, nor was it beneficial to me and my family, whereas  selling it for a much higher value on the open market and splitting the  money with him, meant we both walk away much more financially stable.\n\nBen  was heartbroken and accused me of betraying him and selling off his  dream. I tried to explain my perspective, that it was for his own good,  but he saw it as me being pragmatic at the cost of his feelings. He  stopped talking to me, and the rest of our family took his side saying I was selfish. \n\nThis whole  situation has left me riddled with guilt. I never wanted to upset Ben,  but I genuinely believed \u2014 and still believe \u2014 that selling the house  was in our best interest, especially his.", "created_utc": 1689831622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154i4ob/aita_for_selling_my_late_grandmothers_house/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he told you the house was more important then the money he would get and you disregarded that because, obviously you know better, that makes you TA. Which makes what you did ultimately come down to betraying your brother for the money you got for selling the house.

Brother then has to pay to renovate it.  \n\n> If you want something to assume about, wonder why the grandmother didn\u2019t give the house to the brother if he was so in love with it.\n\nBecause she assumed the OP could do math.  He had the financial stability to sit on the property for a bit.   The brother didn't.  OP should have been compensated for waiting, then the brother provide him with the same funds he would have gotten from the sale.  Everyone wins. OP gets the money he wanted with additional compensation for sitting on the property.   Brother gets several years to make the repairs.   \n\nThey could have a written out timeline where the brother has to meet and cover things or the house has to be sold.   If brother doesn't meet it, sell.  \n\nGrandmother really messed up.  She thought OP would value the family home for more than dollar value.   She should have picked the brother instead and left enough assets with him to cover property taxes for a while so he had time to work on it.", "I don\u2019t want to be your enemy because if this is how you talk to or about the people you suppose to love\u2026", "Op got the house... for free. What are you missing?", "OP's share of the house sale was probably less thanhis brother was offering. \"Below market\" sounds like a lot more money than \"less than half the value\"", "Dude go troll elsewhere.", "I'm not sure how I replied to your comment. Thought I was just commenting on the thread. Lol.", "Very location dependent. \n\nIn Ireland it's hell to repossess a house with a resident \"owner\" if they are making a gesture towards payment.\n\nMortgages are based on income as well as capital value of the property in 100% of cases.", "Perhaps in the US, though I don't know enough to know if it is true. I don't think in say European countries banks are looking to take on situations where they're likely to take on a house because the owner is unable to make the loan repayments. Theyre not loan sharks. Much as they may be perceived to be so.", "I don't buy the story at all, but I am with you.", "Pretty good point, I can see the logic after that example. But yes, his house his decision.", "Either way OP gets $50, but this way both get $50 and that $50 is going to be a lot more useful to the brother than a house he can't afford to maintain. And way less stress for OP. NTA.", "[removed]", "[deleted]", "OK, so you win the lottery, 100k after tax, someone from your family come to you \"hey I need 100k to buy my dream home, please give it to me.\"  \nDo you give it?", "Why would OP do that? If the brother's offered more than half the value, OP would get more money as he offered to split the sale price equally.", "So he crushed his brother's dream and got rid of a family treasure for generations to avoid the stress of thinking his brother *might* ask to borrow money someday?? A request he could just turn down? OP also never said anything about his brother ever borrowing money from him in the past", "No need for the shouting or adding religion into this with the amen.", "Are you dense? You can tell people the truth without acting like an asshole. If you cannot do that you are probably AN ASSHOLE.", "[deleted]", "I judged you from the comments you post here. And you seem like an asshole. \n\nNormal people can tell the truth without being an asshole to the people they suppose to move. Your comment showed that you would be a condescending asshole. I don\u2019t know how much more clearer I can make this."]}
