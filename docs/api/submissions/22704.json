This  house is the stuff of picture postcards \u2014 a lovely Victorian-era home  with a view of the sea. It has been in our family for generations, and  it holds an immense amount of sentimental value for all of us,  particularly for my younger brother, Ben (31M).\n\nSince  we were children, Ben has always been enchanted by that house. He'd  spend hours exploring every nook and cranny, daydreaming about the life  he'd lead there. As we grew older, his dream never wavered \u2014 he wanted  to live in that house.\n\nWhen our  grandmother's will was read, it turned out she had left the house to me.  I was living in the city, happily settled with my own family and  career. Ben, on the other hand, was still living paycheck to paycheck,  constantly in between jobs, and often borrowing money from our parents  or me.\n\nSeeing the state of the  house after our grandmother's passing, it was clear it needed serious  renovation. There were issues with the plumbing, the roof needed  repairs, and the old wiring was a safety hazard. All these renovations  were necessary to make the house habitable, and they would cost a  significant amount of money. Money that Ben didn't have and I wasn't in a  position to provide without jeopardizing my own family's financial  stability.\n\nTaking all this into  account, I deciding selling the house was the best option. The housing  market was favorable, and we stood to make a considerable profit from  the sale. My plan was to split the money equally. I wasn't in dire need  of all the money as we lived somewhat comfortable and this way, Ben  would have a substantial amount to clear his debts and could rent or  even buy a smaller place where he could start afresh.\n\nBen  proposed I sold the house to him at a considerably lower price than the  market value. I declined this offer as the amount he was offering was significantly less and almost all of his savings leaving very little  left in terms of living costs and expenses. I told him that it wasn't a  good idea for him, nor was it beneficial to me and my family, whereas  selling it for a much higher value on the open market and splitting the  money with him, meant we both walk away much more financially stable.\n\nBen  was heartbroken and accused me of betraying him and selling off his  dream. I tried to explain my perspective, that it was for his own good,  but he saw it as me being pragmatic at the cost of his feelings. He  stopped talking to me, and the rest of our family took his side saying I was selfish. \n\nThis whole  situation has left me riddled with guilt. I never wanted to upset Ben,  but I genuinely believed \u2014 and still believe \u2014 that selling the house  was in our best interest, especially his.", "created_utc": 1689831622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154i4ob/aita_for_selling_my_late_grandmothers_house/", "score": 6631, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he told you the house was more important then the money he would get and you disregarded that because, obviously you know better, that makes you TA.

He quits or gets fired from good paying jobs, has a wife that refuses to work but also has expensive tastes, has three kids who don\u2019t understand the value of a dollar, has a house way outside of his budget, and worst of all, mooched and conned (aka stole) literally *hundreds of thousands* of dollars from my grandparents over the decades. When my grandfather died, my uncle took advantage of my grandmother and her developing dementia; asking her for \u201cgas money\u201d, having her write him checks for his oldest daughter\u2019s college tuition numerous times, and after his youngest daughter committed suicide, used her death as a reason/excuse for his financial troubles for literally years after her death. And while I absolutely understand the huge toll that the death of a child has, he absolutely used her death as an excuse for everything. Any time my dad had simple questions about my grandmas finances, my uncle immediately went on the defensive and would say things like \u201cmy kid is dead, what am I supposed to do?\u201d and other manipulative things like that. Once my dad had power of attorney and had full control over my grandmothers bank account, he was alerted by the bank that they were suspicious of elder abuse. My grandmother had been writing checks out to my uncle so frequently that *the bank* noticed and was concerned. Long story short, my uncle was basically put on an allowance because while he was basically stealing her money, my grandmother wanted to pay for my cousin\u2019s college tuition as well as help my uncle out. She had wanted to do it ever since she was of sound mind so my dad agreed as long as he could set the allowance amount. Which he requested specific bill statements from my uncle so he could give him exactly how much was needed and not a penny more. \n\nWhen my grandmother passed away, the house was left to my dad. Me and my fianc\u00e9 had really wanted to eventually buy the house but we knew it just wasn\u2019t a possibility at that point in time. And my dad absolutely did not want to rent so we couldn\u2019t go that route either. When it came time to put the house on the market, there were a lot of things that needed fixing and updating. He paid for the necessary major repairs but when my uncle wanted to start doing legitimate remodeling in order to get a higher price, my dad said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and put the house on the market as it was. When it eventually sold, it ended up going for slightly less than the asking price, again, because of the necessary updating and minor repairs that it still needed. My dad was happy because he no longer had the headache of dealing with this house. My uncle was furious because he didn\u2019t get as much money as he was hoping. It led to a huge, nasty fight between our families and, while their relationship was strained to begin with, my dad and uncle no longer talk at all. My uncle is convinced that my dad sold the house for less to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d (guilty conscience?) and to just be a dick to him. Obviously that\u2019s not the case. Had my uncle lifted even a single finger to help with the house and my grandparents estate (instead of just trying to swindle and steal money) he would have realized the huge burden that house was. But all he wanted was money. And ultimately, like OP, it was my dads house and therefore, his decision.", "More likely that the rest of the family are making decisions based off of being sentimental rather the facts that house needs a whole ot of work, work that if the info about the brothers economy is true, the family will have to pay for.", "Yea why was renting out the house to him not an option? Ben uses his savings to finance the repairs and OP rents it to him until he can afford to buy it\u2026. OP did say he\u2019s not hard pressed for cash.", "Even if they made a deal OP will likely be guilted into it by everyone \"because family pay for family\" type BS.", "OP said his brother would've had little left of his savings after the amount he offered. That means he would've still had savings and likely isn't doing as bad as OP tried to make it seem. That and not having to pay rent means more money for renovations. OP is 100% TA.", "Exactly, the family got nothing it seems from the sale, and if the house was already sold the it sounds like the brother might not have even gotten the money from it. It was all about what OP wanted. No matter what dressing gets put on it.", "This.  Brother wanted a lottery ticket and was waiting around for someone to hand it to him.  NTA.", "Obviously yes, because he would have had to inherit it? Did you think that one though?", "Its his fucking house, he can set it on fire if he wants FFS.", "Boo hoo, as if you would give away a house to make someone's pipe dream come true. Actually, can I have your house?", "Right. That's not the only old Victorian house by the beach in the world", "I suspect we are 100% not getting the full story.", "A lot of times the elderly aren't as in touch with modern maintenance costs and planning, but they *are* in touch with the family gossip. Which means grandma likely knew OP was the smart, educated, \"good with money\" one while OP's brother is the black sheep. \n\nIt's possible grandma didn't have a preference, but knew OP would make the right decision for the financial future of their family.", ">That doesn't change whether what you're doing is right or acceptable. And trying to convince them to be not upset can often make them even more unhappy - it also gives them leverage if they realize you want them not to be upset. Sometimes you have to be ok with other people being upset for no good reason.\n\nThis is excellent. My husband is dealing with a very similar situation.", "What I don't get is that OP was willing to split the sale 50-50. So why not just sell the house at that split cost to the brother? OP would still make the same money in the end and the brother would have his dream house that he can fix up. I think the OP was the T.A because it just seemed like he didn't want his brother to have that house. \n\nI have two stories.. My uncle (dad's side older brother) mismanaged our family property and sold off a generational home for \"profit\" and no one forgave him for that. This was two decades ago and the family still is bitter about it. The idea was to entrust him the property as he was older. Similar to this story.\n\nSecond story: My wife gave all her grandparents inheritance (which was split evenly) to her brother because he spent every summer with them and took care of them later when they were ill while she got to go to med school and become well off and he's struggling a bit. She put all of it in his trust without hesitation. She told me that his happiness means more than anything to her and I loved and respected her even more after that. When it comes to family letting money drive a wedge is just not worth it. They'll remember how you treated them for years.", "Because what he was offering wasn\u2019t even OP\u2019s half if he sold to a stranger\u2026. If he sold it to a stranger for 750k and split it 50/50 he\u2019s better off then if brother offers him 200k all up.. at least that\u2019s how I took it", "Ben offered a substantially lower amount below true value. It isn\u2019t specified how much lower. It could have been 1/4 of the true value. We don\u2019t have the actual numbers to justify, but OPs 3rd to last paragraph says it wouldn\u2019t have benefitted his family or Ben. So if Ben had offered half, it wouldn\u2019t have affected OPs family. And the bank won\u2019t do a mortgage for a home that is not up to code and habitual.", "it\u2019s a white elephant", "It\u2019s great that Ben had a dream of living in the house, but it was a fantasy, not a goal he\u2019d been working toward.", "This was my question. All these relatives that are upset and siding with Ben. Did THEY offer to pony up some money to buy OP out? Or to give Ben the money to up his offer to OP? Doesn't sound like it.", "market value includes the fact that it needs repair. if a property that normally would be 10 dollars requires 1 dollar in repairs, it\u2019s market value would be approximately 9 dollars", "The same way that homeowners who aren't living from paycheck to paycheck do, they take a home equity line of credit. No one with any financial common sense pays for extensive repairs out of pocket.", "OP explicitly says the brother would pay for it out of savings.", "And yet OP says his brother has a savings account. Kinda hard to have a savings account if they can\u2019t actually afford anything enough to be borrowing money from family. So, I wonder how much job hopping the brother is doing and what kind of jobs these are. Is he switching jobs every year or two? Not that unusual. Is he switching jobs every couple of months? Not normal, unless it\u2019s something like construction/plumbing/electrical/etc.", "Yeah, any lawyer would say hell no to that arrangement. Brother could stop paying OP, and then OP would have to waste money taking him to court.", "Didnt need renovations for a grandma, im sure the brother could make do. Assuming the house is paid off, a HELOC could be taken out relatively cheaply to fix up any necessary repairs. These are the types of properties that a family will never get back and years from now the brother that sold will be regretting this. Victorian house with ocean front views in exchange for some a quick buck.", "It is all depends on how mich brother offered to pay. I think we need more info", "I don't know, I mean.. he said he was financially stable BEFORE the house was left to him. The house was free to him, and he said his brother had enough to offer to buy the house (albeit for less than what OP wanted) using \"almost all\" of his savings. Stands to reason that, if he gave his brother the house for free (which is how OP got it, for free) his brother would have enough in savings to at least start renovations and OP would be no worse off financially than he already was. Even just letting him stay there and work on it without singing anything over could have been done. This house has been in the family for generations, it wasn't just the brother this affected. Not making a million dollars off the house doesn't \"ruin his families financial stability\" as you say, it just keep them right where they are, which is where he'd be if Grandma had left the house to the brother instead.", "If OP was going to give their brother half the money anyway, I suppose they could have sold the house to the brother for half of market value.  OP would net the same amount of money.  The brother could sell and get \"his half\" if it proved to be too much to get the house up to code.", "Being honest. \n\nOP is the house owner so can do what he wants with the property. If someone is to blame about the selling is grandma. \n\nWhat OP doesnt get to do is to tell his brother and family he did it for them. The brother couldnt afford the market price, that's ok. But to assume he would end in bankrupcy and asking people for money to do the repairs are OP speculations.", "Everyone seems to forget Ben had money saved up to offer on the house  just not as much as OP would get at fair market. Which let's be honest , isn't fair at the moment at all. The market that is. Is a generational family home. Not just some home. He wasn't currently borrowing money. He had in the past. This was a power move. You're right the grandma did them dirty. * note to self be like uncle, blow it all so nobody can bitch.", "I have no idea where OP lives but property is expensive, and interest rates keep going up.

He doesn't need another house, or wants to maintain it. \n\nLittle brother needs a leg up and his dream house comes up but he's not chosen (for all we know that will could have been written well before the younger grandson was born and never updated). The bigger person would offer it up. It's hand up, not a handout. The onus is now on Lil bro to step up and make something of himself and honouring the legacy of that family home. I feel sorry that the house and those memories will be demolished and an ugly modern shit box put in it's place. \n\nOP doesn't have any sentimental bone about it. He has taken it as a payday and essentially given everyone the finger. \n\nI've always felt icky about accepting an inheritance. It seems to always bring out the worst in people.

I pass the farm to visit my sisters. \n\nI'm like you, I cannot forgive or forget the betrayals of someone making financial decisions when it was openly known I wanted to be on the farm.

I\u2019m also making the assumption that by Ben \u201cwiping out his savings\u201d to purchase the house he\u2019s talking about a down payment on a mortgage. As someone who spent her 20s being incredibly financially irresponsible and now has debts, no one with debts who borrows money is sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash in savings. However, if Ben is a first time home buyer he could probably get a predatory mortgage with a 3.5% down payment + closing costs. I know because I\u2019ve been house hunting for two years and since my credit score is high, despite my previous nonsense, mortgage companies are falling over themselves to give me high interest rate predatory mortgages. If you do a first time home buyer loan then you need to take our mortgage insurance which is an extra few hundred dollars on top of your monthly payments. None of this takes property taxes into account. After all of this, Ben would need to take out an additional loan or secondary mortgage (there\u2019s an actual word for it I just can\u2019t remember what it is) to cover the cost of renovations. Renovating old homes is incredibly expensive and if the general area is a higher cost of living then the cost of repairs will be higher by default.

However, the house was still on oil heat with an aging oil tank in the basement, the roof was 50 years old and leaking, the chimney was on the verge of collapse (and probably a big part of why the roof was leaking), there was no insulation and there were holes in the aging siding. We expected all of that before buying, but updating the climate control, completely demoing the chimney and replacing the roof and siding is tens of thousands of dollars. Fortunately, because we live in Massachusetts and were installing more efficient climate control, our state paid for a large portion of new insulation and asbestos removal for the old heating system. After we did all that work and moved in, we discovered that the toilet had a crack in the back where we missed it during the walk through and had to do some emergency bathroom repair.
