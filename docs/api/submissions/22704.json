This  house is the stuff of picture postcards \u2014 a lovely Victorian-era home  with a view of the sea. It has been in our family for generations, and  it holds an immense amount of sentimental value for all of us,  particularly for my younger brother, Ben (31M).\n\nSince  we were children, Ben has always been enchanted by that house. He'd  spend hours exploring every nook and cranny, daydreaming about the life  he'd lead there. As we grew older, his dream never wavered \u2014 he wanted  to live in that house.\n\nWhen our  grandmother's will was read, it turned out she had left the house to me.  I was living in the city, happily settled with my own family and  career. Ben, on the other hand, was still living paycheck to paycheck,  constantly in between jobs, and often borrowing money from our parents  or me.\n\nSeeing the state of the  house after our grandmother's passing, it was clear it needed serious  renovation. There were issues with the plumbing, the roof needed  repairs, and the old wiring was a safety hazard. All these renovations  were necessary to make the house habitable, and they would cost a  significant amount of money. Money that Ben didn't have and I wasn't in a  position to provide without jeopardizing my own family's financial  stability.\n\nTaking all this into  account, I deciding selling the house was the best option. The housing  market was favorable, and we stood to make a considerable profit from  the sale. My plan was to split the money equally. I wasn't in dire need  of all the money as we lived somewhat comfortable and this way, Ben  would have a substantial amount to clear his debts and could rent or  even buy a smaller place where he could start afresh.\n\nBen  proposed I sold the house to him at a considerably lower price than the  market value. I declined this offer as the amount he was offering was significantly less and almost all of his savings leaving very little  left in terms of living costs and expenses. I told him that it wasn't a  good idea for him, nor was it beneficial to me and my family, whereas  selling it for a much higher value on the open market and splitting the  money with him, meant we both walk away much more financially stable.\n\nBen  was heartbroken and accused me of betraying him and selling off his  dream. I tried to explain my perspective, that it was for his own good,  but he saw it as me being pragmatic at the cost of his feelings. He  stopped talking to me, and the rest of our family took his side saying I was selfish. \n\nThis whole  situation has left me riddled with guilt. I never wanted to upset Ben,  but I genuinely believed \u2014 and still believe \u2014 that selling the house  was in our best interest, especially his.", "created_utc": 1689831622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154i4ob/aita_for_selling_my_late_grandmothers_house/", "score": 1146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he told you the house was more important then the money he would get and you disregarded that because, obviously you know better, that makes you TA. Which makes what you did ultimately come down to betraying your brother for the money you got for selling the house.

He\u2019d have to get a mortgage on it", "Also if OP is more financially responsible\u2026 it really, really makes sense to leave it to her.", "Well someone woke up and choose violence.", "But that would be his problem, it\u2019s not OP\u2019s place to decide what is and what is not a good financial decision for his brother.", "Treating him like an adult means offering him the opportunity to buy it, and if he can't or won't pay asking price, then that's fine and someone else will get it. It also means doing that without being paternalistic and telling him you know better than him.", "> if he had done that, you'd be calling him a heartless a bag for refusing to meet him halfway.\n\nIt's always nice to meet complete strangers who know me so well they can not only know what I'm thinking but confidently get it completely wrong.", "\"help with the repairs\"?? Ben was offering to buy the house, OP would be continuing to live comfortably in their comfortable life in the city having nothing to do with it.\n\nMinimum wage jobs don't save up enough money to make even a below market offer on a house like that.

OP would have said so if it was THAT much less.", "A lot of older generations leave things to whoever is the oldest. Birth order doesn\u2019t make you more deserving. Since we don\u2019t know why she chose the older brother, it\u2019s unfair to say the older brother deserved it. It could have been completely arbitrary and with the intention of being shared.", "Yeah the op is telling porkies. If you're living pay check to pay check you can't buy a house for say 250k instead of 500k, because living pay check to pay check means you have no savings or you wouldn't be living pay check to pay check. \n\nEither op, much better off, is misleading when saying the brother is living pay check to pay check and means brother doesn't make as much as him and can't afford the house at the price he wants, or he's pushing a narrative to make himself sound better for selling the house.\n\nIf op doesn't need the money and can only not afford to renovate it himself, then why not let the brother live there, pay a formal but not normal rent that goes towards ownership of the house. Like say 2k a month over time where he's buying a percentage of the house rather than it being a waste. OP is being paid just over time. Let the brother live there and do it up, if his situation improves and he can get a mortgage to buy out the op in one go, address that when the time comes. If brother runs out of cash and can't afford it then sell once the brother realises he can't afford it. If OP doesn't need the cash why is he rushing to sell rather than try to keep it in the family.", "He\u2019s not financing his dream. If his brother is able to pay for half then he\u2019s coming out with the same amount either way. If the brother fails to keep the house, the brother fails to keep the house but that\u2019s on him. It\u2019s not his place to decide what his brother can and cannot afford.", "And what do you think the brother would have used to pay op if he needs to borrow money to live from time to time?!", "Yea, a HELOC would be granted to someone like the brother who's jumping from job to job and needs to liquidate all of his savings to buy a house a \"considerably lower price\" than market", "He is constantly in between jobs.  He probably has bad credit.  No bank wants that.\n\nAnd the bank is not allowed to just keep the difference, as you\u2019re suggesting.

Renovating an old house costs a huge amount of money.  There are several other factors that go into redoing an older home, that can skyrocket the price.     \n\nBanks and finance companies want the money.

It's a lot of work to resell and the condition they get it in is a gamble, even selling it at a profit or break even is a gamble.", "If it's as bad as OP makes it out to be, renovating the house could cost as much as a new house.

I guess your issue is just with him saying this out loud, which I get, it comes across patronising.", "Op put it on the market didn't search for a specific buyer to sell privately so what exactly stopped the brother to go to the realtor and make an offer?! ( Aside from not being able to afford the price of course).\n\nPut on the market = public Sale , so equally available for the brother.

You're simple enough you think the fuckup brother had a right to get the house for a steal because it was \"his dream.\"", "Yeah except that the brother already borrowed money from several people in the past, what are the chances he will be able to manage with a mortgage and renovations to finance?", "We don't know, given he described the brother as not financially stable and offering significantly less I was thinking he offered something like 30% of the value", "The brother will have to get a mortgage and such. He\u2019d get the house but would have to invest a lot into renovations, and the mortgage whilst having used up all his savings and not in consistent work", "If she wanted it shared, she could have put split in the will. Her lawyer would have advised that too.", "It's not a fact that the brother has savings and it doesn't sound very likely if he lives paycheck to paycheck and often needs to borrow money. He might have planned to get a mortgage to buy out OP. \n\n\"Considerably less\" is indeed vague. But I took it to mean even less than 50% of market value.", "I understand what you're trying to explain, but I think OP makes clear that wasn't the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>he was offering was **significantly less** (...). I told him that it wasn't a  good idea for him, **nor was it beneficial to me** and my family, (...) meant we **both walk away much** more financially stable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds like the brother was offering him something similar to $30 (this is speculation), while spending all his money/savings (so having no money to spend maintaining a very expensive house). Whereas selling the house would mean both earing $50.", "The problem with this logic is it isn\u2019t the whole picture. The house needed a tremendous amount of work to make it livable and we don\u2019t know if the brother was using his little savings to buy the house outright or if he was getting a mortgage and the saving was a down payment. \n\nKnowing the location and the market my guess is that the brother would have been taking out a mortgage and wiping his savings was only for a down payment. So he would be out of his savings, living paycheck to paycheck, with a mortgage, and a very large amount of expensive work that had to be done on the house. \n\nEven if he was buying the house outright he\u2019d still have no way to make all of the necessary fixes for the house so now he owns a home that will be less and less livable as time goes by as well as upkeep and tax expenses he can\u2019t afford. \n\nAlso, if he was buying it outright and he\u2019s as bad with money as OP states I\u2019d assume your math is off. It\u2019s more like selling it on the open market and splitting it $50 a piece vs selling it to his brother for $10, not $50.  \n\nUltimately we don\u2019t have enough info to know the likely hood of default and financial ruin selling it to his brother could have caused.", "Finally someone said it!", "Unless OP essentially gave him the house for free. The brother would have to get a mortgage. Getting loans for renovations as well would not be a good idea", "[removed]", "In Ireland repossessing a property is hell for the banks.\n\nIt takes years and thousands in fees and the home owner can show up a court case and offer to make a nominal payment less than the interest rate (and if he convinces the court its all he can do) he will be able to keep the house.", "I admire how you're able to hear that you're wrong and still bluster on regardless without changing anything. It's quite a trick.", "So? Who hasn't borrowed money.

Lets say house was 100k. Brother offered 50k. OP nopes out.\n\n\nInstead OP sells house for 100k. Keeps 50k and gives 50k to brother.\n\n\nSo while I dont disagree with the financial intelligence that OP based his answer on, all his logic didnt see him calculating ruining his familial relationships.", "From the tone of the post, OP just decided to make the decision for Ben that it was in his best interest to have half the proceeds instead of a house to fix up.\n\nNow Ben is stuck renting shitty places when he could have paid the same to fix up his dream home and build an asset.", "OP is clearly financially literate and would have said something like \u201coffered less than half the value\u201d - there\u2019s no way it was 30%", "Yes, the brother.

Watched a family member sell a generational property when we all knew our grandparents thought family was decent enough to share.  \n\nPeople - be direct in your wills.  State outright that things are shared.   Don't leave a path of heartbreak while family members watch sentimental item after sentimental item be sold because you picked the \"financially sound\" one to inherit everything thinking they'd share and wouldn't feel the need to sell since they already had money.

That\u2019s why I think OP should\u2019ve listed the actual numbers (or equivalent examples) and also given the rest of his family a chance to make up the difference before selling to a stranger.", "If you get something for free and then sell it for 10$ it is still beneficial to you because you didn\u2019t sink any money initially.", "The brother had the funds to do a \"significantly lower offer\" with a mortgage.  \n\nOP wanted to split the proceeds evenly.  \n\nWith those being true, OP would have received the same amount of cash in hand if he sold to the brother at half price.

Fully summarised it comes down to 2 issues:   \n1: The money the brother offered was significantly less than what OP would've gotten if he had sold the house on the market. \n\n2: The brother would have no money left and would not be able to maintain the expensive house. By selling the house the brother actually got a lot of money, instead of being close to bankrupt."]}
