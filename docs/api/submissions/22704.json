This  house is the stuff of picture postcards \u2014 a lovely Victorian-era home  with a view of the sea. It has been in our family for generations, and  it holds an immense amount of sentimental value for all of us,  particularly for my younger brother, Ben (31M).\n\nSince  we were children, Ben has always been enchanted by that house. He'd  spend hours exploring every nook and cranny, daydreaming about the life  he'd lead there. As we grew older, his dream never wavered \u2014 he wanted  to live in that house.\n\nWhen our  grandmother's will was read, it turned out she had left the house to me.  I was living in the city, happily settled with my own family and  career. Ben, on the other hand, was still living paycheck to paycheck,  constantly in between jobs, and often borrowing money from our parents  or me.\n\nSeeing the state of the  house after our grandmother's passing, it was clear it needed serious  renovation. There were issues with the plumbing, the roof needed  repairs, and the old wiring was a safety hazard. All these renovations  were necessary to make the house habitable, and they would cost a  significant amount of money. Money that Ben didn't have and I wasn't in a  position to provide without jeopardizing my own family's financial  stability.\n\nTaking all this into  account, I deciding selling the house was the best option. The housing  market was favorable, and we stood to make a considerable profit from  the sale. My plan was to split the money equally. I wasn't in dire need  of all the money as we lived somewhat comfortable and this way, Ben  would have a substantial amount to clear his debts and could rent or  even buy a smaller place where he could start afresh.\n\nBen  proposed I sold the house to him at a considerably lower price than the  market value. I declined this offer as the amount he was offering was significantly less and almost all of his savings leaving very little  left in terms of living costs and expenses. I told him that it wasn't a  good idea for him, nor was it beneficial to me and my family, whereas  selling it for a much higher value on the open market and splitting the  money with him, meant we both walk away much more financially stable.\n\nBen  was heartbroken and accused me of betraying him and selling off his  dream. I tried to explain my perspective, that it was for his own good,  but he saw it as me being pragmatic at the cost of his feelings. He  stopped talking to me, and the rest of our family took his side saying I was selfish. \n\nThis whole  situation has left me riddled with guilt. I never wanted to upset Ben,  but I genuinely believed \u2014 and still believe \u2014 that selling the house  was in our best interest, especially his.", "created_utc": 1689831622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154i4ob/aita_for_selling_my_late_grandmothers_house/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She picked one grandchild and left it to them rather than the grandchild who had a greater sentimental attachment to the house.\n\nI suspect she did that because she figured op was well off enough to pay for maintaining the house but as it wasn't talked about before hand it's impossible to say.\n\nOP shared the money from the sale with his siblings when he could have pocketed himself as the owner of the house imo he is definitely nta here.", "INFO: Did your grandmother leave anything to Ben?\n\n(Also, does anyone know if this is the plot line to a book or movie?)", "Info: Did you get the house just because you're the oldest? Did your brother get something of equal value?", "NAH. You made the pragmatic and generous decision, and materially, Ben is better off for it, but emotionally, you broke his heart, so his anger and distress at you is understandable, and to some extent warranted from the POV that he will have no way of ever achieving that particular dream. But I can\u2019t judge you the AH for this, as you have the clarity/ financial literacy to understand that his dream was in fact a money put that would cause him to go under faster and deeper than he already is.\n\nAs you articulated- were you have done anything else, and he wasn\u2019t only viewing this through and emotional lense, you would have done him a disservice- even giving him the home with no funds to make it structurally sound would have meant that he\u2019d need to go into further debt (if he would even been approved for the loans required, which sounds doubtful) and then if he hadn\u2019t been able to make those payments he\u2019d have lost the house anyway.\n\nSo, yeah, giving him half the proceeds was the most beneficial option for him, but that\u2019s not going to sink in for Ben for quite some time.", "Could you not have sold it to your brother for the same price and give him instalments to pay off? Selling it to help with his financial stability is not the altruistic thing you think it is. If he wanted to be in debt while keeping and owning the house, that's his choice. I get that you get to ultimately decide what you want to do with the house, but your justification is what pushed the judgement to YTA.", "Info- was the amount he was offering you more or less what your half of the profit from the sale was?", "NTA\n\nProbably will be blasted on this sub, but it\u2019s *your* house. Sure it was in your family for generations but keeping it when you don\u2019t have the money to take care of it seems worse. The house would have just been left in disarray, deteriorated and cause problems later on.\n\nSure, your family had an emotional connect but then maybe they could have contributed towards upkeep or buying it at market price. It\u2019s easy to criticise someone, difficult to be the one to take decisions.\n\nAlso, I won\u2019t recommend giving anyone a share of the sale. It will either seem like \u2018buying their appeasement\u2019 or rewarding them for bad behaviour. Regardless, your money, your decision.", "How much of a discount was he asking for?

You'd have 50 coins and no house. But he'd be happier.", "YTA. Don't try to justify it by saying \"it's for your own good\". Your brother's a grown a$$ man and he can make his own decisions.

But you put finances over your brother's childhood dream. Adult reasoning doesn't really fix that wound. Technically NTA for selling your own property, but it sounds like this wasn't a financial windfall that you'd been counting on and maybe it wasn't exactly necessary to break your brother's heart.\n\nI've been in a similar situation where it WAS necessary to sell the family property, and even though I don't think the seller was an AH, it's been about half a decade and it still hurts just as much to know I'll never get that house back.\n\nSo NTA, but I don't blame your brother if he doesn't want to spend his time talking to you after this when it's in his best interest to use that time on other things.", "Technically, it's your house that you inherited, so you can do what you like with it so NTA. I do think you have made an extremely selfish decision, and I'd be passed off if I was your family.\nIt's a family home that has been passed down for generations, plus your brother has shown more than a significant interest in it.\nI understand why you did it, though it could have been a holiday home for all the family. Your brother could have rented it from you, and the money could go towards renovations. If you had discussed it with your entire family, maybe someone else would have purchased it from you, or you could have sold part ownership to your brother, and he could renovate it while living there. There were so many other options, though the one you landed on best suited you.", "Hard to collects instalments from someone that jumps from job to job and borrows money to get by.", "If the brother is asking money from family to live, how would he afford a mortgage for an expensive house that will require expensive renovations? \nThe brother can't afford the market value that's why he proposed a very low price, and he probably won't be able to afford that either but that's all he can afford.  \nSo he will then come back to OP for money just to be able to live, leaving OP with less money from the sale and having to bail him out again in the future. \nIt's a lose-lose situation for OP sell to market value and be the asshole to the brother, sell to the brother and impact his family financial stability. \nI understand his position of giving priority to his family, yeah the brother had a dream and he will blame OP for not realising it, but it's not OP's fault if he isn't financially stable.", "I agree. NTA. It's not your responsibility to fund your brother's dream. The family that thinks Ben deserves the house can certainly pitch in and help him buy it at market. Nobody's stopping them from actually putting their words into action.\n\nThe only AH territory is where you say that you're selling for his own good. You are not Ben's custodian. It's cool to look out for yourbrother, but that comment won't be good for your relationship.", "It didn't have to be bought at market price.  Since OP said he would split the money with brother, brother only had to pay OP half the market price.  OP says, \"considerably less\" and I find it suspicious that they don't say half market price or below half the market price.\n\nWhen my parents passed there were 4 of us siblings.

Ruin his families financial stability?\n\nLife isn't a fairytale, realistically this house had to go.

She didn't need it to justify her decision, and all it did was hurt her brother. It was fine to explain to Ben that his proposal wasn't viable, that he would have been left house-poor (especially rough when the house in question is old needs a lot of work), but that's as far as OP should have gone. Telling him her decision was for his own good was treating him like a child.", "No need to reply to me. I\u2019m not invested in this.
