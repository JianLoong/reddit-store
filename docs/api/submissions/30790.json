Your feelings are valid too.   \n\n\nFor family peace you could say to Meera \u201cI am sorry that I was so harsh, in the moment I didn\u2019t edit my words carefully, but you do need to understand that your trauma has just collided with my own, and I cannot spend time with you until I process this.

You for how you handled it. You are projecting your feelings about your parents\u2026 onto Meera. Meera does not deserve that blame.\n\nIt would have been more graceful of you to concentrate on the behaviour rather than the person. Meera is young. Allow her the space to make some poor choices and learn from it.", "ESH - yeah your sister did a shitty thing, but to her BOYFRIEND, not to you or your mom.  Your dad blew up a family and a marriage he made vows to, this is not nearly the same thing. And while sure, you could be disappointed in here your personalization of her relationship issues and making it all about you is way over the top. \n\nHonestly I feel bad for Meera. Her own mother\u2019s love is so shallow that she is willing to cut her off for this.", "I think your sister needs therapy. People who experienced something traumatic sometimes reenact their trauma. Maybe her trauma told her that either her or her boyfriend were going to cheat either way, so she should do it first to be hurt less. Maybe she felt happy but her trauma told her that she was too happy so she had to sabotage herself.\n\nI understand that you were disappointed in her, but if it really only was her cheating on her boyfriend, then shouldn't you try to understand her?\n\nESH in my opinion", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
