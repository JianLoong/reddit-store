It's even worse, because you know how much it hurts.\n\nEasiest NTA imaginable", "Idk I guess it depends in how you were raised.

We don\u2019t really block/excommunicate but we distance.\n\nOP\u2019s family was thrown into chaos by the very similar actions of their father.

I'd tell them all to go pound sand! Your mom must be soooo very disappointed to learn of her daughter's complete lack of character, morals and values.   \n\n\nEspecially with your sister having had a front row seat and witnessing your mom's pain and trauma after the exact same betrayal was inflicted upon her. And no doubt, you must feel the same way and are reacting accordingly. Your sister's horrendous actions have consequences. She has no one to blame but her own selfish self.", "NTA. She needs to hear the harsh truth it's the only way she'll learn from it. Actions have consequences. She made a stupid decision and now she has to pay for it. She doesn't deserve an apology and she only deserves forgiveness if she makes amends and puts effort into changing.\n\nHer trauma does not give her an excuse to traumatize others.", "NTA\n\nI'm not surprised your father ended up that way if the grandparents are enabling her behavior. Probably also said a lot of things about how it is your mom's fault your dad cheated when they got divorced.\n\nWas it harsh to say that to your sister? Probably, a bit but actions have consequences. She can't do the same thing your father did and expect people who had trauma because of it to understand her side. Plus, there's really no excuse to screw over your boyfriend and best friend. She made her bed, she should sleep in it.", "NTA. Meera is  an adult and responsible for her behavior. She has to live with the consequences of her chosen behavior. If she has trauma she should go get MH care. Your grandparents enabled your father's bad behavior and Meera's. I would block them too.", "NTA these are the natural consequences of her actions.\n\nHopefully she comes to her senses.", "NTA why would you GAF what these people expect from you? They raised a cheater, your grandparents are probably cheaters too. Tell them to fuck off!", "I mean, of course your grandparents blamed the people who got cheated on - they're the ones who raised your cheating father after all \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI'm surprised they haven't joined their golden boy in the NC dumpster...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, honey", "Apologize to her for what? She had front row seats to the hell cheating puts people through and she just did the exact same thing to 2 people. She\u2019s literally putting Vivian in the same position your mom was in considering she\u2019s supposed to be her best friend. She\u2019s only upset because everyone found out. Did she even apologize to her ex bf and ex bff?", "NTA. Your sister sounds like trash. \n\nI'll note that the ex-boyfriend sending you pictures of her cheating is creepy, and might indicate that there were reasons to get out of that relationship...but that doesn't excuse cheating with her friend's boyfriend.", "Waaaah I'm so traumatized from my dad's affair that I'm going to recreate it then cry when someone calls me out on it. \n\nNTA. She made her choice, she is literally doing what your dad did, so yes, she is like him. She needs to take accountability and grow tf up.  Did someone hold a gun to her head? No? Then why is she acting like the victim here\n\nIk your grand parents are defending her because she's their grandchild and they love her but, really? There is literally no valid excuse on earth for what she did.", "You're NTA.\nYour sister did almost the same thing as your father. I say 'almost' because the only difference is that no one was married in your sister's case.\nI suspect your sister is upset that she got caught and her boyfriend ratted her out.", "NTA Your sister is a selfish cheating lying asshole. You can't sugar coat that. Tell your grandparents to learn some morals, though it's probably a bit late since they never taught their son any.", "ESH-  I know everyone in these subs love to hate a cheater, so I\u2019m going to be reviled for this.  However, what Des did was revenge porn.  Sending pictures of his girlfriend to her family?!  Your sister was violated.  I know you can\u2019t see past the hated cheating part, but Des is a criminal AH.  Maybe a little compassion for your sister wouldn\u2019t go amiss.  As for the cheating part\u2026 maybe your sister is like your dad and maybe she\u2019s not.  Because your dad\u2019s crimes go well beyond cheating.  In fact, by the sound of it, that was only a symptom of his poor character, he was far more than just a cheater.  Anyway, you don\u2019t know what went on between your sister and Des, nor is it any of your business.  But she\u2019s lost her boyfriend and her best friend, so I imagine she\u2019s feeling the sting of her betrayals from the people who she betrayed, as it should be.  She\u2019s an AH.  People make mistakes.  Big mistakes.  You make mistakes, you do/will make big, hurtful mistakes.  Because that is life and no one is perfect.  If your sister is a good person, then understand she\u2019s not perfect.  She doesn\u2019t need your forgiveness because her situation with her boyfriend isn\u2019t your business to know, regardless of what Des has orchestrated.  Your grandparents point is that you took a situation you know nothing about and used it as a weapon to hurt your sister where you knew it would do the most damage.  That DOES require an apology, because you were an AH.  The situation is triggering you, obviously, and with good reason.  But don\u2019t mistake your sister for your father.  You\u2019re young and young people are prone to absolutes, but judging someone by their worst mistake makes all folks a  judgey AH at any age.", "YTA. Why would you take her cheating so personally? She did not cheat on you. Why would you side with her boyfriend??", "NTA. Also block your grandparents.", "NTA", "Block them too. \n\nNTA", "NTA as you Said Like father Like daughter. She is exactly like him.", ">about how ashamed they were that I could tell my sister something so cruel\n\nMaybe you should have told them that you're disappointed they raised a cheater.  NTA\n\nAnd don't apologize, they can go f themselves.", "It hurts my heart that your grandparents choose to victim blame.", "NTA, you also went through the same trauma and didn't make that decision. She made her choice", "Your grandparents defending your sister's bad behavior...is probably what they did with your dad. I'm proud of you for having standards and going NC w/ your sister. She's shown she has bad personal values. Next time it could be your SO (since she has NO sense of loyalty to commitments).", "NTA. She is getting the treatment she deserves. It's obvious why your grandparents are on her side. They raised a low life cheat.", "The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.

Block them all", "[removed]", "No DNA test needed", "The way their grandparents are talking they probably think that\u2019s how it works and she has no responsibility for her actions. Hell, they probably cheated too", ">what a lot of crap they spewing \n\nThat it's the partners of the cheaters who are the problem.  I'm sensing this disorder starts at the top and rolls on down.", "Unfortunately this sense of respect/loyalty/boundaries are easy to accomplish, but SO few people have.", "Maybe because they condoned it when their son was the cheater, so now, why not condone  it with their granddaughter?", "Screw family peace. If she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with a cheater, she doesn\u2019t have to have one.", "they raised the OG cheater, I guess they're fine with it in general", "She spoke harsh truth. There\u2019s nothing wrong with pointing out to her sister she became the thing she loathed - their father.", "No, families NEED to hold their members responsible for their actions...maybe THEN we'd have less bad events in the world", "Plus, she doesn't need to apologize to a cheater about her CHEATING!!!!", "Let me break it down for you:\n\nOpie and her sister both saw first hand how cheating destroys a relationship because of how it tore their family apart. Their mother was basically cheated on by their father with the best friend. \n\nIt caused hell on to the two girls, so much so that it made them decide to cut contact with their cheat of a father.\n\nNow, years later and Opie's sister is doing the same thing that caused the whole strain on their lives and crushed their mother's heart. \n\nUnderstand this, the sister may not have cheated on Opie but she did do something horrible that traumatized their childhood, so in turn, NTA", "Possibly some kind of trauma thing? Just guessing here.", "I wasn\u2019t even raised that way but it\u2019s how I feel. It\u2019s a morality thing and it would 100% color how I see someone. Of course my dad WAS a cheater so I do have pretty strong feelings about it generally so \ud83d\ude02"]}
