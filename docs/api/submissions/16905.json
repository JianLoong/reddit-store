When my daughter (now 21F) was 18, I found out she had an OnlyFans account, by accidentaly walking in on her taking photos of herself. I was very angry and shocked, but, once I got a bit more cool-headed, I realised that I probably wouldn't be able to stop her even if I tried. I sat her down and tried to explain what my concerns were, and how she should give this decision a lot of thought, but I emphasised that I would still love and support her even if she decided to continue, since she was old enough to make decisions for herself. I felt a lot of sympathy for her, because as a single mother I wasn't able to provide for her the nice life she deserved growing up. We were living in a one-bedroom appartment for many years, frequently skipping meals to make ends meet. The few hundred extra dollars in her pocket every month from OnlyFans made a real difference to her happiness: she was able to go out with her friends to concerts, buy nicer clothes and makeup, and didn't have to work her weekend job.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, and OnlyFans exploded in popularity, she went from making a few hundred dollars a month to a few thousand. Over those months, OnlyFans became a full-time career for her. When restrictions eased up, she started performing hardcore content, and, with her new-found money, was able to afford a lavish (by my standards at least) style of living. She rented a nice place of her own, partied a lot, and seemed to be enjoying her life.\n\nLast week, she showed up at my place, in tears. She was broke, and she admitted that she'd developed a drug problem. She screamed at me, telling me I'd ruined her life and that I should've stopped her from using OnlyFans when she was 18. She called me irresponsible, lazy (for not making more money so that she \"wouldn't have had to turn to OnlyFans\") and a horrible mother. She told me that every relationship she ever cared about ended when the guy found out what she did for a living, and that I shouldn't have \"stood by applauding while she ruined her own life.\" Her comments really hurt me, and I have been crying non-stop for the past week pretty much.\n\nI'm torturing myself with these thoughts, and I just want to know where I stand. I'm worried I let my daughter down, and that she's right and I'm a terrible mother. But I also feel intensely angry at her, like I'll go crazy unless scream \"I told you so\" and \"you didn't listen\" at her. Was I an asshole mother, or should I be justifiably angry about how she's handled her life?", "created_utc": 1683743288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dz23y/aita_because_i_didnt_do_enough_to_discourage_my/", "score": 3598, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nor did you stand by \"applauding,\" being supportive of your child's choices is difficult sometimes, but you had zero control at that point.  Stand strong mom, you did NOTHING wrong.  Stop beating yourself up about the past too, you did your best with what you had, a one-bedroom is better than a box on the street. Skipping meals is better than days without food.  She needs to be responsible now and fix her own life by making smarter choices.  NTA Good luck!", ">since she was old enough to make decisions for herself.\n\nShe was 18. You gave her the freedom to make adult decisions as an adult. Her poor decisions from that point on are on her shoulders, not yours.\n\nYou didn't get her addicted to drugs.

The consequences are on her.", "NTA you didn\u2019t encourage her to start doing porn, just found out about it and didn\u2019t judge her too harshly. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYou treated her as an adult and shared your concerns.

There's lots of mature, stable guys who aren't so judgemental. \n\nSex work is work. And honestly it sounds like what really \"ruined her life\" was hardcore drugs, not her onlyfans. You can argue that OF allowed her to afford drugs, but... Most people with some extra cash don't just develop drug addiction. \n\nThere's many factors, like genetic predisposition and who your friends are. She probably got exposed at parties with her trusted friends. \n\nWhat she needs now is rehab and recovery. It's not your fault she's in this bad place, it's not your fault that you're poor.

Which is sad because they are still developing, and don't have any experience in the real world yet.\n\nBut from your daughters pov you maybe should have pushed harder. And explained the real repercussions that will go along with pornography. Mainly being that most people will not want to date or marry someone that has produced and sold pornography. And a lot of companies will not hire someone, or will terminate someone else if they find out that they had an only fans. And it can severely impact their future in a massively negative way, for a small amount of money for a short amount of time.\n\nIt really needs to be hammered into kids that anything posted to the internet lasts forever. And if it is controversial in anyway, most career opportunities can be closed off to you.  And what is acceptable in society today may not be acceptable in 10-15 years. And the odds of really hitting it big are extremely low. And even if they do, it normally does not last very long.", "NAH. \n\nHonestly, people think that OnlyFans and other forms of virtual sex work aren't traumatizing, but they can be. It sounds like things were fine for her at first but to keep up with the market she had to escalate beyond her comfort zone, and it affected her really badly. I think she's probably really screwed up by her experience and wishes she had never done it. She sees you as someone who could have stopped her but didn't, and she's upset about it. I think she feels she wasn't mature or informed enough to make the decision and feels there should have been something in place to protect her--in this case you. And she feels like you didn't. I don't think she's TA, I think she's just processing trauma.\n\nAlso I don't think you're TA for not stopping her. She was an adult, what could you do to stop her? If you actually restricted her access to the internet and such it would have caused a massive rift in your relationship. You laid out your concerns and she ignored them.", "Honestly, I don't even think her having an OF was any part of the problem here. The problem was a girl who grew up poor suddenly having access to a significant amount of money. If after high school she'd suddenly gotten a high paying job that wasn't OF, there's every chance things would have turned out the exact same way.\n\nI think the failing here, and it's not your failing, is that she never learned financial responsibility.\n\nAs for her not being able to hold down a relationship because of being an OF model... well it's really just a fact of our society that sex workers get treated like shit. It's awful and it needs to change but if that's your line of work, that's really just how it goes. Personally speaking, I'd tell her to look at it a different way. Does she really want to be in a relationship with someone who's so insecure that he'd treat her like that just for her profession. It may be harder on her but there are dudes who are supportive of their partner's sex work. Hell, she could get together with a male sex worker and making content could become a couples thing for them.\n\nIt's an unfortunate fact that some areas of life are just harder for sex workers but that doesn't mean the profession itself is bad, just how society treats people who do it.\n\nI'd see if you can find her a SW friendly therapist who can talk through these issues with her and if you know any financial planners you can trust it wouldn't hurt to set her up with one so she can better manage her money. If she's looking to get clean from her drug habit I'd do some research in NA groups in your area or rehab if that's something she can afford and/or needs.\n\nThe vast share of her unhappiness is coming from suddenly having more cash than she knew what to do with and using it irresponsibly. I got an inheritance of 12k when I was fourteen and it took me six months to spend 8k of it. Kids from poor families who suddenly come into money often go overboard.\n\nYou're not a bad parent for supporting her starting an OFs but now that you know all the problems she's been facing, you do have the opportunity to help her.", "NTA\n\nShe just needs someone to blame, and sadly, it's you. You voiced your concerns and worries. She said she was an adult and wanted to sell herself for some extra money. That's not your fault. Being a single mom in this economy is rough. You did what you could, and that's all that matters. This isn't your fault. \n\nMost women I know have an OFs, even ones who grew up with a silver spoon in their mouth. It's just the latest thing people do because it's a quick way to make an extra buck without doing a lot of work.", "NTA, you talked to her already and she still decided to take that route, she could\u2019ve carried on doing it without the drugs but decided to use them. It\u2019s not your fault at all, do not blame yourself, but support her now, she sounds angry and is taking it out on you, right now she needs her mother and that\u2019s what matters to get her back on her feet", "NTA\n\nShe was going to do it no matter what or how you said it to her. You voiced your concerns and treated her like the adult she was.\n\nShe doesn't get to blame you for her bad decisions.", "NTA. Your daughter is an adult. Adult take responsibility for their decisions. It\u2019s not your decision, hence you are not responsible.", "NTA. Ironically, she's screaming at you because you are a loving and supportive parent who creates a safe space for her to have feelings. If you were a bad parent, she wouldn't be crying to you about her choices. \n\nDo your best. Help her find a rehab, participate in family therapy, keep loving her, but try to grey rock her when she blames you for her choices.", "NTA. You did what you could. You believed she wouldn\u2019t have changed if you had tried more, based on your years of experience as her mother. She\u2019s ruined her own life and is looking for a scapegoat.", "NTA\n\nBut neither is your daughter. I definitely wouldn't be taking what she says to heart. She just admitted she has been suffering from a drug problem. Chances are, she's confused, scared, going through withdrawals, etc. She doesn't know what to do or say. Has she made some mistakes? Absolutely. But what she needs right now is her mother to be there for her and help her through the problems.\n\nDon't judge. Don't play the \"I told you so\" game. Don't be heartless and tell her she \"made her choices\" or try to control anything. This is the time to show compassion and support for her. Don't revel in being right or anything of that crap. Just be a loving mother.", "NTA, she was 18. If you said no, she may have just left home, moved in with someone, and did OF (and/or worse) there.\n\nIs she addicted to drugs? Does she sincerely want help to stop, if she is? You may be able to encourage her in that respect. My only advice her would be not to enable her habit. \n\nIs she was selling \"content\" then there are videos of her out in the either. Once something goes online it's out in the world permanently. Most guys don't want to see their girl doing hard core sex with other men so it's not surprising they all leave after they find out. \n\nI don't know how once doing OF will effect her job search. I think all hiring managers do a web search on possible employees before they hire. \n\nGood luck, those decisions are on her not you.", "NTA. Like you mentioned, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop her regardless plus she\u2019s an adult. You cautioned her, she ignored that to live her current lifestyle and now that she realizes she fucked up, she wants to point the finger rather than take accountability for her actions. Sounds like she needs to grow up", "NTA. \n\nShe was an adult and made adult choices. She has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA, its a situation where you are damned if you do or damned if you don't. If you had your foot down, I seriously doubt she would have stopped, and you two would not have had much of a relationship at that point. Since you treated her like an adult, she decided that it's easier to blame you for her choices than to take responsibility for herself. you laid out your concerns and thrn told her whatever she chose, you will still love her. It can't get any better than that between a parent and child.", "NTA. \n\nThis may sound harsh, but there are plenty of people who work in the sex industry that do not develop a drug problem or go broke. She decided to enter the sex industry through a very unstructured way: OnlyFans. \n\nTraditionally, someone would enter the sex field through interaction with studios and other seasoned performers. Now I\u2019m not going to sit here and say that way is perfect or safe. However, it does give people access to a community and people who have been in that industry for many years that can guide them and give them advice on how to operate appropriately and to build boundaries and safety nets. Once again, I am not seen that everybody is going to be a good and perfect person. But I am saying that there is knowledge with in that community. There are people who can monitor you, pull you aside and tell you if you need to change shit up real quick.\n\nThere have been plenty of sex workers on social media who continuously warn young people about entering the industry through OF. They continuously warn young people and tell them to think very carefully about whether or not this is an industry they want to be in. She had you warn her, there were plenty of people online who would\u2019ve been warning her. But she decided to play around and this is what happens when you enter a very unforgiving industry with no game plan.\n\nEssentially, she decided to become a freelance sex worker in a harsh industry. You warned her about this path. It is very unfortunate that she has a drug problem now. I do not believe addiction is caused by low morals, it is a chemical addiction. It is a medical condition. However, you are not responsible for her developing a drug habit.", "NTA. She made a decision to start an OF account and you told her your concerns and worries. She was an adult and ultimately was going to do what she wanted to do. Every parent on earth is going to tell their son/daughter their concerns about that.\n\nHer having an OF =\\\\= becoming a drug addict and blowing through her money. Those were her decisions to be irresponsible with her new lifestyle/money/decisions. I'm certain there are plenty of people with OF accounts who do not become drug addicts, go broke, or have bad dating experiences. Attempting to blame her bad decisions that led to her current situation on you is a lazy cop out.\n\nShe was enough of an adult to decide what to put of herself on the internet, she's enough of an adult to be responsible for her actions and choices afterwards. She cannot put on you that she, as an adult, decided to be on OF and that the men she met did not want to date someone who is creating internet porn.\n\nYou can, as her mom, try to help her now get back on her feet, work through the addiction issues and overcome them, get clean, and set herself back on track in life. That is what family does. But where she is now and the fallout from that is completely on her.", "NTA  \n\n\nAnd I know it won't make it hurt any less, but it's her drug-fuelled brain talking. \n\nYou're not a terrible mother. She is an adult. You did voice your concerns but at the end of the day she made that choice and the roads it led her down. And I'm not casting judgement on OF at all - people do what they want with their own bodies and good luck to them. But blaming you for her poor decisions and management of her own money, no, that's on her.\n\nIs she in rehab? I think the only way forward is for her to get clean and you can support her in that. But please do not take on HER responsibility for her own actions. She needs help and therapy for sure, but you could benefit from therapy too.\n\nWishing you both all the best.", "NTA, this is the fault of an economic system that incentivizes attractive young people to sell their bodies on the internet for short term financial gains.  There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with adult content or Onlyfans and I myself support the legitimacy of sexwork as a profession, but the level to which this is now immediately available to young people as soon as they turn 18 and is often far more lucrative than typical means of employment, makes it feel like as a society we are pimping out our young adults in an almost predatory manner.  It generally requires significantly less effort and vision than other forms of content creation, and has a low bar for entry, you can start by selling feet pics.  I\u2019m all for people sharing their self expression however they wish, but with economic and housing situations being what they are I do feel like there in immense pressure on young people today to seek an easy way to establish financial stability, I worry that more and more people are participating in sexwork not out of genuine desire to work in that field, but due to them seeing it as their best chance of a way out financially. This has always been a problem, but with modern technology and services is just feels more accessible to everyone than ever.\n\nWhat happened to your daughter was very unfortunate, but you should not under any circumstances blame yourself for how things have unfolded.  Her drug use seems to be the biggest issue here, but her having some regret about the lifestyle she chose is completely understandable she got in at a young age and ignored your warnings.  She\u2019s just out of line blaming it on you.", "NTA but i also want to add, I have family with drug addictions and they lash out. They dont mean it. Yes it hurts but try to remember that it is partially the drugs and the shame talking and she probably doesnt truly believe it. People lash out at the ones they love when they're struggling like that, some do it to shift the blame because they want no responsibility, some do it to push you away because it gives them an excuse to not get better and get worse instead because \"what else can i lose\" mindset. I'm really sorry youre going through this. I hope she will get help", "NTA\n\nPlenty of women made a lot of money on Onlyfans and didn't ruin their lives with subsequent bad choices or surround themselves with bad people.\n\nBlaming Onlyfans is just an excuse to downplay all the other piss poor decisions she actually made because it's an easy scapegoat.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s the drug problem talking. She\u2019s broke, someone needs blamed. This is how the story goes. All you can do now is support her getting sober.", "NTA. \n\n1. Her doing OF has nothing to do with her doing drugs and \"ruining her life.\"\n\n2. You couldn't have talked her out of it. She was already doing it anyway. \n\n3. Some people are going to mind that sort of job, some aren't. Just like some people only want to date virgins or someone that doesn't have tattoos or whatever.\n There are plenty of people doing OF that are in relationships, married, or even doing a joint account with their S/O. IMO that just points to that dude not being the one for her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Again, not on you.\n\n\n\nI have problems with people under a certain age doing OF but that's more to do with society's opinion on when adulthood starts vs when the brain typically matures fully and impulse control and all that settles more. However, again, she'd already started and you voiced your concerns. I don't think you could have stopped her either way. \n\nIt can be hard to take accountability for our actions at times and it sounds like that's where she is. Don't stress out listening to her blaming you. Just do what you can to help her through the drug problems and take accountability for herself and go from there.", "Hey who doesn\u2019t support their daughters career in porn? Ayth? No. But kinda morally bankrupt, yes.", "Yikes this took a turn. \n\nI think in our modern era onlyfans should be accepted as a normal career path.

If you want her to keep her own place, and you can pay some of the rent, maybe offer to help, but I don't think she'll get better that way. I didn't.

In your daughter's case, it was the most efficient way to make money without having to do back breaking or mind-numbing forms of labour. What were her other options? Continue to make minimum wage and struggle like she's seen you struggle her entire life? And then OF comes along and says 'you can make a lot of money, quite easily, if commodify yourself.' And at first turning herself into a commodity felt empowering - she's grown up in a society where porn is *everywhere*, it's infiltrated every aspect of our lives and people have spent the last 20 years insisting it's *'empowering'* - because all she had to do was take a few pictures and people would pay her.\n\nThe problem is that in order to make *more* money to support herself and drag herself out of poverty she had to start doing more and more extreme things to keep the cash flowing. And at first she probably didn't mind some of those extreme things because they didn't seem too bad. Maybe some of it was stuff she'd always wanted to try out and now she had an incentive. But that incentive doesn't make what she was doing *good* for her body or her mind. So, in order to drown out how unhappy she was with what she was doing, she turned to drugs. I'm not saying she did this consciously, but drugs are everywhere in porn because it makes the women easier to exploit. \n\nSo she turns to drugs.

What does onlyfans have to do with her drug use and partying habits?", "N T A. She has regrets, and instead of owning up to her choices, she blames you. No one forced her to do OF. No one, I assume, forced her to do drugs. The fact is that even if you wanted to stop her, she was a legal adult when she started. You would have had no say in how she lived her life.", "NTA. I don\u2019t have an only fans account but I\u2019m 29 and between 21 and 26 I got myself a drug problem (work in sales) and into thousands in debt.

I was an adult and made those poor decisions, just because she could see it happening it\u2019s not her fault to lock me away and stop me. \n\nTell your daughter how this makes you feel.

If she has a drug issue she maybe lashing out due to this, possibly dealing with a lot mentally. This, of course, doesn\u2019t justify saying what she said to you but could show she needs your support emotionally (as long as it\u2019s healthy for you) her out of a shitty situation and proper addiction support. There are amazing addiction charities out there which support both people in active addiction as well as the families with loved ones struggling with this. \n\nI hope she gets the support and help she needs, and that you both can get back to having a positive relationship.", "NTA, 18 is an adult and she was making decisions without you. Help her get into rehab and off of Only Fans. In a few years everything will disappear from the internet.", "NTA, you did fine for that situation. Sex work stigma is outside of your control and you clearly don't seem to be adding to that problem.\n\nWhat happened, I believe, was her addiction trying to get more drugs. The accusations she made don't have to be logical or reasonable, they are an effort to get drugs. You don't have to cut her out, but you need to set boundaries in the relationship that reflect your values, do not allow her to manipulate them. You can still love her, but she is going to need to help herself, as sucky as that is. Unfortunately, our society isn't so kind to addicts, but remember, they're people too and they do deserve support. Encourage therapy, she doesn't have to quit the drugs to start. Also be aware that within the sex work industry, there's a lot of abuse and trauma because the industry is largely not regulated, she may have been abused, which can lead to addiction.\n\nRemember, addiction is a symptom, not a personal failure.", "NTA.

NTA", "OP you're NTA. \n\nHowever l do think you overestimated your daughter's maturity in being able to handle the easy money OF provide in a responsible manner and the potential negative impact OF has on her.  \n\nFundamentally even if you tried to stop her at 18, she wouldn't have listened.  The money she was making was enough to dull whatever misgivings and gut feeling she has, and it enable her to go out, party, spent and living life.  \n\nNow she is faced head on with the negative aspects of doing OF, instead of understanding why, she wants to blame.  Blaming you is easier than admitting she fucked up, that she didn't think it through, that she didn't think about how it affects her mentally and the real life relationships. \n\nI had a friend who worked as a lapdancer when she was travelling.  She was in NZ when she began dancing in clubs to earn money for the next part of travelling.  She was in her 30's when she first started and danced for about 2 years.  She told me the smart ones (tend to be older  - late 20's onward) will save all the tips they get (which was alot), no drugs, little alcohol, and dance for a couple of years and leave.  She said the younger ones starting out often develop drink or drugs problem, and spent all their money quickly.\n\nDon't blame yourself.  Be there for your daughter.   She will have to learn by herself there is always pros and cons in any decisions she makes, and decide if the pros is worth it.", "Nta", "NTA it's one of the sad realities of prostitution and we're starting to see the ramifications of the boom onlyfans had during the pandemic, many of the people who turned to OF are unfortunately experiencing the same things as your daughter has. \n\nBut try to think about it, could you really have done anything to stop her when she was making the money she never had before?", "NTA - at 18, you can't control their lives in any meaningful way, and the harder you try, the more she would have fought you. The fact is, she thought it was a good idea at the time, even when you told her your concerns in a calm manner. The fact is, after providing advice/concern to someone, there's not a lot more you can do to dissuade someone, even your adult child, when they've got it in their heads to do something.   \n\n\nThe fact she found success on there for awhile also doesn't help the situation. If she didn't make any money, it would have blown over and she would have done something else. There are a lot of factors at play here, but you can't blame yourself. She's trying to avoid owning her decisions and her mistakes. It's an important life lesson. Let yourself feel the anger, because your feelings are important too, and then once you've processed it (as best you can) just try to be there for her.

There are a slew of O.F. performers that don't end up in the same situation as your daughter, but they clearly didn't make the same choices she did.\n\nThe fact is that, yes, she has gone on to ruin her life. Yes, her relationships more than likely tanked because of what she was doing for a living; it's very similar to the porn industry in that regard. But she's choosing to blame you because it's easier to do that than to acknowledge that this had very little to do with you. You essentially gave her an out, and she chose not to take it.

You never encouraged her to do Drugs???", "NTA.  \n\n\nListen, she's pushing blame outward because she doesn't want to take the blame for something that deeply hurt her. It's not even necessarily her own fault this happened either, she's just feeling very broken right now and regrettng the decision. You couldn't have known it would end up this way - nobody could.   \n\n\nShe was 18. I think if you HAD tried to stop her you would have been tarnished with all kind of names saying you were oppressing her and controlling etc etc.  This is kind of a no-win for you. You did the best thing you could and supported your daughter in what she thought she wanted to do, and some people out there would kill for a mom like that. And you said you did the right thing - you told her your concerns, but left the decision up to her. That's the best you could have ever done here.  \n\n\nI will say, if you walked in on it and found out at 18, I do wonder whether things were happening before that. It's sadly extremely common these days for people underage to have sending nudes on the internet just... normalised for them by creepy dudes they encounter. And it fucking hurts them later in life when they work out their sense of normal in a relationship is warped as a result and it makes them unhappy and have strings of toxic partners. Its fucking awful. Same consequences as any other sexual abuse. So I truly hope your daughter is not in that boat.  \n\n\nHopefully that hasn't happened. But whether it has or it hasn't, you did the only thing you could do.

So far I\u2019ve listened. Drug use and alcohol use are very common in sex work circles- that\u2019s not to demonize them either, but it\u2019s true. She made a choice to start using as well.

I do think your reasons for not pushing back harder were selfish in nature, but as a legal adult she is also responsible for the choices she made. as a parent though as much as I know I couldnt force my 18 year old out of something if damn sure try a lot harder than you did, and at the very least regularly check in to make sure she was ok. this business is very risky and the fact you didn\u2019t even know she had a drug problem or was blowing through tons of money shows you were not an involved parent. you both messed up", "You\u2019re not at fault in any kinda way!

You can \"love and support\" if you wanted swimming but she chose tennis.\n\nBut, she chose ***ONLYFANS***.  You don't need to \"love and support\".

I know things are hard, and I know how much easier having a little cash would be.  I really do.  But, I'd prefer that you put your time and energy into college (community college? GED?) because those are more likely to give you better opportunities.  OF has very little room for growth; only the absolute luckiest make it.

How many porn actresses aren't being forced into things they don't feel comfortable with and being coherented into not saying anything, \"for fear of breaking contract.\" I didn't even fucking do sex work, I worked next to these woman for years. Watched them crumb and cried, drove them home, listened and told them there was hope for a better future, and stayed as support even after they left the industry.
