When my daughter (now 21F) was 18, I found out she had an OnlyFans account, by accidentaly walking in on her taking photos of herself. I was very angry and shocked, but, once I got a bit more cool-headed, I realised that I probably wouldn't be able to stop her even if I tried. I sat her down and tried to explain what my concerns were, and how she should give this decision a lot of thought, but I emphasised that I would still love and support her even if she decided to continue, since she was old enough to make decisions for herself. I felt a lot of sympathy for her, because as a single mother I wasn't able to provide for her the nice life she deserved growing up. We were living in a one-bedroom appartment for many years, frequently skipping meals to make ends meet. The few hundred extra dollars in her pocket every month from OnlyFans made a real difference to her happiness: she was able to go out with her friends to concerts, buy nicer clothes and makeup, and didn't have to work her weekend job.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, and OnlyFans exploded in popularity, she went from making a few hundred dollars a month to a few thousand. Over those months, OnlyFans became a full-time career for her. When restrictions eased up, she started performing hardcore content, and, with her new-found money, was able to afford a lavish (by my standards at least) style of living. She rented a nice place of her own, partied a lot, and seemed to be enjoying her life.\n\nLast week, she showed up at my place, in tears. She was broke, and she admitted that she'd developed a drug problem. She screamed at me, telling me I'd ruined her life and that I should've stopped her from using OnlyFans when she was 18. She called me irresponsible, lazy (for not making more money so that she \"wouldn't have had to turn to OnlyFans\") and a horrible mother. She told me that every relationship she ever cared about ended when the guy found out what she did for a living, and that I shouldn't have \"stood by applauding while she ruined her own life.\" Her comments really hurt me, and I have been crying non-stop for the past week pretty much.\n\nI'm torturing myself with these thoughts, and I just want to know where I stand. I'm worried I let my daughter down, and that she's right and I'm a terrible mother. But I also feel intensely angry at her, like I'll go crazy unless scream \"I told you so\" and \"you didn't listen\" at her. Was I an asshole mother, or should I be justifiably angry about how she's handled her life?", "created_utc": 1683743288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dz23y/aita_because_i_didnt_do_enough_to_discourage_my/", "score": 661, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nor did you stand by \"applauding,\" being supportive of your child's choices is difficult sometimes, but you had zero control at that point.  Stand strong mom, you did NOTHING wrong.  Stop beating yourself up about the past too, you did your best with what you had, a one-bedroom is better than a box on the street. Skipping meals is better than days without food.  She needs to be responsible now and fix her own life by making smarter choices.  NTA Good luck!", ">since she was old enough to make decisions for herself.\n\nShe was 18. You gave her the freedom to make adult decisions as an adult. Her poor decisions from that point on are on her shoulders, not yours.\n\nYou didn't get her addicted to drugs.

The consequences are on her.", "NTA you didn\u2019t encourage her to start doing porn, just found out about it and didn\u2019t judge her too harshly. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYou treated her as an adult and shared your concerns.

There's lots of mature, stable guys who aren't so judgemental. \n\nSex work is work. And honestly it sounds like what really \"ruined her life\" was hardcore drugs, not her onlyfans. You can argue that OF allowed her to afford drugs, but... Most people with some extra cash don't just develop drug addiction. \n\nThere's many factors, like genetic predisposition and who your friends are. She probably got exposed at parties with her trusted friends. \n\nWhat she needs now is rehab and recovery. It's not your fault she's in this bad place, it's not your fault that you're poor.

Which is sad because they are still developing, and don't have any experience in the real world yet.\n\nBut from your daughters pov you maybe should have pushed harder. And explained the real repercussions that will go along with pornography. Mainly being that most people will not want to date or marry someone that has produced and sold pornography. And a lot of companies will not hire someone, or will terminate someone else if they find out that they had an only fans. And it can severely impact their future in a massively negative way, for a small amount of money for a short amount of time.\n\nIt really needs to be hammered into kids that anything posted to the internet lasts forever. And if it is controversial in anyway, most career opportunities can be closed off to you.  And what is acceptable in society today may not be acceptable in 10-15 years. And the odds of really hitting it big are extremely low. And even if they do, it normally does not last very long.", "NAH. \n\nHonestly, people think that OnlyFans and other forms of virtual sex work aren't traumatizing, but they can be. It sounds like things were fine for her at first but to keep up with the market she had to escalate beyond her comfort zone, and it affected her really badly. I think she's probably really screwed up by her experience and wishes she had never done it. She sees you as someone who could have stopped her but didn't, and she's upset about it. I think she feels she wasn't mature or informed enough to make the decision and feels there should have been something in place to protect her--in this case you. And she feels like you didn't. I don't think she's TA, I think she's just processing trauma.\n\nAlso I don't think you're TA for not stopping her. She was an adult, what could you do to stop her? If you actually restricted her access to the internet and such it would have caused a massive rift in your relationship. You laid out your concerns and she ignored them.", "Honestly, I don't even think her having an OF was any part of the problem here. The problem was a girl who grew up poor suddenly having access to a significant amount of money. If after high school she'd suddenly gotten a high paying job that wasn't OF, there's every chance things would have turned out the exact same way.\n\nI think the failing here, and it's not your failing, is that she never learned financial responsibility.\n\nAs for her not being able to hold down a relationship because of being an OF model... well it's really just a fact of our society that sex workers get treated like shit. It's awful and it needs to change but if that's your line of work, that's really just how it goes. Personally speaking, I'd tell her to look at it a different way. Does she really want to be in a relationship with someone who's so insecure that he'd treat her like that just for her profession. It may be harder on her but there are dudes who are supportive of their partner's sex work. Hell, she could get together with a male sex worker and making content could become a couples thing for them.\n\nIt's an unfortunate fact that some areas of life are just harder for sex workers but that doesn't mean the profession itself is bad, just how society treats people who do it.\n\nI'd see if you can find her a SW friendly therapist who can talk through these issues with her and if you know any financial planners you can trust it wouldn't hurt to set her up with one so she can better manage her money. If she's looking to get clean from her drug habit I'd do some research in NA groups in your area or rehab if that's something she can afford and/or needs.\n\nThe vast share of her unhappiness is coming from suddenly having more cash than she knew what to do with and using it irresponsibly. I got an inheritance of 12k when I was fourteen and it took me six months to spend 8k of it. Kids from poor families who suddenly come into money often go overboard.\n\nYou're not a bad parent for supporting her starting an OFs but now that you know all the problems she's been facing, you do have the opportunity to help her.", "NTA\n\nShe just needs someone to blame, and sadly, it's you. You voiced your concerns and worries. She said she was an adult and wanted to sell herself for some extra money. That's not your fault. Being a single mom in this economy is rough. You did what you could, and that's all that matters. This isn't your fault. \n\nMost women I know have an OFs, even ones who grew up with a silver spoon in their mouth. It's just the latest thing people do because it's a quick way to make an extra buck without doing a lot of work.", "NTA, you talked to her already and she still decided to take that route, she could\u2019ve carried on doing it without the drugs but decided to use them. It\u2019s not your fault at all, do not blame yourself, but support her now, she sounds angry and is taking it out on you, right now she needs her mother and that\u2019s what matters to get her back on her feet", "NTA\n\nShe was going to do it no matter what or how you said it to her. You voiced your concerns and treated her like the adult she was.\n\nShe doesn't get to blame you for her bad decisions.", "NTA. Your daughter is an adult. Adult take responsibility for their decisions. It\u2019s not your decision, hence you are not responsible.", "NTA. Ironically, she's screaming at you because you are a loving and supportive parent who creates a safe space for her to have feelings. If you were a bad parent, she wouldn't be crying to you about her choices. \n\nDo your best. Help her find a rehab, participate in family therapy, keep loving her, but try to grey rock her when she blames you for her choices.", "NTA. You did what you could. You believed she wouldn\u2019t have changed if you had tried more, based on your years of experience as her mother. She\u2019s ruined her own life and is looking for a scapegoat.", "NTA\n\nBut neither is your daughter. I definitely wouldn't be taking what she says to heart. She just admitted she has been suffering from a drug problem. Chances are, she's confused, scared, going through withdrawals, etc. She doesn't know what to do or say. Has she made some mistakes? Absolutely. But what she needs right now is her mother to be there for her and help her through the problems.\n\nDon't judge. Don't play the \"I told you so\" game. Don't be heartless and tell her she \"made her choices\" or try to control anything. This is the time to show compassion and support for her. Don't revel in being right or anything of that crap. Just be a loving mother.", "NTA, she was 18. If you said no, she may have just left home, moved in with someone, and did OF (and/or worse) there.\n\nIs she addicted to drugs? Does she sincerely want help to stop, if she is? You may be able to encourage her in that respect. My only advice her would be not to enable her habit. \n\nIs she was selling \"content\" then there are videos of her out in the either. Once something goes online it's out in the world permanently. Most guys don't want to see their girl doing hard core sex with other men so it's not surprising they all leave after they find out. \n\nI don't know how once doing OF will effect her job search. I think all hiring managers do a web search on possible employees before they hire. \n\nGood luck, those decisions are on her not you.", "NTA. Like you mentioned, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop her regardless plus she\u2019s an adult. You cautioned her, she ignored that to live her current lifestyle and now that she realizes she fucked up, she wants to point the finger rather than take accountability for her actions. Sounds like she needs to grow up", "NTA. \n\nShe was an adult and made adult choices. She has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA, its a situation where you are damned if you do or damned if you don't. If you had your foot down, I seriously doubt she would have stopped, and you two would not have had much of a relationship at that point. Since you treated her like an adult, she decided that it's easier to blame you for her choices than to take responsibility for herself. you laid out your concerns and thrn told her whatever she chose, you will still love her. It can't get any better than that between a parent and child.", "NTA. \n\nThis may sound harsh, but there are plenty of people who work in the sex industry that do not develop a drug problem or go broke. She decided to enter the sex industry through a very unstructured way: OnlyFans. \n\nTraditionally, someone would enter the sex field through interaction with studios and other seasoned performers. Now I\u2019m not going to sit here and say that way is perfect or safe. However, it does give people access to a community and people who have been in that industry for many years that can guide them and give them advice on how to operate appropriately and to build boundaries and safety nets. Once again, I am not seen that everybody is going to be a good and perfect person. But I am saying that there is knowledge with in that community. There are people who can monitor you, pull you aside and tell you if you need to change shit up real quick.\n\nThere have been plenty of sex workers on social media who continuously warn young people about entering the industry through OF. They continuously warn young people and tell them to think very carefully about whether or not this is an industry they want to be in. She had you warn her, there were plenty of people online who would\u2019ve been warning her. But she decided to play around and this is what happens when you enter a very unforgiving industry with no game plan.\n\nEssentially, she decided to become a freelance sex worker in a harsh industry. You warned her about this path. It is very unfortunate that she has a drug problem now. I do not believe addiction is caused by low morals, it is a chemical addiction. It is a medical condition. However, you are not responsible for her developing a drug habit.", "NTA. She made a decision to start an OF account and you told her your concerns and worries. She was an adult and ultimately was going to do what she wanted to do. Every parent on earth is going to tell their son/daughter their concerns about that.\n\nHer having an OF =\\\\= becoming a drug addict and blowing through her money. Those were her decisions to be irresponsible with her new lifestyle/money/decisions. I'm certain there are plenty of people with OF accounts who do not become drug addicts, go broke, or have bad dating experiences. Attempting to blame her bad decisions that led to her current situation on you is a lazy cop out.\n\nShe was enough of an adult to decide what to put of herself on the internet, she's enough of an adult to be responsible for her actions and choices afterwards. She cannot put on you that she, as an adult, decided to be on OF and that the men she met did not want to date someone who is creating internet porn.\n\nYou can, as her mom, try to help her now get back on her feet, work through the addiction issues and overcome them, get clean, and set herself back on track in life. That is what family does. But where she is now and the fallout from that is completely on her.", "NTA  \n\n\nAnd I know it won't make it hurt any less, but it's her drug-fuelled brain talking. \n\nYou're not a terrible mother. She is an adult. You did voice your concerns but at the end of the day she made that choice and the roads it led her down. And I'm not casting judgement on OF at all - people do what they want with their own bodies and good luck to them. But blaming you for her poor decisions and management of her own money, no, that's on her.\n\nIs she in rehab? I think the only way forward is for her to get clean and you can support her in that. But please do not take on HER responsibility for her own actions. She needs help and therapy for sure, but you could benefit from therapy too.\n\nWishing you both all the best.", "NTA, this is the fault of an economic system that incentivizes attractive young people to sell their bodies on the internet for short term financial gains.  There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with adult content or Onlyfans and I myself support the legitimacy of sexwork as a profession, but the level to which this is now immediately available to young people as soon as they turn 18 and is often far more lucrative than typical means of employment, makes it feel like as a society we are pimping out our young adults in an almost predatory manner.  It generally requires significantly less effort and vision than other forms of content creation, and has a low bar for entry, you can start by selling feet pics.  I\u2019m all for people sharing their self expression however they wish, but with economic and housing situations being what they are I do feel like there in immense pressure on young people today to seek an easy way to establish financial stability, I worry that more and more people are participating in sexwork not out of genuine desire to work in that field, but due to them seeing it as their best chance of a way out financially. This has always been a problem, but with modern technology and services is just feels more accessible to everyone than ever.\n\nWhat happened to your daughter was very unfortunate, but you should not under any circumstances blame yourself for how things have unfolded.  Her drug use seems to be the biggest issue here, but her having some regret about the lifestyle she chose is completely understandable she got in at a young age and ignored your warnings.  She\u2019s just out of line blaming it on you.", "NTA but i also want to add, I have family with drug addictions and they lash out. They dont mean it. Yes it hurts but try to remember that it is partially the drugs and the shame talking and she probably doesnt truly believe it. People lash out at the ones they love when they're struggling like that, some do it to shift the blame because they want no responsibility, some do it to push you away because it gives them an excuse to not get better and get worse instead because \"what else can i lose\" mindset. I'm really sorry youre going through this. I hope she will get help", "NTA\n\nPlenty of women made a lot of money on Onlyfans and didn't ruin their lives with subsequent bad choices or surround themselves with bad people.\n\nBlaming Onlyfans is just an excuse to downplay all the other piss poor decisions she actually made because it's an easy scapegoat.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s the drug problem talking. She\u2019s broke, someone needs blamed. This is how the story goes. All you can do now is support her getting sober.", "NTA. \n\n1. Her doing OF has nothing to do with her doing drugs and \"ruining her life.\"\n\n2. You couldn't have talked her out of it. She was already doing it anyway. \n\n3. Some people are going to mind that sort of job, some aren't. Just like some people only want to date virgins or someone that doesn't have tattoos or whatever.\n There are plenty of people doing OF that are in relationships, married, or even doing a joint account with their S/O. IMO that just points to that dude not being the one for her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Again, not on you.\n\n\n\nI have problems with people under a certain age doing OF but that's more to do with society's opinion on when adulthood starts vs when the brain typically matures fully and impulse control and all that settles more. However, again, she'd already started and you voiced your concerns. I don't think you could have stopped her either way. \n\nIt can be hard to take accountability for our actions at times and it sounds like that's where she is. Don't stress out listening to her blaming you. Just do what you can to help her through the drug problems and take accountability for herself and go from there.", "Hey who doesn\u2019t support their daughters career in porn? Ayth? No. But kinda morally bankrupt, yes.", "Yikes this took a turn. \n\nI think in our modern era onlyfans should be accepted as a normal career path.

If you want her to keep her own place, and you can pay some of the rent, maybe offer to help, but I don't think she'll get better that way. I didn't.

That doesn\u2019t make them judgmental. \nBut in the end most of those people were able to make an informed decision about wether or not they wanted to persue something with them or not and she did not give them that choice.", ">As for her not being able to hold down a relationship because of being an OF model... well it's really just a fact of our society that sex workers get treated like shit.\n\nIs not wanting to date a sex worker, especially one who does hardcore content treating them like shit though? I'd imagine in most monogamous relationships that would be a nonstarter.", "Christ dude, do you know anything about teenagers, especially when they're 18? You can try to tell them that they shouldn't do something, but saying they're not allowed to do something will only make them want to do it further and is futile.", "what do you suggest OP should have done to stop her? 18 is legally an adult and she made a choice that was legally and morally hers to take. OP supported her daughter rather than lash out and ruin the relationship. the end result would have been the same except if there was no relationship where would OP\u2019s daughter have gone to for help?", ">\\>I think in our modern era onlyfans should be accepted as a normal career path. How is it any different from YouTube?   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>because its porn. Your selling away your sexual intimacy of course that's not a good thing.", "not even remotely funny, even when being sarcastic.", "Also, there was nothing you could do about it. She was 18. \n\nThe work needed to happen in all the years prior to her 18th to hopefully ensure she wouldn\u2019t consider that as a career option.", "Of course not, your brain doesn\u2019t stop developing until 24, 25? But that makes no difference to an 18 year old. They can legally do as they wish and their parents can\u2019t stop it, for most 18 years olds that goes to their heads pretty quickly.", "There is a reason why alcohol is illegal to buy until 21. (At least in America.", "This", "Also, please know as a daughter who at one time also had a drug problem, she\u2019s talking out her ass. Drug addicts will say ANYTHING to hurt others, especially when broke and dealing with withdraw. I am willing to bet when she\u2019s sober, with a sober mind she is going to regret those words. She\u2019s going to need you, and I am glad you\u2019re one of those amazing mothers that will be there for her.\n\nEdit to add : NTA", "Even if you'd cut off her phone she could have bought another one and gotten her own phone plan. This isn't your fault.", "This very much. As a former addict, a lot of times we blame people for our choices even if they had little or nothing to do with our mistakes. It can be difficult when going sober or handling consequences to admit your own faults.\n\nYou are not the asshole. Get them therapy if you can or other form of help. I am sorry.", "OP is a mom. I don't understand how people confuse genders when it's clearly written.", "The consequences and vices that come with doing pornography is so harsh but some people don't see that and see it as a career. There are very few porn actors that make it big time and even fewer that have healthy lives. The stigma of porn is still there, just because we are more accepting as a society doesn't mean that the real life consequences (partners not wanting to date you, drug use in the porn industry, risk of STDS, etc) don't exist. I feel for the girl but how much media shows that girls who unfortunately get their nudes leaked have negative consequences, nevermind doing porn", "I've found that people who look down on sex workers tend to be, shall we say, morally challenged in other areas. (Especially if they use porn! So you want the fruit of their labor, but you don't think they should get paid well and treated with respect because of their job. Hypocritical.)\n\nIf how much sex someone has makes you think they're less of a person, that's definitely on you.", "Yes.\n\nTelling women they don't deserve a relationship because of their job is treating them like shit. That is exactly what every guy is telling her when they walk out on the relationship after finding out her job.\n\nThat treatment is one born out of insecurity and mistrust. If you've ever dated a sex worker, you know there's a pretty big difference between what they do on camera and what they do in the bedroom with you. Having sex and making love are worlds apart. Honestly, it should be reassuring to know that a woman with a lot of experience who could reasonable get any guy to sleep with her wants to come home to you. That emotional connection should mean more than the mundane action of sex and the fact that it doesn't is a serious problem with out society \n\nWe also don't know what is meant by \"hardcore content\". Arranging multiple people for an OF shoot is a lot of work. There's every chance it just means she's being explicit but she's still alone. Plenty of OF models make great money being just them and the camera because it makes the viewers feel more connected to them than if there was a guy in the shoot. If your girl is just m*sturbating for the camera I don't think monogamy even comes into it.", "Yes, sadly there was not much if anything she could do at all for the daughter, kids nowadays do these things", "Reality is, OnlyFans made her money, but obviously didn't make her happy. It's not that you gave bad advice, it's that it wasn't followed correctly.", "it's not your fault op. your daughter unfortunately fell victim to the trappings of everyone who grew up poor and suddenly found themselves with a great deal of money, in a short time span. ultimately the success brought on the pandemic may have been more of a curse than anything. she started making to much to quickly, and it went to her head and she made many poor decisions. hopefully in time she'll come to accept that it was her own choices that lead her to where she is now.", "It's never too late to start learning. r/personalfinance is a great place to start. I'm concerned my mother will have almost nothing to look forward to in retirement by ignoring things like IRAs and 401ks for the temporary gratification irresponsible spending elicits.\n\nIrresponsible drug use specifically almost always leads to feelings of emptiness and is a bottomless pit for ones capital.", "I think you meant well, but the phrase \u201cfollow your heart\u201d is too amorphous of an advice to give for someone in an age range where most of their choices are impulsive and purely emotional and not based on actual experience. Anybody can claim that anything is them \u201cfollowing their heart\u201d. To be clear, I don\u2019t think any of this is your fault. Im just saying we should analyze what we say to each other a little more and understand what it might mean to people at different points in their lives. Life isn\u2019t a \u201cLive. Laugh. Love.\u201d doormat. Even if they don\u2019t listen, we got to shoot it straight with these youngsters. They are foolish by nature. So much shit at a young age that seems meaningful is really not at all once you have the perspective and benefit of hindsight.", "INFO: Did you ever benefit from your daughter's work? Did she give you money?", "Ok I originally thought talking out her ass said taking it up the ass", "Yeah it\u2019s literally the second sentence wtf. Do people even read these or do they just go with the popular opinion?", "I don\u2019t believe porn is healthy.", "\"Hardcore\" obviously means she's having sex with someone else on camera. You typed a lot to justify something that most people would not find acceptable in a committed or monogamous relationship. Many women find porn consumption unappealing, let alone actually making it.", "So boundaries don't matter then.", "It's abusive for men to have boundaries. More news at 11. \n\nNo one is owed a relationship. You don't get to tell men how they should feel about dating sex workers.", "Motivated Perception!", "That means they have to read the comments which all describe her as mom. I think they just flip a coin and pick a random comment to comment on."]}
