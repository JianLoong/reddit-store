When my daughter (now 21F) was 18, I found out she had an OnlyFans account, by accidentaly walking in on her taking photos of herself. I was very angry and shocked, but, once I got a bit more cool-headed, I realised that I probably wouldn't be able to stop her even if I tried. I sat her down and tried to explain what my concerns were, and how she should give this decision a lot of thought, but I emphasised that I would still love and support her even if she decided to continue, since she was old enough to make decisions for herself. I felt a lot of sympathy for her, because as a single mother I wasn't able to provide for her the nice life she deserved growing up. We were living in a one-bedroom appartment for many years, frequently skipping meals to make ends meet. The few hundred extra dollars in her pocket every month from OnlyFans made a real difference to her happiness: she was able to go out with her friends to concerts, buy nicer clothes and makeup, and didn't have to work her weekend job.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, and OnlyFans exploded in popularity, she went from making a few hundred dollars a month to a few thousand. Over those months, OnlyFans became a full-time career for her. When restrictions eased up, she started performing hardcore content, and, with her new-found money, was able to afford a lavish (by my standards at least) style of living. She rented a nice place of her own, partied a lot, and seemed to be enjoying her life.\n\nLast week, she showed up at my place, in tears. She was broke, and she admitted that she'd developed a drug problem. She screamed at me, telling me I'd ruined her life and that I should've stopped her from using OnlyFans when she was 18. She called me irresponsible, lazy (for not making more money so that she \"wouldn't have had to turn to OnlyFans\") and a horrible mother. She told me that every relationship she ever cared about ended when the guy found out what she did for a living, and that I shouldn't have \"stood by applauding while she ruined her own life.\" Her comments really hurt me, and I have been crying non-stop for the past week pretty much.\n\nI'm torturing myself with these thoughts, and I just want to know where I stand. I'm worried I let my daughter down, and that she's right and I'm a terrible mother. But I also feel intensely angry at her, like I'll go crazy unless scream \"I told you so\" and \"you didn't listen\" at her. Was I an asshole mother, or should I be justifiably angry about how she's handled her life?", "created_utc": 1683743288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dz23y/aita_because_i_didnt_do_enough_to_discourage_my/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's certainly not your fault that the guys she CHOOSE to date didn't stay with her because they have their own expectation of who they want to be with.  Nor did you stand by \"applauding,\" being supportive of your child's choices is difficult sometimes, but you had zero control at that point.  Stand strong mom, you did NOTHING wrong.  Stop beating yourself up about the past too, you did your best with what you had, a one-bedroom is better than a box on the street. Skipping meals is better than days without food.  She needs to be responsible now and fix her own life by making smarter choices.  NTA Good luck!", ">since she was old enough to make decisions for herself.\n\nShe was 18. You gave her the freedom to make adult decisions as an adult. Her poor decisions from that point on are on her shoulders, not yours.\n\nYou didn't get her addicted to drugs. You (presumably) didn't tell her partners about her OF and cause them to leave.\n\nAre you justified in being angry? Sure. Is it wrong to wish things went differently? Of course not. But it's not fair for her to blame you\n\nTL;DR - NTA. She made decisions as an adult woman. The consequences are on her.", "NTA you didn\u2019t encourage her to start doing porn, just found out about it and didn\u2019t judge her too harshly. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYou treated her as an adult and shared your concerns. If she chose to do otherwise there\u2019s not much you could have done short of taking away all her devices which would have also ended poorly and most likely led to her resenting/blaming you anyways. \n\nImo this is a good lesson in personal responsibility. Having said that you could still help her now if you\u2019re both willing and use this as an opportunity for growth.", "NTA. You are not a terrible mother.\n\nIt is not your fault that she made the choices she did. Eventually, she'll have to come to terms with that. Right now, she's blaming you because facing that reality is **hard**.\n\nAlso, quite frankly, none of the bad outcomes here seem like they directly descended from her job anyway. Being an OnlyFans content creator does not mean you have to do drugs. It does not mean you have to be fiscally irresponsible. Those are the mistakes she, as an independent adult, made herself.\n\nNow the best thing you can do is to be sure she knows that you still love her, and to try to help her find the help (which may include therapy and addiction recovery) that she may need going forward.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever if she's always been decent and level headed it could just be the drugs talking right now, try not to hold it against her. She's obviously in a shit situation and looking for someone to blame instead of owning up to her mistakes.", "NTA. Once she was getting the fast/easy money she wouldn\u2019t have listened to you anyways. She now has to live with the consequences of her actions and having all of that intimate stuff out there. Now she knows why you should be cautious when considering starting sex work especially if you don\u2019t consider all of the implications. You are not at fault for anything and she is just lashing out because she doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for her actions and it\u2019s easier to blame you than accept she made bad decisions. If you told her not todo it she would have just gotten pissed at you and continued anyways so it\u2019s a no win situation on your end.", "NTA\n\nShe was an adult and you treated her like one and now she's finding out what its like to live with the consequences of her actions. If she hadnt been making that much money doing OF but something else, she would have probably still followed the same trajectory. \n\nThe problem was with how she handled and spent the money once she earned it, not because of her job.", "Nta - whatever choices she made as an adult are her choices. You didn't force her to do only fans, she said she thought about it long and hard, you didn't force her to move out, you didn't shove drugs at her. I'm sure it's devastating to hear all those nasty things from her but they're coming from her own sense of failure and she's unfairly lashing out at you for her own mistakes.", "NTA, her decisions are hers alone. She was an adult she made her own bed.", "NTA \n\nAn adult made adult choices.  Bad ones but they were her choices.  You didn't force the drugs in here system or even to start an OF.", "NTA. You were cautiously supportive of her, you let her know the dangers of what she was doing, but she\u2019s an adult and made her own decisions and seemed to be thriving until she wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s not your fault.\n\nI know you will likely be unable to unhear the awful things she said to you, but please know that addicts can be extremely manipulative and will say the things they know will hurt you to your core. Oftentimes these things aren\u2019t even true and aren\u2019t what the addict truly believes, but she is hurting because of her own decisions so in turn, she is hurting you. My friend\u2019s kid is around the age of yours & got addicted to heroin and has done the same thing. Usually it\u2019s an attempt to guilt her into sending money & when she doesn\u2019t, the hurtful comments come. It\u2019s all manipulation. So she\u2019s unfortunately had to learn to love from a distance to preserve her own wellbeing.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve done the best you possibly could have in this situation and even if you think you could\u2019ve done something better, you can\u2019t get in a time machine and change anything. Just keep doing your best and take care of yourself.", "NTA, I get that she might feel upset that her choice hasn't worked out for her. But she was an adult, legally, and honestly there's no way you could stop her. \n\nIf all the guys she's dated dump her over her sex work, honestly that's on them. There's lots of mature, stable guys who aren't so judgemental. \n\nSex work is work. And honestly it sounds like what really \"ruined her life\" was hardcore drugs, not her onlyfans. You can argue that OF allowed her to afford drugs, but... Most people with some extra cash don't just develop drug addiction. \n\nThere's many factors, like genetic predisposition and who your friends are. She probably got exposed at parties with her trusted friends. \n\nWhat she needs now is rehab and recovery. It's not your fault she's in this bad place, it's not your fault that you're poor. If you worked OF when she was a kid to pay for more things she probably would have accused you of ruining her life by being embarrassing. \n\nAnyway, I wish you both the best and hope your daughter recovers well.", "NTA\n\nshe's looking for someone to blame and she would've kept doing it anyways if you told her to stop. Partying life has caught up to her and she's avoiding any responsibilities to it. Classic drug addict. Ask her if she needs a rehab or NA meeting to go to. They will help her make sense of her decisions", "First off I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s got a drug problem, I hope she gets better \u2764\ufe0fbut it\u2019s not your fault! You sound like a great mother honestly who tried her hardest to give her child a good upbringing even tho it\u2019s not easy being a single mum. I think you reacted pretty well to her having OF, my parents certainly wouldn\u2019t have done that :/ however you told her your worries and were calm, she\u2019s an adult and can control herself and her actions so it\u2019s not your fault at all. You told her your qualms, she did her own thing and is probably just wanting to not be responsible or hold herself accountable.

You told her your concerns about OF at the time, but you're right that you couldn't have stopped her.  And that was 2-3 years ago.  Her drug problem since then is not your fault.  Her relationship problems are not your fault.  She should apologize to you for saying so, and she probably will eventually.  Good luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Dont pay much mind to what folks in the throes of addiction say. They're not in their right mind, but also YTA because come on dude your her mother, her only role model and you were like I'll be supportive of you essentially prostituting yourself online. Seriously who does that she was 18. 18 DUDE! thats practically a child she's in no way grown enough to be deciding shit like getting into \"soft\" prostituting. You really should have stepped up and been extremely firm with her. Judging by ur reaction I'm guessing you've always been a kind and empathetic mother so it stand to reason if you blew the hell up over this. It would really hit home for ur kid because you never react like that. Your her mother comon now it's ur responsibility to raise her right. And you supported not only the only fans but her partying lifestyle, what was that? Were you living vicariously through her? Definitely YTA", "NTA\n\nSingle mom, bound to happen, many such cases", "What's the link OP?  \n\n\nAlso this isn't real.", "NTA \n\nIt is funny though that she says no guy wants to be with her after finding out she does or did OF, because I feel the exact same way.", "NTA - you did what you thought what best, which was support her at the time she began OnlyFans.  Had you tried to stop her, she would have done it anyway (as you suggested she would) and would have been resentful of you.  \n\nYou did the right thing - and she is learning that there are consequences to her actions.", "NTA\n\nYou explained your concerns but were supportive of her decision. Nobody made her do it, nobody made her move to more hard-core content, and nobody made her do drugs. Those are all her own choices.", "She grown, that\u2019s all choices she made.", "NTA. You were probably right that you wouldn't have been able to stop her. She was legally an adult. At most, you could have kicked her out of your house, but as you say, she was already making money and could have gotten her own place and had even less of your guidance.\n\nOnlyFans did not make her do drugs, although it might have given her the opportunity. Also, she can stop one or both now and probably won't have to tell people about her past if she doesn't want to.", "NTA, you did the right thing in talking to her once you found our and expressing your concerns. I could bet my life savings she wouldn't have had the same reaction if she never went broke and made even more money down the line. She would have praised you for never making her take it down", "NTA. What gets me is that she says she has a drug problem but still refuses to accept responsibility. She was 18 when she started. She was an adult who made her own choice. She partied away her money, that's not on you at all", "NTA. She put you in a difficult spot, you made the best of it, and things didn't work out for her. Things just don't, sometimes.", "NTA. She had a fantastic life and couldn't deal with it. Often people can't deal with too much success too fast.

And nothing of this is your fault.", "> She screamed at me, telling me I'd ruined her life and that I should've stopped her from using OnlyFans when she was 18.\n\nD'you know what would've happened if you'd done that? She'd have screamed at you with something along the lines of \"I'm an adult and can make my own decisions if I want to and you're being a controlling parent and ruining my life and not supporting me\".\n\nThe hurtful things she's saying are her lashing out, because it's much easier to blame others, than to rationally accept that you've not always made the decisions and a lot of the responsibility for the hole you're in now is your own.\n\nNTA - it's not a parent's role to tell their adult child - especially one who's moved out! - what they can or cannot do. Be there and support her when she realises she needs that. Right now, she has to work through the hard fact that she's made some dumb choices (not necessarily the Onlyfans part - but not having saved, and especially having taken up drugs), and those choices are on her and she needs to work through them.", "NTA. Her body, her choice. She was an adult and made adult choices. \nYou sat down with her and gave your concerns about what she was doing, then she used it as a guide to live her life. Might sound harsh, but you need to be straight with her. Tough love I think is required", "you told her your concerns, she did it anyway, she's unhappy with how it turned out and lashed out at you. that doesn't mean you're an asshole for not being harsher when you found out but it doesn't mean you should be angry at her for being 18 and wanting financial freedom, then not being able to navigate that. it's not fair that she lashed out at you, but that's parenting. it sounds like she's going to learn a lot from this experience and you should try to support her through that instead of letting it become an even bigger source of conflict.", "NTA. you spoke your concerns, she still made her choices. she was the one who decided to start drugs, you didn\u2019t tell her to do it. she\u2019s an adult, she has to take responsibility.", "It's not your fault. Could you have done different? Yes. Would it have helped? Who knows. She was an adult, she made her decisions, she got hooked on drugs. If she keeps blaming others, she'll literally ***never*** get any better, so your only job right now is to try and help here here and now.", "Lmao damn that\u2019s hilarious \ud83d\ude06", "Nothing you could have said would\u2019ve changed her mind and she probably would\u2019ve just doubled down, you know that.

She probably sees zero ways forward right now and that\u2019s why she is so scared and so angry at you. She needs to see she has a path forward. \n\nI did cam stuff when I was in college because I was broke. I went off the rails with binge drinking and experimenting with drugs, too. You would never know that about me now, though. She can\u2019t see her path yet, you need to be the mom and shine a light on it for her so she can put her feet on the ground and start putting on foot in front of the other. Getting counseling - you need to be very careful here though and find a counselor with a background in addiction and one familiar with sex work - especially if you are in an area that is particularly conservative, virtual therapy may be a better bet, because you do NOT want to have her end up with someone who will do even more damage.\n\nNTA", "I agree with the fact that you did sit down and talk to her once.\n\nDid you ever speak to her about budgeting,  savings, and goals?\n\nDid you make a point of talking ethics, responsibilities, education,  and culture when she was at various ages? Did you ever talk to her on vices that led to addiction? \n\nAt this point talk about 12 step programs and rehabs. And have all those other conversations.", "I considered cutting off her phone, but I thought that if I did that she'd find some way to circumvent me. I would've done the same when I was her age, probably. I thought it would be better to have her do OnlyFans but as an informed decision, than to ban her and risk her continuing anyway.", "Thank you for your kind words. This means a lot to me.", "I'm not the most knowledgeable about money. I've never had the luxury of having significant savings of any sort. I've always told her she shouldn't live miserably unless she has to, but equally that it's a good idea to have something left in case of an emergency.\n\nI've tried to do right by her as much as I can. I told her that drugs always end badly, and that she should be kind and generous. There have been plenty of generous souls who took pity on us in the past, and I told her it was important to pay it forward. But most importantly, that she should follow her heart and do what makes her happy, which I've begun to think wasn't the best thing to say.\n\nThank you for your advice. I'll sit her down and talk about rehab when I'm a bit calmer.", "It's not the career choice I'd want my kid to make either, but I think you're right, she would have found a way.\n\nNot your fault. But man, tough times to be their Mom, I feel for you.", "You can educate yourself at the same time then too. Honestly learning one new thing a day is terrific.  Doesn't even matter on the subject."]}
