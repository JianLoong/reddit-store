Run. Or kick him out. Because your husband believing that your daughter is broken is far more damaging to her than any \"emo phase\" could be.", "NTA, but everyone else sure is.  There is nothing satanic about being emo.  Your husband is going to regret this later when your daughter wants nothing to do with him.", "Totally not, you daughter is learning how to express herself and trying to suppress that will only make her resent you. Also those Christian camps for \"troubled teens\" are often extremely corrupt and traumatizing. It's good to raise somebody with the capability to be defiant, that way she knows how to stand up for things that aren't right.", "YTA for letting this go on without objecting to your husband punishing her for no reason", "NTA mama stand up for your girl", "Nta.  Let your daughter be who she is.  Your husband is fighting a losing battle.  She'll likely outgrow it in her own time", "NTA in the slightest. You\u2019re a good parent for allowing your daughter to express herself, she isn\u2019t hurting anyone and it makes her happy. Your husband is a major AH for trying to force his beliefs on both of you and stifling your daughter\u2019s self-expression.", "It's not a phase mom!\n\nBut obviously NTA. I can't think of anything dumber than parents trying to discipline emo out of someone, it's almost meta.", "NTA. Your daughter is a teenager, we all went through style and attitude phases as we explored ourselves. And honestly, if she ends up there, more power to her, it sounds like it isn\u2019t negatively affecting her life beyond the AH Father. What\u2019s truly unhealthy is being forced on a life path and attitude that isn\u2019t yours, and that can screw a kid up for life.", "NTA. Letting your kid express themselves is healthy and super important! Your husband and his family sound exhausting and I would keep a close eye on everyone. And don't let your husband continue to punish your kid.", "That's some everything bulkshit they are forcing on your daughter.\n\n  Does he want a daughter that hates him?  Keep at it, she will and yall will never see her again after she turns 18.  \n\nShe is almost an adult. And sadly for Christians, most young kids are atheists.  \n\nIt's hard to brainwash kids when they have so much access to information.   That usually only works when they're isolated and have it  forced on them.  (Bible camps)\n\n\nAlso, in case you couldn't tell.  NTA", "How dare she not conform to his narrow concept of acceptable female presentation! /s NTA. Like most things at her age, it\u2019s probably just a phase. But, a surefire way to turn a phase into a defining personality trait is to try and punish her for expressing herself. Your husband is an AH and a massive one for involving your dad and MIL. As for your dad, tell him to shove his summer camp where the sun don\u2019t shine.", "NTA\n\nYou are giving space for your daughter to express her individuality, at a moment where she really needs that space to do so in her life.\n\nBut I was tempted to go with e-s-h, because it is clear you and your husband aren't on the same page when it comes to raising your daughter. And that is a major issue: she is still young, having contradictory rules/punishments from her parents will just confuse her and make her grow resentment.\n\nBut seeing how your dad and MIL are dangerous zealots people, and how you wrote that you are not \"anymore\" Christian... I'm wondering if you don't have other religious-based issues in your couple/family? From what you wrote (a very tiny window in your life, for sure), it seems that since you and your daughter aren't strict christians, this is creating a split between the two of you one side, and the rest of the family on the other side. More issues are likely to come further down the road if this is not address soon.", "NTA - I think there's a country song with lyrics something like D I V O R C E. Go give that a listen.", "NTA - You're helping her grow up and find who she feels comfortable being. Hubby needs to learn that these things are almost never about actual bad things, it's mostly just about fashion, music, and hobbies that have a common type of clothing and accessories. I went through that all black cloths, chains, rocker kinda thing back around y2k, no deep sinister reason for it, I just liked rock music, the kind of clothing that was popular at that time wiht the crowd and at HS, and slowly went on to other styles(now a middle aged regular kind of guy). You are the good parent right now, and she is being a good child with her grades and chores. Don't let that third one ruin it.", "NTA- your husband is about to cause major damage to your daughters a self esteem and feelings of self worth .\n\nYour husband is showing her that she\u2019s only of value to him as long as she does what he wants .\n\nThat\u2019s a dangerous thing to teach a young lady that her self worth depends on what a man thinks of her.\n\nPlease put her in therapy , she\u2019s gonna need it.\n\nAnd I\u2019m side eyeing you for not putting your foot down for him to stop picking on her .", "Definitely NTA.

Offer to her if she wants to sign up with [the satanic temple](https://thesatanictemple.com) which is a legally recognised religion that does far more for her rights as a young woman than Christianity ever will.", "NTA - this is normal kids stuff, they figure out who they are as people. Crazy clothes, crazy hair, doing all kinds of odd things, that is a teenager\u2019s life. You deprive her of that, and she will hate you and rebel even further. Religion bullshit needs to stop at that age, if she feels it\u2019s right for her, she will choose to be devout in her own time. You can\u2019t force it on people and it\u2019s in my opinion abuse.", "NTA. So people really believe music still can be 'satanic'? Elevator and store music is filled with yesterday's 'satanic' music.", "NTA \u2026 but I\u2019m concerned about your husbands view of the world. \n\nPart of normal teenage development is trying in new personalities and seeing what fits with your authentic self and what doesn\u2019t. By going through different phases during this time, adopting and shedding different personas, people are able to find what they find as important for and representative of their true self as an adult. It also helps the learn what it feels like to do something because it\u2019s a trend and what it feels like to do something because it\u2019s a core part of their identity. \n\nAbsolutely let your teen be an emo kid for as long or as short as she\u2019d like. Maybe remind her she can be emo AND a book nerd. Or emo AND a track star. \n\nYou husband has a very narrow view of the world and seems to believe you can judge a persons heart based in their aesthetic. That is false and harmful thinking and there is a lot to unpack there.", "NTA. I hope you and your daughter get out.", "You\u2019re not choosing what your daughter wears or how she expresses herself right now. \n\nYou\u2019re choosing how she sees her parents and who she can trust.  \n\nYou\u2019re choosing the relationship you are going to have with her as an adult. \n\nInstead of allowing your husband to punish your kid- who has done nothing wrong- why don\u2019t you take some time to learn about goth clothes and what goth people are really like. \n\nYou have a great kid. You said she was doing well in school and doing her chores. Stand up for your great kid, learn about her interests.  You will quickly figure out how to show love and give her real safety. \n\nNTA- unless you let your spouse abuse this great kid.", "NTA. And I'd be asking them why they feel such a need to control their daughters interests so much, interests that are not harming her or anyone else for that matter.", "Yeah well trying to \"fix\" her only pushes her further away and makes her more defiant, so good luck with that. When I was in high school, I was in with the goth group, and majority of them got stellar grades and were brilliant students, and all of them were hands down more respectful towards others than most other students there. They also pretty much all went on to find great careers, great partners, and happy lives. So I don't know where he gets these ideas from, but they're made up in his head because it's not what he's used to or what his image is of what he wants for her. But it's not his choice and every time he pokes and prods it's going to push her further into being more defiant.
