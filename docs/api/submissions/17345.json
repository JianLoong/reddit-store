It also helps the learn what it feels like to do something because it\u2019s a trend and what it feels like to do something because it\u2019s a core part of their identity. \n\nAbsolutely let your teen be an emo kid for as long or as short as she\u2019d like. Maybe remind her she can be emo AND a book nerd.

They also pretty much all went on to find great careers, great partners, and happy lives. So I don't know where he gets these ideas from, but they're made up in his head because it's not what he's used to or what his image is of what he wants for her.

You definitely are for even allowing ANY punishment over this.\n\nPlenty of us want through this phase back in the day, or atleast had friends that did.  Most turned out just fine.  Some still haven't let it go completely, but that's alright too.\n\nI have a coworker that has colorful skulls decorating her desk and routinely comes in with emo inspired outfits on.  She's in her upper 30s, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with who she is.", "NTA - and OMG, please don't send her to a Christian summer camp in order to reprogram her.  She's 13.  She's figuring out who she is and what she likes.  She'll maybe grow out of it, but who is she hurting?  Nobody.  Your husband needs to back off and stop punishing her for trying to be an individual before she ends the relationship with him for good.", "My Evanescence loving soul says let her be emo! \n\nI still love my bands from the early 2000s and I am a functioning, helpful (mainly) adult. She's expressing herself and finding her identity NTA for not taking issue with that.\n\nYour husband is TA though. Seriously not great that he's punishing her for literally just being a younger person.bi do feel like you should be making it clear you do not agree with the punishments and try to protect her from that.", "As a former goth (emo these days?), 13 is only the beginning. Forcing it undercover means the retaliation is that much worse.", "NTA\n\nIf she is doing what you all expect her to do (good grades, does chores, respectful, etc.), then there\u2019s no issue with what she wears. But you need to have a talk with your husband instead of sitting in the background while he hassles and punishes her for no reason. I\u2019m glad you support her, but now it\u2019s time to stick up for her. You bought her the clothes and makeup she\u2019s getting in trouble for. Don\u2019t let her get in trouble for something she has permission to do. Tell your husband it\u2019s not the outside but the lessons getting through. Also let him know he\u2019s making his standing in her life worse.", "NTA, your husband and his parents are idiots.  Yes put her in a Christian summer camp and see how that goes.  That kid will push you two further away and rebel more than you'll ever imagine if you do that.", "NTA.  If you try to do that though, you would be.  You would also likely irreparably damage any future relationship with your child.", "You and your husband both suck. Your husband, for trying to force his child, who is NOT an extension of him, who is her own person, to conform to what he believes is \u2018proper\u2019. Fuck that noise, it\u2019s clothes and makeup.  She\u2019ll (probably) go through 2847384 different styles over the next 10 years, until she finds something that just feels like her. You suck, because you\u2019re not standing up for your daughter. You\u2019re showing her that her wants don\u2019t matter, and that you\u2019re a doormat. You\u2019re teaching your daughter that you\u2019re not a safe person for her, because you\u2019ll just let your husband treat her any way he wants to. Keep this up, and the moment that she\u2019s able to walk out the door and never look back, that\u2019ll be exactly what she does.", "Self-expression, and especially self-expression in their appearance, is actually a critical developmental stage at this age.  It is tied to happiness and self-confidence.  You are not TA for that, but I think you need to be looking at how you can shield your daughter more from your ex-husband's detrimental rhetoric and punishments.  Restricting self-expression has been linked to depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.  Your ex is basically teaching your daughter that she isn't acceptable.  Is that the message you want your daughter to have?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:  I misread this (or may have mixed it up with another post) and read it as YOUR EX-HUSBAND.  Maybe that's wishful thinking cause I think he really ought to be your ex-husband.  So I assumed you were restricted in how much you could shield your daughter from this due to custody arrangements.  But you're in the same household?!?  And you aren't shielding her from your husband punishing her for her self-expression?  Then you just may be TA for that.  And while I think it's nearly certain your daughter will be cutting contact with her father the second she turns 18, if you stand idly by on this you should not be surprised to find her cutting you off, too.", "YTA for allowing your husband to act that way.\n\nYou are on a sure path to complaining about your daughter not having visited you for 10 years.", "Lol I dressed the same way at the same age and had a Christian parental figure as well. I phased out of it and she probably will too.", "YTA, stop allowing your pathetic husband to force his antiquated mythology on your daughter", "NTA-she\u2019s figuring out who she is and trying new things! Yours husband\u2019s behavior will certainly damage the relationship he has with her. Keep supporting her, mom!!", "You are going to have to break your husband of his attitude or you are going to have to choose between your husband and your daughter.

No child should be forced to be christian and certainly should NOT be sent to a crazy summer camp.  It sounds like neither of you is on the same page and he's going behind your back when you've already okayed something.  Your daughter is just expressing herself in her clothing, which is what many teenage girls like to do and is completely normal.", "ESH. Your husband for enforcing these backwards religious views on her, ditto for the grandparents, and you suck for not sticking up for your daughter and allowing your husband to punish her for simply expressing herself.", "NTA your daughter is allowed to be a distinct individual. Tell your husband emo kids don't worship satan, and to get a hold of his delusions. It sounds like you will need to be there for your daughter, with both your husband and his mother going in on her. In the long run, defending her choices as a person apart from you will benefit your mother/daughter relationship. Let your husband burn bridges if he wants (though that's not very love thy neighbor) and make sure your kid known you've got her back. It's a tough world out there, why make it tougher.", "People are predictable", "Your husband is an AH. He doesn\u2019t know it because his religion made him that way. She\u2019s rebellious?

As an elder emo, there is (was?) actually a huge Christian presence in the scene. Paramore, Underoath, and even many metal bands- Christian. Hell, even most of the local shows were AT church.

If it involved something permanent like tattoos or piercings then I'd be saying no. But, clothes, jewellery and makeup are all temporary.", "NTA. The husband needs fixing", "NTA.  Your child is a young teen, she's playing around with her look and fashion and teen subcultures.  Making a big deal out of it like your husband is is bound to backfire.  Honestly, if her emo phase is the worst he ever has to deal with, he will be a lucky parent.  You're doing it right be being generally supportive and not fighting silly battles that don't need to be fought.  If anything, you need to go a step further and discuss whether it's fair for dad to punish her for wearing clothes that he doesn't like (it's not!)
