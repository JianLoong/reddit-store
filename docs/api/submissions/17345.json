It also helps the learn what it feels like to do something because it\u2019s a trend and what it feels like to do something because it\u2019s a core part of their identity. \n\nAbsolutely let your teen be an emo kid for as long or as short as she\u2019d like. Maybe remind her she can be emo AND a book nerd.

They also pretty much all went on to find great careers, great partners, and happy lives. So I don't know where he gets these ideas from, but they're made up in his head because it's not what he's used to or what his image is of what he wants for her.

I went to church camp from the moment I turned six until I was eighteen, and a lot of my religious trauma stems from being told every night for five days that I was a sinful person headed for hell and that when the lord came soon, I\u2019d be left behind.
