{"id": 9148, "submission_id": "10tvd8v", "title": "AITA for asking my husband not to bring his kids when they are sick?", "selftext": "I (50f) have been married to my husband (53m) for 6 years. We both have kids from previous marriges. My relationship with my ex is good, his is not with his ex-wife. I have custody of my children, he doesn\u2019t (although he fought for it in the divorce) he has them every second weekends. \n\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t want him to bring his kid if they sick to us , even if it\u2019s his weekend. This has been a source of confilct ever since we married, but it is getting more tense ever since covid. His son had an ugly cough and a slight fever when he took him from his mother. I had an argument about it back then, but he said that it\u2019s okay and they did a test and it was negative. Well it wasn\u2019t. A day later his son\u2019s test was positive and then my husband, me, my two daughers and my ex-husband got sick. It was clear that his son was the source because we were very careful and didn\u2019t go out at all (we infected each other, but the son was the source). That was the end of my leniency. My daughters and ex were high risk and although fortunatelly we are fine, I didn\u2019t want to take that risk ever again. He agreed back then that he shouldn\u2019t have brought his son, and I thought the subject was settled. \n\nBut today he brought his son again with a vomiting-diarrhea kind of illness. I was very angry at him, and told him to call his ex and bring his son back to his mother tomorrow. He is argueing with me, and says that he won\u2019t, because it\u2019s his weekend. \n\nI tell him everytime my reasons: \n1. His ex lives alone, we live with my 2 daughters, so there are more people to get infected, and if one space is already infected why infect and other? \n2. A child always wants to be with their mama when they are sick (he is literally asking for her right now), and a mother will know better what to do (I never gave my sick kids to my ex)\n3. His ex is SAHM, but me and him work, and both of my daughters are university studens and have side-jobs, so will be more affected/miss more by getting sick. (For example I can\u2019t have leave, only sick-leave, which means a lower paycheck.)\n4. Me and my younger daughter works with kids, which mean we have a very week immune system, because we are always surrounded viruses that comes with children, I don\u2019t want be afraid of getting sick in my home.\nHe always dismisses me and says that he has to take his kids, because it\u2019s his weekend sick or not, and that he doesn\u2019t want conflict with his ex. \n\nSo am i wrong here to ask him to not bring the kids? I want to highlight that I don\u2019t want to shorten their time together. I always support that he spend time with his kids, and I would be okay with making up for the missed time by an other weekend, when they healed. \nEnglish is not my first language.\n\nEdit: There is a little bit misunderstandable part in my text. When I said a child alwas wants to be with their mother I meant his kids. They are asking for their mother when they are sick. Also he is bad at treating them so, I usually have to help out, which is putting me out for further opoortunity to get infected.", "created_utc": 1675555180, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tvd8v/aita_for_asking_my_husband_not_to_bring_his_kids/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, why is it okay for your younger daughter to work with kids?", "NTA - if the child is asking for their mom already while they are sick, clearly they would rather be home. While you are not wrong for wanting the child to come back to your household AFTER the illness had passed, just make sure this is explained to the child properly so they don\u2019t feel unwanted or anything of the sort.

When I was hospitalized guess who took care of our sick kids? Their dad. He may be asking for mom because she\u2019s more familiar but dad can step up and be just as good.

You can\u2019t refuse to take in your kid or be there for them when they\u2019re sick. Your husband and his son are a package deal. If you don\u2019t like it, get a divorce.

The rule of thumb is, a sick child stays in the house the kid was sick in. Getting two houses sick is just selfish and irresponsible.

I never wanted to go to my dad\u2019s house when I was ill and if the kiddo is asking for his mother, I feel awful. \n\nAlso holy shit I wouldn\u2019t want to have an illness spread through my family either if I could avoid it.

It sucks, but you also stated you work with children so the risk is there already. It just sounds like his kid will be a scapegoat and take the blame if you and your daughters get sick when you could have just as easily brought it home from work.   \nYou do what you can to keep your home clean, but that is his child that he is establishing a relationship with the best he can when he can. He's doing the honorable thing by sticking by his child even when he's sick and trying to take care of him.

It\u2019s not a crazy thing to be concerned, you\u2019re looking out for their health and they deserve to be at home without worrying if they are in danger.\n\nAt the same time, your husband deserves time with his son. Sick or not, I\u2019m sure mom likes the break/may have made plans, and I\u2019m sure dad wants to step up as a primary caretaker when his son is under the weather. Covid is an endemic now, and kids will get sick with it. It\u2019s not reasonable to hide from Covid now. \n\nIf this will be a big worry for you in the future and you cannot come to a compromise, you might have to reconsider sharing a living space. Daughters might have to mask up and stay in their rooms, or stepson will have to quarantine while he is there.

You get worse with every reading of this. He gets 4 days a month with his kids. 4 DAYS! You can deal. And that is some rank bs about working with children causing a low immune system. If anything, exposure is working similar to a vaccine for your silly self.  How selfish can you be.", "NTA I'm sympathetic to him as I am a child of divorce as well, so I understand that it can suck to not have time with your kids/ parents. That being said, he's putting quite literally everyone around him at risk by prioritizing time with his children over the people around the health of you and your children.", "YtA.  So he needs to support your kids full time in his house, sick or healthy( because they don't go to their dads when they are sick).

You sound selfish.\n\nYtA", "YTA\n\nI think your reasons are very flawed tbh. Your husband wants to be with his kids, encourage that and if they\u2019re sick oh well. It\u2019s his tone with them and maybe his ex needs a break? It\u2019s just nice that he wants to spend time with them. \n\nAlso if you\u2019re vulnerable why are you working with children? This makes no sense. Plus working with kids doesn\u2019t weaken your immune system. Sure you may get a cold more often but being with children will not weaken it. That is just flawed and incorrect science there.", "Nta\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s rough if they\u2019re sick on his weekend, since he doesn\u2019t get them that often, but it makes sense not to infect two households.\n\nMy ex and I have 50/50 custody, and there\u2019s been a couple times when the kids have stayed with one of us during the others time so we wouldn\u2019t spread illness, especially since covid hit.", "YTA.

These are his *children* and you don't get to demand that they be completely, 100% healthy every time they come to see their *father.* It's very callous of you to shun your step kids whenever they happen to come down with a bug, but it's downright cruel of you to insist your husband do the same. \n\nYou are being unfair and unrealistic. People get sick. It's a fact of life, but it doesn't mean we get to just abandon them when they do.", "I do understand the custody agreement, but it's so cruel to move a child while they're that ill! I know you said he doesn't get on with his ex, but they can't figure out another weekend? Your comment about sick kids wanting to be with mom is gross. Dad's can, and should, take care of sick kids, but I don't agree with moving kids from home to home when they're ill.\n\nIs there any way he can just keep his son in a bedroom until he's better and you just disinfect things so none of you come into contact, hopefully, with the illness (in case it is easily transferable)?\n\nHe absolutely should not have brought a Covid infected person into your house. Ideally, if the child is already infected with whatever when he's with his mom, he should stay there and limit infecting anyone else.\n\nI think I'd lean towards an ESH because it's sexist for you to think sick kids only want their mom, but the kid really shouldn't be house hopping while ill, though again, I understand with custody agreements you don't always get a say in that.", "You\u2019re reasoning is misogynistic and also false. Sick doesn\u2019t equal be with mom. That\u2019s ridiculous. He probably want to go to his mom because you\u2019re being a dick. \n\nAnd by the nature of your job you\u2019d have a better immune system. \n\nYTA. And just awful.", "I can understand quarantining with covid but to say this is the rule in general is a double-standard that shows what you think of his kids.  You are making it clear that his kids aren't members of your family because when your kids are sick, they stay in your house with you and your husband.  You don't send your kids away when they are sick only his kids aren't allowed in the house.\n\nYTA", "Question - Do your kids leave their home to go to their fathers house if they are sick at any time that your stepchildren are there?", "YTA. \n\nOne, you don't have custody of your kids. They are adults living at home. No one has custody of them at this point. If they are at risk they can get a hotel. Two, two of you work with kids. You are more of a risk to him and his children than they are to you and your children. And you don't have a weakened immune system from being exposed all the time. I work in education. I have been exposed to all sorts of things. I don't catch much anymore because I have been exposed. And three, if your kids have such weak immune systems why does one work with kids? Or is it just HIS kids that are the bringers of the plague? All other kids are fine though. \n\nLook, he doesn't get to not parent if a child is sick unless he and his ex AGREE that the kids will stay with her on his parenting time.

Just because you are happy with your ex being a fair-weather parent, doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us are. You are trapped in the 1950s. BOTH parents love and care for their children today.

Sharing illness is an unfortunate part of family life.", "YTA - surely you don't want to keep this man who wanted custody of his kids and already doesn't see them often to see them even less, right?... I think that's a really selfish way to put it, and maybe they're calling for the \"mama\" because \"mama\" is the person who's with them all the time. Do you not think that the fact that they're calling for her might hurt your husband? that he also wants to play a role in their life and taking care of them? \n\nI understand your concerns about your daughters, but your request is extremely rude and you're not thinking of your husband at all. Accidents happen and surely the kids didn't want to get covid either. I think it's especially dickish if you had this behaviour pre-covid.

Risking the health of others who may not be able to fight infection easily is a selfish and dangerous move. In fact, I got married during the pandemic and everyone took covid tests to ensure I would be safe (all 150 guests) so the least your husband can do is change his weekend with his son.", "Yta. He\u2019s a parent all year round, whether his child is sick or not.

You as a parent yourself should know that.

It doesnt exactly sound like his EX likes to share her share of the custody.", "NTA it isn't unreasonable to not want a sick person in your house, regardless of who they are. I'm a single mom who definitely looks forward to alone time when I drop off my kids but if a child is sick, then they stay home. That means no birthday parties, sleepovers with cousins, trips to the park or scheduled time with dad. On the other hand, if they are at your house when they get sick it would make sense for them to stay there and not go back to mom's house to infect her too.", "YTA\n\nSo are you also willing to send your kids away if they're sick?

FFS you work with children so you're bringing things home all the time, too, but nobody demands you go stay in a hotel or something.\n\nAnd what's this nonsense about how kids only want their mom when they're sick?  What kind of sexist nonsense are you raising your kids with?  I bet they cry for Daddy when they're sick at Mom's place, too.  Sick kids just want their *parents.*\n\nLook, Mom was good with us when we were sick, but really Dad was the superstar for *knowing what to do* when we were sick.  He wasn't a damned babysitter.

We both have kids from previous marriges. My relationship with my ex is good, his is not with his ex-wife. I have custody of my children, he doesn\u2019t (although he fought for it in the divorce) he has them every second weekends. \n\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t want him to bring his kid if they sick to us , even if it\u2019s his weekend. This has been a source of confilct ever since we married, but it is getting more tense ever since covid. His son had an ugly cough and a slight fever when he took him from his mother. I had an argument about it back then, but he said that it\u2019s okay and they did a test and it was negative. Well it wasn\u2019t. A day later his son\u2019s test was positive and then my husband, me, my two daughers and my ex-husband got sick. It was clear that his son was the source because we were very careful and didn\u2019t go out at all (we infected each other, but the son was the source). That was the end of my leniency. My daughters and ex were high risk and although fortunatelly we are fine, I didn\u2019t want to take that risk ever again. He agreed back then that he shouldn\u2019t have brought his son, and I thought the subject was settled. \n\nBut today he brought his son again with a vomiting-diarrhea kind of illness. I was very angry at him, and told him to call his ex and bring his son back to his mother tomorrow. He is argueing with me, and says that he won\u2019t, because it\u2019s his weekend. \n\nI tell him everytime my reasons: \n1. His ex lives alone, we live with my 2 daughters, so there are more people to get infected, and if one space is already infected why infect and other? \n2. A child always wants to be with their mama when they are sick (he is literally asking for her right now), and a mother will know better what to do (I never gave my sick kids to my ex)\n3. His ex is SAHM, but me and him work, and both of my daughters are university studens and have side-jobs, so will be more affected/miss more by getting sick. (For example I can\u2019t have leave, only sick-leave, which means a lower paycheck.)\n4. Me and my younger daughter works with kids, which mean we have a very week immune system, because we are always surrounded viruses that comes with children, I don\u2019t want be afraid of getting sick in my home.\nHe always dismisses me and says that he has to take his kids, because it\u2019s his weekend sick or not, and that he doesn\u2019t want conflict with his ex. \n\nSo am i wrong here to ask him to not bring the kids? I want to highlight that I don\u2019t want to shorten their time together. I always support that he spend time with his kids, and I would be okay with making up for the missed time by an other weekend, when they healed. \nEnglish is not my first language.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Packing up personal belongings, taking a journey (not sure how long the distance) and unpacking at the other end, then doing it again to go back to Mom's, doesn't sound like a rest and recovery process.

The kids live 11 out of 14 days with their mom, only 3 of those with their dad. \nIf they get sick on the dad's weekend and both dad and ex wife are agreeing to adhere to the custody agreement nonetheless, their mother is essentially kicking them out to their dad. \n\n>And what's this nonsense about how kids only want their mom when they're sick? What kind of sexist nonsense are you raising your kids with?\n\nI'm not sure OPs trying to be sexist. She said that the child is asking for their mother in the next sentence. Stating that they ask for their dad if they're sick at their moms is you making assumptions based on nothing but your personal history. My dad couldn't care for me when I was healthy, much less when I was sick. I most certainly never asked for my dad when I was sick. \n\nIt seems like neither dad nor mom are making sensible changes to the custody agreement based on the actual situation. An agreement is all nice and good as long as nothin out of the ordinary happens, but a kid starting to shit and vomit may should be a thing that makes them pause and rethink if they could schedule their agreement around another weekend. \n\nIn my eyes, TA's are the bio parents who try to force their schedule on the kids albeit them falling sick like kids do.

Working with kids doesn't put anyone at risk, because risk depends on individual immune systems and overrall health. Being around kids might increase the chances of picking up various bugs anf viruses due to them being in a larger group and also having poorer hygiene standards than many adults, but there is a difference between a few days of discomfort whilst sick, followed by feeling 100% fine afterwards... and being immunocompromised to the point that sickness could lead to hospitalisation.", "Grow up lmao basic colds still exist.

No doubt he picks up on how much he is not welcome in their home.", "you americans probably see home differently. for me, a place where I am every second weekend is not home. there lies also the difference between these daughters of OP and the son. this sick kid is being taken from his home to his father's home, because the father *wants* to realise his ambitions as a parent. how is this in the best interest of the son? would you have wanted that as a child?", "as a mother should. a grown child's health is not worth less than a minor's. \n\nalso really it is somewhat fascinating to observe, not only in this thread but on other AITA-s how some people accommodate their new partners' children, while basically trampling over their own children.", "It\u2019s both. It\u2019s implying women are the \u201cnatural care givers\u201d which is both misogyny and misandry.", "It\u2019s a patriarchal standard, it\u2019s misogyny. Misandry is saying women are better than men, misogyny is saying men shouldn\u2019t be doing \u2018women\u2019s roles\u2019.", "I know it's hard to believe but we have support groups for chronically ill people. Most of them were abused. You can Google there is studies of how abuse leads to chronic problems. Trauma plays a huge part in health. Rather you believe that or not.", "but its not about socializing\u2026its about a kid getting his (very limited!) scheduled time with his dad. very poor comparison, honestly.", "I'm not saying that's generally what people do, but staying put is the public health recommendation regardless.", "The kids may not want to be screwed out of the *4* whole nights a month they get to spend with their dad.", "the responsibility owed to minor children is very different than the responsibility owed to adult children. the minor child cannot be responsible for himself. its up to his parents to take care of him and protect him. her adult children are choosing to continue to live with her and her husband, and she wants that choice to affect the life of the actual child in the situation. unacceptable imo.", "I agree it could be seen as both", "My point is not about trauma and it's long term consequences. My point is regarding kids who get childhood illnesses ranging from flu to rotavirus as part of normal childhood exposure.", "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "yes, I can agree to the part of the adult children choosing to live there, but until they move out it is still their primary or only home (if I didn't miss some info). also OP's health imo is just as valuable as the kid's - meaning it should not be expected of her to accept this. her mistake was unfortunately not considering this enough before marrying into this situation, thereby... giving the impression of accepting."]}
