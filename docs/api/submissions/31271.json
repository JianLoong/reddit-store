People are free to have child free weddings.  People are also free to not go to child free weddings.  I would absolutely recommend backing out as MOH now. You won't be fully focused on the wedding,  and from your friend's reaction to your husband not coming,  I'd say that won't go over well.  Tell her that you have realized you will be unable to fulfill those duties and ask if she would rather you attend as a guest without your husband or of they prefer neither of you attend. Remember you are setting a boundary,  not negotiating; if she says it's not okay for just you to attend, she's choosing for neither of you to be there.", "NTA", "NTA.

Nobody overshadows a bride at their own wedding. People who try to just embarrass themselves. A newborn certainly doesn't try to, and I'd be concerned about why your friend would even think so!

I think 3 months is way too early for a sitter overnight.", "NTA.  You already have her, and she agreed, advanced notice that your position as MOH may change depending on the pregnancy. Now that possibility is a reality. Having your husband be with the baby at the hotel was ideal under the circumstances, but if that\u2019s not possible, then opting out may be the only option.

It may mean an extra hotel room, but if they are willing, it is someone whom you would trust to be with your child.", "Nta. I totally get it.  During pregnancy you have no way to know how your baby will be, if you can breadtfeed etc. And also: you won't know how you guys will feel after sleepless nights, birth recovery, etc. She needs to understand this and you were perfectly clear before hand.\n\nFor some perspective: We left our 4 month old with my parents for a day when our best friends married. But: we were 40 minutes away from them, he wasn't breastfed and my parents had babysat before since the little booger was a terrible sleeper so sometimes my parents did the night shift so we could have some sleep.\n\nMost importantly: bride and groom were very understanding if we or one of us didn't make it. We weren't part of the bridal party so didn't have any duties and we left at 12 and were back at 20.30. He had fun with the grandparents and we enjoyed the wedding.

That's a very reasonable compromise for families with kids to have one adult miss to be home with them. Her response of \"no I want you BOTH here for us\" is just her being stubborn and she's forcing your hand in having to bow out by insisting on it being all or nothing. People place waaaay too much emphasis on the single day and their party instead of the relationships and lives before, during, and after that day.

You're picking the right option for you both by bowing out. She's fine to be upset by losing having you there (would be so insulting if she was like 'Yay! jog on, no loss!').

I would suggest you tell her sooner than later that you can not be the MOH.", "NTA you warned her beforehand and she clearly assumed that you would ditch the little dependent being who won't even be weaned yet so that you can help her be the centre of attention.

She was never disrespectful of the brides rules about a child free wedding. She even came up with a solution so she could attend. The bride shot that down. The question is should she stay committed to being the MOH when there is a good chance she may not attend the wedding. She may not be able find a sitter. She may not have recovered here health after the birth of the child. She may not feel comfortable leaving her child with a sitter at 3 months even if she did manage to find one now. It would be far more fair to withdraw from the wedding party now and maybe if things go well she can go simply as a guest.", "Right. If course it comes down to each family's wants and abilities, but if you can feed the kid and have the support network, there is no shame in a parent taking a few days away if they can swing it.", "Exactly. What an ah the bride is", "You go through literally the biggest, quickest, hormone drop of your life when you give birth. Now when my baby was 3 months sure I trusted my husband but I didn\u2019t have as rough of a time postpartum as I\u2019ve seen other people have. \n\nYou say you understand brains change but I don\u2019t think you understand quite how much and what it does to your brain. It\u2019s not 100% about trust, it\u2019s about hormones and brain chemistry.", "It's not just about the parents' feelings or trust, it's also about the baby. If the baby has a very strong attachment to one parent (or both) it's really distressing for them to suddenly not see them for a day or more. At three months I think that would be a problem for most babies.", "Life and people are not as simple as that. It's very naiv to try to make those kind of generalisations. Maybe there things are true for you, but there are a billion potential reasons for why it's not for someone else.", "My baby struggled and became extra clingy while I was in the emergency room overnight around that age. That was an emergency where I needed to go in. A wedding can skip off on it's merry way without me if put in the position OP is in.", "Yeah I trust my partner 100% and have been away from our 9 month old for a night when he was 6 months old. I chose not to breastfeed, partially because it would give us more flexibility like that. If you don't trust your kid's other parent, that is a whole other situation. It's not normal to have such severe anxiety about your child that you can't leave them with a capable, loving, sensible caretaker for a few hours or a night. That's one of the PPs at that point (PPD, PPA, or PPP)", "No, I trust my husband 100% and he's an amazing dad, but I just got controlling when it came to our daughter. I wanted to be the one to fix everything and wanted to micromanage. It was probably a symptom of hormones. I forced myself to let him take over but it wasn't easy. It's not necessarily about lack of trust.", "Small babies usually have 1 primary caretaker. Their absence will cause the babys cortisol levels rising, and staying elevated for quite some time (depending on the time spent apart)", "And honestly, it has nothing to do with the baby. OP will be breastfeeding. That means she will have to either stop and feed a child or stop and pump throughout the day. This will \u201ctake attention away\u201d from the bride (not really) so I can imagine even if OP attended alone she will complain about her the whole day.  There\u2019s really no way for her to be a bridesmaid, especially with the bride not understanding and accepting that.", "Yeah, she's being ridiculous, so just ignore her texts and bow out. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I have. Cause I worked for a year in a children hospital ward. And now i work in a nursery. I studied 3 years to work in those fields and with kids.\n\nWhat exactly does qualify you as a good parent except that you let smbdy fuck you?", "Now you\u2019re playing make believe. \n\nYou need to reread the post AND my response. You\u2019re acting like I told her she\u2019s wrong and you\u2019re coming off a bit too invested in these other peoples lives. \n\nNo, I don\u2019t think she should drop out before trying to make it work. \n\nYes I believe she should stay committed to something she WANTS to be a part of until she has exhausted every option. \n\nNo, you\u2019re not making any sense. \n\nAnd yes, I\u2019d prefer you to speak with someone else about your views on this because you are either not reading or not comprehending. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna pour more time into this conversation when you never correctly read the first statement I made. \ud83d\ude02 good bye", "I\u2019m not a parent. I\u2019m just also not going to insist that parents bow to the insane whims of a bride. They don\u2019t have to try leaving their baby with a sitter if they don\u2019t want to. The dad was going to stay home so Princess could have her special day, and that still wasn\u2019t good enough. They don\u2019t have to do anything else to appease this woman, and it doesn\u2019t matter if other people would.", "What do you mean try to make it work? She doesn\u2019t have family in the area where the wedding is taking place, probably doesn\u2019t want to use a babysitter she\u2019s never met for her 3 month old, and doesn\u2019t want to leave her baby at home to travel for the wedding. What other option is there? The options are already exhausted at this point.", "I think they would change their mind as soon as the kid would be there", "Think hard on this one\u2026 \n\nWhat did I say to do if she couldn\u2019t make it work?\n\nPart of y\u2019all\u2019s problem is your refusal to think for yourselves. Instead your on Reddit asking stupid questions when you took an extra 20 seconds to think before speaking, you\u2019d have your solution. \n\nThink at least two moves ahead before you make another response to me. Think \u201cwill my response give this person another chance to make a witty joke at my expense do to my lack of consideration?\u201d", "You think they\u2019d have a baby and immediately decide \u201cyes me and my husband will both travel 4.5 hours away for a long day without this baby so a lunatic can have her fantasy that we\u2019re all only thinking about how beautiful she is\u201d. That\u2019s what you think?", "@ Thistime232 \u2019m not beating my chest brother. You\u2019re just beating yourself up and expecting me not to react to it. \n\nI\u2019m genuinely surprised that so many of you on here are as soft and malleable as you are considering this type of post is EXACTLY for conversation and debate. \n\nBut instead of holding yourselves to standards that would make you look respectable, you demand ME to ignore the fallacies of your statements and ignorance / willful misinterpretations of other peoples statements. \n\nStay out of the kitchen if you can\u2019t take the heat.
