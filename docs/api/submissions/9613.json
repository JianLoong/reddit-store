Also, back in the day we were never even asked to buy our own school supplies in grammar school.

Cc a VP, summarizing the teacher's demand and why it will not be met for a very rational reason. In fact OP really has no reason to even leave any room for debate. It's on the school to give a reasonable justification why this parent must pay when their child has medical issues that bar them from participating and OP made other arrangements.\n\n(NTA)", "Doesn't sound like that's the parents problem.", "I\u2019m from the uk and here some supermarkets do all the ingredients for a meal for a family of 4 including a desert for \u00a35 so for some who are really struggling that is literally a families meal they are paying the school just for maybe 1 slice of pizza that your kid probably won\u2019t im eat all of anyway!", "This is actually a huge problem even without the medical stuff. Excluding poor kids because their parents don't have $5 is fucked up. My school always sent out letters to have parents pay but we always made sure every kid got to go even if they didn't have the money, as long as the permission slip was returned signed. The money the parents send in is to replenish the account actually. We were required to show we could pay for every kid when we applied for the event or trip.", "It\u2019s likely she would end up paying for it herself. I\u2019m a teaching assistant and we always seem to end up with one or two parents not contributing to something, and we just end up putting the money in ourselves rather than have the child feel excluded (assuming the parent hasn\u2019t requested they not take part).", "My senior year felt like they were trying to squeeze as much money as possible from students. Cap and gown, class photos, year book, senior trip, prom, class rings and so much more. I didn't get to do any of it because my family couldn't afford it. Luckily I was a bit of a contrarian, so I didn't want to walk anyway. My picture also wasn't included in the year book because they took them before school started, and we couldn't afford gas to drive that far just for a picture my parents weren't going to buy. So even if I were able to afford a year book, I wouldn't have been in it. It's insane the amount of money they try to get from parents.", "That hasn't been true in a long time, but public perception hasn't caught up to reality. Teachers make a solidly middle class living in all but the most expensive cities. \nMedian pay is around $60k/year, for 9 months, plus more if they teach summer school, run after school activities, or take on added administrative duties. Most union contracts also give them bumps if they get extra credentials.\n\nCompare that to the median individual income of $44k/year. Teachers are doing well, but the big teachers unions do their best to keep the perception that teachers are underpaid active.\n\nEdit: median teacher pay instead of average", "Then don't have a pizza party? Or budget ahead of time knowing some kids might not pay", "When I was in high school, I had to convince the teacher for our club to order from pizza hut at the time when they had $5 medium pizzas and it was still comparable to little Caesars because I didn't like little Caesars as a teenager but yeah, the teacher is probably getting the cheap pizza and a bunch of two litters which should not equal $100 to feed a class of 20 kids.", "okay??? i was just explaining", "How much could a banana be, Michael?", ">Are you from the 80s or something?\n\nWTH? Yes. LOL  \nRegular price, four bucks, four bucks!  \nI think that was the 90s though.", "What is your problem with my comment?", "unnecessary considering you aren\u2019t even who i was replying to", "My middle school had Dominos in the cafeteria one day a week  ... not my favorite even for big chain pizza but still like it better than ordinary school cafeteria food", "See also, nursing", "My kids' high school had us pay for the RENTAL  of the graduation gown, and then you just keep the cap and tassel. For the life of me I can't remember how much it was, even though it was just last year. I had two seniors, so it certainly wasn't cheap. Then the company that rents the gowns sends a flier with the order form with all kinds of optional swag, that of course the kids are going to want - - really pricey invitations, fancier tassels, class year sweatshirts and tee shirts, all kinds of stuff. I had to tell them we couldn't afford it and just got what was required. (They were fine with that, though.)", "The fact that a lot of people are underpaid doesn\u2019t mean some other people aren\u2019t also underpaid- especially when one considers how much many teachers are expected to do out of pocket.\n\nAlso, notable that you use average for the one you want to seem high but median for the one you wanted to seem lower. I prefer median for income but definitely pick one or the other.", "NTA because it\u2019s tough out there and everyone has to make the best decisions for their families - but it may be that the teacher is saying that it\u2019s not optional because there is no way that she could stop a child from eating pizza even if that particular kid didn\u2019t contribute towards the pizza\u2026. The teacher can\u2019t very well say - \u201chey you!  You can\u2019t have pizza because your parents didn\u2019t pay for you!\u201d  That would be worse\u2026", "NTA Her saying \"it's not optional\" had as much weight as me demanding $5 from you. It is absolutely optional and it's disgraceful of her to pretend otherwise. \n\nPlease go over her head. She may be bullying people who really cannot afford this and other people whose children cannot eat the meal.", "How the tables have turned, they wouldn't like that I'm sure man.", "Yes, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s totally fair to expect a parent to pay to have their kid feel excluded. /s\n\nFuck right off with this nonsense.", "I agree with you. I have no doubt that OP\u2019s daughter won\u2019t want the pizza but I\u2019m not sure how the teacher is supposed to police who eats the pizza and who doesn\u2019t. With that being said, with the cost of living being what it is right now, $5 is a big deal to a lot of families right now. The teacher should not be threatening OP.", "That's a little extreme. The whole class shouldn't get a pizza party because a kid can't eat pizza? She's fine sending her kid to school with a pre-packed lunch she can eat... it's the mandatory having to pay for something she's not doing that's the issue. Not the party itself nor should it be. I couldn't participate in them either as a kid because of restrictions but I would never want to be the reason other kids couldn't. That's ridiculous. Some people need to put down their pitchforks and chill out.", "What the\u2026good grief! I could see taking a deposit to cover the school\u2019s ass if a kid sets it on fire, but a rental fee is nuts. I feel you on the extra stuff though. I lost count of the number of ways my high school tried to get our money. I got a yearbook, a fancy tassel because I really liked it, and like one t shirt. Plus a few t shirts for school clubs I was actually actively involved in.", "That sounds reasonable! I always got yearbooks. And I did get Class of 2022 shirts, I just got them from somewhere else, better priced. And if there was an activity shirt at the time of the activity, like sports or theater, something like that. We were fortunate that we could do that much, although of course many families can't.", "Just saying, I remember our school \u201cpizza parties\u201d and it consisted of a half of a piece of pizza without soda lol", "Sounds a lot like your teacher is failing to include your child and consider their documented inability to eat pizza. NTA, you should be furious", "NTA.\n\nTell her it's an option and ask her what she plans to do about it.", "NTA - i remember a lot of programs like this and they were never \"mandatory\". Tell her no, and if she continues to press or holds it against daughter you'll take the emails to admin and actually push the issue.", "NTA when I was a kid five dollars would easily break my Moms wallet sometimes, to make it mandatory when your kid can't even participate? Absolute not.", "NTA alot of times the $$ doesn't just go towards pizza, but soda, cups, napkins etc, but if your kid isn't participating then neither does your money imho. I've been there, some of the school requests can cut into your budget. This sort of thing is always weird, because parents can opt out and teachers can be left to pick up the slack. I think i'd prefer set a goal of X dollars and if the kids can get money from the parents, then it happens.", "Yep, I feel that it will be a better thing to do. I'd do that too man.", "That's how it should be, you shouldn't be forced to pay for it man.", "Atleast they asked that why you guys wouldn't pay, these people don't even do that much.\n\nThat just goes to show you how ignorant they actually are.", "Those kind of teachers should be complained against man.", "Yep, she doesn't get to tell you that. She doesn't have the right.", "It sounds that the teacher is trying to scam, that's how it is.", "Yeah it's okay to send any really, that's totally fine with me.", "But kids atleast should have a choice, shouldn't be mandatory at all.", "Yep, that works out for you. that sounds about right to me man.", "There could be many reasons for why someone wouldn't want to pay.", "I don't think that you did anything wrong, these issues are real actually.", "Yeah why would you pay for anything like that? I definitely wouldn't man.", "Well it's kind of fucked up that it's mandatory to pay it man.", "Yeah it's not option at all, they're going to rob your house for it man.", "Yeah it's completely not good to ask for the money from the people.", "I hope that they can't do that, because that sounds fucked up.", "Yeah what's she gonna do? There's nothing to do anyways so yeah.", "Exactly, you don't have to do it. You should have a choice there really.", "I hope that it's an option, because it'll way better that way honestly.", "Yeah it's not gonna be that, she could that in my opinion so yeah.", "I never had that kind of arguments and I'm never going to really.", "Yep, that's what they're looking for the most of the time actually.", "\"I'm sorry, your parent didn't pay so you can't have pizza\"\n\n\"I didn't want your shitty pizza anyway\"\n\n*surprised pikachu face*", "Exactly, people should have a choice for that. That would make sense.", "I wonder what they're spending all that money on. Can't only be pizzas."]}
