Also, back in the day we were never even asked to buy our own school supplies in grammar school.

Tell that teacher paying $5 is optional, just like it\u2019s pretty God damn optional you will go over head and escalate this if she insists one more time.", "Nta for ANY reason but i need to point out that at $5 per kid this teacher is actually making a profit on the pizza!!!", "Every single thing you are asked to pay for at school is optional except taxes. As a retired principal, this burns me. Simply do not respond and do not send money. What is she going to do?

Is this a worthy battle? In this situation I'd be fine with a donation to a class treat. My concern would finding finding a treat for your child for that day.", "NTA.  Not an option?  What is she going to do about it? Why should you be on the hook for paying for pizza your child can't even eat?  I would say to boot this problem up the school food chain but I wouldn't even bother.  I just wouldn't hand over the money.", "NTA - what the hell? Many kids have allergies or can\u2019t eat pizza. It\u2019s always been optional at our son\u2019s school.

That teacher has balls! Telling you not sending money isnt an option.. your kid wont participate so you are not obligated to pay. I would contact the principal as well. Some families can't afford an extra 5$. What would she do then?", "NTA\n\nPersonally I would\u2019ve just coughed up the cash but I don\u2019t like the teachers response. Where in your tuition statement does it allocate $5 for pizza? If your kid goes to a public school it\u2019s even more ridiculous.", "Especially since it\u2019s medical no just picky", "Exactly.  I'm sure the principal would want to know that one of their teachers is trying to shake parents down for pizza party money.\n\nNTA", "That\u2019s a great idea. She should definitely go to higher ups maybe something above the principal that works with her every day.", "As a former teacher it\u2019s really unethical to do that. You can\u2019t require money from people in a public school setting, it\u2019s illegal and they can get in trouble for sure.

There are 25 kids in the class, so each kid pays a *share* of $5.\n\nIt's only slightly different, but it is different. The teacher probably should have asked the class how many would participate and adjust the order and the price per share to accommodate only those participating.", "Hopefully the teacher would do nothing, but it's possible they could punish the child by singling them out and/or making them leave the classroom during the pizza party due to their parents not paying. I wouldn't *expect* a teacher to do this these days, but I could see it happening.", "The teacher will be short $5  and it will be on teacher to pay more.

I could totally see other parents being intimidated into paying even if their kids don't want to eat too or they can't afford it. Yeah, 5 bucks is not a lot, but right now so many are struggling and it can add up, especially if this teacher throws a lot of parties or the parents have multiple kids", "I\u2019m curious\u2026are their consequences if someone doesn\u2019t pay this non-optional payment? I would hit the teacher back and tel her if she wanted this pizza party then she should\u2019ve been prepared to have the money in her own pocket to be used.

Her daughter won\u2019t be forced to eat pizza & Mom won\u2019t be forced to pay $5. Kid will go to school & have fun with her classmates at the class party. The reason paying for special classroom activities is not optional is because a lot of parents would just never pay then. Discrimination.... C\u2019mon. What happens for the parents who paid but their kids just don\u2019t like pizza? Is that also discrimination?", "Agreed! When I was in high school, I couldn't afford to pay the \"class dues\" that we had. The class adviser teacher actually tried telling me I wouldn't be allowed to walk at my graduation if I didn't pay them the $45 bucks or whatever it was. I, (being the tv legal drama expert I thought myself at that point,) very plainly asked who I should direct my lawyer to contact since it was pretty clearly extortion being that it was a PUBLIC high school. She paled and then said she'd mark me as all set.\n\nIt's such crap when they make stuff like that seem mandatory, especially for lower-income families.", "I mean, I highly doubt it is that specific. Especially since it comes out to a nice even 5 dollars instead of like $4.27. Also, pizzas do not divide evenly by 25. The teacher will know how many kids paid in time before she orders so can adjust accordingly", "Yeah. It sounds more like the teacher didn\u2019t think things through and is now stubbornly digging her heels in. She\u2019s still the ah, for sure though.", "Why can't they just order less pizza as there'll be fewer people eating it?!", "I can sympathize with the books, paper, and other school supplies.  I'm not going to sympathize for a pizza party that OPs kid can't enjoy.", "Then don't buy pizza. There are parents worse off than teachers.", "Teachers aren\u2019t the only ones struggling - OP states the $5 will also be a hardship for them. I don\u2019t know why their hardship matters less than the teacher\u2019s.", "You can get a whole pizza for $5. $7-10 is easy too. There will be plenty of money if all the kids who are actually participating. They don't need the money from the kid who's being left out.", "It may depend on the school. I was able to apply for funding to attend a band trip to NYC my senior year of high school. I was in a nice middle/upper middle class high school so most students easily covered their own costs. The band program was didn't mention it to everyone, but there was support available for kids like me who couldn't afford to attend. I was working part time and paid in around $200, but there was no way I could have afforded the trip without it. In my case, our band directors were very aware of my home situation and told me that scholarships were available so I didn't have to try to raise the money needed myself.", "We always had fundraisers to help pay for things like band & choir trips. We'd sell pizzas, cookie dough, or candy, as well as put on concerts & sell tickets. I didn't do too bad with selling pizzas & candy, because my dad worked for a construction supply company & the guy who worked there, always bought a couple hundred dollars worth of stuff. I hated having to sell the tickets though. I'd hit up every family member I could, because  everyone in choir lived in my neighborhood!! It was hard to do fundraisers in a small town!", "It depends a ton on where you are, your school, the specific program... There was an out of state trip to perform at an amusement park when I was in band. My family couldn't afford it. Everyone in band was supposed to sell candy to subsidize the cost of the trip and overall make it cheaper, but even the best possible cheaper price, my family wouldn't be able to afford. The candy selling *was* the financial support. And we didn't have anyone we could sell the candy to, anyway. My dad's workplace had strict policies against that sort of thing.", "Right, or if they have Little Caesars in the area, they can get a whole 1-topping pizza for $5. That pricing may be regional, but at least in the Atlanta area, they're still $5.

That could impact the amount of food needed.\n\nPlus tax, the delivery charge, the tip, and the sodas?\n\n$10 for a pizza divided by 3 is $3.33, plus $1 per kid for soda (and that's pouring into cups, since a single soda is $1.99). That's $4.33 per kid. Add sales tax (5% because I don't know where OP lives) adds 22 cents. So that's $4.55. A 10% tip adds 45 cents and we are at $5 without even adding in the delivery fee or paper goods.", "I can agree with what you said its just that from my experiance when we had a pizza party we had bean bag games and things like that", "Also if there\u2019s 22 kids in the class then what is she spending $110 on? Can\u2019t all be pizza and drinks.", "It\u2019s a teacher so broke isn\u2019t unlikely and also this is a hell of a jump from the teacher being blockheaded and a little dense on something to actively embezzling pizza party money.", "If their kids don't like pizza and aren't going to eat it  they shouldn't pay either.", "Cmon we both know throwing that word is just to get the principals attention, plus if they always only have pizza parties that is literally discrimination against lactose intolerant kids.  It\u2019s not that hard to find a different food.", "Had to BUY my graduation cap and gown for high school. HAD TO. It was like $75, which was definitely more than some people had. I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t just loan out gowns, especially considering graduation was before the school year actually ended. So pointless. I couldn\u2019t even tell you where that crap is now, the tassel is the only thing I actively kept.", "Adjust the order form 7 pizzas to 6\u00bd?

My kid\u2019s class has 24 students, x $5 each is enough for TWENTY of the cheapest pizzas near us", "How much do crafts and decorations a cost? What if it\u2019s from someplace a bit more expensive than Walmart (since the teacher is using their OWN time to get items and shouldn\u2019t be expected to drive everywhere)? \n\nShould the kid just be moved into a different classes room, which isn\u2019t having any sort of party, during this time?  Should the party just be cancelled?

So a little more than 1 slice per kid.", "Sure. No one do anything they don\u2019t want to do & life will be fine.", "In my experience, I\u2019m guessing this is a classroom reward for an achievement the class had & all the kids vote on what they want to do.

It\u2019s a party. \n\nIf my kid was invited to a birthday party & they were having pizza I would send them with some food, a gift for the birthday kid & tell them to have a great day!

They\u2019re not buying gourmet pizzas for an elementary class. So 4 pizzas plus $20 on drinks. Schools around here don\u2019t allow deliveries so class parent would have to pick it up and bring it so no delivery tip.", "I agree with everything you\u2019re saying but this being a classroom party is very different than an out of school birthday party.", "So logically the teacher should ask for less money right?

This is why there is a shortage of teachers.\n\nNobody is offended or upset about that. \n\nThey are upset because this teacher a) tried to strongarm a parent into paying for something that is very much optional and b) there is absolutely no reason you should pay for something your kid cannot/won't participate in.", "Where did you get the \"drinks, snacks, maybe games\" from? The OP only mentioned pizza. \n\nIf there were other parts that the daughter could actually partake in, there probably wouldn't be an issue.\n\nAnd teachers need to make plans within their means.

Or maybe next time to avoid this problem she should call every parent & order individual meals for each student & they can pay accordingly. Parties cost money. That\u2019s just a fact. If $5 is too much to pay, don\u2019t send in your money because there will always be parents who send in more to ensure every kid gets to participate. No one has an issue with parents who can\u2019t afford to pay. There\u2019s no harm, no foul on that. But don\u2019t make a federal case out it. It ruins it for all the kids.", "There\u2019s a difference between being offended and wanting your child to be able to eat during their school parties.  Especially when it keeps happening."]}
