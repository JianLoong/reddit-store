You don't need to call and directly report her since this isn't a big issue. Just call in and ask to speak to the vp or the principal and ask if the school has any policy like this. It won't.

Classroom parties, such as pizza parties, are special events meant to celebrate some type of classroom goal (such as each student reaching 10 books per month) or to mark a special occasion (like the last day of school for the year). Parties like these are primarily funded by the teacher. However, parents are often asked to contribute a small monetary amount to offset the total cost the teacher has to pay out of their own pocket.
