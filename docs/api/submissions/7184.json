My family for reference are the type to talk a lot and talk over each other. However I have always been dubbed the quiet one. I have a hard time sticking up for myself but I try to advocate for my son, though I feel normally my words are lost on them. \nFor context my husband and I are trying to teach our son about body boundaries and consent. Recently my older sister came over and while she was holding my son while sitting in a chair he started whining to get down. She didn\u2019t seem to be listening to I told her \u201chey he wants to get down\u201d she told me to relax it\u2019s fine but he kept whining and started saying \u201cI\u2019m stuck\u201d over and over again so I told my sister \u201cno he wants to get down let him down\u201d. I said it firmly though she believes I screamed at her. After that night I decided enough was enough (because this wasn\u2019t the first time I have not been listened to by a family member)and I wrote a letter to my whole immediate family (not naming names) regarding boundaries for our kids. I will not put the whole letter but it entailed the following:\n\nBody boundaries and consent- just because our children are small does not mean they owe you anything. Not a hug, kiss, anything. These things are of course great, however, children should be asked for hugs etc (via open arms or verbal) if they refuse the only response should be okay no problem(even if they seem like they are joking) They should not be made to feel guilty for their decisions about their own body. Also if a hug or cuddle is given and then the child seems done or uncomfortable you let go, you do not hold them there. This is how we teach boundaries and consent. This is also how we teach our children to advocate for their own bodies. Same will be told to my children about touching other people\u2019s bodies. \n\nWe ask that you don\u2019t;\n\nDon\u2019t mock our kids crying by fake crying at them or telling them to stop crying. WE try to ask are you okay rather than saying you\u2019re okay.\n\nDon\u2019t ask our kids to keep secrets.\n\nWe would prefer you not argue with us parenting our own kids including passive aggressive comments while we are parenting/disciplining.\n\nDon\u2019t threaten to spank or punish our kids.\n\nAnyway, it was not well received but after talking with my mom and brother in law (husband brother) they understood and respected our wishes. I can understand that writing a letter might not have been the way to go. My sister on the other hand threw insults at me and we didn\u2019t speak for a week. I did reach out to her via phone call and we spoke and got absolutely nowhere. She does not seem to understand that I just want people to listen when my toddler says no to someone touching his body it means no. I am not trying to take affection away from everybody, they are free to hug him if they want to and he wants to. It just boggles my mind why she can\u2019t understand this.

Because literally every one of your \"boundaries\" or \"rules\" comes down to one thing: \n\nYou're asking people to treat your kids like small HUMAN BEINGS, deserving of nothing more or less than the basic dignity and thoughtfulness that any person should have a right to. \n\nYou're not being demanding or outrageous or controlling. You're asking for your kids not to be treated as playthings or pets, or to have their feelings or autonomy dismissed, which is super important because as small humans they are vulnerable in any interaction with adults (as evidenced by your son getting increasingly distressed when he asked to be put down and your sister just flat-out ignored him while holding him . . . she literally was holding him against his will, and thought nothing of it because he was small and she was big, and that's horrifying). The fact that you even have to ask them some of these things, like not to MOCK small children by fake crying at them, is appalling, and suggests that you're dealing with some really messed up adults . . . but that's a whole other discussion. No matter what, you're NTA.", "NTA. Wish my parents did that. I was always disgusted by my one aunt and that resulted that I don\u2019t  like her as much as my other family members.", "NTA. They are in the habit of ignoring you, and it's going to take time to change that. The letter is a good first step, but especially with your sister it's going to take reinforcement. The next time she hangs onto your child and says \"it's fine\" remove your son from her. \n\nExplain again firmly (and so others can hear) that while it might be \"fine\" for her it isn't for your toddler and she's completely ignoring his autonomy and your explicit request.", "NTA. Someone in your family should go and grab your sister and pull her onto their lap and hold on tight\u2026she how she likes it and how suddenly \u201cbody boundaries\u201d will be okay.", "NTA.

Boundaries are important", "NTA - You are the parent and should advocate for your children. What you're teaching them is great and they should be listened to. Many people feel they can't speak for themselves because they are children, but while they may not know the right words, little kids are very clear when they don't like something. Good for you.", "NTA and stand your ground. What you're teaching your kids about bodily autonomy will stand them in good stead in later life.", "NTA One of the things we do as new parents (almost unconsciously) is assess how our relatives interact with our kids to determine who would serve well as emergency caregivers. For many parents, your sister would have just been crossed off that internal list without a discussion. Her response to your letter gives you even more indication to how your wishes might be adhered to if she were watch / care for your children at any point.", "NTA and I think you did great with your letter.

My older son (8) has only had to use it with a (well meaning but obtuse) family member who was terribly embarrassed but sure learned her lesson after that. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re teaching this to your children. If someone doesn\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t need to be allowed access to your family.", "NTA. You're the mother. We owe our children everything. I think it's fantastic that you find your inner bear to stand up for your kids when you never did it for yourself. Your children will appreciate the value you place on their autonomy.  I'm so proud of you.  I know that this means nothing, but as a child that was never taught autonomy I appreciate you.", "NTA - I think it is so important that kids are taught about their bodies and setting boundaries. That being said for a lot of people this is a relatively new thing that probably no one would have considered before now. Potentially this is why some of them are finding it tough to adjust their thinking so I would say be patient too. \n\nYour family don\u2019t have to share your views but the absolutely have to respect and honour your wishes for your child.", "NTA and I\u2019m glad you spoke up for your son, teaching bodily autonomy is very important. I\u2019m sorry your family reacted badly, but that\u2019s on them, not you. \nI don\u2019t know if writing a letter was the \u201cwrong\u201d thing, and doing it another way was better, but good for you.", "NTA Your sister understands it perfectly well, but she just doesn't respect you, or your wishes and is pushing at your boundaries. You might have to take a break from your sister for a while until she comes into line.", "NTA. What you want for your children should be matters of course. That is was even necessary to write a letter tells us that someone is overstepping their boundaries. If things don't improve, the next step is low contact/no contact.", "NTA. You are a great mom! Way to advocate for your child!", "NTA. You have every right to parent your children the way you want, no matter if your family approves or not. Just continue to gently reinforce the boundaries with them each and every time you need to, even if you have to walk over and hold out your arms to take your son from your sister. \u201cIn our family, we let the children down when they ask,\u201d or whatever. You making different choices doesn\u2019t automatically mean that you are criticizing how they are raising their kids, but that you want to do something different.", "NTA", "NTA she does understand,  she just doesn't *care*. She wants to do things tge way *she* wants to.", "You are very much NTA. You are to be commended for standing up for your kid and congratulated on the clear eloquence of your response to family. If your sister in law cannot abide by your rules, well to bad. She can be banned from holding, seeing, whatever the kid. Good luck.", "Absolutely NTA. You get em! And you\u2019re showing your children they can count on your support. That\u2019s a great thing tbh", "NTA. at all. kids, despite being little and not knowing too much of the world yet, are still humans, with emotions. when a child expresses discomfort (in said hugs or being held), they should be respected. \n\nalso, you are a human too, and with emotions as well. when you express discomfort (sending the letter), you should be respected.\n\ni really don\u2019t get how listening and understanding others feelings and wishes is so hard for some people.", "NTA.  I think writing the letter WAS ABSOLUTELY the way to go!  Your sister is obviously going to need to rea the \"rules\" over and over again until they sink in.  Also, this way, everyone will be clear on what was requested of them when, not if, disagreements occur.", "NTA. And you sister has just proven your point. She refuses to listen to your son or to listen to you. I would limit the time you spend around her.", "Ask your sister how she would talk to a man who was larger than her, holding her against her will. Training body boundaries this young will help reinforce and prevent possible SA. It goes along with \"he is only bullying you because he likes you\". It makes no difference that your child is male.\n\nNTA, but your sister is WAYYY out of touch with current thinking. I am so grateful that my granddaughters are being taught this way.", "NTA, your sister does not have to understand and it is not about her feelings. All she has to do is take cues from your kid, does not sound like the end of the world really? I'm actually surprised that you need to teach them that? Anyway, good for you for trying and I hope she will get the message. You are doing good!", "NTA. Honey. Your family is emotionally abusive.", "Oh you made me tear up. When I tried to talk it through with my sister she just kept saying I hurt her feelings. I felt very invalidated by her and started to feel I was wrong in some way.

I don\u2019t remember being taught explicitly about body autonomy growing up either.", "Absolutely I agree.

Now when I walk into my sister's house I ask the 3 year old if I can have a hug and 9 times out of 10 they say no. The 2 year old just shakes their head or comes running to you and throws themselves at you. And that is that. Both of my Niblings are very loving to their families, but because they have been taught to, they also ask if they can give you a hug .

My wife and daughter enjoy tickle fights, while I don't. So we practice this a lot, and when struggling to escape we pause and ask our daughter if she wants us to stop (usually she says no).\n\nThe only time this has been an issue is with my FIL (who doesn't respect ANY boundaries) and one of my wife's cousins last year, who wouldn't stop tickling my daughter when she asked. So my wife \"attacked\" the cousin (oh, the fear in his eyes, despite his protests of \"I'm bigger and stronger now!\").\nPoint being, is important to teach kids this stuff before it becomes a bigger issue.", "Idk because when another family member of ours tries to touch her or hug her without her consent she gets very defensive and talks about how she doesn\u2019t like to be touched because of being SA and how that person should pretty much respect her boundaries.", "nta.  When my husband was a kid, his mothers cousin would toss him up in the air and twirl him around/  He's legally blind and that was torture for him.  He hates that person still and it's been 30 years.

You are totally within your right. Even if they disagree\u2014news flash, not their kids so no one cares if they agree. We have the exact (exact!) same rules with our kids and our families. The ones we don\u2019t think will respect these boundaries, we will go LC with (basically just my grandma, but there\u2019s more to her bull shit than just boundary breaking). Both of our immediate families though agreed. Sometimes it takes them a moment to get used to a rule, but they legitimately try and succeed and they respect our rules.

Did she think about your son's feelings? She's an adult and can process it and learn, let it go or hold a grudge.  As an adult she has choices.  Your son did not.
