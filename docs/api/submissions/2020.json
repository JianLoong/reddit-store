Why didn't your parents or grandparents step up?", "NTA.  You said that the only time your cousin spends time with your family is on Christmas, don't go to that holiday.  OR go early, spend some time with some family, and when your cousin arrives, LEAVE.  State that it's your mother's rule to not start stuff on Christmas, so you must be on your way before things get started.  Look directly at your cousin, and throw in, \"since there's family here that clearly doesn't understand how family is supposed to act and treat one another.\" And leave.  Oh, to be a fly on the wall.\n\nI do not blame you for not wanting to go for Christmas.  I wouldn't either.  Who wants to be around someone who treated you poorly?  Be the bigger person?  You are- you're going to surround yourself around people who don't treat you like crap.  Good for you.    Why would anyone say YTA when you're not comfortable going?  Don't go.  Celebrate with people who both love and respect you.  Your family doesn't, or they would be pissed off for you, for not getting invited in the first place.", "Info: does your mom know that your cousin deliberately left you out?", "Well if she's gone MIA trying to contact her, I surely would be showing up at Christmas and ask WTF her problem is.

If things go south and you have no back up, maybe you can consider to go NC or LC with her and the people who back her up.

No. Would I create some healthy boundaries and communicate them to your most trusted family members? Yes.", "NTA. If I had to make a wild guess... is it possible her bio parents got into her head and lied that they totally would have been there for her all along growing up if you hadn't ruined it all by stealing her away from them? She may really want to believe that, since no one wants to feel abandoned by their birth mom / bio dad. She may not want to hear the truth right now (hence blocking you) if either of them recently stepped back into the picture and started pouring on the charm. \n\nI'd be so curious if I were you that I'd need to get to the bottom of it. If you truly have no idea why she's suddenly estranged herself from you. Before lashing out angrily, I'd try to get her a message that you love her, and if she truly doesn't want you in her life, you'll respect that, but you would love to know if there's anything you did that you can apologize for. Tell her you'll be there to listen if she ever wants to resume the relationship. \n\nDon't get defensive either. Have a friend read it for you first to make sure your tone is okay. Then mail it or get it to her. If she chooses not to respond, then respect that. Sometimes grown ups need to pull away from the people who raised them. It hurts, but you can let it be if that's what she wants or needs. You've already done enough for her.", "NTA. I wouldn't be surprised if someone got to her.

She would text me pictures of the stamped/addressed envelopes, but for the entire duration of their relationship, nothing she sent ever reached me (she ended up texting me all of the details fir whatever event they were having, at the same time the invitation was being mailed - so I know I wasn\u2019t \u2018guilting her into inviting me).", "NTA\nIt is strange that she blocked you.

It sounds like the cousin was throwing intentional digs all last Christmas and I\u2019m sure other family at the party were sure to realize that \u201call\u201d was not the case as OP wasn\u2019t there. \n4. OP has been the bigger person this whole time. So many people from this sub on a variety of different posts would\u2019ve made this a huge deal before or after the wedding and made a scene about it. She\u2019s been extremely kind regarding the situation and if she is uncomfortable around that cousin and the cousin is making passive aggressive digs with no family sticking up for her, why Op have to be around them. \n5. She took her 3 cousins in and raised them. As a young teen and adult she was caring for them that\u2019s insane. If her cousin doesn\u2019t want to be grateful at all it\u2019s not her problem.
