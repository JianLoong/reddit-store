He isn\u2019t all that terrible to me or my brother (17m) but he\u2019s horrible to our mom. \n\nGrowing up, it was very obvious that our dad saw our mom as \u201clesser than.\u201d He\u2019d yell at her over everything and made her responsible for everything. Cleaning, taking care of us, etc. My mom never said anything and tried her hardest to make it seem like everything was okay. \n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit, but I\u2019m too scared to stand up to my dad. I always freeze. My brother, on the other hand, does not give a shit. He yells back and isn\u2019t afraid of anything. \n\nI think my brother realized that I\u2019m too scared to protect our mom and recently told us that he\u2019s going to a college nearby and will be commuting as the college doesn\u2019t require first years to live on campus. \n\nMy parents were confused and my dad was a little upset. He kept telling him that he\u2018s going to miss out and he\u2019ll regret it but my brother didn\u2019t budge. Mom even told him that he should go and that she\u2019ll be fine. But my brother just said that they\u2019re lucky he\u2019s even going to college. \n\nWell yesterday we got a surprise visit from our grandma (dad\u2019s mom). She never visits and when she does, she also just treats my mom like shit so we weren\u2019t very excited. But we were civil because well if we aren\u2019t then she\u2019ll find a way to blame our mom.\n\nIt was okay at first but then she asked my mom: \u201cIs this what you wanted? Are you proud of yourself?\u201c My mom started to shake but my brother immediately got in between them. Grandma just rolled her eyes and asked my brother if he was really going to throw away his life just because he thinks his mom\u2019s too fragile to survive without him. My brother didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nI then spoke up and said \u201cit\u2019s not because of mom. It\u2019s because of you and dad. You guys are horrible and you really need to get the fuck out.\u201d \n\nMy grandma immediately started yelling at me. She said that she expected better and said that I\u2019m rude, disrespectful and bratty. She then told my mom that she raised horrible kids before leaving angrily. \n\nI know I was just standing up for my mom and my brother keeps telling me I\u2019m fine, but I feel guilty. My grandma apparently adores me according to my dad and I really broke her heart. And it\u2019s not like I made things better (maybe even worse). My dad\u2019s expecting me to apologize but idk I don\u2019t want to.

As a person who was too young to do that for my mom, I applaud you for taking a stand.  Always be a person that can stand for others and make things right.

I would wager this is something he\u2019s done countless times to you, your brother, and your mother. \n\nHave you spoken to a trusted adult or therapist about some of the things happening at home? Neither you nor your brother should have to feel like it\u2019s your job to protect your mother.", "NTA, there is nothing wrong with taking up for your mom.  Your grandmother needs to mind her own business.  Your dad isn't doing your mom right, but your grandmother should butt out!", "This is sort of complicated...\n\nI'm going to say NTA, since she did provoke your mom, and in turn, your brother.

Your grandmother and father have no right to treat your mother like this, but it is up to her to do something about it. She should have left your father long ago.

Your grandma adored you because you were quiet, unlike your brother. I think it's good you are standing up for her and yourself.", "You are being gaslit, Grandma doesn't adore anyone she treats like that.  Nothing will get better regardless of what you do.  Protect your mother and your brother is a saint for what he's doing to protect you both.", "NTA. \n\nYou stood up for yourself and your mom. You probably don't feel like apologizing because you know that what you said was heartfelt. Don't let your dad guilt trip you into apologizing for something you meant to say. And it probably had to be said.\n\nI'm a bit concerned about the situation you describe in general. It gives me a DV sort of vibe. If there's actual violence happening, and that is why your brother is afraid to leave the house permanently, maybe you should get officials involved?", "Nta. \n\n\nWhen you set boudaries the one that screams the most are the one that used no boundaries to their advantage. \n\nYour dad tries to emotionally manipualate you.

Keep getting stronger and hopefully one day your mom will find her voice too. You do not need to apologise to toxic people.", "NTA - You live in an abusive household led by your father and fueled by Gma. You watched your mom be verbally beaten down to the point she shakes when the abuse begins, \"If this what you wanted....\".  It is normal to question your actions. Abusers like compliance.
