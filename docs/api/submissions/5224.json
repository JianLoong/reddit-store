He isn\u2019t all that terrible to me or my brother (17m) but he\u2019s horrible to our mom. \n\nGrowing up, it was very obvious that our dad saw our mom as \u201clesser than.\u201d He\u2019d yell at her over everything and made her responsible for everything. Cleaning, taking care of us, etc. My mom never said anything and tried her hardest to make it seem like everything was okay. \n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit, but I\u2019m too scared to stand up to my dad. I always freeze. My brother, on the other hand, does not give a shit. He yells back and isn\u2019t afraid of anything. \n\nI think my brother realized that I\u2019m too scared to protect our mom and recently told us that he\u2019s going to a college nearby and will be commuting as the college doesn\u2019t require first years to live on campus. \n\nMy parents were confused and my dad was a little upset. He kept telling him that he\u2018s going to miss out and he\u2019ll regret it but my brother didn\u2019t budge. Mom even told him that he should go and that she\u2019ll be fine. But my brother just said that they\u2019re lucky he\u2019s even going to college. \n\nWell yesterday we got a surprise visit from our grandma (dad\u2019s mom). She never visits and when she does, she also just treats my mom like shit so we weren\u2019t very excited. But we were civil because well if we aren\u2019t then she\u2019ll find a way to blame our mom.\n\nIt was okay at first but then she asked my mom: \u201cIs this what you wanted? Are you proud of yourself?\u201c My mom started to shake but my brother immediately got in between them. Grandma just rolled her eyes and asked my brother if he was really going to throw away his life just because he thinks his mom\u2019s too fragile to survive without him. My brother didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nI then spoke up and said \u201cit\u2019s not because of mom. It\u2019s because of you and dad. You guys are horrible and you really need to get the fuck out.\u201d \n\nMy grandma immediately started yelling at me. She said that she expected better and said that I\u2019m rude, disrespectful and bratty. She then told my mom that she raised horrible kids before leaving angrily. \n\nI know I was just standing up for my mom and my brother keeps telling me I\u2019m fine, but I feel guilty. My grandma apparently adores me according to my dad and I really broke her heart. And it\u2019s not like I made things better (maybe even worse).

I'm glad you were able to stand up to them. Your father is trying to manipulate you.  Don't let him.", "Gawd, the manipulation going on in this family is heartbreaking. I feel so sorry for y\u2019all.", "NTA\nOp, she loved your docility in the face of her aggression", "NTA.  OPs mom raised good kids.  Grandma raised a shitty little brat but she's a shitty little brat too.", "I don\u2019t get any adoring vibes there. Gaslighting? NTA", "You are strong and mature for your age, and showing a lot of resilience. I wish you all the success In the world and I hope one day you can help your mom get out too.", "Maybe also a legal consultation if you can get that for free in your state..", "I\u2019m tempted to tell someone especially after reading these comments so I talked to my brother just now but he got really mad then told me to not worry and just trust him. He said that we couldn\u2019t trust anyone else and that we just need to stick to the plan.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll talk to him again when he\u2019s in a better mood. I really think we can trust them. They\u2019re her siblings and our aunts/uncle.", "Echoing this. Please tell someone you trust - a teacher or a parents friend even. You are too young for this burden and it isn\u2019t fair.", "Yes, OP,  please let them know about the abuse. They might be able to offer your mom shelter as well as help you and your brother. And sometimes it helps if the abuser knows that someone is watching and will deal with him (and your grandmother) if anything happens to your mom until you can get her to safety.", "At the least it sounds emotionally abusive and possibly financially abusive as well. MANY Red flags here.", "Idk. She can\u2019t handle loud sounds and my grandma\u2019s also pretty intimidating. But I asked my brother just in case and he just told me not to worry about it. That just worried me even more but he\u2019s also in one of his moods so I\u2019ll talk to him later when he\u2019s less stressed.", "/u/OwnCoach8967 is a comment-stealing (paraphrasing) bot. Original comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqxnpx/aita_for_breaking_my_grandmas_heart/j10q5s6/", "One of the reasons that verbal and emotional abuse continues and spreads is that those involved can\u2019t or won\u2019t talk about it. I get where you\u2019re brothers coming from but it\u2019s not his job to fix this. It sounds like your brother wants to get through school, get a job and get you all away from your father. It\u2019s possible that that could happen sooner if your mothers family knew what was going on. Talk to your brother and let him know that you want to help.\n\nBe prepared or your mother to refuse to leave, even when help is offered. Your father and grandmother have conditioned her to accept the abuse and her self esteem is at rock bottom. She\u2019s afraid of them. No one knows the extent of the abuse she suffers when you aren\u2019t there so tread lightly but you\u2019re on the right path, keep walking it. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to a school counselor. They have access to resources you and your brother don\u2019t even know about. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t give a crap about your grandmas heart.", "Listen to the smart ones here. It is tough for everyone involved. You\u2019re not alone, and it isn\u2019t your of your brother\u2019s job to fix this\u2014 you\u2019re both (very mature) \u201ckids\u201d. I hope you feel comfortable enough to speak with a trusted adult. Ugh. Sending love.", "Same here, please talk to your mom's siblings about it, even if you may not see them as much now, which wouldn't surprise me with the horrible father, but they've reached out once, and they'll continue to be here, the fact that they even asked shows that they know what's up and are waiting for the first opportunity to get this man out of all your lives.\n\nGlad to see that you, your brother and your mom are supportive of each other though, keep fighting and talk to someone, you'll get through this OP", "As someone who works in the public sector, I can vouch that everything u/Fordwarrier has said is correct. Your intuition to reach out to a trusted adult is correct regardless of what your brother says. There are so many resources out there which can benefit you all. Even simply having someone at school who understands can change things dramatically. An advocate can help you navigate rough days and big emotions. You don\u2019t have to walk this path alone."]}
