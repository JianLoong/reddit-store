He isn\u2019t all that terrible to me or my brother (17m) but he\u2019s horrible to our mom. \n\nGrowing up, it was very obvious that our dad saw our mom as \u201clesser than.\u201d He\u2019d yell at her over everything and made her responsible for everything. Cleaning, taking care of us, etc. My mom never said anything and tried her hardest to make it seem like everything was okay. \n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit, but I\u2019m too scared to stand up to my dad. I always freeze. My brother, on the other hand, does not give a shit. He yells back and isn\u2019t afraid of anything. \n\nI think my brother realized that I\u2019m too scared to protect our mom and recently told us that he\u2019s going to a college nearby and will be commuting as the college doesn\u2019t require first years to live on campus. \n\nMy parents were confused and my dad was a little upset. He kept telling him that he\u2018s going to miss out and he\u2019ll regret it but my brother didn\u2019t budge. Mom even told him that he should go and that she\u2019ll be fine. But my brother just said that they\u2019re lucky he\u2019s even going to college. \n\nWell yesterday we got a surprise visit from our grandma (dad\u2019s mom). She never visits and when she does, she also just treats my mom like shit so we weren\u2019t very excited. But we were civil because well if we aren\u2019t then she\u2019ll find a way to blame our mom.\n\nIt was okay at first but then she asked my mom: \u201cIs this what you wanted? Are you proud of yourself?\u201c My mom started to shake but my brother immediately got in between them. Grandma just rolled her eyes and asked my brother if he was really going to throw away his life just because he thinks his mom\u2019s too fragile to survive without him. My brother didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nI then spoke up and said \u201cit\u2019s not because of mom. It\u2019s because of you and dad. You guys are horrible and you really need to get the fuck out.\u201d \n\nMy grandma immediately started yelling at me. She said that she expected better and said that I\u2019m rude, disrespectful and bratty. She then told my mom that she raised horrible kids before leaving angrily. \n\nI know I was just standing up for my mom and my brother keeps telling me I\u2019m fine, but I feel guilty. My grandma apparently adores me according to my dad and I really broke her heart. And it\u2019s not like I made things better (maybe even worse).

And in all honesty, by the time things would even make it to court, you would probably be 17, and most courts won't enforce a 17 yr old refusing to go see a parent. She does need to look for help.
