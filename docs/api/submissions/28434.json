It's your mother's decision not to drag, bribe, threaten, negotiate, or otherwise get you over there--both this year and over the incidents from years past.

They are free to do whatever they want for Thanksgiving. If they think your absence is making the holiday worse for them, then they ruined it themselves by the way they acted towards you. But it's not your responsibility to make sure they have a happy holiday.\n\nThey are getting mad at you for the way you are reacting without considering their actions that caused your reaction.  This isn't on you. Not wanting to be near them is a valid reaction to their behavior."]}
