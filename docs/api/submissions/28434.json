I have had a very toxic relationship with her since I was a kid. She says mean things to me and talks about me behind my back as well as my father too. For context when I was 12 my mom (her sister) was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 2 months and my aunt said it was all my fault she was there and my mom\u2019s life would be better if my dad and I weren\u2019t in around. Recently she has just been awful to me and my mom always defends her. I decided I didn\u2019t want to go to Thanksgiving this year and instead go with my boyfriend and his family. My mom is so mad at me that she told my aunt that no one is going to her house for Thanksgiving and basically won\u2019t even speak to me. I feel like I am not the asshole but I want other people\u2019s perspective on this because I have dealt with similar situations my whole life and at this point I don\u2019t want a relationship with my aunt or my mom.", "created_utc": 1696696286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172aget/aita_for_ruining_everyones_thanksgiving_this_year/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Better for your well being that you dont, imho", "NTA\n\nCut all the toxic people from your life.

It's your mother's decision not to drag, bribe, threaten, negotiate, or otherwise get you over there--both this year and over the incidents from years past.
