Something he's spent a lot of that time on is cooking. Now he IS a really good cook.\n\nHe and his husband have a decent-sized house so a lot of our routine family dinners are held at their place and my brother volunteers to cook most of the time. When he does, without fail as soon as our parents come through the door or we do, it's always \"Smells really good in here doesn't it?\" \"Damn you were making me hungry from the street.\" or things along those lines and they keep saying such things throughout our time there. At first I didn't think one way or another about it, but we're going on well over two years of this happening.\n\nThey never give compliments if I or our other siblings have them over. They didn't say anything about the murals my brother and his wife painted on their walls, very big and hard to miss, until they pointed right at them and asked about it and all our parents said was 'oh that's nice'. Our sister is always making bath bombs and candles for her home business, so her place always smells nice too and they don't say anything about that or encourage her. They just don't give any compliments or acknowledge anything about us, our hobbies, or our homes but they go overboard with our brother. It's not like they neglected him as a kid and it's some attempt to make up for it, they gave us all pretty equal attention and support growing up.\n\nThis last time having dinner at my brother's house, I was telling my family about how excited I was for my fiance to be starting his dream job. My siblings were happy for him but our parents didn't say anything and went right back to singing their praises of the second coming of culinary Jesus and how he should start a food truck. I was pretty done at that and instead of being there in an irritated mood, I waited a few minutes and acted like I had gotten a text from a friend and had to go. Said my byes and 'loves yous' and left. A little while later my mom called and asked what was wrong because my family had noticed my phone screen was dark when I pulled it out so they didn't buy the text story. I told her I just didn't have it in me to sit through another dinner where they forget they have 3 other children with things going on in their lives they'd like some acknowledgment from them over. I\u2019ve been at odds a bit with my parents and them telling me I\u2019m being immature. My siblings found out why we\u2019re currently fighting and our brother and his wife are in agreement with me and said they\u2019ve been getting tired of it too. I\u2019ve apologized to my brother, but not my parents. So AITA?\n\nEdit: We bring dishes or someone else cooks when we have dinner at his house and he doesn't want to cook. We also have meals at our houses, and there isn't a peep from our parents. On one hand, yes, he is a better cook and he should get at least a \"Hey this is good\" but when they're taking home half of my SIL's pie when they eat there, she doesn't get anything but a thanks. They use a lot of the products my sister makes, free of charge, and also don't say anything besides thanks, and will stay hands off helping her promote but they were quick to jump in and tell our brother to go open a food truck and ideas to go about it.", "created_utc": 1689185176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xvzst/aita_leaving_a_family_gathering_due_to_my_parents/", "score": 1486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe he's secretly adopted and he nearly found out, so they think they have to butter him up to keep it quiet. Maybe he's blackmailing them somehow and part if it is if they don't praise him this way then he's going to retaliate in a certain way. Idk. Parents do sometimes play favorites or exhibit odd behavior when they are guilty for something but this is definitely weird.\n\nBTW, in case anybody cares, Theresa dropped out of college, is an alcoholic, and last I understood nobody has heard from her in like 3 or 4 years \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "what if your brother is just actually THAT good? lmao", "Soft YTA.

I guess the most charitable explanation, maybe your brother's cooking (not just the quality, but also the specifics of what he makes) is just something they really happen to like, and not much else impresses them. If that's the way it is, this sounds strangely like the story of Cain and Abel. My partner just got Steinbeck's 'East of Eden' from the book store so I've been thinking about that story again. It's a weird story to grapple with. Is God an asshole for preferring meat to veggies? Maybe God can have preferences too. Kind of seems like a dick move to me though, if both sons bring an offering that's meant in earnest, seems to me you should appreciate both. But maybe that's more the Christ perspective than the old testament perspective. If you haven't read it, it's well worthwhile and might in some small way help you come to terms with your parent's failure on this.\n\nIf it's not about the cooking though... I don't know. Sounds like a good thing to spend some time talking through with a therapist or something, these kinds of things are really complicated to decide how you feel about them. Complicated enough for Steinbeck to basically write a whole book on the topic.\n\nEither way, you're not the asshole. It's confusing at best, offensive at worst for your parents to do that. If they were wise, emotionally healthy people they would know better, but few people are. One of the strangest parts of becoming an adult was realizing I'd outgrown both my parents in different ways. Not in every way of course, but seeing the poor choices, false beliefs, ignorance... parents go from PARENTS to just people all of a sudden, flawed like anyone else. Sometimes much more so than anyone else even.\n\nGood luck getting your head on straight about this, but you'll be lucky if they ever understand all this for what it is, or feel the need to offer an apology.
