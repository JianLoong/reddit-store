Something he's spent a lot of that time on is cooking. Now he IS a really good cook.\n\nHe and his husband have a decent-sized house so a lot of our routine family dinners are held at their place and my brother volunteers to cook most of the time. When he does, without fail as soon as our parents come through the door or we do, it's always \"Smells really good in here doesn't it?\" \"Damn you were making me hungry from the street.\" or things along those lines and they keep saying such things throughout our time there. At first I didn't think one way or another about it, but we're going on well over two years of this happening.\n\nThey never give compliments if I or our other siblings have them over. They didn't say anything about the murals my brother and his wife painted on their walls, very big and hard to miss, until they pointed right at them and asked about it and all our parents said was 'oh that's nice'. Our sister is always making bath bombs and candles for her home business, so her place always smells nice too and they don't say anything about that or encourage her. They just don't give any compliments or acknowledge anything about us, our hobbies, or our homes but they go overboard with our brother. It's not like they neglected him as a kid and it's some attempt to make up for it, they gave us all pretty equal attention and support growing up.\n\nThis last time having dinner at my brother's house, I was telling my family about how excited I was for my fiance to be starting his dream job. My siblings were happy for him but our parents didn't say anything and went right back to singing their praises of the second coming of culinary Jesus and how he should start a food truck. I was pretty done at that and instead of being there in an irritated mood, I waited a few minutes and acted like I had gotten a text from a friend and had to go. Said my byes and 'loves yous' and left. A little while later my mom called and asked what was wrong because my family had noticed my phone screen was dark when I pulled it out so they didn't buy the text story. I told her I just didn't have it in me to sit through another dinner where they forget they have 3 other children with things going on in their lives they'd like some acknowledgment from them over. I\u2019ve been at odds a bit with my parents and them telling me I\u2019m being immature. My siblings found out why we\u2019re currently fighting and our brother and his wife are in agreement with me and said they\u2019ve been getting tired of it too. I\u2019ve apologized to my brother, but not my parents. So AITA?\n\nEdit: We bring dishes or someone else cooks when we have dinner at his house and he doesn't want to cook. We also have meals at our houses, and there isn't a peep from our parents. On one hand, yes, he is a better cook and he should get at least a \"Hey this is good\" but when they're taking home half of my SIL's pie when they eat there, she doesn't get anything but a thanks. They use a lot of the products my sister makes, free of charge, and also don't say anything besides thanks, and will stay hands off helping her promote but they were quick to jump in and tell our brother to go open a food truck and ideas to go about it.", "created_utc": 1689185176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xvzst/aita_leaving_a_family_gathering_due_to_my_parents/", "score": 3317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did you ever consider that they might just be to your parents' tastes? \n\nYou say the bath bombs smell good. Well, maybe to you. As someone with olfactory sensitivity, walking into a bath bomb factory would be an assault on my senses and a migraine trigger. Maybe your parents are the same. Even if they're not, has your sister ever given them bath bombs? Are they even bath-takers? \n\nYour fianc\u00e9's new job definitely deserves acknowledgment, but again, doesn't do much for your parents compared to food in their belly. \n\nBasically, they're self-absorbed.

It's a weird story to grapple with. Is God an asshole for preferring meat to veggies? Maybe God can have preferences too. Kind of seems like a dick move to me though, if both sons bring an offering that's meant in earnest, seems to me you should appreciate both.

Yes, feelings, meaning emotions, can be adjusted; I've had to do so many times in life for my own comfort and sanity and it can be such a game changer. You and your siblings may have to suck this one up; you're all adults and old enough to know that validation comes from within (clich\u00e9, I know) not to mention that you all can cheer each other on as much as possible. Waiting for praise from our parents can be futile and a very lonely fight for many of us, so an extremely mature attitude needs to be adopted in order for you guys to be able to congregate as a family in peace in harmony. With a little time and effort, I will assure you while you won't turn into a complete robot, this will begin to bother you less and less until it gets to the point that you'll barely even notice it anymore. Your parents may actually ease up over time if they notice that no one seems to even acknowledge their exaggerated praises to brother anymore. I'm definitely not saying to just blindly put up with your parents' crap, I'm just giving an alternative to letting this drive you all nuts just in case your parents continue this and do what a lot of older parents tend to do, which is not make any corrections.

I was in my late 30's before she had anything nice to say about me.  She does it now but it just feels weird.  But she never ever recognized it.  NEVER.  Never ever acknowledged it.

No.  The only thing you did was call them out on their behavior by simply stating it.

I mean it's kind of a cliche that old men get excited for their dinner or whatever. \n\nJobs are FINE. But not everyone is going to find them exciting. Of course this still makes the parents jerks for not even being polite about it, but I can see why they might not find much to say depending on what it is.

Your frustration is solely with your parents.\n\nIf it were people you saw only once a year, I'd suggest you turn it into a personal game (drink a small toast every time they praise your brother) - something you could go home and laugh about.

Is it restaurant quality absolutely ? Is it good enough that he really could have a food truck ,is that good ? or are your parents exaggerating. Also what the hell did he make can you please tell me what dishes he served at night I\u2019m getting hungry just reading about it.", "Are your parents into food like are they people who really enjoy restaurants and are appreciative of good cooking in general, Is cooking and food there a particular thing? \nDo you think this is more about your brother or about the actual food .", "Do they complement him about other things or is it just the cooking ? \nmaybe it\u2019s really just about the food ? \nBefore your brother started cooking did your parents give compliment to you and ur siblings regularly?", "yeah, i mean , i support my children either way but it\u2019s true that they will potentially experience a more difficult path if not heterosexual - less potential partners, more societal bigotry, etc. \n\nI love my girls so much & I\u2019m blessed that they trust me enough to open up to me about their personal lives.", "haha.my eldest is bi, she\u2019s had enough time to experiment and grow, to be sure about it. \n\nMy youngest thinks she might be but isn\u2019t sure yet & god i hope i\u2019m doing right by them both when i have told each one that they would come to know for sure in time, in their own time & that they are still growing ( one\u2019s a teen & one is just 12) \n\nI\u2019ve advised them to hopefully not let peer pressure or societal expectations make them feel they have to declare their orientation. \n\nI just want them to be happy either way, like most parents i guess?", "My thoughts exactly. They are overcompensating for their son being gay and don't want to be seen as homophobic, which generally is the source of overcompensation.\n\nOP was right to leave the \"performance\" that has become tired and overused.", "Not all golden children are born golden.\n\nMany are gilded with age.", "I don't think they want the gay son to be \"loved\" as much as they don't want to be seen as homophobic. Their hetero children don't need the \"performance\"."]}
