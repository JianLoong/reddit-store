They just don't give any compliments or acknowledge anything about us, our hobbies, or our homes but they go overboard with our brother.

I was pretty done at that and instead of being there in an irritated mood, I waited a few minutes and acted like I had gotten a text from a friend and had to go.

It doesn't sound like you lashed out, you just exited a situation you'd seen before and that you knew would be unpleasant and unfair...you drew some boundaries. Maybe it was clunkily executed and now it's brought the whole thing to light but ultimately that's probably for the best, maybe it'll open their eyes.", "NTA --- It's not fun to have to sit there and listen to the favourite child being praised to heaven even if it is unintentional, you have every right to be upset and angry about it.", "Nta at all blatant favoritism followed by a smidgen bit of gaslighting", "NTA. The recognition your parents give to your brother seems excessive based on what you\u2019re saying here. If everyone else notices it too, then it\u2019s not just you. Parents need to come to grips with reality and start being more interested in the ambitions of their other children before their relationships are ruined by showing such blatant favoritism.", "Honestly you wouldn't be the asshole for leaving a family gathering like that, good on you for suppressing your emotions. I probably would have gotten rather heated. People shouldn't always expect praise, but you should expect your other kids to get irritated when you only give one of them any praise. NTA!", "INFO:   Was this brother always the golden child or did this start as a campaign to \"support\" his coming out?", "NTA - I'm sorry your parents aren't treating you fairly. The fact that your siblings agree and understand is further proof that your parent's favor is noticeable and not okay. Loving and complimenting is cooking is great and they should keep doing that, but they should want to praise you guys as well. Love is not pie, taking a big slice for one child should not leave less for others. It is supposed to be infinite.", "NTA, its like favouritism thats begun at adult hood? Its strange but obviously I can see why this upsets you.\n\nThey really come accross like they dont care, its sad", "NTA, that brother is the golden child and can do no wrong.  You and the other sibs can do no right.  Sucks rocks.", "NTA. I'm sure your parents don't like being called out on it, but it sounds like maybe it was time that they were if it's been this consistent and obvious for a long time. If they think there's nothing wrong with their behavior, there's really nothing you can do, but you have every right to have your feelings about it as well.", "NTA\n\nEven your brother is tired of it.  Sorry, but your parent's favorite isn't you.  It sucks.", "Imo this doesn\u2019t sound like OP needs constant praise, just that they want equal attention as a member of the family (the parents didn\u2019t really respond to OP\u2019s news about fianc\u00e9\u2019s dream job- I mean, they could at least pretend to be interested/ask questions). I think OP is NTA here- they pretty low key let their parents know the issue. Now it\u2019s up to the parents: do they try to be more interested in OP\u2019s life? If they don\u2019t then they shouldn\u2019t be surprised if OP disengages/goes LC.", "NTA. Is your brother the first born male or something? Your parents are jerks for not recognizing their other kids accomplishments.", "NTA. You handled the situation well.", "Nta but they aren\u2019t over complementing him, they shouldn\u2019t reduce their compliments to him.  They just need to be more aware of their other kids and be as kind\n\nThere is ridiculous favoritism here.  Now, they may be more familiar with cooking and value it more, making it worse, but their jobs as parents is to do better.", "Info: do you ever do any group activities of any of your dinners? Or do y'all just do rotating family dinners? Is your sister actually giving bath Bombs and candles to your parents, or just reminding them that that's what she does for work? Do you paint with them?", "YTA.\n\nWhen they're complimenting him, they're thanking him for doing something *specifically to benefit them:* cooking for them.\n\nI mean, it might be worth it to have an adult conversation with them about, hey, you sometimes seem more interested in what bro is doing than what the rest of us are, but it sounds like you've framed this (in your mind) in a super negative way, and you're comparing things that aren't alike.\n\nComplimenting a meal someone cooked for you, or expressing anticipation for it when you can smell it, are basic good manners. \n\nIt's a very different thing from a mural that someone is painting, or a bath bomb scent. I mean, yeah, would it be nice for them to express more interest? Sure. But it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.", "YTA. It sounds like your brother is an extraordinary cook, which is why they are raining compliments on him. It sounds like they do not really give compliments in general, so just because they praise his cooking ability does not mean they should start praising everyone to make it \"fair.\" This is not the Participation Olympics; not everyone gets a trophy.", "YTA. \n\nIt seems that this is an issue you've had for a while, and instead of acting like an adult and using your words, you got up and left a dinner.  I'd say this behavior is kind of immature. \n\nAlso, its possible that they have info about your brother that you don't, and there is a reason they are overdoing it with him, and also why they haven't shared it with you.  I'm in my 40s and I only just now learned some pretty major stuff about my brother.  My mom didn't want to tell me because frankly it wasn't my business, but she eventually did as a way to explain some of his behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't make a scene, you didn't make a fuss. But them now calling you immature for an answer to a question they asked? Seems they don't like that yall have caught on.", "No they were pretty good about giving us all equal attention and avoid showing favoritism. My brother has been out for a very long time and they were supportive from the start, this only started in the last few years after he'd been married for a good while.", "Oof. I felt that and I\u2019m way over here!", "Sometimes we do activities. Beside rotating family dinners, for birthdays or milestones or a 'just cause' to try something new we have dinners at our places as well and its crickets. Also crickets when we do a potluck deal. My sister gives bath bombs, candles, and sugar scrubs to our parents, especially our mom. Sometimes we'll help her fill up baskets when we're at her house or she needs an extra hand because she's short on time. \n\nWe didn't paint with my brother and SIL, that was their own project they spent like half a year on.

Your children shouldn\u2019t have to pry at you to get you to even acknowledge small things about their lives.

If that were all there was to it, your judgement would be unassailable.\n\nThe one problem is that apparently these compliments to the cook only occur when the brother cooks and never with it's one of the siblings hosting and cooking. That's bound to be noticed and grate.", "Agreed.  Like its really possible his cooking is on another level compared to the bath bombs and murals.", ">  my parents and them telling me I\u2019m being immature. \n\nSo they dismiss your concerns then go back to their default assholey behavior.   You were not wrong to call them out.   If I were you, I would keep up the pressure.   The next time you are invited to a family get together, ask you parents whether they plan to acknowledge their other 3 kids will it be more the same.   If they try to deflect by calling you childish or immature, tell them you won't be attending.   And make sure that all of your siblings know what went down.", "So would it kill the parents to engage with other siblings?  Is it that hard to show interest in all siblings. Of course golden child doesn\u2019t agree", "OP\u2019s brother should secretly cook at OP\u2019s house without parents\u2019 knowledge", "I was thinking they could just really complimenting things that directly bring them benefits? Like they get to eat the food, but the mural is not for them, and maybe they don't like/recieve bathbombs?\n\nMaybe more about parents' own gains and \"attention\" to themselves rather than attention to the brother.\n\nI don't think OP is an asshole for feeling neglected or unseen by the parents, but it might not be as much \"cook brother is so wonderful and let's praise him up all the time \" and more \"I love when I can eat delicious food and make remarks to the person who cooks to encourage/enforce it happening\"", "That is a great idea!"]}
