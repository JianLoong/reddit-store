We were talking about this during dinner and my step father cuts in and says \u201cOh that would be a nice family holiday\u201d. I never liked my stepfather or his family to begin with so I hated this idea. His children M(15F), R(21M) and B(24M) has always disliked me from since we first met. We were planning to go to Japan for this graduation gift but japan has a lot of walking from place to place and there would be nothing my stepfathers kids would enjoy there as we are planning to go to a lot of anime and Pok\u00e9mon things there in japan. (I\u2019m saying this because none of my stepfathers kids enjoys walking or any sort of anime in general, and whenever we do something they don\u2019t like they always complain about how everything is so boring) So I tried to say how it might be a bad idea seeing as it will be quite expensive for 6 people and seeing as 4 of those will only want to stay in a hotel room and do nothing, I explained it in the nicest way I could trying to get him to see that it would be a bad idea without me telling him I don\u2019t want him or his kids there. So after 5 minutes of me trying to explain why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for him and his kids to go he absolutely blew up at me and starting yelling at me and calling me a selfish brat and how my mother always does everything for me. (My mother always misses out on all of my school reward ceremonies because of his kids, and they\u2019re also always down for the school holidays and any other holiday we have overseas.) His reasoning for him and his kids to come along with us was \u201cit would be great family bonding, plus you always have your mother to yourself\u201d (my mother works 6am-7pm most days so I  never see her if she\u2019s home because she\u2019s normally just cooking dinner and going off to bed just to repeat this almost everyday. And when she finally gets a day off my step father is always doing something with her for most of the day so once again I don\u2019t have anytime to spend with her).\n\nSo aita for me just wanting the holiday to be me and my mother for my graduation present, and not wanting my stepfather or his kids to come?\n\nEdit 1: My mother had a talk to my stepfather about how this was planned that it was just going to be her and I just for a little something for not being there for my past graduations. I overheard him saying \u201cwell it\u2019s unfair that she gets everything she wants and my kids get nothing. Plus you can\u2019t just exclude my kids, they\u2019re your kids as well (adoptive not biological) you make enough money for you to take us all not just your biological daughter.\u201d\n\nMy mother came to talk to me afterwards about what we were now going to do because it was \u201cinconsiderate to his kids and how I wouldn\u2019t like it if they went on a holiday and left me behind\u201d so she suggested for a cheaper option for 6 people such as Bali, so him and his kids could just stay at a resort since they wouldn\u2019t have to do much walking. (Bali was my stepfathers idea because he has always wanted to go to Bali and he and his kids can just stay at the resort and not go anywhere). The problem with this is that, my stepfather doesn\u2019t have custody of me, it\u2019s spilt between my biological father and mother. So unless I\u2019m 18 I most likely won\u2019t be able to go to Bali because of the rules. (Yes im aware that this is in 2 years from now but we were thinking of going in September and I turn 18 in December) \n\nMy mother said that she would talk about it more in the morning but it\u2019s now most likely that we will be going to Bali instead and I most likely won\u2019t be able to come along. Something might change after she realizes this but I\u2019m not 100% sure", "created_utc": 1670238090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd3v8r/aita_for_saying_my_step_siblings_cant_come_on_a/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As long as you have a valid passport you should be able to go unless they have some new rule. I\u2019ve been to Bali and it\u2019s beautiful and lots of places for you and mom to explore alone.", "NTA , it's your thing with your mom. He doesn't get to butt in. Hell, even if he wasn't a step father, but a father and you wanted to go with only your mom, it would still be a normal thing. Children spending time with only one family member sometimes, and not the whole family is normal.\n\nBasically the same thing happenned to me with my father's wife a few years ago. Needless to say, we don't really get along anymore (dad's wife and I).", "NTA\n\nThe stepfather is selfish and greedy. That's all. It's YOUR gift for YOUR graduation. Simple as that. YOU get to decide with your mom.\n\nIn this situation, if Mom chose him over me, I'd cut off contact with her as soon as possible. Harsh, maybe, but if Mom can't shine her spine, I'll just use mine.", "NTA. I have a son from a previous relationship and a son with my fianc\u00e9. I plan stuff for just me and my older son because he deserves 1:1 time and there\u2019s a big age gap, the baby requires a lot of attention and I want to ensure he knows he is loved and not forgotten.", "This makes me furious. This is meant as a present for you. Bonding time with your mother is a normal thing to want and not everything has to be for the 'whole family', especially if it's meant to be your graduation gift. \nYour mom's husband sounds so entitled and I know since you're only 16 your options are limited but you are NOT the asshole, don't let him get into your head. \nThis is like your mom promising to bake your favourite cake for your birthday and then getting something entirely different because one of the guests you didn't even invite doesn't like the flavour. And her husband yelling at you for being sad about it. \nIt is okay for some things being about you. It is okay to want some things just for yourself.\n\nNTA", "You 100% have the right to be upset that people who openly don\u2019t like you and you don\u2019t get along with are hijacking YOUR graduation gift and turning it into something you won\u2019t even be able to go to. Maybe time to talk to your dad about more time with him and less time with people who are treating you like Cinderella.\n\nEdit: reading back the ages of his kids 2 of them have already had their graduations probably from Uni too and I\u2019m sure had special gifts that were just for them. They are full blown adults not small children I\u2019m sure they will get over it. If they want a trip to Bali they can go ahead and go and you and your mom can have your trip from sounding like none of you would be spending time together during the trip anyway.", "NTA- and you are both being manipulated. This is a celebration for YOUR graduation. Do they expect that they will also receive birthday presents when it is someone else's birthday. \n\nI'm a bit petty and were I in your shoes, I would choose this hill to die on. I would tell mother- it's fine- go with your husband and his children to bali. I will stay here. I suppose the ultimate graduation present will be when I am able to fully support myself an no longer subject to step-dad's manipulation, although I am very sad you are cooperating with him in breaking our relationship, it is clear that you are making this choice.", "NTA. I'm sorry, but I would just be saying thank you, but no, thank you to the whole trip. It's not about being petulant or cutting your nose off to spite your face it's about removing yourself from a toxic situation. You know this won't be enjoyable for you, you know you won't get your mothers attention while her husband is there and you can bet they'll gaslight you on the whole trip while making it all about themselves. \n\nThis is meant to be a treat for you. If it's not, find another way to celebrate all your hard work.", "This is a discussion that should be between you and your mother.\n\nHowever, YTA for just assuming that everyone else is just going to sit in the hotel and do nothing.  There is something for everyone in Japan.  \n\nTake a step back for a second.  There's talk of a massive holiday trip.  To a place you want to go.  And you're trying to box out everyone else.  \n\nJust be happy about the trip.", "I think you're NTA for wanting this special treat for a special occasion to be just about you and your mom, and I think stepdad should be able to understand this.\nI also think it's a discussion your mom should have had with her husband before making any promises to you, because, well, a faraway trip is kind of a big thing that should be discussed as a couple. But that's a separate issue.\nThis said, I also sense from the rest of your message that there's a fair bit of resentment and maybe even jealousy on your side because you have to share your mom with strangers. And I totally get that, but I also get your stepdad (and probably your mom as well!) wanting you all to bond and get along, even if from your account he was going about it in completely the wrong way.\nImagine for a second the situation was reversed and one of your stepbrothers told your mom \"dad and I are off to the other end of the world for 2 weeks and we don't want you to come\". Don't you think she'd be hurt? Stepdad probably is too.\nI know from where you're standing it sucks, but the family unit is now bigger than just you and mom. There's probably not much you can do to change that fact, but how you deal with it is up to you.\nJust my two cents.", "NTA I think this is a great idea..if the father pays and two of the kids sit in a hotel then who cares. That being said sometimes it's just best to say nothing and see how things evolve.", "There\u2019s a rule in Australia if you only live with one parent and the other one is still alive and has custody of you you have to get both parents to sign paperwork about the child laws in Bali because the custody rules are different (if that makes sense, sorry im not the best at explaining things) so like my mother and I could move to Bali and the government wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything because of the different laws in Bali about parent custody", "It's OP's graduation trip? Why wouldn't they want to spend it with the only person they actually care about?", "Ok your biological dad won\u2019t sign off? Edit you explained it well. If bio dad won\u2019t sign off I\u2019d point out to mom I hope they enjoy my graduation trip in Bali since I will not be able to go."]}
