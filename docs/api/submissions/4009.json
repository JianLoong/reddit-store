We were talking about this during dinner and my step father cuts in and says \u201cOh that would be a nice family holiday\u201d. I never liked my stepfather or his family to begin with so I hated this idea. His children M(15F), R(21M) and B(24M) has always disliked me from since we first met. We were planning to go to Japan for this graduation gift but japan has a lot of walking from place to place and there would be nothing my stepfathers kids would enjoy there as we are planning to go to a lot of anime and Pok\u00e9mon things there in japan. (I\u2019m saying this because none of my stepfathers kids enjoys walking or any sort of anime in general, and whenever we do something they don\u2019t like they always complain about how everything is so boring) So I tried to say how it might be a bad idea seeing as it will be quite expensive for 6 people and seeing as 4 of those will only want to stay in a hotel room and do nothing, I explained it in the nicest way I could trying to get him to see that it would be a bad idea without me telling him I don\u2019t want him or his kids there. So after 5 minutes of me trying to explain why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for him and his kids to go he absolutely blew up at me and starting yelling at me and calling me a selfish brat and how my mother always does everything for me. (My mother always misses out on all of my school reward ceremonies because of his kids, and they\u2019re also always down for the school holidays and any other holiday we have overseas.) His reasoning for him and his kids to come along with us was \u201cit would be great family bonding, plus you always have your mother to yourself\u201d (my mother works 6am-7pm most days so I  never see her if she\u2019s home because she\u2019s normally just cooking dinner and going off to bed just to repeat this almost everyday. And when she finally gets a day off my step father is always doing something with her for most of the day so once again I don\u2019t have anytime to spend with her).\n\nSo aita for me just wanting the holiday to be me and my mother for my graduation present, and not wanting my stepfather or his kids to come?\n\nEdit 1: My mother had a talk to my stepfather about how this was planned that it was just going to be her and I just for a little something for not being there for my past graduations. I overheard him saying \u201cwell it\u2019s unfair that she gets everything she wants and my kids get nothing. Plus you can\u2019t just exclude my kids, they\u2019re your kids as well (adoptive not biological) you make enough money for you to take us all not just your biological daughter.\u201d\n\nMy mother came to talk to me afterwards about what we were now going to do because it was \u201cinconsiderate to his kids and how I wouldn\u2019t like it if they went on a holiday and left me behind\u201d so she suggested for a cheaper option for 6 people such as Bali, so him and his kids could just stay at a resort since they wouldn\u2019t have to do much walking. (Bali was my stepfathers idea because he has always wanted to go to Bali and he and his kids can just stay at the resort and not go anywhere). The problem with this is that, my stepfather doesn\u2019t have custody of me, it\u2019s spilt between my biological father and mother. So unless I\u2019m 18 I most likely won\u2019t be able to go to Bali because of the rules. (Yes im aware that this is in 2 years from now but we were thinking of going in September and I turn 18 in December) \n\nMy mother said that she would talk about it more in the morning but it\u2019s now most likely that we will be going to Bali instead and I most likely won\u2019t be able to come along. Something might change after she realizes this but I\u2019m not 100% sure", "created_utc": 1670238090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd3v8r/aita_for_saying_my_step_siblings_cant_come_on_a/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hell, even if he wasn't a step father, but a father and you wanted to go with only your mom, it would still be a normal thing.

This is meant as a present for you.

And her husband yelling at you for being sad about it. \nIt is okay for some things being about you. It is okay to want some things just for yourself.\n\nNTA", "You 100% have the right to be upset that people who openly don\u2019t like you and you don\u2019t get along with are hijacking YOUR graduation gift and turning it into something you won\u2019t even be able to go to. Maybe time to talk to your dad about more time with him and less time with people who are treating you like Cinderella.\n\nEdit: reading back the ages of his kids 2 of them have already had their graduations probably from Uni too and I\u2019m sure had special gifts that were just for them. They are full blown adults not small children I\u2019m sure they will get over it. If they want a trip to Bali they can go ahead and go and you and your mom can have your trip from sounding like none of you would be spending time together during the trip anyway.", "NTA- and you are both being manipulated. This is a celebration for YOUR graduation. Do they expect that they will also receive birthday presents when it is someone else's birthday. \n\nI'm a bit petty and were I in your shoes, I would choose this hill to die on. I would tell mother- it's fine- go with your husband and his children to bali. I will stay here. I suppose the ultimate graduation present will be when I am able to fully support myself an no longer subject to step-dad's manipulation, although I am very sad you are cooperating with him in breaking our relationship, it is clear that you are making this choice.", "NTA. I'm sorry, but I would just be saying thank you, but no, thank you to the whole trip. It's not about being petulant or cutting your nose off to spite your face it's about removing yourself from a toxic situation. You know this won't be enjoyable for you, you know you won't get your mothers attention while her husband is there and you can bet they'll gaslight you on the whole trip while making it all about themselves. \n\nThis is meant to be a treat for you. If it's not, find another way to celebrate all your hard work.", "This is a discussion that should be between you and your mother.\n\nHowever, YTA for just assuming that everyone else is just going to sit in the hotel and do nothing.  There is something for everyone in Japan.  \n\nTake a step back for a second.  There's talk of a massive holiday trip.  To a place you want to go.  And you're trying to box out everyone else.  \n\nJust be happy about the trip.", "I think you're NTA for wanting this special treat for a special occasion to be just about you and your mom, and I think stepdad should be able to understand this.\nI also think it's a discussion your mom should have had with her husband before making any promises to you, because, well, a faraway trip is kind of a big thing that should be discussed as a couple. But that's a separate issue.\nThis said, I also sense from the rest of your message that there's a fair bit of resentment and maybe even jealousy on your side because you have to share your mom with strangers. And I totally get that, but I also get your stepdad (and probably your mom as well!) wanting you all to bond and get along, even if from your account he was going about it in completely the wrong way.\nImagine for a second the situation was reversed and one of your stepbrothers told your mom \"dad and I are off to the other end of the world for 2 weeks and we don't want you to come\". Don't you think she'd be hurt? Stepdad probably is too.\nI know from where you're standing it sucks, but the family unit is now bigger than just you and mom. There's probably not much you can do to change that fact, but how you deal with it is up to you.\nJust my two cents.", "NTA I think this is a great idea..if the father pays and two of the kids sit in a hotel then who cares. That being said sometimes it's just best to say nothing and see how things evolve.", "There\u2019s a rule in Australia if you only live with one parent and the other one is still alive and has custody of you you have to get both parents to sign paperwork about the child laws in Bali because the custody rules are different (if that makes sense, sorry im not the best at explaining things) so like my mother and I could move to Bali and the government wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything because of the different laws in Bali about parent custody", "It's OP's graduation trip? Why wouldn't they want to spend it with the only person they actually care about?", "Ok your biological dad won\u2019t sign off? Edit you explained it well. If bio dad won\u2019t sign off I\u2019d point out to mom I hope they enjoy my graduation trip in Bali since I will not be able to go.", "Hi OP, this is supposed to be a travel to celebrate your graduation. You are NTA, but if it were me I'll just tell my mom to not bother including me on that Bali trip since your Stepdad bulldozed his way on your trip. I hope your mom think about this long and hard. She has been prioritizing other people over you.", "NTA\n\nYour mother planned this as a graduation gift originally. You need to inform her this is no longer a graduation gift, but your stepfather's vacation. Furthermore, I'd bring up that Bali is not your idea of fun and you will likely be unable to go if she pursues it, especially before deposits are made. I'd also make it very clear that it is definitely not a graduation gift if she refuses to take your input into account. \n\nIt is also fair to express disappointment because this was something you guys had planned together, and she's going back on it because it doesn't suit your stepfather's tastes", "How is she going on a graduation trip for you, without you?", "NTA but I would just let your mom know that you hope she, step dad and stepkids have fun because you don't want to go.  Be like, can you just give me the money for Japan and I can see if dad can go since you are busy.", "NTA I'm sorry your step father is a jealous jerk. Also, Japan is wonderful, Bali is way overrated. The beaches are frequently filthy with washed up plastic and other marine pollution and unless you're staying at the really luxurious resorts or renting a private villa, it's not very nice.\n\nThere's a difference when one parent goes on a special trip with an individual child than when a whole family goes away leaving one behind. Your mother's logic is flawed.", "NTA I\u2019d tell your mom that you wanted a trip with you two to do the things you wanted to do not some random Bali resort you have no interest in. So I\u2019d tell her just to plan the trip for them and see what her reaction is because it\u2019s not fair that a grown man gets to be petty to a teenager. second it has nothing to do with them it\u2019s a graduate present for you and your hard work not 2 adults and a 15 year old you don\u2019t have a relationship with.", "NTA and your mother is a huge one for not having your back on this. Stepfather and siblings are of course the bigger assholes.\n\nTell your mother in no uncertain terms that she has to choose between you and the others this time.", "NTA. But my petty ass would make a list of all the events your mother have missed for his kids. \n\nTell your mom, we either go to Japan you and I, or i leave with dad.", "NTA your mum really needs to stand by you here.", "NTA - But if I were you, I would just casually drop the bomb at dinner, \"Oh, mom said we're going to Bali. I can't wait to have a nice holiday with mom and my dad.\" \nAnd then when they ask you to explain... explain the rules.", "NTA if she went back on the trip for you 2 over your stepfather bring a baby I'd just cut her out my life. But that's me.", "Nta.  Let them go to bali and ask for the money to get out of that place as soon as you can", "NTA. Nice idea mom. Thanks, but no thanks. Its' a graduation gift to enjoy. Not a family vacation to stress. Repeat to mom how steps treat you.", "NTA. I think he wants to go to Bali because you can't go. He's a selfish hypocrite to demand that his kids not be excluded but he keeps excluding you. And your mother is wrong to let him treat you so badly again and again.", "Girl, you NTA but your stepfather bites the big one. Im sorry you are going through this. Seems like's his bullying has won over your mom and you will lost your trip, as he anticipated and planned for. Seems like he has been trying to edge you out for awhile?", "Nta! And your mom needs to wake tf up, like how can she in any shape or form live with herself as mother by allowing her husband to scream at you!? That's messed up. I don't understand mother's who are okay with this and don't put their own kid's wellbeing before a new spouse. Op, you deserve to go alone with your mom. Her husband can stick it.", "NTA. Your mom needs to get rid of your stepfather.", "This honestly is really sad, maybe show this post to your mother and she'll see that she's being horrible by letting your gift become a gift for your stepdad. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis is your graduation present, not a family holiday. A present for you, not for him and his children! Two of whom are adults by several years!!\n\nAlso, how come your mom has to pay for his children to go on holiday? Why isn\u2019t your stepfather paying for his children? He can pay for himself and them to go to lounge at a resort in Bali where they\u2019ll probably do nothing more than they would do if they had gone to a resort in Florida, or Spain or whatever is close to you and cheap.\n\nWhat does this man even bring to the table that your mom works 12 hour days and cooks after coming home before dragging herself to bed? But she\u2019s the one making good money and he\u2019s demanding to dictate what she gives you as a graduation present and mooching vacations for himself and his children!!\n\nYour mom needs to dump him.", "NTA. Talk to her again op, sit her down and explain how upset you are that she constantly prioritises them over you, that you never get to see her, and that this is supposed to be a celebration of you. Then talk to her about whether or not stepfamily is contributing anything because frankly she\u2019s working long hours and cooking and is being bullied by him into doing what he wants. She may need real help and it could be an emotionally abusive relationship. Tell her you want your mother back", "NTA\n\nTell your mother the trip is off. The point was to spend time with her.", "NTA.  You might want to die on this hill since it seems that your mom has missed out on other things with you for his kids.  If anything, they can do Bali together and you and her can do Japan.  It's not like they would be spending time with you two other than meals, so what would be the difference really in going on two trips?  It also sounds like your mom is paying for everything so that is a bit more f-ed up that he's going to pull all this bs reasoning.\n\nPerhaps you should lay out for your mom all the time you've lost out on because of her having to do for his kids instead of you.  Bring up how he says you get all her time, but all her time is spent at work and the rest he hogs when she is not resting from working so much.  He can take his kids to Bali while you two go to Japan.  It's your graduation, not theirs.  If they want to go somewhere when they graduate and keep pushing this, perhaps you can butt in to demand a change of plans to accommodate you.", "NTA. Tell your mom she's breaking her plans with you and letting you down. It's your graduation gift. If she takes it back or changes it into something you don't want, it's no longer a gift, and you don't want it. \n\nIt sounds like she broke her word / promise to you. I hope you tell her you hardly get to spend any one-on-one time with her, and that this is a present you would both be able to look forward to for over a year in anticipation. But she's just going to let her husband crash the plan, steal the vacation away from you, and then basically kick you out of it. I wish she would stand up for you. I mean, her husband can't live without her for just a couple weeks? You can't go on a different family vacation together some other time? It sounds like he's just trying to sabotage the fun time you planned to have with your mother out of some kind of petty jealousy. \n\nI think you should keep pressing this, because there is still plenty of time to fix it. Keep telling her it's all you want. Don't fold to get along. This is important to you, and if you keep letting people treat you like a doormat in order to get along, you'll keep getting treated worse and worse. Stand up for yourself, and insist your mother stand up for you, because this one is a hill worth dying on; If she lets him ruin these plans for you, he'll know he can get away with it every time.", "Or mum could decide to gift OP the money that would have been spent on the Japan trip and then OP can pay for the trip for her and her mum.  Then it's neither parent's money and she can dictate who she spends it on."]}
