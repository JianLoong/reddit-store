We were talking about this during dinner and my step father cuts in and says \u201cOh that would be a nice family holiday\u201d. I never liked my stepfather or his family to begin with so I hated this idea. His children M(15F), R(21M) and B(24M) has always disliked me from since we first met. We were planning to go to Japan for this graduation gift but japan has a lot of walking from place to place and there would be nothing my stepfathers kids would enjoy there as we are planning to go to a lot of anime and Pok\u00e9mon things there in japan. (I\u2019m saying this because none of my stepfathers kids enjoys walking or any sort of anime in general, and whenever we do something they don\u2019t like they always complain about how everything is so boring) So I tried to say how it might be a bad idea seeing as it will be quite expensive for 6 people and seeing as 4 of those will only want to stay in a hotel room and do nothing, I explained it in the nicest way I could trying to get him to see that it would be a bad idea without me telling him I don\u2019t want him or his kids there. So after 5 minutes of me trying to explain why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for him and his kids to go he absolutely blew up at me and starting yelling at me and calling me a selfish brat and how my mother always does everything for me. (My mother always misses out on all of my school reward ceremonies because of his kids, and they\u2019re also always down for the school holidays and any other holiday we have overseas.) His reasoning for him and his kids to come along with us was \u201cit would be great family bonding, plus you always have your mother to yourself\u201d (my mother works 6am-7pm most days so I  never see her if she\u2019s home because she\u2019s normally just cooking dinner and going off to bed just to repeat this almost everyday. And when she finally gets a day off my step father is always doing something with her for most of the day so once again I don\u2019t have anytime to spend with her).\n\nSo aita for me just wanting the holiday to be me and my mother for my graduation present, and not wanting my stepfather or his kids to come?\n\nEdit 1: My mother had a talk to my stepfather about how this was planned that it was just going to be her and I just for a little something for not being there for my past graduations. I overheard him saying \u201cwell it\u2019s unfair that she gets everything she wants and my kids get nothing. Plus you can\u2019t just exclude my kids, they\u2019re your kids as well (adoptive not biological) you make enough money for you to take us all not just your biological daughter.\u201d\n\nMy mother came to talk to me afterwards about what we were now going to do because it was \u201cinconsiderate to his kids and how I wouldn\u2019t like it if they went on a holiday and left me behind\u201d so she suggested for a cheaper option for 6 people such as Bali, so him and his kids could just stay at a resort since they wouldn\u2019t have to do much walking. (Bali was my stepfathers idea because he has always wanted to go to Bali and he and his kids can just stay at the resort and not go anywhere). The problem with this is that, my stepfather doesn\u2019t have custody of me, it\u2019s spilt between my biological father and mother. So unless I\u2019m 18 I most likely won\u2019t be able to go to Bali because of the rules. (Yes im aware that this is in 2 years from now but we were thinking of going in September and I turn 18 in December) \n\nMy mother said that she would talk about it more in the morning but it\u2019s now most likely that we will be going to Bali instead and I most likely won\u2019t be able to come along.

Maybe time to talk to your dad about more time with him and less time with people who are treating you like Cinderella.\n\nEdit: reading back the ages of his kids 2 of them have already had their graduations probably from Uni too and I\u2019m sure had special gifts that were just for them.

But that's a separate issue.\nThis said, I also sense from the rest of your message that there's a fair bit of resentment and maybe even jealousy on your side because you have to share your mom with strangers. And I totally get that, but I also get your stepdad (and probably your mom as well!) wanting you all to bond and get along, even if from your account he was going about it in completely the wrong way.\nImagine for a second the situation was reversed and one of your stepbrothers told your mom \"dad and I are off to the other end of the world for 2 weeks and we don't want you to come\". Don't you think she'd be hurt? Stepdad probably is too.\nI know from where you're standing it sucks, but the family unit is now bigger than just you and mom.

You need to inform her this is no longer a graduation gift, but your stepfather's vacation.

I'd also make it very clear that it is definitely not a graduation gift if she refuses to take your input into account. \n\nIt is also fair to express disappointment because this was something you guys had planned together, and she's going back on it because it doesn't suit your stepfather's tastes", "How is she going on a graduation trip for you, without you?", "NTA but I would just let your mom know that you hope she, step dad and stepkids have fun because you don't want to go.

It hurts me that stepdad's wishes are so important that you haven't even stopped to consider that I may not be able to go on this trip, and trip that is supposed to be about MY graduation. \n\nIf you choose to do this, it will have lasting consequences for our relationship. This is not a threat, it is a statement of fact.

I am not asking you to discard your new family. I am simply asking you, just this once, to choose me and put me first. This is one trip to celebrate an event that will only ever happen once. If you decide to make this trip about stepdad and stepsiblings, if you decide to not only include them but make this a trip for them to the destination they choose, then you will have made it clear that I will never, ever be a priority or even a consideration for you.\"", "NTA. I don\u2019t generally advocate setting down a line in the sand, but this is truly a situation where it is warranted. This is now in no way your graduation trip. It\u2019s your stepfather\u2019s trip that he bullied your mom into agreeing to. You won\u2019t be enjoying yourself, and will only be thinking of the trip that was originally planned for you and your mom. Of course you will have your mom to yourself. This should be as often as you both deem appropriate. Sounds like your stepfather is just jealous.", "Step-dad is controlling & gaslighting. What a combo.", "NTA but your stepdad is awful. And your mom isn\u2019t so great letting you get treated this way. Your mom should think about what your relationship with YOU is going to be like. If I were your mom I would leave this man.", "NTA how did a holiday for the two of you turn into a holiday for him and his kids where you can\u2019t even go?", "NTA. Ask for the money they would put toward your tickets and lodging since you you won\u2019t be able to go because of custody. Use it to move out while they\u2019re gone.", "NTA. As someone who has had almost this exact same situation for the last 10 years for my birthday, just go with your mom. Yeah, him and his kids will be pissed, but once you\u2019re on that trip with your mom it will not matter. You\u2019ll enjoy your time spending it with a parent you don\u2019t get to see much. It\u2019s worth do what you want.", "NTA You deserve to have something of your own that you really want for your graduation gift; it's a once in a lifetime experience. Everyone else 'should' be excluded, biologically related or not. Insist to your mom that you want just this one thing to be about you and her, and how it would mean the world to you, especially since you hardly ever see her.\n\nDon't back down and let your step dad make your dream Japan trip into some cheesey Bali resort vacation that will be mostly for him. Fight tooth and nail for this, it may be your only opportunity to ever do something like this with your mom.", "NTA. Your mom is going to choose your stepdad and his kids over her promise to you?", "NTA\n\nThey need to plan a family trip if that\u2019s what they want.  This is a trip to celebrate YOUR graduation and should be where you want to go.", "NTA\n\nI can't get over the fact that your stepfather has the cheek to say your the selfish brat when he knows it's for YOUR GRADUATION GIFT. The fact that BALI was what he suggested made my blood boil as it wasn't even your gift at that point but his!\n\nMy biggest question why are two adult children being invited? I can understand the 15yo, but a 21yo and 24yo? Did he expect everyone was gonna get a ticket and a hotel room to fit 6 people? What fantasy did he live in?\n\nIf it was a money issue they could help with the cost the two adult children should be working or at least have some part time work to save money. So again...You're not the AH but the stepfather is by pulling such a power move to get his way.\n\nHe can screw off and his children can screw off.  The point of travel is to explore not sit in a hotel room all day! There is a lot of fun things in Japan and I see it as a waste to bring them if all they're gonna do is sit in a room or freaking complain like come on!\n\nOkay I'm done....sorry for the rant.", "NTA.  Talk to your mom about how important this trip is for just the 2 of you to go and make memories.   Let stepdad take his kids to Bali and you and mom go to Japan. Refuse to go on a family trip. This is your graduation gift and step family should not be allowed to high jack it", "NTA. You have valid reasons for not wanting your step siblings to tag along on your mother's graduation gift to you. I hope that it is your mother's money, because that would especially validate your stepfather not going. If it is,he has absolutely no right to insist that he and his kids come along. This is your graduation present from your mother. His kids have nothing to do with it. It sounds like you tried to be diplomatic about it,trying to tell him you just wanted it to be you and your mom. If he wants a family bonding trip,then he can plan one when it's not your graduation.", "NTA. Let them go to Japan and he can take his kids to do whatever while you and mom do what you want. But also, when those kids graduate, no matter how old you are, insist that you are going and why they need to change locations and use his exact wording as to why every time. (im just that petty)", "NTA\n\nIf you can't go on your intended trip for YOUR graduation, then YOU get to pick the destination of the trip you will now get that your being forced to include everyone else... and that's not Bali. If your mothers husband wants a family holiday to Bali, that only benefits him and his kids (and I would 100% tell your mum that) then HE should be the one footing the bill, or do you get to choose what everyone does when his youngest graduates to make it even.\n\nI would stand my ground. This trip isn't about them. Its about you and your mum. Everything you've wrote here you need to tell her. You don't spend any time together, he takes up her days off, she puts his kids stuff over yours, she may have adopted them, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have 1on1 time with your own mother.", "Show your mom this thread. He\u2019s bullying her into getting his dream trip. See if your dad can go to Japan and have mom pay for your half and not tell step dad.", "Nta. But understand your mom is stuck between a rock and a hard place here too.\n\nAlso is your stepdad footing any of the bill for any of these trips? Because that\u2019s an important detail too", "NTA\n\nSeriously no one is going to talk about the fact that the \"kids\" in this story are GROWN ADULTS(except one). OP is 16 and the step father claims she shouldn't go on a trip because his 21 YEAR OLD and 24 YEAR OLD might feel bad.", "NTA\n\nSeriously no one is going to talk about the fact that the \"kids\" in this story are GROWN ADULTS(except one). OP is 16 and the step father claims she shouldn't go on a trip because his 21 YEAR OLD and 24 YEAR OLD might feel bad.", "NTA\n\nThis is a crummy situation and your stepfather is being a dick. \n\nPlenty of families in both blended and non-blended scenarios do a 1:1 trip after graduation. It's a specific reason for the trip, not a family trip. \n\nI hope this works out for you.", "NTA. But the blowback was inevitable if you were talking about it at family dinner.", "NTA\n\nIt was your graduation trip. Now, it is just mom\u2019s make the new family happy trip. A gift to celebrate you now has zero to do with you.\n\nCould your dad take you on your special trip and mom can just do whatever she wants with her family?", "NTA\n\nSeriously no one is going to talk about the fact that the \"kids\" in this story are GROWN ADULTS(except one). OP is 16 and the step father claims she shouldn't go on a trip because his 21 YEAR OLD and 24 YEAR OLD might feel bad.", "Oh those edits broke my heart. NTA", "OP, I would text your mom, \"I am incredibly hurt that instead of a trip for you and me to bond, my graduation trip is turning into a 'family' trip with people who don't like me. You asked if I would be upset if my stepfather and his kids took a trip without me. The answer is no, I wouldn't mind. And they should mind if we go on this trip together. This will probably be our last chance to spend this amount of time together before I go out into the real world. \n\nI can't make you do anything you don't want to do, but please don't call it my graduation trip if it's not where I want to go, or with people I want to go with. Call it yet another example of why I don't feel seen or heard in this household. And please don't act shocked in the future when this is a hurtful moment I never forget. A moment I pinpoint as having a significant impact on our relationship.\n\nWith all of that said, don't come back and speak to me and try to guilt-trip me. I'm not going to change my mind about how I feel.\"\n\nAnd, OP, if she does change this trip because she was bullied by your stepdad, go LC with all of them when you move away. Also, get into therapy. It's not easy to live in a family like yours.", "He's calling OP a selfish brat when he's demanding a free trip for himself and his kids and throwing a tantrum. It's insane.", "Stepdad isn't just bulldozing his way onto the trip, he's bulldozing his way into changing the destination.\n\nI doubt he cares at all that it's supposed to be a trip to celebrate OP. He just sees it as a trip that he can take control of and do what he pleases.", "Yes.  A trip to Bali is *not* a present to you.  It's a present for your stepfather, and you're allowed to tag along.\n\nThis is not something you want or need.   Tell your mother that.", "I like how you think."]}
