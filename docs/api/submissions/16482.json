Ultimately you will not be able to watch him every hour of every day, so this won't be an effective solution unless you get buy in from him. In the long run, he will need to be internally motivated to wear the retainer. \n\nWhen our daughter was 9 she needed some insane headgear to reposition her jaw which required her wearing this chunk of metal and plastic on her face 24/7 for the better part of a year. Before we went ahead with it, we talked about her options (major surgery as an adult or headgear as a child) and what we could do to help make the process easier for her. She bought into the process and faithfully wore that crazy thing all the time. Her classmates ended up respecting her for what she was willing to do, and she never once got teased!\n\nYou set a consequence, and followed through on the consequence. But ultimately you will probably lose this battle if that's the only tool you have.\n\nedit:typo", "NTA. \n\nThe amount of money you've spent getting his teeth straight is no joke. You've told him dozens of times and is not listening. A grounding makes sense to me. \n\nTo the people saying you should sit him down and explain the importance of wearing it, yes, you should. But also a kid isn't going to listen to reason. They're kids, impulsive and kind of dumb when it comes to doing what's good for them.", "INFO\n\nHow old is he? Would he rather deal with crooked teeth than have the retainer? Is there any medical reason for the retainers or is it purely for a cosmetic issue? Have you talked with his orthodontist about the option to do overnight retainers or finding another alternative?", "NTA.  You paid A LOT of money to get his teeth straight!  He can wear a retainer just like other kids wear glasses.", "NTA, \n\nIt makes sense why he doesn\u2019t want to wear them and is common that kids don\u2019t, but he\u2019ll be glad he did in a couple years. Idk if it\u2019s necessarily something that warrants a punishment but being grounded for 2 days isn\u2019t going to kill him and he\u2019ll probably be more careful about wearing them at home.", "How is grounding him helping? I'm not sure I understand. I'm not calling you AH, but I genuinely don't understand how this will help?", "NAH. You\u2019re trying to make him wear his retainer, and you set rules, but your son isn\u2019t following them, so, since you would rather he wear them than punish him, it would be great to work with him. \u201cWhat would make you wear your retainer consistently?\u201d Maybe it would be worth a reward? Something that you could fairly take back from him if he didn\u2019t comply?", "INFO: Does grounding him work?  Does it make him wear his retainers?", "NTA. You can tell him til the cows come home why he has to wear them and what will happen if he won\u2019t but with kids it\u2019s always in one ear and out the other. Kid has got to learn one way or another.", "NTA\n\n The front 4 teeth in my lower jaw wishes my parents had done this with me. \n\nYou're rescuing him from a lifetime of embarrassment and judgement.", "As someone who has to wear a retainer every night for the rest of my life NTA. I had an imbedded tooth that didn\u2019t come through so I had ti have that removed. As a result I have a gap and I have to wear a retainer to maintain that gap so I can wear a false tooth. Your son may hate it now but it will be worth it", "INFO, how old is he? I had braces and threw my retainer away when I got my braces off. I had them on for 7 years which was torture, i was NOT about to continue the torture with a retainer. If he\u2019s old enough (teenager, 16/17) to understand the consequences of it, why keep pushing? He\u2019s never going to listen.", "Idk honestly. I had the upper hawley retainer and it sucked. You can\u2019t talk right. I have an awful memory from highschool where I got called on and had to remove my retainer in front of the whole class because I literally could not speak when it was in. It was extremely embarrassing. I would discuss with his Ortho if there is a different upper retainer he can use similar to invisiline that doesn\u2019t affect his speech. I stopped wearing my upper hawley retainer and my teeth have not moved because I wear my bottom retainer so my bite stays in place since the bottom teeth don\u2019t move. I think you need to do more digging as to why exactly he\u2019s having trouble. He could be experiencing some difficulties you don\u2019t know about.", "I think grounding your son for not wearing his retainers is a little much. \n\nYTA - Personally, what I\u2019d do is advise your son the reason why he needs to wear them, explain what can happen, stress how much he needs to wear them and even go as far to say you\u2019re worried about him not wearing them. He\u2019s a kid, he might be embarrassed by the fact he wears them at school, I get it.", "NTA.\n\nHe isn't wearing it because they're awkward and embarrassing.  Not rocket science.  Telling him why it's important (and probably not the first time someone would be doing so) isn't going to make him realize it's super cool and start wearing it.  Not sure what world all the Y T A voters are living in where all a teenager needs is a conversation to get them to start doing things they don't want to do.", "Irrespective of any judgement, grounding doesn\u2019t work. So you are alienating your kid without actual benefit.\n\nTangentially relevant: I discovered (the hard way) that wearing retainers before the wisdom teeth have erupted is pointless. After the wisdom teeth grow, they completely rearrange the bite, and one has to go through the pain (and expense) of wearing retainers once again.", "NTA.  It's called parenting.", "Soft YTA. I think you\u2019re doing this because ultimately you care about him and when he\u2019s older he\u2019ll probably actually appreciate it / regret not keeping them on. BUT, grounding him for a weekend is a bit much. Have you checked in with him as to why he doesn\u2019t like wearing them? It could well be a reason - worth taking a trip to the orthodontist with him rather than punishing him.", "NTA\n\nYou mentioned what you were gonna do multiple times but he still did not follow directions. This was a tough but reasonable punishment for him to hopefully learn about consequences. Good parenting OP.", "I\u2019m gonna say soft YTA, because you probably spent lots of money on his teeth but there are other ways to handle this. \n\nHave you explained in detail to your son why it\u2019s important he wears them? Have you sat him down and asked him why he clearly doesn\u2019t like to wear them?", "Nah but Honestly natural consequences might be the way too go. I was just like your son and after a while my parents said fine but I\u2019d have too deal with the consequences of not wearing my retainer. I ended up with crooked teeth in my teens again and I had to get a job to pay to get them straightened again\u2026 I leaned real quick the value of money and why it\u2019s important to take care of yourself.", "YTA how old is he? If he\u2019s capable of understanding that what not wearing his retainers will cause, that\u2019s his decision. Punishment is most likely going to make him hate them more. \n\nIf he is forgetting, punishing him isn\u2019t going to help. He needs better tools to remember to use them. If they are causing abnormal discomfort, they need adjusted - punishment isn\u2019t going to help that. \n\nIf he\u2019s young and just doesn\u2019t like them - punishment isn\u2019t going to help. Positive reinforcement will though.\n\n Have you talked to him about this and found what the barriers are?", "That's called parenting; some call it tough love. Either way, I appreciate the effort required.", "YTA. You know those things hurt  - right? How about you try advil before you ground him?", "NTA If he doesn't wear his retainers his teeth will shift back and he would require wearing braces again, wasting the money and discomfort already invested. Your son is being an ungrateful, irresponsible dumbass. He can have privileges restored when he adjusts his behavior.", "NTA.  Braces are expensive enough without teeth continuing to move after the fact.  And that's exactly what will happen if he doesn't wear the retainers.  Sure, they don't look cool, but I'm sure he's not the only adolescent at his school wearing them.", "VERY SOFT YTA.

It seems very harsh to ground him.

But hawley retainers suck - they are annoying to wear, uncomfortable, ugly, kinda gross, and worst of all they make you talk with a lisp because of how much space they take up in your mouth. Could you ask him if he\u2019d be more likely to wear retainers if they were Invisalign style? That\u2019s the kind of retainers I got as a kid when my braces were removed. They are much better IMO", "This is why I'm not a human kid parent. If i spent thousands on my kids mouth and they couldn't wear their retainers,  I'd be withholding allowance or taking my monies back from their college fund. That's not the way though but the orthodontist won't give me a refund so I'd get it back somehow", "I agree with this. I had fixed braces for 18 months then got a retainer. I barely used it. It was my mistake and it haunted me upon adulthood. Probably different because in the US you pay for them?", "Agreed, I stopped wearing my retainers because they gave me horrible lockjaw, I never would have had the braces if I had known that retainers were forever.

I had a serious overbite and could fit a nickel between my two front teeth. I started wearing it only at bedtime. It was in there solid and I was mostly still. I didn\u2019t have to take it out at lunch or mess with it all during the day. It didn\u2019t  take much longer than than the dentist and manufacturers estimated time. I went for my adjustments normally.. I kept a small gap, no coins fit , same as my Dads gap , 2 of 3 sons and  several grandchildren.  I\u2019m 54 and got my first cavity a year ago.

Your daughter has my respect too.", "Yeah, teeth arent ever really \"set\" the way folks were told 20+ years ago.\n\nMost adults I know now (30s) who wore braces had to either get braces again or get retainers to wear to keep teeth from shifting.\n\nAt this point i dont knoelw if a dentist could convince me of any benefit to childhood braces unless there was major comfort (or self confidence) issues. All that money for very little benefit would be a hard sell.\n\nI watched my partner go through the whole process in their early 30s, with some being covered by our insurance. The pain, time, PITA, and cost was not insubstantial. My partner was told they should have gotten braces as a kid, they just didnt have parents who gave a shit - there was money, but not for my partner. :/\n\nIf this kid were mine Id sit down and have a talk with them. If they didnt want braces or a retainer then ok, but that means your teeth stay as they are or go back to how they were. A natural consequence. If they decide their on board then its up to them to use the retainer. If they \"forget\" then the parents will \"forget\" to pay for more. Another natural consequence.\n\nBut for something thats so often cosmetic that affects only them, I really dont think I could justify grounding the kid. TBH.", "If the other option was simply pulling a couple teeth, we'd probably have gone with that. But the alternative was ongoing pain and likely broken or damaged teeth followed by surgical resetting of the jaw including some months with it wired shut.", "My mom had me get braces when I was around 14 and they came off at 16. I didn\u2019t do the best job at wearing my retainers, so my teeth moved back. Which means I now have to get braces again at 30, and I\u2019m on the hook for the whole bill (which is fine - my fault, my bill). When I called my mom to tell her that I needed braces again, she was less than thrilled. We started at \u201cwhat is wrong with you?\u201d and made our way all the way down to several curse words and a completely justified guilt trip about how much money she spent on them.", "The plan from the start should be to remove the wisdom teeth before they have erupted and have any effect on the alignment of the rest of the teeth.", "Exactly! Seems like teenagers wear braces for little to no positive effect! (Which is congruent with the fact that more than a quarter of orthodontic patients in US/Canada are adults.)\n\nHowever, I think that nowadays the orthodontic practice changed, as in, the braces are designed not to rearrange the teeth - but to widen the jaw (so it can accommodate the teeth). So *nowadays* it is probably beneficial for teenagers to wear braces (even before wisdom teeth eruption). \u2026 Which essentially means I just disproved my own argument against the OP. :-)", "To be fair, as someone who was forced against my will to have braces (purely cosmetic, I was not embarrassed about my teeth, it was a tiny gap between my front two top teeth.

The only reason I toughed it out is because in response to my fighting tooth and nail, my mother finally agreed to get me a milk shake after every tightening (once a month) because she knew it would hurt and I had previous trauma with my mouth (bowling ball to the face and chipped my teeth because another kid wanted to know if it would hurt but didn't want to test it on himself). What she did not count on was that even taking pain meds for it, I was still in so much pain I was hyperventilating from crying, couldn't eat anything except soft foods for up to 3 days at my worst points, and the infections on the top of my mouth always seemed to happen on Fridays nights, and they were closed for the weekends. My orthodontist thought I was purely overreacting, so he would not prescribe pain meds, but finally totally removed my plate because my mom FINALLY called him out on something.

My teeth were moving back even as I was wearing my retainers as directed, literally causing grooves and weird angles again. My current dentist, who is very good, said it\u2019s because my mouth is on the small side, and because I had braces before I got my wisdom teeth out, there simply wasn\u2019t room for my teeth to stay in place.

I had crowded teeth and the orthodontist needed the space to finish straightening them.", "Fascinating. For years I felt like a failure because my teeth moved back after braces...I mean, I guess that was mostly on me, b/c of not wearing the retainer, but maybe it would have anyway, because I got wisdom teeth out a few years later. I recently got braces put on, and I'm realizing that many adults get them (or Invisalign)...and many of those folks are doing straightening for the second time.
