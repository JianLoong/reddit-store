There are no other electrical issues in the house, just this one light.\n\nAnywho recently my younger brother 'john' asked to stay at mine while I was away for a few days to get some space from the 5 other people he rents with. I said sure, no worries. \n\nThe first night he's there he notices the bedroom light is out, I explain the situation and he decides to put a message in the family chat taking the piss out of me for not knowing how to look after my own place and sort shit out. My other 2 brothers and dad start laying into me for being negligent and not telling them so they could organise an electrician for me. \n\nI simply sent back 'john talk to me about homeownership when you aren't living in a six person share house with no way of buying your own place anytime soon'. \n\nEveryone is now calling me an asshole because John has been trying really hard to work and save so he can get his own place and now I feel pretty guilty.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676199579, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110d5zl/aita_for_shaming_my_brother_for_renting/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He completely overstepped boundaries. You were kind enough to let him stay at your home while away, so he could have some alone time; some peace. He should have minded his own business. Unless he could help you. But it should have been between YOU and him...Not the whole freaking family. That is crossing a boundary line.   \n\n\nThen your brothers and dad \"starting laying into you for being negligent and not telling them\"??? DUDE! You're 32 freaking years old! You're a big girl, an adult. You don't owe them any explanation or update on your house. If you want an electrician, you can get one yourself or you can ask them and then they can give you suggestions. But wth??? It sounds like your family really struggles with respecting your personal boundaries. And that's not okay.   \n\n\nGood for you for giving him his own shit back to him, I say!", "You should get that wiring checked out. House fires can start from bad wiring.", "NTA. What he did was completely unnecessary. You were good enough to let him stay with you then he thought it was a good idea to belittle you for the entertainment of your relatives.", "Jesus. ESH. Your family dynamic sounds mean and stressful.", "ESH. You *should* have got the light at least checked out as it could be a wiring issue, which can be dangerous. He shouldn\u2019t have laughed at you on the family group chat. You shouldn\u2019t have made it about home ownership vs. renting.", "You both are assholes, really.", "NTA. you got your lick back. your family sounds heavily misogynistic if i\u2019m honest, and john is probably jealous that his sister lives better than him. you offered him a place to stay just for him to throw it in your face.", "I know it shouldn\u2019t have but this made me laugh. Your brother was being an AH trying to shame you when you have been kind enough to let him stay at your house. Your reponse was perfect but mean, so a little bit of an A H move though I totally get why.", "NTA\n\nBut for Fks sake, don't try and fix electrical issues yourself.\n\nIf it's just a switch on the fusebox, then fine, reset it and see what happens, (though if it's just one light, that's unlikely to be the case. I'd be surprised if they had one light on a whole circuit).\n\nIf it's not working because of a short or water, you need an electrician to fix it, and soon, otherwise you could get zapped or get your house burned down.\n\nA couple of hundred to run new infinity cable is cheaper than a couple of hundred thousand (at best) to rebuild.", "Gently, ESH. But your brother more than you.\n\nI don't really blame you because I'd have been pissed enough to clapback like that too. You were doing him a favor and how does he thank you? By belittling you in the family group chat and opening you up to criticism from your misogynistic father. If he was concerned, he should have talked to you, not publicly shamed you. That was a huge AH move and he majorly sucks for it. If it were my brother, I'd refuse to let him stay with me again until he made it up to me. \n\nBut at the same time... shaming him for being stuck renting a shitty place, essentially the same situation you were in not so long ago, was a crappy thing to do. One bad turn doesn't deserve another, and that was a low blow. So you also suck a little for that. \n\nAlso a side note - do try and get an electrician to take a look at that light when you can. It could be indicative of a larger wiring problem, which is seriously not something you want to mess around with.", "ESH Wasn't his place to say anything and definitely wasn't nice but comparatively fixing a light is a lot easier then buying a house especially these days. Well done on one upping him.", "NTA\n\nMaybe other than home maintenance stuff, John should learn to not stick his nose where it doesn't belong.", "Honestly, NTA. You didn't say this unprompted. Your family sounds incredibly toxic tbh.", "Eh, you two are even now so I guess ESH? BUT I would encourage you to get that electrician. Loss of power can mean a few different things, some potentially serious.", "NTA, you did him a favour and he went and badmouthed you for something that isn\u2019t his business in front of your family. Them taking his side fits because your father is a sexist AH anyway.", "ESH\n\n>with no way of buying your own place anytime soon'.\n\nThat was just mean, especially in this economy. \n\nBut your brother talking shit about you while staying in your house was equally an AH thing to do.\n\nYou both took jabs at each other. If you feel guilty,  apologize and talk it out.", "NTA, first of all, lamps are superior. Second, he should learn to be nicer", "ESH\n\nYour response was totally justified, yet equally assholish as your family\u2019s behavior.", "NTA- your father and brothers are sexist AHs. As for the brother you were doing a favour for, what a snake. \nNot to mention, you're 32, you're a grown woman  and you can decide how and when to deal with issues in your house. \nYou have a bedside lamp and you're happy with this solution. I'm sure you're able to pick up the phone and call an electrician if you want one. \n\nYou might have been a little harsh but 4 guys picking on the useless daughter/sister?\nI would have done the same.", "NTA. You can't ask someone for a favour and take the mickey. He could have been polite and asked if you needed help in finding someone to fix your light. Therefore your comment is fair game.", "NTA, but please get a sparky to come and look at the wiring for that light. It\u2019s a potential fire hazard.", "NTA and that was a great comeback.  He was staying at your place for free, then dumps on you because of one &$@\\* light?? And gets everyone else in the family to dump on you too? Guess he won\u2019t be getting any more free nights at your place.", "ESH, him and your family shouldn't have said that but neither should you. Also did you figure out what is causing the issue or just that it wasn't a faulty bulb? I'd worry that it could lead to something dangerous if it's something more serious.", "I feel like this is the epitome of not throwing stones when you live in a glass house. Your brother forgot that his glass house has six other people in it lol", "NTA\n\nDon't start nothing, then there won't be nothing. He got what he deserved and I would question doing him a solid in the future if he runs his mouth off about stuff that doesn't concern him.", "NTA. If you\u2019re going to act like a chinese spy balloon you\u2019re going to get shot down.", "ESH. He shouldn\u2019t have jabbed at you in the first place, but he\u2019s literally saving up to get his own place. You demeaning him for doing so is revolting and an overreaction.", "NTA\n\nHe mocked what he thought was your incapacity to do something and used it as a punchline to invite other people to mock you as well; as a result he was mocked for his incapacity to do something\u2014OH, when it's him on the receiving end, it's not so funny? Sorry, didn't get the memo about that. Tough. Lesson learned for ingrate John!", "NTA! Just like you said, \u201cJohn\u201d shouldn\u2019t have used you as a joke in the family chat. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard he\u2019s working, he started with the so-called jokes, so OP joined in. \n\nAnd- I hardly ever use the ceiling lights in our house. I much prefer the ambiance of lamps.", "NTA", "ESH. Hire an electrician, that's your responsibility as an owner.", "NTA. Don't dish it out if you can't handle it. He should be grateful you're letting him spend a couple of days there. Maybe next time instead of talking shit he can ask you, hey sis is there anything you need me to do while I'm gone. I'm sure he learn he lesson.", "ESH. He shouldn't make fun of you when you graciously let him stay there, and certainly not to your whole family and especially not about an issue that could be dangerous (IMO an electrician would be a good idea, just to make sure nothing dangerous is going on) so that was poorly handled on his part. If it was out of concern he could have just expressed worry without mockery, and to you first instead of going into the group. If you said no THEN maybe appeal to the family to talk to you. \n\nBut you didn't have to hit him where it hurts. Could have just set him straight about making fun of you and going to the family before talking to you without putting him down for renting. We don't all run the same race and if someone's trying to better their situation that's mean to put them down.", "You don't get to take the high road after throwing out insults. Talk about a weak mindset. NTA\n\nFunny how to ones that act the most macho are the first to break down crying when they get insulted", "Maybe you don't have to shame your brother for renting, but you could remind him that it's important to prioritize saving and investing in a home of his own. Renting can be an important way to gain financial stability and save up to buy a house someday.", "NTA. Low blow? Yes. But it sounds like they were ganging up on you which is not appropriate, especially as you were doing him a favour.\n\nOn a serious note, however, please get it checked out because it could be damaging other parts of the circuit it is in which may lead to overload or electrical fires. \n\nSeveral people have suggested this and you are responding that you don\u2019t touch electrics. This is absolutely good practice for a non professional but you are missing their point that you need to investigate and solve the electrical issue by calling in an electrician before something happens. Keep using your lamp, but you should get the problem sorted out.", "[deleted]", "YTA.  But only because you are confused, ironically.  Conventional wisdom says you should own your home as rent is just throwing money away.  But if you look at the numbers, having a mortgage is throwing a shitload of money away...especially compared to renting.   By the time your mortgage is settled, you have paid for your house 3 or 4 times the buying price.   If you can buy a home without a mortgage, it's still not necessarily a good idea.  For example, a new roof can cost up to $50,000 and the roof will only last about 20 or 30 years depending on the roofing material and the weather in your area.  And that's not counting the thousands of minor maintenance items that will nickel and dime you to death.  Stuff that your landlord would have to worry about, if you were renting.\n\nSmarter people these days are renting.  And they only buy if it's an income-producing property.\n\nSo why are you the AH?  For pressuring John to do something that is not a good idea for John.", "NTA, it was mean but don\u2019t start things you can\u2019t finish.\nYou should get an electrician to look at that though, or learn to fix yourself electricity isn\u2019t a thing to fear if you take the proper precautions.", "NTA", "Love your reply, NTA.", "people confuse the rating system in this subreddit for \"if you do anything I don't agree, you're TA\"\n\nOP should get their writing checked.

Instead.. he opted to try to embarrass you.", "ESH. Your brother and family are obviously the bigger AHs. I can understand where your response came from with a family like that, your brother asked to stay with you and you were nice enough to let him. If he thought you needed an electrician he could have gone about telling you in a much nicer way. His comments came from shaming you rather than concern and thats an AH move. Your mentality of thinking you're better than other people because you own property however is a very toxic mentality. It sounds like you need to have a discussion with your family about how they act and set bounderies, if they aren't followed it seems like you might need to have some distance from them. Seems like a dynamic that won't end well unless dealt with in an appropriate way and you shouldn't have to deal with feeling disrespected by your family because of your gender all the time.", "ESH\n\nYour brother and family for the 'females are incompetent' 'jokes' your whole life.\n\nYou for responding to that small joke with a large one.\n\nYou have your own, you only need to let them in as much as you desire. \n\nIf you let them in enforce your boundary, get them to understand you don't find it funny. Use tactics like tell the joke again, I don't get it. So they end up having to say it's funny because sexism. \n\nOr understand that bro makes fun of you. But they find you an electrician. That's the trade, your family is annoying while helpful. \n\nBut pick.", "ESH, he was a dick first, but your reply was unnecessarily petty and also didn't really make sense.

I know where my safety switch is and can change a bulb and that's it.", ">I'm sure you're able to pick up the phone and call an electrician if you want one. \n\nAnd that's where it goes to ESH category.  Calling an electrician isn't something she can do at at her discretion - she needed to call one once she noticed the problem.  She needs to call one.  The fact that the light isn't turning on doesn't mean there's not activity in the wires.  Nearly half of house fires are caused by faulty wiring, and the issue is above her bed.  Not safe.", "[removed]", "Right? Like...OP, you really should look into hiring an electrician because it could either be something minor or something that could burn your house down suddenly in the middle of the night, and you don't know which. You're literally gambling on your life and continued home ownership.", "I hate that this is the lore we live with now", "Um i think thats exactly what hes trying to di by living with 5 other people lmao", "Where is the joke though? He 'takes the piss' which is often a code for bullying banter that when taken the wrong way, gets turned back on recipient who then gets called 'sensitive'.\nThe other 3 were laying into her and having a go for her not telling them so that they could send an electrician to her home... she's 32! Why does she gets told off by 3 men about something that is none of their business. It's sexist and demeaning, not funny. \nNo wonder she snapped.", "That will happen after 32 years of jokes where the punchline is basically 'hur der females are incompetent'.", "I don't think that was really the dig. John made fun of her for not \"properly\" maintaining her house, she made fun of him for not being able to get one, when he really wants one.\n\nThe economy stuff (even if it's true), has little regard for that matter. Basically the whole family dynamic sounds like butt.", "People purchase their own homes to lock in their costs of living. Renting makes you be subjected to market conditions while having a mortgage with a 30 year locked in rate doesn't. It's mostly just about the housing security a mortgage provides and the ability to better plan for future expenses.", "Except rent in some places has payments very close or higher to mortgage repayments, but you also don't end up with an asset that can be sold.\n\nPlus ya know moving every year because the landlords keep jacking up prices or refusing to repair the hot water system sucks", "Not harsh enough.", "Maybe if John had kept his AH mouth shut then the OP wouldn't have retaliated. Don't dish it out if you can't take it.", "That's not what chauvinist means:\n\na person displaying excessive or\u00a0prejudiced\u00a0support for their own cause or group, in particular a man prejudiced against women.\n\n\"she now reports to a new boss, who is a chauvinist\"\n\nYou're thinking of xenophobia.", ">Chauvinist \n\n(noun) a person displaying excessive or prejudiced support for their own cause or group, in particular a man prejudiced against women.", "No one helpped me with a deposit. \n\nScrimped, saved, as I said lived in shitty sharehouse rentals through my 20's. The place I bought isn't exactly a mansion, it's a townhouse in a small complex.", "Preach", "Yup, first thing we did in our house was replace all the wiring. Good thing too since several parts were damaged to the core or had screws in them.. \n\nFaulty electricity is a big cause of house fires.", "Brother was a dick about it, but not wrong.  Assuming the issue is not a problem and limited to the one light box is not a safe and prudent approach.  OP may not be T A, but it's certainly an ESH situation.", "Not checking wires can cause fires. They neglected this fact and it could put many people living around that area into risk. Even if they couldn't do it themselves, they should have called an electrician or someone. Emphases on the 'should'. Also, OP was equally disrespectful to their brother by shaming him by saying, \"*I simply sent back 'john talk to me about homeownership when you aren't living in a six person share house with no way of buying your own place anytime soon'.*\"", "Just as a concerned human maybe you should have an electrician look at it to be safe. I don't know squat about electrical but an electrical fire is one of my worst fears. Just a thought.
