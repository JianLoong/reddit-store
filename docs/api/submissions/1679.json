Quote:\n\n> I gently tried to ask if maybe he just thinks that no one should talk to high school friends because he didn\u2019t really have any friends in high school and was socially maladjusted, so people having friends from high school makes him jealous or something.\n\nThis leading 'I'm just asking questions' bullshit is the problem.\n\n\"Hey, why do you rag on anything high school related?\" is a question.\n\n\"Hey, I won't associate with people who talk shit behind other people's backs\" is a boundary.\n\n\"Hey, do you think maybe you're socially maladjusted and jealous\" is an insult.", "He reduced a perfectly nice, friendly, intelligent girl down to her looks due to his trauma. Being a victim is not at all an excuse to not firmly address maladapted behavior just as the OP did. Yes, it\u2019s unfair that through no fault of their own they may have been bullied. Absolutely doesn\u2019t mean that he gets to be met with patience and therapy levels of consideration when he\u2019s actively bullying someone himself.", "NTA OP....\n\nBut this dude probably had a terrible experience in HS. \n\nAsk him if he needs help, or would like someone to talk to about it?\n\nIMO it sounds like the brink of being unstable.", "NTA\n\nGuy needs therapy. Try and stage an intervention.", "NTA\n\nThis fixation of theirs is leaking out into other aspects of their life. For every person who can't get over the \"glory days\" of high school, there's a socially awkward person who can't get over the \"miserable days\" of high school, it seems. Neither one of these scenarios is emotionally healthy.", "NTA. This dude sounds toxic", "NTA but just don\u2019t bother with this guy. He likely had a horrible high school experience and can\u2019t let it go.", "Lordy. I was a grade-A (pun intended) weirdo in high school, not popular, and I still talk to people I know from then. He is bitter and the one letting high school define the rest of his life. NTA.", "Sounds a little incel-y, from my initial read of this. You\u2019re definitely NTA, but I think \u2014for your own safety\u2014 that distancing yourself from him would be good. There\u2019s something a little off kilter and his online friendships are further radicalizing him.", "Gonna go with ESH sorry. By your post I'm guessing he's not a friend of yours in anyway and is just a classmate in your general vicinity during the study group so besides not being gentle with delivery, your comments are just as uncalled for as his. I get why you did it, dude was annoying, I just don't see it as any better than him. Also, your experience isn't universal; in college most of the people I knew barely kept contact with the people they knew from HS. Besides my best friend, I haven't even seen most of my friends back then, and if his comments are so often to be annoying, then you guys also are going on about HS friends and teachers and that's just weird for a study group. \nJust tell the guy that if he can't keep his comments to himself he should just leave as soon as the study part is done or find another group if he finds you all so annoying.", "Some of us went to high schools so big that social groups didn\u2019t matter because there were way too many people to know who was popular and who wasn\u2019t.", "LOL.  There was, and I edited it right out!  I need another cup of coffee to see if I can recall what it was!", "I deleted parts and rewrote and I guess I wrote point b out of there!  Of course, I can't remember what it was, now!  LOL", "Or maybe, just maybe, he is a social oddball.  Because his reactions to his poor treatment in HS, if he did suffer such trauma, is inappropriate.  He belittles anyone who seems to have any friendships or ties with people they knew in school.  He calls them losers, tells them they are pathetic, insults them, etc.  THAT has nothing to do with his own lack of trust!  People who have misplaced and volatile anger towards others, as this guy has.....are often the first thing people recall about them when they unleash their displeasure in a far more destructive way.  Think Columbine shooters or Sandy Hook or other horrific tragedies.  People will recall the loners, the ones who hated those that they perceived as being their \"tormentors\", people they wanted to get back at.  Whatever is going on with this guy, his behaviors are anything BUT rational or normal.  Which is why I advised this OP to not engage with him and try to reason with him.  He may be totally harmless, but he is not displaying typical behaviors of someone just having had a tough time during school years, either.  There is something off with him, and I won't sugarcoat my words.", "The answer isn\u2019t for her to bulky back.", "OP didn't call him a loser, he called himself a loser. You're putting words into the equation that weren't said in the post, like Butt Hurt Cologne dude did when he put words in OP's mouth. Doesn't help the situation at all.", "She didn\u2019t \u201cbulky\u201d him back though? OP mentioned that he was a social outcast. That\u2019s not bullying. That\u2019s pointing out the obvious.", "OP's submission says:\n\n> I gently tried to ask if maybe he just thinks that no one should talk to high school friends because he didn\u2019t really have any friends in high school and was socially maladjusted, so people having friends from high school makes him jealous or something.\n\nSounds like a very wordy way of saying 'loser with no friends' to me.", "Sounds like you have a way of perceiving things to have a negative connotation. I was that awkward kid in school, who was socially maladjusted and kind of weird. But when my friends/old high-school classmates and I talk about those days and they point that out, I don't immediately perceive them as calling me a \"loser with no friends\". I perceive them as calling me \"socially awkward and weird\" because that's exactly what I was. I peaked right after high-school and into college but not once would I label myself as a \"loser\", nor has anyone else labeled me or made me think they were labeling me as such either. Just because someone is using big wordy-words, doesn't mean they're outright insulting someone.", "It's a study group? Like, I'm guessing if just not hanging with him was an option, they would. But study groups can be run and organized by TAs, so it's possible they can't just boot Butt Hurt Cologne from the group.\n\nAnd yes, I agree that you're probably struggling to understand how that trope is relevant to your opinion.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he hasn't gotten over high school. It lives on in his mind rent free, years later.", "I mean that wasn\u2019t a very nice thing to say, but you definitely aren\u2019t wrong.  So I\u2019m going to say Nta, but again they should have a justified asshole option.", "Rancid incel vibes. NTA, what a weirdo. \n\nSigned, someone who had no lasting friends from high school OR college (except my spouse). Why not just be happy for folks who have good memories and lasting friendships?", "NTA .question does this guy also refer to women as foids and does he talk about Chads alot ? You know why i am asking.", "NTA, He shouldn't be acting this way towards other people, but maybe he was bullied heavily in high school and that's why he's responding this way? It definitely sounds like he has some unresolved issues.", "NTA Maybe you were a bit blunt to him but he was being an AH in what he said about the girl from your study group.  \n\nI suspect he was social outcast at school, because he was so miserable and unpleasant - and being a social outcast made him more miserable and more unpleasant.  And that trend is likely to continue unless he gets himself some help.", "NTA. Tbf high school sucks for a lot of people, but he is going to have learn it's not ok to shit on people who enjoyed hs or at least have positive memories of that time.", "Steer clear of this guy\u2014he sounds like he is overly invested in his high school grievances and could come unglued.", "NTA. It\u2019s giving incel", "He probably was friendless and bullied and never got over it.  So he has resentment towards anyone with a happy connection.", "~~was~~ **is** socially maladjusted\n\nFixed that for you OP.", "Very well said.", "Oh he absolutely does.", "Hey, it gave us the perfect opportunity to lighten the tone of this thread. \ud83d\ude09\n\nEdit to correct a typo", "But she was insulting him in this case.  \n\nIf you want to know what somebody thinks, you ask them.  You don't supply a theory and ask them if you're right.", "Again, that is your perception, not a fact. And although that's not the proper social etiquette, you most certainly can provide a theory and ask if you're correct. I think your interpretation of what OP said is what is confusing me right now, as I'm seeing more assumptions about how OP must have meant things rather than making judgements purely based on the words OP wrote.", "OP literally said 'do you think you're jealous of us having highschool friends because, when you were in highschool, you were socially maladjusted, and had no friends?'"]}
