He remarks how \u201csad and weird\u201d it is for anyone to still be in contact with friends from high school, how \u201ccringe\u201d it is to keep in touch with a high school teacher, and how anyone who still speaks to high school friends is so \u201cpathetic\u201d and peaked in high school.\n\nMost people still have friends from high school who visit in college, or they go home to visit, so this happens quite often, with him viewing it as very sad and scandalous to talk to friends from high school.\n\nThere\u2019s a very friendly, nice girl in our study group.

Trying to get him to see things rationally won't likely happen.  I think there's a very good reason he doesn't have many friends, but this wouldn't be the type of person I'd want to provoke.  I'd try to distance myself from him, and let his opinions go in one ear and out the other.  I graduated back in the 70's, and I still talk to many of my friends from school!  Most people I've known still keep in touch!  I don't think this guy understands the concepts of friendship, and he does seem like a social oddball.  For those very reasons, I'd stop engaging with him.  Something not quite balanced about him.", "NTA and it\u2019s easy to imagine why people didn\u2019t want to be his friend then, as now.", "NTA. he literally proved your point. \u201cyou\u2019re one of them\u201d actually made me laugh", "NTA clearly he has a bug up his butt about high school. He sounds shitty i would stear clear of this guy", "NTA there might've been a nicer way to go about it like asking about his high school experience, but it seems like you already had a good idea about his high school experience. Even if it came across harsh to him, your question to him sounds completely valid", "NTA  \n\n\nBut you weren't helping. Not that you owe him help, because you don't.", "NTA. I mean, I personally don\u2019t talk to people from high school much either, except my one best friend. Even still, that\u2019s just an overreaction to his own lack of good experiences in high school.", "NTA. He just pissed because he got called out for his shitty behavior after remembering he had a shitty high school life. It hurts to remember but it's not your problem to fix his mentality towards the topic", "NTA. Dude needs to realize there's a whole array of high school experiences beyond The Popular People and The Outcasts. High school was miserable for me, but I'm happy to hear from the friends who made it bearable all these years later.\n\nI'm sure his bitterness serves some function for him, but using it to lash out at people who did nothing to contribute to his misery is uncalled for. You were well within your rights, and totally doing the right thing by sticking up for that girl.", "NTA there was nothing wrong with your approach or what you said. He seems very insecure if he feels the need to be so negative about other people being happy about seeing their friends.", "Lol NTA. Guy obviously has major issues but honestly it's something for his therapist to work out, not you.", "You should tell him that since he will undoubtedly consider it cringe to speak to college friends after graduation, you\u2019re just going to jump start that process by refusing to speak to him starting now.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "If *beauty is truth, truth beauty* and all that jazz - no way you're the first person to break it to him that he's a curmudgeonly a hole?\n\nI bet even his grandma has told him that to his face by now?\n\nAt any rate, NTA. In order to have friends you have to know how to be a friend.", "NTA\n\nBut I think they know, you didn't really \"break it out\" to that person. However, it's good called it - that person is just being snarky. At this young age it's still common to keep connections with multiple people from high school.", "Sounds bitter. NTA", "NTA. You may be the only one who came out and told the truth. He will either think it over and gain some insight, or he will just go on throwing that pity party. I do actually feel sorry for him, but the only person who can solve his problem is him.", "NTA\n\nI mean, I don't think there's anyway for you to have \"gently\" said he had no friends in high school and is just jealous.  But you are totally fine in calling him out for attacking people for perfectly normal behavior, so NTA.", "NTA. He is clearly very bitter and jealous of everyone who is doing well. There is nothing wrong with keeping friends and I certainly wouldn\u2019t be \u2018gently\u2019 saying anything. I would be telling him straight, he sounds like a bitter man who resents anyone who has managed to keep friends from high school. If he doesn\u2019t change his attitude he will lose the friends he has now.", "NTA\n\nThere is something seriously wrong with this guy. He probably didn\u2019t do well in high school. It\u2019s not others that can\u2019t move on, It is him. He can\u2019t get past whatever trauma he faced. So he acts like this. I would suggest you just stay away from him. Unless he sees a therapist, he will not get better.", "NTA. You could have worded it a bit more tactfully, but \nI think his comments needed to be challenged. Lots of people keep in touch with high school friends.", "NTA.", "NTA. Sounds like you hit the nail on the head.", "Yeah, psychologically profiling someone when they didn't ask you to is a pretty asshole move even if you're right. Better would have been to ask him not to say that kind of thing around you because it makes you uncomfortable to shit talk other people. That way you're addressing the behaviour and not the person. Hard to come back from calling someone a loser so this friendship may be over.  His behaviour is also of the asshole variety. Not sure he can change.", "YTA\n\nMaybe he thinks no one should talk to high school friends because he was relentlessly bullied in high school and your saying he was the socially maladjusted one puts the blame for that on him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
