They didn\u2019t have said item, so I grabbed a box of the Entemann\u2019s donuts. The crumble ones that look kind of like coffee cakes. It was 8 in the box and it cost me $4. That was earlier, barely 7 hours ago. Out of the whole box I had 1 donut. My sister managed to eat the remaining 7 donuts, and only said something because I walked into the kitchen. Something told me to look in the garbage and the box was in there, and I got upset. Picked the box up and went around asking who ate ALL of the donuts. My sister is 19 by the way. She laughs and says it was her, smiling at me and saying that it\u2019s not that serious. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen my sister eat those donuts in my entire life, I\u2019ve never seen or heard her say that she liked them. So I got mad and told her how I just bought them earlier, and that there was no reason as to why the whole box is gone. So she got kind of defensive and said that she was hungry, and then yelled at me when I told her that if she was hungry she should\u2019ve eaten food and not a snack. So she starts yelling at me saying that I\u2019m being selfish and how it\u2019s just donuts and that it\u2019s not that serious. So I told her that if it wasn\u2019t that serious she could pay me $4 dollars for the donuts that she stole. \n\nMy sister kicked me out of her room and said that I\u2019m dragging it, and that I can just buy more donuts and that she\u2019s not giving me the $4 because she didn\u2019t steal anything.

If a man cannot enjoy his donuts in peace, what kind of world do we live in?", "Completely NTA, and I'm frankly shocked at how many people are acting like they'd be just fine if someone ate 87.5% of something they bought less than half a day earlier. Older sis is just greedy.", "NTA, but I can see how $4 is a bigger deal at 15 than at 19.  Your sister failed to see that and dismissed your concern out of hand, which was AH behavior.", "nta. This reminds me of my bday last year. I bought the cake mix for a gluten free cake mix. Bought lactose free cream to make the ganache and made myself a gf mud cake for my BIRTHDAY. It was completely entact when i went to work and when i got back there was a tiny sliver left. My younger brother had eaten most of my bday cake while i was out of the house. When i said something he told me \"you should have put a sign on it saying not to eat it if i couldnt eat it\" That was the day i decided to get my own fridge and if my mum and brother (whom i rented with and paid 33% of the rent to live there) couldnt act with human decency they wouldnt have stuff stored in a fridge they had access to. After that i would come out with things stored in my fridge and be called an AH for keeping things all to myself", "NTA.

Mention to your mom that you bought donuts because the store was out of whatever it was she wanted (I'm assuming it was something sweet and cake-like).
