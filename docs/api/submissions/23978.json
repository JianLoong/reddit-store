You bought those doughnuts and she pigged into the lot of them without even asking. If it's \"just $4\" and \"not a big deal\" she should \"just\" give you your money back for the food that she stole from you.", "Are you sure he didn\u2019t find them while trying to indulge in something creepier? Do you still live with him?", "That\u2019s making 7 meals of a snack. Unless they are the tiny ones", "Worse, if you factor in the exchange rate\u2026.", "I don't think it's even the price point that's the issue, it's the principle. $4 or $40, it's damn rude to kill off food or drinks that someone's been saving to enjoy later. \n\nThat happened between me and my bro when we lived together. I told him I didn't care that he drank my $2 beer but to replace it if he drinks it. I hated reaching into the fridge at the end of a long day to find nothing there. On top of that, I absolutely abhor shopping, so there's that too.\n\nYour sister should stop being an AH and replace it.", ">A not very donut filled world\n\nA donut hole...?", ":(", "My endodontist gave me 2 prescriptions, one for pharmacy, the other with a pint of H\u00e4agen-Dazs dazs that said to take one spoon as needed. I needed it.", "She probably didn't intend to eat 20+ either but probably had 1 or 2  got stoned, then got the munchies, then ate more browies to satisfy the munchies and so on.\nIt's a viscous cycle, my friend.lol", "Awww, I\u2019ll bet you did! What a nice touch.", "That was years ago and I consider it the gold standard.", "Endodontists are not a in profession that inspires tremendous gratitude, or humor.\n\nMy husband needed a root canal in Key West, where we spend the winter, and was amused that he could get one only on alternate Tuesdays. (For many medical procedures, we go to Miami, nearly four hours north.)", "Alternate Tuesdays sounds quite convenient/s\n\nWell everyone hate dentists and hate specialists more. My first root canal was expected and I went to my old school dentists unofficial emergency appointment, turned up at 7:30 and he told me most people wait until there's an infection but I showed after the first twinge so not nearly as bad. Really, the only thing worse than a root canal is not getting the root canal.", "True that!", "NTA. At the end of the day, yeah they\u2019re just donuts and it\u2019s not a MASSIVE deal. But regardless of how much they cost, she has effectively stolen the worth of the donuts. I\u2019m quite proud of you for recognising that it\u2019s the principle rather than the action because guaranteed if the sister knew she could get away with it, you\u2019d have no food for yourself while in that house.", "NTA. I may be Petty but I definitely would be stealing her food because it's not a big deal", "Not the arsehole. \n\nNow for revenge. Leave it alone for a day or two so your sister isn't still full from eating those donuts.\n\nGo back to the shops and buy more donuts, the plain cinnamon ones. Also buy laxative chocolate and make a nice chocolate icing for them.\n\nLeave them in the kitchen, make a big scene and tell your sister not to eat your donuts again.\n\nMake sure there is not so much as a single square of toilet paper in the house.", "NTA.\n\nHer being hungry and just eating something she can find is not that big of a deal. But what is the big deal is her not compensating and apologising for that. She should have bought you new donuts from the shops and apologised. Then case close. She is being a jerk.", "If she didn\u2018t ask to have a donut, SHE STOLE from you. If she took all donuts, she\u2018s a PIG. And if she kicks you out for rightfully protesting, she\u2018s a damn asshole. \n\nNTA. Can you get your parents involved so they can make her replace them?", "NTA\n\nYou bought it, and she ate 7/8 of it like a pig without your permission. If it's not yours or you're expected to share it, you don't freaking eat all of it.", "Charge her the $3.50 for it", "Chill out, all siblings fight like this. No big deal, you will get over it.", "NTA next time put up a hidden camera and push record.. this way when she scarfs down all of your donuts you can put it on social media... you can put a very creative caption on the video... make sure to have her face in pain view as well...revenge.. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. She didn't purchase them so she had no right to eat them. Even if your oarents had bought them she should have made sure there was enough for the whole family.", "That was the live example of projecting in its purest form", "This is making my head hurt. Your mother sent you to the deli for *deodorant*, which of course they didn't have, so you went to the supermarket, which also didn't have it because obviously, so you bought a box of donuts?!?", "Do explain how OP is in any way shape or form an AH for being upset that something she purchased with her own money was mostly consumed by her sister within 7 hours. Go on. See if you don't look like a clown.", "NTA\n\nMost women I know do this.\n\n>She laughs and says it was her, smiling at me and saying that it\u2019s not that serious.\n\nThey act like the shitty thing they just did isn't a big deal, and you'll let it go.\n\n>So she got kind of defensive and said that she was hungry, and then yelled at me\n\nThen they try to make you the bad guy for making a big deal out of being wronged.\n\n\"Uwu sorry I did a bad thing, I didn't mean to\" annoying", "I\u2019m petty. I\u2019d wait until she cooked something or bought something and then eat it all. Like I said I am petty.", "NTA \n\nShe will have to deal with the extra sugar/weight in the future... It's practically self-sabotage.", "NTA\u2026. Does your sister have an eating disorder?", "NTA\n\nNever ever eat someone else\u2019s Entemanns without asking.", "NTA but can't your parents tell her to pay you back and stop freeloading off of you? \n\nI mean she's 19, she needs to take responsibility.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a selfish pig.", "> So I told her that if it wasn\u2019t that serious she could pay me $4 dollars for the donuts that she stole.\n\nCome on, at 15 you should know better: $3.50.\n\nNTA.", "Yta. Your poor sister was hungry and deserved donuts unlike your lazy bum", "Worse: If a _girl_ cannot enjoy her donuts in peace, what kind of world do we live in?", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. Eating 7 donuts in one go screams eating disorder.", "Sounds like you sister learned that behaviour from him. He set precedence and she followed.!", "I have a similar-ish story, kinda. We had some special leftover cake at home. And everyday (maybe a Tuesday or Wednesday after a Sunday) a large amount of it kept disappearing and I only had one piece. So that day before coming home I called my mom and my sister and argued with them to leave me the cake and that I didn't have any (just assuming everyone is eating it except me), probably pissed everyone off, but they agreed not to touch the cake idk if they even care besides me arguing with them. And I come home to find it gone. And found out my dad was exclusively eating it claiming he didn't want it to go bad. \n\nEveryone in my family knows this story well because I bring it up. Almost 2 decades later and I still remember seeing my dad finish that cake.", "Well it's a mix of both. It's $4, it's the time and effort going to the store, picking out the donuts and bringing them home. It's the lack of respect to just eat them without replacing them.", "I'd make getting a job your focus if possible. It will feel like you at least have some breathing space with regards to money.\n\nIn those circumstances, don't let having another 4 dollars because of a job change your opinion on this. That's money for a slice of your life you don't get back.", "I have an endo friend in nj who is retired but still works part time ... every other Tuesday \ud83d\ude04 I wonder if that's just the standard!"]}
