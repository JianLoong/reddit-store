He is entitled and that\u2019s the type of person I\u2019d love to smack. Just rude", "NTA\n\nYou were right, the rules dont just apply to one person they apply to everyone, and he shouldn't get special treatment", "NTA. People who won't observe phone etiquette on flights deserve no, I repeat NO mercy. Other potential assholes in this situation: the flight attendants who didn't do their jobs and get the guy to hang up.", "YTA for acting outside the scope of your assignment.", "YTA the rule is meaningless", "YTA. This isn\u2019t your responsibility. \n\nIf cell phones could dangerously interfere with radio communication there wouldn\u2019t be cell phones on planes.", "NTA. The rules are there for a reason. Technically it\u2019s possible that it could interfere with radio communication but unlikely. Either way air travel rules are in place to minimize safety risks. One small interference between the pilots and air traffic control could cause planes to collide which is bad. There are way more near misses out there then most people know about.\n\nEdit to add\u2026 I was on a plane about to take off once and this random guy behind was loudly complaining to his girlfriend about how stupid it was that TSA won\u2019t let people on planes use cellphones. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I turned around and politely told him TSA has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s an FAA rule they are completely different government agencies. Then explained what I said above. He was actually nice about it and didn\u2019t know why the rule was there. No he knows.", "ESH", "NTA..\n\nYou have a reason to say something considering you\u2019re both sharing the same flight. However, I\u2019d leave it up to the flight attendant next time.", "NTA but a phone won't actually do anything to an airplane", "ESH. Him for having his phone out and being loud and you for not minding your business. There's a call FA button for a reason and you should use it next time.", "NTA everyone has to follow the same rules. I\u2019m not sure what happens with cell interference but I\u2019m sure there is a reason they ask you to use airplane mode.", "NTA.", "Nta but seriously that\u2019s what the attendants are for.", " YTA. Call the flight attendant", "Well\u2026..it won\u2019t really interfere with radio signals. They know many passengers don\u2019t put phones in airplane mode.  \n\nESH.  He shouldn\u2019t have been on the phone.  It\u2019s not your job to police things.", "ESH. You can tell him to get off his phone because he\u2019s making noise with no headphones but asking him to put it on airplane mode is ridiculous. No one follows that and it doesn\u2019t make a difference.", "NTA, sometime it is better to just ring the flight attendent.", "Ya because that tiny little phone is gonna phuck everything up...mind your business there's flight attendants for a reason...\n\nAlso, before you wanna offer your two cents THINK of the outcome.. serves you right for having an awkward flight", "Counter point if cell phones didn't have any potential to mess up communications they wouldn't have the rule where you have to put them on airplane mode.", "The flight attendants were already seated and buckled", "I agree. I think I've read before that it's very unlikely to cause interference, but I don't want to take that chance. Plus it's just rude to the attendants who have clearly asked to put it on airplane mode", "Nothing happens it\u2019s a rule so are less distracted", "I think Myth busters did an episode on it. They couldn't get it to show any interference during their tests. Dosent mean it's not possible in certain cases. Same with using phones at a gas station", "Flight attendant's were already seated and buckled. Didn't even think of how to get their attention tbh", "If it can't potentially fuck with communications, then why do they have the rule you have to be on airplane mode?", "A lot of folks forget to put stuff on airplane mode and it hasn\u2019t done much", "It is rude. Cause then they have to stop, and tell specifically him, the same thing they announced to everyone else. Some people just think they\u2019re above the rules everyone else has to follow, and those people are generally AHs.", "If it was a serious risk they would actually check everybody\u2019s phone to make sure it\u2019s on airplane mode. The amount of people who don\u2019t actually put their phone on airplane mode is a lot", "I really think it\u2019s for exactly this reason: who wants spend their flight surrounded by people yakking on their phones?", "And if it wasn't a risk at all they wouldn't have that rule"]}
