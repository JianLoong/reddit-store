That may have been a concern with old technology, but there are plenty of laws/rules still on the books that have no bearing in today's world. For instance in my state it's actually technically illegal to buy meat on a Sunday.\n\nCell phone technology has changed tremendously over the years and I myself (And I'd bet a lot of people) have had my headphones on or just forgotten to put it in airplane mode on MANY flights and nothing has ever happened.\n\nThe main point though that many people have tried to make is that it's not your place to tell anyone to do anything on a flight and if you have a concern then you should've called an attendant to deal with it.", "The rule was put in place when it wasn't really known if they are interferences.\n\nNow it's established there are none, it's safe. But the rule still stands because it helps keeping passengers less distracted through take-off and landing, aka the most dangerous parts of any flight.", "There was a time when they  thought it would do harm.

The average aeroplane passenger that stands up before the plane has stopped after landing and the seatbelt sign is still on? Nah, mate. If it was that critical, they would do something to actually ensure that the rule is followed.", "The other reason it's recommended to switch phones off is that if there's a problem, passengers are paying attention.", "wait what about using your phone at a gas station", "The gas pump thing is a myth and has been repeatedly debunked by researchers intentionally trying to cause a reaction to no avail. The most the NFPA has to say on the matter is that there's a very low chance (political speak for \"I don't want the liability if I go on the record saying it's a myth\") and the FTC has outright denounced the theory as bunk.

They have since proven it doesn\u2019t really have any effect on the plane\u2019s communication and the EU actually announced they they will be discontinuing the rule last December. The rule persists in other places like the US, not for safety reasons but bc it increases attention during safety announcements, situational awareness during take off and landing and generally encourages good mass transit etiquette. (Ever been on a subway, bud or train? They generally announce that voice calls aren\u2019t permitted on board and ask you to refrain from playing music out loud. Not that that stops some people.) \n\nSo while you can absolutely argue the guy was being rude to make everyone else trapped in the metal tube with him listen to his conversation, he didn\u2019t actually put anyone in danger.", "Because the government are control freaks.", "Right.

Never turn it off.", "Nah, I fly frequently out to minesites all over Australia and some of the smaller airlines require all devices to be off including headphones.

At the very least you won't have a dead battery when you land.", "90 % of people don't follow that rule and haven't for sometime because it's been shown to be false.
