However, it was clearly labeled as one.\n\nThat means you were either escalating a situation with an untrained dog or interfering with the work of a service animal. Neither of which are good things.\n\nIf also think from a safety perspective it\u2019s never smart to escalate a situation on a trail. I\u2019m also not sure how you expected this person to react. Did you want them to start begging your pardon? Suddenly train the dog to be right next to them and immediately get away from you with a look of horror and shame?

What if they, or their dog, reacted in a more dangerous way?\n\nIf there are rangers or other types of workers for this preserve you could have mentioned to them after the hike that you were concerned about the misuse of service dogs.

Very clearly the AH.", "YTA. YTA. YTA. You remind me of bicyclists who ride in the middle of a road even with a designated bike lane, in that you have a sense of entitlement. Add the fact that you are in no way shape or form trained to evaluate what is or is not a service animal means you literally have no dog in this fight. \n\nOh did I mention that YAMFA?", "Soft YTA. People who need service animals have a plethora of reasons to have it, beyond physical disability. Unfortunately, there's absolutely zero policies in place that prevent able-bodied people buying certificates, buying the vest and leashes and putting them on their regular dog to get around the rules and they do that more often than not. **No, really. You can get a cat, and buy a vest meant for a small dog that says \"service animal\" and just take your cat everywhere and nobody can say anything about it so long as the cat is under your control, housebroken, and not causing a disturbance to others.**\n\nRather than calling them out, you observe the service animal. Genuine service animals will have excellent leash handling, not be wandering, sniffing around, using the bathroom without being given permission from their handler, and will not immediately run up to other people while they are \"on duty.\" They will also have a certain stance about them that says \"vigilance\" if they are monitoring their handler.\n\nIf you feel the animal is not a real service animal, just give a wide berth, and ignore the handler and dog. If the dog approaches you, just look firmly at the handler and say \"ma'am please call back your service dog. Please maintain control of your service animal, I do not want to be responsible if your service animal misses alerting you of a medical emergency, please call back your service animal.\"\n\nEmotional support animals do not need to be trained at all, and are still protected under ADA guidelines. So long as the animal is not posing a threat to people or other animals, is under the control of the handler, is not incontinent, then there's nothing you can do. Absolutely nothing you can do.\n\nAre you breaking the law by telling this woman what you think of her service animal? Nope. Is it petty? Absolutely.\n\nThe woman, as the handler and owner of the animal, assumes all risk and responsibility if she is faking her animal being a service animal. It's hurting the people who need it the most over anything else, but there's nothing to be done until the dog actually poses a threat or displays behavior that proves it's not a service animal, but instead a comfort animal or emotional support animal.\n\nEven then, calling them out is a dick move, but it won't fix anything long term. This woman will just make it harder for those who have real service animals to be able to have their animals in public.\n\nOn a personal level, you did what I would like to say to people who have animals that are clearly not service animals. On a personal level, I say well done. But I'm living today as a terrible warning to others, not as an example to live by.\n\nEDITED TO REMOVE ANY PREJUDICE OF NORMAL BEING TRANSLATED TO ABLE BODIED. IT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION TO COME OFF AS INSENSITIVE AND I APOLOGIZE.", "NTA. Service dogs are never on extendable leashes. And I'm tired of people calling everything an emotional support animal. Actual service animals come from trainers and clearly, not everybody who has Muffin in a yellow  vest has a service animal. It makes it more difficult for those who have legitimate service dogs.", "YTA without question for many reasons. You can be as angry as you want but not at her. It's not her fault you don't understand the trails policy on service dogs. You pursued this fight when she rightly ignored you and then you went on to tell her that her service dog was FAKE?!? And now here you are \"assuming she doesn't have a disability\". Maybe look into the differences between service dogs and support animals. Even if you had a legitimate reason to think it was fake which you obviously didn't, you are not the NPS trail police and should have left it in their hands.

That name is \u201cService Animal\u201d and they are trained specifically to serve their person in a working capacity. When they have received, or are even in the process of receiving, that training they are designated a service animal.\n\nThere is a reason \u201cemotional support animals\u201d are not referred to as service animals. Because they aren\u2019t.\n\nThe difference is blatantly apparent with the way the animals and people act. My cousin with PTSD has a dog that never leave his side when his vest is on, and frankly avoids taking him in places where dogs are not welcome unless needed as a service animal.
