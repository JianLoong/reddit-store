However, it was clearly labeled as one.\n\nThat means you were either escalating a situation with an untrained dog or interfering with the work of a service animal. Neither of which are good things.\n\nIf also think from a safety perspective it\u2019s never smart to escalate a situation on a trail. I\u2019m also not sure how you expected this person to react. Did you want them to start begging your pardon? Suddenly train the dog to be right next to them and immediately get away from you with a look of horror and shame?

Very clearly the AH.", "YTA. YTA. YTA. You remind me of bicyclists who ride in the middle of a road even with a designated bike lane, in that you have a sense of entitlement. Add the fact that you are in no way shape or form trained to evaluate what is or is not a service animal means you literally have no dog in this fight. \n\nOh did I mention that YAMFA?", "Soft YTA. People who need service animals have a plethora of reasons to have it, beyond physical disability. Unfortunately, there's absolutely zero policies in place that prevent able-bodied people buying certificates, buying the vest and leashes and putting them on their regular dog to get around the rules and they do that more often than not. **No, really. You can get a cat, and buy a vest meant for a small dog that says \"service animal\" and just take your cat everywhere and nobody can say anything about it so long as the cat is under your control, housebroken, and not causing a disturbance to others.**\n\nRather than calling them out, you observe the service animal. Genuine service animals will have excellent leash handling, not be wandering, sniffing around, using the bathroom without being given permission from their handler, and will not immediately run up to other people while they are \"on duty.\" They will also have a certain stance about them that says \"vigilance\" if they are monitoring their handler.\n\nIf you feel the animal is not a real service animal, just give a wide berth, and ignore the handler and dog. If the dog approaches you, just look firmly at the handler and say \"ma'am please call back your service dog. Please maintain control of your service animal, I do not want to be responsible if your service animal misses alerting you of a medical emergency, please call back your service animal.\"\n\nEmotional support animals do not need to be trained at all, and are still protected under ADA guidelines. So long as the animal is not posing a threat to people or other animals, is under the control of the handler, is not incontinent, then there's nothing you can do. Absolutely nothing you can do.\n\nAre you breaking the law by telling this woman what you think of her service animal? Nope. Is it petty? Absolutely.\n\nThe woman, as the handler and owner of the animal, assumes all risk and responsibility if she is faking her animal being a service animal. It's hurting the people who need it the most over anything else, but there's nothing to be done until the dog actually poses a threat or displays behavior that proves it's not a service animal, but instead a comfort animal or emotional support animal.\n\nEven then, calling them out is a dick move, but it won't fix anything long term. This woman will just make it harder for those who have real service animals to be able to have their animals in public.\n\nOn a personal level, you did what I would like to say to people who have animals that are clearly not service animals. On a personal level, I say well done. But I'm living today as a terrible warning to others, not as an example to live by.\n\nEDITED TO REMOVE ANY PREJUDICE OF NORMAL BEING TRANSLATED TO ABLE BODIED. IT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION TO COME OFF AS INSENSITIVE AND I APOLOGIZE.", "NTA. Service dogs are never on extendable leashes. And I'm tired of people calling everything an emotional support animal. Actual service animals come from trainers and clearly, not everybody who has Muffin in a yellow  vest has a service animal. It makes it more difficult for those who have legitimate service dogs.", "YTA without question for many reasons. You can be as angry as you want but not at her. It's not her fault you don't understand the trails policy on service dogs. You pursued this fight when she rightly ignored you and then you went on to tell her that her service dog was FAKE?!? And now here you are \"assuming she doesn't have a disability\". Maybe look into the differences between service dogs and support animals. Even if you had a legitimate reason to think it was fake which you obviously didn't, you are not the NPS trail police and should have left it in their hands.

Think of the dog like a wheelchair or a pair of glasses. This person deserves to access a place they enjoy, but they can\u2019t access it without the dog otherwise they are at an increased risk. I can hike fine in my glasses and an inhaler. If I don\u2019t have my glasses I\u2019m highly likely to fall or get lost because I cant see. If I don\u2019t pack an I haler I\u2019m more likely to have a medical emergency. I should be allowed to go places with those things since they make it possible for me.

And that has led to various problems and more skepticism about service animals. But ESAs are NOT actual service animals. Service animals are solely dogs, of any breed, and are protected in US law under ADA regulations:\n\nhttps://www.ada.gov/topics/service-animals/\n\n> In this situation, why would the person with the service animal choose a dog-free trail? \n\nFor the same reasons anyone would choose this trail. A service animal is an accommodation that allows a person with a disability equitable access. Asking why they would use it is a bit like asking why someone with a wheelchair would choose a building that was originally built with stairs.\n\n>you are probably also aware that the people on that trail may have chosen it specifically to avoid dogs, no?\n\nLet's not equate a disability with people's preference. When we start saying individual preferences justify denying someone accommodations that's headed to a nasty place. Also a service animal has different training than a family pet. A family pet may have various levels of training, a service animal is specifically trained to assist their owner in any situation. So the kinds of issues that come up with a family pet largely shouldn't occur with service animals and for that reason personal preference to not be around dogs doesn't have the same weight to me with regard to a trained service dog.\n\n> It seems odd to go on one when presumably there are others, and probably more of them, that are all dog inclusive?\n\n1) Not really relevant in that the POINT of a service animal is to give the owner access to all the trails.\n\n2) Not always a good option because poorly trained dogs may approach the service animal and attempt to distract them. The service dog should be trained for that, but it can still be a stressor for the person.", "Something else I wonder about is that the dog  is on an extendable leash.

The law actually states that both parties should have proper accomodations, both the service dog handler and those with allergies.

Now private places, like private companies or like a private country club, can do whatever they want and deny a service animal (service animal instead of service dog because technically they can be either dogs or miniature horses). If this trail was at some privately run park area that had some sort of members only policy and was not a publicly funded park, then they could technically be denied or asked to leave.

If there\u2019s dogs off leash that run up and distract the service dog it could cause the dog to miss some sort of medical alert for the handler and harm them.
