Staying without paying is one thing, but using your beauty product without consent is another! What's wrong with her and how is your roommate okay with this!?!

No it wasn't fair but he decided it was his best option at the time.  \n\nI'm really wondering if staying would be good for you long term.  I can easily see this becoming a them vs. you situation.

If they decline, talk to your landlord and see the process for how to break the lease, because they aren't going to change.

She sounds terrible. \n\nCould you move in with your boyfriend? At least until you find a new place?", "Agreed, pricing to me depends on if it's still a shared space or they are exclusively using it, if it's exclusively for her stuff then they should definitely be paying 1/3rd rent.", "Well, unfortunately that does make you quite stuck.  Why can\u2019t you rehome the dog?

Especially since you didn\u2019t agree to the gf moving in?\n\nSomething\u2019s got to give.  You move or they pay, or everyone\u2019s rent goes up, or you get run over by both of them.", "No you can rent the room privately through the landlord or take out the tenancy together. I have also lived on a few different continents.", "Then I should only pay rent for my room, which is 1/3. She might not sleep or have s*x in the third room, but it's occupied by her. Also our LL rented us the whole house and not each room.", "Can't believe I had to read this far to also see this answer.\n\nI could buy a 55 (roommate + girlfriend) to 45 (op) split in this situation, as 60-40 is barely different from splitting into even thirds. Just fwiw", "Of course I wouldn't rehome my dog for them. He isn't a toy and I really love him. As for the raise, it won't be a lot of money, but still I don't want to pay higher rent because she doesn't want to pay.", "Why can't she rehome the dog? You obviously don't have pets.", "If she uses the third room at all, she\u2019s renting it. Otherwise, she can stay elsewhere. If he wants her to stay, he can cover her part of the rent.

Do you collect it then send, does your co tenant, or do you both pay separately? \n\nI'd be actively looking for a new place.", "I mean 55-50 is pretty damn close to paying half like OP is currently doing, at least 60-40 is further from \"even thirds\" than that.\n\nThere's pretty much no situation short of incredibly dire where I'd agree to save 5% (almost certainly in the two-digit $ range) to have A WHOLE OTHER PERSON living in my space.", "Things like the infuriate me. Lock your stuff up.", "You wouldn\u2019t be rehoming your dog for them, it would be for YOU to get out of what\u2019s devolving into a toxic situation.

Wouldn\u2019t your rent actually be less for overall if you split the slightly higher rent three ways instead of splitting the lower rent two ways?\n\nSeriously, what are your actual options here? What can you make happen?", "Usually my roommate does", "Well I'm thinking of giving them one more chance. Next month I will only give my 1/3. If they won't accept it I will announce that I will move out as soon as I find a new place and until then I will only pay the 1/3. They can't evict me and if they try to make my living hell, well I'm too petty when I have too", "So you could simply start sending them only 1/3 the rent amount. This would lead to some arguments though. \n\nI do not know where you are located but typically you cannot unilaterally invite someone to live with you and not have them pay. They are taking away from your use of the property.\n\nIf it went to court, you have evidence the new person uses the 3rd room and common areas. Take pictures of their stuff in the third room. \n\nTough with the food, if it is in the fridge you can't really move it to your room. I'd move everything of yours to your room, you shouldn't have to, but these roommates are being ridiculously entitled. \n\nYou should also blatantly tell them that your stuff is not theirs to use, sounds like they are the type of people to then turn that around on you and call you selfish or some shit, they are wrong. They have made it clear it is everyone for themselves. \n\nTell them point blank to stop using or eating your stuff. Tell them point blank that the gf is expected to pay 1/3 rent and utilities.", "That a girl. Good luck and stay strong.", "NTA\n\nIf she's using the third room then that needs a lock so she can't.  She's already getting use of the communal living areas.\n\nHopefully you get out sooner rather than later.\n\nIf the LL does raise the rent, would 1/3 of this be less than the half that you are paying now?\n\nMy daughter has this situation in her share house.  One of the girls has her boyfriend living there full time paying nothing.  The rent is all inclusive but the LL doesn't know there's an extra person there full time.  Two of the housemates don't have a partner.  The other one does but she's not there very often for over nights as she has a home of her own (still lives with her parents).  But no one has told the LL yet.", "NTA. Find yourself a studio apartment and move out. I say a studio b/c then you won\u2019t have to deal with shitty roommates.", "NTA - You need to bring this up again before rent is due - make it clear that as long as she is sleeping in the house you will only be contributing 1/3 of the costs. That is absolutely Non-negotiable & you would hate to have to get the landlord involved because that would mean that the rent increases for all of you - and be prepared to do exactly that.", "NTA\n\nIf she can't or won't pay rent, then he should cover her portions.\n\nThe rent for two people in one room should be slightly less than 2/3 of the total. I don't think it's fair to be a full 2/3 unless the shared room has worthy perks, and/or the other rooms are relatively bad.\n\nAside from the bedrooms, the rest of the common-use parts of the house should count as an additional room and split that portion of rent evenly between everyone.", "I would look into moving out even though it's difficult.

It's possible if they figure out that you're looking for somewhere else to go, they'll pull their heads out of their asses and figure out they have to be more equitable.

F them. That or ask them to leave", "NTA if you can, not sure the rules, have her served by the police or something to kick her out.", "NTA. I can't tell you how to handle it, but I can tell you how not to handle it. 1000% do not compromise to just pay half. Ive been there, and anecdotally theyll screw you the first chance they get.", "I don't agree that 50/50 rent is fair, because the common areas are shared between three people, especially if there is just one bathroom this can make a pretty big difference in someone's habits. \n\nOne fairer way to do this is to add up the common areas, divide it by the number of people, and then assign the full rent of each room to the appropriate people.  For example, suppose Alex and Blake are a couple in one room and Charlie is in another room.   Each bedroom is 250 square feet and the common areas are 500 square feet for 1000 sqft in total.  Suppose the rent is $1000/month to make it easy. This means that Alex and Blake together pay for 2/3rds of the common area, or $367 , plus $250 for their bedroom, or $617 in total.  Charlie pays 1/3rd of 500 for the common area so $133, plus their room at $250, or $383.   Obviously bills are divided per person as well unless there's some extenuating circumstance. \n\nEven if you don't know the exact square footage you can estimate something similar and it should be close enough.  \n\nHope this helps!", "in my country when the weather starts to get cold you see people try a \"new relationship\" for a few months and end it when it gets warm.
