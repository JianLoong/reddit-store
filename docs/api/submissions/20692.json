Of course, I (25M) am always seen as being sensitive or starting fights, because I was never the right kind of son for them. \n\nMy two older sisters, who I will call Amy, (f29) and Brit (f32) are exactly the kind of kids my parents wanted, married before they were out of high school, baby on the way before the year was out, church every Sunday, whatever. \n\nI on the other hand am aro/ace, an atheist, and a heathen to them, because of my job (which I prefer not to talk about here, as it\u2019s rather revealing).\n\nLike I said before I don\u2019t go to family gatherings often, because of how \u201cfunny\u201d everyone is. But, recently was my mother's birthday, and I was guilted into going by my dad because in his words \u201cwe always tried our best to understand you, and you won\u2019t meet us halfway-\u201c and that she really missed me. Which all felt manipulative to me, but whatever.\n\nI went, I brought a gift (some glass figurines from a collection she loves) and braced for the worst.\n\nSurprisingly everything went well, at first, there were jokes thrown but nothing that really bothered me, so it was fine. Then Brit said something like; \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll ask the question if everyone else is too scared, how\u2019s dating going, Op?\u201d And laughed. \n\nI didn\u2019t want things to devolve so I just smiled and said something like \u201cGood as ever, how\u2019s your husband doing?\u201d \n\nBut she didn\u2019t drop it, and laughed again, offering to set me up with a girl from church, saying maybe she could \u201cscrew my head on right\u201d \n\nAt which point I got very angry and asked to change the subject. \n\nMy other sister asked if I really wasn\u2019t worried about being alone, and said that she just wanted someone to be there to take care of me.\n\nI told her I could take care of myself, I really wanted to change the subject. \n\nMy father butted in that everyone should calm down, because he knows I\u2019m just looking for the right woman, to make an honest man out of me, and laughed, along with everyone else at the table, frankly, I felt humiliated and just wanted to get away from these people. \n\nSo I stood up, and made my way to the door, my mother following me the whole way, asking me to be considerate \u201cWe\u2019re just joking!\u201d And I was so angry I couldn\u2019t stop myself from saying \u201cThis is why I never come over you know? None of you can let me have one visit without being made fun of. You\u2019re worse than children.\u201d and left. \n\nApparently, after I left my mother cried for hours, and my sisters and dad have been blowing up my phone for ruining her birthday over a joke, and demanding I apologize. I do feel bad about making her upset, but why am I the only one being called to apologize? Which is why I\u2019m dragging my feet.

I\u2019m going to be very honest with you, you strike me as someone who has a lot of unresolved conflict with them to the point where it affects your daily life. It also sounds like you have some sibling rivalry going on that maybe your parents didn\u2019t correct or intervene with soon enough when you grew up together.

Listen to their responses or what ever reasoning they give you but continue to tell them that this seriously crosses a boundary for you.\n\nPeople don\u2019t always get things right the first time.

I would say if you do decide to start a relationship with her that is separate, start with some boundaries and ask her to not put you in a position or ask you to spend time with the rest of your family. Tell her that you're feeling hurt and need time to decide what you want your relationship with the rest of them to look like or if you want a relationship with them at all. Make it clear that if you someday choose to open that door again you will come to her, not the other way around. I would also suggest you go into a meeting with your mom having already planned some things to say about her behavior as well. Maybe that you understand it can be hard to talk back to people and go against the norm especially family, but it hurts when she doesn't defend you or ask them stop their behavior and remind her that you are her family too and having someone in your corner would make you feel more welcome and at peace? I don't want to assume how you're feeling, I just always find if I plan what I'm going to say a little before these types of interactions I tend to get my point across better and people understand me more. I can get emotional if I don't plan what I say and then I can't describe my feelings or perspective as well.\n\nAll in all you are NTA and I'm sorry you're going through this.

You don't need to apologize to her, you just need to tell her why you left and what it's gonna take for you all to really \"meet half-way.\" You also need her to tell them THEY ruined the party because they're jokes were what drove you out of it. It's not like you stormed off in the middle of nothing. Whether these were actually harmless jokes in their eyes or their way of meeting you 'half-way' doesn't really matter, what matters is that they don't know when to stop and you told them multiple times when they should have.\n\nHowever, a word of advice, OP and to many others: stop engaging with people like this. If they don't respect you from the get-go, they're not gonna respect a desire to change the subject or move on. Do not show your annoyance or anger at them -- don't ask them to change the subject, just change it and if they persist, keep greyrocking them.

If you feel like you don\u2019t need anyone romantically or sexually, that\u2019s your choice.

Sounds like you are the joke of the family. Did you actually identify yourself as an Ace to them? If so that was a dumb move on your part. Should have just said you are a private person and who you date is none of their business. Doesn't sound like your mother was piling on at dinner so you should call her and have a heart to heart.", "NTA - they seem to think getting married and having children is some kind of achievement , that everybody should lead that kind of lifestyle.\n\nI don't judge them for that but for their assumption that anybody who doesn't do what they do is wrong.  You have been polite and you don't knock them for their lack of intellect or insight, their 'I must run off a cliff with the herd' approach to life.  \n\nYou can't argue with them.  Whether you are straight or gay, doesn't matter as much to these people as being paired up for eternity.  they seem to focus on your marital status.  They think somebody who isn't married is missing out and they will never understand that their lack of freedom is their loss.\n\nThey kept poking until the got the reaction they were looking for.

Whenever I go see my cousin I always end up being \"overly sensitive\"\nJokes about my relationship, how my partner should screw me harder so I am not as tense, calling me a \"child\" because I don't want to drink something that would make me sick, \"I think we should not feed you, you seem to eat too well you gained a few pounds\"\nAnxiety? That's not a thing obviously, you are just not mature yet. I hate to put up with it, walk away when it is too much then be the \"child\" for not indulging in the so called jokes.\nBut nah. Everything can be fixed with jokes about how my partner should screw you back to \"normality\" \nGive me a break.", "I wouldn\u2019t be petty but I would be straight forward. Text them and tell them that it\u2019s time you all cut the crap: their \u201cjoking\u201d is not joking. It\u2019s the cover that they use to disguise that they don\u2019t understand your life or lifestyle to the point that they simply don\u2019t believe it *is* one. They literally somehow cannot imagine anyone not wanting a romantic life partner and therefore instead of respecting what you have told them about yourself, have dismissed it in favor of insisting that you do indeed want a life partner and trying to disguise this dismissal as \u201cjokes.\u201d Tell them that you find it stunning that they somehow haven\u2019t figured out how to have a single conversation in which they don\u2019t zero in on that subject with you instead of the myriad of other topics that exist in the world. Liken it to something they will understand more readily: if you \u201cjoked,\u201d as they do, that they were all secretly gay and their spouses were their \u201cbeards\u201d and their children were surprising examples of how dedicated they were to their fake storylines. Tell them that maybe the first time or two they\u2019d say \u201cok haha\u201d but if you insisted on this \u201cjoke\u201d at every interaction because you were \u201cworried\u201d about them living their lives this way (which must certainly make them miserable), they\u2019d probably get tired of it. Which is where you are: tired of the BS and not excited to put yourself through it every time you see them. Which is why you don\u2019t see them. Then just set up times to hang out with your mom separate from them and decline any invitations firmly but politely until they stop issuing them or you think they may actually have figured out how not to \u201cjoke\u201d about this anymore.", "that\u2019s so cool!! i used to be a scare actor!! i originally started as the SFX artist for the actors, but then they just kinda threw me in too! it\u2019s such a fun job!", "NTA\n\nA joke is something that EVERYONE enjoys and laughs over. Picking on a person is not a joke.\n\nHey family: \"*You value your 'jokes' more than you value a relationship with me because you insist on making them repeatedly every single time you see me. If they are just jokes to you, why is it so important for you to make them? Tell you what, let's spend the next visit 'joking' about \\[some aspect of\\] you! It shouldn't bother you in the least since they are just 'jokes'.*\"\n\nThis mom of an ace hopes you are able to build a circle of people in your life who bring joy to you and with whom you feel loved and accepted just as you are.", "NTA - Ask them to explain the punchline. Guarantee they will fall and fumble. Funnily enough the same trick works with racists.", "NTA but any chance you can use their own Christianity to convince them of the validity of being aro & ace? I think there\u2019s plenty in the New Testament about chastity", "NTA\n\nIf you had laughed along with them then yes it\u2019s a joke, but considering you didn\u2019t laugh and wanted them to stop it\u2019s bullying and they are really crappy Christians \n\nYou should consider just skipping them, they will never change\n\nDo not apologize!!!", "OP, solidly NTA. Your family are the A  Holes; your identity isn\u2019t a joke and it shouldn\u2019t be treated as one. I\u2019d say you actually handled everything in a very calm and respectful manner, unlike your family. I think your mother experienced Instant Regret TM when you were leaving because she knew this could potentially be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, and she did nothing to stop it. \n\nEssentially what they\u2019re \u201cjoking\u201d about is comparable to asking a biological male when he\u2019s going to get pregnant, in my opinion. I wonder if they know anything about the LGBT+ community? Because if you\u2019ve explained to them what Aro and Ace is for you - even if they don\u2019t fully understand it - , then they absolutely have no right to be saying that c rap to you. I\u2019m Pan myself, and I know my family doesn\u2019t fully understand what exactly that means, but they\u2019ve never \u201cjoked\u201d about it. Same with my two older brothers who\u2019ve never really felt a need for a relationship; they\u2019re both happy single. My parents sometimes lament about how they wished they might get girlfriends so they\u2019d be happy and they\u2019re great guys so they\u2019d definitely make someone happy, but my brothers always come back with they\u2019re pretty happy being single. And that\u2019s generally the end of the discussion; it might be brought up again a half year or more down the road, but they never push or joke about it.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to respect. Your family doesn\u2019t respect your identity or you as a person and that\u2019s toxic and not something you should have to deal with. Solidly NTA on your part, OP.", "NTA\n\nYou can apologise to your mum for upsetting her, since that wasn't your intention, while still being clear that you are NOT apologising for leaving when your family picked on you.\n\n\"I'm sorry my visit ended with you feeling bad. That wasn't my intention, and I do feel bad that my actions upset you. But every time I visit, the things everyone says makes me feel terrible. They're not \"jokes\" because a joke is funny. Laughing at my expense or my discomfort is mean, and I don't want to be around people who are mean to me.\"", "NTA my father's family does this all the time, says the most horrible things and then starts with the \"just joking\" bullshit. I handled it the same way you do - I kept my kids away too. Yes, it was their family but I refused to subject my children to that mean behavior. Do not let them gaslight you, they knew exactly what they were doing and if your mother is crying - whatever! They can spend her next birthday picking on each other.", "They started it. Why can\u2019t they shut up for your mother\u2019s sake?! NTA OP.", "NTA.  Good job, you.   You set boundaries and upheld them.   And you should keep doing that.   Any time they needle you, get up and leave.   You don't even have to explain why--they know.   Sooner or later you'll train them.", "NTA and please don't apologize. That just gives them permission to do it again. Live your life and don't worry about their narrow little minds anymore.", "[removed]", "Or ops mother cried her eyes out because she didn't spend time with her son, she is sorry that the others don't respect him and don't have a good relationship, and she can't do enough to solve it.", " If it was important enough to them, they would learn to respect your boundaries.", "Mom knows the issues and does nothing. This probably has been going on from before OP moved out.\n\nDon't apologize OP. And I know it's painful, but it's time to go LC.\n\nFamily is one that does right by you.

They\u2019re attacking OP\u2019s personal identity. I\u2019m not sure if you understand what Aro or Ace is, or what you know about the LGBT+ (sorry, I know I missed a few letters) but I\u2019d compare it to asking a biological male when they\u2019re going to get pregnant.

Maybe offer to make it up to her with a private dinner just the two of you and at that dinner explain to her that she can either accept this new dynamic (celebrate together separate from father and sisters) or not at all because you are sick of their continued use of your life as a punching bag for their amusement.\n\nIf she really loves and respects you, she will accept this boundary and be happy that you are still willing to be in her life. If she doesn't accept but demands an full family or nothing then you know how she really feels (your feelings don't matter as long as she gets what she wants).", "This is not joking. I want you to pretend for a moment that you *were* allo. Imagine that you actually did want a sexual/romantic parter and then think about those \u201cjokes\u201d. What would the joke be about? Mocking your failure to attain something you wish to have? Mocking your loneliness? These are not jokes. Those are *cruelties* and only made worse by the fact that their underlying assumption is that you don\u2019t know who you are and/or who you are is wrong. The whole thing fucking stinks and isn\u2019t right.", "The irony is that the Bible talks a lot about how important people who are called to singleness are for the community.", "Exactly.
