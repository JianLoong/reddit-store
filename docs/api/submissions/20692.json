Of course, I (25M) am always seen as being sensitive or starting fights, because I was never the right kind of son for them. \n\nMy two older sisters, who I will call Amy, (f29) and Brit (f32) are exactly the kind of kids my parents wanted, married before they were out of high school, baby on the way before the year was out, church every Sunday, whatever. \n\nI on the other hand am aro/ace, an atheist, and a heathen to them, because of my job (which I prefer not to talk about here, as it\u2019s rather revealing).\n\nLike I said before I don\u2019t go to family gatherings often, because of how \u201cfunny\u201d everyone is. But, recently was my mother's birthday, and I was guilted into going by my dad because in his words \u201cwe always tried our best to understand you, and you won\u2019t meet us halfway-\u201c and that she really missed me. Which all felt manipulative to me, but whatever.\n\nI went, I brought a gift (some glass figurines from a collection she loves) and braced for the worst.\n\nSurprisingly everything went well, at first, there were jokes thrown but nothing that really bothered me, so it was fine. Then Brit said something like; \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll ask the question if everyone else is too scared, how\u2019s dating going, Op?\u201d And laughed. \n\nI didn\u2019t want things to devolve so I just smiled and said something like \u201cGood as ever, how\u2019s your husband doing?\u201d \n\nBut she didn\u2019t drop it, and laughed again, offering to set me up with a girl from church, saying maybe she could \u201cscrew my head on right\u201d \n\nAt which point I got very angry and asked to change the subject. \n\nMy other sister asked if I really wasn\u2019t worried about being alone, and said that she just wanted someone to be there to take care of me.\n\nI told her I could take care of myself, I really wanted to change the subject. \n\nMy father butted in that everyone should calm down, because he knows I\u2019m just looking for the right woman, to make an honest man out of me, and laughed, along with everyone else at the table, frankly, I felt humiliated and just wanted to get away from these people. \n\nSo I stood up, and made my way to the door, my mother following me the whole way, asking me to be considerate \u201cWe\u2019re just joking!\u201d And I was so angry I couldn\u2019t stop myself from saying \u201cThis is why I never come over you know? None of you can let me have one visit without being made fun of. You\u2019re worse than children.\u201d and left. \n\nApparently, after I left my mother cried for hours, and my sisters and dad have been blowing up my phone for ruining her birthday over a joke, and demanding I apologize. I do feel bad about making her upset, but why am I the only one being called to apologize? Which is why I\u2019m dragging my feet.

I\u2019m going to be very honest with you, you strike me as someone who has a lot of unresolved conflict with them to the point where it affects your daily life. It also sounds like you have some sibling rivalry going on that maybe your parents didn\u2019t correct or intervene with soon enough when you grew up together.

Listen to their responses or what ever reasoning they give you but continue to tell them that this seriously crosses a boundary for you.\n\nPeople don\u2019t always get things right the first time.

I would say if you do decide to start a relationship with her that is separate, start with some boundaries and ask her to not put you in a position or ask you to spend time with the rest of your family. Tell her that you're feeling hurt and need time to decide what you want your relationship with the rest of them to look like or if you want a relationship with them at all. Make it clear that if you someday choose to open that door again you will come to her, not the other way around. I would also suggest you go into a meeting with your mom having already planned some things to say about her behavior as well. Maybe that you understand it can be hard to talk back to people and go against the norm especially family, but it hurts when she doesn't defend you or ask them stop their behavior and remind her that you are her family too and having someone in your corner would make you feel more welcome and at peace? I don't want to assume how you're feeling, I just always find if I plan what I'm going to say a little before these types of interactions I tend to get my point across better and people understand me more. I can get emotional if I don't plan what I say and then I can't describe my feelings or perspective as well.\n\nAll in all you are NTA and I'm sorry you're going through this.

You don't need to apologize to her, you just need to tell her why you left and what it's gonna take for you all to really \"meet half-way.\" You also need her to tell them THEY ruined the party because they're jokes were what drove you out of it. It's not like you stormed off in the middle of nothing. Whether these were actually harmless jokes in their eyes or their way of meeting you 'half-way' doesn't really matter, what matters is that they don't know when to stop and you told them multiple times when they should have.\n\nHowever, a word of advice, OP and to many others: stop engaging with people like this. If they don't respect you from the get-go, they're not gonna respect a desire to change the subject or move on. Do not show your annoyance or anger at them -- don't ask them to change the subject, just change it and if they persist, keep greyrocking them.

Only matters when HER feeling get hurt. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going no contact with you all\u2026 oh what?? Haha it\u2019s just a joke? You\u2019re all so sensitive\u201d -blocked all contacts.", "NTA they are all assholes and don't apologise and if mom was crying for hours she's needs therapy. \n\nTell them this wouldn't happen if they weren't all so intent on harassing you. Tell them who you fuck is none of their business be blunt from now on. Ask why who you have in your bed is any of their business and if you did you certainly won't want them around people who use the excuses of jokes to be nasty and cruel for their amusement. Just like bullies do.", "NTA. You are in no way in the wrong, and what you said was correct. They cajoled you into coming and then treated you like a punching bag. If your mother wants to blame anyone for ruining her birthday, she needs to blame her daughters for picking on you and piling on, her husband for adding to the pile, and herself for tolerating it and laughing.", "NTA but as a fellow ace I find people stop inviting me to events I don't want to attend by making the same level of \"jokes\" that they do.\n\n\"How's dating going OP?\"\n\n\"Great! You won't believe how many smart and interesting people exist when you don't settle in high school.\"\n\nTurns out when you make similar jokes, they suddenly don't become funny.", "NTA as someone who was labelled as being \u2018too sensitive\u2019 by my family, I found therapy was really useful for me to use to find out if I was the problem, or if it was them not respecting my boundaries and gaslighting me etc. Essentially\u2026not telling you to do anything, I think you walking out was fine, I understand the guilty feeling, your mum not being strong enough to say something shows a lack in her but how you want to decide to deal with this is up to you. I do 100% recommend going to a therapist (one that you vibe with that you like and had a good approach) to help you understand yourself better so in the future if you do something you can know 100% you did the right thing even if it was the painful thing or on the flip side if you should return and respond differently.", "NTA they ruined her birthday not you", "NTA. They are not joking, they are toxic and bigoted. \n\n> you won\u2019t meet us halfway\n\nYou do not have to meet halfway with bigots. EVER. \n\nNTA. \n\nYou're only TA to yourself if you DONT go NC.", "Your mother was not \"crying for hours\" this is more emotional manipulation from them, no one cries for hours. NTA OP, your family sucks ass.", "Nta, thought you said family? This ain't family. They might have DNA shared  with you, but this ain't family. Call your mom, say if she wants to meet ans have a thing ok, your not apologizing, but since she wasn't part of the fuckery you will see her. And explain your no talking to sisters or dad again. Go nc. If she can't handle that, then she's nc as well. You can have boundaries. You should have boundaries.  You do not nope toxic people shit.", "EXACTLY THIS", "IDK, this sounds like the sort of dynamic where OP would show up to what he thought would be a dinner out with just himself and his mother, to find that the others were waiting in ambush.", "My mother usually doesn\u2019t say much I think she finds it distasteful, but also hates rocking the boat. When I was growing up, my mother and I were incredibly close, she let me play with her make up, (as long as I didn\u2019t tell dad) and took me to see the movies I wanted to that dad said were \u201ctoo sick\u201d (Before anyone gets ideas about what that means think \u201cThe Final Destination\u201d).   \n\nI remember once, I had been crying, I was probably about 15-16 because my father, in front of his friends, started talking about how \u201cnormal boys\u201d have pictures of women on their walls, but no, his little weirdo (I can\u2019t remember the exact wording but something like little weirdo), has dead people on his walls- makes him wonder what I do with them.   \n\nMy mom found me crying outside and comforted me, and defended me to dad after she heard what he said, said it was too far, and gross to say that. And that he should be happy I didn\u2019t have pictures of naked girls on my walls, Since I was a good Christian boy (lol).   \n\nSo I guess I kind of hoped she would do that all the time, or try to stop him, but she doesn\u2019t. And it hurts. I know that may be unfair, as I\u2019m just visiting and she has to live with him, but it doesn\u2019t change how I feel.", "People who continue to make \"jokes\" about finding OP a partner after being asked not to multiple times, implying that there's something wrong with being happily single ARE bullies - they clearly don't care about OPs comfort and wellbeing. Why should he have to compromise with people that don't show the slightest respect for his very reasonable desires? It's not a compromise because what are they giving up in order to make him happy? Absolutely nothing. Accepting someone for who they are is not a \"compromise\", it's called not being an asshole.", "Thankfully, I know to keep distance from those who \"can't\" see bullying for what it is or try to defend it.\n\nA good joke in good faith shouldn't be making anyone feel like shit. And if it does, the only reasonable response is an apology.\n\nMaking jokes you know will upset someone = bullying.", "Good job no one outside of people on Reddit would see this as bullying then. They\u2019re not even making jokes at OP\u2019s expense, just using lighthearted humour to approach the subject presumably because they\u2019re worried about OP\u2019s outbursts.\n\nI\u2019ve got a feeling there aren\u2019t many things that won\u2019t upset OP in the first place. I guess everything is bullying him, all the time", "were you at this dinner table as well? \ud83d\ude02"]}
