Of course, I (25M) am always seen as being sensitive or starting fights, because I was never the right kind of son for them. \n\nMy two older sisters, who I will call Amy, (f29) and Brit (f32) are exactly the kind of kids my parents wanted, married before they were out of high school, baby on the way before the year was out, church every Sunday, whatever. \n\nI on the other hand am aro/ace, an atheist, and a heathen to them, because of my job (which I prefer not to talk about here, as it\u2019s rather revealing).\n\nLike I said before I don\u2019t go to family gatherings often, because of how \u201cfunny\u201d everyone is. But, recently was my mother's birthday, and I was guilted into going by my dad because in his words \u201cwe always tried our best to understand you, and you won\u2019t meet us halfway-\u201c and that she really missed me. Which all felt manipulative to me, but whatever.\n\nI went, I brought a gift (some glass figurines from a collection she loves) and braced for the worst.\n\nSurprisingly everything went well, at first, there were jokes thrown but nothing that really bothered me, so it was fine. Then Brit said something like; \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll ask the question if everyone else is too scared, how\u2019s dating going, Op?\u201d And laughed. \n\nI didn\u2019t want things to devolve so I just smiled and said something like \u201cGood as ever, how\u2019s your husband doing?\u201d \n\nBut she didn\u2019t drop it, and laughed again, offering to set me up with a girl from church, saying maybe she could \u201cscrew my head on right\u201d \n\nAt which point I got very angry and asked to change the subject. \n\nMy other sister asked if I really wasn\u2019t worried about being alone, and said that she just wanted someone to be there to take care of me.\n\nI told her I could take care of myself, I really wanted to change the subject. \n\nMy father butted in that everyone should calm down, because he knows I\u2019m just looking for the right woman, to make an honest man out of me, and laughed, along with everyone else at the table, frankly, I felt humiliated and just wanted to get away from these people. \n\nSo I stood up, and made my way to the door, my mother following me the whole way, asking me to be considerate \u201cWe\u2019re just joking!\u201d And I was so angry I couldn\u2019t stop myself from saying \u201cThis is why I never come over you know? None of you can let me have one visit without being made fun of. You\u2019re worse than children.\u201d and left. \n\nApparently, after I left my mother cried for hours, and my sisters and dad have been blowing up my phone for ruining her birthday over a joke, and demanding I apologize. I do feel bad about making her upset, but why am I the only one being called to apologize? Which is why I\u2019m dragging my feet. If I\u2019m the AH I\u2019ll apologize and try to move past it, but I really don\u2019t understand how I\u2019m the one in the wrong?
