{"id": 11206, "submission_id": "11f5yjn", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum March 2023: Rule 11", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n\nThis month, we\u2019re diving into all things rule 11. It\u2019s one of our broadest rules, and often one of the most misunderstood.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most common question - isn\u2019t every post on this sub about some type of relationship? Yes, of course. One of the basic requirements of this sub is to post about interpersonal conflicts. And those typically don\u2019t exist without some type of relationship (barring the random encounter with a stranger on the street, etc.).\n\nWhat we look at is the nature of the relationship. When reviewing a post for rule 11, we ask ourselves if the conflict could exist outside the confines of a romantic relationship. Can this conflict exist between two friends, roommates, family members? If the answer is no, then it\u2019s a rule 11 violation. A post about buying an engagement ring, considering a divorce/break-up, \u201ccatching feelings\u201d for someone, romantic jealousy, dating, engaging in sexual acts, etc. are part of this rule. Choosing to not do any of the aforementioned also qualifies. \n\nu/CutlassKitty gave a fantastic example in Januray\u2019s Open Forum that sums this part of the rule up nicely:\n > So \"AITA for telling my boyfriend to clean up after himself\" is allowed because it isn't about the relationship itself. But \"AITA for wanting affection from my partner\" isnt.\n\nBorrowing from another user\u2019s examples, u/stannenb gave this, also in January\u2019s Open Forum:\n> I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination. I've told my spouse if they have to indulge in something demonic like that, do it outside the home. AITA?\n> I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination. I've told my spouse that if they indulge in something demonic like that, I'm going to leave them. AITA? \n> The first conflict, about pineapple pizza within a relationship, is fine.\n> The second conflict is about ending the relationship because of pineapple pizza and would be removed.\n\nHowever, rule 11 does not solely cover romantic relationships. It also covers cutting contact with/ghosting others. That includes family members and friends. Disclosing details of cheating also is covered and is often a reason for a post removal. \n\nReproductive autonomy decisions, such as having a child (or not), keeping the pregnancy (or not), and adoption also fall under rule 11. We have included situations about who to allow in a delivery room under this umbrella, as these conflicts regularly lead to breakups/divorce or involve threats for the same.\n\n\nYou might be asking \u201cWhy aren\u2019t these topics allowed here?\u201d There\u2019s a couple answers to that question. One is that 99% of these questions are essentially about consent. We all recognize that anyone has the right to revoke consent at any time, whether that\u2019s in direct relation to sex or just in terms of staying in contact with someone, or anything in between. This isn\u2019t a matter that we can give moral judgement on; we simply cannot condone allowing a post where people tell someone they were wrong to exercise their right to consent. Another answer is that Reddit is a big place, and there are a ton of subs dedicated to relationships, etc. The answer there is simple - we have no interest in being another relationship sub. r/findareddit is a great resource if you\u2019re not sure which sub is a good fit for your post.\n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

In the pineapple pizza example you provide, is the addition of \u201cI\u2019m going to leave them\u201d really enough to merit removing the post? The underlying conflict is the same \u2014 all that is different is the OP\u2019s proposed action to take in response.\n\nThere was a post today that was removed for Rule 11 where the OP was discussing her boyfriend\u2019s misogyny (he referred to her as a \u201clittle girl\u201d when discussing a time when she was in college), and many commenters were discussing how his comments were red flags about his attitudes towards women and about consent in general. These are the kinds of discussions I see all the time on this subreddit, and I don\u2019t see how the specific context of them being in a romantic relationship invalidates that entire discussion. People say things like \u201cyou should leave that narcissist\u201d all the time in posts that aren\u2019t removed, so clearly if the goal is to keep the forum from commenting on people\u2019s relationship status, then that goal is not being realized.", "Is something broken? It looks like the timebot forgot to put the thread out of contest mode.", "Conversely, that one about the guy who was giving too much support to his best friend and neglecting his fianc\u00e9e was very, very relationship-centric. There was no way that conflict would have happened without them being in a romantic relationship and that wasn't removed.\n\nETA: thought I should add that my point was that even with that justification for the rule, it doesn't seem to really be applied consistently.", "What's with all the posts about cruises all of a sudden?", "What happened to best of 2022? I don't think we ever voted on the nominations", "There are over 30 active mods here so it's super hard to respond to a specific removal, but let me try to generally explain. \n\nFirst, let me say this was not one of our initial rules. It was one that was *overwhelmingly* requested by the sub because of the redundancy with other subs.\n\nTo the main point, relationship posts can be broadly divided into two categories - I want to maintain this relationship, or I don't. If you don't, who cares? Wash your hands of it and move on. If you want to unpack what went wrong and how to avoid it, you're asking for advice - go an advice sub. It's not a judgement issue.\n\nIf you do want to maintain the relationship.... how do I put this? I'd ask any of you to go to your SO and say \"Honey, I asked the internet about our spat earlier and they said you're an asshole!\" and see how that works out for you.  \nI'm a decade and a half into my relationship with my husband. We have both been the asshole at times. There's no victory in being \"not the asshole.\" There's only hopefully a comfortable resolution. To use a lighthearted example from a thread I was just participating in, my husband is a scream sneezer and I hate it. I bet most people would agree he's TA for not covering his fucking mouth when he sneezes after three years of a global pandemic but, what am I going to do? Dump him? Show him a reddit thread like he gives a shit about some randos opinions? - ***or** - would I be better suited seeking advice on how to express to him how much that bothers me and how best to find a reasonable compromise like him walking to another room to unleash the germ beast?\n\nThat's the crux- there is absolutely nothing to be gained by playing a \"who's right\" game with a relationship you value. There's everything to be gained by understanding the other party's perspective and, even if you don't agree, having that inform your path to resolution. And there are a multitude of subs that exist for exactly that purpose.\n\nI will also add (and I said this in the last OF so sorry for being redundant) - we're constantly bringing on new mods and this is one that a lot of new mods get wrong. There's coaching happening in the background you may not see. We make bad calls sometimes, but we're not like \"meh, whatever\" about it.", "Definitely the same troll for most of them.", "My personal take -   \n\n\nI'd argue that if you add \"I'm going to leave them\" the underlying conflict is NOT the same. So I fundamentally disagree with that premise. Arguing about how to use a shared living space is not the same as whether or not someone is \"allowed\" to break up with someone/not date them.  \n\n\nI'd also argue romantic relationships as a whole have greater subjectivity to \"right or wrong\" than other interpersonal relationships largely due to the nature of the relevance of consent (or advice) as mentioned before. People can have all sorts of wacky criteria for what they want, don't want, or would have as a requirement or dealbreaker in a romantic relationship everyone involves consents to. And at the end of the day, those conflicts aren't about the rightness or wrongness of moral actions, but rather compatibility. Someone can have the most random, what I think of as bizarre requirement for their willingness to be in a romantic relationship, and no matter how strange I might find it, it's not morally right or wrong for them to have that. It might mean they choose not to date someone or someone chooses not to date them, but someone genuinely can decide they would never date someone who eats pineapple.   \n\n\nSo those conflicts tend to either come down to \"This is a fundamental incompatibility\" or \"You are looking for advice on how to navigate this conflict\", as opposed to anything inherently right or wrong to an action. Romantic relationships are a different type of interpersonal contract than other relationships.   \n\n\nIt's not morally right or wrong to choose not to date someone who eats pineapple pizza. That's why it wouldn't be a good fit for this sub. Conflict between individuals about what is allowed in their shared living space is different than asking if someone is right or wrong to not want to date someone who eats pineapple pizza.   \n\n\nIn essence, it's never \"wrong\" for someone to choose not to consent to a romantic relationship / remove previous consent (ie break up).", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041a4g/aita_best_of_2022_masster_post/", "If a post gets removed while it's still in contest mode, then it will stay in contest mode even when the normal time frame goes by.", "That and the creep apologist, both been spamming the sub the last few days...", "ah, I thought those were just nominations and the voting would be in a google form. oh well. gives me more stuff to read", "He has a tell. It's been automodded.", "Yeah the structure, style and verbiage is very obvious with that one.

A better course of action would be to contact us so we can add to that doc and catch them easier instead of alerting trolls to the fact we know they're trolls.
