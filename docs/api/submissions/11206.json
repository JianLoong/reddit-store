Rules still apply.\n\n\nThis month, we\u2019re diving into all things rule 11. It\u2019s one of our broadest rules, and often one of the most misunderstood.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most common question - isn\u2019t every post on this sub about some type of relationship? Yes, of course. One of the basic requirements of this sub is to post about interpersonal conflicts. And those typically don\u2019t exist without some type of relationship (barring the random encounter with a stranger on the street, etc.).\n\nWhat we look at is the nature of the relationship. When reviewing a post for rule 11, we ask ourselves if the conflict could exist outside the confines of a romantic relationship. Can this conflict exist between two friends, roommates, family members? If the answer is no, then it\u2019s a rule 11 violation. A post about buying an engagement ring, considering a divorce/break-up, \u201ccatching feelings\u201d for someone, romantic jealousy, dating, engaging in sexual acts, etc. are part of this rule. Choosing to not do any of the aforementioned also qualifies. \n\nu/CutlassKitty gave a fantastic example in Januray\u2019s Open Forum that sums this part of the rule up nicely:\n > So \"AITA for telling my boyfriend to clean up after himself\" is allowed because it isn't about the relationship itself. But \"AITA for wanting affection from my partner\" isnt.\n\nBorrowing from another user\u2019s examples, u/stannenb gave this, also in January\u2019s Open Forum:\n> I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination. I've told my spouse if they have to indulge in something demonic like that, do it outside the home. AITA?\n> I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination. I've told my spouse that if they indulge in something demonic like that, I'm going to leave them. AITA? \n> The first conflict, about pineapple pizza within a relationship, is fine.\n> The second conflict is about ending the relationship because of pineapple pizza and would be removed.\n\nHowever, rule 11 does not solely cover romantic relationships. It also covers cutting contact with/ghosting others. That includes family members and friends. Disclosing details of cheating also is covered and is often a reason for a post removal. \n\nReproductive autonomy decisions, such as having a child (or not), keeping the pregnancy (or not), and adoption also fall under rule 11. We have included situations about who to allow in a delivery room under this umbrella, as these conflicts regularly lead to breakups/divorce or involve threats for the same.\n\n\nYou might be asking \u201cWhy aren\u2019t these topics allowed here?\u201d There\u2019s a couple answers to that question. One is that 99% of these questions are essentially about consent. We all recognize that anyone has the right to revoke consent at any time, whether that\u2019s in direct relation to sex or just in terms of staying in contact with someone, or anything in between. This isn\u2019t a matter that we can give moral judgement on; we simply cannot condone allowing a post where people tell someone they were wrong to exercise their right to consent. Another answer is that Reddit is a big place, and there are a ton of subs dedicated to relationships, etc. The answer there is simple - we have no interest in being another relationship sub. r/findareddit is a great resource if you\u2019re not sure which sub is a good fit for your post.\n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\n**We\u2019re currently looking for mods with Typescript experience.**\n\nWe always need US overnight time mods.

In the pineapple pizza example you provide, is the addition of \u201cI\u2019m going to leave them\u201d really enough to merit removing the post? The underlying conflict is the same \u2014 all that is different is the OP\u2019s proposed action to take in response.\n\nThere was a post today that was removed for Rule 11 where the OP was discussing her boyfriend\u2019s misogyny (he referred to her as a \u201clittle girl\u201d when discussing a time when she was in college), and many commenters were discussing how his comments were red flags about his attitudes towards women and about consent in general. These are the kinds of discussions I see all the time on this subreddit, and I don\u2019t see how the specific context of them being in a romantic relationship invalidates that entire discussion. People say things like \u201cyou should leave that narcissist\u201d all the time in posts that aren\u2019t removed, so clearly if the goal is to keep the forum from commenting on people\u2019s relationship status, then that goal is not being realized."]}
