If you have factored a loan to cover the cost of IVF into your monthly budget and find enough to still cover the bills and essentials for them and a baby, than it\u2019s doable. \n\nAlthough I agree a better way may be to save that payment to pay for IVF outright, sometimes people are aged out of that option. If they didn\u2019t start trying for children until their mid 30s, didn\u2019t get diagnosed with fertility issues until 2 years later, they would be close to 40 before knowing they needed to save. Depending on income, they could be too old to consider IVF before they save enough, so a loan would work.
