Mary works for a local pizza place to help supplement some income. \n\nOn my way back from a doctor appointment, I received a call from Mary. She was asking if I'd reconsider being their nanny so she could get a full time job because they can't afford child care. When I explained that it would be very difficult because of my appointments, all I got was a \"I was afraid you'd say that.\" We hung up and I didn't hear anything else.\n\nA few hours later, I got a text in a group message with my Mom, Mary, and I. \"We need to discuss childcare. I talked to both of you separately but we need to figure SOMETHING out. I HAVE to get a job or we risk losing our house.\" I haven't responded because I already know I will end up saying something I'll regret. My instant first thought was \"Why is it up to Mom and I??

Even at 23, I view 19 year olds as basically children and I feel bad that she\u2019s in this situation years later.\n\nThat aside NTA, I\u2019m sure she can find a sitter/nanny for a reasonable price.

My brother has explicitly told me he has no interest in ever babysitting said future kid, and I have no plans to guilt trip him into it. He doesn't want to, and he doesn't have to, as simple as that. \nParents are obligated to figure Something out, you are clearly not a part of that equation, it's not fair to you, her, or the kids to keep trying to wear you down. If she wasn't ready to pay for childcare, she shouldn't have had children. it's harsh, but as simple as that. Kids are expensive little beasts. She needs to find another option. It exists, she's just looking for the \"easy\" way out, not the right way. Don't back down.", "NTA parents expecting other people to care and provide for their children is keeping AITA going these days.\n\nDid your sister sit down with you and your mom to figure out whether she should go ahead and have each of her children? Did you have a say then?", "NTA...don't get guilted or tricked into doing this. Her kids, her responsibility.", "NTA\n\nMaybe suggest Sister get a job at a Day Care Center.  Both my daughters work at one (different cities) and are offered a huge discount for their own children to attend. And,  the longer they are there,  the bigger the discount.

She wasn't planning on paying them at all.", "In this case, he's being kicked out bc 10 years is the max his rank is allowed to be in.

So, he\u2019ll be eligible for retirement and able to take care of the kids himself, or he\u2019ll be able to look for a job then.\n\nDepending on what he did in the military, it\u2019s super common to end up working for a defense contractor. Way back when I worked for one it was super common to see someone go on terminal leave and then show back up, usually with new facial hair, as either a direct Defense employee or working as a civilian. \n\nIt seems like they just need to do some better planning for that transition. NTA.", "In this case NTA. Why isn\u2019t he looking for another job? If your sister is about to be locked out of her house, it sounds like they\u2019ve been in a bad financial situation for a while. Husband need to find a new job and they may have to move somewhere cheaper. Lots of call centers also hire full time from home so your sister could do that.", "You really need to change this wording than.

That seems like it should be something that's immediate.", "Taking on someone else\u2019s financial needs is not a favor.  That\u2019s a whole responsibility.   Sister losing their house is not OP\u2019s responsibility.  Sister and husband are responsible for their life choices.  OP is responsible for their life choices.", "And it sounds like OP has her own needs that need to be focused on and addressed.

Not daycare, but an individual nanny arrangement. Tell them you expect the same amount from them before you would even consider it.

He likely isn\u2019t progressing in rank so they aren\u2019t going to allow him to re-up. \n\nOP, a lot of military jobs can translate to civilian work. He needs to start working on that like yesterday. Now, not all do. My husband\u2019s MOS doesn\u2019t have a civilian equivalent. (Not a lot of tanks to shoot missiles at outside of the military.) But places like the VA will a lot of times hire veterans with a somewhat similar job. I used to love talking to the people at the VA I used to have to go to for work. They always were telling me that my husband should go work there and how they were sure they could find a job that his MOS could match up with, until I told them what he did. But it is still an option.", "Paperwork my friend. Lots of i\u2019s to dot and t\u2019s to cross on that sort of thing."]}
