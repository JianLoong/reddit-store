Trying to say that it wasn\u2019t her moms choice, non of her business, she was ruining her family and trying to control her ability to have children etc.\n\nHun, if you are planning another baby with the idea that someone else will look after them, you better include them in the conversation.", "Either honorable discharge or dishonorable discharge....\n\nAnd why the mom always have to take care all the childcare when the father is present...what did the father did? Juggling his balls?", "Also why is the sister not sending that message to her HUSBAND? NTA.", "Why can\u2019t military dad look after them once he\u2019s kicked out? Presumably they don\u2019t stop your pay until you actually leave, so he should be there when she needs to go to work?", "I was \"kicked out\" due to \"downsizing\" and it's way cheaper than the medical retirement I deserved. Still though, if it's something like that you get an honorable discharge, a settlement of sorts, depending on your job, and a bunch of notice. Like, enough notice to attend a ton of classes about how not to be a failure as a civilian lol", "It was my understanding that if one was actually kicked out of the military one wouldn't get prior notice, at least not two months worth. Is his contract ending and he's choosing not to re-up it?", "Maybe he's getting kicked out because he was doing that in front of his commanding officer.", "We did this as well. We called it tag team parenting.", "Exactly I worked around My husbands job so one of us was always home with the kids. Was it crap going to work at the weekends and taking double time ever holiday throughout the year. Leaving whilst they all sat and watched cartoons or films while having a slow breakfast, yes. Especially as my days home with them we always had to be out early and do school runs etc and run about but that life sometimes. We took responsibility for our own children and finances.\n\nAs upsetting as it is he needs to get a new job and they need to work around each other. If they can\u2019t afford their house then they need to downgrade. It\u2019s not nice but it\u2019s life and they should not just push their responsibilities on OP.", "This is what my husband and I did before my daughter started school. Now I work when she\u2019s in school. Some people seem to think that their problems should be everyone else\u2019s problems because, you know\u2026\u2026family. OP you are NTA", "I purposely wfh so that we can have child care while my fiance works out of the home.", "Yeah, I am curious to know what her husband will do all day while she works, mom and OP watch the kids.", "Yup, I think the response should have been:\n\n\u201cHey sis, I think you meant to sent this to your husband. Sorry I can\u2019t help beyond once in a blue moon or in an emergency.\u201d\n\nNTA", "I want to phrase this kindly - what this means is he\u2019s failed to promote at the expected rate.  This can happen because he\u2019s been demoted one or more times (due to discipline issues), or he didn\u2019t complete the required training/ promotion boards to advance at the normal promotion rate.  (Apologies if you are not in the US - it\u2019s different in each country, I\u2019m sure).", "So they knew it was going to happen and they did nothing to prepare for that ?  \nAnd know they want to make it like it's your responsibility to take of their child ?\n\nNTA obviously", "Yet to a get to a longterm solution, she needs help in the short-term!\n\nStill the arsehole imo.", "Lol\n\nIf you get kicked out of military, you fucked up enough they don't want to deal with you.\n\nIts not the same as an honorable discharge, where you'd be receiving some type of benefits for your service.\n\nOPs BIL did something bad, and now that he's jobless he can care for the kids while mom works.", "It can actually take a lot longer then two months to kick someone out of the military", "Having not been military this is what I took out of it. Even grunts can retire into recruiting HS students.", "I'm not saying that a dishonorable discharge isn't bad I just am unaware if they would let him do two more months before it kicked in. I thought that anyone dishonorably discharged was pretty quickly kicked out.", "This! Also, if husband has GI bill benefits, 10 years in should get them 4 years of college. They pay a stipend for housing and this may very well help the family out. He can even take online classes and take over the household, while the sister goes to work full-time.", "Military moves on sloth time. Quite possible he is getting a dishonorable discharge and it\u2019s taking 2 months to got though the process. Like he did something and they know it\u2019s coming.  Even getting out for medical issues that are significant can take over a year. Every process I\u2019ve seen takes months and months. My son got married and it took over 6 months for BAH to start. Just one example, there were more. It boggled my mind.\nETA the discharge date can change, too, to sooner or later than whatever date they have been told. At the drop of a dime!", "Administrative separations can take some time.\n\nIt's also possible they won't let him reenlist because he didn't promote.", "Huh very strange. I know plenty of government agencies need to update from the slow moving paper trail systems that worked before the digital era maybe that's the case here too.", "6mo for BAH? I call bullshit."]}
