She was supposed to pick it up over the weekend, but I asked if she could take our daughter 'Erin' (10F) to her soccer game (it was my weekend) because something came up for me (friend's event).\n\nBecause she was able to take Erin for a day I said she could pick up the boxes on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nLuna offered to pick them up this Friday instead, and said she had a big case at work, and a PTA meeting for Erin's school and couldn't do it those days.\n\nI was kind of frustrated and really getting sick of her junk cluttering up the place.\nI called her today (Thursday) to see if she could come pick it up, but she was at work and couldn't even come during her lunch break because of the case.\n\nI really didn't want her stuff in my home anymore, so I had her boxes delivered to her office.\nI was still annoyed that she didn't ever pick them up, and kept making excuses, but I figured this was a perfectly reasonable response, since I shouldn't have to drive them all the way out to her since she was supposed to pick them up, BUT I could get them out of my home and I knew she would have been really upset if the boxes were just sitting outside her place all day while she was at work.\n\nLuna's mom called me just now, and said it was incredibly rude of me to send them to her office, and I'd interrupted a client meeting because she had to leave to sign for the package.\n\nI explained that Luna has made so many excuses for not picking up her stuff, and I wanted it out, and since clearly Luna liked to spend time at the office so much, I may as well send them there. \nShe told me she was glad her daughter was leaving me and told me to stop ruining her life, and that I was making her look bad at work, and being petty then hung up on me.\n\nWas I the asshole here for sending my wife's belongings to her workplace?\n\nUPDATE/INFO\nWe couldn't agree on having another kid or not.\nI wanted another kid and she wanted to focus on her career and said she didn't have time for one now.\n\nWe were on thin ice there for a while and were trying to fix things and discuss but the magic was gone and I know by the time she reaches what she wants with her career she will likely be too old to have more children. \n\nI started having feelings for someone else (nothing physical ever happened) and we split up when I admitted this to her. No one had any affairs however and she said she agreed maybe we should be seeing  other people instead too and that we wanted such different things. \nAs amicable as it should have been given the circumstances.", "created_utc": 1674760780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lzyp5/aita_for_sending_my_wifes_belongings_to_her_office/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why not drop them off to her apartment when she\u2019s home? Why not make the exchange when she is picking up your daughter? Why go out of your way to embarrass her at work?", "YTA I think her Mum might be on to something. Like the woman has been gone for a week, give her a chance. This is not a long period of time to wait. So yeah sending them to her office because you can't wait is incredibly petty.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t get her belongings from your house over the weekend because you couldn\u2019t be bother to take care of your child on your assigned weekend so she had to. Then she had commitments already scheduled for the days you wanted her to change to (one of those also being for your child!). So waiting until Friday (ONE more day) was so bothersome that you interrupt her at work?  You changed the original plan to go to your friends \u201cevent\u201d. You are the AH. She\u2019s lucky to be rid of you.", "YTA. Simple as that. That was some Petty Labelle shit.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine why she\u2019s divorcing you.", "YTA - And perhaps we see WHY you are getting divorced.", "YTA, she just moved out, it's not like she's been blowing it off for months. Speak of blowing things off... Let's talk about you blowing off your child's game for a friend's event. That alone makes you TA", "Wow YTA. Guess you don't want a civil separation do you? You sent her personal belongings to her office, alerting other employees and clients of her personal situation. She was busy and planned to pick her stuff up, but you just couldn't be an adult and wait until she did. It seems like you either did this to humiliate her or because you're insanely immature.", "YTA - she didn't pick them up last weekend because she was doing you a favor on your weekend with the kid.  Today is Thursday, you couldn't wait until the weekend for her to pick up the boxes????  Not to mention sending that sort of stuff to her office is NEVER okay.", "YTA. **She literally said she can pick it up on Friday. She also offered to take it at a different date but was doing YOU a favour.** I'm sorry but a big work case and something related to your daughter aren't 'excuses'. You did this to be petty and humiliate her.\n\nCould you not wait one day?", "Lol YTA you are an unbelievable asshole", "YTA it's literally been what, like a couple weeks? She's obviously busy. Couldn't you have put it into the garage (assuming you've got one) or offer to bring it to her new place at a time that would be convenient for both of you? I understand that this is a difficult time, but it would be better to be civil and try to help each other for your daughter, if for no one else.", "YTA. You acted impulsively and sent your wife's belongings to her office without considering the potential consequences. Your wife is understandably upset that you sent her belongings to her workplace, interrupting her work and potentially making her look bad in front of her colleagues and clients. While you may have been frustrated with your wife's delays or what you call \u201cexcuses\u201d in picking up her belongings, it would have been more appropriate to discuss the situation with her and come to a compromise or find another solution.", "Oh my gosh. You are not only the AH, you are the SuperAH! YTA!", "YTA. You couldn't wait an extra day for her to pick up her stuff? She only moved out last week, and it sounds like her life is busy and stressful. She gave you a reasonable date and I can't see what the problem is. It sounds like you just did this out of spite, and forced her to bring a personal problem into work. Personally, I would be really humiliated to have all my colleagues and clients see manifestations of my private personal problems.", "YTA You both had an agreement and you changed it. She would have gotten everything had you not asked her to cover for you. She did you a favor, and yeah, it was nice that you said she could come later, but then you got mad and impatient because she couldn't come on the days **you** wanted. Friday was an absolutely reasonable request.", "YTA. Taking out your personal and intimate relationship conflicts out on your wife in her professional environment is massive AH behavior. You know you should have left her workplace out of it, but you wanted to rub salt in the wound, didn\u2019t you?", "YTA - The move was 7 days prior. Your expectations were unreasonable.  You created disruption & drama in her life; an ahole move.", "Are you for real?\n\nShe couldn't take her stuff because YOU rescheduled.\n\nWonder why you're divorcing /s", "YTA. It\u2019s been a week. And she already helped you out by taking Erin to soccer. Thank God she\u2019s getting a divorce. You sound intolerable just by posting less than 1000 words", "YTA\n\nYou couldn't wait one more day for her to get them? Don't be surprised if she plays petty games in return. You're also setting an example of acceptable behavior for your kid and this isn't it.", "YTA\n\nYou are the reason she didn't pick the stuff up in the first place because you decided to go hang out with a friend instead of taking your daughter to her soccer game\n\nAnd then, instead of just being a decent human being and waiting for her to have time (come on..it wasn't that much clutter) you decided to be petty\n\nThe sad reality is, this makes YOU look bad...not your wife\n\nNow everyone will assume the reason the marriage ended was because of you.  And even if that is not the case...or it was a mutually toxic thing...everyone will now take her side\n\nThe narrative now is that you blew off spending time with your daughter to go hang out with a friend and you did something petty in an attempt to make your wife look bad\n\nYou really didn't think this through did you?", "YTA, of course. Your wife did you a favour by dropping your daughter off so you could go to a friend\u2019s event, gave you an alternative time she could pick her stuff up, and because you couldn\u2019t wait a couple of extra days, you chose to embarrass her at work. \n\nShocked that you couldn\u2019t keep your marriage together.", "YTA 100%.\n\nIf you had given her months and months to figure it out, than yeah this would be acceptable. But she literally moved out last week and she is obviously very busy with work.", "YTA-you did this entirely to try to embarrass her at work.", "YTA. It's your fault she wasn't able to pick them up as planned. And if you simply HAVE to get rid of them, just send them to where she is living now.", "OMG - I honestly can't believe that you think this was OK. YTA in a BIG way. The reason that you couldn't have put her boxes in the garage until she could pick them up was what, exactly What if she hadn't told anyone at work that you're splitting up? If you're still working things out, the house is still hers, until paperwork is signed - so technically the boxes were in her house. YOU asked her to take your daughter to the game on the day she was going to pick up the boxes and then only gave her a couple of weekdays to pick them up instead of the weekend? Get real, and grow up.", "YTA and clearly bitter", "YTA.\n\nTo you, your friend's event is more important than your daughter's match. You also embarrassed your soon-to-be-ex-wife at work. No wonder you're getting divorced lmao", "YTA. YOU we\u2019re the reason the boxes were still there and I absolutely don\u2019t doubt that your poor attitude is the reason for the split. Your ex MIL is right, \u2018Luna\u2019 is better off without you.", "Yta, you took away her weekend because your plans were so important and now are trying to get her to do extra steps during a busy work week. She accommodated your schedule to care for your daughter and you won't wait a f***ing week for her to come get her things. You sent her stuff to her place of employment?? Seriously. I hope she takes you for everything you are worth.", "Absolutely unbelievable. YTA. She literally done you a favour instead of collecting her belongings and then you tried to dictate an alternative time that didn\u2019t suit her. I can\u2019t emphasise how much of TA you are tbh.", "YTA.  \n\nYeah, I'd pull this move if it had been a month or two of balderdash. That kind of petty would've been well earned.\n\nBut a week?  Jeebus on Toast Points!  She's still dealing with the chaos of the move, plus the things that came up during the week, and all because she rescheduled because of YOUR request over the weekend.\n\nLet that sink in.  YOUR request.  She did something to help YOU out, inconveniced herself because of YOU, and THIS how you repay her.\n\nDid you offer to take them over to help her, given that it was your request that caused the situation?  Oh, of course not.\n\nShe's well rid of you, and let me give you a straight up telling --  your daughter sees all of this kind of behavior.  Do you think Erin's going to want to spend time with a schmucknutz like you as soon as she turns 18 years old?\n\nStraighten up and fly right.", "I didn't need to read past the the first appointment you had for her to pick them up which YOU cancelled on her (you also cancelled on your daughter, nice) to go to a party or something.  You are the asshole.", "YTA\n\nSo the first time she didn't pick them up, she was doing you a favor. Then, she couldn't do it because of work. Both are reasonable. She offered to get her stuff on Friday, but apparently, that was just one day too late for you. You are a petty man, and I am not surprised you are getting a divorce.\n\nAlso, just a guess, but I have a feeling her job had been a point of contention in your marriage. You were doing this to be an AH, and you know it.", "YTA\n\nYou knew what you were doing. Stop trying to gaslight us. You changed the visitation arrangement. If it was that important, you could have sent the boxes to her house, her mom's house, drove the boxes to her house. You literally just sent them to her office to embarrass her and are now playing dumb when called out.", "YTA- so rather then take your kid you made your ex do it.  then you get snippy because she did not pick up her boxes fast enough after she had already told you why.\n\nYou are being petty, a few extra days would not make any difference and now chances of her playing nice during the divorce are pretty slim.", "YTA. Can you believe it? \n\nYou trade your daughter of for a meeting with friends and then are miffed about your ex-wife having work and commitments at your daughters school?\n\nYour wife seems have divorced the less mature child.", "YTA, and petty af.", "YTA, this is such a psycho move. You KNOW you embarrassed her publicly and professionally.", "YTA. You could have waited a bit more, not that difficult. She was correct that it was very rude to send them to her work place.", " YTA, come on. you would have had to wait maybe 24hrs max and saved a ton on shipping. if it's so few things that it can be so easily shipped like that, it can't be taking up that much space. this was clearly more of a power dynamic thing than about the actual stuff.", "And why are you splitting up? Oh, right YTA.", "YTA. So this is how it's going to be? She does something nice for you, and you repay her by harassing her and picking fights in front of her coworkers and clients?\n\nWell we know which of you is the crazy ex...", "So let me get this straight, she happily helped you out for something that came up on your time, and you couldn\u2019t give her some grace on getting the rest of her stuff? That she couldn\u2019t pick up bc she was busy helping you? Did I get that right? \n\nYTA, and honestly idk how helpful I\u2019d be in the future if that is the kind of response you find acceptable to a perfectly reasonable \u201cexcuse\u201d", "Whoa, this response after only a week? Am I ready that right? YTA.", "\"I really didn't want her stuff in my home anymore, so I had her boxes delivered to her office.\"\n\nYTA\n\nYou do know this will come up in the divorce proceedings, right?  And how childish this makes you look to the judge that will finalize visitation rights?  The division of assets, including the removal of personal affects takes time.  Sometimes  months or longer.  \n\nWe can see  why she's leaving you.  You just put it on display for all to see.", "YTA\n\nUntil the divorce is finalized and signed by a judge is still her house too regardless of the fact that she is allowing you to stay there, yu are lucky she even did that. Tbh at this point if I were her I would demand the sale of the house and the proceeds be split.", "YTA and a petty one at that.", "YTA. Tell me your bitter without telling me your bitter....", "YTA. Why could you not wait until Friday as she suggested. You shipping them to her office was a major d*ck move.", "So, she is kind enough to take your daughter when you have something come up, but you gave her less than a week to get all her things out of \u201cyour\u201d house? \n\nYeah, I think I can see why you\u2019re divorcing. \n\nYTA and I wish your STBXW the very best in her newfound freedom.", "So she did you a favor but you could not return it by waiting for Friday?  Of course YTA.", "YTA, can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019re getting divorced at all with you being such a \u201cnice\u201d guy and all.", "YTA this sounds like some weird power move trying to embarrass her at work. You couldn't ship them to her new place?", "YTA and her mom is right that you're being petty. She accommodated your plans and you can't even let her have her things in what has previously been her home for a couple of days because she's busy with WORK and your daughter's PTA MEETING (which why aren't you attending and let your ex pick up the things that night if it was so important?). There's no discussing it. The verdict is very clear.", "YTA. I can see why you are divorced. You really just screwed up as well. \u201cWe agreed I got the house\u201d is going to turn into \u201cshe took every penny I had\u201d real quick like now.", "YTA. This was petty and spiteful\u2026", "YTA. You just want to make her as miserable as you are.", "Lmao yeah i can see why she is divorcing you, you're sad and pathetic. Have fun living alone", "So you asked her a favor which prevented her from collecting the last of her things.\n\nThen she told you she could come on Friday (because your friends event was more important then taking care of your child) as she was working and going to a PTA Event (which you don\u2019t attend - interesting parenting choice there), and on Thursday (not even a week after the day she would have picked up her things if she hadn\u2019t generously done you a favor) you were just so sick of the things being there you delivered them to her work.\n\nJust own the fact you were hoping it would embarrass her or mess up her career and stop whinging on the internet.\n\nYTA\n\nAlso you lack poor critical thinking skills, have no desire to be a parent, and it\u2019s very easy to see why you got divorced.", "YTA, and I really wonder what the reason for your split is because based on what you wrote, you can be a real AH.", "YTA...you just embarrassed her in front of all her colleagues.\nNot weird you guys aren't married anymore\n\nShe needs to ten too you but if you have to wait it's a problem. Asshole for sure", "YTA. You are the reason the original plan didn't work out over the weekend it was initially arranged because **you wanted to go to a friend's event rather than have your day with your kid**. The short length of time you decided was reasonable  (it isn't) before shipping the boxes also makes you TA.", "YTA\n\nYou asked her for a favor the day she was supposed to get her stuff. So she couldn\u2019t get it that day.\n\nThen you are impatient and unwilling to wait a whole week for her next availability so you fuck with her stuff and her job. That\u2019s suuuuper AH behavior", "YTA. Dude by just reading over what you typed before posting it would make you conclude that YTA.", "YTA. \n\nYou are petty and sad. She did you a *favour* when she should have been picking up her things, and your new suggested time didn\u2019t work for her. You couldn\u2019t stand to look at the items for *one* more day, when you are the reason they hadn\u2019t already been picked up, so you sent them to her place of work, probably making her look bad in front of clients and coworkers and really throwing her off for the rest of the day. **Grow up.**", "YTA. You are finalizing the details of your divorce. The whole thing is gonna be over soon. A sign of maturity would be to allow her to pick up her items when it is convenient for her within 30 days.\n\nIf the boxes have been there for five months then OK I get it you\u2019re tired of looking at them. However , Right now, as much as you don\u2019t want them there, you\u2019re just making yourself look bad but refusing to be reasonable.", "Not only are YTA, but she dodged a bullet. I hope her employer is more understanding than you and she moves on and finds someone with common sense and respect.", "YTA. It was less than a week - it's not as if she's left the stuff for months. And it doesn't sound like she \"kept\" making excuses - she gave you reasons why the days you proposed did not work for her and offered an alternative day (TOMORROW... again, not like next week or next month... it was ONE DAY). You're just being petty and I suspect KNEW it would at a minimum interrupt her work day, if not worse.", "YTA", "YTA. I feel bad for your ex. You ask for a favor with your kid, she obliges but you can\u2019t show a little bit of patience? You are gonna be really petty and make coparenting a nightmare aren\u2019t you?", "Jesus what a power trip. Of course YTA. \n\nShe was going to pick them up last weekend but couldn\u2019t because she *had to cover your childcare duties* so you could hang out with a friend! \n\nShe didn\u2019t make \u201cso many excuses\u201d. Her single and perfectly reasonable excuse was that she needed to work\u2026 during her work week. She said she would pickup her boxes up on Friday, which was less than a week after the weekend she was meant to pick them up but *had to cover your childcare duties*!\n\nYou SHIPPED THEM to her work?! Instead of just waiting for her to get them tomorrow?! How much did this cost you?? \n\nBig YTA, and I agree with her mum: she\u2019s very lucky to be you ex wife.", "[deleted]", "Geez dude, you're splitting up, it's over, you can stop with the drama. YTA.", "YTA. What unnecessary drama.", "YTA, and I think it will do your future a lot of good if you start thinking of you ex as your \u201cdaughter\u2019s mother\u201d and treating her the way you would treat the mother of anyone else you might care about.", "YTA and I agree with her mom.", "YTA. She couldn\u2019t get them last weekend because she was doing YOU a favor. She offered to get them Friday, but you decided to be petty and send them to her office to disrupt what you knew was a busy day. The reason for the divorce is crystal clear.

Oh, and BTW - the \"magic was gone\" bit is a cop out.", "Why would she want to have another child when she already has two?", "> (nothing physical ever happened)\n\nSure, Jan", "Sounds like she already had another kid.", "An emotional affair is still an affair. \n\nPerhaps if you didn\u2019t skip the kid you haves events for last minute plans with friends she might have wanted to have another kid with you. Or showed up to PTA meetings. Or didn\u2019t blow up when the plans you\u2019ve changed to better suit yourself give you a minor inconvenience.", "Don\u2019t have more kids until you can understand the concept of always putting them first.\n\n\u201cLuna\u201d taking your daughter to her soccer game shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as her \u201cdoing you a solid\u201d, which some people here have been calling it - She was there for her soccer game and you were absent because some non-emergency thing was more important to you. For that particular instance (I\u2019m trying hard not to judge you as a whole), your daughter\u2019s soccer game was so unimportant to you that you\u2019d rather take the time to coordinate alternative accommodations for her getting to her soccer game so that you could attend a friend\u2019s spontaneous \u201cevent\u201d.\n\nAnyway, if this kind of thing is a pattern, come on, dude. You know you gotta do better than that. Especially if you want more kids.", "Damn, you might be the biggest asshole on this sub today. Congrats!", "But you were having an affair. Emotional affairs count and can be more devastating than physical. YTA", "YTA. YOU changed the plans of her picking it up this weekend. You want more kids when you couldn\u2019t even take care of your daughter on your weekend ? Lmao that\u2019s hilarious", "If you want things to be amicable, then you are definitely starting off on the wrong foot. Sending her stuff because you don't want to look at it FOR ONE MORE DAY, is ANYTHING BUT amicable.", "INFO: Who did the majority of child care? Why did she think she didn't have time for another one?", "OH! Missed that bit - thank you for pointing it out.  OP - YTA.", "It sounds like the ex is being deliberately obstructive about picking up her stuff. It's understandable (not 'correct', just understandable) that he would get annoyed by that.", "No wonder she was hesitant to have more children with him!  She does him a favor by taking their daughter on his weekend to help out, and he decides to repay her by being petty.", "I wasn\u2019t cheating BUT\u2026..", "He offered her two days, and she had work stuff and a PTA meeting on those days. I guess I disagree that this sounds like deliberate obstruction. It's more like the kind of usual stuff a busy working mom would have in her schedule.", "Obstructive? She accommodated him so he could go to a friend's event instead of being with his daughter and gave him a day that she would collect them. All reasonable. He couldn't wait one more day. Now if she didn't come Friday maybe he could have sent them to her mothers. He is being petty.", "Lol the reason she couldn\u2019t get the boxes that weekend was because she was doing him a favor taking the daughter to a soccer game, since he wanted to hang out w his friends instead of spending his custody days w his kid. \n\nShe has a job she can\u2019t just skip work to get the stuff at his convenience, the days he offered didn\u2019t work for her.\n\nHe sent her stuff over Thursday when she wa gonna get it the next day! He should\u2019ve just waited 24 hours!", "I guess my question then is how long would it really take and how far away do they live from each other. \n\nIf going over to pick up some boxes (can't be too much or it wouldn't have been deliverable to her office) is a major event then I can understand not being able to fit it in. I think I was presuming that the distance isn't too great and the actual pickup would be trivial.", "I don't think he was being reasonable, I can just see how he might get frustrated by the situation.", "Can\u2019t imagine why she didn\u2019t want another kid, they\u2019ve been split for 6 minutes and he\u2019s already shirking his custody time.", "I've said this in another comment but I was presuming (probably incorrectly) that the pickup would be quite trivial as it sounds like they don't live to far away from each other and there can't be that much stuff anyway (as he was able to have it delivered).\n\nIf she genuinely didn't have time then it's all on him, yeah.", "She would've moved her stuff but he asked her to do something else instead the very weekend before. It totally make sense to have time at the next weekend. \n\n\nShe said from the first reshedule (he wanted, not her) that she will do it friday. \n\n\n\nWhy do you not believe her?", "He is the cause of his own frustration not her, he chose going to a friend's event over his daughter's game on a day the ex had planned to get her items but because HE changed things she accommodated HIM and HIS request, HE is the only person to blame for this.", "Just going to his house is already time consuming and if he\u2019s that pissed it\u2019s probably more than just 1 little box\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to drive it over to her house either bc he felt it was too far\n\nAnd she\u2019s JUST moved out the week before!\n\nHonestly if he made her change her weekend plans so she couldn\u2019t get her things, the most normal thing would have been to reschedule the pickup to the next WEEKEND, not some random weekday when normal people have to work! She probably agreed to do it Friday before the weekend just to appease him. It sounds like he was purposely trying to mess w her job, and when he couldn\u2019t do it by forcing her to skip work, he sent her stuff there instead.", "It's quite obvious that I read this situation differently from most of the other people here. I'm willing to say I'm probably incorrect."]}
