Just like my husband, he was a safe driver who wore all the top tier safety gear, but he was waiting to turn left onto the street he lived on and a car hit him and he did not survive. When my husband realized how much more he loved our child than he ever loved his bike, he sold it that summer.\n\nNothing my husband's friend could have done would have changed the other driver's actions.

As others have said, yes, there are things we do on a daily basis that pose risk to our lives, such as driving a car or eating poor diets. However, there are risks as a society we don\u2019t seem as acceptable, like stopping on train tracks. This is because the probability of surviving the 1 in 10000 chance that something will happen is lower if we stop on train tracks versus being in a car accident.\n\nWhen you look at buying a family car you will undoubtedly look at buying the safest car you can get. When you purchase car seats and cribs and clothing you will buy the safest things you can manage for your family. You will seek to minimize risk, generally we consider parents who do not take these measures negligent to some degree. Using a car as your means of transportation is minimizing risk.\n\nYou cannot reasonably remove all risk from life - driving on a daily basis is a necessity for most people.

Riding a motorcycle is a lot closer in risk to Russian roulette than eating bacon or driving in a car. I personally don\u2019t find that to be a tolerable level of risk and would not consider someone who rides a motorcycle to be a viable father to my children. Life insurance or not no one wants to be a widow and have to raise kids whose dad died bc he\u2019s thrill seeking and didn\u2019t prioritize his safety to be able to raise his children.\n\nEdited to add: a solid chunk (42%) or motorcycle fatalities are caused by people turning left into a motorcycle they don\u2019t notice. That is absolutely not the fault of the motorcyclist and has nothing at all to do with how safe they are or what gear they are wearing or if they took classes or not. They\u2019re dead now. So the idea that you can control this risk in a meaningful way by \u201cbeing safer\u201d is silly.

Not wanting your children\u2019s parent to ride a motorcycle is reasonable.  It may make you incompatible, though.  That sucks, but better than being a widow with a small child (or small children), suffering the list of your partner/their father.", "NTA\n\nYou're not an asshole for telling him that.   You would become an asshole if you tried to enforce it.\n\nYou do not get to decide whether he rides a motorcycle, whether you have children or not.\n\nYou can, on the other hand, take out a large life insurance policy as well as Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance.\n\nHe's a grown adult, he gets to assess the risk of riding his motorcycle vs the joy he gets from riding it.\n\nIf you are absolutely against his riding if the two of you have children you either need to be careful about your birth control and not have children with him, or divorce him and get married to and have children with someone who shares your view on motorcycles.", "YTA.

I got really tired of people telling me \"At least he died doing something he loved.\"\n\nNTA", "YTA. \n\nImagine him telling you that you cannot eat unhealthy food, and micromanaged your food intake, because heart disease is the number one killer of women. It isn\u2019t appropriate to demand that your significant other give up things they love to save them from themselves. That being said, you DON\u2019T have to be comfortable with a partner who wants to do that, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he has to be comfortable giving it up, or that you have to stay with him if it makes you that uncomfortable. It just means, that if he is your person, you both have to be willing to compromise. \n\nIf he takes the appropriate safety precautions, has the proper riding education, and always wears safety gear, riding isn\u2019t much more dangerous than driving a tin can,  because of the maneuverability. The reason the stats are so high is mostly due to improper safety precautions while riding. It\u2019s never going to be as safe as a truck or something, but unless he\u2019s an untrained clown on it, it can provide stress and health benefits that are likely worth the risk. Maybe suggest that he take safety classes and get better gear, and gear fittings. there are a TON of riding courses available in every state, and a good place to call about the ones available close to you is through the DMV or any nearby military base (which will have it\u2019s own motorcycle safety office). If it is his main mode of transportation, You could also ask that he not use it for as much commuting, and use it for intentional rides only, and get a more family appropriate car so it isn\u2019t only on your to transport the children. \n\nYou cannot keep him from dying. He could die in a car accident, from cancer, from a heart attack, from almost anything. You can\u2019t prevent it. The only thing you will accomplish with this ultimatum is driving a wedge between you, removing a stress reliever for him, and setting him up to resent you,  and possibly your future child, and ultimately, things like this could end up snowballing until your relationship fails\u2026 and then you\u2019re on your own anyway.", "Ohhh...OK. I'm going to give some insight here because I really don't know what judgment to give except NAH. \n\nI grew up in a state that, to this day, does not require motorcycle helmets. \n\nMy dad always wore one anyway. He was an artist and sign maker. I remember riding on the back of his bike when I was in kindergarten. Always with a helmet. He rode his bike a lot because it was cheaper on gas than his big work truck or pickup. (This was in the 80's)\n\nOne day...dad didn't come home. I was about 6. My brother was even younger. We didn't see him for almost 2 weeks. Mom said he was working on a job in another state....when mom was actually home. \n\nHe finally came home...on crutches in an air cast. Whole body covered in road rash. But his head intact. My brother and I were horrified. \n\nTurns out he had spent 2 weeks in the hospital. He was going through the one stoplight in our town and a woman ran a red and broadsided him, carried him through the intersection and hosed him and his bike. \n\nDad was on crutches and a walker for a year...and still managed to run his business. \n\nBut he never got on a motorcycle again and even went as far as to tell me that he never wanted to see me on one. \n\nHis helmet, calved off on the left side, hung in his sign shop until a fire destroyed the shop 10 years later.  To encourage people to wear helmets, he offered free airbrushing and custom painting on anyone who brought in a full face helmet. \n\nI understand the draw of motorcycles. I also know that when ridden correctly, they are safe. But I also know that you can't trust other drivers and someone on a bike is no match for, say, a distracted driver in a half ton pickup truck. \n\nHe has probably never experienced seeing someone seriously injured or killed in a wreck. \n\nMy dad stopped because he realized that almost left my brother and I without a father. \n\nPerhaps you have a compromise. He can keep his bike but increases his life insurance?", "My partner grew up around bikes and extreme sports. I didn't. He didn't get a bike until our kiddo was older. Now I love to ride. I still definitely have my anxiety around bikes, they are dangerous. Flat out. Maybe you can compromise on cooling it with bikes until kids are older? Also get a good life insurance policy. Nta for trying to set some boundaries.", "Slight YTA.  You are concerned for safety and the future, not being malicious.  However good your intentions are though, you do not have the right to order someone to stop their hobby.  If you do not want to have children with someone who rides a motorcycle, the appropriate decision is to end the relationship.  While I agree with you that they are dangerous, it is not your decision to make.

Riding a motorcycle on an empty straight 2 lane highway is much safer than riding a motorcycle on crowded highways in metro areas like southern NY.  Some riders refuse to wear helmets and do other deliberately dangerous maneuvers like weave between cars or pop wheelies, whereas others ride speed limit, minimize lane changes, and wear full body riding gear.  My point is some people really are thrill seeking and make motorcycle riding more dangerous whereas others are quite safe.  Which category sounds more like your husband?", "YTA. riding a motorcycle with the proper gear isn't much less safer than driving a car somewhere. and if it makes him happy, the emotional benefits can outweigh the negative as far as his overall health is concerned. \n\nif you were just insisting he rides safely/legally and with the proper gear, i'd be on your side. if he wants to ride fast he can do it on track days. but telling him he can't ride at all is an AH move. y'all might as well work from home, never leave, and have all your food delivered from now on if you're gonna go that route.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

I am a motorcyclist on indefinite hiatus, myself. I rode as my only source of transportation for nearly a decade. I loved it and miss it dearly. I do intend to throw my leg over the saddle again in the future but, not on-road. Riding safe, sober, and ATGATT is lower risk than popular belief would have one believe.\n\nMy perspective was very much like your husband's until I got sideswiped on the highway, when heading home from work 3.5 years ago. It was about a 40MPH (64K/H) get-off and a high-side at that (I was thrown forward, over the handlebars rather than laying it down, aka \"low-side\"). During the few seconds that I was sliding, I had to steer myself away from traffic, with the steel sliders on my gloves, and got hit by my bike as it took longer to slow down than I did.\n\nWhen I stopped, concerned motorists were there almost immediately and one of them handed me my phone which had been mounted to the handlebars prior to the wreck. I unlocked it and called my wife, telling her \"I might be a bit late tonight\" and let one of the responders fill her in. (Supcase Unicorn Beetle Pro, in case you want to know how the phone survived).\n\nOver the next half hour or so, I was taken to the hospital by ambulance, triaged, then rolled out into the trauma ward hall for a few hours to make room for those with life-threatening injuries.

As much as I wanted to just hop back in the saddle, I concluded that it would be incredibly selfish of me to do so. I was the primary income, with a wife who has crippling anxiety. All of the gear in the world won't make a bike as safe as being wrapped in a steel cage. I'm not willing to put her through worrying if I'm going to come home every day.\n\nThat said, it is not a small thing to give up, even if not permanently.

I have some trepidation around motorcycles too, but realistically, people drive them safely every day.\n\nHere's what you *can* do, though - if this bothers you that much, stop trying for kids. Go on birth control. He doesn't have to stop riding a motorcycle, but you don't have to give birth to a child if you have a deep fear of being widowed with a small child to take care of for whatever reason. Put the brakes on the starting a family idea; revisit it later. Don't just close the door on the subject, talk about it. Maybe he'll be able to convince you that he's careful and drives safely and you'll feel better about it. Maybe he'll get bored with it. Maybe y:all can come up with some kind of compromise that works for you - I don't know, a better helmet? Other protective gear? More life insurance? \n\nListen, I know what kind of reaction this is going to get, but I'm not suggesting \"manipulate him into giving up his hobby by refusing to have children.\" I'm saying that if this is that big a problem for you, you probably shouldn't add kids until some kind of resolution is reached, and you don't have to. Do *not* say something like \"we're not having kids until you give up the motorcycle and promise never to ride one again.'\" But you're allowed to not have children if you feel there's a high chance you'll be left alone with them for this reason. You can't make him give up the bike. But you don't have to have any children. You tell him something to the effect of \"I can't get past this fear that I'm going to end up a widow raising children alone because of a motorcycle accident, and I can't have a baby with that fear hanging over me. We need to think about some solutions before we have a baby.\" And you figure out a way to work through it that's reasonable to both of you and gets you where you want to be.\n\nI can't know from my side of the screen if you're being totally irrational or if he's giving you more reason to worry than the average motorcyclist or a little from column A and a little from Column B. I don't know what exactly gets you from here to a place where you feel more comfortable having kids. Do you guys talk about what safety precautions he takes? Would you feel better if he took a motorcycle safety course or something? I don't know, I'm just throwing ideas out here.  I mean, you could look up statistics, people can tell you that he'll probably be fine, he could tell you that, but if that's not enough for you, the two of you will need to come up with something that does work for you, and I don't know if that means you need to do something (like some kind of therapy to get past the fear) or if he needs to do something (like take more precautions) or something else. But I am sure that you can figure it out first, then have kids.\n\nYTA for how you approached it - outside of some extreme behavior, you really don't want to be giving ultimatums about your adult partner's hobbies. Just riding a motorcycle doesn't qualify as extreme. I don't think you're an AH for having this fear, though. I don't even think it's a totally unreasonable fear - but I do think you've probably overblown a legitimate risk while downplaying any number of other possible legitimate risks. Accidents and unexpected illnesses happen all the time; anything could happen, being left alone with kids is kind of a risk you take when you have them, and if you're *only* worried about it happening due to motorcycle accidents, you probably are overly fixating on it or he's doing something to make it especially worrisome. So resolve whatever that is first.", "NAH\n\nI get both sides of the argument.  He has something he loves, it's part of who he is.  And you want him to give it up.

Beyond typically having advanced licences why would a commuter pay much cheaper insurance costs than a hobbyist who does a lot less mileage, they even pay less than car drivers which is odd especially when they are 50 times more likely to die than a car driver?\n\nThe answer is actually simple and horrifying at the same time. The amount of commuter motorcyclists in the UK are tiny , barely into the double digits percentage of all motorcyclists however statistically they have the least amount of accidents, crashes, fatalities etc both in amount and proportionally than ANY OTHER METHOD OF TRANSPORT so where does that 50 times more likely come from? \n\nHobbyists, and considering that 50 times is an average between the two groups,one of which is statistically apparently the safest method of transport and one that's the most deadliest according to the average what does that actually make the real figure for hobbyists? \n\nAs the statistic is based on miles traveled per transport method and insurance groups estimate about 35% of miles driven are by commuters that leaves 65% of the travel attributed to hobbyists that makes that 50 times figure jump almost to 100 TIMES MORE LIKELY.\n\nSo my response to anyone looking to \"get into motorcycling\" is:\n\n1: All of the gear ALL of the time \n2: Never stop learning , get your advanced qualifications and training and follow it ALWAYS\n3: Ride all weathers \n4: learn the limits of you and the bike on a track not a road\n5: Ride to the conditions and atmosphere (traffic , drivers observations, time of day IE school pickups etc) not the road\n\n\nIf you cannot follow these rules don't bother riding on the road , your dangerous/not caring of the danger and will be a statistic.

I almost lost my brother due to his poor decision making and peer pressures. I look back to when I first got my motorcycle license (at 15 yrs of age), and recall how utterly pissed my mom was when I came home on my first sportbike. I look back at how I honestly put myself in danger and shake my head, shaming myself for even speeding like I've done in the past. \n\nNow here's the thing. In spite of my personal experience, I've learned that motorcycle riding isn't dangerous just because the motorcyclist decides to throw caution to the wind. There are sooooo many external factors that come into play, sometimes just nature being the culprit to an accident. My brother is in a motorcycle crew and on one of their group rides, one guy on a sportbike, who was just cruising, slipped on a turn due to some gravel, and had to get sent to the ER because his shin snapped in half and the bone was sticking out of his body. \n\nYour NTA here because it's not like your just thinking about \"what am I going to do if you leave me alone\", but rather you are more concerned about your future with him and overall his own safety. I can tell that you are also a very kind hearted person, as you also consider the fact that this is his hobby and hate to have to put him in this situation. \n\nIt's hard to give any advice that will give you any peace of mind tbh. I hope that you don't give him an ultimatum, as that could exasperate the situation, but I do hope that he maybe talks to some third party person, someone who is unbiased, to help him understand where you're coming from. Who knows ,maybe there could be a compromise? Especially with a newborn possibly coming into the picture, it's not like he can be riding all day and not help at home. \n\nI'm not sure if this might help at all, but I know my mom HATED the idea of me riding a motorcycle. She's a hypochondriac and lives with perpetual anxiety. She was always concerned that I'd end up in an accident while riding.  I assured her that I would do my absolute best to remain as vigilant as possible.  As I gained riding experience, I eventually told my mom to follow me as we drove to a family get together, her in her car while I was in front on my motorcycle. After she saw my riding habits and how I handled everyday riding, she felt at ease. These days, I don't go fast on the streets and reserve that for track riding only. My mom knows this, and despite it still being dangerous, at least she has admitted to me that she has some peace of mind knowing that I'm enjoying myself while being as responsible as I can be. In fact, just last year was my moms first time, in 68 years, to ride on a motorcycle. No not my sportbike, but my brothers cruiser. We only went around the block in a quiet neighboord about 3 times, but once she got off, she just said \"I now understand why you love riding.\" \n\nTL;DR: NTA, you are concerned for your husband's safety above all else and the prospect of a newborn is putting you in a tough situation. You're not giving him an ultimatum, but as a fellow motorcyclist, I believe he should seriously consider your concerns and at the very least come to some sort of compromise. The truth is, riding motorcycles is dangerous no matter how you look at it, but there are options that should be considered to minimize the risk of injury or death while still possibly allowing for an occasional ride here and there.

Ironically, he had survived a previous motorcycle accident with a plate in his head. He\u2019d recovered, got married, and had 2 little kids. He had also decided to continue riding. Without a helmet. The second accident hadn\u2019t turned out so well. I was \u2014 and still am \u2014 angry at him for his selfishness.

I know that they\u2019re economical. I also get that there\u2019s a sense of freedom that some have when riding a motorcycle. For heaven\u2019s sake, wear your gear! At the very least, wear a helmet!\n\nBut once you have children, especially minor children, your personal safety has to be your priority. Children need their parents not just for physical support, but also for emotional and developmental support. Yes, parenting requires sacrifice. A lot of it. Nothing truly worthwhile comes without some kind of sacrifice. You become a parent, sacrifice the motorcycle. You can go back to it when the kids are grown.

One more half drunk cup of coffee left on the table rather than in the sink. If only they could piss you off again, just one more time, ha. Eventually, you notice the shadows playing on the ground and look up and see the sun peeking through. And you're mad at it, and stare down again. As time passes, you see the sun in a reflection in a puddle on the ground, and the trees in that reflection, and you briefly think \"oh, that's pretty.\" As more time passes, you actually hear the birds again, and look up to the sky, and notice the beauty. And it doesn't make you cry quite as long. And later still, you can remember the good times, and it doesn't drop you for the day, they actually make you smile. \n\nTook 4 years to decide it was better to have loved and lost.

I see I may be the odd woman out here, but I feel like your and your husband both have valid feelings on this.\n\nTo your point - Motorcycles are dangerous because other drivers on the roads often don't look out for them.

And as far as this one is concerned, it's a pretty innocent one, even if it does come with added risk.\n\nConsider: You're stressing yourself out over this due to your past experiences. Get some counseling to try to work through your fear. Ask him to take you on rides once you've had some so that you can try to put yourself in his place and witness his riding skills to ease your mind. Talk to him more about your fears that remain.

It's not your choice. \n\nMy husband became interested in motorcycles after we got together, too. When we had babies, he was too busy to ride. We still have the bike. I ask him to sell it, and he says no every time. He agrees that he probably won't ride it again, but it doesn't take up much space, and it's paid off and uninsured. It costs us nothing. He just feels a need to hold onto it. \n\nIt's a piece of his past and individuality. He doesn't have to share it. \n\nIf your husband doesn't have the same reaction, make him get a huge life insurance policy AND disability insurance.

A new G1 driver coming the other way drifted over into their lane and hit him head on. His body landed on the golf course the road ran by. Literally a doctor ran over and  tried to help but he was gone.  And i'm sure that 16yr old girl still talks to a psychiatrist on a couch about it once a week to this day. It was all so fucking sad.
