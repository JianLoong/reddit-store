Just like my husband, he was a safe driver who wore all the top tier safety gear, but he was waiting to turn left onto the street he lived on and a car hit him and he did not survive. When my husband realized how much more he loved our child than he ever loved his bike, he sold it that summer.\n\nNothing my husband's friend could have done would have changed the other driver's actions.

As others have said, yes, there are things we do on a daily basis that pose risk to our lives, such as driving a car or eating poor diets. However, there are risks as a society we don\u2019t seem as acceptable, like stopping on train tracks. This is because the probability of surviving the 1 in 10000 chance that something will happen is lower if we stop on train tracks versus being in a car accident.\n\nWhen you look at buying a family car you will undoubtedly look at buying the safest car you can get.

You will seek to minimize risk, generally we consider parents who do not take these measures negligent to some degree. Using a car as your means of transportation is minimizing risk.\n\nYou cannot reasonably remove all risk from life - driving on a daily basis is a necessity for most people.

Riding a motorcycle is a lot closer in risk to Russian roulette than eating bacon or driving in a car. I personally don\u2019t find that to be a tolerable level of risk and would not consider someone who rides a motorcycle to be a viable father to my children.

You would become an asshole if you tried to enforce it.\n\nYou do not get to decide whether he rides a motorcycle, whether you have children or not.\n\nYou can, on the other hand, take out a large life insurance policy as well as Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance.\n\nHe's a grown adult, he gets to assess the risk of riding his motorcycle vs the joy he gets from riding it.\n\nIf you are absolutely against his riding if the two of you have children you either need to be careful about your birth control and not have children with him, or divorce him and get married to and have children with someone who shares your view on motorcycles.", "YTA.

It isn\u2019t appropriate to demand that your significant other give up things they love to save them from themselves. That being said, you DON\u2019T have to be comfortable with a partner who wants to do that, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he has to be comfortable giving it up, or that you have to stay with him if it makes you that uncomfortable. It just means, that if he is your person, you both have to be willing to compromise. \n\nIf he takes the appropriate safety precautions, has the proper riding education, and always wears safety gear, riding isn\u2019t much more dangerous than driving a tin can,  because of the maneuverability. The reason the stats are so high is mostly due to improper safety precautions while riding. It\u2019s never going to be as safe as a truck or something, but unless he\u2019s an untrained clown on it, it can provide stress and health benefits that are likely worth the risk. Maybe suggest that he take safety classes and get better gear, and gear fittings. there are a TON of riding courses available in every state, and a good place to call about the ones available close to you is through the DMV or any nearby military base (which will have it\u2019s own motorcycle safety office). If it is his main mode of transportation, You could also ask that he not use it for as much commuting, and use it for intentional rides only, and get a more family appropriate car so it isn\u2019t only on your to transport the children. \n\nYou cannot keep him from dying. He could die in a car accident, from cancer, from a heart attack, from almost anything. You can\u2019t prevent it. The only thing you will accomplish with this ultimatum is driving a wedge between you, removing a stress reliever for him, and setting him up to resent you,  and possibly your future child, and ultimately, things like this could end up snowballing until your relationship fails\u2026 and then you\u2019re on your own anyway.", "Ohhh...OK. I'm going to give some insight here because I really don't know what judgment to give except NAH. \n\nI grew up in a state that, to this day, does not require motorcycle helmets. \n\nMy dad always wore one anyway. He was an artist and sign maker. I remember riding on the back of his bike when I was in kindergarten. Always with a helmet. He rode his bike a lot because it was cheaper on gas than his big work truck or pickup. (This was in the 80's)\n\nOne day...dad didn't come home. I was about 6. My brother was even younger. We didn't see him for almost 2 weeks. Mom said he was working on a job in another state....when mom was actually home. \n\nHe finally came home...on crutches in an air cast. Whole body covered in road rash. But his head intact. My brother and I were horrified. \n\nTurns out he had spent 2 weeks in the hospital. He was going through the one stoplight in our town and a woman ran a red and broadsided him, carried him through the intersection and hosed him and his bike. \n\nDad was on crutches and a walker for a year...and still managed to run his business. \n\nBut he never got on a motorcycle again and even went as far as to tell me that he never wanted to see me on one. \n\nHis helmet, calved off on the left side, hung in his sign shop until a fire destroyed the shop 10 years later.  To encourage people to wear helmets, he offered free airbrushing and custom painting on anyone who brought in a full face helmet. \n\nI understand the draw of motorcycles. I also know that when ridden correctly, they are safe. But I also know that you can't trust other drivers and someone on a bike is no match for, say, a distracted driver in a half ton pickup truck. \n\nHe has probably never experienced seeing someone seriously injured or killed in a wreck. \n\nMy dad stopped because he realized that almost left my brother and I without a father. \n\nPerhaps you have a compromise. He can keep his bike but increases his life insurance?", "My partner grew up around bikes and extreme sports. I didn't. He didn't get a bike until our kiddo was older. Now I love to ride. I still definitely have my anxiety around bikes, they are dangerous. Flat out. Maybe you can compromise on cooling it with bikes until kids are older? Also get a good life insurance policy. Nta for trying to set some boundaries.", "Slight YTA.  You are concerned for safety and the future, not being malicious.  However good your intentions are though, you do not have the right to order someone to stop their hobby.  If you do not want to have children with someone who rides a motorcycle, the appropriate decision is to end the relationship.  While I agree with you that they are dangerous, it is not your decision to make.

Riding a motorcycle on an empty straight 2 lane highway is much safer than riding a motorcycle on crowded highways in metro areas like southern NY.  Some riders refuse to wear helmets and do other deliberately dangerous maneuvers like weave between cars or pop wheelies, whereas others ride speed limit, minimize lane changes, and wear full body riding gear.  My point is some people really are thrill seeking and make motorcycle riding more dangerous whereas others are quite safe.  Which category sounds more like your husband?", "YTA. riding a motorcycle with the proper gear isn't much less safer than driving a car somewhere. and if it makes him happy, the emotional benefits can outweigh the negative as far as his overall health is concerned. \n\nif you were just insisting he rides safely/legally and with the proper gear, i'd be on your side. if he wants to ride fast he can do it on track days. but telling him he can't ride at all is an AH move. y'all might as well work from home, never leave, and have all your food delivered from now on if you're gonna go that route.", "> I feel motorcycles are very dangerous\n\nEh, life's dangerous.
