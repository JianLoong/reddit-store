Just like my husband, he was a safe driver who wore all the top tier safety gear, but he was waiting to turn left onto the street he lived on and a car hit him and he did not survive. When my husband realized how much more he loved our child than he ever loved his bike, he sold it that summer.\n\nNothing my husband's friend could have done would have changed the other driver's actions.

As others have said, yes, there are things we do on a daily basis that pose risk to our lives, such as driving a car or eating poor diets. However, there are risks as a society we don\u2019t seem as acceptable, like stopping on train tracks. This is because the probability of surviving the 1 in 10000 chance that something will happen is lower if we stop on train tracks versus being in a car accident.\n\nWhen you look at buying a family car you will undoubtedly look at buying the safest car you can get. When you purchase car seats and cribs and clothing you will buy the safest things you can manage for your family. You will seek to minimize risk, generally we consider parents who do not take these measures negligent to some degree. Using a car as your means of transportation is minimizing risk.\n\nYou cannot reasonably remove all risk from life - driving on a daily basis is a necessity for most people.

If you're unwilling to risk raising kids as a widow, don't have kids.", "Tell him to get a pretty hefty life insurance policy.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s interesting that a lot of people on here are like \u201canything can be risky what are you gonna do?\u201d But I\u2019m guessing they wouldn\u2019t run across a freeway or play Russian roulette or go BASE jumping because it\u2019s extremely risky. Riding a motorcycle is a lot closer in risk to Russian roulette than eating bacon or driving in a car. I personally don\u2019t find that to be a tolerable level of risk and would not consider someone who rides a motorcycle to be a viable father to my children. Life insurance or not no one wants to be a widow and have to raise kids whose dad died bc he\u2019s thrill seeking and didn\u2019t prioritize his safety to be able to raise his children.\n\nEdited to add: a solid chunk (42%) or motorcycle fatalities are caused by people turning left into a motorcycle they don\u2019t notice. That is absolutely not the fault of the motorcyclist and has nothing at all to do with how safe they are or what gear they are wearing or if they took classes or not. They\u2019re dead now. So the idea that you can control this risk in a meaningful way by \u201cbeing safer\u201d is silly.

Not wanting your children\u2019s parent to ride a motorcycle is reasonable.  It may make you incompatible, though.

Someone I went to school with and graduated with in 2016 died in a motorcycle accident on 9/11 in 2021.

I got really tired of people telling me \"At least he died doing something he loved.\"\n\nNTA", "YTA. \n\nImagine him telling you that you cannot eat unhealthy food, and micromanaged your food intake, because heart disease is the number one killer of women. It isn\u2019t appropriate to demand that your significant other give up things they love to save them from themselves. That being said, you DON\u2019T have to be comfortable with a partner who wants to do that, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he has to be comfortable giving it up, or that you have to stay with him if it makes you that uncomfortable. It just means, that if he is your person, you both have to be willing to compromise. \n\nIf he takes the appropriate safety precautions, has the proper riding education, and always wears safety gear, riding isn\u2019t much more dangerous than driving a tin can,  because of the maneuverability. The reason the stats are so high is mostly due to improper safety precautions while riding. It\u2019s never going to be as safe as a truck or something, but unless he\u2019s an untrained clown on it, it can provide stress and health benefits that are likely worth the risk. Maybe suggest that he take safety classes and get better gear, and gear fittings. there are a TON of riding courses available in every state, and a good place to call about the ones available close to you is through the DMV or any nearby military base (which will have it\u2019s own motorcycle safety office). If it is his main mode of transportation, You could also ask that he not use it for as much commuting, and use it for intentional rides only, and get a more family appropriate car so it isn\u2019t only on your to transport the children. \n\nYou cannot keep him from dying. He could die in a car accident, from cancer, from a heart attack, from almost anything. You can\u2019t prevent it. The only thing you will accomplish with this ultimatum is driving a wedge between you, removing a stress reliever for him, and setting him up to resent you,  and possibly your future child, and ultimately, things like this could end up snowballing until your relationship fails\u2026 and then you\u2019re on your own anyway.", "Ohhh...OK. I'm going to give some insight here because I really don't know what judgment to give except NAH. \n\nI grew up in a state that, to this day, does not require motorcycle helmets. \n\nMy dad always wore one anyway. He was an artist and sign maker. I remember riding on the back of his bike when I was in kindergarten. Always with a helmet. He rode his bike a lot because it was cheaper on gas than his big work truck or pickup. (This was in the 80's)\n\nOne day...dad didn't come home. I was about 6. My brother was even younger. We didn't see him for almost 2 weeks. Mom said he was working on a job in another state....when mom was actually home. \n\nHe finally came home...on crutches in an air cast. Whole body covered in road rash. But his head intact. My brother and I were horrified. \n\nTurns out he had spent 2 weeks in the hospital. He was going through the one stoplight in our town and a woman ran a red and broadsided him, carried him through the intersection and hosed him and his bike. \n\nDad was on crutches and a walker for a year...and still managed to run his business. \n\nBut he never got on a motorcycle again and even went as far as to tell me that he never wanted to see me on one. \n\nHis helmet, calved off on the left side, hung in his sign shop until a fire destroyed the shop 10 years later.  To encourage people to wear helmets, he offered free airbrushing and custom painting on anyone who brought in a full face helmet. \n\nI understand the draw of motorcycles. I also know that when ridden correctly, they are safe. But I also know that you can't trust other drivers and someone on a bike is no match for, say, a distracted driver in a half ton pickup truck. \n\nHe has probably never experienced seeing someone seriously injured or killed in a wreck. \n\nMy dad stopped because he realized that almost left my brother and I without a father. \n\nPerhaps you have a compromise. He can keep his bike but increases his life insurance?", "My partner grew up around bikes and extreme sports. I didn't. He didn't get a bike until our kiddo was older. Now I love to ride. I still definitely have my anxiety around bikes, they are dangerous. Flat out. Maybe you can compromise on cooling it with bikes until kids are older? Also get a good life insurance policy. Nta for trying to set some boundaries.", "Slight YTA.  You are concerned for safety and the future, not being malicious.  However good your intentions are though, you do not have the right to order someone to stop their hobby.  If you do not want to have children with someone who rides a motorcycle, the appropriate decision is to end the relationship.  While I agree with you that they are dangerous, it is not your decision to make.

Riding a motorcycle on an empty straight 2 lane highway is much safer than riding a motorcycle on crowded highways in metro areas like southern NY.  Some riders refuse to wear helmets and do other deliberately dangerous maneuvers like weave between cars or pop wheelies, whereas others ride speed limit, minimize lane changes, and wear full body riding gear.  My point is some people really are thrill seeking and make motorcycle riding more dangerous whereas others are quite safe.  Which category sounds more like your husband?", "YTA. riding a motorcycle with the proper gear isn't much less safer than driving a car somewhere. and if it makes him happy, the emotional benefits can outweigh the negative as far as his overall health is concerned. \n\nif you were just insisting he rides safely/legally and with the proper gear, i'd be on your side. if he wants to ride fast he can do it on track days. but telling him he can't ride at all is an AH move. y'all might as well work from home, never leave, and have all your food delivered from now on if you're gonna go that route.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

I do intend to throw my leg over the saddle again in the future but, not on-road. Riding safe, sober, and ATGATT is lower risk than popular belief would have one believe.\n\nMy perspective was very much like your husband's until I got sideswiped on the highway, when heading home from work 3.5 years ago. It was about a 40MPH (64K/H) get-off and a high-side at that (I was thrown forward, over the handlebars rather than laying it down, aka \"low-side\"). During the few seconds that I was sliding, I had to steer myself away from traffic, with the steel sliders on my gloves, and got hit by my bike as it took longer to slow down than I did.\n\nWhen I stopped, concerned motorists were there almost immediately and one of them handed me my phone which had been mounted to the handlebars prior to the wreck. I unlocked it and called my wife, telling her \"I might be a bit late tonight\" and let one of the responders fill her in. (Supcase Unicorn Beetle Pro, in case you want to know how the phone survived).\n\nOver the next half hour or so, I was taken to the hospital by ambulance, triaged, then rolled out into the trauma ward hall for a few hours to make room for those with life-threatening injuries.

As much as I wanted to just hop back in the saddle, I concluded that it would be incredibly selfish of me to do so. I was the primary income, with a wife who has crippling anxiety. All of the gear in the world won't make a bike as safe as being wrapped in a steel cage.

Go on birth control. He doesn't have to stop riding a motorcycle, but you don't have to give birth to a child if you have a deep fear of being widowed with a small child to take care of for whatever reason. Put the brakes on the starting a family idea; revisit it later. Don't just close the door on the subject, talk about it. Maybe he'll be able to convince you that he's careful and drives safely and you'll feel better about it. Maybe he'll get bored with it. Maybe y:all can come up with some kind of compromise that works for you - I don't know, a better helmet? Other protective gear? More life insurance? \n\nListen, I know what kind of reaction this is going to get, but I'm not suggesting \"manipulate him into giving up his hobby by refusing to have children.\" I'm saying that if this is that big a problem for you, you probably shouldn't add kids until some kind of resolution is reached, and you don't have to. Do *not* say something like \"we're not having kids until you give up the motorcycle and promise never to ride one again.'\" But you're allowed to not have children if you feel there's a high chance you'll be left alone with them for this reason. You can't make him give up the bike. But you don't have to have any children. You tell him something to the effect of \"I can't get past this fear that I'm going to end up a widow raising children alone because of a motorcycle accident, and I can't have a baby with that fear hanging over me. We need to think about some solutions before we have a baby.\" And you figure out a way to work through it that's reasonable to both of you and gets you where you want to be.\n\nI can't know from my side of the screen if you're being totally irrational or if he's giving you more reason to worry than the average motorcyclist or a little from column A and a little from Column B. I don't know what exactly gets you from here to a place where you feel more comfortable having kids. Do you guys talk about what safety precautions he takes? Would you feel better if he took a motorcycle safety course or something? I don't know, I'm just throwing ideas out here.  I mean, you could look up statistics, people can tell you that he'll probably be fine, he could tell you that, but if that's not enough for you, the two of you will need to come up with something that does work for you, and I don't know if that means you need to do something (like some kind of therapy to get past the fear) or if he needs to do something (like take more precautions) or something else. But I am sure that you can figure it out first, then have kids.\n\nYTA for how you approached it - outside of some extreme behavior, you really don't want to be giving ultimatums about your adult partner's hobbies. Just riding a motorcycle doesn't qualify as extreme. I don't think you're an AH for having this fear, though. I don't even think it's a totally unreasonable fear - but I do think you've probably overblown a legitimate risk while downplaying any number of other possible legitimate risks. Accidents and unexpected illnesses happen all the time; anything could happen, being left alone with kids is kind of a risk you take when you have them, and if you're *only* worried about it happening due to motorcycle accidents, you probably are overly fixating on it or he's doing something to make it especially worrisome. So resolve whatever that is first.", "NAH\n\nI get both sides of the argument.  He has something he loves, it's part of who he is.  And you want him to give it up.

Thank fuck for that, I'll just get on with my day like nothing happened!\n\nNope sorry, he's a father now, he needs to prioritise staying alive more now, tough shit, sell the bike.", "NTA", "NTA because it\u2019s a legitimate concern - as others have said medical staff call them donor cycles for a reason. \n\nHis response makes me wonder if he\u2019s really thought through what being a parent will mean and whether the two of you have the same expectations about what parenthood is. You\u2019re talking to him about what it would do to you to be left to parent a child alone, what it would do to the child to lose their father and why when people become parents they should become more safety conscious so as to minimise the risk of that situation happening (all of which seems very reasonable to me). His response of \u201cat least I\u2019d have died doing what I loved\u201d makes it sound like he hasn\u2019t thought about parenthood in those terms - about the change in priorities and being responsible for/to someone else.\n\nSounds to me like the two of you  might need to have some serious conversations about priorities and what you think life as parents looks like before you get pregnant.", "YTA. Its his body, his choice and you are also very controling", "NTA my uncle died in a motorcycle accident. He had five kids under 10.", "I know exactly what you're saying and I agree with you. But loads of people have motorcycles and families, it's not exactly niche, so I'm not sure telling him what to do here is appropriate. But you definitely need to make sure he knows exactly how you feel, and why, you're absolutely NTA for that.", "I\u2019ve known multiple people who died in multiple motorcycle accidents, and two that are in wheelchairs for life, and I don\u2019t even know that many people. \n\nAs much fun as motorcycles are, it\u2019s not a safe activity. I wouldn\u2019t judge someone for wanting to ride one, just like I wouldn\u2019t judge someone who is into base-jumping, but OP needs to ask herself if she wants to have a child that she might have to raise her self, or while she\u2019s taking care of a disabled husband. Of course that could happen anyway, but he is actively courting it. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nNTA.", "So sorry for your loss. Biased as well. Never met a person who owned a motorcycle who hasn't gotten hurt on it. It's because you're going nearly as fast as a car without the big metal frame to protect the soft bag of bones that is you. And they have to go fast, or what's the point?\n\nETA: NTA", "Hah.  I once said that to someone whose partner died of smoking-related cancers.  Sometimes it's the only thing you can say in the moment and if it isn't appropriate, it isn't appropriate because there's absolutely *nothing* appropriate to say.\n\nI'm really sorry,", "Yeah NTA. \n\nI remember going through drivers Ed 20 years ago and our instructor had a motorcycle. \n\nWhen we covered motorcycles in class he specifically said that there was a reason people called them \u201cdonorcycles\u201d. He also said that should we, at any point, ever get one that you needed to have a life insurance policy. He said that when he bought his bike, his insurance agent suggested adding a life insurance policy of at least half a million dollars that would pay out because when you ride, it\u2019s not \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019. Especially as he had small children at the time.", "This is really it for me. I'm a good driver, and I like to think I would be a good motorcyclist - but looking at the average driver on the road, I just can't do it. So many idiots, inattentive drivers, just bad drivers, or even just good drivers who have a momentary lapse. It's just too dangerous out there.", "As a widow with 2 kids\u2026 I would much rather have my husband than the life insurance. In fact, after he died, I had so many dreams about trying to give the life insurance money back if he was allowed to come back to life.", "& don't lie to insurance about the motorcycle, can you imagine if he lied & then the insurance refused to cover because of that", "Bless you, and I am so sorry for the suffering you have endured. Thank you for offering sound advice. Very sad about your friend, too.", "My husband's coworker stopped cave diving after he had kids. Admire your responsibility.", "Seriously. What a selfish prick. It's not only him anymore, there's a kid to think about now.", "This.  The last guy I knew whose wife did this was divorced a few years later. - this wasn\u2019t the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, but she made the same arguments and it was just another reflection of her not seeing him as a person with autonomy that she valued - she thought she was the boss of him.  This was not the case, as she later found out.  They had a child together and it didn\u2019t keep them together.  Others will simply refuse - he\u2019s an adult and you have no legal, moral or other right to tell him what to do, so perhaps you should reconsider having a child with him, and if he has enough self respect to not accept subservience and giving up his autonomy, he may be reconsidering having one with you already, or may just intend not to comply.  Thinking you can give him orders like this is incorrect, makes YTA, and whether he cedes or not it generates resentment, distance and distrust in the relationship, and you should consider carefully the consequences of treating him as subject to demands.", "You're right, but she does have the right to not procreate with someone who <insert any not bigoted reason>.\n\nAnd as reasons go,  I personally agree with her. I was hit 3 times while driving a car,  not my fault all cases.", "Almost half of motorcycle accidents involve the cyclist having alcohol in their system. That's not safe. Cars are dangerous, but people absolutely shouldn't drink and hop on the bike.", "Why do you. Type like that.", "Oh my god. Me, too. I\u2019m so sorry.", "My FIL died on his about a month after my husband and I had our first child. So biased too, but NTA.", "Dress for the slide, not for the ride!", "I was always told, dress for the slide, not for the ride. \n\nOp, NTA but maybe there's some kind of compromise you two could work out?", "I am so sorry for your loss.", "A colleague of my husband gave up cave diving (scuba), when he had kids.", "My cousin had written his will really young due to a heart issue but he died because he came off of his motorbike. His will stipulated a motorbike hearse with coffin sidecar and his wife stuck with that even though it was what killed him", "Absolutely. And Happy Cake Day.", "I don't understand what OPs dude expected her to get out of, \"Just know I died doing something I loved.\" \n\nOther than, \"Yes, I'm willing to put my temporary enjoyment above your and our potential children's long-term security and welfare.\"\n\nI mean, seriously...\n\nI guess at least he's revealed his true nature and priorities. \ud83e\udd37\n\nNTA OP", "My late friend's sister, told me she hated when people wished her strength/courage, (I am not translating the expression well, but it is something we use frequently), while she was taking care of her gravely ill sis, because to her was a reminder that harder staff was ahead. Most times, there are no right words, just a clumsy effort, to comfort the person, by showing that we acknowledge their pain, their loss is seen, and we care for it.", "A terrible one said to my friend in her 30s was \"at least you're still young.\"", "I don\u2019t think the last one is so bad, neither is the first one really imo, sometimes people need to just say I am sorry for your loss and move on. I once said something really dumb to someone bcuz sometimes you feel so bad for the other person and their suffering but sometimes you need to be quiet and just say I am so sorry for your loss and then period, end of sentence. And again quiet and then let them talk.", "Good to know.", "I got one of those reddit cares emails the other day\u2026 lol. Is it because I was downvoted for something?  Like, reddit doesn\u2019t think I can handle some idiots on Reddit down voting my comment?", "I firmly believe part of deciding to become a parent means making sacrifices. Hubby has said he isn't willing to do that and has a \"My way or the highway\" attitude when discussing end of life possibilities that impacts them as a family. It would be smart to hold off on kids and get marriage counseling before continuing to try.  It also might be worth showing OP this thread where a lot of motorcycle people are saying \"no he's an AH and he needs to think of his kids. I did that and my parent/other family member did that when they had children.\" It might knock some sense into him, but again, there's an underlying issue where his partner voices a concern, he dismisses it. There's deeper issues in a relationship when you need someone outside of the relationship to give your partner a reality check, but that can be worked on if the person wants to. But they have to be on the same page before they have a kid, or the kid is going to be the one that suffers for it", "I always think of Christopher Reeve and his terrible fall at 43. Died of complications at 52."]}
