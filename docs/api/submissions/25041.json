He didn\u2019t want to say sorry because he didn\u2019t feel sorry for her so why would he even give her that sliver of emotional support? He didn\u2019t want to keep talking to her so why would he stay on the phone for an excuse? Like I said he doesn\u2019t need to emotionally support her or emotionally cater to her after what she said and you agreed, that\u2019s what he would be doing by following your suggestions. He would be catering to her emotions and giving her emotional support even for one conversation by saying he felt bad and oh that sucks so much an oh I\u2019m so heart broken for you I\u2019m so sorry. Why would he do that for her when you acknowledged he shouldn\u2019t have to after what she said?", "Also I would say two weeks after is a fair amount of time to be rude in this situation, after all his sister only waited one or two more weeks than that to say what she said and do what she did. So I would argue it\u2019s an appropriate time to respond with that seeing as it lines up almost the same with how long his sister waited and said the exact same thing to them.", "Well, now you can stop doing it.  And maybe stop being so soft that you downvote all my stuff just because I noticed you're spamming.", "If you check the timestamps of all my comments, you'll see I posted those AND stopped a while ago.\nAlso get over yourself. Reddit literally tells you how many people are on a topic AND how many are typing.", "ESH except the wife who seems like she\u2019s just trying to form connections the best way she knows how. But you pulled an attitude like that on your grieving sister and call her the petty one? You all need to grow up and learn some emotional regulation.", "You and your sister are both the AH. Miscarriages are devastating. It is not time for tit for tat.", "ESH. Your sister sounds toxic. But you shouldn't have been so rough on her when you saw how much pain it caused Your wife. \n\nBut also, please tell your wife to seek therapy. I've had two miscarriages and I don't think its right to force everyone else to walk on eggshells around me because of it.", "YTA. You are the AH here.", "Yes. So is she. You all need family counselling.", "You are all horrible. ESH. Did you expect your sister to never announce her pregnancy?  I don\u2019t really get it.  Maybe she really only did it to be horrible.  But to be so heartless about a pain you know yourself.  Do you even like each other?", "NTA!  She just got a taste of her own medicine.", "ESH, except your wife.", "Nope you did good my brother \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Sure your response wasn\u2019t kind, but when someone\u2019s hurt you and the person you loved the most a lot then you don\u2019t need to be expected to be the bigger person.", "Esh p", "NTA. People being treated the way they treat others isn't AH behavior in my book, its karma.", "nta, the sister deserved it for making fun of your wife\u2019s miscarriages. there\u2019s a thing called karma and it her her", "NTA. Screw the ESH votes- actively try to upset my wife like that and I'd go scorched earth on them too. Way to have your wife's back.", "ESH. I'd side with your parents. It's a totally AH move, and I totally understand where are you coming from. \nAnd yeah, your sister is a major AH", "ESH (minus your poor wife!) your family sounds like my in laws and i hope i am never cold and unwelcoming or \u201cweirded out\u201d by my child(/ren)\u2018s significant others wanting to hang out and get to know the family. jesus christ. \n\nalso, i get you were trying to defend your wife\u2019s honor and all, but what a fuckhead way to do it\u2026you\u2019re not so different from the rest of your cold, exclusionary family\u2026", "Truly this says it all", "What a pack of lunatics", "You know what has caused an ungodly amount of miscarriages? Covid. not the fucking vaccine", "I agree that the sister wasn\u2019t thoughtless, she was acting with intentional malice. I don\u2019t think the wife needed to be a better person, but I think OP may have been a little overboard. I agree with ESH, but I think there are degrees of assholery and OP\u2019s was significantly less.", "Same, I think the sister absolutely had it coming lmao. The husband is defending his wife and taking her side, I think he\u2019s doing nothing wrong. If the sister didn\u2019t want to be hurt, she shouldn\u2019t be hurting others. Massive L for the sister.", "Because she didn\u2019t want a full blown relationship the second she met op wife which they themselves said she came on to strong like y\u2019all really think the sister made it her life\u2019s goal to hurt op wife", "He parroted her own words back at her? How is he worse? \n\nESH means they\u2019re both assholes, YTA means she\u2019s not an asshole. I can\u2019t fathom how you think him saying the same things to her as she said to/about his wife is somehow unmitigated cruelty but her saying them as well as announcing a pregnancy 2 weeks after a miscarriage is somehow slightly not nice. \n\nPlease explain how he is worse than her, is it because of their genders? \nOr because the sister was rightfully annoyed by the wife pushing boundaries? Cause even you stated that\u2019s a separate issue. \nWhy is the sister in the clear?", "Why haven't you ever actually asked?", "WTF is wrong with you? Knowing the immense pain a miscarriage can have on a woman you showed no care or compassion for your sister. I understand she was rude and quite frankly an AH, but you should have done better.\n\nYes, YTA.", "ESH but I understand why you said it. People need to hear their words back at them and sis sounds like an AH from the beginning. BIL even admitted she was low and is probably sick of her meanness.", "ESH your sister was mean and you retaliated by twisting the knife - the cycle will never end. I think it\u2019s fair to assume that once your parents have passed on that your estrangement will be complete.", "YTA.\n\nShe was cruel, does not validate you being so too. Good neither of you are having children, this is so toxic as it gets.", "ESH Wow everyone sucks here. Your wife was way too pushy at first. Yes maybe SIL \"shouldn't\" hold a grudge for that but she doesn't have to embrace pushy people if she doesn't want to. Announcing her pregnancy to you is not explicitly a dig (you're her brother. What do you expect her to do ...not tell you about it at all until baby arrives?). Her statement after wife was upset at the announcement was horrendous. Your statement after she lost her child was horrendous too.\n\nYall need to learn some communication that doesn't go from 0 to 100 immediately.", "NTA. Based on what is said here, I think it is valid to point out how hurtful someone\u2019s words were when the tables turn against them. You were definitely blunt, but I get it. \n\nHowever, I am very curious to hear the details of how your wife and sister\u2019s relationship became so contentious. It sounds like your sister treats her like utter shit for no reason and then has the gall to act like there\u2019s something wrong with your wife. \n\nAs someone experiencing infertility and MC I\u2019m so sorry for your losses and that things didn\u2019t work out how you originally planned. Sending you peace and acceptance.", "You call your sister petty and accuse her of holding grudges then you go and pull stuff like this? Don\u2019t kid yourself you aren\u2019t any better. \n\nESH.", "NTA", "You\u2019re sort of TA but your sisters definitely TA I\u2019d still say what you did stooped too low but your sister stooped first.", "While it may be deserved, it still doesn't make the OP a non-AH", "You have some issues about annoying family members who forces themselves on things and made things uncomfortable. The SIL historically would not announce a pregnancy publicly.  Then when she miscarried she wanted sympathy.  The sister burned that bridge.", "This comment is so mellow dramatic. OP and his wife (yes both of them) have experienced 3 miscarriages. I don\u2019t expect someone whose experienced that loss 3 fold along with shitty comments from the sister to give grace when she finally gets a taste of her own medicine.", "Sure buddy, crazy how mad people get for asking questions", "We\u2019ll all of them except the wife. Wife literally did nothing except be too friendly", "it\u2019s because she never accepted op wife and even if she didn\u2019t make the announcement with evil, the comments she made later only show that she doesn\u2019t care about her brother and wife pain for their miscarriages she is not the victim just because the situation turned around", "Ok, as someone who left ESH I'll answer your question. Wife in this story is presented as a prop.  So she's not perceived as an active player (at least by me). Although I do have some questions - if you (OP and wife) know that you are not going to get unconditional love and support from the family, why do you let them know about the miscarriage?\nI can speak from personal experience. First pregnancy - we let everyone know. And miscarriage was devastating. All the rest of pregnancies - not a word to the families until it's 13 weeks and genetic screening is ok - and my family is loving and supportive. Them reminding of what didn't come to pass is very painful. So why was the sister in the loop? Who shared with her?", "Ether is op because he sounds worse", "but you are the one who said he is TAH"]}
