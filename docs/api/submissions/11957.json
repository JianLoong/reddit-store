Why in the world would you think it's OK to invite a friend on a family vacation without even talking to your husband? Do you even understand what a marriage partnership means?

He's taking his vacation time off to spend it with you and the family, yet you're trying to force him to spend his vacation time with a woman he doesn't get along with well?

Then you called him a child when he had a problem with it, so that's extra AH points for you.", "YTA! Did you really explain to your friend like oh this is a family trip or does she think sure family by day party by night? And it's weird you asked her to be a fourth wheel on a family trip.

You said this will be his long-awaited freedom from his work and you couldn't prioritize him or his needs at all.\n\nAnd then you responded to his reasoning by calling him childish.

He dislikes this, you respond by calling him a child and refusing to acknowledge he\u2019s right, you made a unilateral decision. \n\nYou are the one with childish behavior, you should deal with the consequences and uninvite your friend.

This was a family trip, why would you think it would be okay to invite your friend - one that your husband doesn't really like?!

Family vacation does not mean just invite your friends. Especially not one that you know your husband doesn't get along with. It almost sounds like you purposely did this to try to force him into being ok with it since you asked her and then just told him.

And be honest as to why - you never bothered talking to your husband about it which was your mistake.", "YTA Sounds like you've brought your husband to babysit your child while you go on a girls holiday.", "YTA so much that this has made it onto Facebook already lol!\n\nOP is trying to turn the vacation into a girls trip with a tag-along babysitter for when she and her party friend want to go out at night.", "YTA\n        Just admit it you & your friend got a thing going on. You cant live without her vagina near", "YTA - if my spouse invited a friend on a trip we were taking our kids on without asking me first (which the answer would prob be no) I\u2019d be livid and also he\u2019d be uninviting said friend. That\u2019s not cool and disrespectful to your husband\n\nEdit to add: I missed that you are choosing to take this family vacation the week your oldest is away at camp? You need to do some serious re-evaluating of your priorities and family.", "Or \"family\", at all.", "I do agree she\u2019s TA however there have been times in my childhood where a soccer camp would be happening the same week as a preplanned family vacation and I had to miss it for the camp, basically I\u2019m just trying to say there could be a million reasons why they couldn\u2019t move the vacation dates that just wasn\u2019t relevant to the question at hand.", "It's not even a FAMILY friend - it is HER friend. \n\nYTA - definitely.", "I think that OP doesn't actually want a family vacation. She wants a girls' weekend but is trying to make it look like a family vacation to pacify her husband and/or justify it to herself. I mean, who leaves out their own kid and invites their bestie without caring about how anyone else feels about it? I don't buy for an instant that left out kiddo isn't hurt as well as her husband, and op seems to give zero craps.", "Cause that is what would happen and now op is mad that she doesnt have someone to look after the kid while her and her friend go drinking and she has to be resoonsable for 9yo while husband gets to enjoy quiet time by himself at home", "She did know he\u2019d have a problem with it which is why she asked the friend first. Huge YTA.", "I'm not even married, and I make every decision with my partner.  Even decisions which really don't concern or affect him at all (medication changes, small purchases for myself, etc.) just because he's my best friend who knows me better than anyone.  I like his input.", ">If she will mostly just be in the same area, soft E S H. It\u2019s not nice to invite your friend without your husband\u2019s consent, but at the same time it\u2019s not like it will really change the vacation from a family vacation.\n\nYou didn't say a reason why the husband is an asshole here.", "The post does indicate that\u2019s the only time the husband can probably get away from work, so it\u2019s probably that or nothing & depending on the kid they may have no interest in going to SF.", "OP is clueless.  OK, I'll give her a hall pass for inviting the friend without thinking to talk about it with her husband...  but the minute that her husband said he was hurt that she was making a unilateral decision without him, and that the friend's presence would change the trip, this should have TOTALLY snapped OP back to reality.  Instead, she's fucking clueless and is digging in her heals.\n\nPetty little me would advise them to just cancel the fucking trip all together, because even if it goes on as originally planned - without the friend - OP is going to pout and ruin the trip.  Husband should just plan a different trip for himself and BOTH kids (not just one) and have an awesome Dad/kid trip.  Leave OP home to hangout with her friend.", "That she knows her husband can't stand.\n\nExtra yta", "So much this.   YTA because you don't invite a wild party girl to a family vacation to go sightseeing.", "Same! Like I don\u2019t just do things without involving my gf in the decisions 9 times outta ten", "They also think it is a 'soft YTA' if the person the husband dislikes is joining on most things. And only because of the babysitting aspect of it not the 'inviting someone I know my husband hates on his vacation' thing.", "Definitely seems like this person wants to favor OPs side but can't quite bring themself to."]}
