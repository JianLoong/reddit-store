Why in the world would you think it's OK to invite a friend on a family vacation without even talking to your husband? Do you even understand what a marriage partnership means?

He's taking his vacation time off to spend it with you and the family, yet you're trying to force him to spend his vacation time with a woman he doesn't get along with well?

Then you called him a child when he had a problem with it, so that's extra AH points for you.", "YTA! Did you really explain to your friend like oh this is a family trip or does she think sure family by day party by night? And it's weird you asked her to be a fourth wheel on a family trip.

You said this will be his long-awaited freedom from his work and you couldn't prioritize him or his needs at all.\n\nAnd then you responded to his reasoning by calling him childish.

He dislikes this, you respond by calling him a child and refusing to acknowledge he\u2019s right, you made a unilateral decision. \n\nYou are the one with childish behavior, you should deal with the consequences and uninvite your friend.

This was a family trip, why would you think it would be okay to invite your friend - one that your husband doesn't really like?!

Family vacation does not mean just invite your friends. Especially not one that you know your husband doesn't get along with. It almost sounds like you purposely did this to try to force him into being ok with it since you asked her and then just told him.
