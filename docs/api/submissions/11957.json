He's taking his vacation time off to spend it with you and the family, yet you're trying to force him to spend his vacation time with a woman he doesn't get along with well?

Did you really explain to your friend like oh this is a family trip or does she think sure family by day party by night? And it's weird you asked her to be a fourth wheel on a family trip.

You said this will be his long-awaited freedom from his work and you couldn't prioritize him or his needs at all.\n\nAnd then you responded to his reasoning by calling him childish.

He dislikes this, you respond by calling him a child and refusing to acknowledge he\u2019s right, you made a unilateral decision. \n\nYou are the one with childish behavior, you should deal with the consequences and uninvite your friend.

CHECK\nYou don't discuss it with your SO first. CHECK\nYou KNOW he doesn't care for this person. CHECK\nAnd on top of it, you insult him!

You are selfish and I am surprised your marriage has lasted if you don\u2019t respect your partner enough to consider his feelings. I would walk if my partner disrespected me the way you did.", "YTA\n\nYou were in the wrong by inviting the friend without asking your husband, especially knowing he doesn't get on with her. And then when he calmly explains to you why he's upset, you double down on your wrongness by saying he's acting like a child?\n\nI seriously can not see how you don't realise you're the AH here? Like, it seems physically impossible for someone to think this is okay. Your poor husband.", ">he responded that making executive decisions for things that involved the whole family without involving him made me an asshole.\n\n\nHe is exactly right.

Just listen to him.", "yta literally how is this a question", "YTA\n\nAny and all vacations together should be talked about and agreed upon.  You should not have invited YOUR friend without consulting your husband.  Especially since you know he doesn't like her! It's on thing to put up with someone you don't enjoy being around for 1 day. It's a while lot of YTA for expecting him to put up with her for a whole vacation! I wouldn't want to go anymore either!", "Easy YTA", "It's a family vacation, you had no right to just decide to invite someone else! Especially someone your husband doesn't like. YTA. He is reasonable, go with your friend instead.", "YTA always talk with the other party when planning stuff, especially when the other party is your spouse and the it's originally a family trip.", "Everyone sucks", "YTA. Why would you invite a friend on a family vacation without consulting your husband? Can he just invite anyone he wants without asking you?", "YTA.  If he invited a friend that he knows you don't like on a family vacation without asking you about it first, you know you would be pissed off.", "YTA. The Audacity.", "YATA. You made a huge consequential decision without consulting your spouse. Your actions communicate to your husband and child that they are not enough.", "YTA BIG TIME. First and foremost, how are you going to invite someone on a vacation that you have planned with your husband without consulting it with him first? You are MARRIED after all. Marriage is two people joining as one. Second, you didn\u2019t even consider your husbands feelings toward this person. Third, if you are really okay with basically kicking your husband out of vacation plans and prefer to go with a friend then ma\u2019am, you are not deserving of this man because you have no respect for him. He\u2019s not acting like a child, he has every right to be upset.", "YTA", "YTA. Your husband is absolutely right: you do not get to make unilateral decisions about who goes on a FAMILY vacation. If you want to go on a trip with your friend, plan a separate trip.", "YTA- I'd be angry and hurt if that happened to me. Your husband is right, and he is NOT the one acting like a child...", "In a world of assholes somehow you stand head and shoulders of today. Today you are YTA of the day.

I don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t realize this.", "YTA.. why would you do that without discussing it with him?  You have ruined the trip, even before it started.", "Wow, you're not very smart for a 30 year old.\n\nWhy do you think it's okay to invite your friend to a family vacation without discussing it with your family?\n\nAt 30 you should have enough life experience to know that certain things will cause friction.", "Excellent point! She is treating the people who are supposed to be her family like they live to serve whatever agenda she has atm. It\u2019s her world and everyone else is just unfortunate to live in it!", "THIS. I can only imagine how hurt I\u2019d be if I went to a summer camp for just one week, and that HAPPENED to be the week my parents and siblings went on a family vacation without me! \n\nAnd they\u2019re planning this for August, in March. So it\u2019s not even like \u201coh this all just happened somehow!\u201d\n\nThere are 3 kinds of vacations. \n\n1. Family trips: all the parents, all the kids. No weird planning to exclude exactly one child.\n\n2. Couple trips: plan for *all* kids to be elsewhere (camp, other family) so the parents can get away.\n\n3. Friend trips, where one or the other parent takes off with their close friends, siblings, etc. Or both halves of a couple with other couples/ friend group. \n      \n\nOP somehow mangled all 3 together and ended up with the worst possible hybrid: a family trip that excludes one kid, a couples trip that has a kid tagging along, a friend trip with a spouse and kid in tow.", "She probably says he\u2019s so amazing because he\u2019s willing to put up with her crap when others probably won\u2019t! \n\nHe was willing to back out of the trip and that STILL wasn\u2019t good enough for OP. Talk about entitled!", "You are correct, but it sounds to me like she wants to have fun with her friend and is hoping with only one step kid to entertain hubby will go along with it.", "The hypocrisy and sheer cluelessness of OP is insane to me.", "This. She wants to go party with her wild friend and needs a sitter.", "Exactly.", "Right. He\u2019s supposed to stay home and babysit while she goes out with her gf. Hubby needs to dump her. Sounds like she\u2019s using him and I bet this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s left him home with the kids while she goes out and plays.", "Yep. That\u2019s probably it.", "OP, when I was 16 my sister and her husband took me to the beach for vacation. Sounds great ! Except I was taken with them so that I could babysit  my 2 year old niece while they went out and had fun. I didn\u2019t really mind because it was a free trip but having your husband along on the trip to babysit is terrible. You\u2019re the double AH.", "YTA \n\nYou should never have invites friend without speaking to your husband first.\nHe is right and the dynamic of the trip has changed.\nYou were selfish and an ahole. \nLet him have his week in peace as you have now ruined his holiday", "YTA.

And something tells me you won't have to worry about taking \"family\" vacations with him much longer.", "YTA\n\n1) You invited a friend your husband doesn\u2019t like on family vacation without consulting him.\n\n2) you are excluding your 12yo from  family vacation by taking it the one week when they are at camp.\n\nThis is such a strange post. I\u2019m wondering if the husband wrote it. It seems odd that anyone who did these things would ask if they weee the AH.", "YTA. What part of family vacation do you not understand? How rude of you to invite someone he doesn\u2019t even like to a FAMILY holiday. You\u2019re the childish one here, not husband", "YTA. She's not family and even if she was a sister she shouldn't be invited with out checking with him first. You are a major asshole.", "The husband should unilaterally make the decision to take just him and his daughter on vacation without you. YTA", "YTA. You are truly thoughtless.", "YTA   The discussion on your friend coming should have been brought up to your husband first. What if he came home and told you his friend was coming and you had no vote?", "YTA\n\nWow. You are so inconsiderate and rude. \n\nI\u2019d be pissed if my partner did that to me.", "YTA. \n\nWait for your daughter's camp to be done. Uninvited your friend.\n\nYou only wanted a girls trip. You don't care about your partners feelings. Nor your children's feelings apparently.", "Why would you ever think that inviting a friend that you KNOW your husband doesn\u2019t like on a FAMILY vacation wasn\u2019t a horrible idea?

This is supposed to be a family vacation and instead you invite someone that he doesn't even like. If your friend comes you will definitely sideline your husband to hang out with your friend. If I was your husband I wouldn't come on the trip either. \n\nWhy did you even marry your husband?\n\nYou need to tell your friend that you misspoke and this was a family trip so she cannot come", "Yta. You asked her without discussing with your husband. And when he is bowing out you call him names.", "YTA, it's a family vacation. Is your friend part of your family? No.\nYou made a decision that affects the rest of your family, no wonder your husband doesn't want to go anymore. In all fairness, I wouldn't be surprised if your kid didn't want to either.", "YTA. Without a doubt.", "YTA, he's totally right, you should have at least checked in with him about what he thought before inviting others on the **family** vacation. Would you have been cool with it if he invited a friend that you specifically don't like and he didn't mention it to you until after he already asked and got a yes?? No you'd be annoyed too because it isn't cool to do.", "I honestly hope this post is a joke.

Why would you invite your friend on a family vacation? Why would you invite anyone on a family vacation without speaking to the other family members?", "YTA\n\nYou know your husband does not care for the company of your friend.  You indicated from the title that it is a family vacation, yet 25% of the family is not coming, and someone who is not even a friend of the family is coming.  This is not a family vacation.  Now your husband gets to spend his vacation with someone he doesn't like, and will be stuck taking care of your child, while you and your friend have a good time.  He is right to be upset, and you need to re examine what a marriage means.  Uninvite your friend, and try to make it up to your real family.", "YTA - Why would you think it\u2019s ok to invite a party animal on a family vacation. That is extremely self centered and rude.  Your husband should just stay home, because it\u2019s obvious he will wind up in the hotel with your daughter while you and your friend party.   Why should he bother?", "YTA.  I think you knew your husband would be unhappy, but you figured he would still watch your 9 year old while you go party with your friend.", "My thoughts exactly!!", "This is such a weird \u201cfamily\u201d vacation, anyway. They\u2019re just going to leave a child out of it? OP can go on a friend vacation if she has extra money to do so. Yta.", "This is exactly what she\u2019s doing. Looking for some girl fun away from home while poor wonderful stepdad is there to babysit.", "Because she plans on hubby being the babysitter while she parties with OP.", "Better yet - plan a separate trip for you and your husband to make it up to him for being TA.  Forget the trip with the friend.  BTW YTA.", "It wasn\u2019t good enough because now she doesn\u2019t have a babysitter when her and her friend go out to party.  You know that was coming.  What single person would want to go on a friends family vacation.", "This. She\u2019s probably only married him to have a part time babysitter.", "True. But I would prioritize my 9 year old having a great vacation with her family over ruining my wife's vacation--because in that case my daughter's vacation is probably ruined too, and I wouldn't want to involve my daughter in that."]}
