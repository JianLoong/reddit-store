He badmouths them all the time, to the point where it becomes exhausting. So as he was badmouthing them, he said something like at least when his grandma dies and he gets his inheritance he will never have to deal with them again. I told him that was a horrible thing to say to which he said that he cares more about the money than any one in his family except for his parents. That\u2019s when I told him he is fucked in the head.\n\nHe spent the next 48 hours berating me, calling me every name you can think of. Texting me nonstop while I was with my family and just being hurtful. Yesterday I texted him Merry Christmas and he responded with a \u201csuck a dick\u201d.\n\nIdk why but that made me madder than at any other point so I told him he is a miserable hateful person and it\u2019s no wonder no one likes him he has no real qualities except for his looks and money.

Bancroft draws on his years of experience as a counselor working with abusive men to shed light on how they deliberately confuse, manipulate, and intimidate their victims to get what they want. Ultimately, Bancroft hopes that readers will use his book to better assert their own humanity and independence, either leaving the relationship or demanding that their partner take responsibility for and change his abusive behavior.\n\nThis guide will break down Bancroft\u2019s insights into the motivations and justifications behind abusive behavior and supplement them with the work of other abuse advocates writing since the book\u2019s publication in 2002. We\u2019ll also provide updated statistics and compare domestic abuse to other forms of violence.\u201d\n\nhttps://archive.org/download/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf\n\nAlso your response sounds like reactive abuse. \n\n\u201c\u201dReactive abuse\u201d is when a perpetrator of abuse deliberately triggers their partner into reacting to their abusive behavior aggressively.
