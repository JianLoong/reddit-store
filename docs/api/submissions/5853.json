About a year ago, he got a boyfriend, and told me to keep him, and his being gay, a secret. So of course I did. \n\nBut yesterday my brother and his BF were home alone with me when my brother had an allergic reaction to something. While his BF didn\u2019t know what to do, I freaked out and called my parents, and my dad from there called 911.\n\nMy brother is fine now. But he\u2019s mad at me because I, by calling our parents, outed him. He said that I could have ruined his life and that he\u2019d rather have died than been outed in the way he was, and it was disrespectful. Our parents are fine with the choices and are saying I did the right thing, but my brother says that he can never forgive me. \n\nOn one hand, I think he\u2019s just wrapped up in the moment and said that. But on the other, I think I did a very bad thing by outing him. I\u2019m not LGBT so I don\u2019t know.\n\nETA: When my parents got home, the BF was still there, and he introduced himself as \u201cJeremy\u2019s boyfriend, Kyle\u201d.

You did what you felt was right to help your brother in a medical emergency. And it WAS the right thing. \n\nFrom your edit, you didn't \"out\" him. If anyone did, he's BF outed him.\n\nEDIT: is your brother mad at his BF for introducing himself as such??", "You didn't out him- you reacted to a medical emergency in exactly the right way. Sure, it wasn't the way he wanted your parents to find out but he'll get over it in time. NTA", "NTA. If you had chosen to not do the call and keep his secret and he died, you would never be able to forgive yourself.\n\nEdit to add: the only way you would be the asshole is if you called your dad and specifically went out of the way to tell him that your brother has his gay boyfriend over. I'm assuming you just told your dad about the emergency and did not volunteer the fact he's gay.", "NTA. For one, you didn't out him, his BF did (Info below). So there's no reason to blame you for outing him, that's just Madness. You tried to save his life, and did the right thing. I hope your brother will realize that soon.\n\n(You say in your Post your parents said you did the wrong thing, I assume this is just a typo?)", "NTA. You were trying to help and potentially saved his life, depending on how severe the allergic reaction was. If your brother can't see that you were just concerned for his safety, then he's stupid. Because there's no point in feeling anything if you're deader than a doornail.", "Missing info: What exactly did you say that outed him? I mean,  he was there with a friend who is male. Why would anyone think this is a gay relationship unless they were (needlessly) told that it was?", "INFO: I am not understanding how you calling your parents about your brother having a severe allergic reaction would out him. Did you say anything else besides he was having an allergic reaction? The presence of his boyfriend by itself wouldn't out him unless the relationship was specified and communicated to your parents.\n\nEdit: NTA - you didn't even out him. This is between your brother and his boyfriend. Your brother would rather blame you so he doesn't have to process what his boyfriend did.", "NTA. Just have some patience with him, coming out is very difficult. You did the right thing and in time he'll see that", "NTA and that's not outing. That's a deeply unfortunate coincidence. Your brother is mad about the circumstances but is being an ass and lashing out.", "NTA, and from your edit *you* didn\u2019t out your brother, his bf did that. Even without the edit tho, tell your brother if *he* would rather die, then he\u2019s a selfish prick for thinking you would just sit by and watch. You literally saved his life.", "NTA\nIt was an emergency and it was an accident.\n\nHe's in shock, and he will come around.", "NTA. You were only concerned about his well-being.", "NTA, in any way. You\u2019ve summarised this pretty well yourself, he\u2019s likely just feeling raw because it\u2019s not how he wanted them to find out. The simple fact of the matter is there was an emergency and you responded in the best way possible. If anyone is TA here it\u2019s him for burdening his 13 YO sister with keeping such a major secret. You did well here OP, and if he keeps on about it I\u2019d ask him to put it in writing that he\u2019d rather die than you call your parents for help \ud83d\ude44", "How on earth you think that you outed your brother I am unsure! Either a shitload of pertinent info is missing or it was his own boyfriend that outted him. Either way NTA but your bro is acting like one.", "NTA\n\nYour brother doesn't automatically get a pass for this kind of shit.\n\nLook at it like this.\n\nJoe and Sally are married. Sally is cheating on Joe with Mark. She and Mark are at a hotel and accidentally start a small fire. Should she call 911 knowing that she will be caught with Mark?\n\nWell, if she wasn't hiding her affair, there's nothing to be caught out doing. \n\nIf you are dating someone in secret, you can't act surprised if the secret gets out. This has nothing to do with being gay or not as you can see by my example. It has to do with lack of contingency planning and readiness. \n\nIf he wasn't ready to be outed, he wasn't ready to be dating. That risk comes with the territory.", "Info: how does him having an allergic reaction lead to you outing him? You're 14 but I'm sure you've been in the habit of saying his bf's name or just calling him friend so I'm confused about why him being gay even came up in the conversation", "NTA at all. I can understand your brother is upset that your parents now know he's gay.. but it's far better than him dying from a severe allergic reaction. It was an emergency, you panicked and didn't know what to do, I'm fairly certain most 14 year olds would have reacted the exact same way. Give your brother some time, he will calm down and come around.", "NTA.\n\nThe only person who \u201couted\u201d him is his boyfriend by introducing himself as such. If his boyfriend had said \u201cOh I\u2019m X, his friend\u201d your parents wouldn\u2019t have known or thought anything of it. \n\nMy son (who has told me he\u2019s bi) often bought male friends home - one of which has now transitioned and is happily married but fathered a child before surgery (her wife, the mother, is bi), another was non-gender-conforming (I never knew his sexuality). My son has however only ever had serious relationships with females so if he hadn\u2019t told me I wouldn\u2019t have known that he was bi. I just accepted his male friends as friends - whether they were ever anything more I haven\u2019t a clue.", "NTA. Outing someone is never the correct thing to do is what people will say right up until there has to come a moment when you out someone. Your brother was having a medical emergency and Kyle was freaked, and you were freaked, and you reacted to save his life. You aren't TA for saving your brothers life even if it had to come at the cost of... admittedly... a pretty big secret.   \n\n\nA few things to consider, you aren't LGBT+ so you don't necessarily know what it takes to actually come out. I was in my thirties when I finally accepted to myself and could tell my family that I was a member of the Alphabet Mafia... but if it had come down to me having that secret shared or dying I would hug the stuffing out of the person who saved my life even if they had outed me. Your brother will get over it as you and your parents show him love and acceptance. An aside however, I know you are young and not fully up on the lingo but maybe don't call your brother being gay a \"choice\" it isn't he has no control over it which is why he feared people finding out. Just let him know you accept who he IS and he will come around.", "Did you explicitly tell them that the guy with your brother was his boyfriend? Or did he introduce himself in a panic while the whole commotion was going on, because the only way you'd be at fault would be if you stopped everything and explicitly told your parents \"hey! btw, this is bro's boyfriend\". but even then you where literally a kid who panicked because your brother was dying.\n\nComing out is incredibly personal and important to many queer people, so I get why your brother may feel \"robbed of his moment\", but at some point he has to realize that the circumstances forced the situation. I'm giving a NTA.", "NTA, you were literally trying to save his life, outing him was obviously not your intention. I hope your brother apologizes very deeply when he comes to his senses and realizes how hurtful he is being.", "NTA", "NTA. Give him time to realize that his parents are ok with it and you did it with the best intentions in mind. Maybe write him a letter telling him how much he means to you and that your first priority was keeping him alive because you love having him in your life. Acknowledge that it must have sucked having to come out that way and if you felt like you had a choice, you would have never chosen that for him. You can apologize for how it made him feel but you don\u2019t have to apologize for doing what you did.", "INFO. \n\nI don't get it. How did your call out him? Sounds more like the boyfriend handled that.", "Aww honey, NTA. \n\nIf he doesn't realise he's in the wrong soon, you can tell him that you'd rather have an angry brother than a dead one, and that your parents would never forgive you if they found out he died because you were scared that someone else might out him? Like nah. You did the right thing, and that kind of secret is really big to ask of a 13 year old. I'm super impressed by you keeping that secret so long, you're a really good brother. He'll come around, don't worry too much.", "NTA.\n\nThe person he should be mad at is his BF.

As an elder gay who came out in the 90\u2019s (a few years before Matthew Shepherd was murdered,) outing people can have deadly consequences. I had friends that were shipped off to concentration\u2026 i mean \u201cpray away the gay\u201d camps after they came out or were outed. That that didn\u2019t happen, is awesome. \n\nYour brother is probably feeling robbed of his \u201cI have an announcement to make\u201d time in the spotlight, whilst you were more concerned about him living long enough for that to matter. \n\nHe\u2019s allowed to be upset that you outed him- and so long as it\u2019s a one time thing- so be it. He can be mad. He can also still be alive. Also yeah, technically his bf outed him- you were just the fulcrum that led to it. I\u2019d recommend apologizing for upsetting him and adding that at the end of the day you\u2019d rather have an out living brother mad at you, than a dead one. That\u2019s love.

I would LC/NC for his reaction Im sorry. You dont treat the person who saved your life this way, you just dont.  People need to effin learn how to treat others. This made me really mad.

Not you. If Jeremy had wanted it kept quiet he should have asked Kyle to say he was a friend.  If he did ask that of Kyle then his problem is with Kyle, not you.

Hi, I'm Jeremy's BF is definitely an outing, but Jem's not upset with Kyle, right? Without that, he'd have at least semi-plausible deniability.
