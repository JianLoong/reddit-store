Now don\u2019t get me wrong I don\u2019t think of this ex ever or anything like that, but it\u2019s a memory box! He\u2019s the first guy I was ever in love with and I personally think you should keep your old love letters \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nI didn\u2019t wanna explain this particularly so I just said never mind/it doesn\u2019t matter. He got instantly defensive that I wouldn\u2019t tell him what the ball is from. I said it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s absolutely nothing to do with him, none of this stuff is. He got more annoyed that I wouldn\u2019t just tell him, I said that I\u2019m allowed to have some private thoughts/memories in my head and don\u2019t need to tell him every little thing! He said we\u2019re married and I shouldn\u2019t have any secrets. I said I wouldn\u2019t keep secrets from him if they mattered or if they were anything to do with him or us, but he doesn\u2019t have to know everything in my head. He said that if it doesn\u2019t matter, why can\u2019t I tell him?! But I feel like by this point I\u2019m proving the principle/point of it so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m giving in now lol.\n\nAITA? Should I have just told him and should I need to share everything that\u2019s meaningful or secretive, even if it\u2019s over a decade old? He sounds like a bit of a controlling dick reading this back so thought I should just clarify that he\u2019s not, but for some reason this just really wound him up!\n\n\n**Update**\n\nHi everyone, thanks so much to those who commented, I enjoyed all the different perspectives and this seems to have been a divisive one!\nJust to address a few comments- no I don\u2019t feel any guilt over the items and I\u2019m not hiding anything lol, I would have just told him in different circumstances but he started with such a weird attitude towards the whole thing and then the demanding nature just made me put my boundaries right up! He had no inclination it was to do with an ex and even if he did he\u2019s not the type to care or feel threatened.\nI think I\u2019ll probably settle for everyone\u2019s shitty here - he shouldn\u2019t have been so demanding and weird but I was also childish making a point by not giving in! \n\nFor anyone wanting an update I still haven\u2019t told him as he\u2019s long dropped it. I expect it\u2019ll come up again in another 5 years which is how long it\u2019ll probably take to get round to sorting out on top of the wardrobe again and I rediscover the memory box \ud83d\ude0f", "created_utc": 1668633138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx6e2d/aita_for_refusing_to_explain_my_memory_box/", "score": 246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was when digital cameras just started getting popular and before the cloud, so I think that\u2019s why I held onto them; photos would be nice but I come from a very photo-heavy family to document memories so that plays a part.

You even get to keep some secrets about your present; you don't stop being a separate person just because you're in a committed relationship.  But something here reads to me as if YOU feel guilty about keeping that item and you're trying to convince Internet strangers that you don't.  At the very least, I can say that there's some friction in your current relationship that seems to be pushing you from maintaining your own boundaries (healthy and important) into being secretive.

You cannot be that threatened by an inanimate object that was in a Box literally collecting dust . OP should ask him about some long lost personal memory of his.

Now, if you could trust that he wouldn't make a big deal of it, you could have told him. I think you didn't because you knew he would either insist outright that you get rid of it or he'd give you so much shit for wanting to keep it that you'd be forced to get rid of it just to keep the peace. \n\nI think this boils down to you not trusting him to respect you.

That\u2019s disappointment she didn\u2019t throw out more and asking for justification for keeping memories.", "I agree op lied by saying \u201coh it\u2019s nothing\u201d and then he got upset bc he knows she doesn\u2019t just keep anything in there- it\u2019s important stuff and it would honestly make me think op still had feelings for that person if I was in husbands shoes.", "Because while this secret may not be a big deal her right to have her boundaries respected *is* a big deal.", "Probably because he isn\u2019t actually interested, he\u2019s **demanding** to know. The \u201cmarried people shouldn\u2019t have any secrets\u201d thing also indicates he does want every little detail. She doesn\u2019t want to get into a whole big thing because he\u2019s always been hurtful about anything from her past that doesn\u2019t have to do with him, so of course she\u2019d play it off, he always thinks it\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d too.", "\ud83e\udd10", "But lying is okay? She tried to say \u201coh it\u2019s nothing\u201d but clearly it has enough value to her to keep it a decade later why not just explain that instead of being secretive?", "I didn't vote, just pushed back on an invalid line of reasoning. The level of big deal of the fact is distinct from the level of big deal of the invasion of privacy, and there was no reason for you to try and equate them besides convincing outside observers with poor reading comprehension that you had a point.", "Also she never says \"oh it's nothing\" that isn't a quote from OP.\n\nShe said:\n\n\"it doesn\u2019t matter...it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s absolutely nothing to do with him, none of this stuff is...I\u2019m allowed to have some private thoughts/memories in my head and don\u2019t need to tell him every little thing! I wouldn\u2019t keep secrets from him if they mattered or if they were anything to do with him or us, but he doesn\u2019t have to know everything in my head.\"\n\nThis is a fair argument and a well placed boundary. And you argue with a straw man \"oh it's nothing\" instead.", "Not sure how it\u2019s invalid just because one may be a more controversial point that the other? Also he didn\u2019t invade her privacy? Push the boundary sure but He asked and got upset she got so secretive. Here\u2019s another point for you tho-she had no issue telling the whole internet the gist, how hard would that have been to tell her husband?", "But see what I\u2019m saying how does it \u201cnot matter\u201d if it clearly is still sitting in her closet a decade later? That is a lie point blank. \u201cOh it\u2019s nothing\u201d and \u201coh it doesnt matter\u201d are pretty freaking exchangeable. They\u2019re trying to make space and her stuff is taking up space so it makes sense \u201cif you wanna keep junk fine but at least let me know it\u2019s not junk to you\u201d bc that\u2019s All he sees since \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d according to her now right?", "\"It doesn't matter what the object is and why I am keeping it, it is not relevant to you or us\" is clearly what OP is expressing. Not, \"the object doesn't matter to me.\"", "NTA. Everyone has a past and it\u2019s yours the only time you have to disclose the past is if it effects your present", "NTA", "NTA. You are a whole, individual person who has a history, and private memories. You deserve to keep a bit of yourself for yourself.  It's weird that he cares so much now when you've had that stuff forever.  It's he deflecting? Does he have shady shit in a secret box?", "\nUpdate:\n\nHi everyone, thanks so much to those who commented, I enjoyed all the different perspectives and this seems to have been a divisive one!\nJust to address a few comments- no I don\u2019t feel any guilt over the items and I\u2019m not hiding anything lol, I would have just told him in different circumstances but he started with such a weird attitude towards the whole thing and then the demanding nature just made me put my boundaries right up! He had no inclination it was to do with an ex and even if he did he\u2019s not the type to care or feel threatened.\nI think I\u2019ll probably settle for everyone\u2019s shitty here - he shouldn\u2019t have been so demanding and weird but I was also childish making a point by not giving in! \n\nFor anyone wanting an update I still haven\u2019t told him as he\u2019s long dropped it. I expect it\u2019ll come up again in another 5 years which is how long it\u2019ll probably take to get round to sorting out on top of the wardrobe again and I rediscover the memory box \ud83d\ude0f", "Nope, none of his business. NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re brave, though. I reread and burned my love letters. Even the ones my husband sent me. I was terrified that my kids would find them someday. \ud83d\ude33", " Your edit states that you put boundaries up because he assumed it was ex stuff...but it was ex stuff. I'm not sure how you don't see the hypocrisy in that statement.", "I love my memory box, so much that I ended up upgrading it to a full on tote since my husband started adding items to it too and it could no longer hold everything in it! (Before I had two boxes dedicated to memories where one was objects and the other papers/pictures)\n\nIt seems so weird to me that hes so... aggressive? About getting the info when if he just chilled out you may have even had one of those memory flashbacks while holding the item and then telling him the story behind it! Just seems weird to me is all\n\nSo NTA and have fun going through it in 5 years again! XD", "So it\u2019s a box of stuff from exes isn\u2019t it", "THIS. If he hadn't already been dismissive and rolling his eyes about the memory box, maybe OP would have felt safer sharing. Husband has only himself to blame and the more intrusive and entitled he acts, the less reason OP will have to want to open up to him about emotional stories from her past. It's so clear that his feelings about it are coming from insecurity, he needs to deal with that instead of taking it out on her.", "This.  NTA", "My husband has things from past relationships. There was certainly no \"hell to pay\". He's a very sentimental man, and I think it's sweet he keeps old love letters.", "NTA. Your private space is yours, whether it\u2019s internal thought processes or a memory box.", "this! i speak from experience. op needs to put it some place safe if she doesnt want to discover its missing.", "This is an interesting perspective\u2026 I would have assumed it was more about the \u201cyou\u2019re dismissive of my sentimental items and then demand to know everything about them\u201d issue, but it is true that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d could sound like a kind of weird overly defensive response\u2026 the husband automatically irks me, though, because I value other people\u2019s privacy so strongly, and if past romantic partners haven\u2019t shared things with my I always took it as obvious that they had corners of their lives that weren\u2019t about me.", "> You're telling him that you don't want to share an important memory with him. You have to see how that might make him feel as though you're hiding something.\n\nOnly because the possiblity of examining his own behavior, and thinking about why being dismissive of the box's existence has caused his wife not to trust him to care about her feelings.  Do her feelings matter? Why does he get to stomp on her feelings just because she's more sentimental than he is?\n\nYou're right, the \"doesn't matter\" was a deflection.  The answer she should have given was, \"I don't trust you not to make fun of me or criticize me for keeping it.  You're planning to hurt my feelings over it, and I'm not going to give you the chance.\"", "> You tell internet strangers but you wont tell your husband?\n\nWe aren't able to badger her into throwing it away.  The few of you here who are willing to guilt her over it will never match up to the guilt he will heap on her.  She can log out of the website and never hear from us again. We're safe to share with, because we just can't hurt her as much.", "That sounds like you projecting _hard_, not anything about OP's behavior.", "Yep! He was demanding she prove it's value to him, trying to force her to justify her possessions to convince him that it's worth keeping around. There was zero actual curiosity and desire to learn and hear about her memory.", "You're probably right. I do like to fiddle with and rub balls on my face while giggling. It's not a big deal though, so please stop thinking about it.", "> Here\u2019s another point for you tho-she had no issue telling the whole internet the gist, how hard would that have been to tell her husband?\n\nIf you don't know the answer to this, you've never been in a loving relationship.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t need to know and it\u2019s really not his business but if it was me I would be honest if asked because idgaf. But I agree his bad attitude didn\u2019t provide a good space to open up.", "Lol this reminds me of everybody loves raymond epsisode.", "NTA", "Sounds like he wouldn't have a problem telling her. I've got a feeling his current attitude stems from the fact that she does little things like this all the time just to get the reaction she wants....then she blames him for getting weird and upset. It works out perfectly for her because she makes him feel petty for asking questions and the cycle just keeps repeating itself. She loves the drama."]}
