You are protecting Allie from her toxic bullying mother. Thank you for being her shield. So many trans kids end up being driven out of their families because no one stands up for them. This means so much.", "NTA. There's enough crap in the world that trans people have to deal with. They don't need their own parents being dicks to them.", "NTA \n\nBut have you tried to tell Tammy about the way you feel toward her transphobic behaviour ? Maybe she refuses to see the problem when confronted to her own daughter, but will be forced to understand your point, or just to consider it, if someone else points it out.", "NTA", "NTA. Regardless of what the transphobic trolls will argue, she is harming Allie by constantly misgendering her", "Definitely NTA. Your sister is going to be a hurtful bully and cause problems. If she can't behave properly then she shouldn't be there", "NTA\n\nBullying has no place. Allie is perfectly within her rights to insist on her chosen pronouns and her mother's behaviour towards her is unacceptable.", "NTA \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure Allie appreciates you standing up for her when no one else will. Everybody deserves a safe space and it\u2019s clear Allie hasn\u2019t had one at home for years.", "NTA Tammy is going to be devastated when Allie tells Auntie when she gets engaged. When Auntie gets to go dress shopping. When Auntie gets to do the mother of the bride everything. When Auntie gets to meet the baby. Allie is lucky to have you. \n\nTammy is a homophobic bully. Homophobic assholes don't get invitations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
