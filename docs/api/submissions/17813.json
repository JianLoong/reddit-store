English isn't my first language so sorry if some things will sound funny to you. \n\nSo I (25F) recently married my fiance (27M). Our weeding was absolutely beautiful and how I always imagined it except for one issue.\nMy older brother (28M) married his wife (28F) two years ago. Their wedding was beautiful but my SIL couldn't afford her dream dress because it was too expensive (it was a designer dress) and had to settle for the cheaper option. \nI on the other hand never wanted a wedding dress, I hate how I feel in dresses and when I was 10 no family member could make me wear one. So instead of a wedding dress I decided to wore a white flared pants with ruffles, similar to the one of ABBAs jumpsuit. On the top I wore a loose white satin top with golden corset. I also had some golden jewelry (my wedding ring of course, necklace and some hair jewelry that complimented my blonde curly hair). I in no way could afford it normally so I started to put some money away every time I had my paycheck for tailor to make my dream outfit and to buy jewlery.\n\nNow to the main story.\nWhen the wedding came I saw that that my SIL was wearing a very VERY pale, almost white, pink dress that looked exactly like the wedding dress she always wanted, just not pure white. She also had jewlery that her grandma gave her (I had no problem with her jewlery).\nI and my now husband confronted my SIL and my brother about this. She said that she decided to do the same as me and started to save money for tailor to make the dress she always wanted and my wedding was the perfect time to wear it since I don't care about dresses. My brother agreed with her.\nEveryone from my family knew that I won't be wearing a wedding dress but in no way I would thing that someone would think it's okay to wear one on MY wedding. It's true, I don't care about dresses but I still wanted to be the most beautiful woman on this day.\nMy mother joined the conversation. She also agreed with SIL (she never agreed with me not dressing feminine). SIL started crying that I tried to upstage her with my expensive jewlery since all she has is old one from her grandma (i said nothing about the jewlery) and that I won't let her have her dream day with beautiful outfit she always wanted. \nAfter all this I started crying too and my husband had to comfort me. Some of the guests, mostly my friends were on my side but most family members said I was exaggerating. \nI tried to ignore her for the rest of the wedding but she was still at the back of my head.\nMy mother and brother said I should apologise to SIL. I don't want to do it. I'm still hurt. But maybe I am really in the wrong? Does my feelings not count? Im writing this while going on the honeymoon to Vietman with my husband and trying to ignore all messages from my family.

Most of your family, including your brother and your mother are on SIL's side. May I aske about the cultural and family dynamics of where you live? Is it because your brother is male that he has a \"superior\" position? And because SIL will be the mother of his son and continue the lineage that she can get away with this crap?
