English isn't my first language so sorry if some things will sound funny to you. \n\nSo I (25F) recently married my fiance (27M). Our weeding was absolutely beautiful and how I always imagined it except for one issue.\nMy older brother (28M) married his wife (28F) two years ago. Their wedding was beautiful but my SIL couldn't afford her dream dress because it was too expensive (it was a designer dress) and had to settle for the cheaper option. \nI on the other hand never wanted a wedding dress, I hate how I feel in dresses and when I was 10 no family member could make me wear one. So instead of a wedding dress I decided to wore a white flared pants with ruffles, similar to the one of ABBAs jumpsuit. On the top I wore a loose white satin top with golden corset. I also had some golden jewelry (my wedding ring of course, necklace and some hair jewelry that complimented my blonde curly hair). I in no way could afford it normally so I started to put some money away every time I had my paycheck for tailor to make my dream outfit and to buy jewlery.\n\nNow to the main story.\nWhen the wedding came I saw that that my SIL was wearing a very VERY pale, almost white, pink dress that looked exactly like the wedding dress she always wanted, just not pure white. She also had jewlery that her grandma gave her (I had no problem with her jewlery).\nI and my now husband confronted my SIL and my brother about this. She said that she decided to do the same as me and started to save money for tailor to make the dress she always wanted and my wedding was the perfect time to wear it since I don't care about dresses. My brother agreed with her.\nEveryone from my family knew that I won't be wearing a wedding dress but in no way I would thing that someone would think it's okay to wear one on MY wedding. It's true, I don't care about dresses but I still wanted to be the most beautiful woman on this day.\nMy mother joined the conversation. She also agreed with SIL (she never agreed with me not dressing feminine). SIL started crying that I tried to upstage her with my expensive jewlery since all she has is old one from her grandma (i said nothing about the jewlery) and that I won't let her have her dream day with beautiful outfit she always wanted. \nAfter all this I started crying too and my husband had to comfort me. Some of the guests, mostly my friends were on my side but most family members said I was exaggerating. \nI tried to ignore her for the rest of the wedding but she was still at the back of my head.\nMy mother and brother said I should apologise to SIL. I don't want to do it. I'm still hurt. But maybe I am really in the wrong? Does my feelings not count? Im writing this while going on the honeymoon to Vietman with my husband and trying to ignore all messages from my family.

Who chooses someone else\u2019s wedding day to look their best and wear a special outfit? Obviously the bride wears the best outfit, the best jewelry, and is the center of attention. \n\nWhat on earth is your sil/brother/mother on? \n\nTell them if sil wanted to have a special day she can host another wedding and be the bride again.", "Your SiL is a massive AH (I would use another word but don't want a ban) and so is everyone supporting her! If she wanted a huge event to show off her tailored wedding outfit that she didn't get to wear to her own wedding then she should've organised one, or waited to their anniversary party like any normal person would've done, not tried to pull that shit at your wedding!\n\nNTA. Ignore anyone saying otherwise and do not apologise to your SiL.", "NTA. Your SIL is a narcissist and an AH.\n\nNo one with an ounce of sense thinks it's okay to wear a wedding dress to someone else's wedding. Not even if it's pale pink. Not even if the bride doesn't wear a traditional dress.\n\nIt was YOUR wedding. Absolutely don't apologize; you are owed an apology, but as you won't get one, let the trash take itself out.\n\nAlso, any family members siding with you AH SIL are AHs in their own right. They're probably in the \"don't rock the boat\" crowd, but you now know that they don't respect you. Remember that.", "I am so flabbergasted.\n\nYOU were the bride.\n\nIt was YOUR wedding.\n\nYou decided to not go with a dress, but you are still THE BRIDE!! (also, by your description, your outfit sounds amazing!!!)\n\nSo SIL decided to save money and buy the wedding dress of her dreams (in an almost white colour) to YOUR wedding. She even cried that YOU, the BRIDE upstaged her jewelry !?! WTF???\n\nShe wanted to steal your thunder and be the bride she couldn't be at HER wedding, at YOUR wedding !?!\n\nAgain; WTF?\n\nWhat amazes me is that there are people who agree with her ?!?!? You guessed it ; WTF ?\n\nAnd now YOU have to apologize to HER while she ruined YOUR wedding?\n\nquadruple WTF\n\nI am so incredibly LIVID on your behalf.\n\nAlso, definitely NTA\n\nWell, look at the bright side: now you know who are truly there for you and you can go NC with the others.\n\nThat'll clean up your social life and you'll remain with only the worthy people.\n\n*Edit:*\n\nQUESTION: your friends and your husband were on your side. Most of your family, including your brother and your mother are on SIL's side. May I aske about the cultural and family dynamics of where you live? Is it because your brother is male that he has a \"superior\" position? And because SIL will be the mother of his son and continue the lineage that she can get away with this crap? Is that why they don't support you and totally disrespected you on YOUR WEDDING day of all days, AND want you to apologize to SIL?\n\nYou are married, you have a husband who supports you. Please don't ever apologize and I'd definitely go NC until THEY apologize.", "NTA\n\nHow the hell is SHE entitled to have HER \u201cdream day\u201d on YOUR wedding day that YOU planned and paid for??!! \n\nThere are 364 other days a year that could be her dream day.

She really has some problems. You are the bride, not her. But i guess she forget it and thought your wedding is her second one.", "Nta that girl is crazy I\u2019m so sorry she did that to you. I can\u2019t believe so many people are enabling this girl", "NTA - your SIL had her opportunity to wear a wedding dress already.  If she wanted another reason to wear her dress, then she should have planned a vows renewal or something.", "NTA - you just don't wear a white dress to someone else's wedding no matter what the couple getting married are wearing (unless they explain otherwise) I'm not sure how anyone could side with your SiL after her comments on you upstaging her with expensive jewellery on YOUR wedding day", "NTA She knew what she was doing, knew it wouldn\u2019t be received the way she wanted, and has no right to be at all upset.

Block and ignore the haters as needed and enjoy your honeymoon.", "NTA but you didn\u2019t have to say anything. Your SIL made a fool of herself by wearing the dress, and everyone was aware of it. By pointing it out you brought her the attention she desired and allowed her to pull the focus away from you and to make herself a victim. If you didn\u2019t say anything she would have needed to pull attention away from you herself and that would have exposed her pettiness to anyone not sure she wore a wedding dress on purpose.", "NTA, but your family are, esp your SIL. She's jealous too, crying over jewelries on your wedding. She can wear her dream wedding dress all day any day anywhere if she wants, but not at someone else's wedding, main character much.

But don't worry, she was definitely laughed at behind her back by most of your guests, and probably thought of as pretty pathetic to boot. I certainly would have thought so. Ignore all the messages and have a fabulous honeymoon OP, and treat your SIL from now on with a distant courtesy. Just let her fade into the background of your life. Be polite but distant. And if you ever have kids tell her NOTHING. Name, stuff you are buying for baby, nothing. Because she will find a way to ruin that too. NTA.", "I would go NC for the rest of my life.
