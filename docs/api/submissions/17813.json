English isn't my first language so sorry if some things will sound funny to you. \n\nSo I (25F) recently married my fiance (27M). Our weeding was absolutely beautiful and how I always imagined it except for one issue.\nMy older brother (28M) married his wife (28F) two years ago. Their wedding was beautiful but my SIL couldn't afford her dream dress because it was too expensive (it was a designer dress) and had to settle for the cheaper option. \nI on the other hand never wanted a wedding dress, I hate how I feel in dresses and when I was 10 no family member could make me wear one. So instead of a wedding dress I decided to wore a white flared pants with ruffles, similar to the one of ABBAs jumpsuit. On the top I wore a loose white satin top with golden corset. I also had some golden jewelry (my wedding ring of course, necklace and some hair jewelry that complimented my blonde curly hair). I in no way could afford it normally so I started to put some money away every time I had my paycheck for tailor to make my dream outfit and to buy jewlery.\n\nNow to the main story.\nWhen the wedding came I saw that that my SIL was wearing a very VERY pale, almost white, pink dress that looked exactly like the wedding dress she always wanted, just not pure white. She also had jewlery that her grandma gave her (I had no problem with her jewlery).\nI and my now husband confronted my SIL and my brother about this. She said that she decided to do the same as me and started to save money for tailor to make the dress she always wanted and my wedding was the perfect time to wear it since I don't care about dresses. My brother agreed with her.\nEveryone from my family knew that I won't be wearing a wedding dress but in no way I would thing that someone would think it's okay to wear one on MY wedding. It's true, I don't care about dresses but I still wanted to be the most beautiful woman on this day.\nMy mother joined the conversation. She also agreed with SIL (she never agreed with me not dressing feminine). SIL started crying that I tried to upstage her with my expensive jewlery since all she has is old one from her grandma (i said nothing about the jewlery) and that I won't let her have her dream day with beautiful outfit she always wanted. \nAfter all this I started crying too and my husband had to comfort me. Some of the guests, mostly my friends were on my side but most family members said I was exaggerating. \nI tried to ignore her for the rest of the wedding but she was still at the back of my head.\nMy mother and brother said I should apologise to SIL. I don't want to do it. I'm still hurt. But maybe I am really in the wrong? Does my feelings not count? Im writing this while going on the honeymoon to Vietman with my husband and trying to ignore all messages from my family. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I have a minute to answer some questions, im really grateful for all your answers, they made me realise im the sane one here! haha\nI might not be able to answer every guestion tho i will try\n- No, my brother is not a golden child, my parents always treated us equally but it's true that he was the one that got better grades, better looks and was more athelic but i never felt worse than him, we both were very much loved.\n- My mother never felt good with me not wanting to wear a shirt or dress, every time we would go to more elegant place or i would go on a date she said that i should stop acting childish and start dressing like a real woman.\n- I think this situation at my wedding exploded because of my own earlier words -  my whole life I said, against my mother, that eyeryone should dress what makes them comfortable and not look at what others think - i believe they used my words against me.\n- I always had good relation with my SIL, we were i could say not close friends, she makes my brother happy, why would i not like her, we also would sometimes joke around. I don't know what made her do this - maybe she thought we were closer? \n- you are right, everyone can feel beautiful at a wedding, i used wrong words, im sorry for this\n- after i come back with my huband i will try to keep distance with my family but i don't want to loose all contact", "created_utc": 1684659882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nnx9x/aita_for_upstaging_my_sil_at_my_wedding/", "score": 478, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd like your mom to explain what it is that she thinks you should be apologizing for, because it seems like all you did was not be OK with somebody doing something that is not ok.", "NTA. She wore a bride-like dress to someone else\u2019s wedding then cried because the bride had flashier jewelry on the bride\u2019s wedding day. I can\u2019t help but wonder what\u2019s missing because how would anyone think that is okay?!", "NTA- I would\u2019ve kicked her out on the spot", "NTA.  I burst out laughing at the title of this.  Say what?  Remind mom that it's your wedding and not SIL's wedding.  It's not SIL's dream day.  Tell her also to stop encouraging SIL's self-centered nature.  Does your mother not love you?  Tell her you will not apologize to her and if she has a problem with it, she can stay away.  I feel that your brother is the golden child.  Am I right?", "If you really think that there is any possibility that *you* are TA in this situation, I recommend therapy to undo the damage your family must have done. NTA.", "NTA.\n Your Sil is a selfish asshole and your mother needs a reality check", "NTA\n\nIt was YOUR WEDDING DAY!!!\n\nOf course you should be the best dressed and outshine everyone!\n\nWTF is wrong with your SIL?", "NTA. This is insane. She should have saved it for a vow renewal or something", " NTA wow..your family Sucks.", "NTA at all. Your main mistake was not kicking them out immediately and anyone who was siding with SIL. I would go NC with the lot of them.", "**I think it is time you start wearing dresses !!**  \n\nSpecifically a wedding dress to every special event of every person who agrees with your Mom and SIL.  See how they feel when you just want to have a special day with a dress cause you never got one, and the days you choose just happen to be their days. \n\nNTA- serve up that revenge cold and often!", "*\"I decided to wore a white flared pants with ruffles, similar to the one of ABBAs jumpsuit. On the top I wore a loose white satin top with golden corset. I also had some golden jewelry (my wedding ring of course, necklace and some hair jewelry...\"*\n\nThis I gotta see.  Photo?", "NTA. HER dream dress on HER dream day aka YOUR WEDDING?!?!?! You shouldn't apologize for anything and instead should demand an apology from her? Who does that sort of thing?!", "NTA at all.\n\nSil wore a wedding dress to your wedding. She and anyone who took her side can go kick rocks. She wore a WEDDING DRESS to someone elses wedding. \n\nIt's not your fault that she didn't get her dream dress for her wedding. Your wedding is not her do over. She is so out of line.", "\u201cWhy can\u2019t you let me have a special day\u201d on someone else\u2019s day. NTA\nSIL is attention seeking and your family is encouraging it", "I wonder why u didnt kick ur bro and his wife out of wedding????\n\nNTA, But your Brother, SIL and your mother definately are AH.", "NTA! Your wedding, your day! SIL is in the wrong and should apologize to you! If she wants ANOTHER special day she can renew her vows but she doesn\u2019t get to wear her dream wedding dress on YOUR wedding day! I don\u2019t care if you walked down the aisle in a potato sack\u2026you still get to be the most beautiful woman on your wedding day.", "Your SIL is an AH but the point of a wedding is to celebrate a union, it\u2019s not about you wanting to \u201cbe the most beautiful woman\u201d on the day. You sound very immature and do does your SIL. ESH.", "You need to send one text to everyone in your family stating once and for all that her behaviour was outrageous and she needs therapy and can only enter your house if she is on her knees flaggelating herself. Omfg.\n\nNTA!", "NTA. SIL looking like a crazy person at your wedding in no way took away from your outfit. I\u2019m sure you looked amazing. I\u2019m sure she looked crazy. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone an apology. SIL owes you one but I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t give it. Just limit your contact with her.", "I think wearing your best outfit to a wedding is fine, but not when it looks like a wedding dress!", "> Is your sil unhinged? Who chooses someone else\u2019s wedding day to look their best and wear a special outfit?\n\nWaaay way too many guests of OPs in this sub.", "Agree. And even excluding the fact OP didn't wear a dress, apparently the SIL was upset that OP \"DELIBERATELY upstaged\" SIL with the jewelry she wore. So that had nothing to do with the dress and was just SIL being upset or jealous (or both) about how OP looked.", "You have nothing to apologize for. Their request is ridiculous. If they insist, stop spending any time or energy on them.", "we are here to make judgement, not pretend we are holier than thou. OP can do whatever she wants with her phone. Like YOU can get off your phone.", "Thus sure she will wear her dream dress but there is no proof.", "I think Mother of the Bride wanted to punish her daughter for not dressing \"femininely\" or at least not traditionally.", "I think OPs brother is the golden child.", "I think most of OP's family is and she is the only one with a normal moral compass!", "I feel the same way. This is so petty. Everyone can look beautiful at a wedding, it's not just for the bride.", "And/or internalised misogyny is a smasher. The mother can't stand OP doesn't conform to gender norms, and meanwhile SIL turns up wearing what the mother believes OP should be wearing.", "by all means SIL can be beautiful at the wedding.  but she was purposefully and unnecessarily tryna stand out and complaining bout stuff that had nothing to do w/ her because it wasnt...HER wedding.  SIL needs to have a seat \ud83e\ude91 and \ud83e\udd10"]}
