So this happened a while ago when I was 19 and living on my own. I had mad a Netflix account (along with all the other streaming services) when I got my apartment. It was the membership where only 2 people could use it at once. I gave my info to my friend to use and asked my friend not to give it out to anyone and she fully respected my wishes.  \n\nI was talking to my mom who has most streaming services but not Netflix. Since I worked overnights at a 24 hour grocery store and only used my Netflix on my days off when I was awake throughout the night I offered her my sign in info with the same expectations: don\u2019t give the log in to anyone, and only have it signed in on her bedroom TV (she lived with other people and I didn\u2019t want it on the communal TV because idk their schedule but knew my mom always slept through the night so no one would get kicked off). She agreed and was very thankful.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. My friend uses it to binge anime and only anime. That\u2019s the only reason she wanted it. My mom has always only watched specific types of shows and movies. I go to use my Netflix one night and can\u2019t sign in because two people are using it. I think nothing of it and assume my friend, who also works overnights,  is watching and my mom couldn\u2019t sleep. Whatever, I go to Hulu. The next day I go to use Netflix and again, locked out. I\u2019m a little confused at this point. The third night comes and I ask my friend to send me a screenshot of the \u201ccontinue watching\u201d screen since I can\u2019t get in still and I\u2019m getting suspicious. She sends it and I notice a show that none of us would ever watch (not my friend or my style, mom hates the show). (Side note, I asked my friend if she was watching just in case and she said no, I believe her because she\u2019s never lied to me and is always respectful of other peoples stuff and boundaries)\n\nNext day I text my mom and ask if she gave out my Netflix information. She said no. So I tell her I haven\u2019t been able to get on because too many people are using it and point out the show that seems out of place. She gets quiet. So I ask her again. She gets mad and starts yelling at me for \u201cmonitoring\u201d her and acting like a stalker by checking the shows that are watched. She admits that someone else in the house wanted to watch the Netflix specific show so she logged into it on the living the room TV for that person but \u201cdidn\u2019t give out the info\u201d. I told her she was only supposed to have it in her bedroom for this specific reason. She said I was being selfish and creepy for noticing the show and I was \u201cdisrespecting your mother\u201d. No apology. \n\nIn the end I changed the log in info and only told my friend. Mom texted me several more times for being a horrible daughter. I feel like I may be the AH for being so strict with my account\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673669268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10beyqc/aita_for_monitoring_my_netflix_account/", "score": 557, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't 'monitoring' it, you were trying to use a service you pay for any weren't able to, so you looked into why. Completely different, and perfectly reasonable. You're not a 'horrible daughter', you're a reasonable adult who set two very simple rules in order to use the service you pay for yourself, and cannot trust someone who immediately broke one of those two rules and defended their actions by claiming it was a loophole to the other rule.\n\nYour mother will live without Netflix, or can her own, since she cannot respect your very clear and simple rules for sharing. I expect her vitriol is because she's getting earache from the housemate that was likely under the assumption that it was your mom's account (and maybe had offered some recompense in kind), and now she has to admit she didn't have the right to share it and won't get it back for them to use.", "NTA and your mom has some adept gaslighting skills there.

That's poor security practice and it has resulted in you being unable to use your membership despite being the person paying for it!\n\nThey should allow you to link the accounts of people with whom you wish to share your membership and then allow you to temporarily kick any of them off if you want to watch something and too many linked accounts are already watching something.\n\n>In the end I changed the log in info and only told my friend.\n\nI was just about to suggest that.

You\u2019re trying to be able to use the service you\u2019re paying for. Your mom violated your agreement, otherwise there would be no issue.
