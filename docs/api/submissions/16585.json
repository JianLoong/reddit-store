So an excuse to see me?", "I told him before I moved away that I didn\u2019t want to do long distance and ended it with him then and there. Since then (6 months) I have had no feelings for him and he turns up at my workplace to surprise me, assuming that I would still have feelings for him, but alas I don\u2019t. We were chilling at mine when I asked where he was staying and he said \u201coh I was just gonna stay here with you\u201d.

You both need space especially so he can move on without you.", "You\u2019ve been nice enough inviting him into your home and making your feelings clear, but it is unhinged behaviour turning up to an ex\u2019s workplace halfway across the country with the belief they still have feelings!

Why did you agree to him sleeping at your place at all?
