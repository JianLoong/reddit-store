If you couldn't go because of the expense, or because of your fear of flying, then I could understand. But you're not going because you say you won't know anyone at the wedding? That's not true, you'll know the bride. The wedding is supposed to be about supporting your friend.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t spend that much money either to barely see the bride (lets face it, you won\u2019t get to spend much time with her) and not know anyone there. Anyone who thinks you should suck up the no plus one in this case is probably in a relationship lol and wouldn\u2019t go if they couldn\u2019t take their partner with them.", "NAH.\n\nYou're well within your right to decline attending a wedding where you may not feel comfortable socially. \n\nHowever, its not uncommon for people not to give out plus ones to single people. I can understand why your friend is hurt that you won't be attending.", "NTA. A wedding invitation is just that\u2014an invitation. It\u2019s not a summons. \n\nIf you invite people who don\u2019t live nearby, you have to expect that they may not be able to travel to your wedding, due to time or money constraints. It\u2019s not necessarily a reflection on how much they value the relationship. \n\nRemember, the people living in the town where your wedding is only have to give up the day; people coming from another continent will need extra days for travel in addition to the added cost. \n\nSo unless your friend has a Star Trek type transporter, she is being unreasonable.", "NTA, asking someone to come to an event that involves such a high travel cost means you can\u2019t take it personally when they say they can\u2019t come. You did the right thing by RSVPing no rather than asking her to make an exception for you. Can\u2019t eat your cake and have it too", "NTA.  First off, it costs money for travel and incidentals.  Transatlantic is not cheap. Secondly, there is still a virus around. Is it worth spending all that money to get yourself sick?", "NTA. Just the cost of flights alone would be enough of a reason. Tell her it works both ways and if she wants to see you she can make the flight to England, or pay for your flight to Canada for the wedding. Sounds like this friendship has run its course. Sad, but it happens. At least you didn\u2019t spend money on the flights.", "NTA, but frankly you never should have told her your reasons. \n\nI'd have just said - I can't, I can't get the time off work, I can't afford it, blah blah. \n\nGiving her a  reason like \"I'm single and don't want to be alone and don't know anyone\" sounds like you can't put aside your discomfort for her. It doesn't sound like she's a good enough friend for you to want to do that. That's OK, but I'd have made some other socially-polite excuse and sounded like I was REALLY REALLY SORRY I couldn't be there instead.", "NTA - the bride probably doesn\u2019t realize that you\u2019ll be very very alone as the she will have very limited time with you. You politely declined and she got butt-hurt that she couldn\u2019t say \u201cmy friend came all the way from England.\u201d", "NTA - travelling to a foreign country is scary and you are footing the bill anyway. If you really desperately want to go (not that i'd actually want to go after this) get a friend who's willing to go and ham it up with your fake date.", "NTA -  Fuck her", "NTA - weddings aren\u2019t mandatory, especially if you live in different countries and haven\u2019t seen each other in years.\n\nNo excuse needed.", "NTA - but you should have just told her you couldn't make it.  No is a complete sentence.\n\nProviding a reason gave her a way to try to bully you into coming, and it seems she is running with that.\n\nStand by your decision - you WON'T BE AT HER WEDDING.", "INFO Why not just say you can't go because you can't afford it? If you don't have a partner it's weird to \"expect\" a plus one. No one has to attend any wedding but I understand why your friend is upset that you said you weren't going because you don't have a plus one.", "NTA, if she badly wanted you to go, she could have tweaked her plus one rules a little and let you come with someone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If the latter you could always bring someone with you then just go to the wedding alone and they could find something else to do for a handful of hours.   \n\n\nThe flights/travel would be a pretty understandable no I think.", "NTA.\n\nAny destination wedding (and for you this qualifies as such) is a huge ask, and it feels like a +1 should be automatic since not everyone can or wants to travel solo. If she's guilt tripping and now giving you the silent treatment I wonder if she saw you as a gift and nothing more. A real friend would get it - disappointed, sure, but understand.", "NTA.  An invitation is never a summons.  She should learn to take a gracious no.  The cost of travel and covid concerns is plenty of reason to decline.", "Huh, is it common for people to expect guests to fly to another country for a wedding? Even with a plus one that's kind of a big commitment and like, great if someone wants to do that, but I'd be more suprised at the guests that were coming than the others. But maybe in the UK/Canada flying is more common?\nAnyway, NTA.", "INFO: How close are you with this friend? How many people will be at the wedding (like, is it a very tiny wedding where your absence would be more noticeable than if there were a lot of guests)? Will your budget be seriously affected by this wedding, or is it just an inconvenience? Has she traveled to England to visit you and/or support you at some important time in your life? \n\nAlso, when you said you wouldn't be coming \"because of the above reasons\", what was your wording/tone like? Did you imply that you were angry that she didn't give you a plus one, or that it was wrong of her to do?", "INFO & YTA. I am confused on the issue of going alone to a wedding. First off, you can always invite a sibling, a friend, etc. Also, you may not know anyone else, but you know HER. Sometimes you got to suck it up and support your friend on HER day. Flights and accommodation are a more understandable concern, but if your friend really wants you to go, she can help you out. Frankly, it seems more like you just do not want to go to the wedding, and you are just making excuses.", "Nah fuck that. The bride to be should be more accommodating, but if that\u2019s not possible the appropriate response is \u2018I love you, I\u2019ll miss you on my big day but I respect your wishes\u2019 not acting like a jerk about it. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA", "And she'll basically see the bride for two minutes (if she's lucky) on the day of. Its intimidating enough going to a wedding where you won't know anyone for a lot of people, let alone having to navigate it solo on top of probably being out almost a grand for travel expenses alone for the privledge. I'd imagine most people would pass for the same reasons as OP.", "I didn\u2019t quite word it like that. I just told her that whilst I understood the plus one rule, I\u2019d have felt more comfortable with one given the travel and it basically being a destination wedding for me.\n\nI do get your point though.", "It's actually easier than some people might think depending on actual disposable income and job flexibility. It's not unheard of for upper middle class families to do it once a year", "I can\u2019t invite someone else to come with me though - I don\u2019t get a plus one.", "You didnt read,\nplus ones are only allowed for couples.\nAlso the bride will barely have time for her.\nAnd she \n\nAnd its just a friend, not best friend or something like that.", "Speaking from memory\u2026I briefly recall seeing a lot of people at my wedding, but I did not get to spend a meaningful amount of time with anyone. Most of the night is a wonderful blur with specific moments that stand out. So it doesn\u2019t matter she knows the bride since the bride wont have time to focus on her anyway. OP did the right thing by RSVP\u2019ing no and not requesting a plus one. NTA, OP.", "But see it from her point of view. She invites a good friend to her wedding. Her friend isn't seeing anyone. Weddings can be fun and you can meet people, and be a tourist for a day or two in a new country if you wanted. Instead, her good friend says  \"I wouldn't know anybody\". It sounds like a weak excuse and that you're thinking only of YOUR feelings and not hers. It's OK if that's what you want to do, but there's lying, and then there's white lies.", "Do you have any single friends? Pretend to be a couple with one of them and hang out at the wedding with them. There are a few options.", "Ok, I did read. I must have misread that portion, I apologize. Still, by the way the friend reacted it seems they are close somehow. Maybe if the friend does a zoom call for the wedding for those who cannot show up it would be a little easier?", "It's too late for that if the invitation arrived without a plus one. You can't just call the bride up and demand another place setting just because you started dating someone.", "Fair enough then", "I do think this conversation could have been handled better."]}
