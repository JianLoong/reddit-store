He\u2019s not just rude he\u2019s a controlling bully!", "True. To be clear, it wasn't a snarky or nasty look. It was a bit of a raised eyebrow and she knew what I meant and smiled. She throws the same look to me all the time if we're with my friends and she wants me to leave the conversation. But yes, could probably have been more clear on attempt 2.", "Every other couple massage we've done have been silent. We've also had ones where she's been tired and fallen asleep and been pissy at me for chatting with my masseuse at the time.", "I actually had booked a facial for gf a couple of days ago whilst I worked. I'd mentioned beforehand that I'm looking forward to relaxing, plus we have had ones before where she wanted to relax and got pissy at me for joking around. We're also abroad for the pitch and she's with me, if that matters at all.", "Why\u2019s he gotta buy her another massage?  She got her way during the first one as far as I\u2019m concerned. \n\nHe should have gone himself to begin with. He was trying to do something to unwind and include her in it. She knew that. She didn\u2019t care. He was a jerk about it. It\u2019s all a mess.", "I will def do that next time. I'd bought her a facial at a 5* hotel the other day whilst I worked on the pitch. We've also had the situation in reverse where I was chatting to the masseuse and she got pissed because she was trying to sleep. So maybe that is the best way forward from now on, even though I'm sure she'll take it personally", "Fair summary. Something for us to work on as a couple, for sure.", "Fair summary. It wasn't a snarky look, just to clear that up. We often use a little glance and we know what each other means. She often gives me a look when with our friends which is the \"let's go, I'm tired\" signal and I read it and we leave. It was the exact same signal and she just decided to ignore, even though she knew that I had booked it to just relax in peace.\n\nThe frustration is essentially coming from my perception of the double standard of our non-verbal communication. It's not really aimed at the masseuse at all.", "we're abroad and I'd bought gf a facial whilst I worked. Treating myself to a massage whilst she bummed around a foreign country alone would have caused a huge fight and I wanted her to share my relief/celebrations after a month of having to prioritise work over us", "because every previous couples massage where she's wanted to chill and I've been chatty has ended with me getting some kind of admonishment", "yeah, I think maybe the stress took its toll and I felt gf was intentionally unaccommodating and lost it.", "Masseuse didn't really speak English well enough (and my accent is difficult to understand for English speakers) so was hoping gf could mention something.", "Then she\u2019ll be free to book and pay for all the Chinese-language massages she wants. \n\nEveryone wins.", "no it's that I couldn't say in English that I'd like some quiet as I didn't know masseuse would understand so needed gf to communicate for me. \n\nShe knew I was stressed and wanted peace from the nonverbal communication (that she uses on me often) and chose to ignore it. It's not about the language, it's that I help her out of a situation when she gives the look of \"you can see I'm frustrated, help me out\" but when it's in reverse, she just carried on regardless knowing it was getting under my skin.", "I was actually referring to myself as the zoo animal in that analogy, being a bit larger than I used to be. Plus, the actual zoo is about 10m from where we were. And I don't think the masseuse spoke English enough to understand me which is why I was hoping gf, who knew all the context, would have relayed the message for me.", "Why isn't it all about him? He's the one who needed big-time stress relief, he's the one who booked it, he's the one paying for it. He invited gf along. She should be cognizant and respectful of why he booked it in the first place. But she kept chatting away, oblivious to the whole purpose of the session. \"It's not all about you\" applies to the gf. NTA.", "The context of peace and quiet etc was clear beforehand. Gf had even suggested it and said she's looking forward to me de-stressing. When I made the first comment, she'd said why don't I go to another room. My response was that I'm not the one making the noise but she can if she wants and she said \"fine, will be quiet then\" and then carried on chatting away.", "I was genuinely ok with a few bits here and there. It was just constant and gf knew I just wanted to sleep and chill. It's happened in reverse and she threw a fit at me for ruining her peace.", "she'd said a few times that she's looking forward to me being able to relax and we've had massages before where she was tired and got pissed at me for chatting to the staff", "yeah, fair. The pitch was overseas and I've spent 2.5k on hotel, facial for her (as I was working), dinners etc all to make up for me working so hard on this pitch\n\nThis was my treat for us, post pitch, which she knew was meant for me to just wind down. I know she knew my point from the first glance (which wasn't a snarky glance or anything like it) and she basically ignored it which got me from relaxed to irked pretty quickly. \n\nBut yeah, I could have dealt with it better", "I'm in Asia", "How is glaring and sighing a direct request?", "Lol.... and \u201cfuck off to the zoo\u201d is an entirely appropriate direct response in this situation hahaha", "If 5 times with escalating frustration didn't get the point across, asking politely is unlikely to have either.", "Yeah, that's fair. Thinking it through, my frustration came from the feeling that when she gives me this look (which wasnt snarky, it was a glance between a couple) when we're with my friends, I understand what she wants and I wrap up the chat and we go home. \n\nWhen I do it to her (not just in this situation but in others too), she decides to ignore it and carry on doing what she wants. I think that frustration from other events, plus the stress, git me from 0 to 100 much quicker than it should have.", "yeah you're right, I'll do that next time. I've actually suggested that before and ended up getting it in the neck from gf that I didn't get a room together. But will push for that in future to avoid this. And also being more patient, of course.", "the language element is relevant because I couldn't communicate the requirement for a bit of peace by myself. If it was a sports massage (or any other time tbh, we've had other massages where she's chatted to the masseuse and I had no issue), I wouldn't care. \n\nShe knew that I was really looking forward to relaxing after a really busy month.\nAlso, we're abroad for the meeting (I paid hotel and for a facial for her whilst I was busy working, spent about 2.5k usd this weekend) and this was the one thing I did for myself post pitch to wind down", "we're abroad for the pitch (i brought her with me as a gift), I've been working hard so wanted to share the celebration with her rather than being selfish and enjoying it whilst she pottered around in a foreign country alone", "yeah, that's true. I'll apologise", "I hope so too op deserves better than an inconsiderate gf.", "who am I fighting? I've added a bit of context to some points and openly said I could have done better about 5 times", "And if those non verbal signals fail, as they sometimes do, a simple request is in order. Further, that massage therapist is not dating you - simply asking her to refrain from talking during your massage from the beginning would have solved your whole problem.", "Why didn't you tell the massage therapist  that you'd appreciate no talking during the massage?", "I\u2019m not a fan of non verbal signals being an expectation. Simply explain that you have had a long ass day and want quiet it\u2019s not that hard.", "Is being rude and snarky your signal? YTA. Why does your need to have abesolute silence trump her wanting to have a pleasant conversation? You sound whiny, demanding, and difficult.", "Is the masseuse part of your relationship? Is it a throuple? \n\nYour girlfriend was being kind to the masseuse. The masseuse didn\u2019t understand your nonverbal signals. Use your words next time. You clearly know how to what with your super important business pitch.", "Am I supposed to be moved by this lack of human decency?", "A look meant to shut people up is clear AH behavior  (and frankly, even if you and your GF do it all the time the masseuse isn't going to know that). Use your words.", "But weren\u2019t the both of you in the middle of your respective treatments when you gave her this look? Did she even see you properly? (Not that I\u2019m agreeing that a *look* is sufficient here.)", "I think the \"look\" is being misinterpreted somewhat. It wasn't snarky or passive aggressive.", "I'd say NTA for blowing up at the end, but you could've been more mature and level headed from the start. Just calmly telling your gf you want to relax and to please stop would've been much better. You were passive aggressive as fuck and that's not how adults communicate", "You should have made that clear if you were going to be a massive jerk about it. \n\n\"I'm paying for your massage on the express condition that you remain COMPLETELY SILENT THE ENTIRE TIME. Don't breath too heavily or else this baby's gonna throw a tantrum.\"", "then you really wanted 2 massages at the same time, not a couples massage", "So you could have booked separate rooms then.  A couple's massage in the same room involves talking, if it doesn't then you should book separate rooms so you don't have to talk.", "USE YOUR WORDS!  Not glances, sighs, 'babe'.  You could have avoided all this.", "Why ask if your the AH then argue with every single person?\n\nOh my god. \n\nYTA\n\n\u201cHey could you guys please stop talking for a bit I\u2019d really Kirk to have done silence during this massage\u201d \n\n\nAnd this is when you say \u201cbUt ThE lOoK WaSn\u2019T eVeN pAsSivE aGgResSivE\u201d\n\nYTA", "I just think the two of you just need to communicate before hand. \"I'm heading down for a silent massage, do you want to join for the same?\" If you both like peace and quiet, then it should be discussed no socializing I guess? Or perhaps just do your own thing separately going forward. I don't think the request for peace and quiet is what makes you the AH. I think that happened once you snapped. I'll give you a ESH though based on you saying your GF has done the same when she wasn't getting the peace and quiet she wanted either. I'll edit original ruling.", "He doesn't have to. I would, because whenever I grump unnecessarily at people I care about I tend to buy them nice things to make up for it, but a sincere apology would be plenty", "Well if you both do it, hopefully you can both be understanding of each other and this won't be a big issue. Best of luck in all your future massage endeavors", "need to stop doing couple's massage", "Dude, something for YOU to work on. Not her. YOU.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I'd really like to relax so can we please keep it quiet for the rest of the massages? Great, thank you so much.\"\n\nLearn to use your words, JFC.

It was time to ask both of them to stop.", "ok....so why get a couples massage instead of 2 separate massages?", "You need to add this info to your opening post. To most of us reading the expectation of quiet time is anything, but obvious. If you have a norm/ agreement that massage time is quiet time, then it needs to be spelled out. If you didn't have an agreement, then it should have been spelled out between the two of you.", "it sounds like neither of you know how to communicate with each other. couples therapy.", "It\u2019s also really not fair to swear at service workers like that. They really can\u2019t say anything back. Not cool, dude.", "Info: what country were you in when it happened?", "So why didn't you go to another room?", "Honestly, to me this is a clear ESH situation.  You were absolutely an AH because of the passive aggression and the way you handle the situation.  But I don't understand why no one is considering the GF an AH too.  \n\nYou treated her to a free massage, with the understanding that this was to be a relaxing experience.   I would think it obvious that if you are paying for an experience that includes certain sounds, that conversation would be discouraged.  Once she knew that you were annoyed and wanted quiet (even if you expressed that in a very immature way), she chose to ignore that and CONTINUE talking.\n\nAnd then she tells YOU to go to another room??  When you paid for the massages and this was essentially your thing that you invited her along to?  And she's the one causing the disturbance in the first place?  That would have royally pissed me off. \n\nAgain, you are quite firmly an AH, but the GF was too.  Sounds like a bunch of selfish and passive aggressive nonsense from both sides.", "Then, she is also the asshole. Both of you could have dealt with it better.", "I get it. A few comments wouldn't have been a problem for me too. And I see why you got annoyed. As I said perhaps you could have chosen a different way of expressing you were unhappy with the way the massage was going.", "The first glare wasn't snarky. It was received with a smile and she knew what I meant. 2nd was a bit passive aggressive, I admit, but I certainly didn't lead with that.", "OP made clear requests earlier, therefore, glaring could have been understood as another attempt to stop chatting.", "It is not. Absolutely not. OP should have handled things differently. The gf and the masseuse were out of line. And more importantly he had asked to stop talking before using such response.", "I admit, that wasn't great. Definitely could have handled that better.", "Did you even read the post?", "I'm not sure she spoke English well enough for me to have landed that point which is why I was reverting to gf to relay the message. Gf knew exactly what I was aiming to achieve and ignored which is why I got irritated. But agreed, could have led without the original comment and probably have had a better result, I admit.", "I'd said to gf before that going in. And whilst I broadly agree, after a while of being tgt, I think nonverbal communication is as clear as verbal communication.

I think I got irritated quickly because I knew she knew what I was saying and she just wasn't bothered", "yeah but the masseuse, as far as I know, didn't speak great English and I was hoping gf would communicate the message.
