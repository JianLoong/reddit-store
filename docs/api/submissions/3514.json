I am exhausted and I just need to destress. As a treat, I bought a 2hr full body massage for myself and my gf, full whale music and everything. \n\nMassage was great apart from the fact that my gf's masseuse insisted in engaging in constant conversation with my gf. Masseuse spoke Chinese (but speaks English well enough to know what I'm saying), as does my gf (trilingual)\n\nAt first, I gave a look of annoyance to my gf, indicating I was looking for peace and quiet. 10m later, I said \"babe, the most relaxing bit of this is definitely you two chatting loudly\". Slightly passive aggressive, I admit, but I was clearly annoyed and was trying to avoid confrontation. Gf gave me a snarky reply but I thought the point was made.\n\nThird time around, still loads of noise and I let out a loud sigh of annoyance. By this point, gf has stopped responding but masseuse still chatting away. Fourth time, I say \"babe, please\".\n\nQuiet reigns for 10 or so minutes but then it reverts to normal. Fifth time rolls around and I've lost my patience. I snap and say to the masseuse \"if you two want to disturb something that just wants hibernate, can you please both fuck off to the zoo?\". \n\nThis did not go well.\n\nEverything went awkwardly quiet until the end of the massage but gf went apeshit after we left. Said I was rude, masseuse was just happy someone she massaged was Chinese, etc\n\nMy argument was that I booked this to relax and de-stress and it was ruined by this constant chatting (in Chinese, a language I don't speak) and I gave 5 clear signals that I wasn't happy. \n\nShe was still mad when we got home. I may be the AH for overreacting but this was my reward for myself and I brought gf along who, in my opinion, contributed to it being ruined.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n\n\nEDIT (on request): we've been to couples massages dozens of times. The base expectation on all of them is that we both chill and it's silent, bar the odd \"are you ok\" if someone makes a noise in pain. Gf had openly talked about how she was looking forward to me being able to relax post meeting and that I deserve the massage after all the stress and work. She's also got annoyed at me before for having a conversation with my massage therapist (when there was no work stress context)\n\nEDIT 2: I live in Asia. The word \"masseuse\" doesn't have any negative connotations here so please don't take that phrase as derogatory. Never heard phrases like LMT or massage therapist before. That's only used in a sports physio context where I am. No offence meant.\n\nEDIT 3: The zoo comment was referring to me. The bear who wants to hibernate. Plus, Singapore zoo is about 150m from where we were. It wasn't racist or aimed at anyone in that context.\n\nEDIT 4: After the comments, accept that I was totally OTT and should have said outright. Also took on board the comments around the nonverbal comms, particularly with the advice from those married for decades, and expecting her to know what I meant. Apologised to gf and addressed that specific point about how I should have said it directly rather than a glance. She told me that she knew what the first look meant, she confirmed it wasn't an aggressive look or anything and that she'd told masseuse that we'd prefer quiet and the masseuse ignored her. That doesn't justify the subsequent escalation ofc but wanted to clarify that she understood and had said something as a lot of the comments are focusing on that point.", "created_utc": 1669736589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7xhpn/aita_for_losing_my_temper_at_a_massage/", "score": 4323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As an American, I\u2019ve travelled overseas and was shocked that I could point out American men by how they carried themselves.", "The one caveat to this is that they live in Asia. I\u2019ve noticed that outside the US, culturally speaking, people do use sounds and not just words to communicate. In fact, most of the world doesn\u2019t even use sounds much of the time / they use gestures. \n\nNot using words is not, on its own, a sign of an AH in many parts of the world. Even to convey displeasure. \n\nSo the fact that he did so in this instance is to me not the reason that he\u2019s the AH. \n\nHe\u2019s an AH because it\u2019s not all about him, and his gf had a right to enjoy herself and if that means talking, then she\u2019s got every right. \n\nNo one needs to tiptoe around his a$$ all day \n\nYTA", "Massage Therapist here! I\u2019ve done hundreds of couples massages and I find that couples tend to fall into a few different categories.\nThe first kind are new to massage and don\u2019t want to go alone because they don\u2019t know what to expect. Understandable.\nThe second kind use it as like a date. They think it\u2019s romantic to get a massage together. They flirt or whatever while they\u2019re getting on the tables and giggle afterwards while we\u2019re waiting for them to get dressed. \nThe third are when one person (usually the wife/gf) dragged her husband/bf along and he clearly doesn\u2019t want to be there. She is usually trying to get him into it so it can become a regular thing for them to do together, or for them to do alone separately but he\u2019d never go alone the first time. \nThe fourth, least common , are couples where one is very controlling and doesn\u2019t want the other \u201cgetting all rubbed on by some stranger\u201d without them present. That person usually spends the entire service looking over at their partner, making sure nothing \u201ctoo sexy\u201d is going on. Those are actual quotes from real clients. \nThen there\u2019s the couples that come in together, book separate massages in private rooms and meet back up after. Those seem to enjoy it the most. \nCouples massages as a whole seem to be less beneficial than solo sessions. The therapist can focus more on the individual client, and not have to think about all the other things that go into creating a couples session (most importantly, navigating spatial issues with another therapist. It\u2019s hard doing synchronized massage.) Solo clients also get a much more tailored experience, with sounds and scents and temperatures to their liking without taking their partner into account. \nThese are my own personal experiences and observations.", "I'm Asian also, I get it. But you're still acting like that stereotypical Asian dad who has the \"Do as I say, not as I do\" mentality. You were basically telling these women: \"Be seen, not heard\". It's disrespectful. \n\nYou're stressed, that's valid. But if you have certain expectations, it's important to speak up about them upfront. \"I'm super stressed and need some dead silence for the next 2 hours, I'd appreciate little to no conversation. Thank you.\" And you're not giving your gf a treat if you're gonna behave that way. Next time go alone.", "IDK why I found that phrase so hilarious.", "I think it\u2019s different with a solo massage than a couple\u2019s massage. A couple\u2019s massage is intended somewhat as a joint experience for the two people receiving the massage, so the masseuse shouldn\u2019t be trying to engage with their client in a way that pushes aside the joint experience aspects.
