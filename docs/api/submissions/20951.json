I know this isn\u2019t a sub for debates about politics and honestly I\u2019m already exhausted enough with online discourse. I\u2019m here to get feedback on my conflict with my friend, nothing else. Don\u2019t try to debate me. \n\nDisclaimer aside, I (27f) have been friends with Penny (27f) for a long time. We met in middle school and have been thick as thieves ever since. In college, we gathered a fairly large mixed gender group of friends, including my boyfriend Max (26m). Penny started dating her boyfriend Chase (28m) a few months ago. \n\nRecently, Max and I had our friend group (including Chase) over to our apartment for a movie night. One of the movies we watched was Titanic, and Max was crying a little by the end. A few others were crying as well, but Max was the only male who was crying. Chase cracked a \u201cjoke\u201d about my boyfriend, something along the lines of \u201cHey Rose, need a tampon for that bleeding heart?\u201d The whole room went dead silent, only Penny and Chase laughed. I was in disbelief, that\u2019s the kind of joke I would expect from my fifty year old misogynistic uncle, not my best friend\u2019s boyfriend. (The following is paraphrased, I have a terrible memory lol.)\n\nI said, \u201cThat\u2019s not funny. Penny, you do know how misogynistic that is, right?\u201d\n\nPenny nervously laughed again and said \u201cRelax, it\u2019s just a joke, let\u2019s just get on with the next movie yeah?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cNo. Chase needs to own up to how awful that was. That kind of shit won\u2019t fly in my house.\u201d \n\nChase said \u201cWhat? No, it\u2019s just a joke. Can we please just get on with the next movie?\u201d \n\nMax then spoke up and said \u201cChase, she\u2019s right. That\u2019s a fucked up joke dude. Just apologize and we can forget this ever happened.\u201d \n\nWe went on for a few more rounds until I gave them the ultimatum that either Chase could apologize or they could both leave. Penny then said \u201cWould you chill the fuck out? It was a joke, is *Rose* so sensitive that he needs you to get into this pointless fight for him?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I told them \u201cBoth of you, get out now. God Penny, I can\u2019t believe you. You know, you\u2019re a terrible feminist if that\u2019s your response to your boyfriend being misogynistic.\u201d \n\nThen, both Penny and Chase left. \n\nLater, Penny texted me apologizing for Chase\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d but saying that what I did was \u201ctotally overboard\u201d and that it \u201cembarrassed Chase in front of our friend group.\u201d She also said that she was really upset about my \u201cterrible feminist\u201d comment and asked me how I could say that knowing how important feminism is to her. Now, both Penny and I are avid feminists. It\u2019s a subject near and dear to both of our hearts and one of the things we like to talk about, so I can maybe understand why it hurt her so much.

You\u2019re right, she is a terrible feminist.", "NTA. This is a prime example of how toxic masculinity hurts men as well as women. If Penny doesn\u2019t want to be called out she shouldn\u2019t support that shit.", "NTA. I thought maybe you were overreacting, but the moment she also called your boyfriend \"Rose,\" she was firmly as much of an AH as her boyfriend. Her apologizing was a decent start, but that she is more upset about having her cred questioned than correcting her boyfriend shows she isn't walking the walk.", "NTA. \u201cIt\u2019s only a joke\u201d - the standard fallback for bullies and abusers everywhere when they are called on their behavior and they want to turn the blame around into the people they hurt.\n\nLet\u2019s face it - Chase made fun of Max because it gave him a sense of power, and then panicked and doubled down when it fell flat. And Penny, for whatever reason, felt like she had to back the bad behavior (probably because Chase has her under his thumb and she would have caught all sorts of hell later I\u2019d she didn\u2019t). \n\nChase *needed* to be embarrassed in front of all your friends in order to learn that that behavior isn\u2019t acceptable. You did good!", "NTA she is a terrible feminist.  Those kind of \u201cjokes\u201d are not okay and Penny should have also been shutting that down.", "NTA\n\nUnless we \"overreact\" people will keep perpetuating toxic masculinity through tasteless jokes.", "NTA - it\u2019s your house. He could have just apologized if he wanted to get on with the night.", "NTA\n\nBoth Penny and Chase had a dig at your boyfriend for showing emotions in a manner that demonstrates that demonstrates gender prejudice and misogyny.\n\nGood for you for calling them out and backing Max.\n\nAnd now Chase is embarrassed when he started the whole thing by attempting to embarrass Max.", "NTA. Being a feminist who dates misogynistic men is peak terrible feminism.", "NTA, its not like you didn't give them a chance to walk it back and move on.", "NTA. She IS a terrible feminist. I would be starting to wonder if her feminism she wears when it suits her.", "I truly don\u2019t get how people keep doubling down on a joke that misses badly and bothers someone. As someone with an often truly dark sense of humor, I\u2019m extra sensitive on where and when to let it out and if I make a misstep on that, I apologize immediately. It\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s being a grown up. I get that your friend felt defensive being both in the position to guard her new-addition boyfriend from being ostracized while publicly being shamed (and that\u2019s your mid-step here, these convos go much better when taken aside, people tend to be more reasonable). But yea, it was a really dumb joke in poor taste that goes categorically against what she claims to believe\u2026I might have thought - if not (again publicly) - stated the same.", "NTA. \"just a joke\" isn't a get out of jail free card, nor is it even a logical excuse.", "NTA - your partner asked for an apology, and they declined and persisted. \n\nMaybe Penny needs to hear she's a bad feminist. That's not to say she's a bad person. It's to say it's an aspect of her belief system she needs to analyze more closely. She can educate her partner or admit her ideology isn't really that important to her, and it's more of a cosplay.", "NTA- what he said offended you and max.. and the he refused to apologize. So basically he chose his own ego over staying in the house. As for penny, I suspect she was trying to stand by her partner, she probably knew it was bad but had to choose who to side with, unfortunately she chose wrong, I don\u2019t think that one incident makes her a \u201cterrible feminist\u201d so saying that was kind of harsh. But kicking them out was much deserved.", "NTA - chase embarrassed himself by being a fucking dick. I\u2019m glad you kicked them out. I have a feeling that penny got like this soon after she started dating chase", "NTA all they had to do was apologize. The only one who embarrassed chase is chase. And your bad feminist comment is justified. Feminism isn\u2019t just defending women, it\u2019s equality for all genders.", "It's hard to stand up to friends and you did a great job. Penny probably did feel awkward and embarrassed about Chase's remarks, but presumably decided that defending him was more important than joining the criticism of him. Women who are feminists encounter this a lot, we recognise that the men we date might be newer to the ideas we hold dear, and we know it's a journey, so we try to educate them and make excuses for them in the meantime that we'd never make for ourselves. Chase's joke isn't Penny's fault, her reluctance to explain it all to him right there is understandable, and you were right to ask them both to leave.\n\nCalling Penny a terrible feminist does require an apology if you're going to continue your \"thick as thieves\" friendship, just as Penny owes you an apology not for Chase's joke but for trying to minimise the misogyny and harm jokes like that do. Hopefully the two of you can recover from this, and hopefully Chase gets better or gets out of your lives.", "The joke was indeed terrible, but only you know if it was worth probably ending your friendships with them over. I personally probably would have just told them to \u201cshut the f up\u201d and then let it go.", "NTA. I would be in shock if one of my friends said that! I think your response was justified bc the \u201cjoke\u201d was a disgusting thing to say! You\u2019re always going to ruffle some feathers when you actually stand up for what you believe. Talking about it is one thing, but you actually LIVED your truth. Bravo OP!", "NTA - Perhaps you did overreact a bit. Maybe a little more than a bit. But it seems as if all the other guests were stunned by the comment except Penny and Chase. However, the fact that Chase NEVER apologized puts him in true AH class. That leads me to believe that you are correct in your assessment of him as a misogynist. Penny will probably need a shoulder to cry on in the coming months.", "NTA that's not an ok thing to do and im glad you did not put up with it.", "NTA. Chase sounds like a whiney puss who isn't capable of manning up and apologizing for being a dick.", "ESH. Him for saying it, her for just trying to brush it off, and you for way over reacting", "ESH. It was a bad joke but it's not that big of a deal.", "Edit: sorry, misread the title. NTA for kicking Chase and Penny out, it's your place so you choose who you get to have in it. \n\nHowever, Y-T-A for overreacting to the joke. The joke was off yes, just call it out as such and explain why from your POV. Could've been a learning experience for Chase. Instead you immediately called out Penny, who didn't even crack the joke. They then both felt attacked and the situation went south.\n\nYou sound exhausting. Did you guys plan to have a discussion on feminism in Titanic after the film, too?", "What I don't understand is why does anyone watch that horrible movie to begin with?", "YTA.\n\nIt was a small joke. Not particularly funny, but nothing more than banter between men, and to be honest I would say it was very tame. \n\nNot every disagreement in life needs to be an argument. You can just listen, note, and then not invite back. Throwing them out just means they will go home wondering why when they put the politics in they take out the fun.\n\nYou should reconsider how you overreacted in this situation for future situations; it sounds like making and keeping friends is very hard for you. \n\nI imagine you are truly exhausting to be around.", "YTA. It was a joke. No one can laugh at themselves these days.", "ESH,\n\nTasteless joke, them for doubling down and not just apologizing and moving on. But you definitely overreacted. Most won\u2019t see it that way because everyone nowadays thinks in black and white.", "NAH, but you\u2019re no longer friends", "YTA. Seriously? Why does everyone have to be so sensitive these days? Don't you have better things to be offended by other than a bad joke? How about being offended by the economy or the homeless situation. Get over yourselves.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to be friends with her after this. I\u2019d love to know how she\u2019d react had it been a joke on a woman.", "NTA your friend isn't a feminist if she can keep calling your bf a female character's name for expressing emotion at a movie. That demeans women and men having emotions. Feminism 101. Which is garbage. Also, when the room points out your \"joke\" is outdated gender norms and not an actual joke. The adult thing to do is apologize and move on. Not triple down for my misogynistic views. Your house, you decide the people welcome in it.", "Penny a joke is when everyone is laughing. you and your misogynistic boy friend were the only ones laughing.\n\nThe boyfriend was bullying and penny laughed cause she probably agrees with it, or the dick is hella bomb idk. NTA", "NTA I'm the kind of person who thinks nothing is off limits to joke about, but this wasn't even a joke this was just straight up bullying someone he doesn't really know that well using some boomer macho misogynistic bs. It's like something the caricature of an out of touch redneck misogynist would say.", "NTA, Chase embarrassed himself by being misogynistic. Good on you and Max for calling him out.", "NTA.\n\n\"It's just a joke\" is the fall back of bullies and the emotionally stunted everywhere.\n\nAlso, the heart pumps out around 5 litres of blood a minute, and tampons, even the super xl size can only hold about 12 millilitres so a tampon is a terrible, terrible choice to stop a bleeding heart.", "NTA NTA NTAAAAAA. We need more women and men like you and your boyfriend. We need to establish these boundaries and CALL OUT this disgusting behavior. Thank you for doing so and don\u2019t ever stop. You\u2019re a gem and so is your boyfriend.", "YTA", "NTA. The reaction was probably a bit intense, but when Chase was given an opportunity to apologize and instead doubled down, all bets are off.\n\nBut calling your friend a \"terrible feminist\" was unfair. You're pinning his behavior on her.", "NTA. Penny's boyfriend will later turn out to be the kind of father who will have zero emotional capacity to tell his children he loves them and later give them behavioural issues", "NTA chase is just continuing with toxic masculinity he was probably brought up around", "NTA. If the shoe fits...\n\nAs for kicking her out, you didn't just kick her out for her misogyny, you also kicked her out for disrespecting your partner in your own home. That's perfectly reasonable grounds for making someone leave. They're just butthurt you had the guts to call them out on their actions and follow through.", "I can't believe someone would call themselves a feminist while thinking these kind of \"jokes\" are acceptable.", "I think it\u2019s really important for Penny to understand that identifying as feminist doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re immune to misogyny. I consider myself a very dedicated feminist, and part of that is having those difficult conversations with myself and critically examining thoughts and behaviors I\u2019ve had over the years (and honestly sometimes still today). \n\nYou can\u2019t be a sincere part of any major cultural shift if you\u2019re not willing to check yourself or accept when you\u2019re checked. That\u2019s true of feminism, anti-racism, anti-homophobia, and so on. It\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow when you stumble, but taking it is the only way you grow to be a better example of the ideology you believe in.", "If it is \"only a joke\" then simply apologize!!!!\n\nWhy drag this out??  Because it was a power play that fell flat.", "I think it\u2019s mostly that when someone gets called out or confronted they get their backs up and automatically try to defend themselves. That\u2019s why I always try to have private discussions with people if I feel like they\u2019re out of line. It gives them time to process what you have to say as well as a safe space to admit they fucked up.", "OP's saying that by comparing Max to a women as an insult that he was indirectly saying women are weak.\n\nWhile that's totally true I kind of think the primary target of the joke here was Max expressing his emotions, not women as a group being associated with weakness. (Although that's definitely a secondary point)", "I guess I'm too old or something,  but I agree...it was a stupid, un-funny joke. I would have called the dude out and moved on after 5 seconds.", "can you clarify the punchline?", "Because it wasn\u2019t targeting them.", ">identifying as feminist doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re immune to misogyny\n\nI'd argue this is more a case of misandry than misogyny tbh. Since it was a man that was targeted and it's more of an attack on Max's masculinity rather than femininity as a whole since Chase didn't mock the women that cried", "Excellent comment", "My mom has dated so many conservatives yet goes around saying she\u2019s a liberal", "Yeah I\u2019m definitely a \u201cif you do it in public ima call you out in public\u201d kinda person because why do you deserve privacy after mocking me publicly?", "Thank you so much for explaining. That makes a lot more sense.", "You are over the top. Wow.", "[removed]", "He was calling him feminine for crying. There\u2019s nothing wrong with men crying. It\u2019s not strictly a feminine trait. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a harmless joke.", "It's misogyny used to mock a man in a way that props up toxic masculinity. The joke is that Max is emotionally sensitive, which is \"weak and shameful\" (toxic masculinity) and it's so bad, he might need a tampon to fix it (a hygiene item normally viewed with disgust because it's used in conjunctions with periods. Because having periods is also gross and shameful) and thus he should be doubly ashamed for needing something designated for women.\n\nMisandry would be if they had made a joke out of how all men were awful, but that isn't the case here, it was just Max in particular being mocked for not upholding bullshit machismo ideas and then compared to being a woman as a punishment. Thus, toxic masculinity as a motivator and misogyny as a tool.\n\nRemember kids, misogyny (and misandry) hurts all genders!", "The \"joke\" (insult) was that he wasn't acting like a ManTM, but like a woman, and acting like a woman for a man is degrading because being a woman *is* degrading.\n\nIt's toxic masculinity - something our grandfathers in the 50s would say. The target is the man, but the insult is \"like a woman\".", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
