I know this isn\u2019t a sub for debates about politics and honestly I\u2019m already exhausted enough with online discourse. I\u2019m here to get feedback on my conflict with my friend, nothing else. Don\u2019t try to debate me. \n\nDisclaimer aside, I (27f) have been friends with Penny (27f) for a long time. We met in middle school and have been thick as thieves ever since. In college, we gathered a fairly large mixed gender group of friends, including my boyfriend Max (26m). Penny started dating her boyfriend Chase (28m) a few months ago. \n\nRecently, Max and I had our friend group (including Chase) over to our apartment for a movie night. One of the movies we watched was Titanic, and Max was crying a little by the end. A few others were crying as well, but Max was the only male who was crying. Chase cracked a \u201cjoke\u201d about my boyfriend, something along the lines of \u201cHey Rose, need a tampon for that bleeding heart?\u201d The whole room went dead silent, only Penny and Chase laughed. I was in disbelief, that\u2019s the kind of joke I would expect from my fifty year old misogynistic uncle, not my best friend\u2019s boyfriend. (The following is paraphrased, I have a terrible memory lol.)\n\nI said, \u201cThat\u2019s not funny. Penny, you do know how misogynistic that is, right?\u201d\n\nPenny nervously laughed again and said \u201cRelax, it\u2019s just a joke, let\u2019s just get on with the next movie yeah?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cNo. Chase needs to own up to how awful that was. That kind of shit won\u2019t fly in my house.\u201d \n\nChase said \u201cWhat? No, it\u2019s just a joke. Can we please just get on with the next movie?\u201d \n\nMax then spoke up and said \u201cChase, she\u2019s right. That\u2019s a fucked up joke dude. Just apologize and we can forget this ever happened.\u201d \n\nWe went on for a few more rounds until I gave them the ultimatum that either Chase could apologize or they could both leave. Penny then said \u201cWould you chill the fuck out? It was a joke, is *Rose* so sensitive that he needs you to get into this pointless fight for him?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I told them \u201cBoth of you, get out now. God Penny, I can\u2019t believe you. You know, you\u2019re a terrible feminist if that\u2019s your response to your boyfriend being misogynistic.\u201d \n\nThen, both Penny and Chase left. \n\nLater, Penny texted me apologizing for Chase\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d but saying that what I did was \u201ctotally overboard\u201d and that it \u201cembarrassed Chase in front of our friend group.\u201d She also said that she was really upset about my \u201cterrible feminist\u201d comment and asked me how I could say that knowing how important feminism is to her. Now, both Penny and I are avid feminists. It\u2019s a subject near and dear to both of our hearts and one of the things we like to talk about, so I can maybe understand why it hurt her so much. I\u2019m also getting flak from other (mostly male) folks in our friend group who also say I overreacted, but they\u2019re in the minority.

You and Max have every right to kick anyone out for any reason if you both agree. Also, it seems like Penny is more concerned about her and her boyfriend\u2019s image than actually upholding feminist principles or fighting misogyny. You\u2019re right, she is a terrible feminist.", "NTA. This is a prime example of how toxic masculinity hurts men as well as women. If Penny doesn\u2019t want to be called out she shouldn\u2019t support that shit.", "NTA. I thought maybe you were overreacting, but the moment she also called your boyfriend \"Rose,\" she was firmly as much of an AH as her boyfriend. Her apologizing was a decent start, but that she is more upset about having her cred questioned than correcting her boyfriend shows she isn't walking the walk.", "NTA. \u201cIt\u2019s only a joke\u201d - the standard fallback for bullies and abusers everywhere when they are called on their behavior and they want to turn the blame around into the people they hurt.\n\nLet\u2019s face it - Chase made fun of Max because it gave him a sense of power, and then panicked and doubled down when it fell flat. And Penny, for whatever reason, felt like she had to back the bad behavior (probably because Chase has her under his thumb and she would have caught all sorts of hell later I\u2019d she didn\u2019t). \n\nChase *needed* to be embarrassed in front of all your friends in order to learn that that behavior isn\u2019t acceptable. You did good!", "NTA she is a terrible feminist.  Those kind of \u201cjokes\u201d are not okay and Penny should have also been shutting that down.", "NTA\n\nUnless we \"overreact\" people will keep perpetuating toxic masculinity through tasteless jokes.", "NTA - it\u2019s your house. He could have just apologized if he wanted to get on with the night.", "NTA\n\nBoth Penny and Chase had a dig at your boyfriend for showing emotions in a manner that demonstrates that demonstrates gender prejudice and misogyny.\n\nGood for you for calling them out and backing Max.\n\nAnd now Chase is embarrassed when he started the whole thing by attempting to embarrass Max.", "NTA. Being a feminist who dates misogynistic men is peak terrible feminism.", "NTA, its not like you didn't give them a chance to walk it back and move on.", "NTA. She IS a terrible feminist. I would be starting to wonder if her feminism she wears when it suits her.", "I truly don\u2019t get how people keep doubling down on a joke that misses badly and bothers someone. As someone with an often truly dark sense of humor, I\u2019m extra sensitive on where and when to let it out and if I make a misstep on that, I apologize immediately. It\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s being a grown up. I get that your friend felt defensive being both in the position to guard her new-addition boyfriend from being ostracized while publicly being shamed (and that\u2019s your mid-step here, these convos go much better when taken aside, people tend to be more reasonable). But yea, it was a really dumb joke in poor taste that goes categorically against what she claims to believe\u2026I might have thought - if not (again publicly) - stated the same.", "NTA. \"just a joke\" isn't a get out of jail free card, nor is it even a logical excuse.", "NTA - your partner asked for an apology, and they declined and persisted. \n\nMaybe Penny needs to hear she's a bad feminist. That's not to say she's a bad person. It's to say it's an aspect of her belief system she needs to analyze more closely. She can educate her partner or admit her ideology isn't really that important to her, and it's more of a cosplay.", "NTA- what he said offended you and max.. and the he refused to apologize. So basically he chose his own ego over staying in the house. As for penny, I suspect she was trying to stand by her partner, she probably knew it was bad but had to choose who to side with, unfortunately she chose wrong, I don\u2019t think that one incident makes her a \u201cterrible feminist\u201d so saying that was kind of harsh. But kicking them out was much deserved.", "NTA - chase embarrassed himself by being a fucking dick. I\u2019m glad you kicked them out. I have a feeling that penny got like this soon after she started dating chase", "NTA all they had to do was apologize. The only one who embarrassed chase is chase. And your bad feminist comment is justified. Feminism isn\u2019t just defending women, it\u2019s equality for all genders.", "It's hard to stand up to friends and you did a great job. Penny probably did feel awkward and embarrassed about Chase's remarks, but presumably decided that defending him was more important than joining the criticism of him. Women who are feminists encounter this a lot, we recognise that the men we date might be newer to the ideas we hold dear, and we know it's a journey, so we try to educate them and make excuses for them in the meantime that we'd never make for ourselves. Chase's joke isn't Penny's fault, her reluctance to explain it all to him right there is understandable, and you were right to ask them both to leave.\n\nCalling Penny a terrible feminist does require an apology if you're going to continue your \"thick as thieves\" friendship, just as Penny owes you an apology not for Chase's joke but for trying to minimise the misogyny and harm jokes like that do. Hopefully the two of you can recover from this, and hopefully Chase gets better or gets out of your lives.", "The joke was indeed terrible, but only you know if it was worth probably ending your friendships with them over. I personally probably would have just told them to \u201cshut the f up\u201d and then let it go.", "NTA. I would be in shock if one of my friends said that! I think your response was justified bc the \u201cjoke\u201d was a disgusting thing to say! You\u2019re always going to ruffle some feathers when you actually stand up for what you believe. Talking about it is one thing, but you actually LIVED your truth. Bravo OP!", "NTA - Perhaps you did overreact a bit. Maybe a little more than a bit. But it seems as if all the other guests were stunned by the comment except Penny and Chase. However, the fact that Chase NEVER apologized puts him in true AH class. That leads me to believe that you are correct in your assessment of him as a misogynist. Penny will probably need a shoulder to cry on in the coming months.", "NTA that's not an ok thing to do and im glad you did not put up with it.", "NTA. Chase sounds like a whiney puss who isn't capable of manning up and apologizing for being a dick.", "ESH. Him for saying it, her for just trying to brush it off, and you for way over reacting", "ESH. It was a bad joke but it's not that big of a deal.", "Edit: sorry, misread the title. NTA for kicking Chase and Penny out, it's your place so you choose who you get to have in it. \n\nHowever, Y-T-A for overreacting to the joke. The joke was off yes, just call it out as such and explain why from your POV. Could've been a learning experience for Chase. Instead you immediately called out Penny, who didn't even crack the joke. They then both felt attacked and the situation went south.\n\nYou sound exhausting. Did you guys plan to have a discussion on feminism in Titanic after the film, too?", "What I don't understand is why does anyone watch that horrible movie to begin with?", "YTA.\n\nIt was a small joke. Not particularly funny, but nothing more than banter between men, and to be honest I would say it was very tame. \n\nNot every disagreement in life needs to be an argument. You can just listen, note, and then not invite back. Throwing them out just means they will go home wondering why when they put the politics in they take out the fun.\n\nYou should reconsider how you overreacted in this situation for future situations; it sounds like making and keeping friends is very hard for you. \n\nI imagine you are truly exhausting to be around.", "YTA. It was a joke. No one can laugh at themselves these days.", "ESH,\n\nTasteless joke, them for doubling down and not just apologizing and moving on. But you definitely overreacted. Most won\u2019t see it that way because everyone nowadays thinks in black and white.", "NAH, but you\u2019re no longer friends", "YTA. Seriously? Why does everyone have to be so sensitive these days? Don't you have better things to be offended by other than a bad joke? How about being offended by the economy or the homeless situation. Get over yourselves.", "NTA.

Instead, they have to insist they were in the right, that your feelings don't matter, and that it's okay to be a dick when it's 'just a joke'. I don't know what it is about this society that's made apologizing feel like a four letter word to some people.", "NTA. you didn\u2019t overreact.

They chose to leave.", "NTA", "NTA!\n\nIt's outdated to make fun of men crying! You were right to defend max and then she added fuel to the fire. You are right it's sexist.

It was misogynistic because he used femininity as an insult, and perpetuated patriarchy because he insulted my boyfriend for showing emotions. The social role of men as stoic workers is one of the main tools of patriarchy.", "I found Chase.", "\u2026 because we weren\u2019t talking about the economy or homelessness?

When you're down you lash out and say things to try to cause maximum impact - calling Max \"Rose\" was what got OP angry in the first place, Penny was playing that up.

As she said, that \u2018joke\u2019 was so unexpected, especially from the boyfriend of her feminist best friend. I also think OP took Penny\u2019s initial laugh as an endorsement of Chase\u2019s \u2018joke\u2019.

It was the fact that he couldn\u2019t own up to it that ticked me off.", "Yes, my read is that OP's reaction was to question Penny instead of Chase. There's no reason to do this, it was unfair of OP to attribute Chase's behaviour to Penny - Chase is an adult, not Penny's child. I really think this whole thing would've gone differently if OP didn't start in attack mode. The laughing was more a symptom of Penny and Chase's new relationship - these things are tricky to navigate. She doesn't sound like she has a lot of relationship experience.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's up to OP if she wants to be friends with Penny; they have a history together so assumedly OP would know how Penny has behaved previously and if this is out of character or a trend.", "It's sad to think that a person has to be a fully formed, perfect version of themselves by 27.", "All I'm saying is save the outrage for stuff that matters and not a joke amongst friends. And go make Max a sandwich. Relax. I'm just messing with you.", "Again, it wasn\u2019t a joke among friends because Chase isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s friend.
