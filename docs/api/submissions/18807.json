This was a risqu\u00e9 joke gift, and your friend needs to learn the most important lesson about risqu\u00e9 humour: Know your audience.", "NTA. Your friend spent money on a gift they knew you didn\u2019t want, in order to embarrass you- in public. Frankly they should be glad you simply threw it in the trash rather than directly at them. This was an incredibly immature thing for them to do and if they want to waste their money on immature, humiliating gifts, then they have to accept the consequences of their actions. They don\u2019t sound like friends worth keeping, frankly.", "NTA - the gift was inappropriate.  Even if meant as a joke, it's something you should only give someone you know VERY VERY well and know for certain will appreciate the joke.  Telling you to wait to open it while everyone was eating was both inappropriate and weird.  Let him fish it out of the trash and keep it for himself.", "A: what sort of moron spends that much money on a joke?\n\nB: what sort of moron thinks that sort of \"joke\" is funny?

If someone hits you with a pie in the face as a joke, you don't keep it on your face for the rest of your life. You clean it off and throw it away. \n\nAnd not for nothing, but didn't you make a post about losing your sex drive and how your gf was annoyed by it? That sounds like she's been talking to your friend, and your friend decided to \"help\" you out. As a result, I would wonder about your gf talking about private matters.", "NTA. \nTell him that he's absolutely free to get it out of the trash can and use it for himself so he won't regret the 50 bucks he lost.", "NTA - he bought it for a joke, the joke was made.

Was he upset you didn't keep it and shove it up your ass? Was he mad that you didn't give it back if you didn't want it so he could? Like setting aside that your friend is an asshole, and he is, a gift is a gift whether it's a gag or not.\n\nIf he didn't want to be out 50\u20ac for a dildo he shouldn't have bought you a 50\u20ac dildo.", "NTA. You were given a gift specifically to embarrass you. You reacted in anger. Aren't you the bad sport! \u2014 sarcasm. \n\nYour friend was doing it to deliberately be mean to you.

How many times would you have to use it in order for him to feel like he got his money's worth out of it?  And are you supposed to let him know when you've reached that milestone so that he can feel good about 'money well spent'?  Or was he expecting to watch?  \n\n\nBecause- EW!!!!

I always carefully select the books I buy for her. They are very meaningful gifts. She reads them once and, then, she gives them away - to my cousin, to a friend of hers, to a charitable organization. And I don't care. Because, once I've given it to her, it's hers to do as she pleases with.\n\nWhy am I boring you with this incursion in my private life? To explain why I think your friend is being a massive tool. He bought you a gag gift and got exactly the reaction he wanted to have. What more does he want? If he's mad about the money he \"lost\" because you threw it away, then he shouldn't have spent as much. Was he hoping to bring it back to the shop and recoup that money afterwards? That's not how gifts work.\n\nAnd, honestly, unless you thought it was a good joke (and it doesn't sound like you did), you're the one who should be mad. He could have given you something thoughtful. He could have given you something meaningless. He could have bought you a drink and called that your birthday present. He could have given you nothing at all. Instead, he bought you something he knew (if he knows you at all) would embarass you.\n\nNow, I understand that friends get to rag on each other. Obviously. But you also know how to pick your moment. You're supposed to take the mick because you care, not to make the other person feel stupid.\n\nSo I hope this is a really good friend of yours on literally every other occasion, otherwise it sounds like you have a tough decision ahead of you.

Burn! I like your pettiness \ud83d\ude01", "Let this commenter use it on himself, I guess", "What do you do with a dildo if you do not want to use it bc you're simply not into that, you find the type, shape, material, size not suitable or even disgusting? I mean even if you use toys in general to select a toy that suits you and your partner is a very personal thing. Normal people don't mess with that. \n\nSo appart from being obviously appalled what do you do with it when you obviously don't want it yourselves? Donate it? And if so to whom? I mean it's obviously an embarrasing gift and OP can not just give it to somebody else without risking to embarras this person. \n\nOr you mean take it home to get mocked everytime OP meets his \"friends\"? Well I can figure the comments. Say OP did you try your present? Did your girl like it? Does she like it better than yours. I mean that was the whole purpose of the gift that \"friends\" can ask idiotic questions like that. \n\nTo throw it away ruined the \"fun\" for the alleged friend. Jokes won't work bc OP got rid of it for everybody to see and to make it clear it won't be used. With that OP protected themselves. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. That'll teach \"friend\" to spend money more wisely."]}
