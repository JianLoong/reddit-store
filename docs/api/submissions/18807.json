He bought you a gag gift and got exactly the reaction he wanted to have. What more does he want? If he's mad about the money he \"lost\" because you threw it away, then he shouldn't have spent as much. Was he hoping to bring it back to the shop and recoup that money afterwards? That's not how gifts work.\n\nAnd, honestly, unless you thought it was a good joke (and it doesn't sound like you did), you're the one who should be mad. He could have given you something thoughtful. He could have given you something meaningless. He could have bought you a drink and called that your birthday present. He could have given you nothing at all. Instead, he bought you something he knew (if he knows you at all) would embarass you.\n\nNow, I understand that friends get to rag on each other. Obviously. But you also know how to pick your moment.
