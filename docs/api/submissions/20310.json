Neither you nor your mom should be paying for him to retake his exams. People deserve a break sometimes- he has been given the opportunity to do the work again, THAT was his break. Bailing people out of every single problem that they ever have creates people who feel entitled to being bailed out of every problem. Let him learn what accountability is. \n\nYOU are a college student and you need your money to live. He doesn\u2019t NEED it. He\u2019s not on the street, he isn\u2019t starving or hurt. He cheated on his exams.", "NTA..\n\nYour brother can earn himself and pay for his exams. What your mother is doing is enabling his bad behaviour. He will never face the consequences of his actions.

It\u2019s an important life lesson.", "NTA. I want to know if the fact that he cheated is because he thought he couldn\u2019t pass.

This isn't your problem to deal with. NTA.", "So he needs to retake 2 exams meaning he\u2019s only having to pay $300. Why doesn\u2019t he go mow a couple lawns? Walk a few dogs? Babysit a few kids? There is always opportunities for him to earn the money elsewhere but he\u2019s choosing not too and your mom is encouraging you to take his punishment.

Why should other people have to suffer for what he did?", "NTA. Do NOT pay. He isn't going to learn without feeling the burn himself.\n\nHe needs to ask for an extension, get a job if he hasn't got one, and work it off himself.\n\nIf it does come down to having to pay for him, asking for various high value items of his to hold hostage until he pays you back triple. Just to drive the point home.", "NTA He cheated and got caught, it\u2019s not your responsibility to try and save him.", "I'm honestly more worried about him cheating in the engineering exam and hoping to get away with it.", "No, just tell them that you don\u2019t have the money. (End of conversation, because you don\u2019t.).", "I mean, I couldn't agree more about the NTA, but I gotta ask -- he shouldn't have cheated because he couldn't afford the re-exam?  Is it okay for rich kids to cheat?\n\nI mean, I worked part-time to pay for my own degree (back when that was possible), so is my degree worth more than the rich kid's degree who just used his parents' money?  I kinda think it is, but employers have never brought that up.", "He\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t get kicked out, if that happened at my uni you wouldn\u2019t have a chance to retake it, you\u2019d just be gone.", "I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say. I meant that the younger brother knew the situation was so bleak, then shouldn't it be even more motivation to study for the exam rather than cheat?\n\nCheating is never okay, and their economic condition should've been an extra push in the right direction if anything.", "Yeah, I guess I'm kinda pissed off the course is structured so that a rich person could just pay to sit the exam again, perhaps without noticing the cost, and a poor person is totally screwed.  That's a crappy way to do things.\n\nShould OP have to pay for his brother's screwup?  Nope, right on.  NTA.\n\nShould his brother be unable to graduate because he can't afford what other students can?  No, that's ridiculous.  Should he be unable to graduate because he's a cheater, and bad one at that?  Well, that's a different question."]}
