To avoid a holiday routine with his own kid... over a sports game? NTA\n\nBut I would advise you, that your son will be a teen soon. And his dad doesnt sound like a good role model. Tread carefully Op. And good luck", "It sounds like his drinking caused an issue that led him to miss something he considered a major event and he's upset with you for not dragging his drunk ass downstairs? No. Even if alcohol wasn't a factor and he was just distracted when answering, NTA.", "And... The punch line. He had 4 glasses of wine, passed out/fell asleep so hard he can't remember the conversation? And now he's sulking? He's either being a petulant jerk or he's got an alcohol use issue. Run thru one of the checklists and see if anything else rings a bell. https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcoholism-treatment/assessment\n\nIf he's just sulking, treat him like a two year old having a tantrum.

Is your husband a child?", "NTA, he's a whole ass adult, he shouldn't need you to hold his widdle hand. He knew about putting things out for Santa and decided to go watch the game instead, and you still went to doublecheck if he wanted to come down and he said no. You did everything you could to make sure he didn't miss out and the reason he DID miss out is his fault, not yours. He needs to grow the hell up and stop sulking and pouting and throwing a tantrum like a toddler. He's a grown man, he needs to act like it.", "NTA\n\nYou asked, he said no?? On what planet can this be your fault? His behavior is ridiculous.", "NTA He didn't want to spend time watching movies with you and your son. He wanted to watch a game by himself. He clearly didn't want to be part. Now he's being overly dramatic.

Hubs is wrong and a big whiny baby. You are the reasonable adult here. and NTA", "NTA, that you are questioning your sanity, it sounds like his gaslighting is effective.\n\nHe is the one who's choosing to drink and spend his time alone watching TV separated from you and the children, and then getting angry at you to make a villain out of you for him not participating.  Either he's doing it entirely to put you in waiting mode forever, where you don't do anything with your kids unless you have direct permission from him, or because he's trying to save face and make you out to be the villain in this situation since your kids noticed.\n\nPlease read under the about section the resources for individuals in abusive situations. Cuz what you're talking about is abusive. Your husband choosing alcohol over the family, not spending time with you and the kids, and then punishing you and making you question your sanity is abuse", "Wow what a winner.

You wanna starve the reindeer?", "Carrots are for the reindeer.\n\nAt my house whenever there are kids here, Santa gets cookies and beer.", "I have the horrible problem with over sleeping, sometimes my wife could literally shake me and I wouldn't have any idea she had ever tried.

I can provide reasonably coherent answers while sleeping, and retain no memory of it afterwards.\n\nHusband has realized that I can't be held accountable for stuff I say when im mostly asleep- but is free to mock me for it. For my part, if I miss something important, I realize it's my own damn fault, and I laugh at myself.", "If OP's husband did that regularly or even occasionally, OP probably wouldn't feel like she's going crazy right now.", "OP knows that X happened (he was awake and said no), and he's trying to convince her that no, she's wrong, it was actually Y (he was asleep).  That is 100% gaslighting.  He is apparently having some success, since OP feels like she's going crazy.", "Fair", "That sounds reasonable, right?\n\nThat's the thing about gaslighting it messes w the victims' sense if reality & erodes it over time.\n\nThis also effects cognition.\n\nMore likely he does this in a million little ways. That's how we don't see it happening.\n\nMy measure was that my ex never tried to cut me off from friends or family. \n\nIf he had I would have seen that for the giant red flag it is.\n\nInstead he whittled me down and compressed everything about my world until I was in bed, on the floor or wishing I was dead.\n\nIt's insidious not obvious.", "I know what gaslighting is, there's a reason I don't trust myself to make that judgment"]}
