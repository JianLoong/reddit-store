Sounds like a gross, drunk dad who left you to handle everything on Christmas Eve.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

To avoid a holiday routine with his own kid... over a sports game? NTA\n\nBut I would advise you, that your son will be a teen soon. And his dad doesnt sound like a good role model. Tread carefully Op. And good luck", "It sounds like his drinking caused an issue that led him to miss something he considered a major event and he's upset with you for not dragging his drunk ass downstairs? No. Even if alcohol wasn't a factor and he was just distracted when answering, NTA.", "And... The punch line. He had 4 glasses of wine, passed out/fell asleep so hard he can't remember the conversation? And now he's sulking? He's either being a petulant jerk or he's got an alcohol use issue. Run thru one of the checklists and see if anything else rings a bell. https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcoholism-treatment/assessment\n\nIf he's just sulking, treat him like a two year old having a tantrum. Either way he just earmed a free pass to a marriage counselor.\n\nNTA", "NTA he was served the thing he ordered he said no so... No", "NTA. Is your husband a child?", "NTA, he's a whole ass adult, he shouldn't need you to hold his widdle hand. He knew about putting things out for Santa and decided to go watch the game instead, and you still went to doublecheck if he wanted to come down and he said no. You did everything you could to make sure he didn't miss out and the reason he DID miss out is his fault, not yours. He needs to grow the hell up and stop sulking and pouting and throwing a tantrum like a toddler. He's a grown man, he needs to act like it.", "NTA\n\nYou asked, he said no?? On what planet can this be your fault? His behavior is ridiculous.", "NTA He didn't want to spend time watching movies with you and your son. He wanted to watch a game by himself. He clearly didn't want to be part. Now he's being overly dramatic. Sorry OP but you have 2 children not one.", "NTA\n\nAw hubby sounds drunk frustrated.\n\nIf still mad later plan for something Cool next year.\n\nSanta's secret is only the beginning.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
