We all had 3 months to plan ahead. \n\nFor context, my friend's boyfriend and I have asthma. My asthma is so severe that I have disabled parking and an SDiT. I don't know how severe his is, but I feel it's relevant to add that he smokes weed, cigarettes, and vapes.\n\nAlmost every time we all hang out, he asks to use my inhalers and I give them to him without a second thought. \n\nBefore we left for the trip, I let my friend know that I didn't have the means to be sharing my inhalers with him. \n\nAs you've probably already guessed, he asked to use one of my inhalers on the last day of the trip. I gave him one of them to use and thought nothing of it until last night (3 weeks later). \n\nSo, my friend comes to me and says that as her friend, I could have at least given him a few puffs off my inhaler. \n\nI told her that she was coming across as selfish for being upset with me over the inhalers that I rely on and pay for, and I didn't understand how she had any place to be upset when I literally shared my inhaler when he asked. \n\nShe said that the inhaler that I shared with him wasn't my rescue inhaler and therefore didn't help him and she had to \"watch him suffer\" on the way home because of it. \n\nAsthma medicine shortage aside, I really just don't understand how I was wrong for being concerned about my health, too. I love her and we've been friends for a long time, but I just don't see how I was wrong for giving him one inhaler over the other when he didn't even bother to specify which one he wanted. \n\nSo...\nAm I the asshole for not giving him my rescue inhaler?\n\nEDIT** I really appreciate everyone's responses! Thank you, I feel a lot better about defending myself during this disagreement. \n\nA couple of things to add: \n\nI know it's not sanitary, I disinfect the inhalers every time they get used. \n\nI know you're not supposed to share prescriptions, it's just not easy to tell someone \"hey I know you can't breathe that great but I can't give you something that may or may not help you\"  \n\nThey've been together around 3 years and they have kids together. \n\nI made sure to establish that I will not be sharing my inhalers with him, or anyone else, ever again.", "created_utc": 1678557478, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oqgz7/aita_for_not_handing_over_my_rescue_inhaler/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You really don\u2019t want to have a \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d attitude about asthma. At the very least she should have an inhaler in her purse for him.", "NTA, as you seem to grasp (good for you, recognizing a problem is the first step in correcting it, now create a plan) you have a problem saying no and are taken advantage of as a result.  I have migraine issues and have been known to share medication to stop a migraine for another person who gets them when they are in the throws of a migraine attack as I can't watch a person in pain when I can't prevent it.  Similar circumstances different issues, I get a limited amount of the medication I use as it is controlled and so I will not do this for anyone though if they refuse to deal with their issues themselves.  This is because I am responsible for my health first and this could create a compromising situation for me.  If you need a reason to use that should be a 'go to' reason for you and leave it at that.\n\n  If you want other things to consider besides what others have said think about cold sores and other mouth related diseases  such as HPV and anything that can be exhaled back into the inhaled or rebound off the mouth from the shot of pressurized air.  Many of those kind of things are long lasting and only need fluid transfer to be spread and HPV can cause mouth, throat, tongue and other cancers and carriers aren't always noticable, same with herpes and other conditions.  Stick to your guns on this and work at saying no for your own sake and health.", "Your asthma requires disabled parking. His asthma allows him to smoke. You are not the same.\n\nNTA", "NTA and the last thing you want to do is to share an inhaler with someone who smokes weed among other things and doesn't look after himself. You pay for it, its what saves your life and its possibly prescribed for you. I am not even sure if he's allowed to use it or what reaction it might cause with him. With his poor quality lungs, if something were to go wrong, you might be criminally charged with the event for giving him something that was supposed to be for your sole use based on dosage strength etc. So there's nothing you need to feel bad about and maybe its time to put an end to this sharing practice. If he wants, he can pay for and bring his own or let him suffer as he doesn't sound like the ideal candidate for a lung transplant even if one were to become available. Sometimes a bit of suffering opens their eyes and they start taking better care of themselves or at times nature takes its toll. That's how life is and its not upto you to have to make up for other peoples negligence.", "NTA, how were you supposed to even know which inhaler to give him is he didn't even ask for the rescue inhaler. Are you supposed to read his mind and know exactly which inhaler he wants?", "NTA\n\nFirst: Its not your responsibility to provide his asthma drugs for him\n\nSecondly: When did his lack of preparation become your responsibility to finance? (and inhalers arent cheap!!)\n\nThirdly: If your friend is that concerned about her boyfriend, then she can go and buy him the asthma inhaler he 'needs'\n\nFourth: Unless he has a prescription from a doctor for a rescue inhaler, no one should be giving their inhaler to him (for safety reasons)\n\nLastly: If he is 'suffering' from asthma, then he needs to be carrying his own inhaler.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, you need to cut this \"friend\" out of your life, immediately.\n\n**She is more worried about her AH boyfriend \"suffering\" than about your very life.**\n\nDoctors don't issue prescriptions for rescue inhalers for funsies.  They do it because you could literally **die** if you have a bad asthma attack.\n\nShe may have been your friend for a long time, but **our actions always show our true values more than any words.**  Her actions scream \"I don't care if you could die from an asthma attack as long as my boyfriend is OK\"\n\nClearly her boyfriend's asthma is not serious enough for a doctor to prescribe him a rescue inhaler.  Or, he DGAF since he smokes and vapes which is the worst thing you can do with asthma.  It's not your job to keep her boyfriend from \"suffering\"\n\nDrop the AH friend and her equally AH boyfriend.  He's an AH for smoking and vaping, etc. while he has asthma --- and relying on other people to give him rescue inhalers.", "you're not responsible for somebody else's drugs\n\nnta", "NTA.  That is your rescue inhaler.  If he's in need of an inhaler, a cheap option would be to stop smoking and vaping and see if that maybe helps (shocker).  If your friend is so invested, maybe she can pay for him to see a doctor.", "NTA We\u2019re having a serious albuterol shortage right now.

I\u2019m not shaming him for using any of those things, but he needs to prioritize his health over his wants. Depending on how often he needs it, it may just be a matter of cutting back for a couple of weeks every few months or so, it doesn\u2019t seem like his is life threatening or they would have said something before three weeks passed and it would be more important to him to have his own rescue inhaler.", "NTA. But you need to put an immediate cold hard stop to sharing your inhalers with him at all, like ever. You\u2019re not his mommy.

Hard breathing, tight chest, incapacitating. I once had one of the attacks in a retail store and some well meaning someone gave me their asthma inhaler and told me how to use it. Me, never having used one before and in the middle of a panic attack, just did what she said. The medication ramped up my panic attack and I was literally vibrating from the steroid or whatever is in those things. Worst hour physically of my life before it subsided. Don't give people your meds. You don't know if they have a reaction to it and you don't need to be responsible for other adults medication.", "NTA.

Never share inhalers. It's like sharing a toothbrush. Gross and unhygienic. Also you are paying for these. Even with co-pays some types are still hella expensive.  Has he ever offered to pay you back? Didn't think so. Tell him no next time and to get his own. You are not his supplier", "Nta\n\nIf he smokes he doesn't *need* the inhaler, and if he actually did need one then he'd have one of his own.", "Nta. Yuck I have an inhaler and I'd never share it especially with someone that is basically causing their own damn issues", "Do you know for a fact that he has asthma, or are you taking his word for it?

First, you were more than nice to let him use the one. I wouldn't.  If he was having problems, he could have called his Dr office and had them send a prescription. I did that once in another state. It works\n\nSecond, rescue inhalers are for extreme reactions or if the first inhaler doesn't relieve your symptoms enough.  Been there, done that.\n\nYou are NTA, but she sure is.

If you don't have the money,  don't go.", "Sounds like his plan or an emergency is to have you around and then borrow. He needs to get his own.
