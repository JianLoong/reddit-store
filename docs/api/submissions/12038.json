Number 2, you understand you're not supposed to share prescriptions, so just don't. End of story. If your friend's boyfriend is having attacks regularly enough to need to ask to borrow your inhaler more than once ever, he needs to be carrying his with him.

If he needs the inhaler and doesn't have one, call 911. He needs to see his doctor, not just rely on you to be his caregiver and share your meds. Thirdly, your friend is right only in the fact that you didn't help him by giving him an inhaler that isn't your rescue inhaler. \n\nI'm curious if you actually understand the medication you're taking (and just handing even though you are not a trained medical professional with the authority to decide what medications a person should be taking and if they're safe). If the inhaler you shared with your friend's boyfriend was not a rescue inhaler, then it was a maintenance inhaler. Meaning it does absolutely no good during an attack and is only useful when taken regularly, as prescribed, long term. If you were going to share your prescription medication (which you should not have), why would you share one that doesn't do any good? You had to have known it wasn't helpful. And if you didn't know, that's even more proof that you shouldn't be sharing your goddamn medications, because you don't understand them! Honestly, sharing a medication that had no benefit to him was the worst option you had. And it's going to be more detrimental to you in the long run as well, because a rescue inhaler is as needed, but a maintenance inhaler is taken daily, so there's more room with the rescue inhaler to waste a dose or two. If you have insurance that you're using to pay for your medications, you are very likely not ever going through your rescue inhaler faster than the days supply insurance assumes for it. But your maintenance inhaler should be lasting you exactly the number of days insurance will have on record as the days supply. So you may now have an issue where you run out of your maintenance inhaler and insurance says it's too early for you to refill it, and you have to wait or pay out of pocket.\n\nAnyway, stop sharing your meds. No is a full sentence. And learn what your meds are used for and check with your doctor to make sure you're taking them properly. If you don't understand how your maintenance inhaler works and you're not taking it daily, that is certainly preventing you from getting the full benefits of the medication.", "NTA- It is not your responsibility to provide him prescription medications.
