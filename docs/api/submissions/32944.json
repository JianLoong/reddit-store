Our small wedding of 8 guests (excluding our parents) happened in my apartment living room, to save for a house in Europe. I made sure to keep my wedding a secret because I didn't want the stress of handling other peoples' reactions, since the usual wedding in my circle is extravagant and at the roof of a skyscraper, or high-end resort/hotel.\n\n*edit: weird sentence structure*\n\nI went to the same school from elementary to high school, and the moms of our batch made a friend group and still socializes to this day. I didn't really keep it hidden from my mom that I was bullied by a great chunk of the batch for most of my years there, so my mom understands how I would prefer to keep the wedding very small instead of being selective and hurting someone's ego. In school, the people who openly bullied me stopped when one of them stood up for me in middle school (we became best friends since and she attended my wedding. Two girls who transferred in after and didn't bully me also became my best friends and were invited to my wedding (I consider all three of them my maid of honor (MOH)).\n\nWe finally posted the wedding and lunch party to social media and my mom's group chat was filled with surprise. I was first in my batch to get married, and sadly, there were less of congratulations and more of angry people expressing betrayal because they weren't informed of, from as far as, my engagement. They expressed that it was congruent to their best friend getting married without getting invited nor informed at all. I felt confused by this, because these people were neither my best friend, nor were I best friends with their child in school. Nevertheless, I told my mom to use me as the excuse to dampen the fire, as I (the bride) wished for this secrecy and not my mom! They instead insisted that it shouldn't have mattered because a mother's decision triumph's a daughter's.\n\nAfter my mom's attempt to reassure them, they turned to painting me as the opportunist narcissist who only cares for herself since I didn't inform them of my wedding, and for using my MOHs for an extravagant wedding, which was far from the truth. A selective group of the parents (in my mom's friend group) started pitting fights between my MOHs and I by personally messaging the MOHs. When that didn't work they pitted my MOHs' moms to each other, which unfortunately somehow worked.\n\nMy mom being overwhelmed by all this blocked the people fanning the flames. They took this as evidence to show how the apple doesn't fall from the tree and how easy it is for my mom to throw more than a decade of friendship down the drain. Since I moved to Europe with my husband, my mom is isolated. My father's busy with work and my brother is busy abroad studying. I feel awful when I video call her and she seems depressed seeing her closest friends now scared to even reply to her chat.", "created_utc": 1702475401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hh7cc/aita_for_getting_my_mom_shunned_and_outcasted_by/", "score": 403, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She did nothing wrong. \n\nI cringed when reading \"a mother's decision triumph's a daughter's\"! Their poor children!! And even if their children have to endure this your mother\u00b4s has not. Never would I betray my daughter's decision to keep something secret because my \"friends\" would like to know this.\n\nSeems they were not so great friends after all.\n\nBTW: I guess your MOH\u00b4s moms did know, too. Are they blaming them, too, for not telling before?", "These people are not your mothers friends. And they're behaviour shows how they're own children reacted. Firstly  I would say thankyou to your mother for standing up to them.  If your mum is able, this is the perfect time to take up a mew hobby or class somewhere. ( Maybe invite her tonstay over at your new home for a few weeks? A mini break?) Turn the negative into the positive. Nobody is entitled to a wedding invite. Nobody gets to demand.  It sounds like they were an older bunch of 'mean girl' style bullies.  Anyone who not only attacks, the bride, the mother of the bride, and then the bridal party. Is unhinged.   They are a group of emotional immature toddlers who are clearly used to the \"I want, I get.\" They've never been told No.   So you have actually broken the mould. They don't know how to deal with it.   Them for them to learn. Their feelings are not your responsibility.  Congratulations on your wedding, and good luck on your move xx", "OMG NTA\n\nLet's see...the moms are bullying your mom and their children bullied you. Yeah, the apples don't fall far from the trees.\n\nGood for you for having the wedding you wanted, and I hope your mom can make some new friends. The ones she had were AH's.", "NTA - this is  seriously AH behavior on her friends' part.  My children are around your age and I have known this one friend group their whole lives. I do not expect to be invited to weddings! I want to know about the weddings so I can congrat/send gift - but invited? Never - and honestly I'm not owed even being told", "NTA. Looks like the bullying AH apples didn\u2019t fall far from the bullying AH tree\n\nGood for you for having your wedding for you \n\nGood for your mom for standing up for you to this group \n\nShame on the group for making your wedding about them and their feelings \nMaybe if their kids were decent human beings they would have been invited.", "So the parents of those who bullied you as kids are now bullying your Mom, \"apple doesn't fall far from the tree\" yup, they said it.\n\nDefinitely NTA. Those people are obviously no friends of your Mom's, and it wasn't your fault. You had no reason to invite them, I very much doubt their kids will invite the whole parent group either.", "NTA.  It's YOUR wedding with who you want to invite.  Your mom's friends are not automatically included.  They are just reacting foolishly and creating a whole lot of drama for nothing, sorry for your mom but they aren't good friends.", "This woman were never your mom's friends. \n\nThey are status seekers, and pt stirrers who want to know everyone's business.\n\nYour mother respected you, and what you had been through and so didn't inform them of something happening the life of her extended family (you).\n\nI am sure your mother is hurting.  Just like it hurts in middle school, it hurts as an adult when your friend group turns on you.\n\nCan your mother come and visit you for a vacation, to get away from the reminders?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nFirstly, you said that the weddings of those you know would be extravagant or on skyscraper. But, that's not really in vogue anymore. COVID created a type of wedding called a Micro Wedding and it's in trend. You had a Micro Wedding. A Micro Wedding is just another name for a small wedding with very few people. COVID just created the category because of restrictions. So, your mom's so called 'friends' opinions matter even less than nothing.\n\nSecondly, they're not your mother's friends. Real friends don't  say maniac lines like 'the mothers decision trumps the daughters'.", "NTA. It was an unfortunate consequence of her having the worst kind of friends. You only did what you did to protect yourself and to have your wedding the way you want it. These more or less random biddies actually felt entitled to have a say in your weddding? Incredible. They must be delusional, in which case your mum should be happy to be rid of them.", "NTA. These people sound like absolute lunatics. \u201cA mother\u2019s decision triumph\u2019s a daughter\u2019s\u201d? What is this, the 1800\u2019s? Maybe your mother should have given your fianc\u00e9 a few cows as a dowry to solidify the arrangement. Do they actually expect to have that level of control over their own children\u2019s lives? Then again, with what you\u2019ve described, maybe they do.", "NTA-those ladies were never your mothers friends and are as equally horrible as bullies from your past .\n\n\nSend your mom a link to meet up so she can find some new friends .", "So NTA. \n\nI would contact the daughters and let them know that mom\u2019s wishes completely trump the bride and groom. Suggest that they get mommy dearest under control before their own weddings.", "Info: what culture are you from? I know in some cultures this is a known consequence for not inviting everyone to a family wedding, regardless of the relationship to the bride and groom. Are you from one of these cultures?", "NTA.
