Our small wedding of 8 guests (excluding our parents) happened in my apartment living room, to save for a house in Europe. I made sure to keep my wedding a secret because I didn't want the stress of handling other peoples' reactions, since the usual wedding in my circle is extravagant and at the roof of a skyscraper, or high-end resort/hotel.\n\n*edit: weird sentence structure*\n\nI went to the same school from elementary to high school, and the moms of our batch made a friend group and still socializes to this day. I didn't really keep it hidden from my mom that I was bullied by a great chunk of the batch for most of my years there, so my mom understands how I would prefer to keep the wedding very small instead of being selective and hurting someone's ego. In school, the people who openly bullied me stopped when one of them stood up for me in middle school (we became best friends since and she attended my wedding. Two girls who transferred in after and didn't bully me also became my best friends and were invited to my wedding (I consider all three of them my maid of honor (MOH)).\n\nWe finally posted the wedding and lunch party to social media and my mom's group chat was filled with surprise. I was first in my batch to get married, and sadly, there were less of congratulations and more of angry people expressing betrayal because they weren't informed of, from as far as, my engagement. They expressed that it was congruent to their best friend getting married without getting invited nor informed at all. I felt confused by this, because these people were neither my best friend, nor were I best friends with their child in school. Nevertheless, I told my mom to use me as the excuse to dampen the fire, as I (the bride) wished for this secrecy and not my mom! They instead insisted that it shouldn't have mattered because a mother's decision triumph's a daughter's.\n\nAfter my mom's attempt to reassure them, they turned to painting me as the opportunist narcissist who only cares for herself since I didn't inform them of my wedding, and for using my MOHs for an extravagant wedding, which was far from the truth. A selective group of the parents (in my mom's friend group) started pitting fights between my MOHs and I by personally messaging the MOHs. When that didn't work they pitted my MOHs' moms to each other, which unfortunately somehow worked.\n\nMy mom being overwhelmed by all this blocked the people fanning the flames. They took this as evidence to show how the apple doesn't fall from the tree and how easy it is for my mom to throw more than a decade of friendship down the drain. Since I moved to Europe with my husband, my mom is isolated. My father's busy with work and my brother is busy abroad studying. I feel awful when I video call her and she seems depressed seeing her closest friends now scared to even reply to her chat.\n\n  \n*edit:* Thanks so much for your encouraging words and feedback guys. This really helps me ease my worries. I'll be visiting my mom for a whole month soon! I'll take this time to bring my mom to hobby groups to help her find new friends.

It sounds like they were an older bunch of 'mean girl' style bullies.  Anyone who not only attacks, the bride, the mother of the bride, and then the bridal party. Is unhinged.   They are a group of emotional immature toddlers who are clearly used to the \"I want, I get.\" They've never been told No.   So you have actually broken the mould.

I predict a rash of elopements among the other children of this friend group.", "NTA\n\n\"If this is how your friends treat you, I'd hate to see what your enemies do.\"", "NTA\n\nSounds like they are bullies who taught their kids to be bullies.", "> the apple doesn't fall from the tree \n\nClearly this is why their kids were awful.\n\nNTA.", "I kick I ok ok", "Honestly it seems kind of like a reap what you sow situation unfortunately. Sounds like mom kind of brushed off OPs bullying to keep herself looking good socially and is now surprised the Apple really doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree with the bully\u2019s and their parents. She should have found better friends for herself waaaay earlier or at least learned how to enjoy life by herself.", "Happy cake day!", "They couldn't tell their bratty children not to be bullies but they deserve to be all up im your business because you went to the same school?? They're mad because they wanted your wedding season as an opportunity to judge and critique all about you and you selfishly took that away from them /s", "I am baffled that anyone, never mind a totally grown ass woman with adult children, would want to be friends with those people. \n\nBaffled", "Well now you know why they raised bullies. So sorry this has taken away from your special day and hurt your mom in the process. You both did nothing wrong. Good luck and congrats. NTA", "They wewe bullies' mothers, and the apples didn't fall far from the trees. But why did your mother want to be friends with them, if she knew their daughters were bullying you? It seems like she brought it all upon herself.", "NTA neither is your mother but please point out she needs to be glad of being rid of the trash. \n\nShe respected your decision on your wedding day and they would have wanted you to feel like crap and her seeing you because of their ego s . They are the narcissist AHS and your mother while not seeing it right now will be glad she lost the toxic ahs after she gets over it.\n\nCudos to both of you and congrats\n\nGive her a hug and see if she can't forge friendship with your moh s moms (if you think they are good persons)", "I know my mom really enjoyed beading (making jewelry and other accessories with beads), and those communities can go pretty deep with bead swaps and just going to for lunch or coffee and showing off their newly created bling. If she likes physical hobbies, rock climbing is awesome and there are communities of all ages for that, I know the oldest guy in my gym is in his 80s and going strong.", "Volunteering fills the heart with good feelings. She will meet a much nicer class of human beings.", "Yeah I already didn't understand the mom's group's logic about \"opportunistic and narcissistic\" when it seems the opposite since you kept it small and didn't make yourselves central? Now with this in mind it seems even more nonsensical --- if you were being opportunistic wouldn't you invite the most people to get the most money? Makes absolutely no sense", "No one is entitled to be invited to someone else\u2019s wedding even if they\u2019re family and it might be better for your mum not being friends with people like this who think it okay to bully people.\n\nMy parents and I didn\u2019t expect or feel entitled to be invited to the wedding of my sibling\u2019s best friend but were delighted and grateful when we were invited. But we\u2019d also been close with both the bride and groom for years and considered them part of the family like extra cousins, especially my parents who would regularly have dinner with them without my sibling who moved to another city for a couple of years.", "Good Luck.\n\nYour mother deserves better people in her life.", "It's also important to remember that OP's mom was fine with being friends with the moms of her daughter's bully.  She never realized that these people might be problematic one day?  She never brought up \"hey, your daughter is bullying my daughter\" before?", "> the moms of our batch made a friend group and still socializes to this day. I didn't really keep it hidden from my mom that I was bullied by a great chunk of the batch for most of my years there\n\nI mean ... Her mom knew that she was being bullied by her 'friends' kids and did nothing to stop it or protect her (probably because she was afraid that she'd be socially ostracized then if she stood up for OP too), so realistically they've been bullies the whole time and her mom knew that.", "If they were true friends, then they shoulda been happy for her", "When it's what you have and what you know...", "I wonder how their kids became bullies\u2026", "There's a reason I never got involved with \"mom groups\" with the moms of my kids' classmates. I'm friendly and civil with them, yes, but not super close buddy buddy. Some moms are just catty and I'm not about that.", "> clicky\n\ncliquey", "I humbly disagree that there were no warning signs that these people were crazy.  There's a reason OP had to keep things so secretive in the first place.  She knew that these people would act a fool.\n\nAlso, the fact that OP's mom didn't feel comfortable talking with these folks about their children bullying her daughter is also a sign that she knew dang well that they would turn on her in a heartbeat.  She wanted to live in a mansion built on sand.", "This is why I find the \"apple doesn't fall far from the tree\" comment ironic.", "One of the best things about your children getting older is that you're no longer forced to socialise with their friends' parents. Exceptional that you have anything in common with them, in my experience."]}
