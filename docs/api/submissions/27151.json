But it seems you and her indulge in this lifestyle on the regular. This sounds pretty normal to you, but only when you're there to chaperone her? Also you really seem to be sending mixed signals and maybe that's why she's blown up at you. You ENCOURAGED her to go but then decided you didn't want her going?\n\nI kind if lean towards YTA here.", "You clearly don\u2019t have the same views on nudity.  She is a nudist, so for her it is not about the body strictly being a sexual thing.

However, both of you could work on your communication. It is completely okay for you to feel uncomfortable about nudity in close proximity with friends.  To make a somewhat tenuous analogy, there are lots of people that are happy swingers that make sure they don't swing with people close to them.  There is a certain nuance to camping nude with friends that engaging in nudity together or even by herself doesn't.  Your feelings are just your feelings, regardless of where they come from you should be allowed to express them. However, it does seem like you are sending her mixed signals.\n\nShe is similarly also able to express that this is something important to her and that it as a boundary breaking betrayal because it is non-sexual to her. Her body is her body. However, she should not disregard your feelings. There might be ways for both of you to express boundaries and come up with a clear plan.\n\nJust be prepared for those boundaries not to match. And if that happens then maybe this is a deal breaker.

Whether they are nudists or not - there are boundaries in a monogamous relationship, and sleeping next to the opposite sex naked in the same bed/tent is absolutely one of them unless otherwise agreed upon.

What if the female friends were all lesbians - would that change anything? This is really a male ego thing, and that's what the issue is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot the asshole for FEELING uncomfortable, because you can't help that - it's about how you act on it.

I can\u2019t even get to deciding who the a-hole is because nude camping sounds so incredibly awful. \n\nI love camping, but the thought of getting pine gum on my butt hole, a mosquito bite on my vulva, or scratching my nipples on passing branches horrifies me.", "i think it\u2019s fine to not want to date a nudist, but he\u2019s been dating a nudist and engaging in nudist activities and encouraging her to go on this trip. \n\nso is he okay with her lifestyle or not? if he\u2019s not, he should leave.", "yeah i'm with schafer. this is bait. complete bs post", "ditto to all of that. \n\n+ camping nude is being viewed/phrased as a sexual activity. if being nude was replaced with \u201cyoga\u201d or some other innocent activity, we\u2019d all be calling OP TA.", "No I actually do trust her.

That is not in the post.

Nudists don't view nudism as a sexual venture. Being ok with nudism would mean you are ok with your partner engaging in nudism in normal activities if you are there or not.\n\nIf the issue is being nude around other men while OP isn't around, then OP either views nudism as a somewhat special and slightly sexual activity his does with his gf, or he is jealous and concerned that something will happen between his gf and one of these guys. OP's gf will not be a nudist only when OP is around.\n\n>And despite explaining their misgivings, OP is not telling or even asking their gf to stay at home, but actually urging her to go if she really wants to, as long as she acknowledges OPs discomfort\n\nThis is guilt tripping. Straight up. The basic message was, \"I don't like it, and I'm insulted you would do this without BUT do whatever you want.\" This isn't urging someone to go. It's playing a game.", "Going to nude beaches is not the same as being a nudist. You may want to do some research on that.", "If they were clothed would you care?", "I share tents with people of the opposite sex all the time, albeit clothed/in various states of undress while sleeping. \n\nI think you need to be really honest about *why* you find the tent sharing uncomfortable. Is it that you view nudity as inherently sexual and intimate to some degree, so sharing a sleeping area + nudity feels inappropriate to you? Do you worry being naked together in a more private space might lead to physical intimacy? Is it the length of time (visiting a beach vs a camping trip are two very different things)?\n\nWould you feel the same way if she was sharing a tent while clothed? If not, the only difference here is the nudity. If so, the nudity is not the issue, although it might heighten your emotional response to it.", "Does that mean bisexuals just aren't allowed to share tents platonically if they're in a relationship in your morality? IDK, the ideas about being in a tent together just remind me of the time I went to Jesus camp, and boys and girls weren't allowed in tents together if it was a dozen people in the tent, despite it raining half the time. You're just sleeping in a tent, that's not intrinsically sexual.", "This is why commenters are comparing your situation to a difference in religion- you have extremely different beliefs about nudity. Nudists do not consider being naked sexual, unless they're having sex with whomever they're naked with. Nudists do not perceive being naked around people of other genders risqu\u00e9 or inappropriate. \n\nYou, like many people who are not nudists, *do*. That's why you wouldn't be naked around a bunch of girls - because you consider nudity sexual, at least to an extent. Your partner doesn't. \n\nYou need to consider, based on your beliefs and comfort, whether you have a future with her. Neither of your beliefs are intrinsically immoral, but if you can't compromise they may mean you are incompatible as a couple.", "But you said you urged her to go. Only after you came up with reservations about it. You were not straightforward with her and she can't read your mind.", "All that means is that you have differing expectations/lifestyle choices/standards or whatever.

Because I did for the first few seconds then I noticed it was in europe. \n\nEuropeans have a completely different idea of camping than americans do. \n\nWhile it's outdoors, it more like summer camp with decent to catered food. No ruffing it out back style.", "me neither but i also can\u2019t fathom why anyone wants to have children. i\u2019ve just accepted that different people have completely different mindsets from mine lmao", "I agree with this. The idea that this isn't a sex thing is absurd. Of course it's a sex thing. There's no reason to go camping nude other than to enjoy seeing and/or being seen. It's uncomfortable and impractical. Can you imagine the places you'd get ticks?", "She is a nudist hanging out with friends if you find it so insulting then break up.", "You find it insulting and distasteful because you don't want other men to look at her. This is why your point of view is insulting to HER. She's doing something you were completely aware of that she doesn't feel is sexualized, that she enjoys and has been very upfront about enjoying and even sharing with you, and you are telling her essentially that she's wrong and that another person looking at her body is actually an insult to YOU. That is possessive, that is conservative, and yeah YTA in this dynamic bc you lied about how you felt. Grow up or break up and don't lie to your next partner.", "Why? Is the friend going to lose control and r*pe her in the middle of the night? Is that what you would do?", "So what if they \"check her out\". Why do you care? You don't own her body. \n\nI don't see a problem with friends sharing a tent. You have some weird hang ups and insecurities.\n\nYou're confusing nudity among friends as a sexual act.
