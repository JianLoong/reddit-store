I\u2019ve faked. Not because I didn\u2019t enjoy myself, but because I got tired and I knew he would want to keep going until he succeeded and I just wanted to go to sleep. In fact, cumming during sex is very difficult for me. I still love sex. It still feels good. But even when I cum on my own, it\u2019s just not some mind blowing amazing experience. It feels nice, sure, but all bodies are different and it\u2019s just not my priority during sex. \n\nThis is his hang up. And you\u2019ve tried to explain to soothe his hurt feelings. But he\u2019s refusing to believe your explanations about your body. That\u2019s a dick move on his part.", "NTA. There are multiple studies, but according to the most recent one apparently only 65% of all heterosexual women in the US actually orgasm during sex as opposed to 96% of all men. It's probably even lower in other countries.\n\nAlso, his attitude is throwing up some serious red flags. If his response to finding out that you don't orgasm 100% of the time (which is damn near unheard of) is to throw a big temper tantrum and tell you to go fck other dudes, you have a much more serious problem on your hands because that's honestly unhinged. It sounds like he has quite a fragile ego and I would keep an eye on that behaviour.\n\nIf I don't think I'm going to finish when my partner is going down on me I just tell him \"it's not going to happen today\" and then we just carry on and have sex. I hardly ever orgasm through sex (joys of having ADHD) but it doesn't mean I don't love every second of having sex with him even without the orgasm. If he didn't understand that and threw a strop when I said that or when I didn't come during sex, and made me feel like shit because for whatever reason his ego was tied to my orgasm, I'd probably dump him. \n\nIt's also really shitty of him to put so much pressure on you to perform just so that his ego can be stroked. Sex is supposed to be about two people enjoying an intimate connection with one another, it's not supposed to be some weird orgasm score-keeping game. He clearly has no understanding of female anatomy, it's simply not as easy for us to get there as men and their stroke-it-a-couple-of-times-and-they'll-finish method", "NTA. You're being honest. There's other ways for girls to orgasm every time and it may involve toys. I really don't believe that there's a single woman who hasn't faked an orgasm, or appeared to finish when she didn't.  \n\nI completely agree with you in that pleasure doesn't mean you have to finish. It just feels good to be close and intimate with someone, especially if it's someone you love. If he really cared to pleasure you fully, he would have an open conversation and try different things. \n\nIf both of you are physically satisfied (however that may be), then what's the big deal? It would be a whole different story if you constantly complained that you're not satisfied.", "NTA he\u2019s reacting that way because a man wouldn\u2019t have sex without actually finishing so he\u2019s wondering why you aren\u2019t. Also yeah the journey is great but he should actually be helping you finish. It seems like you were just trying to protect his ego by faking and judging by his reaction he\u2019s pretty immature but he\u2019ll get over it. This is a great opportunity to open up a conversation about what would be good for both of you and to grow together. Best of luck!", "NTA. This exact reaction is why so many people fake orgasms.

You for lying to your partner and then telling about it. And your partner for acting like a spoiled child when his feelings got hurt.\n\nAnd yes, who hasn't faked every once in a while, but never ever tell your partner about it ffs.

You are kinda all over the place. Why say \u201cyes\u201d about faking when you say a couple paragraphs later you\u2019re not sure it counts because you\u2019re a moaner/screamer? \n\nHe\u2019s being a sulky child with his little feelers hurt. I guess you are both young. Chalk it up as a learning experience in communication.", "How would he know what most girls do? 1) He's not a girl. 2) Even if he's had a ton of other partners, that's still not even close to a high enough number to constitue him having an expert opinion on what most girls do, say or think about anything, let alone faking orgasms. Honestly, right up to the point of you adding in the childish things he said, he had a little of my sympathy. I could see where his ego and pride took a hit and felt bad in an \"Oh you poor dear, put a bandaid on your boo boo' kind of way. But instead of growing up and, I don't know, doing BETTER, he had himself a tantrum. What you need to explain is the reason you do, in fact, fake them (not putting words in your mouth, or anything, but this is one of the reasons why I have) is because you're afraid he'd have some childish fit to lash out against his insecurities.*This is where I'd look right at him and say, \"Hmmm, can't imagine why I would think that, can you?. Then kind of shake my head & walk away. Most of the guys I've been with, (not many at all, but certainly nowhere near 'most guys' territory) seem to think like he does. All or nothing. I don't think it really has as much to do with gender as it does with sensitivity. There are big finale people and there are burning ember people. Big finale people don't feel like they got a good show unless there's a big explosion at the end. But burning ember people appreciate the fact that they can take that flame and use it to make anything from a candle to a bon fire, then turn it down and use it again tomorrow. You're a burning ember. He's a big finale. Sometimes it's hard to communicate. But, you were at least respectful and kind in your honesty. He got his feelings hurt and instead of trying to understand and learn, he lashed out. His comment about other guys is so far over the line. Uncalled for. I think you seem like a kind and caring person and a good girlfriend. You have been considerate of his feelings and his pleasure. It's time for him to stop whining and return the favor, but even if he can't , he, at the very least, really needs to stop whining. Good luck OP. I wish you nothing but the best .", "Esh.  He sucks for reacting so poorly, but you suck for lying.  We're not mind readers, and we can't improve without  clear communication, and most importantly, trust. \n\nHowever, his poor reaction really should be raising some red flags.  I get that he's feeling insecure, but there's better ways of expressing oneself.   This is just abusive.", "NTA. Good on you for the honesty. Now he's struggling with his pride. All you can do is remain honest and let him figure out his shit. Don't let him make you feel shitty for it.", "NTA but maybe explain to him or show him this post", "Communicate the issues, don't fake your orgasms.  It's misleading to make your partner think that you are happy and that satisfied with your sex life and your partner has every right to be upset over that.  If he's not hitting the oral quite right tell him so and give him pointers to get better. \n If you're not pleasured, don't lie, communicate because communication is key.  If you guys, as a couple, cannot communicate then yes, go fuck other people because ultimately this relationship is not going to be successful.\n\n\nAnd think about it, how upset would you be if you were given the impression your partner was that satisfied and then get told \"Yeah, I faked it a bunch, it really wasn't 'good enough\" .  Also, you are lying to him when he asks and you say yes when you haven't.\n\n\nSeriously, I've slept with nearly 100 people and have faked an orgasm maybe 5 times.  If I wasn't going to get off then I wasn't going to get off.  I wasn't going to mislead someone, especially a partner.  Communicate, be honest, don't lie to your partner.\n\n\nYTA", "by faking orgasm, you were giving false information to your boyfriend. do you know how to reach orgasm?

He's insecure about it now (or his ego is hurt).\n\nThat being said, people your age make those mistakes (I, 26M) have made some too, it's a learning process. it makes you stronger for it and it's experience you gain. This is an honest mistake (not cheating or anything bad), so don't worry too much about it, don't feel extremely guilty.\n\n=> Give it some time, if he's mature and he truly loves you, he'll get over it. DONT let him use this repeatedly to guilt you into something. You came clean on your own accord, just focus on being truthful about everything from now on.

Don't put up with it.\nYou can try to explain it to him one more time and see if he can be a grown up or not.", "No you are NTA, but you made a mistake saying you faked it, when actually you didn't. You never told him you orgasmed when you didn't when he doesn't feel the difference it's on him.  \n\n\nSecond off all you crushed his ego by telling him you don't always orgasm. If he thinks all women in other relationships do he is delusional.   \n\n\nNo most women don't even get off from penetration at all only by oral and fingering or when masturbating.   \n\n\nBut you 2 are young and he will learn. But keeping sex from you just because he can't pleasure you to orgasm 100% of all times is just childish.  \n\n\nIf he wants you to always orgasm he needs to communicate with you about your needs.  \nWhat feels good, what not. And he also needs to accept that when you are stressed he maybe just shouldn't go for sex at all.

I\u2019m a woman, I get it. Sometimes we fake an orgasm even if we enjoyed sex but were too tired or something. \n\nBut we also fake it - and lie about faking - to protect our partner\u2019s feelings and avoid situations like you have now. This makes faking it a serious disservice to ourselves and our relationship.
