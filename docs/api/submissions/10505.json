I really don't understand people who behave like this. I have two kids that I've had to travel with, but I always brought entertainment for them and tried my best to prevent them from disturbing others. Thankfully they are teenagers now. Traveling with little kids kinda sucks.", "NTA.

As a mother myself, even on a shit day I'd at least attempt to pacify my cranky child. No \"oh I'm having a bad day\" bs.

Turbulence can happen at any point in a flight and a kid stomping around on their seat instead of sitting in it is much more vulnerable to a fall that could cause injuries to themselves as well as OP sitting next to them.  I'd bet a pretty penny that if the child had been injured that way, mother would have been screaming bloody murder and threatening a lawsuit for the results of her own lack of common sense and refusal to be a parent.", "NTA.

Airlines always recommended to sit with your seat belt fashioned even when the light is off incase.", "NTA. \n\n(I\u2019m only partially serious) You could have started handing the kid inappropriate things (but not unsafe) Like given him some gum, told him to chew it then stick it on his mom\u2019s phone.  Or told the kid that if he tapped the window, he could see a bird.  Or started swearing, and ask the boy if he could say those words.  And when mom called you TA, said you would continue to \u201cmisbehave\u201d as long as she did nothing to try to make her kid behave. Or at least put the kid by the window.  \n\nBut, hitting the call button and asking the flight attendant to insist the kid sit in his seatbelt is usually the best choice.", "NTA at all. People need to realise parenting falls squarely on the parents and that they need to raise their kids to become well rounded members of the public. Parents need to ensure that their kids are equipped with appropriate behaviour before taking them on public transport, and ensure that their kids are as minimally disruptive as possible. The fact that the child was both noisy and also doing something extremely unhygienic (standing on seats with shoes which tread dirt from outside, which will then be used to seat other paying customers) shows how poor the parenting is. The child should have been seated, with the seatbelt on, and given some sort of tablet device to keep them busy.\n\nNext time I would raise this with the airline employees onboard the flight so that they can talk to the parent from an airline safety perspective. They can also be aware which seat may need deeper cleaning due to shoes being stomped over the seat. Parents who let kids stand on seats, especially since the pandemic, are gross.", "NTA", "NTA, and as a mom, I would be mortified if my child acted like that. I don\u2019t know how she wasn\u2019t embarrassed.", "NTA. The mom has a responsibility to parent their child, not just ignore it when it's disturbing other passengers. After the mother's response, I would've maintained eye contact as I pressed the \"call attendant\" button and would have relayed my issues to the flight intendent.", "This is a safety issue, in the event of unexpected turbulence the child and surrounding people could be injured. NTA", "you should have gotten cabin crew involved thats a safety issue", "ESH -You don't know what is going on in their life.  You probably don't have children.  Mind your own business.  There is no guarantee a pleasant flight.  Everyone pays for their seat plus that is a short flight.  No one has any patience anymore!", "ESH\n\nHer for letting her child bother other people. You for judging her parenting when her child was just being annoying and impolite, not unsafe. You have no clue what she and her child are going through, maybe this child is autistic or something, and this *is* well-behaved for this child.", "NTA. At this point fight companies just need to do adult only services. I would pay more to go on a long haul flight without kids on it. I live in Australia so flights to America/Europe are 24 hours and I hope I never end up in a situation like this.", "Correction---parents that refuse to parent their children shouldn't have them.", "Took the words right outta my mouth. OP is definitely NTA.", "3-4 is still a toddler. Some places consider 5 to be a toddler as well.", "No, control your kids! It's unsafe for them to be standing on the seat and stomp not to mention mother didn't give a shit and just ignored the kid and sat on her Phone. \n\nThere is a difference between parents trying to calm their kids down or do nothing and piss others when their kid misbehaves.\n\nAnd the difference is easy to spot.", "What is going on in their life doesn't matter. She is obligated to parent her child or deal with people telling her to.", "This kid is standing on the seat and stomping, yeah it's unsafe.", "Standing up on a plane seat is 100% unsafe for not only the child but everyone in a nearby seat.", "Please tell me what esh means. Everyone sucks here?", "No it's not. Why people act like they have no way to parent their own children.", "I'd say once the kid can talk, they aren't a toddler anymore.  3-4 is a preschooler. They should understand that some behavior is not permitted in public, they can definitely understand a parent telling them to quiet down.", "20 minutes into the flight is when the child started this. That was likely at cruising altitude with the seatbelt sign off, so people are free to move about the cabin. OP doesn\u2019t say the seatbelt sign was on, they don\u2019t say that people were asked to remain in their seats, and the flight attendants aren\u2019t asking the child to sit down. There is nothing in here saying the OP felt this was unsafe, just annoying.", "Only when the fasten seatbelt sign is on. A 4YO isn\u2019t much taller than a tall person sitting next to you. And the flight attendants weren\u2019t saying anything.  Besides, OP didn\u2019t say anything about thinking it\u2019s unsafe, just that it\u2019s annoying.", "Yep. There\u2019s four (five) possible votes that the bot counts. I\u2019m going to put spaces between the letters so the bot doesn\u2019t count them here: \n\n* N T A \u2014 Not The A-hole. Meaning the OP isn\u2019t the a-hole here, and someone else is. \n\n* Y T A \u2014 You\u2019re The A-hole. The OP is the A-hole, and no one else is. \n\n* E S H \u2014 Everyone Sucks Here. Both parties are A-holes. (If there are more than two people, this means the OP and at least one other party.) \n\n* N A H \u2014 No A-holes Here. No one is to blame for the situation (or at least none of the relevant parties), or the situation doesn\u2019t rise to the level of A-holes. \n\n* I N F O \u2014 More information is needed to be able to make a decision. This is not a vote that the bot counts, hence it not quite being a vote.", "Yes.", "5 is crazy to call toddler, but 3 is absolutely a toddler.  Not going to argue appropriate developmental skills for the age - I'm much less confident about that - just that they're toddlers (CDC in particular defines a toddler as 2-3 years old.  It's the age where most of them toddle).", "If you think kid standing on seat and stomping is safe and their mother ignoring it is ok, sucks to be on the plane with you or that kid too.", "There is a reason Airlines suggest that you wear your seatbelt even when the seatbelt sign is off.  Roughly 28% of turbulence injuries occur when the seatbelt sign is off per a September 2022 CNN article.  That means that the seatbelt sign would have been off for those incidents.  That's a good indication to me that a child standing in their seat is unsafe, both to itself and to me. \n\n>According to the NTSB, between 2009 and 2018, the flight crew had no warning in about 28% of turbulence-related accidents.\n\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/travel/article/clear-air-turbulence-climate-change/index.html", "OP doesn't have to feel that it was unsafe--it freaking IS unsafe.  Just because a plane is at cruising altitude doesn't ensure glass-smooth flying at all times.  A bump from clear air turbulence and that kid could be significantly injured from hitting the seatback in front of them or slamming down onto either mother or OP.   The mother obviously didn't care a bit about the child's safety or anyone else's.", "Annoying and unsafe, if you don't think what that kid did if unsafe than there is no talking to you.", "It still isn\u2019t the OP\u2019s job to be policing this. I\u2019m not saying the mother is right, my vote is very clearly E S H.", "NTA\n\nThis a safety issue and should be directed to the flight attendant.  The child needs to be seated and belted in.", "NTA I would honestly ask for the flight attendant to get that shit under control you shouldn\u2019t be having to deal with all that because my mother doesn\u2019t want to control her child.", "I have a 3 year old daughter and definitely wouldn\u2019t let her be doing that. Op is NTA", ">You for judging her parenting \n\n\nIgnoring your child and looking at your phone the entire time is now considered \"patenting\"\n\nInteresting. Maybe people shouldn't have children if that is \"parenting\"", "I would have asked the kid to stop screaming, if mom didn\u2019t like it then I would have said something to her about having to do it since she hadn\u2019t but I\u2019m guessing she was so checked out she wouldn\u2019t care she only cared someone was telling her what to do."]}
