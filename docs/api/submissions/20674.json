I've asked him so many times to stop. \n\nWell, last night I was taking a shower and he comes in and says \"babe, look\" while laughing.

Ask him how many photos he has of the kids on his phone. Ask him to show them. Then, ask him how many photos he has of YOU on his phone. Ask to see them. Ask him why he thinks he has hundreds of photos of the dog and almost none of the kids. Ask him how often he wants to show you something cute with the kids. Let him piece this all together. Then, explain that his obsession with this dog is impacting his relationship with you and the kids, and you are not going to feed into it. Moving forward, you don't want him to \"show\" you anything else with the dog. Reassure him that you see the dog a lot when he's gone and notice how cute she is, but you don't need to be \"shown\" her outside of that. None of you need to be shown her.

If you hadn\u2019t already tried talking to him about it, I\u2019d say maybe he thinks you\u2019re just as enthralled with the dog as he is.
