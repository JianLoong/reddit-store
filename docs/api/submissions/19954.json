Girl if he's a good boyfriend he'll cut that bloke off himself. What a gross thing to say.", "NTA. It\u2019s creepy and odd.

Communication is also always great to get distress out of your mind.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA. Your boyfriend would probably WANT to know that the friend said this to you. It was completely inappropriate.", "YWNBTA.\n\nGo ahead and tell your BF if you want. It probably won't change the friend's behaviour and don't expect your BF to dump them as a friend. You can choose not to hang out with his friends if you don't want to, however. At the end of the day you don't have to get along with his friends, he chose them and he's entitled to do that, they're not your friends and being polite and civil is all that's required for your BF's sake.\n\nUnfortunately the comment has long since passed, you should have called him out on making inappropriate, unsolicited comments about women's bodies. And it was a medical opinion too, is he a Dr? With men like this they don't learn unless you pull them up immediately. It's like when a dog shits in the carpet and they forget about it 5 minutes later.", "While, technically, if you have narrow hips it MAY be more difficult in childbirth, it's such a WEIRD thing to say to someone like that, and totally understandable to be uncomfortable about.\n\nDefinitely wouldn't be an asshole for telling your bf.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you hope to have a good relationship with your boyfriend then you need to be honest with him. You need to let him know what his so called friend said to you and that in the future you prefer not to be around him.

The only way to get respect is to treat yourself with respect!!!", "NTA.  What a nasty thing to say.  And ignorant, unless he's your doctor.  This guy sounds like a condescending jerk.  I'm glad your other friend called him out.  That's the one to keep.", "Yeah totally NTA, but you wanting not to get in this toxic drama between you, your BF, and his friend is a bit understanding but it would help to tell him, many relationships break apart because of toxicity or just plain communication", "Nta but as someone who just says stuff even though it's not considered cool.
