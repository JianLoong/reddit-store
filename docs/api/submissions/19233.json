He was the adult being disrespectful, he can\u2019t then turn around and get mad at you for calling him out on what he was doing.", "NTA. \nYou did good. \n\nI'm gonna make some comments for perspective. \n1. Your uncle might feel like a failure one way or the other, and lashes out towards his sister's family cause he's hurting. Doesn't mean he did right, just that you and your family shouldn't take it personally. \n\n2. Do something about your brothers hearing. One mistake people who seek the root of a problem do, is not dealing with the problem as it is. \nIt doesn't matter WHY he became like that. What matters is how to reduce the effect. \nYou mentioned autism.... If he had been an autist, your parents would probably provide him with a headset and access to music that calms him. \nSo why not do the same?  What works for autists, ADHDs and construction workers will work for your brother too. His chances of growing out of it are reduced by him being triggered, but will increase by providing him a method for dealing with it. \n\n3. As unpleasant your uncle was, he does have a point. If your parents can't protect your brother from sound trauma, then they are failing him. Doesn't mean they're bad parents, and that they haven't tried. But they need to up their game. It was thoughtless of them not to remove your brother as soon as things became loud. \nOr earplugs and headset. \n\n4. There's something called Auditory Processing Disorder. It is seldom diagnosed, even if it's not that rare. Your brother could have developed PTSD as a side effect of it. Just a thought...\nBut still, earplugs and headset. \n\n5. (Last point). Autists, ADHD and APD (Auditory Processing Disorder), plus PTSD and most other conditions, will sometimes also let themselves be diverted from reactions to sounds. Meaning they can manage sounds if their minds focus on something else. It's easier when they are older, and in a bit more control of their immediate reactions. So earplugs and headset are not for life. Later your parents will find things he's interested in to bring along in case of emergency. An easy one is lending him a cell phone to play an easy game, like Angry Birds. Some love books or Rubik's Cube or drawing. He will, with some help master his reactions to high noices.\nOh, and sucking on a piece of chocolate helps a bit too because of its impact on serotonin levels (calming dopamine). But it takes a while before it hits, so it's not something that gives immediate effect. But your brother might learn to suck patiently, while the noise happens, to reap the calming effect later. It's something he can use when he gets even older. \n\nPS! You're a good brother to reach out as well as protecting your little brother. \nHope your family will figure things out.", "NTA", "NTA, there are always critics when someone does heroic shit because watching someone else do the brave thing makes cowards realize they don\u2019t have the guts.

Did **SHE** always defend uncle and let him get away with things?  Was he never disciplined or were there never consequences for his behavior or actions?  I'm betting not, so uncle became a big blow hard, bully, ahole and the family enables him to continue this attitude and behavior because all his life he's gotten a free pass...thanks to Grandma making others put up with his crap.

I feel so morbid giving examples, but that could\u2019ve happened in a variety of ways, like if he was involved in a loud, scary car accident. \n\nADHD is a processing disorder\u2014basically, ADHDers have to manually filter out environmental stimulants whereas other people automatically do this, and it can be extremely overwhelming to handle at times. I always sat still in class, I\u2019m female, and I got good grades in school, so of course I wasn\u2019t diagnosed with ADHD until I was 26. Even though I am usually totally calm and composed, there were times at my last job where I\u2019d be brought to tears: my desk was in a busy hallway, so all day long I\u2019d hear people typing and talking, the noisy ceiling creaking, the AC/heat buzzing, my own computer humming\u2026 any time it rained and another noise was added to the cacophony, I was past my limit. My work environment was so uncomfortable and caused me such distress that I ended up having to quit! It takes a LOT of mental energy to process so many environmental stimulants all at once\u2026 the noises plus the harsh light and the feeling of constantly being way too cold was a perfect storm, and I\u2019d go home exhausted after work every day with these cold, pounding headaches between my eyes. \n\nI wonder if this might be your brother\u2019s experience? Poor little guy might just be overwhelmed as it is taking in all of the elements of his surroundings; maybe adding extra noise on top of it is just too much.\n\nAlso, your comment was more than justified considering your uncle was so insanely out of line by insinuating that your parents are going to \u201cruin\u201d your brother by validating his experiences and emotions. He\u2019s drastically wrong, of course\u2014ignoring a child\u2019s obvious distress and need for adult comfort is what ruins people and causes them to grow up to be coldhearted adults who can\u2019t empathize with others and continue to struggle with the lingering consequences of having been taught to suppress their own feelings.", "Hi OP, have your family tried noise cancelling earphones?

I now fucking love loud music (to my wife's dismay) and especially enjoy rock concerts and movie theaters that really crank the audio. I can't really tell you what it was that got me passed my fear, I honestly just think it was growing up, maturing, and slowly growing used to it. \n\nAs someone who had serious issues with loud noises I want to tell you that you are a *fantastic* sibling.
