Same with the other tasks. \n\nSo what is your plan for when - not if - she doesn\u2019t follow through? Will you step up and take care of the dog?

Even if she were to agree, as she grew, went off to college, etc. she might not be able to follow through.  Any dog needs to be seen as a family pet, with the adults having primary responsibility, and guiding the children to help with the care at an age-appropriate level.  \n\nYour boyfriend has already said he's not considering himself responsible.  And it sounds as if you are not currently working for pay, but are instead caring for his toddler.  This is a situation that leaves you vulnerable.  You don't have the legal protections of marriage, but you're taking the responsibilities of a 1950s housewife.  Having to care for a dog would be one more thing to tie you into this situation, where he makes commitments but doesn't take responsibility.  \n\nIf your daughter wants a pet, start with a smaller, shorter-lived pet, such as a goldfish or hamster.  Work with her on actually caring for it, so she gets an idea of the day-to-day responsibility involved.  (This also provides a good conversation opener for the responsibilities that come with having a child, an for education about sex, birth control, responsible family planning, etc. which are topics that, at 13, she needs to become educated about before it becomes a crisis.)\n\nA puppy is not a \"starter\" pet, it is a labor intensive long-term commitment.", "NTA, \n\n>she will have to take care of it.\n\nIsn't that what all pet owners do, also I don't see you being wrong, she would have to take responsibility of her pet if she gets one", "NTA.

If she is not willing to use any of her allowance to feed the dog, and if she doesn't have time to take the dog on walks and play with the dog then it's not fair for the dog. It's clearly a terrible idea for her to get the dog even if she agrees, but hopefully understanding how much work is involved will be enough to get her to reach the correct decision, which is to not get a dog.", "YTA\n\nNot because your rules are unreasonable, but because you\u2019re asking something impossible of a 13yo.

Puppies are like human babies, in that they are dumb and unaware of all the ways they can get hurt, but have the extra fun bonus of being fully able to sprint into oncoming cars by the time they're old enough to adopt.\n\nI adopted a high energy breed earlier this year. She was a 3 month old golden retriever/border Collie/husky mix. I went into this fully prepared and with fantastic conditions; I work from home, have a yard, live with multiple other people who could help, am an experienced dog owner,  she was coming from being fostered by the rescue, so she was already crate trained and potty trained. \n\nAnd even so, I nearly broke down crying multiple times from the stress she brought to my life during the first month. Between her mix of breeds and her young age, she's incredibly high energy. I've basically had to rearrange my life around her. \n\nShe's now 9 months old, and doing much better, but a lot of that is because of the hours of training I poured and continue to pour, by myself, with a trainer and in puppy classes. I've also gotten into a routine, so she gets a bunch of exercise every day, whether it be a 5 mile walk, a play date with my friends dogs, long training sessions with her dinner, nose work, hiking on the weekends, etc. \n\nEvery day I do something interesting to tire her out and help her socialize and strengthen our bond and her training. It's usually fun, but I've definitely had to rework my schedule to make that work. \n\nYour daughter is 13, she is not ready for that level of commitment. You could maybe look into getting a 1-2 year old dog of a different breed, there's a bunch of fuzzy dogs just as adorable as Aussies who are total couch potatoes and down to go for walks a few times a week, but don't NEED  to run daily marathons.\n\nOr if you'd like to have your daughter learn for herself, you could work with a rescue and foster a dog! Fostering is an amazing opportunity to help a dog, often puppies, socialize and learn to be around humans before finding their forever homes. \n\nShe would get a glimpse into what her life with a dog would be like, how much work even non-high energy breeds are, and how much training a young pup actually needs before you get the loving companion you see on TV. I don't think most people realize young pups are tiny land sharks with super sharp baby teeth who haven't learned that they can't use your arms and legs as chew toys.\n\nBest part, fostering can be for as little as 2-3 weeks, usually just while they vet applicants and make sure the puppy is going somewhere safe.", "NTA. I think you're being rather fair and generous with your offer. A high energy breed like an Australian Shepherd probably won't be a good fit for an inexperienced owner/teen like your daughter. I suggest doing some dry runs of things that she'd have to do to take care of a dog. She has to go on 15-20 mins walks at specific times of day, even if the weather is gross, every day for a month. She can't miss a single day. This means she can't sleep in on weekends because she has to walk. Getting a pet is a big commitment that should be carefully considered and agreed upon by the entire household.", "Setting rules and boundaries is reasonable, but a 13 year old isn't going to be consistent enough for a puppy, so even if she agrees, you will need to take care of the dog if she doesn't follow through.

There may be breeds on there that you've never heard of, or that you wouldn't think as a fit. And then go through that list one by one, read about the breed, look at pictures, maybe visit a dogshow to see what they look like (AKC - and other Kennel Clubs around the world-  often has \"meet the breed\" stands or similar at their larger events, where a breeder or owner is more than happy to talk about the breed while you get a look at it up close and personal)\nI wouldn't recommend getting a rescue with a 3yo in the house.. you don't know what you bring home.", "This is why you should never let your kid watch Bluey", "NTA and nope.
