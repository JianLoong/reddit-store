Same with the other tasks. \n\nSo what is your plan for when - not if - she doesn\u2019t follow through? Will you step up and take care of the dog?

Even if she were to agree, as she grew, went off to college, etc. she might not be able to follow through.  Any dog needs to be seen as a family pet, with the adults having primary responsibility, and guiding the children to help with the care at an age-appropriate level.  \n\nYour boyfriend has already said he's not considering himself responsible.  And it sounds as if you are not currently working for pay, but are instead caring for his toddler.  This is a situation that leaves you vulnerable.  You don't have the legal protections of marriage, but you're taking the responsibilities of a 1950s housewife.  Having to care for a dog would be one more thing to tie you into this situation, where he makes commitments but doesn't take responsibility.  \n\nIf your daughter wants a pet, start with a smaller, shorter-lived pet, such as a goldfish or hamster.  Work with her on actually caring for it, so she gets an idea of the day-to-day responsibility involved.

If she is not willing to use any of her allowance to feed the dog, and if she doesn't have time to take the dog on walks and play with the dog then it's not fair for the dog. It's clearly a terrible idea for her to get the dog even if she agrees, but hopefully understanding how much work is involved will be enough to get her to reach the correct decision, which is to not get a dog.", "YTA\n\nNot because your rules are unreasonable, but because you\u2019re asking something impossible of a 13yo.

When I say he's eager to please, I mean there are some days he will *refuse to eat* if we haven't run through enough commands with him. Thank god for off-leash dog parks and chuck-it slings.", "This\u2b06\u2b06\u2b06", "Yeah you are correct, if we were to get it I wouldn\u2019t neglect it if she weren\u2019t taking care of it, but I feel like doing everything myself would just teach her the opposite of what I am trying to.", "completely 100% agree with this i think it\u2019s a very smart answer. when your children aren\u2019t independent, this should be a FAMILY dog. you\u2019re old enough to understand the responsibility and your daughter is not. by the way you talk, it shows you expect your daughter to be fully responsible- e.g. all the walks, food, discipline, etc. but when your daughters caught up with school and her own coming-into-teenage-years emotions, she can\u2019t handle it. i promise you", "And your BF is foolish.", "I said \u201cI will train it as I feel like it will workout better\u201d. I think I\u2019m going to see if she would either be willing to get a different breed, or wait a few years and do her research then think about the Australian shepherd.", "Just wanted to mention: Goldfish can live longer than dogs. Lifespan of 10-30 years.", "Fish are more likely to die than dogs.", "Price out vet care. It is very costly, even if your dog is healthy.", "Getting a pet should be a unanimous decision.  If there\u2019s one nay then it shouldn\u2019t happen.", "My dog's last physical and vaccine visit cost $349. Who will pay those bills?", "I always thought it went like this (and of course all dogs are different, I am generalizing)\n\n\nAustralian Cattle Dog - hell no. That is a dog from hell\n\n\nBorder collie. - smart as hell with lots of energy but a good dog at heart\n\n\nAustralian shepherd - more chill than both of the above though still a dog.", "It would, but that\u2019s exactly why this isn\u2019t the right approach. You\u2019re setting it up so that you either back track on your \u201clesson\u201d or let the dog be neglected. That\u2019s not fair to any of you, least of all the dog. \n\nEither approach it as a family commitment and responsibility knowing it will be mostly you or just don\u2019t get the dog.", "That\u2019s so true.", "What\u2019s the plan for college? This isn\u2019t a great age to get a dog imo between extracurriculars and a social life", "I would not get the dog if I was you OP.\n\nDogs live a very long time, sometimes up to 15 years.\n\nYour daughter who is 13 at the time right. She will go to college/university if she decides to go. She will graduate if she goes to school. Your daughter will get then married and have kids if she decides. Which might be when she is 27 years old. Daughter might decide to stay wherever she is at and not come back. Or move somewhere else.\n\nGuess who will still have the dog while your daughter is long gone? You will end up with the dog and will having to take care of it. All while your daughter is living her life completely forgetting the dog she wanted.\n\nGetting a dog would be bad for the dog, your daughter and for you. I would seriously think twice or more on it.", "Don't get a dog if you expect your daughter to do that much work, because it's unlikely she'll stick with it. Get a dog if *you* want to have (and keep) a dog, because your daughter is not going to be able to take a dog off to college with her (not to mention that she will probably have roommates and/or have to rent apartments for at least a few years after graduating, and she'll be at the beginning of her working years and have minimal flexibility, which is not ideal for a high-energy working dog). \n\nAlso, please don't (and please teach your daughter not to) only consider puppies and specific breeds. There are literally millions of wonderful dogs that are suffering in shelters, just waiting for someone to give them a good, loving home. And while puppies are adorable, they are also a hell of a lot more work (akin to a baby), and they're only tiny, adorable puppies for a couple of months. There", "My bad. I misread that. I apologize.", "Like I said, that wasn\u2019t the agreement I had with my parents, and if you\u2019re asking a kid to pay that when you\u2019re the one buying the dog you\u2019re the AH.\n\nWhich is why that\u2019s not the agreement op gave kid either", "I've got 2 Aussies that are absolute crack raptors and I'm working towards buying a rural home so I can let them do their thing. I live in an apartment with no yard and they're both reactive and have to be on medication for me to be able to take them out to potty.\n\nBorder Collies are absolutely a thousand times worse and even when I have a home I'll never ever ever get a border collie. I've watched one repeatedly try to climb a filing cabinet because it wanted to see what was on top. They have no off button and are insanely intense on top of being incredibly intelligent and are not meant to be a house / family pet; they'll drive everyone and everything insane out of boredom."]}
