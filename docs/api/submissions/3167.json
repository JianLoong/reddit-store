No. Then don\u2019t test the recovering addict.", "Absolutely yta. Bro's got 3 years clean. Will you ever see past his past?", "YTA.  What you did was incredibly damaging.

He has been in recovery for three years and you treated him like he is a criminal. Shaming him for his addiction is not OK.

There are the physical effects of drug use on the body/brain, sure. But even once they make it past that, there are people like you who will never allow them to be treated like a normal human being. Besides that, you AND YOUR WIFE hosted Thanksgiving. You and your wife agreed to invite her brother.

It sounds like he's really hurt your wife in the past, and that can be hard to get over.

You did this as a punishment.", "Interesting that you felt it appropriate to humiliate your BIL because you don\u2019t trust him, but meanwhile you are actively deceiving your own wife.", "Wow. And you still had to ask reddit if your an asshole? Lmao major asshole.", "The irony that you're doing this to \"protect your wife\" while blatantly disrespecting her wishes", "Yes, your behavior is concerning. I\u2019d request that you take the test in this scenario. \n\nWhat did you do after the test came back clean? Did you apologize in any way and/or did you commend BIL on their sobriety? Did you let him know this is a requirement to enter your home going forward? \n\nCan you walk me through what you did starting from that point? \n\nIf this is how you want to handle him going forward, discuss it with your wife and then make it clear to BIL that he can\u2019t step foot in your home without a test. Don\u2019t ambush him. I think that sucks, but I also understand that he\u2019s put his sister through a lot over the years.", "What would you want for him to \"make amends\"? \n\nIt is fine to never trust him, but he is your wife's brother -- you have to learn to at least be civil to the dude.", "Don\u2019t weaponize language you\u2019ve heard associated with anonymous recovery groups, especially when you\u2019re doing it incorrectly. \n\nStep 8 (NA): \u201cWe made a list of all people we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.\u201d\n\nStep 9 (NA): \u201cWe made direct amends to such people wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others.\u201d\n\nNote: I\u2019m writing with the assumption your BIL is part of a 12-step group or has had exposure to one in the past. If he\u2019s ever attended any rehab program, including outpatient, he has. ANYWAY. \n\nRegarding step 8, even if your BIL owes you amends, he either may not be working that step yet, in which case making an amends as big as the one you desire would be wildly irresponsible. Alternatively, he may not be willing to make amends with you yet, which would also cause any attempts of his to to do so to be wildly irresponsible, and not in line with the purpose of the step at all, because he wouldn\u2019t be sorry! Additionally, living amends are ALSO a type of amends (at least in NA), and the only kind an addict can make before formally completing steps 8 and 9. Living amends are the ones you make not by speaking, but by acting. If an addict stole habitually, they stop stealing and pay back the money. If an addict lied constantly, they begin to tell the truth. Your BIL used drugs for years, and now he\u2019s spent three years not using drugs on purpose. His recovery and abstinence from drugs is a living amends. He\u2019s already begun doing what he is able. Also, why would you think he owes you amends before he makes them with your wife? \n\nRegarding step 9, you may have noticed the verbiage about harm addresses \u201cthem\u201d (those we directly harmed) and \u201cothers\u201d (those who may be harmed by our attempts to make amends at a given time). Fun fact: addicts, who are people too, fall under the category of \u201cothers\u201d. For example, an addict may have punched their ex-partner in self defense after being subjected to domestic violence for months. We all generally agree that hitting people is objectively wrong. HOWEVER, finding that ex to say sorry would be harmful to the addict making the amends, because it would force them to make contact with their abuser. Perhaps your BIL isn\u2019t able to make amends with you because you\u2019re a caustic jerk who has made it abundantly clear you wish he was anywhere but near you and that you will never think of him as anything more than a worthless junkie? I know if I had to speak to someone who felt that way about me, I would be causing myself harm, thereby flying in the face of the intent of the 9th step. \n\nYou don\u2019t know a thing about recovery. It\u2019s a culture, it\u2019s a language, it may even be a cult, but you are an outsider. Don\u2019t ask for what you don\u2019t understand. \n\nYTA.", "People aren't perfect and addiction is a disease. I think OP also revealed himself as a cruel and suspicious person. The moment the test was clean he lost.", "I understand that a huge number of people are unable to kick the habit permanently and on top of it can and will steal to feed it. It\u2019s so hard to watch and close family is often in denial (been there). I get your reluctance. You want to trust him but have been burned over and over.\n\nThat said springing it when he got there was an AH move.\n\nOne good thing that came out of it is your confidence in his successful treatment should be much higher than it was yesterday. The rest of the family that was dreading a backslide probably feels better.\n\nI think you need to do some groveling to your BIL right now.", "Of course she does but I know she would have said no.", "I dunno.

Good.\n\nOP is pissed at past behavior and doesn't want his wife (and himself) to go through that again. Understandable.\n\nEveryone is jumping down OP's throat. But, how many of them have been on posts, for example, where MIL treated OP like shit, put her (it's usually DIL who is OP), down, and made them feel like shit. Then MIL seems to want to reconcile.

In what way does that translate to her having a say?", "So she has a say in the decisions, but you don't listen to them because you know what is best for her \n\nyeah, this whole post is gonna be exhibit A when she divorces your ass. \n\ncongrats on ruining your marriage! i hope showing up your BIL was worth it!\n\nalso, you sound so much like a cop that it is scary.  I'm 99% sure you are a cop.", "So, in other words, you didn't give her a fucking say in what you pulled.", "The difference in those situations is that her brother has been clean for THREE YEARS.

You could've been a little more diplomatic about it.", "why didn't you talk it over with your wife then. he's her brother and it's also her home", "Yeah. INFO about how he's 3 years sober. Is it just from BIL?", "No, in what manner or way could he ever make amends to you? Is there anything he could do to get even okay-ish with you?", "What could he do to make amend for those things?", "For stealing I understand, that was wrong of him.\n\nBut his sister worrying about him? For visiting him in hospital? Would you ask a cancer patient to make \"amends\" for all that? Addiction isn't a choice, it's not his fault. Your wife worried because she loves him. You don't have to apologise for someone worrying over your health. You think my mum needs to apologise and make it up to me over the time she was in hospital for a blood clot? Or my uncle needs to apologise to the entire family when he had cancer and was really ill?", "And if MIL had changed over 3 years (not saying anything bad)? Would that be enough to keep her away?\n\nFor me, the important issue is WHO said that he's been clean for 3 years.

He had absolutely zero right to do this to the brother.\n\nIf MIL had shown substantial change for three years and tried to fix her issues, then no, that\u2019s not enough to keep her away.

If OP was not convinced he\u2019s clean and/or just doesn\u2019t want him around, then open your mouth and say that and just don\u2019t invite him. That in itself might open up a different argument, but it\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nFirst of all we don\u2019t even know what drugs BIL was using. For how long can they be detected with this test after use? Even if BIL passes the test he might not actually be clean depending on the drug in question.

Second, he does not have to trust him, but if he doesn\u2019t he should not invite him to his house.  Since he did not want his BIL there, and his wife does, if this was going to be a condition he should have told his wife ahead of time.", "I wouldn't trust a thief after 3 years.
