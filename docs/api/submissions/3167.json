No. Then don\u2019t test the recovering addict.", "Absolutely yta. Bro's got 3 years clean. Will you ever see past his past?", "YTA.  What you did was incredibly damaging.

He has been in recovery for three years and you treated him like he is a criminal. Shaming him for his addiction is not OK.

There are the physical effects of drug use on the body/brain, sure. But even once they make it past that, there are people like you who will never allow them to be treated like a normal human being. Besides that, you AND YOUR WIFE hosted Thanksgiving. You and your wife agreed to invite her brother.

You knew he had been clean and sober for 3 years. Yet, you decided to take it upon yourself to demand that he take a test before he could spend time with his family?

It sounds like he's really hurt your wife in the past, and that can be hard to get over.

If he\u2019s ever attended any rehab program, including outpatient, he has. ANYWAY. \n\nRegarding step 8, even if your BIL owes you amends, he either may not be working that step yet, in which case making an amends as big as the one you desire would be wildly irresponsible. Alternatively, he may not be willing to make amends with you yet, which would also cause any attempts of his to to do so to be wildly irresponsible, and not in line with the purpose of the step at all, because he wouldn\u2019t be sorry! Additionally, living amends are ALSO a type of amends (at least in NA), and the only kind an addict can make before formally completing steps 8 and 9. Living amends are the ones you make not by speaking, but by acting. If an addict stole habitually, they stop stealing and pay back the money. If an addict lied constantly, they begin to tell the truth. Your BIL used drugs for years, and now he\u2019s spent three years not using drugs on purpose. His recovery and abstinence from drugs is a living amends. He\u2019s already begun doing what he is able. Also, why would you think he owes you amends before he makes them with your wife? \n\nRegarding step 9, you may have noticed the verbiage about harm addresses \u201cthem\u201d (those we directly harmed) and \u201cothers\u201d (those who may be harmed by our attempts to make amends at a given time). Fun fact: addicts, who are people too, fall under the category of \u201cothers\u201d. For example, an addict may have punched their ex-partner in self defense after being subjected to domestic violence for months. We all generally agree that hitting people is objectively wrong. HOWEVER, finding that ex to say sorry would be harmful to the addict making the amends, because it would force them to make contact with their abuser. Perhaps your BIL isn\u2019t able to make amends with you because you\u2019re a caustic jerk who has made it abundantly clear you wish he was anywhere but near you and that you will never think of him as anything more than a worthless junkie? I know if I had to speak to someone who felt that way about me, I would be causing myself harm, thereby flying in the face of the intent of the 9th step. \n\nYou don\u2019t know a thing about recovery.

Remember this long of sobriety could mean death the next relapse.", "And what would that look like?", "Has he made amends to her?", "So he should have to wallow in remorse instead of moving on with his life in a healthy and productive way?", "If you felt guilty and apologised over it, then that's fine, but you didn't owe them an apology over it. People worry about the ones they care about, it's natural. When you're sick, they will worry, regardless of what the illness it. Apologising is sweet, but not necessary. If you do something bad to them then yeah, but them worrying over you is not your fault or something to feel bad over, there's no blame. An apology shouldn't even be in the equation unless you were cruel to them or robbed them", "No one said you\u2019re obligated to trust addicts. That\u2019s really disingenuous of you to pretend they are. Pointing out that certain actions are not supportive or appropriate is not the same as saying you\u2019re obligated to trust addicts.\n\nAnd just because you\u2019re in your rights to do something doesn\u2019t make that action smart, reasonable, moral, etc, etc. Being *allowed* to do something is the lowest bar when talking about whether you\u2019re in the right or wrong.", "Oh even in the hospital for my Crohn\u2019s I won\u2019t let them give me any opiates.", "We do trade one vice for another, mine is wood working now", "Based on the post, I don't know if OP initially gave the okay:\n\nAs a condition of his attendance, when he got to our house, I presented him with a drug test and told him he would only be allowed to stay and attend dinner if it came back clean.\n\nSome important info is missing. If OP said it was okay and sprung it at the door, OP is at fault. If OP had brought it up before, then he's not at fault. \n\nAnd it's also very important what drugs were being used. I don't think it was weed. It sounds to me more like meth or heroin.", "We're going to have to disagree here. I've dealt with addicts who were close to me (drugs and gambling). I've cut them off after a lot of trying to help. Unless they showed me how they've corrected themselves and made actual steps to atone, I'm done. \n\nAnd, if they had stolen and hurt my wife? Nah. Double that. I'd do what I could to keep them away.", "Happy thanksgiving to you, your husband and adorable cats!", "Yes, you should make amends to the people you've hurt, bizarre concept right?\n\n\"It was in the past, I've moved on I don't owe anyone anything\" is asshole mentality. If you wrong people, you have a moral right to make an effort to fix that. \n\nOP is an asshole, but god is this sub out of touch sometimes.", "Actually the person above you said that iff we dont we arent being supportive.", "So are you implying it's immoral to distrust addicts, or somehow smart to trust them? Because you're acting like it's purely because it's \"allowable\", rather than morally justifiable and the right thing to do large chunks of the time.\n\nHonestly, it feels like you're just upset by the reality that you cannot trust an addict and there is nothing immoral, foolish or unreasonable about distrusting one.\n\nBecause I'm not sure what it is you're taking exception to here.", "I would have to think OP knew he was coming unless he\u2019s in the habit of keeping drug tests around the house just in case. \n\nAnd if they had discussed it beforehand, why would his wife and BIL get mad in the first place? He would have shown up expecting it.", "Except the wife wants him there. OP has two options at this point. Grow up and get over this grudge, because it\u2019s been three years. He\u2019s the only one with any issue. \n\nOr he can leave. That\u2019s it.", "Making amends doesn't mean be eternally remorseful. Going through recovery means forgiving yourself as well. Wallowing in self loathing is a good way to relapse.", "> I think the other person's point is that, assuming he hasn't ever  relapsed and is clean still, **that being *overtly* suspicious/untrusting isn't being supportive of their recovery.**\n\nNo\u2026they didn\u2019t say that. They didn\u2019t say you can\u2019t be on your guard or watch your back. But being overtly suspicious and rude is not supportive.", "> So are you implying it's immoral to distrust addicts, or somehow smart to trust them? \n\nNo, and the reason you had to put the whole \u201cso you\u2019re implying\u201d is because you can\u2019t find anything in my comment that actually says that. So you have to lie and twist my words around.\n\nIf you have to lie and make up an argument to respond to, maybe you don\u2019t have a point? \n\n> Honestly, *it feels*\n\nYou\u2019re saying it feels because you can trick yourself into feeling anything.", "There's a lot of missing info here. \n\nI agree that it sounds like he knew BIL was coming. He was against it (obviously). OP doesn't trust BIL (obviously). OP is trying to protect his wife and himself (probably). OP went about it in a wrong way (definitely).", "It's not, but I would hope that you agree making amends or at the very least acknowledging your wrongs is mandatory.\n\nBecause that's very much not an optional step. Self loathing is un productive, but that doesn't mean you get to just walk away from what you've done."]}
