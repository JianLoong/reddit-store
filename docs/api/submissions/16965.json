Probably best to block that clowns number especially before he asks you to babysit again.", "NTA \n\n\nTbh, it was smart not to leave. Let's say something happened to the child, and he has proof of you accepting responsibility for said child. You could be on the hook for liability.", "NTA. You did a job and got paid.

But ask why the girlfriend can't be trusted with childcare. The relationship could just be too young to trust her sharing this kind of responsibility.", "Helll no you should not have left the child in that womans care. If i paid u and find out u left my kid with someone i didnt ask to babysit id have thrown u under the bus as a bad friend. You have no idea why he never asked gf to babysit. Maybe the relationship isnt at that level yet. You would have seriously broken my trust in that case. But i would reach out to dude and be like wtf. He may not even know shes meddling.

I did not and very few people I knew did either so I guess I\u2019m biased in assuming that most everyone lies or speaks in ways to benefit themself in an effort to avoid being yelled at, punished, spanked (or worse), etc. \n\nBasically, you become trained to lie you avoid conflict and punishment. True, this usually catches up to people and makes the problem worse but most people are just trained to communicate like this (in my experience, anyway). \n\nSo someone could be very well-meaning but if they sense that someone will react poorly to something, they\u2019ll lie to avoid that reaction.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this behavior is good but I recognize it for what it is.", "I mean, I'll point out in this situation, girlfriend showed up when she knew he wasnt going to be home, accused him of being unfaithful, insulted OP for babysitting, refused to understand that babysitters exist to get paid, and demanded OP leave the kid.\n\nIn an average situation, maybe you're right that lying was the issue and not someone being crazy. But in this situation, this woman can't even understand basic concepts that happens every day everywhere like babysitting", "She probably has his phone btw.", "Ffs, can none of you people read. Here I\u2019ll copy and paste it: \n\n\u201cHey, look, if you want to take over, fine, but you need to have HIM confirm with me that I\u2019m able to turn the kid over to you.\u201d", "Absolutely this!  We have no idea what the intentions were of the GF with unfettered access to this child. The fact that she was insisting so hard that you leave and she be alone with the child is suspect- she either has bad intentions, or is placing herself over the needs of the child. Both are really bad.", "Honestly GF seems a bit over possessive and toxic if she's demanding the babysitter leave a child unattended. So he kinda has a reason not to trust her. \n\nBut not OP's circus", "That scenario is rather specific and I need to know if its real?", "Right, I was thinking that too", "Talking about reading when op clearly told her that if she had a problem she could cal her man and get it sorted. The gf did not call him that\u2019s on her", "Personally, I did read it, I ignored it because its not the problem here.  The problem is unannounced girlfriend coming in and starting trouble. I empathise with not wanting trouble in front of the kid, but it in no way makes the babysitter an AH for her actions", "agreed - OP we need an update!", "OP sent a screenshot", "It is. [An astronaut drove 900 miles](https://www.biography.com/musicians/lisa-nowak-lucy-in-the-sky) wearing a diaper and maced her ex\u2019s gf in her car", "holy fucking shit, the point of the comment is that OP unnecessarily escalated and was uncooperative just so she could get paid 10 euro. This is AITA, not \u201cwho started it.\u201d", "Where??", "Bruh I think you have reading problems, because OP said to do exactly that (contact the bf and verify). Crazy gf didn\u2019t listen. You\u2019re turning into an asshole because you can\u2019t convey your thoughts well", "No she didn\u2019t escalate shit. This girl randomly comes says she wants to steal her man and to leave when op never got permission to let the kid with her. The gf can call her own bf herself if that\u2019s such a problem it\u2019s not in op to satisfy someone clearly unhinged", "You would've been a major asshole had you left a child in your care unsupervised with a stranger\n\nNTA", "NTA. But I would like to know what your mother and sister suggested that you do with the child in this situation? Leave them with somebody who is a complete stranger to you, and abandon your responsibility as a babysitter entrusted by the parent?", "NTA.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and in fact I think it was good to not leave as you hadnt gotten permission from the person who employed you to watch the child.\n\nHad you just left at the GFs insistence, and something happened to the child you would not only have felt bad but might've been at least partially at fault for leaving without permission.\n\nIf the GF were available the entire time it makes me wonder why she wasnt asked in the first place and that something might be going on there and he just made up some story to satisfy the GF and then she showed up unannounced when she knew her BF wouldnt be home.", "NTA. You were right to not leave his child with a non-parent. She had no standing to ask you to leave. Sounds like he doesn\u2019t trust her to keep his child.", "You definitely should have left when she asked you. And then when the police show up and ask what happened, you would not have been blamed at all for leaving the child with a psycho. Nope, you obeyed the sisterhood code, girlfriend trumps babysitter. \n\n/s\n\nNTA\n\nIf you leave your child with me, ONLY YOU get to pick up your child. Unless you tell me (and confirm with a picture) who else is allowed to pick up your kid. \n\nActually, I won't even open the door to anyone unless the parent squares it away with me before hand. I'm not taking any risks. \n\nI've watched too many LMN movies too fall for that!", "YTA.  You should have CALLED friend IMMEDIATELY, or had the girlfriend CALL him IMMEDIATELY to sort the issue out.\n\nYou make it sound like the money was the only reason for which you were staying, NOT to help your friend.", "They said that since it was his gf, I could\u2019ve trusted her to look after the kid.", "It wouldn't change the answer. Unless she's the one paying.", "But I didn\u2019t even let her in, the door was unlocked so she entered the house", "That dude is no friend. He should not be ignoring her texts after that ordeal.", "NTA. If I were OP, I would distance myself from him. He never apologized to OP, left her on read and I find that so not acceptable. His gf is definitely insecure and an ah, but so is the dude.", "Yeah and she just bailed anyway after op wouldn\u2019t. You make point, if she was really that suspicious of her bf, and thought op was involved with him, she could\u2019ve abandoned the kid just to try and make op look bad. Which is an absolutely insane thing to do, but some people really are that crazy. OP was paid to take care of a child, some crazy gf having a meltdown doesn\u2019t change that.", "Obviously your friend didn't trust her to watch his kid, so why should you?", "In the future, it would be wise to lock the door, unless the parent specifically doesn't want you to for some reason.", "Completely agree with u/pizzzzaa. If he wanted her to watch the kid he would have asked her, instead of paying someone else. If something happened to the child when they should\u2019ve been in your care, then you would never forgive yourself, nor would the the father. Not to mention the fact the police would be at your door. You did the right thing by not leaving. Also don\u2019t work for them again.", "Or maybe it's a new relationship and he doesn't want his kid to get too attached to someone that he's still in the early stages of dating, or doesn't want the new girlfriend to feel like a babysitter and not a partner.", "I wish SO BADLY I liked being single. I absolutely hate it. I've tried to like it but no matter what I do, I can't. I've had to accept that its just the way I am and I just downplay it to other people so no one thinks I'm desperate and weird. I'm incredibly jealous.", "NTA and it's so surprising a parent (your mother, not sure if your sister has kids) would give the advice to leave a kid without the parents permission. Unless the person who hired you gives you the okay, it is just common sense to not leave them with anyone else?\n\nAlso, I'd distance myself from that friend. No one needs that kind of drama in their life.", "NTA You can't abandon a child to the care of someone else without the express permission of the parent. PERIOD.", " >She said that nobody accept to look over somebody else\u2019s kid only to get paid. \nThere's literally an entire industry based on doing exactly this lmao\n\n\nIt would have been extremely irresponsible of you to leave the child you were in charge of caring for. You have no way of knowing if she is a safe person to leave him with or even if she would have stayed, for all you know she might have left him alone. Wanting to avoid drama will never be a good excuse for child endangerment.", "She literally said she was just there to get paid, nothing more.", "If your friend trusted her, he would have left the child with her in the first place", "Although BF could be completely innocent, it's entirely possible that there's some history here that makes GF think he's going to try it on with the babysitter, like she used to be the babysitter.", "NTA. He clearly doesn\u2019t trust her and/or she\u2019s such garbage she just won\u2019t help him with his son. She just expected you to leave a four year old unsupervised?? The fact that he\u2019s siding with her says a lot about him and that you definitely don\u2019t need him as a friend. \n\nNot to mention- daycares and nannies literally exist to watch children & get paid", "Thank you for this comment. I'm having an off day but for some reason this really made me laugh. \ud83d\ude02"]}
