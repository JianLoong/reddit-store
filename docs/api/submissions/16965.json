But ask why the girlfriend can't be trusted with childcare. The relationship could just be too young to trust her sharing this kind of responsibility.", "Helll no you should not have left the child in that womans care. If i paid u and find out u left my kid with someone i didnt ask to babysit id have thrown u under the bus as a bad friend. You have no idea why he never asked gf to babysit. Maybe the relationship isnt at that level yet. You would have seriously broken my trust in that case. But i would reach out to dude and be like wtf. He may not even know shes meddling.

Plus, the kid was entrusted to your care and you were fulfilling your part of the deal. If the boyfriend called and said you could go and the GF would watch the kid, that's different, but that's not what happened here.\n\nNTA", "NTA the boyfriend left you in charge of his child for a reason. What did the boyfriend say when he got home?", "Nta never abandon your post for unrelated persons and their temper tantrums. Her being unstable in thay situation could very well be an indicator of why she wasn't babaysitting.", "NTA because she didn\u2019t hire you, she\u2019s not paying you, and that\u2019s not her kid. You entered an agreement with your friend who trusted you. What gives the gf the power to dismiss you? Good on you for not leaving the kid. You were there for him.", "Yeah, that relationship isn't going to last long and you don't want to be anywhere close enough to be a scapegoat when it ends, OP. \n\nNTA.", "Yep. In my reply I pointed out if something happened to the child if she had left the girlfriend could have denied even being there. Making it look like she abandoned the child with no sitter. \n\nThere's a reason the gf didn't call the bf while there. She knew what she was doing. Not saying she was trying to endanger the child but she knew she was making a huge deal about nothing.", "This 1000%.", "Because the GF doesn't sound stable enough to watch a house plant.", "Honestly I doubt the boyfriend agrees with her. I think she just said that to be like, 'SEE YOU'RE WRONG.' Clearly OP just learned *why* the boyfriend lied to his girlfriend about who was actually babysitting his son. Yikes on bikes.", "Hell, I doubt he even agreed with her, she probably just said that just to say it. OP your NTA. Girl, get that money.", "I agree with all that you said.  Perhaps he asked the gf, and she declined? Maybe he doesn't trust her with his kid. Regardless, OP  had a job to do and she did it. NTA.", "It was actually Mrs. Lovejoy that usually said it, but still applies.", "Absolutely agree on this! The only person who removes a child from my care is the person who put that child in my care in the first place. The only exception to this is if, for example at my church nursery, Dad drops off the kid and Mom comes to pick them up. However, in those cases I know all the parents/guardians and I can easily call or text the other parties if needed.", ">You would have been an AH if you had left when she asked.\n\nExactly.", "100%. I would be really unhappy if someone I had hired just took someone else at their word and gave them my child. OP did the right thing for sure. Boyfriend needs to sort himself out so he\u2019s not putting innocents in the middle of his drama.", "[removed]", "Has she never met a teenager looking for an after school job? \n\nNTA.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
