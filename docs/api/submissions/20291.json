Age has privileges. 2. Rules are meant to shape kids. She has a different \"shape\" than the other kids. 3. Don't negotiate with terrorists, especially 10-year-old ones.", "NTA. You are an excellent stepmother, every stepchild should be so lucky! I think  it might be easier to speak in terms of age. \"When you turn 15 you'll be able to make some of your own decisions.\"  And maybe be honest with the 10 yr old by saying the 15 yr old had a much harder start in life so you make certain allowances for her, and doesn't the 10yr old agree the family should do that for her.", "OMG even if she\u2019d had a lovely childhood, she\u2019s 5 years older! Of course the rules are different for her. Rivalry is a relationship killer and your husband is feeding that. You all need to get on the same page - first you and your husband, and then you two present a united front with all your kids. \n\nIf one of your kids had cancer and had to get chemo, would the kids want to get to skip school because the kid with cancer got to? Your oldest is IN RECOVERY FROM TRAUMA. There are age-appropriate ways to explain that. A family session with her therapist (with your daughter\u2019s permission) might be helpful- or a session with you and your oldest with her therapist to plan the discussion with the youngers.\n\nYou sound like a stellar stepmom \u2764\ufe0f", "Please don't traumatize a child further under the guise of \"fairness\". \n\nTeacher your younger kids empathy. Ask them to imagine their entire life changing and being ripped out of one situation and put into another. Then ask them if they thought being able to keep a habit/ routines would help them feel safe in their new environment. \n\nExplain to your son that different children require different expectations and as he gets older, his needs may change from his other siblings and that would be addressed, just like it has been for his older sister. \n\nBut do not let him weaponize his sister's trauma to control the household.", "I feel this is above reddits pay grade.\nI get both perspectives, but should probably talk with the therapist about what she thinks", "I do agree she needs special emotional care. Are her chores and homework getting done and done to the best of her abilities?  If yes, then she's doing ok. With the younger ones, they need structure. Mine is 10 and I make her do homework right when she gets home from school(if she even has any) while school is still fresh in her mind. This COULD be an opportunity to give the younger ones a little more freedom and independence though, on a trial basis. Maybe if they get everything done, they can get an extra 30 minutes screen time each. It could motivate them to do more and not be told to do things. But if your step daughter's life with her mother really is that bad, her decompression time sounds important to her. I have depression, PTSD, and high anxiety, so I need to decompress when I can, also. It's just not when I want because\ud83e\udd37 mom life\ud83e\udd37 work life, lol", "I'm adopted. My older sister growing up, also adopted, was born with fetal alcohol effect (milder than syndrome). At home, there was a behaviour double standard. Even tho I was younger, there were standards I was held to that she wasn't. I could see the double standard in action, but I didn't find out why it existed until I was 18 or 20.\n\nAs a kid, this did not seem fair. But I coped. And OP, your kids likely even know some of what your eldest has been through, so unlike me, they'll have a reason to help them understand.\n\nSo I think that your younger kids are just testing the boundaries, as kids will. I think you're right and your husband is wrong. Push back on the younger kids. \"15yo gets to do that because that's what she needs, right now. You don't need it, so sit your butt down here and eat!\"\n\nThey'll get over it. NTA.", "I don't want to say you're an AH because you're trying to make your stepdaughter feel safe and accommodate her needs.\n\n**But** your husband is correct, you do have to change things up now that your own kids have noticed the disparity in rules.  You **do** have to either get stricture with your stepdaughter or mor lenient with own children. If you don't things are going to go downhill fast with your children and they will begin to resent your stepdaughter, *may* start to get nasty and mean towards her. \n\nYes you can sit them down and explain to them that your stepdaughter needs different treatment - but at that age can they truly understand that and it probably won't stop the resentment anyway", "NTA, and sd is so lucky to have you. You can absolutely expect your other children to begin learning why this is acceptable.", "INFO: Have you considered having your other kids in therapy as a safe place to process their emotions?\n\nIt\u2019s not wrong she has different rules. But it would be damn hard for young kids to understand why your mom \u201cloves\u201d her more\u2026which is what they think without help.", "NTA - You are doing the best thing for all kids right now and helping each child get what they need to be successful. \n\nI used to teach 10 year old students and it\u2019s a great age to introduce the concept of fair vs. equal. I\u2019m sure your local library would have some great resources for the topic that would be age appropriate for your child. Sadly I can\u2019t remember the name of the book we had in the classroom.", "NTA.\n\n**THANK YOU** for being the rock your step daughter needs.", "No judgement because you're doing your best in hard circumstances, but I think you need to loosen up a bit on the young ones if you don't want them to hate you and their half sister.\n\nYou're already probably stricter than most parents. Combine that with having someone in the house that doesn't have these rules and I can understand why the kids are upset.\n\nNot saying remove all rules, just loosen up a bit.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing great. But you\u2019ve arrived at a kind of unavoidable situation, because your 10yo is at the point where so many kids start to develop a sense of justice and needing things to feel fair. They\u2019re just awful at identifying what\u2019s fair! It\u2019s time to start explaining that the real rule in your house is \u201cwe give each kid what they need.\u201d Medicine can be a good starting point \u2014 most kids can easily understand that you don\u2019t give medication to everyone equally, you give it to people who need it. There\u2019s a good comic that shows the difference between equality and equity. It\u2019s got three kids looking over a fence at a baseball game and only one is tall enough to see. In one frame they\u2019ve each got one crate. The tall kid doesn\u2019t need it, the middle kid can see, but the shortest still can\u2019t. In the final frame, the tall one has given his crate to the shortest, and they can all see over the fence.", "NTA, fair isn\u2019t equal and they\u2019re much younger, age comes with different rules and privileges and once they have enough trauma to need weekly therapy maybe then they can complain", "NTA,\n\nDifficult situation. Don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s an ahole in this situation. Everyone\u2019s reasoning is completely valid. Agree with your husband though. Your kids are old enough to notice the difference in treatment. Last thing you want is for them to resent you guys. But you also need to treat your daughter carefully given her past. Might be some trial and error for a bit. Possibly testing our how she reacts to more rules. Also might be necessary to talk more with your kids to see if you can help them understand the situation better and show empathy. The ages of the kids makes this difficult though. But hopefully they react well", "Have you tried having a sit down discussion with the children. Are they aware that the sister is in therapy and needs extra support. To help making things fair, maybe having a more leniency with the younger ones. If you continue the way you are, the younger children will only grow more resentful towards their older sibling. It's really hard but maybe a soft yta. Only because your actions will cause discourse and resentment between the siblings.", "You gotta tell the younger kids that older kid is \u201cdifferent\u201d and they\u2019re at the age where they\u2019ll get it. Or else the unequal treatment becomes too apparent. Basically you gotta explain the whole equities concept and why she needs to get different treatment. If you keep just explaining nothing and doing things differently and expecting your kids to understand with zero reason for why then you would be the asshole.\n\nThe kids know she hasn't been there the whole time, so they already intuitively will understand that her life has been different and thus presumably you can encourage them to understand how it's been harder. Regardless, at some point, you will likely have to integrate her into the family structure. I agree maybe a year isn't quite enough yet given what she presumably went through, but you should start to think it through. Presumably you have these rules for the kids for a reason, as you think it's better for their development. Presumably all of that should apply to the older kid as well, even if you want to be slower in introducing those sort of expectations.\n\nYour husband is not incorrect for recognizing that at some point, she will have been there long enough that the differentiated treatment is harder to justify on a longer term basis. At such point, if you just continue it indefinitely and continue a differentiated parenting approach then YTA through a lens of pity, which will likely hurt her in the long run.", "The way you do it, yes YTA\n\nGet to family therapy if you want to be trauma conscious, because little kids don't inherently understand why you treat one of them differently. All you teach them atm is that rules are arbitrary and applied whimsically, so they might as well ignore them and do what they want.", "YTA. You are just going to make the younger children rebel and severely resent their sister.\nAnd FYI all children should have a chance to relax after school before doing homework. \nI can imagine you complaining in a few years that your younger children refuse to have anything to do with their older sister and it will be because your actions have made them resent her.", "I'm leaning toward NAH, but this is a bigger discussion.\n\nHow much of her life, before living with you, do the younger three know about? \n\nI understand if you are trying to give her privacy and no one wants to be pitied, especially by family... but it sounds like the younger three don't understand why their sister is receiving different treatment. Children understand a lot more than people give them credit for- but they need to have the chance.\n\n*\"She went through hell and really needs the extra help. They don\u2019t.\"*\n\nThe kid's balking at your rules now is a clear sign that they need extra help too. Help them understand, but also listen to what they are saying about why they think these rules are unfair to them - beyond the fact that they see their older sister not following them and it's not fair.\n\nThere may be a happy medium between keeping to the same structure and being more lenient to the younger kids and bringing a slightly more strict structure to your stepdaughter. Perhaps speak with a counselor or therapist to help navigate the discussion on both ends and find a system that can work for everyone. None of this is going to be easy by any means. You're in for a rough road for the foreseeable future and not everyone is going to be happy with every decision being made, but do your best to take ***everyone's*** needs - not just one persons into consideration as you and your family move forward.\n\nBest of luck.", "nta but you really should be working toward getting the eldest able to function in a family ergo in society. she's not gonna get a pass irl for some bs she had to go through when she was a kid and more than a year in you are doing her no real favors enabling her now. get that child integrated into family life with all the typical rules and restrictions a good parent would be placing on a child that age. not all at once ofc but steps need to begin. as to the younger children, it's a learning opportunity about caring for others in need. it's up to you to show them how to do that. you don't want her to always feel weak and hurt do you? show her how to be strong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You COULD apply the same rules to everyone \u2014 that would be equal across the board.

For example, I imagine the 10 year-old is allowed to stay up later, and may have slightly different tv privileges (in terms of what they\u2019re allowed to watch, if not how much).

And \"age\" is never a good reason (even though it can be a correct one).  \n\n\nThis WILL give issues among your kids even though you are definitely correct in what you are doing. So maybe talk to a professional about how to handle this situation?", "\ud83d\ude02", "I agree with your 2nd point but the first one is someone odd since she babys the older daughter more than the others. She expects the 6-10 yr old to figure out their own food if they don\u2018t like what\u2019s offered but cooks specifically for the other daughter. Which is fine and necessary but nothing to do with age has privileges.", "How lmfao? OP is doing a great job!! And as others have said, rules are meant to shape the kid. The 15 yo\u2019s situation and needs are different from her other kids, as well as her being older, so the rules would be different anyway. The younger kids are just being slightly annoying younger kids, who do this type of thing. I\u2019m sure if OP explains each time that she\u2019s 15 and has different needs to them, they\u2019ll just accept it. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a huge deal and they\u2019re suffering greatly from an unfair tragedy. They\u2019re kids, they\u2019ll move on", "Love this so much. Such good suggestions\n\nNTA. In fact you sound like a pretty special parent. Keep it up :-)", "This is the way. \n\nNTA.", "That image always comes into my head when someone screams something isn\u2019t fair in a situation like OPs", "> That kid went through hell before we got custody\n\nThat could mean a whole array of different situations. Could be a hyperbole, or could have been an abusive situation or somewhere in-between. If it was an abusive situation, need to talk with a professional. I agree about making things equal, but don\u2019t want to trigger something", "i'm sure i'm getting down-voted for being harsh and mean but life is harsh and mean. we all have to find a way to manage that ugly truth. it is your responsibility as a parent to prepare her for that. maybe it's time to let her suffer some consequences. better now when it won't totally ruin her life. and, just so you know, i am speaking from actual and observational experience. the same experience she is having right now. i would be open to discussing that in DM. just don't let all these well-meaning folks who say she needs petting, coddling, time or anything else that doesn't help her to seriously recover from her trauma. just \"sweet baby\"ing her indefinitely really is not the way.", "What? That\u2019s why ur wrong. It shouldn\u2019t be equal!! She\u2019s 15 and has different needs because of her age and what\u2019s she\u2019s had to deal with. She\u2019s obviously dealt with disordered eating, as well as other things and therefore making things \u2018fair\u2019 would be ridiculous! Why would u make things equal and traumatise her just to please young kids, who will get over it and move on?", "She\u2019s actually preparing her stepdaughter  for that, by giving her a place where she can be safe and loved. The stepdaughter is 15 and has clearly gone thru some very traumatic things, what she needs to do is heal. That is the real world. Home should be a place where you can recharge and feel safe and loved, where she can find peace. The step daughter being able to find that at home, will give her the reserve to do that outside. \n\nIf she\u2019s constantly being tested at home and working to handle that, she\u2019s going to have less capacity for things outside the home. This advice is so stupid because the stepdaughter has already found out that life is harsh. She knows first hand and she had to survive that reality. She\u2019s in therapy, she\u2019s doing her best to function, let\u2019s support that vs. trying to mimic some stupid cruelty. \n\nPeople always say life is harsh. LIKE WE ALL KNOW. People will find out. Your parents don\u2019t need to be the people that teach you that.", "Yta", "NAH\n\nBut you are isolating her from your other kids. They resent her and will start acting out towards her. Right now, they see that you love her and hate them. And those feelings are valid.", "NTA- I would ask her therapist if your rules are working or if you should be enforcing more family time aka eating together more. Also family therapy may be helpful too- this way your younger children can learn how family members support others even when it makes it harder for themselves temporarily", "Even without the issues your SD has faced... it's also very standard for a 15 year old to have more privileges and freedom than a six year old.  With that said, I do think that you need to get that your younger ones are naturally going to resent this new interloper who doesn't have to obey the same rules as they do, and maybe consider also letting them be a bit more relaxed.  If homework and chores are getting done, does it really matter if they are getting done first thing or if the kids get to veg out in front of the TV for half an hour? \n\nNAH", "NAH that said I do think some lenience is needed. Perhaps thursdays are \u201ceat where you want\u201d days", "I lurked a bit in the comments, and I also think you are NTA, but you have a very parenting mindset. \n\nI am a middle child and I grew up with the you cant do this because youre too young and my sibling was 3 years older, but I had to be responsible because I was 5 years older than my younger sibling. I have a lot of resentment, because I thought it was just so unfair that I wasn't able to do anything. I basically had to act like the oldest sibling but without the freedom, but I do see my parents perspective due to the age differences. \n\nI don't think you should let your kids do whatever, but I think you should try to understand where they are coming from instead of be like they are just holding another tantrum. You should try to talk to them, before they think you favor your oldest. If the dad already thinks so, you don't your own kids will? They might already do, hence they act like that.", "NTA. \n\nLife is fair because it\u2019s unfair to everyone. You\u2019re not trying to make everything equal, you\u2019re trying to do right by all your kids. That means that 15 has slightly different rules, and that\u2019s perfectly okay. \n\nYour 10 year old is seeing (what they perceive to be) injustice and therefore feels they must point it out. Personally, I think it\u2019s the god-given right of every tween to say \u2018but it\u2019s not faaaaiiiirrrrr\u2019 a few times a week, if only to torment their parents. But in this case, you are being fair. It might be worth talking to 10 about trauma, and why 15 is getting different treatment. You never know, 10 might be more emotionally insightful than you expect them to be. \n\nRegardless of what you do, you\u2019re doing your best for a traumatised kid and you deserve an enormous pat on the back.", "This right here best response I've seen on Reddit in months 3. Don't negotiate with terrorists, especially 10-year-old ones.", "u/sd-rules\n\nIf you read one response, please let it be this and it's parent comment.", "Right funny my mom always made something extra for me and my sisters and now my niece if we didn't like what she cooked for dinner.", ">not all at once ofc but steps need to begin\n\ni'm sure you realize this does not mean a constant testing of the child. i'll assume you just overlooked that. \n\nas to the rest of your reply, i do agree with you. it's just that you (and many others) are not realizing that, as long as she is treated like a victim, she will feel like a victim. it's been more than a year that she's been safe so it's time to get a toe back in the water. she needs to know what survivor feels like. she needs to know her pain shouldn't keep her isolated, outcast. she's only 15. everything is pretty mixed up for all of us at that age. she is making requests for special treatment for legit reasons and any heart who loves her will want to give her that. but her requests are divisive and i'm not talking about the feelings of the younger when i say that. i mean they keep her excluded from normalcy (i really hate that word but i hope you understand my meaning). if someone says they don't want to be with the family and the family just says okay, deep inside that person may start to feel the family doesn't want to be with them either. \"well i guess they don't really want me since they aren't fighting for me\". the thoughts and feelings experienced at that age don't often make sense. sometimes they don't even know what they are thinking. sometimes they can't recognize their own emotions. i'm not saying OP is doing it wrong. i'm saying they are not doing enough but it's not their fault. most of the advice i've read in this thread is really good. but it's not enough. she's the walking dead right now. she needs a little defibrillation. and yes, this phase of her recovery will be the hardest part but it's her best chance at not suffering permanent victim status but, instead, become a survivor and maybe even find a way to help others. a victim will never be able to help anyone else.", "NAH. But I do think you probably should even things up a bit. For example, a 6 year old shouldn\u2019t have to make their own food if they really dislike the meal. Or maybe you could have a designated \u201c30 minutes screen time\u201d before HW once they get home from school because kids do need a break from school sometimes before immediately starting HW. My mom used to let me read for 30 minutes before I had to do it. \n\nI also don\u2019t think that having such a disparity for so many things will be healthy in the long run, and it\u2019ll breed resentment of your step daughter from your other kids and that can last a lifetime.", "NTA. This is a great teaching opportunity about empathy. Your oldest needs more accommodations because she's struggling with mental health issues, whereas your other children are not suffering and just view it as special treatment. You can teach them that helping people struggling is important as human beings, and they should be grateful that they have so many blessings in their lives!", "YTA, but softly.\n\nYou are a great step-parent, and I think you are getting all of those supports right. Keep doing exactly what you are doing for her.\n\nHowever. You are not doing so great by your other kids right now - and they are telling you so. This means your other kids feel something (hurt, resentful, wary, uncertain,  etc.) about the situation, and that is only going to grow unless you change something. You need to talk with them - continually - about different needs and different ages. They are too young for a one-and-done conversation.  They need frequent reminders and reassurance from you. Right now, they see that you favor one and seem to spend a lot of time with her. Take a hard look at that. Are you spending more time with/on her? She needs it, but so do the others. Don't let them become Glass Children. \n\nFamilies change, and that sometimes means letting go of preconceived expectations and rules. Reexamine your expectations for the younger ones. Your husband has already done this, and he thinks some thing(s) can be relaxed.  I think you need to hear him on this. Talk about what that might look like. Consider relaxing some things for the older one(s) or creating a more age-dynamic system that applies to all children.  Do not dismiss your husband on this. He was SD's parent before you were and ultimately needs to guide her integration into your household. Hear him. \n\nNone of this works if you ignore the needs and insights your husband and other children are telling you. Do not let yourself slip into a Me and SD Against the World scenario. That hurts everyone in the household, possibly for a very long time. Some of your language reads like this is where you are headed. So, take a deep breath and look at the landscape around you. Hear your husband and work WITH him for all of the children. Maybe see a therapist yourself and talk through this huge weight you are carrying.  Consider a marriage counselor to help navigate compromise and new expectations.  I doubt this is the only way her custody battle, trauma, and needs have affected the household. \n\nThis is big stuff and you are trying so very hard. But your family is telling you that it isn't always working. Listen, please.", "It\u2019s a dilemma for all parents. I\u2019m mom of three and our middle kid is autism spectrum but very high functioning. The rules were a bit different for him out of necessity. He came at the world in a totally different way than the other two, so the expectations had to be different. And yeah, I heard the \u201cit\u2019s not fair\u201d thing from both the sibs and from him!"]}
