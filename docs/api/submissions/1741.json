The solution is to figure out if that\u2019s something you want to work out or not. If he wants to eat TV dinners and you can afford to buy those instead of cooking, why not do that? There will be fewer dishes to pile up and you won\u2019t be stuck with leftovers. Though he does need to learn to clean in a timely fashion. Dishes washed too late is as good as dishes never washed.

He might feel obligated to say yes he wants it but then he clearly doesn't really want it. Just stop asking, stop cooking for him, stop buying food for him. Make meals for 2 and eat 1 and pack the other up as lunch for yourself for tomorrow.\n\nYou mention how the dishes and clothes are split up, who is doing the other chores?

But he'll probably get upset and just buy them himself. Then what?", "For the specific question of whether you would be the AH for not buying TV dinners? NTA. \n\nHowever, the rest of the issues have been somewhat self induced here. You say you are minimally employed, which has given you the spare time to take up cooking at the pace you are. This means you\u2019ve effectively created space in your schedule for making all the dishes dirty, and not for cleaning them for some reason? Then you wanted to switch chores, which fine, but you\u2019re upset and stressed because he doesn\u2019t clean the kitchen at a pace that keeps up with you dirtying it and doesn\u2019t eat the food you decided to cook as a hobby which he didn\u2019t ask for? \n\nYou can stop buying TV dinners if you want - he\u2019s the one that eats them, he can buy them, but you could also just cook less and let him eat what he wants. Also, he\u2019s the AH for being nearly 30 and dating a 20 year old.\n\nEdit: the person working the least amount of hours should be doing the most chores, they just simply have the most time.

If you two have an agreement and he is not meeting it, one he is not respecting you as he did not address it you did, two your obligation to meet your commitment is negated, and three you need to think is this something you want to deal with in two more years?

Perhaps he never ate the leftovers because he didn't want to feel obligated to  help out more with the extra work load.

It's so much easier to only worry about one or two pots and plates when I've full and relaxed than a plethora of prep dishes as well. Unless you're frying a lot, there's usually some time while things are simmering, boiling, baking when you can wash quite a bit. Then, when cooking's done, if you buy storage containers that are freeze/bake safe, you can dish the meals onto plates and into storage containers as soon as they're done. By the time, you're done eating and washing up the pots and pans, the food is often cool enough to just cover the containers, and pop them in the fridge or freezer. And usually, if you wash the pot/pan right away, it's easier than waiting until after you've eaten and are relaxed, when things have dried and hardened. When it comes to baking, I basically live for parchment paper and foil. It makes clean up sooooooo much easier when my pans are lined  (and/or sprayed--hello muffin pan--to help with overflows/drips).\n\nAlternatively, you can also try putting dishes directly into a sink of soapy water. The need for the sink and the smell that can arise if one doesn't clear it quickly might help to make sure they get washed more quickly, no matter who's on dish duty, but that's hit or miss.
