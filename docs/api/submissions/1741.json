The solution is to figure out if that\u2019s something you want to work out or not. If he wants to eat TV dinners and you can afford to buy those instead of cooking, why not do that? There will be fewer dishes to pile up and you won\u2019t be stuck with leftovers. Though he does need to learn to clean in a timely fashion. Dishes washed too late is as good as dishes never washed.

He might feel obligated to say yes he wants it but then he clearly doesn't really want it. Just stop asking, stop cooking for him, stop buying food for him. Make meals for 2 and eat 1 and pack the other up as lunch for yourself for tomorrow.\n\nYou mention how the dishes and clothes are split up, who is doing the other chores?

But he'll probably get upset and just buy them himself. Then what?", "For the specific question of whether you would be the AH for not buying TV dinners? NTA. \n\nHowever, the rest of the issues have been somewhat self induced here. You say you are minimally employed, which has given you the spare time to take up cooking at the pace you are. This means you\u2019ve effectively created space in your schedule for making all the dishes dirty, and not for cleaning them for some reason? Then you wanted to switch chores, which fine, but you\u2019re upset and stressed because he doesn\u2019t clean the kitchen at a pace that keeps up with you dirtying it and doesn\u2019t eat the food you decided to cook as a hobby which he didn\u2019t ask for? \n\nYou can stop buying TV dinners if you want - he\u2019s the one that eats them, he can buy them, but you could also just cook less and let him eat what he wants. Also, he\u2019s the AH for being nearly 30 and dating a 20 year old.\n\nEdit: the person working the least amount of hours should be doing the most chores, they just simply have the most time.

If you two have an agreement and he is not meeting it, one he is not respecting you as he did not address it you did, two your obligation to meet your commitment is negated, and three you need to think is this something you want to deal with in two more years?

Perhaps he never ate the leftovers because he didn't want to feel obligated to  help out more with the extra work load.

You deserve better.", "The dishes and food are two different issues tbh. NAH, you two just need to have a proper talk about day-to-day expectations, comfort levels, and general concerns. Your partner not helping with cleaning up is an issue that he really needs to step up and solve, but the food thing is not his fault. You know he doesn't eat the leftovers you leave, so why are you still making them when you know it's not gonna work out the way you hope? If microwave dinners work for him, that's fine, less dishes to wash up that way, and you can just focus on nourishing yourself.", "I love anothers comment\n\n|Info: Why don't you just make enough food for yourself and let him eat his tv dinners? If the only thing he wants to eat is those and the only dish he will generate is a fork, why swim against the stream?|\n\nI would only add 6that your should only shop for your self so stop buying him food.

Cook only for yourself and do your dishes. Let him figure it out.", "I'm someone who doesn't like left overs but what I do is portion, I've learned how much I can actually consume and I make that much.

Go back to him doing laundry. \n\nI don\u2019t really think he has to eat your food or clean up your food mess. He should probably be adult enough to tell you to just stop making him food though.", "Don't do his clothes and don't wash his dishes. Everyone pick up after themselves. If the only dishes he makes are forks while every time you eat it's got to be a production I get it.", "NTA but wow, if I understood correctly, your fianc\u00e9 is really bad for your mental health. Are you sure you want to marry this guy? Does he make any part of your life better?", "NTA but face reality. This man is grown, hes set in his ways. You need to make peace with that and adapt yourself to it. I saw your comments about your very small portion sizes and I understand that but you need to adjust until you figure out how to cook for yourself. Don't worry about him. Tell him he can do laundry again, wash the dishes that you create when you cook for yourself.", "It sounds like OP is generating all the dishes by making excessive food he won't eat and that just stresses her out further. I think she needs to cook way smaller serving sizes and give back the laundry if he isn't cleaning the dishes. But, I wouldn't expect someone who for instance just worked 3-12 hour shifts in a row and who just comes home to nuke a dinner to then have time/energy to clean dishes for food he didn't eat/doesn't want.

Why can\u2019t you open up to him and tell him that enough is enough? Why haven\u2019t you told him that the deal is pretty much moot because he hasn\u2019t been keeping his end of the deal? Why are you still believing in his \u201cyes\u201d when he has repeatedly shown you it is in actuality a \u201chell no\u201d?
