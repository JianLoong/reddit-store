Ever since my little brother (16m) was born, I was the \"forgotten child\". For context, I am the middle child. \n\nI have been working since the time i turned 16, as I was always expected to support myself, and if they had to pay for it, I had to pay them back. Even food, clothes, water, etc. Aka, the bare minimum of raising a child. So, I have worked and earned money to pay for all my own things. I got myself a new bed, dresser, night stand, clothes, TV, and anything and everything else you could imagine I might need to make my bedroom my own. I know the tv was not a need, but I had plenty set aside for it, and since i was not allowed to use theirs, I got my own to have entertainment when I am home and have nothing to do. Well, a few weeks ago, my mother told me to make sure i keep my job, so she can be secure knowing if they run out of money, they have more to tap into.\n\nWhen she made mention of needing me to hold my job down so she could be secure about money, I asked her why she said that. And she explained \"well if you're working and are making money, and expenses climb too high, I know we have extra money to buy the things we need.\" I asked her what she meant by extra money, and her response set me off.\n\n\"Well, you're working and earning money while living under MY roof, which means you'll be giving us what we need when we need it.\" In other words, my money was not my own, and simply her \"extra\" money for rainy days. I immediately went on a rage about how my money is not hers to spend, I earned it by spending my hours and energy working so that I could provide for myself as I was always expected to do. I may be living under your roof, but you do not pay for me. I pay for myself. The expenses you say are climbing too high is on you, considering you're always ordering more and more things online, and still going out to eat or ordering food to be picked up, despite trying to forbid me from doing so.\n\nWe fought for over an hour before I screamed at her to stop, my money is my own, and that was that. I told her she is not entitled to my things or my money just because she is my biological mother. She does not work, and expects my father to bring in all the money that they need to support herself, my father, and their growing 16 year old son, who I also help provide for, as he is my little brother and I love him. \n\nMy fiance believes me to be in the right for putting my foot down(as she heard a good chunk of the fight) but my father and the rest of my family believes me to be the asshole for telling my mother my money is not hers to use. I basically cut ties with my sister after a fight on new years(long story), but she told my parents I was an asshole for being greedy about my money. Most of my family has stopped talking to me, and it has me wondering, am I the asshole for telling my mother she is not entitled to my money?\n\nEdit: (sorry for leaving this out) I pay $250 every month for rent to them for utilities, but aside from this, I buy my own groceries and needs, they do not provide anything for me.\n\nEdit 2: I only pay $250 because that was what was discussed as my rent in December. When she told me about more money, my father was not part of the decision about raising rent or providing more. I am easy when it comes to expenses as i understand economy these days is risky. But she did not discuss anything with anyone.", "created_utc": 1677046764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118qu61/aita_for_telling_my_mother_she_cannot_use_my_money/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even though you cover your own expenses, you are living in a shared household and I imagine your parents might still cover a chunk of your costs... Do you contribute to the rent/mortgage or utilities? Do you share vehicles or insurance costs? Do they cover you on their medical plan? Stuff like that. I feel like as a working adult, you should be aware of what all goes into supporting yourself because it's not just about room furnishings and clothes.\n\nIf your mom needed your help financially, she should have approached the subject with you better. And in my opinion, I do think that's a valid discussion for you both to have. \nIf your help is needed to cover the costs in the home, you could establish some sort of amount to give your parents every month.

If your parents feel like they want to raise your rent to something closer to market rent for your area, then that's their prerogative. In my area a studio apartment rents for around $2,400 per month. Hopefully you live somewhere more affordable.\n\n\nYou're 21, an adult, working a full-time job. If you don't like how you are being treated, then move out.

Shes also the asshole for telling you taht she can just take random amounts of money from you as needed. Thatnot how adult life works.\n\nNow that you are 21 and living in her house, she has a right to charge you rent.She can set the amount of rent, and if you dont agree with it you can leave and move out on your own as you are an adult.\n\nYou're the asshole for thinking $250 even covers half of the expense your mom has to pay for you to live there. $250 dollars, unless you live in a very cheap area in a foreign country, doesnt pay for anywhere close to what you cost your mom.

You're not even paying for yourself my friend... \n\nAsking you to pay your own food and clothing before you were 18 was trash..  but given your maths skills I'm going to ask... Did they not provide you meals or did they not provide you with the food you wanted? Did they not provide you clothing? Or did you have to work for the clothing you wanted? Did they not provide you those basics? Or did they just provide you with basics you didn't want... And things you wanted needed to be earned as you didn't like the basics. If you were paying for basics and not just the things you wanted, ESH. (I have my doubts because... See below)\n\nBut if you do not expect to \"help your family\" as they have helped you this entire time... (You only started paying rent in December and are 21 years old so I'm not sure how your family was making you pay for your basics at age 16)... Than you should move out... To your own home... Where you can take your furniture that you paid for and your clothing and your groceries etc... And then you can pay to furnish your own kitchen... And with 250 a month as your budget you won't need to worry about living room furniture because you will not have one. And with a 250 budget you won't have much of a kitchen or bath... So furnishing both of those should be minimal. \n\nDoes your fiance live with you too? Or was your fiance just there to hear this fight. \n\nAs for having to purchase your own clothing and furniture... Past age 18 that's kind of what happens. Hopefully your parents help out.. but your parents gave you free lodging and free utilities for two years so *shrug*.... you mention you bought NEW things with you money, not that you didn't have those things at all (besides the tv).. Apparently they gave you 3k of savings according to your current rental structure that only just began two months ago. \n\n(Which is what brings me back to the question of did you really not have basics? Or did you just have to work for the things you wanted... Because your family made you support yourself at age sixteen but you only started to 'pay rent' this December at age 21...
