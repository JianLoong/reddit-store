Your paternal grandparents are to a certain degree tho. Let me clarify, I don\u2019t believe that they have ANY obligation to your half siblings - bcz they don\u2019t. But, there is no reason for them to be ugly about it either. Your mom is wrong if she EXPECTS them (or anyone for that matter) to buy her children,or herself, gifts.

We\u2019ve always celebrated with \u201cfamily by choice\u201d because we didn\u2019t have actual family who wanted to get together for the holidays. The people we always spent thanksgiving and Christmas with are the family of our parent\u2019s best friends from college, rather than anyone we\u2019re related to. Over the years, we\u2019ve had plenty of other people join us: other friends, students we know who don\u2019t live locally, distantly connected in-laws, etc. \n\nMy dad\u2019s family, who was so anti social no one wanted to host so we\u2019d gather in a bowling alley every year, still never had any objections to other people celebrating with us. \n\nYour mom is your mom. Your half siblings are your half siblings. I just can\u2019t believe they\u2019re not invited to the party with you. Sure, technically they\u2019re not related by blood, but saying there\u2019s no relation is just ridiculous to me. \n\nIDK I\u2019m obviously going against the grain here, but the whole thing just strikes me a sad and miserly. \n\nI think you should all get together and watch A Christmas Carol this year. Maybe get visited by some spirits. I think you could all use it.", "Info:\nI feel like there is a lot that isn't being said about WHY she had a bad relationship with these people that could make or break the judgment.

We don't know if that's the case or not. \n\nPersonally it wouldn't sit right with me to argue against my younger siblings to at least spend the holidays at a better place, unless I had a poor relationship with them and their mother. Your grandmother's objection is one thing, but since you are related your words will hold a different weight.\n\nUnless there is a good reason for this, but I won't assume unless you tell us more info.", "I feel bad for your mom.

From my personal POV, I had grandparents from my biological father who loved my little brother even though he wasn't their grandchild and always accepted him. This is a different situation though because I was raised by my brother's father (who is legally my father now) but my bio dad's family has always been in the picture even though he didn't care to be. So, (sorry for the backstory), I do think it's a bit cruel to ostracize other children when they don't have a Christmas to look forward to, but it's obviously their decision. My family is the \"everyone's welcome\" type for the most part so I'm biased.", "NTA. However, this is christmas, the whole christmas spirit is about helping others.

Even the big stuff she has chosen not to go with us like my grandparents anniversary. \n\nHer own family, I don't know all the details, but what she told me is she liked her brothers best friend. She found out he liked her too but wanted her brothers okay, which he didn't give because she and her brother fought a lot and did not get along. She was pissed at her brother and never forgave him. Her parents would never take sides but she was so angry when she found out he was going to be best man at his best friends wedding and her parents were going.

They're just some random kids, to the paternal family. They have an established and existing bond with OP, and a remembrance of their immediate family through the OP too. With the half siblings, they don't have a relationship, they just have a reminder that mom was moving on from the person that made her part of their family.\n\nIf they included the half siblings, would they be expected to treat them the same as OP? That's a reasonable expectation and yet they may not have those kinds of feelings. They may not have the resources to welcome extra kids to the same degree. There are all kinds of reasons to not include those kids. The mom is responsible for having two children with a person who doesn't provide for them, but that doesn't give her the right to force the paternal family to put their resources into her kids.", "I agree that it does create a relationship -abit.  Because op's fathers family do love and care for OP - they should, as an extension of their love for OP, welcome the people that he loves to their table.\n\nAnd example of this in my family is that my sister got pregnant when she was just 15.  She and her 15 year old boyfriend, Tom, decided that they wanted to get married.  Because both families were religious and anti-abortion they allowed this when they were 16 and they had my nephew Joe.  Of course, because they were much too young, they dropped out, were always under employed and the marriage failed.  Both went on to have bad relationships with others and a few years latter Tom, who had become an addict by then, had a daughter by a woman of another race who was also a drug addict and both were very poor.   Tom's family were very racist and would never acknowledge Tom's daughter, though they were good to Joe.  Joe loved his little half sister and his fathers family's rejection of her was cause of great distress to him.  So my family out of love for Joe, always invited her along  to our family's celebrations, because Joe was family  we saw that the half-sister he loved was by extension, also family.\n\nOp's fathers family do not have to invite his half-siblings - but it would be good if they did.", "they are total strangers\n\nThe mother has had no contact with deceased husband's family other than to let them pick up her kid - BY HER CHOICE.
