Why would they feel obligated to invite two kids they don't know and aren't related to into their most personal and cherished activities?", "No, you are NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re completely right with this one. Your paternal family have zero obligation to include your half siblings in anything, as they are not related to them.

Yes.  \nDo these kids deserve love and attention and support? Yes - as do all kids.   \nIs your paternal family obligated in any way (even just morally) to take them on as extra grandkids? No.", "You\u2019re not heartless or being dismissive.\n\nYour siblings are from another man who has no ties to your biological father\u2019s family.\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit: Whoops, sorry OP!

She is now projecting it onto you and your paternal grandparents.", "Your mom should be going after her ex for childcare money not after your family. NTA.", "NTA. It is not your paternal families obligation to step into the role of family to two children who are not related to them and were born years after your father passed away.

This perspective will probably help understand her better.", "She was never really involved with my paternal family. Even when dad was alive she'd choose to stay home and let me and my dad go. Or she'd go but was doing something else and not really engaged with them. They always invited her and I remember one time my grandparents celebrated a wedding anniversary and mom didn't come with us. She saw them a bit more after dad died but wasn't more engaged with them at that point either."]}
