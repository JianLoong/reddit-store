Your paternal grandparents are to a certain degree tho. Let me clarify, I don\u2019t believe that they have ANY obligation to your half siblings - bcz they don\u2019t. But, there is no reason for them to be ugly about it either. Your mom is wrong if she EXPECTS them (or anyone for that matter) to buy her children,or herself, gifts.

This is the type of entitlement that alienates people. OP is her child, not her parent, yet she \u201chell-or-high watered\u201d OP by basically forcing her to choose between having a good relationship with her paternal grandparents or receiving kindness from her own mother. Sorry, but this is a selfish move \u2014 you never make your children fight your battles for you, and you don\u2019t ever put them in a situation where they have to choose between you and another family member.

Her mother is a grown person \u2014 the responsibility was on her to build relationships with her family and in-laws. Not only did she not do that, she is attempting to sabotage OP\u2019s relationship with OP\u2019s grandparents simply because she\u2019s not getting what she wants. That\u2019s some entitlement on the part of the mother. It would be one thing if you were pointing the finger at OP\u2019s grandparents, but somehow you chose to overlook both them and the mother to hold a 19 year old responsible for wanting to spend time with her dad\u2019s side of the family? That is not how society works, buddy. We don\u2019t hold children responsible for fixing their parents mistakes.", "How is it ostracizing when these other children have never been a part of OP's paternal family things? They aren't being ostracized anymore than they are by not being welcome at a neighbor's family's house on Christmas.", "From the way OP worded it, he alone is going to his grandparents' for Christmas, and it sounded like he was the only one invited - Mom was likely not invited in the first place. I'd be willing to bet that the moment Mom started dating someone else, they dropped her like a rock. \n\nThere is a lot of info missing or glossed over, though - why did mom go no-contact with the uncle? did he abuse her? did he insult her? did they just not get along? Was the big argument because they wanted to force contact? \n\nI do feel kind of bad for the two other kids, though. Sounds like nobody wants them -  in general, forget about Christmas - including OP.  \n\nYeah, OP is correct and NTA on this issue - his paternal grandparents have no obligation towards the two un-related kids, but the situation still stinks for those two kids all around.", "That's why i was asking. \nThere seem to be a lot of ppl recommending connecting with this family and the rain they're cut off might be important", "This. There is zero evidence OP's mother is the problem here. Cutting off your brother at 17 *only* sounds like abuse that the family condoned (an alarmingly common occurrence.) The relationship with OP's family is described as just \"not super close\", and it's hardly her fault her fiance's family ghosted her.\n\nNone of this adds up to a clear pattern of her being the problem. Obviously she's wrong to try and push kids with zero relationship on OP's paternal family, but the conclusions being drawn here have no real basis.", "eh she\u2019s alienated three going on four family groups, mom is TA.", "I see you in the comment section saying the same thing over and over again. We get it. Mom alienated TWO families: her parents/brother and her late husband\u2019s. She is NOT to blame for her almost-fianc\u00e9s family not wanting anything to do with her or the kids. It\u2019s really fucked up to blame her for alienating that family.", "I see. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve gone through that and for the loss of your Father.

I\u2019m sorry for you and your siblings, you\u2019re all innocent in her drama and it\u2019s too bad that you\u2019ve all had to be victimized by it. I\u2019m glad you have your Dad\u2019s family. It\u2019s heartbreaking that your siblings have no one but her. Having one problematic parent (MY mom) is bad enough when there is another, stabilizing, one (my Dad) in the picture. I can\u2019t imagine being at the mercy of one without the other.", "I agree, there's probably some history with the mom that caused the OP's paternal family to drop the rope.

Mum is certainly not entitled to OP's grandparents, but I don't think this situation necessarily fits the pattern people are ascribing. The situation with her brother sounds very alarming, the relationship with OP's family sounds like a normal eh relationship, and the father of the younger kids running away/his family wanting nothing to do with it doesn't remotely sound like a her problem.", "Well, you can assign them guilt or innocence for not being involved with her but clearly they are not involved. That\u2019s all I meant. Mom has a hand in that whether it\u2019s entirely her or (more likely) a combination of problems.

Also- did that guy not have a family that the kids can lean on at all?", "NTA One of the benefits of being married is financial security for the mother and children, but without marriage your mom could still seek child support.  She needs to file for support from the dad of her two latest children.  And her previous husband\u2019s family is not related to and does not owe anything to her and her two youngest children.  Also, sorry you lost your dad but it\u2019s good his family still includes you.  Be good and loving toward them if they\u2019re good to you.

It's possible to empathize with your mother without getting sucked in (but in practice that's hard to do and I strongly recommend talking to a counselor). You can feel bad about your innocent half-siblings' situation without magically becoming responsible for fixing it. \n\nYour half-siblings' paternal family, especially their father, should be deeply ashamed. They are the reason your half-siblings are experiencing grossly inequitable treatment. The fact that you are cared for and they aren't is rubbed in their faces daily, and they can't escape that because they're children living under a roof with you. Your mother is witnessing this, on top of struggling herself. The fight you described with her own family smacks of abuse, so it's sounding like she's lost 3 families. That's a lot for anyone to deal with.", "NTA Your Mom wants her younger kids to have all the same benefits you receive from your Dads family, but that is stupid because they aren't related and have never built a bond with them. It doesn't sound like your mom ever bonded with your dad's family, so she has no reason to expect your grandparents to accept her other kids. Even she isn't close to her former in laws. I hope she doesn't make the kids resent you for not being included. If you get an inheritance expect everyone to go nuts saying you should share, because it isn't fair you got it and they didn't and it is only fair  you share it.
