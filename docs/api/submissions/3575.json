Do you have  relationship with your maternal relatives? Maybe  you taking a few steps contacting them and exploring whether they are interested in getting to know you and your siblings- you are their grandchildren, nieces, nephews- might be worth attempting.\n\nYou are quite right.

It seems like your mom has had a lot of hardships. I can only imagine what her brother did to her for her to go no contact the majority of her life! Then, eventually have to cut off her parents over said brother. Her husband dies leaving her to raise you alone. She tried to build a family again with a deadbeat. And now she's struggling. \n\nAnd your siblings....\"aren't welcome\"? Why are you ok with that? Yes, it's not your grandparents \"obligation.\" People aren't obligated to help the homeless, care for abandoned animals, or be generous with their neighbors either. But, they do those things out of community and love. Why wouldn't you want to spend the holidays with all of your family? Why aren't you advocating for your family? Why can't everyone come together and have a good time? \n\nIf I was in your grandparents' shoes I would see your mom as my late son's wife and the mother of my grandchild. She would be so welcome in my home. And if she was welcome, any other kids or other lover would be welcome, too. That's family. Not welcoming your half siblings means your mom isn't welcome. How can you not feel that?\n\nThis just feels callous to me.", "Absolutely positively NTA. And you are correct in everything you told her! Your paternal family is not obligated to welcome/support/include children they\u2019re not even related to just be they share the same mother with you!! And your mom seems very entitled to say it\u2019s her right that they be a part of this side of your family. She made bad choices with the father of those children and wants to put the blame and responsibility on your paternal family. Your grandparents are right to not include them and it doesn\u2019t make them heartless or cold! It sucks for your half siblings that their paternal and maternal families want nothing to do with them, but that\u2019s on your mom!", "NTA. Instead of making demands from your paternal family, your mom should look for a lawyer to make sure your half-siblings' father will pay child support.", "NTA. And not your decision. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to expect your late fathers family to have anything to do with the kids your mother had with some deadbeat. \n\nWHY do the surviving parents constantly do this?

Hope your siblings find love, family, and kindness from others in the future.", "I agree..but i do feel paternal family is being a little shitty..they have a right to be. But its not like the 1/2 siblings did anything wrong. Kind of crappy for them to be unincluded all the time. I feel paternal family could be a little more accepting and inclusive to these other children even if they arent related by blood.  Feels vindictive towards the mother and cold towards the kids. But i dont know all the history so i cant call them an AH for it...OP defiantly isnt the AH just in the middle of it", "Right. My brother has a son and his son has older two sisters by his mom who are in their early 30s that we met when they were 5&7, and they are family and welcome at any family event.", "I\u2019m really in two minds about this. I have a stepson - originally related to my family neither by blood nor by socialisation, as you describe it. They took him into their hearts and have a good relationship because he\u2019s family to ME, he wasn\u2019t originally family to them.\n\nHow would I have felt if the first time I wanted to bring him over for Christmas, they had answered \u201cWhy would we feel obligated to invite a kid we don\u2019t know and aren\u2019t related to into our most personal and cherished activities?\u201d\n\nThese children are OPs family. If the paternal family doesn\u2019t care enough about OP to also care about OPs family, for me they are arseholes.\n\nThe judgement is definitely NTA, OP is doing nothing wrong.

She went NC with her brother *only* at 17 which sends off MAJOR warning bells for me. Then, in her adult life cut off her parents as well. She lost her husband. And then got screwed over by her next relationship. People are acting like she's a \"problem\" without knowing anything. And I don't understand how tho OP's half siblings \"aren't welcome.\" I've been more welcoming to complete strangers. It's not the grandparents \"responsibility\"....but, why not show some kindness? This was the woman their dead son made a life with, the woman that raised his child alone, and those are the siblings of their grandchild. That's family in my book.", "When reading the post, this was my take away. The mum atleast from how I saw what OP said seems to have just had a really really shitty go a life.", "She\u2019s fighting with 3 sets of family. They can\u2019t all be wrong and only she\u2019s right. When everyone you meet sucks, most likely the problem is you.", "You took words right out of my mouth. It would be nice if the paternal family \"adopted\" the half siblings, but they are not obligated in anyway. I aslo believe the mother may have burned a lot of bridges with that family, along with many others, and the half sibilings will suffer for it.", "Yep. I come from a \"the more the merrier\" family and at various points we have included family we are related to, chosen family we aren't, friends, family of friends, children of friends, assorted inlaws, neighbors, chosen family of chosen family, exchange students, and a drunken tuba player at our family Christmas. It's terrific, 5 stars, never change. Highly recommend. \n\nBut is one obligated to be that way? No. Not at all.", "She's NC with her *parents* because of an argument. The argument being over her brother who she has been NC with since she was 17.

Or using lots of protection.", "Mom literally put zero effort into any relationship she had with her in laws while husband was alive and even after her death. They were family by law, and when the marriage ended with death, so did any relation mom had with OPs paternal side of the family. They have zero obligation (moral or legal) to welcome OPs half siblings into their family.", "The mother is the common denominator in all those failed relationships. Sometimes people struggle because they\u2019ve created their own messes. Until she takes accountability for her behavior that has alienated everyone around her and stops acting so darn entitled, this is will be her situation. \n\nIt\u2019s not her child\u2019s or the paternal family\u2019s obligation to cater to appease her, now that she\u2019s struggling, when she\u2019s clearly not held up her end of the relationship.", "Care to explain why?", "That's the person she needs to be throwing her anger at.", "Yeah, I feel for those kids, caught in this tug-of-war that is not of their making.\n\nMy guess is that part of the reason the paternal family is acting the way they are is that they fear that if they give in and have the kids this Christmas, the requests will just keep coming. Oh, you\u2019re going to Disney? Take my kids. Oh, you are having a party? Why aren\u2019t my kids invited? How come you didn\u2019t get my kids birthday presents?\n\nI would be tempted to offer the following, because I hate to see kids be hurt\u2014the kids, but not their mom, can come to Christmas dinner. I would provide one $20 gift each, and a filled stocking. The kids can join in all the festivities while they are in my house. They can arrive at 10 am and must be picked up by 6 pm. And if their mom didn\u2019t like one tiny part of the arrangement, the kids would not be coming. And I would only do this if the child who was related to me though it was a good idea.", "Oh please.

If you get in a serious relationship with someone who already has kids, you know that's what you're signing up for, and there's an expectation that those kids will be included in family activities. In this case, the kids arrived years after their son had passed, and it doesn't sound like they were super close to OP's mom. OP doesn't sound like she's super close to her siblings either, which makes sense given the age difference. I feel like if she had asked to include the siblings, they might have, but if she doesn't actively want them there, why would they include them?", "The mother is likely an awful person.
