We live in the suburbs. \n\nA few months ago, a lovely family moved in to the house next door to ours. Our new neighbours (Valentina and Isabel in their early thirties, with their two 3 and 5 year old kids) have been nothing but pleasant. Isabel is a doctor, and Valentina is an architect.\n\nJane really hasn't had any health problems in her life. In fact, she's an athlete and very successful at school. However, since two weeks ago, she's been having seizures. She had 5 seizures in two weeks and despite there being many tests, the doctors are trying to diagnose what the problem is. We are devastated.\n\nEvery time that the seizures happened, (3 times late at night), I called Isabel to help us out. She helped stop the seizures, came with us to the hospital every time and stayed there until everything was taken care of. She's been a tremendous amount of help and she never even frowned about this let alone complain.\n\nMy cousin is a doctor. He lives in a different state but I still called to ask him about Jane. At the end of the conversation, I mentioned Isabel. I told him how wonderful she and Valentina had been to us during this difficult time both emotionally and professionally.\n\nHe went off on me for being an inconsiderate AH to disturb her like that. He said she maybe wouldn't say something to my face but I was being a horrible neighbour. He also said that just because shes a doctor doesnt mean she gets to be called over by neighbours anytime. I told him off and said not all doctors were as self entitled as him and I am glad there are people like Isabel. He is still mad at me.\n\nI told my wife and she said maybe we were being AHs and needed to apologize or do something for them. I don't really know I'm focused on Jane thankfully she's much better these past few days but I would like to know if I am being an AH.", "created_utc": 1685282898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13u1c2u/aita_for_repeatedly_asking_for_help_from_my/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is exactly what emergency services is for.  Your neighbor is not emergency services.  The first time in a panic if emergency services was far away might be okay.  After that, you and your wife should have been taught what to do when she has a seizure.  Find out what your neighbor likes, flowers, plants, wine, cheese, a fantastic dinner out and get her the biggest thing you can afford.  Stop bothering her.", "Yta. Yes, Isabel is a great neighbor, but now you guys are taking advantage of her kindness. What happens if she isn\u2019t a home to help the next time your daughter has a seizure? Also, maybe you should do something nice for Isabel and her family, take them dinner or something", "It's time to come up with a plan of action where you aren't constantly relying on your neighbor for help. Yes she loves her job, yes she politely told you to reach out until you got the hang of sorting things out when your daughter has a seizures. She is not your personal physician though.  you're treating her like she's your own personal urgent care.\n\nYTA\n\nEdited for typo", "She\u2019s your neighbor, not your on call physician. \n\nOnce was neighborly. Five times\u2026.\n\nYTA", "I imagine it was a scary situation when your daughter had a seizure late at night, so I can understand you grabbing/reaching for anything that would help resolve the situation.  Having said that, once or twice is fine, but three or four times is getting out of hand, meaning you should have an emergency plan in place that does not involve relying on your neighbor.  You are imposing.  I will not say YTA, but get a plan in place (or let her bill you for her WORK).", "As someone in the health professions field (not a doctor but another health/medical professional), asking for help once or twice isn't typically an issue. Asking 5 times, with 3 of those disrupting her sleep, is becoming an issue, but I would still say NTA since your neighbor has been nice about it. Continuing to ask, especially if you are waking her up at night, is entering Y-T-A territory.\n\nWe all need 'down' time to rest and refresh so we can give our best to our patients. Having friends, family, neighbors, etc. seek free care and advice outside of our normal working hours and environment is draining. Lack of sleep can compromise her ability to care for her paying patients, who deserve her uncompromised care. Figure out how you would handle your daughter having a seizure at home if your neighbor wasn't a doctor and do that instead of constantly going to her. \n\nAnd a gesture of compensation for the time and care she has already given would go a long way to keeping your relationship with her neighborly. I'm not suggesting money, but taking the family a home cooked meal, some pastries, cookies, desserts, would likely be appreciated.", "YTA. She has a day job, which involves tremendous responsibility and attention to details. Imagine her being sleep deprived and treating her patients during the day. Maybe she went the extra mile for you because something resonated with her strongly but just because she\u2019s kind, it doesn\u2019t mean you take advantage of her completely. You are going to burn her out sooner or later.", "YTA mildly. Your cousin is right.", "YTA. First time, sure, you're freaking out and don't know what to do. After that, you need to take her to doctors who are at work and will be paid for their services.", "Talk to your neighbor. Make sure it ACTUALLY okay that you're calling her. She works in a busy field with two small children. She may not want to be called but understands how worried you are and doesn't want to hurt your feelings. She may be coming over every time because she feels legally obligated to as a physician. I won't say Y T A because you are legitimately worried about your child but this conversation needs to happen ASAP", "ESH. Obviously you are very concerned and worried about your daughter. As you should. \n\nBUT your cousin does have a point. You can\u2018t just assume Isabel is fine with it without asking her. She might just want to try to keep the peace. \n\nYou are coming close to AH territory. Isabel has her own family to worry about and has a demanding job and being woken up by you late at night is very inconsiderate of you. \n\nI think we can all agree that it is obvious that you worry about your daughter, but you also can\u2018t always expect Isabel to drop everything just to come help you out. Emergencies are there for a reason.", "It is kinda crazy you haven't even considered getting or doing something nice for the neighbor and you're just assuming she's doing it because she loves the night time excitement", "YTA. You are taking advantage of Isabel. Your cousin has empathy and consideration for Isabel. You do not. You're making her be at your beck and call. I'm sorry your daughter is sick but that doesn't justify you exploiting your neighbor. She has a job and a life of her own but you're making her drop everything and come running every single time. You're being a selfish asshole.", "Nah. But stop relying on your neighbour so much. They also have a life, a job and two small children and they are not your on-call healthcare providor.", "YTA...she should be billing you.", "Oh, the entitlement...\n\nOf course YTA, she is your neighbor, she is not your personal servant. Everybody understands helping a neighbor once but has been three times and you feel like that's fine to keep disturbing this woman who probably have a very demanding job and now, doesn't even have the peace to enjoy her time off at home. Take your daughter to see a doctor and stop being inconsiderate.", "NAH\nPhysicians have different approaches to this. I stop when I can help. Isabel is going far out of her way to help, but she realizes this will get better. The seizures will get to be fewer, and you will deal with them better. You're parents with a child in need and are reaching out wherever you can.\n\nTake care of your daughter. Know it will get better.\n\nThank Isabel. It would be appropriate to get her something to thank her. For some reason consumables (wine, fruit basket) seem more appropriate. Go on health grades and Google and praise her. Write a thank you note (you have no idea how rare these are and how much they mean). I still have thank you notes from 20 years ago.\n\nTry to be independent when these happen, even if you call Isabel. We like calls that go \"Jane had a seizure. We moved her somewhere safe, gave her valium, and called 911. But she's still seizing\" It shows you're learning and moving to more independence.\n\nIn truth there's not much we do in the ER for active seizures once they stop, and they usually stop with few interventions.  Talk to her neurologist about getting a plan of what to do, when things are ok, and when to call 911.  I'm in an ER and most of our seizure visits involve nothing more than a call to the patient's neurologist.", "Nah, but getting close. As someone who has a kid who has seizures,  you need to learn what to do in these instances.  You need to talk to doctors about rescue meds and what to do for a seizure and when it's necessary to go to the hospital for seizures.  It's your child so you guys need to be parents and start asking another of questions and learn what to do because your neighbor isn't always gonna be there to hold your hand", "Your neighbor sounds absolutely lovely but yes, I would start handling your emergency room visits without her. She's probably already on call for part of the month, tired from parenting two young children and working full time as a doctor. You weren't the asshole for panicking and calling her the first time or two but don't continue to do it. Ask your daughters neurologist for an emergency care plan- they should have an after hours phone number for you to use. NAH", "NAH. It sounds like Isabel wants to help, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have gone above and beyond by coming to the hospital and staying so long. \n\nOn the other hand, you need to realize that her helping you IS a huge imposition. This is her job, and I doubt that you would want to do 20-30 hours of free work for a neighbor, including 3 sleepless nights in 2 weeks. If you don\u2019t eventually do something to show how much you appreciate her help, I do think that you would veer into asshole territory.", "NAH\n\nOther than maybe your cousin for going off on you - I suspect he could have been a little more diplomatic.\n\nBut I do think you may be relying upon your neighbour a little too much and now is a good time to both thank them profusely and also ask if they would prefer you to not disturb them.", "NAH. \nMaybe a nice thank you gift would be welcome in addition to creating an action plan for moving forward.", "Mildly NTA - you're not an AH, yet. Your neighbor is a doctor, but that doesn't mean she doesn't have a life. I agree with your wife that talking to them and expressing how grateful you are is needed.", "Bearing in mind OP has said that their neighbor has offered their help, and it's still been a pretty short period of time, I will say NTA. But I would recommend figuring out a long-term solution without the neighbor, simply because it is a lifelong condition and that would be the best for everyone. \n\nI will say you should still do something for your neighbor, be it offering to help them out whenever they need and baking them some cookies, or asking if you can treat them to a nice dinner one night as a thank you.", "Nah. You could be imposing on her..... she genuinely might want to help. Use your big boy words and have an adult conversation with them and find out the only opinion that really counts if you're an ah or not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
