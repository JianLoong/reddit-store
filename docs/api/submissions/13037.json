I don't want to kick you while you're down, but you do need to understand that the statement that you haven't done anything to them is not entirely correct. Your actions will have an impact on your kids, whether that is now or in the future. \n\nHOWEVER, your wife is in the wrong here. You do not involve children in parental disputes. You do not talk negatively about one parent to your children. You do not manipulate your children to get a dig in at your partner. You do not damage your children because your relationship is no longer functioning on a romantic level. You are their dad. You clearly love them. I am so sorry that your wife is doing this, because this is not acceptable under any circumstances. \n\nI think ESH. You wife's behaviour is appalling. I'm glad that you are seeking help.

OP, you cannot possibly really believe you didn't do wrong to your wife and your children by becoming an addict. Take responsibility. At the same time, your wife is damaging your children by telling them their dad is a bad man. Her level of contempt for you instead of support to get you clean tells me this marriage is likely over. You can try marriage counseling along with everything else. I don't think it will work. What a mess. Poor kids.", "ESH, but you more.\nI am a recovering addict (22 yrs) and I can tell you unequivocally that you did harm your wife and kids. You may say they never saw you high...but are you *sure*? Or maybe they didn't see you at all. How much money did you spend on drugs? What else could your family have done with that money? Were you ever irritable or irrational when you were coming down, or when you were out? Did you ever lie to your wife?\n\nEvery addict I ever met thinks that nobody ever had any idea, and that they never hurt anyone. And every single one of us is mistaken.\n\nOf course your wife is hurt. You lied to her, risked your life (and possibly your family's depending on circumstances), spent money that could have supported your family more, and countless other small things you didn't even notice.\n\nShe's in the wrong to be bad mouthing you to the kids...but she does have the right to be angry. I'd recommend Al-Anon or Nar-Anon so she can have support in working through her own issues surrounding your addiction.\n\nAnd keep going to your support groups. Dig right into the Program. I had a LOT to learn about addiction, and its impact on my life, and the lives of those around me. It takes a long time to heal all that hurt.", "ESH. Poor freaking kids", "ESH and that\u2019s assuming your account of what your wife said is accurate, which I doubt a lot. You\u2019re an AH for the drugs & for telling yourself or anyone else the lie that your drug usage didn\u2019t wrong your wife or hurt your kids. It did. It robbed them of your time & attention, & very likely a lot of money that your family could have used for better things. Your drug usage & the lies you tell are very likely going to cost you your marriage, yet another way you\u2019re hurting your kids. You\u2019re still making excuses about how it wasn\u2019t that bad, it was your job\u2019s fault not yours, yadda yadda. Your wife is right.

Your wife is completely wrong for how she is going about telling your kids about your drug problem, but your story doesn\u2019t add up. If you are actively putting in an effort to get sober / stay sober, it doesn\u2019t seem like there should be as much animosity coming from your wife (keyword \u201cas\u201d much). \n\nI\u2019m a recovering alcoholic and put my wife through a lot of shit.

You for taking the drugs and her from essentially using the children against you because of it. They are too young to understand, and she's telling them you're a \"bad man\" which is inappropriate in any context. Drugs are bad, using them is bad, but you're not a bad man. Children that age can't see the distinction. \n\nShe just sounds very angry (and rightfully disgusted, it was a poor choice of yours to make). Keep working on getting sober. Ask her to talk to you directly, not fight with you through your underage children.", "\n>I have never wronged my wife because of drugs \n\nThis statement tells me either you haven't actually been to support groups, or aren't paying attention. \n\nYou have harmed her. You are harming her by continuing to use (you didn't mention stopping). You won't have any perspective on this connected to reality until you recognize that. She didn't go from loving to scorning you for no reason.\n\nYTA. Maybe an ESH for how she brought it up and talked about it, but you're way more in the wrong here and seem in denial about why.", "ESH. I don\u2019t think you recognise that your drug use has harmed your wife and family. I suspect there were likely things that you\u2019ve done, that now are being explained by your drug use. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re now getting help, but considering you told your wife a few months ago (how many months?) she may be expecting you to be more proactive in trying to get clean. You don\u2019t say whether you\u2019ve managed to quit, just that you\u2019ve found a few support groups. There\u2019s no indication in your post that you\u2019re fully dedicated to beating this addiction.\n\nSo while the language your wife chose to use is problematic, I don\u2019t think that hiding the struggle you\u2019re having from your kids is the way to go either. \n\nHow would you like her to phrase it? Drugs are bad, people who do drugs are\u2026? (Here\u2019s a hint.

Your behavior was absolutely harmful to your wife. You may think it didn\u2019t, but all the signs were likely there. Your behaviors change and people can tell. You likely blew a lot of money that should have been going towards your kids. \n\nOn the other hand, there is a proper way to talk about the stuff with kids. Your wife went about it completely inappropriately. Those poor kids.", "ESH, but mostly you. \n\nYes, her bringing it up with the kids was wrong. \n\nBut you are delusional if you think your drug use hasn\u2019t hurt your wife or kids.

My ex husband had a coke habit that cost him his marriage and his family. He still will not accept responsibility of this and your comment saying you've not wronged your wife just shows how unready you are for help. A doctor cannot help you, there is no magic anti coke shot they will refer you to counselling which you should be doing yourself. Go to rehab, go to counselling, go to na groups anything you can to prove to your wife you want to fix this and recover. Words mean nothing actions speak a million times louder. I would hazard a guess at you say its not a problem, you will get help, things will get better... until you do actually show actions and follow through, it means nothing. We lost our house, I was left in thousands of pounds of debt and I finally saw the light when my 9 year old son asked me where daddy was as he said he was nipping out to the shop and he'd been gone 5 hours. I never involved my children in our arguments which is the only reason I am saying ESH but believe me your children will be picking up on things already.

Did you start with an amphetamine and escalate to coke? This word \"drugs\" - the plural - makes me wonder there might be more to the story and that your wife has reached the end of her rope. That does not justify what she said to your sons, but it would help provide context about her anger", "I haven\u2019t used in 10 days but I\u2019ve been using coke properly since the beginning of 2021. And yeah it has , we\u2019re doing alright financially anyway which means it doesn\u2019t affect us too badly but there have definitely been questions in the past about where my money is going. And that\u2019s also why my wife is upset, as she used to think I had a gambling problem and she was so supportive before. She\u2019s upset that I hid so much but also because a lot of it makes sense to her now , she noticed I was off or just not feeling like myself so many times and I had so many chances to tell her but I didn\u2019t. Thank you also for the message", "The question was whether OP was the asshole for asking his wife not to bring up his drug addiction to his kids in an unproductive way by saying things like \u201cyour daddy did drugs so he is bad\u201d. Not whether he\u2019s wronged his higher power and needs to make amends to his wife & everyone in his social circle for dare falling prey to an unhealthy coping mechanism. \n\nNTA. Absolutely having a substance abuse problem doesn\u2019t warrant your co-parent painting you as an evil villain to your children. Your poor children. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Best of luck and be well.", "He is an asshole for asking his wife to not tell his young children he is addicted to cocaine? Because that is the topic at hand here. That is his question.", "They would resent him so much if he OD. Just knowing that they have to now be aware of what to do in case of an OD is awful and damaging.", "what exactly do you expect a 6 year old to do if he did overdose", "Of course I know how. I do realise now that my post sounds really stereotypically oblivious like you said but I didn\u2019t mean \u201cwronged my wife\u201d in that context. I meant like I never stole from her (or anyone), I never did anything specifically to her . Obviously drug usage would also impact on her, I was just trying to say that there wasn\u2019t some context I\u2019m trying to leave out here or anything.", "[deleted]", "No kidding. My work bestie lost his brother to H (won't say the name but I'm sure you can guess) it was laced with fentanyl. His dad found him in his room the next morning on his bed with the needle still in his arm. My work bestie still hasn't walked down the hallway in his parents house (he's moved out) and it happened about a decade ago. YTA, op. I hope, for everyone's sake, you get the right help.", "where did op even act like it's not a big deal and also op literally did mention getting help?", "Thanks D.A.R.E.!", "And those kids are way too young to be shouldering the burden of knowing about drug addiction. The wife is bac-mouthing her husband because she is rightfully pissed. But her behavior is misplaced and damaging to the children. Jesus, it is bad enough that they have to have an addict father, but they have to deal with their mother\u2019s behavior too? Poor kids.", "I also have at agree. Yes, this is a failure and, no, you are not doomed to fail forever. Your wife, however, has lost every ounce of respect for you. Did she cry when she learned you turned to drugs to cope with work? Did she feel helpless?\n\nNo, your wife turned her nose up to your issues AND told the kids to disrespect you. Are you even her husband or just a piggy bank? You have tarnished her image of a perfect family by being weak and she is turning EVERYONE against you. Good luck, man. The divorce will not be kind.", "OP doesn't have cancer. OP uses Cocaine to \"Cope\".", "While I agree that the wife is punching below the belt, remember there are three sides to every story: his, hers, and the truth. OP doesn't think he has wronged his wife (and presumably, his sons) by using drugs. I completely agree it what she did is an AH move and that there are more appropriate ways of discussing the situation with the sons. \n\nYes, she can choose to support him as he works through this addiction, but she also has every right to be angry with OP. Drug addiction is costly and puts people at risk. Why should the wife be the one to leave? She didn't didn't spend the money for bills, or braces, or little league on coke. She didn't bring a drug into the house that if she was careless with and her kids found it, there could have been disastrous results.", "really him having andusing hard drugs in the house can cause the kids to be removed. he's an asshole and a drug addiction. he needs to blame himself.not his wife. don't want the kids to know about it don't do hard drugs", "Coke is about $100/gram. I don\u2019t even want to begin to imagine how many thousands he\u2019s wasted\u2026 \n\nBut yeah, the wife is super wrong to say that to their children. \n\nESH", "My wife didn\u2019t find out about anything else I had taken until I told her everything but yeah. I have smoked weed for a while (she knew about this and was fine with it though), and yeah it was amphetamines. I just moved on I suppose, I didn\u2019t really use them for long and I wasn\u2019t addicted", "> Not whether he\u2019s wronged his higher power and needs to make amends to his wife & everyone in his social circle \n\nI will simply note my disagreement with you, that I think OP declaring that he's doing nothing to harm his wife, is very relevant to addressing his question as to whether he was an asshole in how he responded to his wife when she expressed hurt. \n\nLike I said I don't agree with how she handlesd it, but I don't think you can divorce that response from the fact that he's a currently using addict not getting clean and defending his drug use, who has young kids.", "Yeah, the wife is a colossal asshole unless there's something massive he's not disclosing.\n\nWhat kind of person says that to a kid?!", "it is horrible. children should not be in that position, but it seems these children are, or could be.", "call for help, and understand what is happening so they can relate that to the help coming.", "So, because you didn't *actively* seek to harm her, it's not that bad?", "INFO: Where is your drug money coming from? If it's coming from the job you work to earn money to help support your family, then you are indeed harming your wife and kids. \n\nYou broke your wife's trust and faith in you. Do you not think that's just as harmful as stealing from her. You have harmed her in one of the worst ways possible. \n\nESH, because she should keep her adult heartbreak between the two of you, but you are by far the biggest AH. You don't have any moral high ground here at all.", ">I meant like I never stole from her (or anyone), I never did anything specifically to her .\n\nDid you have a cocaine fairy who got you high for free, then?", "It sounds like OP is still actively using. He is probably not the best judge right now of how or if his family has been harmed by his addiction. It's unlikely that this hasn't had a negative impact in some way.", "lol, 'fixing his shit'.  He isn't even at the point of understanding how it hurts others; he doesn't actually say anywhere there that he even wants to quit.", "OP is still using and claims their wife has no reason for upset because his drug use never hurt her. \n\nHe is in the downplaying and denial stage still.", "He doesn't even actually say he's trying to quit.  He's joined support groups and he'll see a doctor eventually.  Meanwhile he's still dependent and expects his wife to be ok with it.\n\nTBH he doesn't sound like he's actually really even reached the point of seeing it as a serious problem.  Maybe divorce, followed by losing custody because he's on drugs, will help.", "Addiction is still a medical issue though.", "By leave I mean end the marriage. I don't mean she should be the one to move out. Poor choice of words on my part. Bottom line, the way she went about it is really messed up.", "I know the money is trivial in comparison to having a substance abuse issue and the damaging comment the wife/mom has made to the kids ... but even if OP isn't the sole source of income, he could be risking the roof over his kids' heads.", "A 6 year old is not gonna be able to describe an overdose", "Yeah my job. It\u2019s not affecting us really too bad but yes I see what you mean. I was just trying not to leave details out", "I was literally thinking this exact thing.", "as someone who works with addicts, people don't quit cold turkey and it can often be dangerous, and he's in support groups and waiting for a doctor", "Agreed. \n\nI think OP has been intentionally vague about some details. It sort of reads like he might be out of the house, so could there be a separation in the works (?) - I'm going off of that the kids are being told by the mom/wife and not OP and wife together.", "For that reason, I think it\u2019s just as bad. An inherent part of addiction.", "maybe not, but a 6 yr. old can say my Daddy is an addict.", "\u201cNot affecting us really too bad\u201d\n\nYou are trying to downplay the effect this is having and justify it. At the end of the day you *are* stealing from your family.\nTake that money and look into a therapist or private counselling for your habit. Show your wife you are being proactive. Maybe once you show her you are trying and committed, she\u2019ll stop involving your children.", "Just to add another take: one of my neighbours hid a coke addiction from his wife for years. He made good money, didn\u2019t think too much of it. Then he started to defer mortgage payments. Then the bank sent a letter addressed to both. They were in major debt. He said he could handle it. But he couldn\u2019t handle that and the divorce\u2026she told everyone, ruined his reputation and now he lives in a one bed flat, still uses and neither of his kids will speak to him.", "I'm not judging OP for not quitting right away without support. I'm just noting the language he's using is absolutely downplaying it. \n\nAs someone with experience as well, the language of \"I'm using it to get through the day, I don't like that I'm reliant and want to stop but I'm not hurting anyone else\" is what you say before you're at the stage of actually taking stock and responsibility."]}
