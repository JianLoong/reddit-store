I don't want to kick you while you're down, but you do need to understand that the statement that you haven't done anything to them is not entirely correct. Your actions will have an impact on your kids, whether that is now or in the future. \n\nHOWEVER, your wife is in the wrong here. You do not involve children in parental disputes. You do not talk negatively about one parent to your children. You do not manipulate your children to get a dig in at your partner. You do not damage your children because your relationship is no longer functioning on a romantic level. You are their dad. You clearly love them. I am so sorry that your wife is doing this, because this is not acceptable under any circumstances. \n\nI think ESH. You wife's behaviour is appalling. I'm glad that you are seeking help.

OP, you cannot possibly really believe you didn't do wrong to your wife and your children by becoming an addict. Take responsibility. At the same time, your wife is damaging your children by telling them their dad is a bad man. Her level of contempt for you instead of support to get you clean tells me this marriage is likely over. You can try marriage counseling along with everything else. I don't think it will work. What a mess. Poor kids.", "ESH, but you more.\nI am a recovering addict (22 yrs) and I can tell you unequivocally that you did harm your wife and kids. You may say they never saw you high...but are you *sure*? Or maybe they didn't see you at all. How much money did you spend on drugs? What else could your family have done with that money? Were you ever irritable or irrational when you were coming down, or when you were out? Did you ever lie to your wife?\n\nEvery addict I ever met thinks that nobody ever had any idea, and that they never hurt anyone. And every single one of us is mistaken.\n\nOf course your wife is hurt. You lied to her, risked your life (and possibly your family's depending on circumstances), spent money that could have supported your family more, and countless other small things you didn't even notice.\n\nShe's in the wrong to be bad mouthing you to the kids...but she does have the right to be angry. I'd recommend Al-Anon or Nar-Anon so she can have support in working through her own issues surrounding your addiction.\n\nAnd keep going to your support groups. Dig right into the Program. I had a LOT to learn about addiction, and its impact on my life, and the lives of those around me. It takes a long time to heal all that hurt.", "ESH. Poor freaking kids", "ESH and that\u2019s assuming your account of what your wife said is accurate, which I doubt a lot. You\u2019re an AH for the drugs & for telling yourself or anyone else the lie that your drug usage didn\u2019t wrong your wife or hurt your kids. It did. It robbed them of your time & attention, & very likely a lot of money that your family could have used for better things. Your drug usage & the lies you tell are very likely going to cost you your marriage, yet another way you\u2019re hurting your kids. You\u2019re still making excuses about how it wasn\u2019t that bad, it was your job\u2019s fault not yours, yadda yadda. Your wife is right.

How long did you use / have you been using? Did your drug habit affect your finances?

Your wife is completely wrong for how she is going about telling your kids about your drug problem, but your story doesn\u2019t add up. If you are actively putting in an effort to get sober / stay sober, it doesn\u2019t seem like there should be as much animosity coming from your wife (keyword \u201cas\u201d much). \n\nI\u2019m a recovering alcoholic and put my wife through a lot of shit.

You for taking the drugs and her from essentially using the children against you because of it. They are too young to understand, and she's telling them you're a \"bad man\" which is inappropriate in any context. Drugs are bad, using them is bad, but you're not a bad man. Children that age can't see the distinction. \n\nShe just sounds very angry (and rightfully disgusted, it was a poor choice of yours to make). Keep working on getting sober. Ask her to talk to you directly, not fight with you through your underage children.", "\n>I have never wronged my wife because of drugs \n\nThis statement tells me either you haven't actually been to support groups, or aren't paying attention. \n\nYou have harmed her. You are harming her by continuing to use (you didn't mention stopping). You won't have any perspective on this connected to reality until you recognize that. She didn't go from loving to scorning you for no reason.\n\nYTA. Maybe an ESH for how she brought it up and talked about it, but you're way more in the wrong here and seem in denial about why.", "ESH. I don\u2019t think you recognise that your drug use has harmed your wife and family. I suspect there were likely things that you\u2019ve done, that now are being explained by your drug use. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re now getting help, but considering you told your wife a few months ago (how many months?) she may be expecting you to be more proactive in trying to get clean. You don\u2019t say whether you\u2019ve managed to quit, just that you\u2019ve found a few support groups. There\u2019s no indication in your post that you\u2019re fully dedicated to beating this addiction.\n\nSo while the language your wife chose to use is problematic, I don\u2019t think that hiding the struggle you\u2019re having from your kids is the way to go either. \n\nHow would you like her to phrase it? Drugs are bad, people who do drugs are\u2026? (Here\u2019s a hint.

Your behavior was absolutely harmful to your wife. You may think it didn\u2019t, but all the signs were likely there. Your behaviors change and people can tell. You likely blew a lot of money that should have been going towards your kids. \n\nOn the other hand, there is a proper way to talk about the stuff with kids. Your wife went about it completely inappropriately. Those poor kids.", "ESH, but mostly you. \n\nYes, her bringing it up with the kids was wrong. \n\nBut you are delusional if you think your drug use hasn\u2019t hurt your wife or kids.

My ex husband had a coke habit that cost him his marriage and his family. He still will not accept responsibility of this and your comment saying you've not wronged your wife just shows how unready you are for help. A doctor cannot help you, there is no magic anti coke shot they will refer you to counselling which you should be doing yourself. Go to rehab, go to counselling, go to na groups anything you can to prove to your wife you want to fix this and recover. Words mean nothing actions speak a million times louder. I would hazard a guess at you say its not a problem, you will get help, things will get better... until you do actually show actions and follow through, it means nothing. We lost our house, I was left in thousands of pounds of debt and I finally saw the light when my 9 year old son asked me where daddy was as he said he was nipping out to the shop and he'd been gone 5 hours. I never involved my children in our arguments which is the only reason I am saying ESH but believe me your children will be picking up on things already.

Did you start with an amphetamine and escalate to coke? This word \"drugs\" - the plural - makes me wonder there might be more to the story and that your wife has reached the end of her rope.

And yeah it has , we\u2019re doing alright financially anyway which means it doesn\u2019t affect us too badly but there have definitely been questions in the past about where my money is going. And that\u2019s also why my wife is upset, as she used to think I had a gambling problem and she was so supportive before. She\u2019s upset that I hid so much but also because a lot of it makes sense to her now , she noticed I was off or just not feeling like myself so many times and I had so many chances to tell her but I didn\u2019t. Thank you also for the message", "The question was whether OP was the asshole for asking his wife not to bring up his drug addiction to his kids in an unproductive way by saying things like \u201cyour daddy did drugs so he is bad\u201d.

Addiction is a cruel dragon to vanquish. \n\nNAH- your wife feels betrayed, but she should not be badmouthing you to your children. As you well know, drugs are not ok, neither is lying.

Congratulations on what you\u2019ve done so far for getting help. Seriously. I don\u2019t know any details of the addiction and you absolutely don\u2019t need to go telling the internet at large. Taking steps to get help and counseling for it and sticking to trying to get help with how hard it is with wait times etc is admirable I think. \n\nRegarding specifically your posted question- NTA!!! she\u2019s the asshole. I don\u2019t know why the hell people are commenting and shitting on you so much. I have personal experience with parents attacking each other to manipulate us and saying shit exactly like that to us growing up. It\u2019s hard to hear. It puts your kids in a horrible situation. Depending on the kids it could really damage your relationship with them. How does she want them to react? To hate you and never speak to you again? To not respect you anymore? To go tell all their friends what their mommy said and have your personal medical situation become school gossip? It\u2019s insanely shitty. I get that she\u2019s hurt and has been hurt by your addiction, I have a lot of empathy for that. And if she doesn\u2019t want to talk or be with you anymore because of this, I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s okay. But she\u2019s being manipulative and using your children as a weapon with her anger. She can be as upset as she wants but there\u2019s a line when involving children. \n\nRegarding other peoples comments !! Look. I haven\u2019t gone to see if OP has other posts or comments going into more detail. But with the given information everyone needs to take a step back and breath. Yes. Addiction is hard. For everyone. It has effected his family in a major way I\u2019m sure even if it\u2019s not apparent to OP yet. Trying to get better doesn\u2019t erase that the problem happened, absolutely. And the wife has a right to feel betrayed and angry and whatever else she might be. But none of us know (based off this post) exactly what his family did or didn\u2019t have to deal with. It\u2019s really surprising to me that so many commenters seemed to have stopped reading once OP wrote that they are an addict. Doing Coke once and doing it every time after was a bad decision on OP\u2019s part and it did put his family at risk, I\u2019m not arguing that they\u2019re a saint here. But he\u2019s not asking if he\u2019s a shit father or husband because of his addiction, and if he was we still couldn\u2019t judge just with the information that he\u2019s and addict and a father/husband. Seriously.\n\nOP! Just a note. With said experience of growing up with parents who hated each other and would involve their kids in their drama, you should start documenting things I think. I don\u2019t know you or her or what either of you are feeling. But right now if she filed for a divorce you would have a hard time when it comes to custody I think. Even if you\u2019re in a better place financially right now she can use your addiction and how much you work against you. And if she\u2019s telling your kids how horrible of a person you are and they believe/repeat it then that can have an effect too. If your kids start talking about it in school and your teachers hear etc she can use all of that in court. I\u2019d seriously recommend counseling for the both of you, together and separate. And maybe some for the kids now that they know. (Family counseling maybe?) It\u2019ll help them to talk to someone professional about it that\u2019s not mom vs dad. (It\u2019ll look good in court too if anything does go that far)", "With regards to the ACTUAL QUESTION of this topic, which clearly other people skimmed over or ignored entirely, NTA\n\nDealing with the fallout of your addiction and its effects on your family overall is a whole other conversation, but in this one specific point I believe it's a fair request. Especially when she is deliberately telling your children you're a bad person for it. It's definitely the kind of conversation to have with your kids where you can still admit your wrong but also bring a sense of nuance to it so they can further develop an understanding of WHY some people end up turning to drugs. Your wife is doing nothing but giving them a negative view of addiction which ultimately will help no one, though I can understand why she is choosing to express herself this way\n\nPerhaps see if you can get the two of you into some form of couples counselling to find the next steps forward, and of course continue your own individual therapy/rehab/whatever ends up working. Ultimately I hope your recovery goes as smoothly as it can", "YTA, as the former child of an addict, I knew my dad was using drugs by the time I was 5. Kids are not stupid and neither are yours. You may think you hid your addiction well but you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m glad you are getting help now, but if your children have questions you should answer them in an age appropriate way.

Yes, you undeniably caused some harm to your family as a result of your addiction. So it\u2019s important to own up to that. I understand how much shame there is in this, but it is something you are going to have to come to terms with. Please seek actual SUD counseling instead of just support groups. Figure out what led you to turn to cocaine to cope and learn how to more safely and effectively manage stress without it. As for your wife\u2019s behavior, that is possibly more AH behavior in my opinion. Your children did nothing wrong here. Her behavior is actively harming them. And they do not need to worry about their dad or their parents relationship. And just in case you maybe read this - you are not a bad person. Your BEHAVIOR was bad. You two need to get into counseling ASAP. Either separate or learn how to start repairing your relationship but whatever you do nip this thing in the bud for the sake of your kids.", "NTA.

First off, I\u2019m so sorry your wife is talking badly about you to your kids. Addiction can affect literally anyone, even your wife whether she believes it or not. It\u2019s a disease that crosses all socioeconomic class, gender, age, and race lines. And while people often want to believe addiction is just a series of bad choices, it\u2019s so much more than that. Yes bad choices can be made as a result but that\u2019s not always the case. There are so many people out in the world, in professions you\u2019d never expect, with raging addiction problems. What many would call functional addicts. It sounds like this is the category you fall into. And honestly whether you\u2019d be considered \u201cfunctional\u201d or not doesn\u2019t matter because parents should never speak badly to their children about their other parent. That\u2019s just a big no no that usually ends in confused hurt kids. You have every right to ask her not to mention this to your kids. I mean kids are so much smarter than they are ever given credit for. They may have an idea that something is going on, but there\u2019s no reason for her to tell your kids you\u2019re a bad man. That\u2019s just not necessary and it\u2019s cruel to those kids. Idk your wife so maybe she\u2019s just handling the news really poorly and hopefully will get over this phase of shit talking you to your kids, but I would maybe try to do couples therapy with her to get to the root of this. The kids will already be going thru a lot the more this comes out, and they need to know they can rely on her thru this, and not end up having to comfort her bc she\u2019s angry at you for being sick. \n\nYou mentioned you might go somewhere so are you considering rehabs? Maybe even a short detox first. Just curious, but feel free to DM me OP if you need help looking for resources either in your area or away from home, which is usually preferable. Don\u2019t let their mother get the last word and shame you for what you\u2019re going thru. Addiction is a disease, NOT a moral failing. If I were you, I would set time aside to sit the kids down and talk to them when you know their mother will be gone for a while, so she can\u2019t interrupt and start calling you names. Tell them what you\u2019re comfortable with in age appropriate terms. I know a lot of people use general terms like saying they\u2019re sick and need to go to a hospital to get better. So I\u2019d say something like, \u201cI know mommy has shared that daddy has been struggling lately. I\u2019m sick right now but I\u2019m going to get better. I have to go away to a hospital for a little while to get better, but please don\u2019t worry because I will come back feeling great and I\u2019ll be here to play with you guys and always be your dad. I\u2019m so proud of you both and I love you so much.\u201d Or something like that. I\u2019d keep it as simple as possible and let them ask u any questions if they have any, and then of course answer in age appropriate ways that they will understand but won\u2019t scare them. Mainly what they want to know is if you\u2019re going to be ok and if you\u2019re going to come back and keep being their dad and if you will still love them, all of which the answers to are yes, so let them know that. They may be scared after hearing the shit their mom said to them so it would be great to give them space to talk to you. Up to u if you tell your wife you spoke to them. You don\u2019t want her weaponizing that but it also might get her to chill if she knows u spoke to them and they have their questions answered so she doesn\u2019t have to fill in blanks with her angry 2cents anymore. And you might need couples therapy for this to sink in for her, but she has to understand that by talking negatively about you she\u2019s severally damaging her children. And that\u2019s never ok. I hope she stops trashing you to the kids, but most importantly focus on getting yourself well so you can come back stronger than ever and show your boys that you are here for them, and you\u2019re here to stay so they don\u2019t have to stress. That\u2019ll be much more meaningful to them than any ludicrous shit their mom has to say about you, and will even show her she should keep her thoughts to herself. Do this for you because if you don\u2019t do it for you it won\u2019t stick. And you need it to stick bc you have 2 sweet boys who really need you. Even if at first you\u2019re getting clean for them, that\u2019s totally fine as long as somewhere along the way you start doing it for you and your happiness too. You deserve a happy, fulfilling life and you will have that when you get clean and find a job that isn\u2019t so stressful. Proud of you for stepping up to work on this and for taking the steps you need to take to get to recovery. It\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s simple, just follow the advice of your therapists and sponsors and you\u2019ll be golden, helping the newbies out in no time.
