{"id": 1243, "submission_id": "ym1rdq", "title": "AITA for blocking my friend?", "selftext": "I live in Georgia and there is a lot of pressure for everyone to vote. Which I understand completely. I think it is very important. However, my friend is EXTREMELY political, like she's spent the past few months going door-to-door campaigning kind of extreme. I support her and her decisions even though it's not something I would do personally. \n\nToday, she texted me about early voting and I told her I was busy today between work and going with my boyfriend to his puppy's vet appointment, so if I had time I would go. I had already planed on going on the eighth because there is a voting place that day literally across the street from my apartment. Honestly, I've had some really bad health issues recently and I'm too tired to shower let alone make a half-hour drive. And she knows this. I've been very honest with her about the side effects of my medication, including sleep deprivation and tremors. \n\nThe minute I told her I would do it if I had time she called my boyfriend and told him he needed to go to the vet appointment alone so I could vote. And I only found out after he texted me telling me he could go alone. At first, I was worried because he thought I might be babying him (he has really bad adhd and its hard for him to focus sometimes i.e. at the last appointment he almost forgot the dog in the car). Then I realized my friend had texted him. And when I called him out he said that she actually CALLED him. While he was at work. I don't even call my boyfriend at work because I know how distracted he can get. I immediately blocked her and expressed my frustrations to him. I also told him how disappointed I was that he was going to let her use him to manipulate me into doing something I probably don't have the energy to do. \n\nTo most people, this probably doesn't sound like a big deal, however, I was manipulated and abused by my alcoholic mother and her daughter most of my life, so trusting people is hard, and women is even harder. I just feel really betrayed and upset. AITA for blocking her? Am I overreacting?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My friend tried to manipulate me through my boyfriend and I blocked the friend.", "created_utc": 1667575204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym1rdq/aita_for_blocking_my_friend/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
