I went no contact with them for approximately four or five months. It didn\u2019t start off as no contact, but things progressed to the point where I told them they were no longer to reach out to me and if they showed up at my condo (to which they had a key), I would call the police and have the locks changed.\n\nMy mom took this particularly hard. She really didn\u2019t understand what she had done that was wrong which was beyond frustrating. She\u2019d send messages and emails trying to justify herself.\nI felt extremely upset about going no contact but ultimately found it to be a liberating experience. I ended up reconnecting with my sister whom I thought was not speaking to me but it turned out my phone was not sending me push notifications when she would message me on WhatsApp (she lives in a different country).\n\nSo anyway, in June or July of last year I reached out to my parents and explained that we could have a phone call but that it was not going to be a two way conversation. I was going to do all the talking initially and if they wanted to, I\u2019d give them the opportunity to respond at the end. I was very clear though that this was an opportunity for me to explain why what had happened had affected me so deeply and why I was so angry with them.\n\nThe call actually went much better than anticipated. They were silent and listened and the few times they started to speak up, I reminded them that this was not currently a two-way street.\nMy mother played the whole situation off as a misunderstanding although I don\u2019t buy it. My father didn\u2019t realize I wasn\u2019t speaking to him either (he thought it was just my mother who I was angry with, but he can be a little emotionally shallow so I\u2019m not that surprised). Following the phone call, I agreed to see them again on limited terms. It\u2019s taken some work, but we\u2019re back in a good place.\n\nI still think about last year and I think about how this community helped me from going over the deep end. So I wanted to say thank you!\n\nEdit: and if anyone is curious how the birthday ended up going, I blew about 250 bucks on myself on Grubhub and one of my college friends organized an impromptu Zoom session with our group of friends across the country to sing happy birthday to me after I called to discuss the situation (we had been together when I was visiting them that weekend when the conversation with my mother first started).", "created_utc": 1675894557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xclxz/update_aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_therapists/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Meet for very short periods in public places.
