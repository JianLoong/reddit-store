I'd rethink the kind of friends they are. No apology needed.", "You are definitely not the asshole from what I read. To me, it sounds like they are the kind of people who think they are always right. Don't apologize. Tell them how they made you feel. If they still can't acknowledge they were wrong to do that, then cut them off.", "NTA. Sounds like they were being mean girls. \n\nAlso sounds like no one knows how to make bolognese. Not sure what the recipe was, but the longer you simmer, the richer the flavour. If you kept simmering the pot after the water was added it would have intensified everything. This is what I do  when I keep it on the stove for hours. You\u2019re friends were also wrong to think they could make one in twenty minutes, so long story short, ESH because they are pretending to cook a proper sauce!", "NTA. How frustrating for you! I'm sorry that they messed with your cooking and then blamed you for it being subpar. I recommend not cooking for or with these specific friends again. There are other people who won't ruin the food you're making for them, and who will appreciate the efforts you go to. Maybe you can find other enjoyable activities to do with your food wrecking friends.\n\nYou're not TA for being upset. That's perfectly reasonable. You are unlikely to get them to understand that they ruined your dish.", "There is an episode of Masterchef Australia where a contestant panics and adds extra water to her gravy. The judges react with horror. Nigella Lawson, the guest judges, nearly faints. The contestant herself realizes a second later that she has done a stupid thing. (Edit) The gravy completely lost its flavour, and it was very good before she added the extra water. \n\nYour friends don't know enough about cooking to comment on your sauce, and you don't owe them an apology. NTA. Cook for people who deserve your effort.", "honestly, NTA, your reaction is valid, you were clearly looking forward to the cooking and EVEN IF the food was really tasteless, that doesn't mean they can just mess with it however they want, also cooking with the ingredients you went and bought??that's not very nice after what they did.Also you don't owe them an apology also diluting does decrease taste so yeah", "NTA. Too many cooks spoiled the bolognese", "NTA-  I would be livid.  Just livid.  At the friend who poured the water. Who just does that to someone else\u2019s recipe?", "INFO: what are they claiming you did to ruin the night?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I did let them know I wished my friend hadn\u2019t done that. I also argued that \u201cyes, water dilutes taste\u201d which they both disagreed with (?????), and I dropped it. I didn\u2019t even say anything when they \u201ctook over\u201d.

This post is me sincerely asking - did I overreact (probably to an extent)", "I personally would have tried the food before adding anything, but I am also Russian, and that is custom for me.

Did you use a meat substitute or mushrooms?", "I'm sorry but ~400ml of water shouldn't render a full pan of bolognaise tasteless, and a brisk simmer should reduce it back in not too long a time.", "NTA. They poured a full cup of water (cans are usually 8 oz at least) into your sauce, then said it was tasteless after they rendered it tasteless, then made another sauce with YOUR stuff(I\u2019m assuming sans water), praised the second sauce sauce, and expected you to just sit there and laugh and joke? \n\nYeah NTA. You reacted better than I would have.", "I know!! But apparently her family has always done the water-in-the-can thing so  it was apparently a reaction or something\n\nI\u2019ve known her for years and she\u2019s always been a bit like that but yeah, sure - I\u2019ve cut friends out of my life before when they\u2019ve become intolerable.

They took over basically straight away.", "*Why* do you think that adding what could be 50% of the sauce's volume of water wouldn't dilute the taste very much?", "You do you.", "I always do the water in the can but only ever a little- maybe a couple tablespoons at most, and always added before simmering, never after. I don\u2019t know what your friend was thinking", "You're correct. Your friends are bonkers.", "Kinda wondering the same myself tbh but I\u2019m far from being a master chef\n\nIt was more like 25% since I\u2019d used two cans but omg you just made think of something\u2026 wondering if she\u2019d\u2019ve put *two* cans of water in if I hadn\u2019t reacted!!", "I always do, friend. I always do.", "My large saucepot probably holds two quarts / not quite two liters comfortably. Diluting by 20% would be VERY NOTICEABLE. \n\nThe smaller, more often used pot holds about half that volume. Imagine suddenly adding 40% the volume of a sauce in water."]}
