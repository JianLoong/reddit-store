So if one can of water rendered it tasteless, did they dump the water in and then ya'll immediately served it with the unincorporated water floating on top of the rest of the sauce? Was the can a giant can the same size as the pot? Did you not let it summer further so it would incorporate and then adjust the spices?\n\nThey're the AHs no doubt.

They\u2019ll get all soggy. So good pan frying technique matters for your final result.  Don\u2019t put too many in at once because it lowers the oil temp.
