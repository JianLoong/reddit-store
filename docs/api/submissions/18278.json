Hell, when I'm cooking, I make it clear that unless you're grabbing a drink or something, or I ask you, NO ONE is allowed in the kitchen. Not even my wife. It's an extreme pet peeve of mine. It's super disrespectful to mess with someone elses cooking without their permission.", "NTA--But dude, all you had to do was simmer it for another hour or two and the water would have evaporated.
