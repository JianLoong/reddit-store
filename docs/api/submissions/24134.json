Everyone gets along except Kim (NB 19). All summer we\u2019ve tolerated their constant negativity and emotional meltdowns.\n\nYou can\u2019t ask Kim to do a single chore w/o an aggressive apology or them getting so upset you had to comfort them. They\u2019d plan a party, dip out the morning of to visit their bf and not tell anyone, leaving me with all the prep and then show up hours later upset that everyone was having a blast without them.\n\nKim wore a pair of dress shoes with pjs. Why? They don\u2019t like to be barefoot. I ask why they don\u2019t just wear socks, they run to their room crying they don\u2019t like socks and refuse to leave the rest of the night.\n\nWatch a show they don\u2019t like? Get peppered with tons of sarcastic, \u201cI love copaganda!\u201d comments before they'd get frustrated and slink back to their room.They lob unprovoked remarks towards me, which I let slide w/o saying anything (I.e. I was drinking a smoothie and got a snotty, \u201chow\u2019s your silly, little drink?\u201d Or I\u2019d make a mistake and they\u2019d go, \u201cProud of yourself?\")\n\nOnce, an intern asked Kim how the animals were doing as they\u2019d been out to feed them. Kim treated everyone to a rant about how everything was fine and if it wasn\u2019t they\u2019d have said so. Everyone has done their best to weather the negativity without being reactionary towards Kim but it\u2019s gotten increasingly hard.\n\nWe were all working and some of the interns were having a discussion. I hear Kim under their breath, muttering, \u201cGreat, we get to listen to this.\u201d I ignore it and keep working. In a few minutes the subject changes to cooking. A sarcastic, \u201cI love talking about food!\u201d Once again, I ignore Kim. A few seconds later, Kim repeats themselves in an even whiner tone.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might BTA, I completely lost my temper. I told Kim if they had a problem with a conversation they needed to address it like an adult instead of making sarcastic remarks under their breath. If they don\u2019t like it they can ask to change the subject or talk about something else. I wasn\u2019t yelling but I was speaking very harshly and imitated them talking an a whiny voice. Kim started crying. After a few minutes, I apologized and said I didn\u2019t mean to make them cry but that they needed to communicate like an adult instead of passive aggressively. All I got in reply was a huffy, \u201cI\u2019ll consider it next time.\u201d They kept crying and one of the manager\u2019s asked if they needed a break. They spent the rest of the day until lunch hiding and crying. After lunch they didn\u2019t show up until another hour 1/2.\n\nI feel hypocritical that I was unable to talk to them in a calmer manner especially since that was my point. If I could go back, I would say it nicer but I stand by what I said. I\u2019m sick of coddling someone who\u2019s done nothing but act like a toddler and make passive-aggressive digs at me all summer.

Crying is a normal reaction to embarrassment and stress. Crying publicly though tends to be abnormal. Not that its wrong or a failing but its a sign that this person is unstable and not able to perform the correct social behaviors. This person unfortunately needs some kind of mental health intervention as they are exhibiting unstable emotional/mental/social behavior.

In this case professionally means informing your supervisor and letting them handle the situation. Kim isn't a normal housemate where you would be expected to resolve issues personally, they are your colleague, if Kim is behaving inappropriately report it and allow management to decide how to handle the situation.", "Agreed, if I had to be around someone like that, let alone work and live with them for an extended period of time, I might go insane!", "NTA. This behavior is what I would call victim bullying. Kim has learned that by appearing weak and fragile, they can get away with being unpleasant. Courtesy and manners developed in human cultures because they keep people from punching each other in the mouth.", "ESH including whatever weird 'internship' makes you live, work and throw parties with your fellow interns.", "is Kim secretly a girl i went to college with who had a mental breakdown on stage and yelled at the conductor???? like weekly??? in rehearsals?????? i swear these Kims are everywhere, like why do you even talk to people if all you do is bark at them when they request anything of you???? go stay in your sad little hole of a bedroom and stay chronically online i guess", "Some people are just defective, don\u2019t worry about it.

I can't think of any kind of 'work program' that makes you live AND work with the same people. In which case you won't exactly have HR, but there will be people overseeing this program. It sounds like Kim has those over you in authority swayed by her theatrics, or maybe appealed to their savior instincts and buddied up with them.\n\nYou might want to talk to someone over you guys and explain how triggering it is for you to see Kim start this drama, and how the constant crying is too much for you to handle, you need a safe space to deal with the hostility and ever present negativity.", "What I'd take from this is in the future, don't ignore and let things build up until you snap.

Me and my siblings would give each other fun/silly nicknames (not mean ones) and we'd try to include him since he seemed to want to be included, and then he'd go crying to his mum about not liking the nickname instead of talking to us about it.
