{"id": 28791, "submission_id": "176h5p9", "title": "AITA for not responding to medical emergencies/giving medical advice?", "selftext": "I am a physician. For the past several months I have been increasingly asked by family, friends, friends of friends for medical advice. Sometimes I\u2019ll be out with my girlfriend and people we meet up with will ask me medical questions.  I\u2019ve been getting more and more annoyed with this. I work hard and during my time off I feel I shouldn\u2019t have to do this.  Finally the other day I cracked. One of my girlfriend\u2019s friends asked me for advice and I just flat out said \u201cask your doctor.\u201d She goes but you\u2019re a doctor. And I said I\u2019m not your doctor. Later my girlfriend said her friend was annoyed that I wouldn\u2019t help her. I told her simply that I have no obligation to help her and I enjoy my time off not thinking about medicine. She understood and was more just relaying a message. \n\nThis also carries over to medical emergencies. I was at a nice restaurant recently enjoying a meal with my girlfriend after a string of shifts at the hospital. I was enjoying some well deserved time off. Someone a few tables over collapsed and the restaurant asked if there was any medical staff. I simply carried on with my meal and ignored them as I knew if I had gotten up to help it would\u2019ve ruined my evening and I would\u2019ve been salty later. \n\nAITA? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m obligated to be a source of free medical services 24/7.\n\n\nEdit: a lot of people saying I have an oath to do no harm. I do, on the job. Never took an oath to help 24/7 off the job. It\u2019s not illegal in the US in my state to ignore a medical emergency off the job. Sure there are Good Samaritan laws but getting involved in care off the clock can create problems for me. A bad outcome can still result in a report to the medical board from a patient if something was missed. So why the hell would I ruin my night to help someone to potentially cause trouble for myself?  And for everyone saying I have poor bedside manner- not true. You don\u2019t have to believe me but I have excellent reviews from my colleagues and patients. I\u2019m board certified in my field and competent. I just don\u2019t think I should be forced to commit my personal life to strangers off the clock. 911 and paramedics are there for a reason. Anyone can do CPR. And yes it has happened several times. Recently in a restaurant, 2x on a plane, and once on a beach.  And no this is not fake. I have better things to do than post fake shit on Reddit to get a response.", "created_utc": 1697144001, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176h5p9/aita_for_not_responding_to_medical/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Including doctors.", "YTA\nI agree that giving free medical advice is a pain and unnecessary. However, in an emergency like that, you need to do better. You took an oath, whether on the job or not, an oath is important.\n\nIf there is an emergency, no one is saying that you have to be there every second of it. But you could just help until EMT arrive. I would be very nervous to have you as my doctor as I wouldn\u2019t know whether I could count on you if somehow there was an emergency and you had just clocked out 5 seconds before. By your way of thinking, in that situation I would be on my own. It becomes a problem", "I understand not giving advice but not rendering help in an emergency situation is definitely YTA.

As a physician, don't you have an obligation to help in an emergency?", "If they ask you for medical advice, you can say \"you are not their doctor\" and stand your ground with this. If they want to discuss their medical problems in full view of everyone else with no expectation of privacy, then anyone can join in the conversation. The problem I have is the expectation that you should render aid in a medical emergency. Do you know how many have been sued for this? Your practice insurance may not cover you if you are not in your normal place of business. Short of carrying around indemnity forms for relatives to sign in case of emergency, unless it is a life threatening where the only person who can save the life is you, then no TA for your decision.

If you don\u2019t want to help during emergencies because you deserve time off, that is A H ish. Not helping because it ruins your mood is A H ish. However, since Good Samaritan laws do not protect physicians and nurses, and most malpractice policies only cover when working - I don\u2019t blame you for protecting yourself.  Basic life support is something anyone can do. This does not require medical training. \n\nTo all those that think this person is T A H. Go take a CPR and first aid class. Learn to use an AED.

You seem tired and over it, but if someone is actively dying in front of you, then yes I think you should help. \n\nThat's a once in a very long time situation, not aunt Bessie asking you to look at the questionable mole on her neck. \n\nI'm not expecting doctors to be saints, but I feel that if someone needs emergency aid and your response is \"ugh, why me? Nope they can die I want to eat my tea in peace\" then you need to have a sit down and think about where your empathy has gone.", "NTA - You're not people's free doctor whenever they want", "NTA.

Yeah, you offering help to the person who'd collapsed would have been nice but that's what it should have been: you *offering* said help. We don't expect anyone else to work without pay, so why do we expect doctors and nurses to? Being a doctor is your job not your life and you should not be expected to help simply because you're a doctor. It should be your choice on when you choose to use your skills as a doctor.", "I was just on a flight where someone broke their leg, and the doctor sitting behind me didn't help. There were EMTs already helping. I've heard of a lot of doctors complaining about this. NTA", "YTA. It is to say, talk to your doctor. I don\u2019t know your medical history.

Isn't it basically against medical ethics to give medical advice if you are not that specific person's doctor anyway?\n\nBut as for the emergencies, YTA. You were there; the paramedics had to *get* there, which takes time, and time is of the essence in emergencies.", "For free advice, family and friends asking? NTA\n\nEmergencies? YTA, and you just took the AHOTM (asshole of the millennium). Here's why: In an emergency you know that seconds count. A stroke victim, heart attack, etc... And as a physician you are in the best spot to save a life. And you refusing makes you an absolute asshole, because your \"free time\" is now more important than a human life. I was a Soldier a long time ago, and only had rudimentary medical training, and was a trained EMT in the 80's but never did the job. You bet your ass I would provide whatever assistance I could.\n\nDamn, I am now so pissed off at your attitude....... Give back your diploma and go dig a ditch, where you can leave your job at 5pm and not think about it until the next day.", "YTA for not helping the person who collapsed. That person was not rudely trying to get free medical care from you. That was a real emergency, and a decent person would have done all they could to help. Let's hope you're never in an accident, especially a life threatening one, and have a person who could have helped you go blithely on their way. They might even stop to explain to you that they're off duty.", "Sorry, but YTA.  I'm a lawyer and frequently get cornered by people at parties asking for legal advice.  I don't provide them advice, and for the same reason I assume you don't in similar situations: I'm not covered by malpractice.  If it's a question in my area of expertise and it's a friend, not just someone I meet at a party, I ask them to call me at the office the next day.  \n\n\nFortunately, there really isn't such as a thing as a \"legal emergency.\"  However, I will always help a fellow human in distress if I can.

In my view that means YT really, really big A.", "Nothing wrong with declining to help people who aren't your patients and want advice in a non-work setting. But wow, you didn't want someone's medical emergency in a restaurant to ruin your meal? You kept eating through that, within sight of a person who'd collapsed? Your bedside manner must be absolutely delightful. YTA.", "NAH.  It easy to armchair quarterback but from what I see, all aspects of medicine are high stress and overworked.  I believe the best in our medical professionals and believe if the situation required you to step up, you would have.  If not, not NEED to get out of the back to back long shifts.  Physician, heal thyself means you should prioritize your health in order to be able to help others.", "Nope NTA... I'm a nurse and when I'm off the clock; I'm off the clock. Secondly I don't have 100% of the info I need like history, meds, labs etc. Nothing I tell you will be accurate because if I missing 1 bit of needed info the advice I give could cause harm. \n\nI have literally told my school age children when they're acting a fool/ climbing/ double fisting food....Ay!! I'm off the clock; knock it off. \n\nAnd anywhere that won't cause a lawsuit to stay quiet; you better believe in not saying shit during a medical emergency. My license and livelihood isn't worth it if you sue me because you're an idiot and I try to help.", "NTA for either part. You\u2019re oath does not count for when you are not on the clock. Helping someone having a medical emergency can actually do more harm to him then good. If something were to go wrong and then they asked for a doctor and he stood up he could be liable if something goes wrong in that situation. I understand I\u2019m all for helping but you have no obligation to just like everyone else in that situation had no obligation to help either", "I'm guessing this is a fake.\n\nGiven the first is sensible, but the second is off the rails from what ANY rational medically trained person would do.\n\nOP, YTA for making shit up.", "Yta not giving friends medical advice? Fine.  You shouldn't.  You arent their pcp.\n\nEmergencies?  Man, you're an ahole for that.  What goes around comes around, dude.", "Ok I can understand being annoyed and refusing to give advice with friends and family asking you to look at their mole or how many burps per day is too many and whatever other inane things they\u2019re asking you in time off but when someone straight up collapses in a restaurant, that\u2019s a horse of a different color and makes YTA", "Free advice?

Totally inappropriate for multiple reasons. \n\nBut you lost me at not helping someone who had collapsed in a restaurant. That is unbelievably HEARTLESS. \n\nWhat if that person was choking or was having an anaphylactic reaction to something they ate?? Are you happy to just sit there calmly eating your meal while their brain is starved of oxygen until the paramedics can get there?? It can't possibly be that you find yourself in that situation SO OFTEN that it's a terrible burden.\n\nLike it or not when you decided to become a medical doctor you also signed up to assist in public when there's a medical emergency. If you can't handle this then perhaps you need to change jobs.", "YTA for the second part. \n\nOn vacation  a few years ago, a man was discovered floating with his snorkel gear on. \n\nThe number of doctors and nurses who worked on that man for 20-30 minutes before the ambulance came- man.

CPR, AED, epi pens to try that- every single one of them stopped what they were doing on the beach in the USVI to try to save a stranger. \n\nUnfortunately, he still passed away- but not for lack of trying. \n\nFYI- never snorkel with a full face mask. They aren\u2019t safe.", "N T A for not answering people\u2019s medical questions all the time.

You are entitled to that leeway.\n\nThis applies to both scenario, as someone put it above.\nYou are not privy to the medical history of those asking you for free medical advice. In case you reply with an advice, it may backfire or pave way for a lawsuit or other legal issues.\nFor example, prescribing a medicine, when the other person is deathly allergic. Hospitals take detailed history, if I'm not wrong. If it's a two minute general conversation, I find it hard to believe to know a history of a patient unless in a hospital or medical setting.\n\nAs for emergencies, the same does apply. Paramedics have a set way of responding to emergencies, if you are not trained for that, it's better not to respond as that may cause more harm than good. This may also have other liabilities attached.\n\nIn essence, if the practitioner isn't comfortable providing care, it is unethical to force them to do so as this may cause more harm than good.\n\nHowever, the justification you gave for not responding to an emergency is just.. cruel, for lack of a better word.", "YTA while I get you are tired you are a medical professional.

You're not under any obligation to give free medical advice and it could be irresponsible as you don't know their medical history.\n\nHowever, when there's an emergency situation and staff specifically ask if there are any medical personnel and you ignore it and keep eating your meal?  Major AH.  You may not have a legal obligation but you have a moral obligation.  How often does this actually happen?  Probably not very often.

But this little Reddit commenter doesn\u2019t think you are\u2026 for THAT reason. \n\nHOWEVER, if you are a doctor, I imagine (or really, sincerely hope) you have some level of passion for helping people and saving people\u2019s lives. I don\u2019t see how you could have that level of passion (to go to school for however many years you had to, plus residency, etc) and watch someone collapse and have no urge to help them. Ima be honest.. I think that sounds straight up inhumane. \n\nLet me put it this way:\nYou watch someone collapse and pretend you don\u2019t know how to help them, even though you KNOW you do. Because no one came to that person\u2019s aide and maybe emergency responders couldn\u2019t get there fast enough, that person dies. Would you be able to live with that? Would you be able to say \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get anywhere near that!\u201d I think if your answer is yes\u2026 maybe you shouldn\u2019t be a doctor. \n\nI get you didn\u2019t sign up to provide free medical care 24/7, which is why I get not wanting to answer people\u2019s questions anymore and establishing that boundary.

For the past several months I have been increasingly asked by family, friends, friends of friends for medical advice. Sometimes I\u2019ll be out with my girlfriend and people we meet up with will ask me medical questions.  I\u2019ve been getting more and more annoyed with this. I work hard and during my time off I feel I shouldn\u2019t have to do this.  Finally the other day I cracked. One of my girlfriend\u2019s friends asked me for advice and I just flat out said \u201cask your doctor.\u201d She goes but you\u2019re a doctor. And I said I\u2019m not your doctor. Later my girlfriend said her friend was annoyed that I wouldn\u2019t help her. I told her simply that I have no obligation to help her and I enjoy my time off not thinking about medicine. She understood and was more just relaying a message. \n\nThis also carries over to medical emergencies. I was at a nice restaurant recently enjoying a meal with my girlfriend after a string of shifts at the hospital. I was enjoying some well deserved time off. Someone a few tables over collapsed and the restaurant asked if there was any medical staff. I simply carried on with my meal and ignored them as I knew if I had gotten up to help it would\u2019ve ruined my evening and I would\u2019ve been salty later. \n\nAITA? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m obligated to be a source of free medical services 24/7.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I call bullshit.", "NTA for getting frustrated with answering medical questions outside of work. On the second part, I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but I don\u2019t agree. \n\nBoth my parents work in the medical field one is a doctor one is a nurse. I don\u2019t think I could look at them the same way if they refused to help in a medical emergency and they had the skills to do it. Now, my mom is older and has other health issues. Would I expect her to jump down and do CPR today? Probably not. If she didn\u2019t feel comfortable, then I\u2019d be fine. Again, you are right that it is your time off, and you raised concerns about what could happen to your reputation if something went wrong, despite good Samaritan laws. I just don\u2019t know if I could even look at myself in the mirror, if I turned away, and there\u2019s some thing I could do in an emergency. I am not a healthcare professional, but I\u2019ve taken basic first aid classes.", "First part? My physician dad would say \"OK, take your clothes off and let's take a look.\"\n\nSecond part? My physician dad would and did render any aid he could during his 40-year career. He knew what to look for and what to be concerned about and what to do until EMTs arrived. Sure, lots of times there isn't a lot that a doctor can do in that situation, but they know a lot more than the teacher pipe fitter at the next table. YTA", "YTA", "Info: When's the last time you actually read your Hippocratic oath??", "YTA for your response in an emergency. Not because of any oath you took or whatever. But because not everyone *can* intervene in an emergency, and you can, so you should. Full stop. If it inconveniences you to this degree to have to help someone in an emergency, you\u2019re burned out and you need to make a change. Becoming this desensitized to life and death situations isn\u2019t healthy in any circumstances. \n\nNTA for your response to freeloading friends though. That\u2019s so stupid of them to even ask. You definitely shouldn\u2019t have to give out free advice; they\u2019re just being lazy. I used to work at 911 dispatch, and when people only want to talk about your work after hours it\u2019s exhausting. However, if there\u2019d been an emergency outside of work that I had any capability to help in, it would\u2019ve been an indicator of a serious problem on my end if I wasn\u2019t willing to because it would \u201cruin my night\u201d.\n\nEdit to correct a spelling error", "I think it\u2019s a compromise. And also hard to compare due to it being a U.S. poster.\n\nI\u2019m in the UK. Not a physician but in healthcare and know enough to know the system is flawed so, I do what I can to help family and close friends to advocate for themselves and navigate the system. I get annoyed if they don\u2019t ask because I can usually save them time and the system money which is, being publicly funded, important and part of my job and national welfare/priority.\n\nIn the US people ask so they can avoid having to pay crazy money. Set a boundary in your head of those you don\u2019t mind helping, I.e. just partner and family, or even just partner, send the rest to their own physician or pharmacist. The issues are usually acute but mild niggles or chronic and fed up ones. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to send them away for your own work-life balance and mental health. Cite that you\u2019re uncomfortable not knowing their history, don\u2019t want to advise incorrectly etc rather than off clock.\n\nIn an acute emergency though, where preservation of life is an issue, I think you have a duty of care to step in.", "YTA, maybe one day you\u2019ll have a heart attack and the doc nearby won\u2019t help cause they can\u2019t be fucked", "Yeah - YTA, definitely for the  emergency piece. What an ass. I wasn't thinking this is fake until you felt the need to say it wasn't fake. You are like Angela Lansbury, everywhere you go there is an emergency. Quite odd. And not anyone can do CPR, most people aren't trained and of those that are, most of those have never actually done it so they would likely do it incorrectly. I would expect a Dr to know that. \n\nAlso - people get asked about their work expertise outside of work by friends and family all the time. I worked for a fruity tech company and everyone always asks me about products and tech support. My friend works mobility and folks always reach out to them when anyone they know has an injury. My mechanic friend? Yep, always being asked about things wrong with folks cars or car buying advice.", "YTA- okay the free consults at a social gathering and the constant friends and family members bothering you on your day off instead of making an appointment to see someone like everyone else? That's rude of them. It's bad form to ask and you're well within your rights to tell them to leave you alone.\n\nBut if you didn't want to help people in a medical crisis, like at the restaurant, why did you become a doctor? That's your oath as a physician. I also like to think it's what we do as people. What we owe to each other. When you have the power to help someone and they truly need it, you should help.\n\nHonestly you sound very burnt out. It happens to people in helping professions all the time. Take a vacation. Stay home, make yourself soup, get some quality rest. Treat yourself like you're sick and don't go back to work until you feel better. Take care of yourself.", "NTA on #1 but VERY AH on the 2nd.\n\nMy best friend is a pediatrician and has been in similar situations, one of which I was there for.\n\nFor #1 I agree...there is alot of factors and you don't know or have access to her history and charts so giving advice would be irresponsible \n\nFor #2 ya you're the AH big time. Would you have been comfortable if that person died because you wanted to finish your lunch? I was out to dinner about a year ago with the aforementioned friend and an adult had an emergency. She jumped up to help and kept the person stable and safe until the medics came. I then drove her to the hospital they were being sent to so she could consult with the ER doctor and give the full story. Was our lunch cold and ruined? Absolutely. But someone else lived to see many more lunches and that was worth it 1000x over. Ignoring people in need in public places because you're off the clock is the makings of a really shitty doctor.", "Info: why should anyone here tell you if you're an AH or not? Why are you asking for stranger advice when (hopefully) it's not our job and we ain't on the clock? Hypocritical of you to be asking someone to do what you're too... whatever you are to do yourself.\n\nYou're a big adult. Figure yourself out.", "NTA you have every right to enjoy your down time. I get why people are annoyed you didn\u2019t help in the restaurant but I also get that you\u2019ll be frustrated and burned out if you work 24:7. Not many jobs out there are like a doctor or nurse where you have to respond all the time.  If we haven\u2019t walked in your shoes we don\u2019t get to be irritated with you. Just bc you took an oath doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t actually be \u201c off the clock\u201d when you want.  I would say it would be hard for me to ignore someone in need but I don\u2019t live your life.", "You sound exhausted and burned out. And you\u2019re very right that you aren\u2019t \u201ctheir\u201d doctor. Ok to say that you can\u2019t give advice snd dont want to. Lawyers and dentists and a lot of other people also get the, \u201chey, just a quick question\u201d routine, too. Nope, you\u2019re off duty. \nI can\u2019t say what\u2019s the right thing to do re:cpr or helping in an emergency. Once upon a time, MD\u2019s and others had an obligation, dont know if that\u2019s the case now. If you fell over, you\u2019d probably want someone to compress your chest instead of going on with their \u201cnice\u201d dinner. \nBut free advice to everyone who wants to bend your ear - no, you\u2019re right, go see your own doctor.", "YTA due only to the second scenario.  You'd rather watch someone choke, seize, maybe die, than help them because you're off the clock?

While \"anyone\" can do CPR, not everyone has first aid training, and no one person has the stamina to do CPR long term, so additional bodies that CAN DO CPR IN THE CORRECT FASHION are critical. I'm not a medical professional, but even I would step up to say I have first aid training. And furthermore, unless they're being swarmed with responding doctors and nurses, do your civic duty and step the heck up.\n\nIt's disappointing that someone has to tell you that your dinner is NOT more important than a medical emergency.", "NTA about the advice, people should respect your boundaries. \n\nHowever, I feel like there are two possibilities with the emergencies in public. Sure, you could be one of those doctors who is incredibly talented but has no ability to empathise. If this is so, YTA. I think you have a moral obligation to help. \n\nThe alternative is that you also could be experiencing burnout and depression or another mental health issue associated with your job. Only you know this, but I don\u2019t think your reactions to these health emergencies are healthy or normal. If this is the case, I hope you\u2019re able to get some help and support.", "YTA for not helping in emergencies. God forbid, it interrupts your meal.

Every citizen could be asked to court, but they are more strict on doctors. \n\nI mean as a doctor you made an oath to save lives ignoring a person in need of help is the shittiest thing you could do.", "The state I live in, if you're a licensed medical professional and someone needs help, (ie an accident victim on the road, choking in a restaurant, heart attack in the airport) you are required by law to stop and help.\n\nFor the first part, I agree, you are under no obligation to help. \n\nBut for part two, YTA. You want to fully relax? Hang out at home where no one can intrude on your peace. Otherwise, being in pubic with the ability to provide immediate care and not doing so is cold and cruel. Start the process, then hand it off to the EMTs.", "I definitely think that you need to explain the risks to your practice and whatever friends come to you for random advice. you could make a recommendation that has poor results/severe allergic reaction/who knows what could happen. People do this to everyone even tangentially related to the medical field, and it\u2019s not ok. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re out of line to maintain a boundary between your work and your private life. Everyone else gets to feign ignorance off the clock. NTA", "A vacationing doctor saved my idiot friend when he fell.  The doctor held a tourniquet for the few minutes it took the ambulance to get there.", "This. You don\u2019t have to give free advice, but you made a vow to do no harm and someone could\u2019ve died because you ignored them. \n\nWhen I was 24, my mom and I took my grandma to lunch and she started choking and collapsed unconscious on the floor. As we screamed for someone to call 9-1-1, some off-duty EMTs who were eating two tables over jumped up and started working on her; they literally brought her back to life. I thank god every day they were there. If you had been there instead I would\u2019ve lost my grandma. My mom would\u2019ve lost her mother. Do better.", "This^\n\nCocktail medicine is not the vibe, and the people you\u2019re close to should know boundaries. For those beyond that, unless it\u2019s an emergency situation or you\u2019re just in the mood to chat it out (which, for every medical professional I know, is not often lol), it\u2019s more of a liability than it\u2019s worth to give medical advice with no documentation or follow up and no guarantee they\u2019ll really understand and remember what you actually said.\n\nFor the restaurant? Do you actually hate people? This is disturbing. I\u2019m not in the medical field, but each of my closest friends since childhood (so, going on 30 years) has parents who are doctors and is in the medical field. Planes, restaurants\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen them turn down helping someone who needs it because it inconveniences them. \n\nThe night of my best friend\u2019s white coat ceremony everyone was waiting outside thinking they were using the bathroom on the way out after dinner. Nope. Mama doctor, dad doctor, and daughter (future) doctor were all assisting someone who collapsed as they walked out. The minutes between EMS arriving and someone getting help can literally mean life or death. I hope to god I never have a doctor with this mindset because I can only imagine how it will evolve to \u201csomeone else will catch x issue/ I didn\u2019t make that incorrect note in their chart, so it\u2019s not MY problem.\u201d\n\nGood luck, I hope you can really take to heart the difference between using your skills to make a difference in an emergency and telling people you don\u2019t want to look at their mole during happy hour.", "Ehh, the problem with thinking that doctors are responsible to help in any emergency is scope of practice. \n\nYes they know CPR. But that's about it when it comes to acting in an emergency. \n\nThey are humans with very specific training for acting in a hospital or office setting. Outside of that setting they are just people and are not trained as first responders. \n\nDoctors are trained to respond to in hospital emergencies with all the drugs and equipment that entails. \n\nSince none of that is available, a doctor is just another CPR certified bystander in that situation.", "Even on the advice I think he\u2019s TA. As far as strangers go, he just shouldn\u2019t tell them what he does. But for friends, unless they\u2019re seriously abusing the privilege, just answer.

It is not.
