I found this out at age 16, but nothing in our family\u2019s dynamic changed and it\u2019s not something we really speak about.\n\nMy boyfriend \u201cDan\u201d (together 1 year) found this out over Christmas (we visited my family) and has since been really weird about it. \n\nHe says that first and foremost he\u2019s mad I never told him. I don\u2019t see why it would matter, but he says it\u2019s something you would normally share with a partner after being together as long as we have and he didn\u2019t think we had secrets. I don\u2019t think this is a secret or even an omission, it\u2019s not some dark family history that you get told once you take an oath, it\u2019s an ancillary bit of info that is either relevant or not. No one treats M any differently now that we know (and my dad always knew and didn\u2019t care), so why would I go around advertising it? \n\nDan says he looks at my relationship with M totally differently now. He says he feels a bit weird about how he\u2019s observed us behaving now that he knows we\u2019re not even related (we are NOT Folger\u2019s siblings so idek what he\u2019s talking about). He says there\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s wondering if I didn\u2019t tell him so that it would make our \u201clack of boundaries\u201d less of a red flag. \n\nDan is not a jealous or controlling person I\u2019m the slightest, so this has me quite shocked. He seems really hurt and worried about it and I\u2019m wondering if this is a big deal and I\u2019m just desensitised because it\u2019s my own situation? \n\nMy mother has warned me about being close with M being a red flag to guys so I\u2019m now second guessing if it really does look from the outside like I was hiding it? \n\nThe reaction is so out of character for Dan I\u2019m really starting to feel like I messed up but at the same time, I also don\u2019t get why it\u2019s a big deal that we don\u2019t share blood?\n\n*edit because I saw a few people asking about what my mother said. She\u2019s a bit conservative so I think she\u2019s overreacting but this whole thing just reminded me. She mentioned it at a time when M and I were living together, and she said men might be uncomfortable because we\u2019re roommates, and M is protective of me. We also have matching tattoos, which my mother says is weird (but she also just hates that I have a tattoo so I don\u2019t take that too seriously) and that he gave me a Cartier love bracelet that I wear all the time. Also he apparently has a habit of touching my neck that she finds weird (I say \u201capparently\u201d because yes he does this sometimes to steer me in a crowded room or a signal if we\u2019re in social situations the same way you would nudge someone under the table to get their attention, but I don\u2019t consider it a \u201chabit\u201d)* \n\n*Edit 2 - when Dan said \u201clack of boundaries\u201d he just means I tell M a lot of things and ask for his advice a lot. He does the same with me. It\u2019s not related to anything physical* \n\n*For anyone asking how we were meant to be related - My dad presented M as the son from his short lived marriage to his ex (M is 9 years older than me), so we thought we were half siblings. Turns out his mother and my father had separated by the time he was conceived but my dad went along with M being his \u201cson\u201d because he wanted a child.*", "created_utc": 1703852859, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tm1nc/aita_for_not_telling_my_boyfriend_my_brother_and/", "score": 1290, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My brother also resides on the same property as me (in a separate house, but is literally steps away). As the older sibling, I try to ensure that he isn't struggling too hard. He has a gf, and I am getting married in May, and neither are bothered by it. I think most people voting y t a probably just don't have any siblings or don't have a good bond with them.

It's also worth mentioning that our partners also have siblings and agree this is normal sibling behavior.
