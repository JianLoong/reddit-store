I found this out at age 16, but nothing in our family\u2019s dynamic changed and it\u2019s not something we really speak about.\n\nMy boyfriend \u201cDan\u201d (together 1 year) found this out over Christmas (we visited my family) and has since been really weird about it. \n\nHe says that first and foremost he\u2019s mad I never told him. I don\u2019t see why it would matter, but he says it\u2019s something you would normally share with a partner after being together as long as we have and he didn\u2019t think we had secrets. I don\u2019t think this is a secret or even an omission, it\u2019s not some dark family history that you get told once you take an oath, it\u2019s an ancillary bit of info that is either relevant or not. No one treats M any differently now that we know (and my dad always knew and didn\u2019t care), so why would I go around advertising it? \n\nDan says he looks at my relationship with M totally differently now. He says he feels a bit weird about how he\u2019s observed us behaving now that he knows we\u2019re not even related (we are NOT Folger\u2019s siblings so idek what he\u2019s talking about). He says there\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s wondering if I didn\u2019t tell him so that it would make our \u201clack of boundaries\u201d less of a red flag. \n\nDan is not a jealous or controlling person I\u2019m the slightest, so this has me quite shocked. He seems really hurt and worried about it and I\u2019m wondering if this is a big deal and I\u2019m just desensitised because it\u2019s my own situation? \n\nMy mother has warned me about being close with M being a red flag to guys so I\u2019m now second guessing if it really does look from the outside like I was hiding it? \n\nThe reaction is so out of character for Dan I\u2019m really starting to feel like I messed up but at the same time, I also don\u2019t get why it\u2019s a big deal that we don\u2019t share blood?\n\n*edit because I saw a few people asking about what my mother said. She\u2019s a bit conservative so I think she\u2019s overreacting but this whole thing just reminded me. She mentioned it at a time when M and I were living together, and she said men might be uncomfortable because we\u2019re roommates, and M is protective of me. We also have matching tattoos, which my mother says is weird (but she also just hates that I have a tattoo so I don\u2019t take that too seriously) and that he gave me a Cartier love bracelet that I wear all the time. Also he apparently has a habit of touching my neck that she finds weird (I say \u201capparently\u201d because yes he does this sometimes to steer me in a crowded room or a signal if we\u2019re in social situations the same way you would nudge someone under the table to get their attention, but I don\u2019t consider it a \u201chabit\u201d)* \n\n*Edit 2 - when Dan said \u201clack of boundaries\u201d he just means I tell M a lot of things and ask for his advice a lot. He does the same with me. It\u2019s not related to anything physical* \n\n*For anyone asking how we were meant to be related - My dad presented M as the son from his short lived marriage to his ex (M is 9 years older than me), so we thought we were half siblings. Turns out his mother and my father had separated by the time he was conceived but my dad went along with M being his \u201cson\u201d because he wanted a child.*", "created_utc": 1703852859, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tm1nc/aita_for_not_telling_my_boyfriend_my_brother_and/", "score": 1802, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My brother also resides on the same property as me (in a separate house, but is literally steps away). As the older sibling, I try to ensure that he isn't struggling too hard. He has a gf, and I am getting married in May, and neither are bothered by it. I think most people voting y t a probably just don't have any siblings or don't have a good bond with them.

But here\u2019s my relationship with my sister. \n\nWe have a 4 year difference and we\u2019re in our 30s. We grew up sharing a room. We still hold hands occasionally while walking in crowded areas, something we\u2019ve been doing since we\u2019re kids. I hold her neck at times. Some people do find it weird, but it doesn\u2019t bother us because we grew up close. \n\nWe splurge on each other. Just earlier this year she paid for my airfare (international) and tickets to a concert to a show I want to watch. I also pay for things she likes and I\u2019m the one paying for her PS5 subscription, our Netflix, prime, Disney, Apple Music, etc. \n\nAnd talking about OP\u2019s mother. I\u2019ve had aunts who\u2019ve made faces when I was a 15 year old child and when I rested my head and had a nap on my 20 year old male cousin\u2019s shoulder. They sexualised everything we did. Meanwhile this cousin lost his mom pretty early on and my mom was a mother to him. We went to the movies and restaurants together. My mom used to specifically plan trips to the zoo to involve him, because he had no one else to take him anywhere. My aunts saw me sleeping on his shoulder and made big deal about it. My parents went no contact with these aunts for their disgusting attitude towards me and my cousin. \n\nAlso, I guess it all boils down to culture as well. Americans seem to be very iffy about being affectionate with their family members. Everything OP mentioned is a very typical sibling relationship to me.", "I have four siblings, two of whom are technically my half siblings, and two of whom are technically step siblings, but we were all raised as siblings from such a young age, that the level of blood relationship is absolutely meaningless, we are all siblings regardless.\n\nAdditionally, one of my good friends and her brother are adopted, they were both adopted as babies, her brother is two years younger than her, they have no blood relationship, but they are siblings, and behave just like any other siblings. \n\nIt's sad and a little creepy that some people seem to think that non-blood related individuals can't be close to each other without it insinuating something inappropriate or potentially sexual.", "There have been studies that suggest incest is actually more psychological than biological. People raised as siblings from a young age will have basically 0 attraction to each other, regardless of blood relation.", "Not wanting to deal with it is a valid reason to end the relationship - but it still doesn't make OP wrong to not explicitly mention that the brother she was raised with her entire life is not biologically related. Honestly - I can't imagine it even comes up in OP's mind often because *why would it?* That's just 'her brother.'", "I know one long term couple who were step-siblings from a young age. 30+ years of marriage now. So BF's concerns do have some factual foundation. OP should explore origins of BF attitudes; is there more to worry about? What value system does BF have and is it really compatible with hers? NAH, yet.", "Thank you, I do my best!\n\nTo be fair though, OP has commented that her friends have received similar from their parents so perhaps it is normal in her and her brother's social circles to give this as a gift? Or perhaps she specifically asked for one from someone and so he got it for her? Just food for thought, I know nothing for certain as we only have one POV from OP and things could have been omitted or embellished.", "And that's likely more of a red flag from him than it is from her!", "Yeah but what is \"to close\" to ur step / adopted / not blood related sibling??? \n\nLike unless they have a weird totally not normal relationship with each other I don't see a problem? \n\nIf they seemed normal as blood related siblings why is it weird as not blood related siblings????", "If it was due to him seeing too much incest porn, he would have been bothered by them having a close relationship to begin with.

This seems like sibling behavior to me\u2026.I buy gifts for my siblings, I live with them under one roof (like a roommate?). And if you mean the \u201cneck touching\u201d thing, siblings normally have quirks like that. My siblings and I had a secret handshake, I still grab onto their hoods when walking through a crowd to stay connected. I *gasp* hug my siblings. And the whole \u201clack of boundaries\u201d thing. If this was two sisters that had an awesome sister-supporting-sister relationship, nobody would say thats weird. But I guess a brother and sister can\u2019t be close\u2026?\n\nI brought up \u201cadopted siblings\u201d because I feel like if it was phrased that way, no one would have an issue right?

And like OP said this isn't even a secret its just one of those things.", "Exactly.

Besides, he\u2019s the one who accepted M as a son and he\u2019d probably provide some helpful advice from a different perspective? Maybe you can present the situation to him, he\u2019s more familiar with what\u2019s normal in the family dynamics than us (the internet) \n\nIf you have any paternal uncles, have you considered asking them what the f- is up with M and why your mom is weird about the dynamic?

They know from the go that they aren\u2019t blood related.  unless they were babies when the parents got together, and the other parents and their families aren\u2019t involved, so they were never told.

Unless she is into incest, her mind is not going to change about them being brother and sister.", "Honestly to me that's just a control thing. A long time ago when I was young and naive I dated a man who asked me to tell him all of my secrets. I trusted him so I did. Then later on he became controlling and abusive and tried to use the secrets (they were about my childhood abuse) against me.

OP says she didn't know they weren't related until she was 16.", "Plenty of half siblings live apart and see themselves as full siblings. I do, my partner does.

I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re any less close because of it, but still fuckin weird to a lot of people to omit it.

That maybe while YOU don't think of your brother as anything but a brother, maybe HE sees you in a different light? Why aren't you concerned about that? I'm very confused about this actually, you keep on defending everything with not an ounce of consideration that maybe people have a point and at least fucking look into it, have a talk, start paying attention if your brother doesn't do other inappropriate things, or ask your mom or your bf what inappropriate behaviours they noticed, since you clearly don't exactly have objective view of the situation.\n\nIf you just came here for validation then fuck off.

It costs about what I paid for my current (used) car. That's a pretty extravagant gift.

You also need to understand that for most people that bracelet is quite the expensive gesture of love.\n\nThe neck touching is what makes it weird for me. I have 3 siblings and the last time one of them reached for my neck we were much younger and it was our version of Thunderdome. We get along well as adults, give each other reasonable, modest gifts for birthdays and Christmas, and have appropriate, affectionate physical contact, like hugs. If my brother is trying to steer me in a crowd he touches my shoulder.\n\nI think you need to listen to the many people in your life that are telling you the relationship looks strange from the outside and seriously consider what they are saying.

The website likes to sell them as permanent jewellery but it\u2019s a marketing gimmick, I\u2019ve unscrewed mine myself.
