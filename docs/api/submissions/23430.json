This is 100% not your fault. It may be thanks to you that she's now free of a homophobic asshole, so take credit if you'd like, but not blame. NTA", "NTA. She's sad because the guy she thought was so nice is homophobic and started throwing insults at **her** brother, in **her** house, **behind** her back. He showed his true colors. She'll get over him. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has standards.  And she knows she can do better than someone who is cruel to her sibling.\n\nYes, she may be sad about the situation.  She badly misjudged her ex-boyfriend's character.  She invested her time and energy into a relationship that turned out to be with someone who's a homophobic AH. Those are things that it is normal to feel sad about.\n\nBut lying to cover for him wouldn't change his character, and would only postpone her discovery of who he is.  Such truths make themselves known, eventually.  And it's better she learns the truth now, before they're married or have a child, and she's tied to him forever. \n\nOffer to take her out to dinner, your treat, just the two of you.  Someplace nice. Talk to her, not about how you're sorry you exposed information that ended the relationship, but about how you're sorry that she's in pain from having things wind up this way.  Let her know you're grateful to know she has your back.", "NTA. You didn't ruin her relationship. The homophobe did. He called you hateful slurs when she wasn't in earshot. Wonder what else he was doing behind her back.", "NTA. Your sister made the decision not to be with a homophobe. You did nothing wrong.  \n\nThis is why people need to get to know each other before committing or marrying. It takes time for situations to present themselves and for people to see how their SO reacts.", "NTA.\n\nHave you considered that she is sad because she felt she was lied to by her ex for over a year about his true feelings? That she's sad because she was deceived into believing she'd found a partner that would get along with her family and that turned out to not be the case?\n\nYes, she's sad she broke up because the thing she thought she had, she didn't really have. To her, it's probably not all that different from being cheated on because trust was broken.", "NTA - you did not cause the breakup. Her AH ex-boyfriend did. But its great news that she dumped him. Your sister will be better off without him and will eventually find a great guy who will be accepting of you. \n\nShe probably would have dumped him eventually.  Her friends aren't very good friends if they continue to blame you. Of course your sister is sad - no matter the reason, it can take a while to get over a relationship. Now that she sees him for who he really is, she can't believe that she allowed herself to invest an entire year with the jerk.", "NTA. The guy ruined the relationship by being a homophobe. Your sister would\u2019ve realised it sooner or later.", "NTA. His homophobia is not your fault. And it would have come out sooner or later anyway so you may have done your sister a favour.", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t cause the break-up, he did.  Of course she\u2019s sad he revealed himself to be an unabashed homophobe, but it\u2019s far better that she learn it now than when she\u2019s even more invested in the relationship.  You did the right thing by telling her.", "NTA youve literally done nothing wrong here.\n\nIm about as straight as they come but my friend group consists of 99% people in the LGBTQ+ community. I am the \"token cis straight guy\" in my group. I support, I stand for them. Y'all need the support and acceptance.\n\nYour sister obviously realizes that and chose to side with you and stand by you.\n\nThis is something for you to be happy about. Express your love and thankfulness for your sister. Family stands with family, allies stand with their crew.\n\nThink of it this way: you helped your sis dodge a bullet.", "NTA\nit is good that you were honest with your sister so that she could make an informed decision about her relationship. I wonder how well he must've acted till now to keep his real personality from her. You don't need to feel guilty. What if they had a kid years from now and he discovered the kid is gay?", "NTA and good on your sister for kicking that guy to the curb for the way he treated you... but wow are your sister's friends major AHs. They're really sticking up for the homophobic boyfriend here?", "NTA.", "NTA, your sister decided for herself that she didn't want to be in a relationship with someone who makes her brother feel unsafe. It was better that she found out now that the boyfriend is homophobic, ignore her friends as it has nothing to do with them and you did nothing wrong. \n\nMay I suggest you and your sister go out for a nice meal together if it fits in with your budget. You've got a great sister.", "NTA.\n\nShe asked and you answered.\n\nMaybe she will miss the BF enough to reengage with him and try to educate his bigotry away with patience and reason. Who knows?\n\nI wouldn't myself. But perhaps she has an evangelical streak and diplomatic abilities.", "NTA. If anything you have done her a favour by exposing how much of an AH he is before she wasted any more time on him.", "NTA. I'm my experience people who are homophobic are usually less progressive on things like women's rights as well. So eventually I would bet this guy would not treat your sister right. He revealed himself to you, and it's good that you told your sister so she could make an informed decision about her future.", "NTA. Your sister is sad, I'm sure, because even homophobes have good qualities as well. My guess is, she doesn't want to share her sadness with you because she doesn't want you to feel guilty. This isn't your fault at all - the relationship was doomed because they had opposing values and you were unfortunately part of the catalyst. But if it weren't about you being gay, the ex-bf's homophobia would have slipped out eventually in some other instance and your sister would have dumped him then. \n\nHer friends are being assholes imo. This isn't about you and if they want to support your sister they should support her decisions to take out the bigoted trash. If you feel comfortable I would share what they said with your sister so she can reassure you herself and you two can cheer each other up.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU did not ruin her relationship. Her finding out her bf was an homophobic AH ruined the relationship.", "100% NTA, you left to avoid a scene, told your sister only when asked, you didnt cause anything, he did by being homophobic", "NTA. You didn't ruin her relationship by letting her know what he's really like. He ruined it by exposing his hatefulness to you. She had a right to know the truth. It was then up to her to decide whether he could adequately explain why he behaved that way. You helped her, the truth would eventually have come out and he's probably a total AH in many other ways as well.", "NTA. First of all, you didn\u2019t cause the break up, he did, your sister probably didn\u2019t know who he really was. Second, she has really bad friends if they want her to still be with a man like that! She was happy because she really didn\u2019t knew this side of him. Third, he insulted you! Her brother! If my partner insulted my little brother he would be history.", "NTA.  You both did the right thing", "NTA \n\nYou didn't break them up. The dude was homophobic and attacked her sibling. You were honest as you should've been. She saw the red flag and cut that shit off immediately. Her friends are honestly disgusting that they see his behavior as acceptable", "HE ruined their relationship, and she is lucky to be rid of him. Look at it this way: thanks to you, she escaped a life spent with a bigot. And not just a bigot, but a bigot who cared so little about her that he would abuse her brother for no reason. Good riddance, and you should give yourself a pat on the back. And when others blame you, ask them, \"You'd rather my sister be with an insufferable bigot?\"", "NTA. And tell your sister that her friends are supporting the homophobe.", "NTA. First of all, you didn\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d her do anything. She\u2019s a grown woman who made an informed decision based on the information she was presented with. And if I were her, I\u2019d much rather know of my partner were using the f-slur to my family than be kept in the dark. She made the right choice, and you did nothing wrong.", "He can fuck off and her friends can fuck off too. Do they expect you to take this fools bullshit and smile? Sit there and be insulted and berated for who you are and who you love? \n\nYour sister is right. This isn'tyour fault, it was all that asshole.\n\nShe might need to clean house with some of those asshole friends too.\n\nEasy NTA", "NTA. With his attitude, it was only a matter of time. It\u2019s better sooner than later.", "Nta. Of course. Also THAT F word is a vile slur. Sorry that happened to you. \n\nBut I actually have SO many questions if you don't mind answering (the answers to these don't change my view btw-  he was out of order):  \n\n1) in the year that was dating was he ever like this before, or ever give off just a vibe? \n\n2) did any dispute or something happen before this? Or was he literally all nice and when she left suddenly and then randomly turn (both are terrible...but the second would actually be so creepy) \n\nAnd just a side note, I know you think he made her happy... but it was probably a superficial (from his part). Anybody that actually loved their partner wouldn't treat their loved ones like this regardless of their (horrible) views.", "NTA. No normal person wants to be in a relationship with someone who would act that way to *anyone*, much less their own brother. \n\nI\u2019m guessing she\u2019s upset with herself for not knowing his true character sooner, and breakups are always sad no matter the reason. \n\nI agree with the suggestion to take her out for dinner!", "Fellow member of the queer community here, and you're NTA, OP. If your sister is sad about the breakup, it's most likely because she's sad that she misjudged his character and put you in that position in the first place. Don't feel guilty. You did the right thing telling her about what he did. \n\nYou sister loves you so much that she not only listened when you explained what happened, but truly HEARD you. She took what you said, recognized a threat to your health and safety, and removed the problem. She proved she loves and supports you and truly wants you to know that she is a safe person to be around. You're truly blessed with such a supportive big sister.\n\nIf you're still really concerned about this, however, then I suggest maybe inviting her out for a sibling day. Get coffee, hang out, check in. If she asks why, let her know what her friends said, and also tell her how you feel about the whole thing. Remind her that you're not trying to dictate her life, but you just want to be honest and open with her, and that you love and appreciate her and what her to be happy. \n\nOP, you're a good lad. Take a moment and treat yourself to a nice snack and something you like to watch and decompress. You'll figure things out. Just give yourself time. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful day.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't cause your sister to break up....her (ex)bf homophobia did.", "NTA.\nYour sister needed to know that her bf treated you this way. Can you imagine future family gatherings where you'd have to deal with this on a regular basis?", "NTA - She is sad because she thought she had a loving wonderful boyfriend, and has found out 1 horrible thing about him that means she no longer trusts him as a good person.\n\nShe is mourning the person she thought he was, but now knows he is not.", "NTA.\n\nAnd your sister is my hero.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin her relationship. Her ex ruined it by revealing his assholery.", "NTA. Your sister made the decision, not you. He ruined the relationship, not you. Good for her for standing up for you.", "She\u2019s sad because she loved the person she thought he was, not the person who actually existed. She probably feels tricked or cheated by her ex for deceiving her into believing he was a good person. That\u2019s not on you. That\u2019s him hurting your sister by lying to her about who he is.", "NTA Tell her about what her friends said too.

Not accepting the lifestyle of their loved ones would be a deal breaker.  No signs he was/is homophobic?", "NTA. The only person whose feelings matter here, other than your own, is your sister. All her supposed friends are letting her down if they think they can speak and feel on her behalf. You didn\u2019t cause the break up, your sister\u2019s boyfriend did. \n\nEven though it is normal to put your kids and partner first, partners also need to be respectful. She has been a good and supportive sister to you. That is who she is. Being accepting of gender and sexual diversity is part of her values and the standards she sets for her relationships. She is merely enforcing those standards for her own benefit (even if you also benefit). She should be commended for it, not patronised. And you shouldn\u2019t be shamed and ashamed for simply being the catalyst that put this snake into the open. Good riddance and what a relief for the both of you.", "NTA your sister may be super sad because she was dating a homophobe and didn't know it.\n\nI know that would make me sad.\n\nIt's not your fault, and it sounds like your sister has some shitty friends.", "You helped her dodge a bullet.

Also, while she\u2019s getting a new boyfriend, your sister should look at getting some new friends too.", "The only part of this that makes YTA is blaming or trying to blame yourself for them breaking up. Every action has a reaction and he knew how close you guys were and regardless of how he feels about gays (which is his right, he doesn't have to like it) he should have enough respect for you as a human being with feelings and for your sister, someone he probably said he loved to keep his feelings and thoughts to himself. He's the biggest AH in this whole situation, he did this to himself, you did nothing wrong. And I'm sorry he felt entitled to voice his opinions in a place you should have felt safe and he knows he was wrong or he'd have not waited til she left the room. Sounds like a bully to me. Make sure your sister knows you are there for her and that you're proud of her for standing up for herself and you even tho it costed her a relationship. There's no shortage in the global dick supply. Someone better is out there and she will find them. Sorry I rambled. I have a habit of doing that. Ugh.", "So glad OP's sister is a decent human being who stuck up for her sibling. She might want to re-think her friendships as well if they keep harassing OP. OP is NTA for being honest with their sister.", "I agree. Based off of the fact that you describe the relationship with your sister as close your sister is probably more sad about the fact that she trusted someone enough to begin to share life with and that person has caused great harm to her loved one (a brother that she has loved and supported since birth) . She is probably sad about the fact that someone has desecrated her safe space ( both physically by verbally attacking you in her home and mentally/emotionally by threatening the dynamics of her relationship with you) . I could understand your sister struggling to cope with and understand how she failed to recognize/predict that the EX held such abhorrent views and behavior  after they have been dating so long. Or she could be worrying that because she was attracted to this person and believed that they were a compatible match that there is something about herself that attracted someone with such hateful beliefs. There are countless reasons that would cause your sister to be sad after the breakup and not one of them is you so anyone that would suggest such a thing is an ass . It's so refreshing to see someone sacrifice their own temporary happiness in order to give their loved ones unshakable support. This is what people mean when they say love is an action word.", "Exactly. She loved someone who turned out to not exist.", "This.

Perhaps they'd get married.  You'd drift apart from her because you never warmed up to her husband and she didn't understand why.  She was sad about that, but she accepted it... and they had kids.  You never visited unless her husband was away.  Everyone moves on, the kids grow up.\n\n20 years from now, their daughter at 16 informs them... she's a lesbian.  Dude grows ballistic.  It's a side of him that your sister has never seen.  She's horrified.  There's drama and pain and your poor niece... and your sister calls you, tearful and heartbroken.

I didn't want to break you up, so... that's why I didn't say anything.\"\n\nTHAT is a conversation you do not *ever* want to have.  It's good that you told her this now.

If anything, you did her a favor by telling her the truth so she could make a fully informed choice about her future.\n\nShe\u2019s sad because she wasted time with someone who seemed great but turned out to be a homophobic asshole. She wasted time and love and money and trust on someone who turned around and hurt a person she clearly cares a lot about behind her back. \n\nHer friends, I\u2019m sorry, are either assholes or just plain stupid. Yes, she\u2019s sad that what she thought was a good relationship turned out this way. But that was absolutely 100% HIS fault. You were just the messenger. I mean, if the situation were reversed and she told you that someone you were dating started insulting her behind your back in a way that went totally against your personal values, would you feel like she \u201cruined\u201d your relationship?", "NTA\n\nHer friends are the assholes tho. She picked her brother, her family, over her boyfriend, and they\u2019re mad at you? If your sister was my friends, I would try to cheer her up and say that she did the right thing. Or something like that. To think they are trying to put this on you, it\u2019s insane.\n\nAnd think about, if he went after you, what if one of their kids ends up LGBT+? Was he gonna be like that too? \n\nAre her friends stupid? Why aren\u2019t they supporting her?", "NTA, from what happened looks like you sister dodges a bullet", "NTA  \nThis is not your fault. Your sister is coming to terms with the fact that he guy she loved is not the person she thought he was. That's distressing but she's be better off in the end.", "Yes. This. Your sister is allowed to be sad because she has to come to terms with 1. The person she loved was homophobic and hurt her sibling, and 2. She was probably in love. It's going to take time, but this was obviously a decision she stands by. Her friends are blaming the wrong person. You didn't break them up. Her boyfriend did by being shitty.", "Everyone has the right to their opinion regardless of why or what the opinion is about. Does it make it correct? No. Does anyone have the right to throw their opinion around at others? Also no. My point is that it's all our right to feel how we feel about whatever it is we feel. It's not our right to push that on other people tho. So yes I'd say the same thing cuz while it's ridiculous that people are so small minded to dislike a group of people for whatever reason, there's nobody saying they HAVE to like them. Again, it's stupid. I think if you don't like something then just don't do it or be around it. The world is big enough for all of us to live in it. \n\nThanks for the question. \nAnd your edit made me laugh because I posted earlier somewhere and I had to edit 3 times because I used talk to text and well, it let me look really stupid. \ud83d\ude02", ">I think if you don't like something then just don't do it or be around it.\n\nKinda impossible to do when it comes to ppl unless you only plan on living in your house", "You don't have to take part in it is my point. I just woke up, my brain isn't all the way awake. Please forgive me. I'm heading to work, I have double shifts the next 4 days between 3 stores, so I'm sure there will be more posts that I know what I'm trying to say but may not actually word correctly. Just know my intentions are good. \nHave a good night. (Or day, depending where you're at I suppose)", "It's not your fault that her bf is an AH\n\nIt was her choice not to be with a subtier human being. Just try to be extra nice to her, and be honest with her about your feelings. She also needs to know about her friends telling you that you are to blame.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your sister is super sad because her boyfriend *wasn't the man she thought he was.*  She thought he was a great guy but found out he's a homophobic AH and is now mourning the man she thought she had.  Thank God she found this out before she married him (if it got that far).  Ignore her friends, they don't know what your sister is feeling or thinking.", "Better she knows now. You did the right thing.", "NTA! You did her a favor. She would not want to be with someone who treated her beloved brother that way. I don\u2019t know her of course but I guarantee she is grateful you told her this. \n\nThis is the kind of thing decent people (like your sister) want to know about partners. It\u2019s a character flaw. She\u2019s a good person who doesn\u2019t want to be with someone like this. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. Believe her that it isn\u2019t your fault.", "NTA. But send your sister what her friends have been saying to you.", "NTA, where does this end? They get married and he\u2019s homophobic to you for the rest of your life? You are NTA for existing as a gay man (I\u2019m trans and queer FYI). Do not feel guilty, you did her a favor.", "It\u2019s super sad when you find out the guy you\u2019re seeing is a dick. That\u2019s why she\u2019s sad. It\u2019s not your fault. NTA", "I\u2019ll be blunt about it. Your sister is her own person who is capable of making her own decisions. You did not do anything she is allowed to be pissed at her boyfriend, and to break up with her boyfriend for whatever she wants you don\u2019t hold any power in that relationship or her decisions.", "Nta.her friends are shitty u need to tell her what  they are saying"]}
