I offered to throw a bridal shower for her knowing that she doesn't have any friends, and her cousins are boys. She gladly accepted and seemed very happy. \nSo I started planning, I consulted with her on a few details to make sure the event would be to her liking: the decor, colour scheme, games/entertainment etc. And it was agreed that we would have the party at her house, a few streets away. Everything was in order until she finally sent me the guest list of over 40 people!!!  Hosting this amount of people during the pandemic (no restrictions at the time) in a small space seemed impractical to me. So I offered to have the event at my place instead, in order to accomodate all these people (originally we had discussed about 8 -12 guests) I have a large outdoor area with a fireplace, pool and garden and have plenty of extra chairs, tables etc. So nothing would need to be hired and the venue would be free. \nSIL freaked out!!! She insisted that we have the event at her place even after I explained that the space would be far to small for the amount of people on her guest list and attempting to accommodate that amount of people would pose more of a health risk. She insisted so I agreed but I tried to manage her expectations of the event by saying that we wouldn't have enough space to have a photo booth, candy table, champagne bar etc. \n\nShe accused me of making her event about me and saying that I should be doing whatever she wants and not what I want. I just wanted her to have the best celebration possible and felt that I could do that for her if I had the space to make all of my ideas come to life. I also feel that if someone volunteers to do something for you on their dime it should be appreciated regardless.\nAt the end of this conversation she said that maybe it's best if I don't arrange it for her after all. I accepted immediately and said that I really wanted her to be happy and if she preferred someone else to arrange it instead that that would be the best option going forward, and that I will not be involved any further and attend as a guest. And she agreed to this. A few hours passed that day and suddenly she messages me again and apologized for being rude and saying she was just stressed etc. But she really wants me to still plan the party for her so she'll 'let' me do it. I feel that my offer was very gracious and the fact that I opened my home to her and her family was generous, in addition to paying for the event. \n\nBut was I in fact the real the A hole here?", "created_utc": 1695211615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16njllz/aitah_to_offer_my_house_as_a_venue_for_my_sils/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you sure you didn't hijack this from the start? Something doesn't sound right here", "NTA. \n\nIt was lovely of you to offer to throw her the party, and graciously accommodate a much larger gathering than previously agreed upon. \n\nYou were being very practical around space constraints while also trying to mitigate issues around overcrowding. The party sounds like it was quite an elaborate one but as you say in a later post, she is the one who wanted something larger and more extravagant. We could give her the benefit of doubt that perhaps she didn't want to feel upstaged by the event being held in your home, and losing an aspect of control and intimacy? Whatever the reason was, it was quite rude given the effort you went through.", "NTA, and let me say, I would have declined her offer after she was so rude to me.", "DO NOT RENEGE ON BACKING OUT. This will happen over every choice about the party, and you're already free from it. Dont go back. NTA.", "NTA. The size of her guest list dictated a venue change, and your suggestion was reasonable. Hopefully she realizes that now and is sincere in her apology, and you can choose to graciously accept it.\n\nI must admit I may be a bit biased because I once offered to fully host and fund a bridal shower for a family member, spending thousands, plus I rented a special house near where she lived as a venue, and then she presented me with a guest list of over 100 women. I had to explain that was too many people for a bridal shower, and perhaps she could have several showers instead (bride's family, groom's family, friends only.) She eventually relented, and she had two lovely showers, but I always felt she held a grudge about it, which I did not appreciate.", "NTA, and she is going to be a blooming bridzilla.", "This is my take as well. She was being impractical expecting 40 guests inside of a tiny area. And you hear you were offering a bigger area for the amount of gas she decided to spring on you.\n\n\nNta\n\n\nThough personally you wouldn't matter how much she apologized I would not take back over nor would I let them into the house\n\nBut I'm also Petty and also been used way too much so take it as you will", "Never even thought about that part.... she just sent a guest list and out if nowhere 40 people were on it.  Somehow I never got the chance to even be bothered by this part because she started the whole other drama.", "Exactly! That's what I thought. I would love for someone to offer to do this for me. The reason she eventually gave was that her family would feel more comfortable at her house than at mine. Since I wasn't part of 'their' family and they didn't really know me. The event was planned and then cancelled 2 days before because one of her 40 guests arrived from out of town with COVID and stayed at their house exposing the entire household. The event never happened..... she was married  a few weeks later.", "Perfect response thank you I will be using this in the future.... (I ended up planning the event to keep the peace) but I have decided not to host anything for them again.", "She loves all things extravagant the bigger the better, she was consulted at the start on the kind of event she wanted and everything was planned to her liking. I think the thing that triggered her was when I told her it would be impractical to have all those things we had discussed for 40 people in her small garden. \n\nPeople got COVID and the event was cancelled in the end. But the drama of the whole situation left me confused. \n\nThank you so much for your feedback.", "OP didn't insist, SIL insisted, OP just explained there would be far more limitations with a smaller space and expressed concerns about covid - seems pretty rational to me.", "Asian family....", "Asian family.... the people she invited were all family only 2 friends from high school were invited. (She is no longer friends with these two friends due to some other wedding drama that happened between them) \n\nAt the same time to some degree I do think you are right, although I did wait an entire year after their engagement to allow anyone else in her family to volunteer to plan it but no one did..... having said that  I have a tendency to get excited and hijack event planning because it's something  I'm really good at and enjoy doing and seeing the joy on people's faces (usually) when their event comes to life.  I think in future it's best I don't get involved in planning again and just attend their events as a guest. \nThanks so much for your input", "Thank you so much for your feedback. I think you are right on the money she probably wanted it at her home so she could have more control and the party could feel more 'hers' and I had not even considered this I just said more guests equals more space needed and never thought of any other nuances.", "Thank you for this. And I am so sorry to hear of your experience sounds like you planned something amazing for her . I cannot imagine holding a grudge over someone doing something so kind for me.... 100 people is literally insane.", "Dear Karma, \n\nThanks for having OP's back.\n\nLove,\nSisters of OP\n\n>The reason she eventually gave was that her family would feel more comfortable at her house than at mine. Since I wasn't part of 'their' family and they didn't really know me.\n\nHow did they survive attending the wedding?! Was the venue owned by someone in \"their\" family? Why wasn't that offered for the shower to begin with if being in the family is a necessary requirement for participation and attendance?! \n\n(Sarcasm aside, social gatherings are events and sometimes events take place at venues. Sometimes venues are houses. Sometimes when multiple families are involved, venues can be personal locations, such as houses, that one may never have been associated with before and never will be again. That's how social gatherings work. Sheesh...And the sarcasm never got put aside, did it?)", "Ah, then I really don\u2019t understand why she wanted it happening at her place. Oh well. Still, you were definitely not the AH. And blame it on her nerves. Some brides get nuts and have ideas of their own and can\u2019t see beyond them. At least she \u201capologized\u201d in a way.", "And what was even worse is that her mother refused to advise her that 100 people was too many for a shower. \"Whatever she wants,\" was her mother's opinion. And I had to say \"She's young and she doesn't know what's appropriate. It's our job to help explain that to her.\"", "The reason she gave was that her family would feel more comfortable at her place than at mine because I wasn't part of their family.... yes she did apologize however it was only after she realized that no one else would organize it for her and she needed me to do it or she just wouldn't have anything at all. I think you are so right she was fixated on her ideal situation which just unfortunately wasn't practical.", "Exactly this sounds like the same exact situation I had. It was just it's her day her choice whatever she wants without regards to what's practically possible.", "This is so right. That's the only reason she apologized. She suddenly realized that I was her only reliable option. \nThanks for the feedback. I will definitely keep my distance in future.", "NTA.  When did brides start planning their own bridal showers?  I thought the Maid of Honor did that and the bride just showed up.  Anyway, your offer seemed both thoughtful and generous.  Unlike her offer to \"let\" you do it.  You would not be an ass to tell her no at this point.  If you decide to still host the shower, then you would be even more generous.", "NTA. No way. You offered to do her a HUGE favor.", "NTA! But your SIL is a very entitled AH. Good luck having her for SIL for rest of your lives( if marriage even lasts)", "NTA. Why would she want all those people in her place lmao. Does she know that it takes time to set up and clean a place before and after the party right?. Even if she\u2019s not the one who\u2019s gonna clean it, she\u2019s not gonna have the comfort of relaxing after a party when there are people inside her house cleaning. \n\nHonestly doing it in someone else\u2019s house, having bigger place without paying for a venue (a good one in fact), partially paying for it, not having to clean your house after sounds like a good deal to me lol. She can just pay for a cleaner and go home.", "One thing you got right, future SIL DOESN'T have any friends. That's why she came back to you.\n\nMaybe you just got too involved, too soon in your relationship with her; she seems to have different views and style.\nNTA, but maybe don't get so deeply involved.", "NTA\n\nShe was rude & ungrateful. Not to mention taking advantage of your generosity (adding 30 people more than originally discussed) & acting irrationally. \n\nShe expanded the guest list while flipping out at the suggestion of changing the venue specifically to accommodate those extra people. You would have been within your right to call her out on the size of the guest list, but you didn\u2019t. You offered her MORE to accommodate what she wanted. You never once tried to reign in her wants for this event. You wanted to give her a venue so she wouldn\u2019t have to give up anything she wanted. \n\nMy guess is after flipping out on you she cried to mommy about how mean you are being. Her mom, probably realizing if you didn\u2019t do the party, she would have to, very quickly pointed out what an AH she is being to you and that she needed to make it right or she won\u2019t have a shower. \n\nWhat you got from her is the closest she can get to an apology. There\u2019s a reason this woman has no friends to do this for her. \n\nShe is an AH. You are NTA. But I\u2019d still suggest taking her for who she is and follow thru on the party for her. I don\u2019t normally go with \u201cjust keep the peace\u201d but in this case the shit she\u2019ll stir will be even more aggravating than seeing this party thru. And then moving forward, don\u2019t volunteer to do anything for her. And most def DO NOT BE A BRIDESMAID.", "NTA..... can see why she has no friends", "NTA and I would politely decline to accept her invitation to \"let\" you do it. If she got that huffy when you were trying to do something nice, do you really want to be on the receiving end if something doesn't go to plan??", "I'm puzzled as to how somebody who has no friends or female relatives even HAS a guest list of 40 people. How can this be?\n\nIt was gracious of you to bow out, that was the correct move. I hope you stuck with that decision, I couldn't quite tell from your post.\n\nNTA", "NTA. At all.  I have no idea what she was even thinking.", "This is a no-win situation.  Bail.  NTA.", "It sounds like you were planning a very lavish event with champagne bar etc. for a small group.  Your SIL sprung 4 times as many guests as you'd anticipated and demanded a venue that wouldn't work and would be potentially unhealthy thanks to crowded indoor space.  She then insisted that the event you're hosting and paying for has to be the way she wants it to be.  \n\nNo.  It doesn't.  I think you'd be wise to tell her that it's clear that you and she have very different ideas about how this party should go, and since you agree she should have exactly what she wants, you're not the right person to host.  Then stick to it.\n\nNTA", "NTA Oh, hell no! Do not try to run anything for this woman, it will only be a nightmare for you and her guests. There are people who you can throw a party for, and then there is this gal.", "She realize that she wasn't gonna have the bridal shower that she wanted after she said all that stuff to you so she's tried to change and get her way. I wouldn't accommodate her she made it difficult for you. Why should you continuously extend a generous offer", "NTA.  I'm glad to hear that she apologized and recognized she was out of line.  Your offer was both gracious and practical, and it appears you're going above and beyond for your SIL.  I hope that this doesn't turn into a long-simmering issue and that the stress of everything just caused her to act in a way that she normally wouldn't.", "Are they already married?", "Esh you seem like you wanted to plan a party not plan a bridal shower, planning a bridal shower really meant you plan the party the bride wants. And you seem insufferable in general. You don\u2019t need to use your money to make people like you, by now you should know it never works for long", "NTA.  I think her graciousness of letting you run it is she figured out the costs etc and decided, out of the kindness of her heart, to let you pay for everything and organize it.  How thoughtful of her.\n\nIt'd be completely acceptable if you graciously turn her down and it's best she find someone else to salvage your relationship with her and your brother", "But, but 40 guests bring more presents than 12.", "Asian family..... and she invited husband's side of the family (which is also my family ) and his side is huge our mum has 5 sisters and all their kids are girls so its only women. So it wasn't just her side basically she invited every woman who was invited to the wedding.", "But you're not some rando. You're her now husband's sister. Her family may not have met you yet, but it's not like they weren't going to anyway. At least twice. possibly more over the years. So not exactly surprising that her reasoning wasn't something you'd considered.\n\nBesides, this was going to be a party in your backyard for a couple of hours. Not you letting them stay with you for a week. How \"comfortable\" did they actually need to be?\n\nWith how extravagent you've commented that she likes things to be, I wonder if the uncomfortable one was going to be her, because she didn't like the idea of her family seeing that you had a bigger place than hers. That your place was better suited to hosting the sort of events she wanted to do than hers.\n\nNot because they would or wouldn't care, but just because she was bothered by it and/or imagined they'd pay attention to it. ie That it was an issue in her mind.", "Err... so having 40 people cramped into a much too small place and hence having to have a total different party from what SIL actually wanted (SHE wanted the bigger the better, not OP) makes OP the A H? On what planet exactly?", "Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful response.  You have highlighted so many issues I've never even thought of, it's so insane to me how accurately some people  on here are describing this relationship based on just this one issue.... quite some time as passed since this happened. I only posted it now because I needed to decide weather or not to give her a chance in planning future events since she may have a baby etc. Soon. \n\nI did end up planning it for her to keep the peace and yes the drama continued. I was already a bridesmaid and couldn't back out of that either and it was not fun but we got through it. I certainly won't be doing anything further than this for her. Over time we all started to realize that she is very spoiled and has never been told no.", "I thought you offered to do this because she didn\u2019t have any friends? Who were these 40 freaking women???", "O no! I can see how she didn't want anyone to feel left out and therefore didn't only invite her side but his side as well. But this obviously is way too many people. \ud83d\ude05", "She did not want to have it at your house - and you insisted, so you are an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTry not to push yourself into the center, this is event is for HER.", "You can organise a party for me anytime :p", "Do not offer to throw her a baby shower. Go as a guest. Bring a dish if asked. \n\nWhen baby arrives, be a fun auntie but don\u2019t offer to babysit. She will probably ask (or tell you) you enough. Let her come to you to ask for favors so she can\u2019t call you pushy or trying to take over. \n\nGood luck.", "I'm going to ungraciously guess anyone in her orbit she thinks will shell out some decent gifts.", "OP keeps saying \"people\" and not women so I'm thinking either the invitees asked to bring their families along or SIL was like \"well, it's not my dime paying for THIS party, so I should take the chance to gift grab and invite literally everyone I know just to see who takes the bait!\"\n\nWhatever the cause, it was extremely rude of SIL to not speak with OP about the rising number of guests..."]}
