I was pretty secure in the relationship and we never checked each others phones, but recently I took his laptop because mine wasn't working to attend an interview online and at that point I saw that most of his social media accounts were still logged in, I didn't want to pry but then curiosity got the better of me and I decided to check his instagram and whatsapp. And I discovered that he had been engaging in explicit video calls with a girl, chatting explicitly with another one and also made out with a girl who he told me was his friend. I lost it when I found out that he'd been doing this to me.  my bf and I went to college together and are part of this huge friends circle... so he had a good reputation in the group and no one could suspect that he'd do this... but there were a few people who didn't like him also... so when I called up this friend of mine from the group and told her he'd done this to me she was shocked... but the news also spread like a wildfire... now everybody is isolating him and he's feeling lonely. And he also wants me back, which is never gonna happen.. but the people who didn't like him are spreading shit about him to everyone they know and it's affecting his mental health and i can't help but blame myself for putting him in that position. \nHe sometimes calls me up crying...other times calls me and swears at me and blames me for ruining his life... he is a really good friend and human being and the only mistake he has done is cheating on me... \nI never thought this would affect him so much... they were all his friends first and I thought they'll all stand by him... but everyone ended up isolating him. Also one of the reasons why I told them the reason for our break up was that from where I come from... almost always the girl is blamed for the break up and I didn't want to take the blame for something i didn't do.  But now  I feel like I am in a murkier situation and it's really hurtful to see him in that situation. \nSo AITA for exposing my bf, when the reason could've just stayed between us?", "created_utc": 1679256302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vw073/aita_for_telling_our_mutual_friends_that_my_bf/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your ex is an asshole and letting the other women in your friendship circle know to be wary of him is being a good friend. He brought this on himself. He\u2019s not lonely, he\u2019s playing victim.

He deserves everything he got and you should block him and forget about him.", "NTA. no one wants to be friends with a cheater.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you answering his phone calls?

A good person doesn\u2019t betray people who they love on that level. A good person doesn\u2019t hide it. A good person doesn\u2019t blame someone else when they have to take accountability for their choices, especially the person who they have wronged. \n\nWhy does he have people who don\u2019t like him? I\u2019m curious if he has a pattern of being an asshole. Sure, there are people out there who may just dislike someone but these people were downright excited to spread this news and make him look like an asshole. Sounds like he has also done wrong to other people as well. \n\nThese are natural consequences of people\u2019s actions. People are their actions and people will be judged on that. A lot of people also don\u2019t want to be associated with people who do scummy things, they don\u2019t want that vibe around them. Sucks to suck.

He cheated on you after being together for four years he was messing around with at least three other women. There is no excuse for his behaviour - he disrespected and hurt you and now wants you back as if nothing happened?

It was a series of concious choices that your ex made over and over. Don't blame yourself for his decision to cheat.", "He is not a good person. A good person is respectful of people especially those close to him. You are excusing him from his actions.  That is not your job. Your job should be the take care of you.

Tell them you don't appreciate them blasting your personal business around as a form of petty point scoring against your ex, and that it's hurting you.

Obviously he's an AH for cheating and lying. Your friends are AH for isolating him rather than just telling him it was a stupid thing he did and then moving on.\n\nI really think at this point that you should call off your dogs.

I was married for over 30 years and would have never considered invading my husband's privacy that way.\n\nYou (at a milder level), for freely spreading the information about what you found on his phone and not thinking that it may cause more harm than good. I get that you would have wanted to vent to some close friends, who should then have kept the information to themselves. I also recognize that the information is yours to share with anyone if that's what you wanted to do. But it's important to weigh the consequences against your motives for doing so. Would you have though it was okay to make a highway billboard with your BF's picture, saying \"My BF was chatting inappropriately with other women and also kissed someone!\" I would guess no.\n\nYour BF was clearly wrong in his choices, no doubt about that, but there are levels of decision-making when disclosing this kind of information freely to others. And choosing to tell all because you didn't want other people to think the break-up was your fault is pretty immature.\n\nYour friends are assholes for continuing to spread gossip (even if true).", "NTA for telling your friend but YTA for getting on his personal accounts.
