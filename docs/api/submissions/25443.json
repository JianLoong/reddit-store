{"id": 25443, "submission_id": "160f2bw", "title": "AITA for thinking that the option for having an au pair look after my son after a divorce is valid?", "selftext": "For context, my wife (29, let's call her Anne) and I (28) are separating after an 8 year marriage. We have a 2-year old son.Tldr for separating is that it is a no-fault divorce (no infidenlity or anything like that) but Anne does not love me anymore and has chosen to leave. Again, this is no individual's fault but I am still willing to try and fix things and she is not.\n\nI have been the main breadwinner while Anne has done a small amount of self-employed work. With the separation I would fairly comfortably be in the position to have primary custody of our son with an Au Pair for care during the week while I work.\n\nI do have some small concerns about my Anne's ability to provide a stable household. She would have to rent with her mother (who is not in a good financial position) and doesn't yet have a job, however I do belive she is a good mother and would try her hardest to provide for him.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, my parents gave us a sizeable amount of money to help us purchase our first house (\\~\u00a3100,000). They told me this evening that they would want this back to help me put down the deposit for my next house. This did not sit very well with me as this does greatly diminish the assets that Anne would be entitled to. I would be willing to part with other assets to try and balance the scale somewhat. **Note** I am not asking about the legalities of this, I am just putting forward an If X then Y suggestion. \n\nThis caused Anne to get very upset. Even though I've explained my parents' thought process behind this she believes that they are doing all of this out of spite and anger. She's saying that this makes it very difficult to look after our son but my attempts to say that I can care for him are just met with \"That's not happening\" with no consideration.\n\nFor clarity, I'm not talking about sole custody either way in this. In all likelihood it would probably be the difference between 3 & 4 nights/week depending on who the main carer is. If I do not have primary custody then I would also be paying child maintenance, this would not be the case the other way around.\n\nNote: If anyone's unfamiliar with an Au Pair, in essence, they are normally someone from abroad who wants to learn the language and culture of the host country in exchange for room, board a nominal amount of allowance and childcare for the host's family.\n\nAITA for believing that me having primary custody with an Au Pair is a reasonable suggestion that should be considered?\n\nEdit: We both definitely want to share custody.

I think its very reasonable to have an au pair but to want an au pair AND primary custody (clearly looks like you want this too) is a bit extreme. Its 100% to not be able to look after your son on your own but to say that you are able to and then pay for someone is not entirely truthful. Your parents cannot turn a gift into a loan and allowing this makes you look like the bad guy here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Its ok to want to have your son 4/3 days and pay for extra support (for this amount of time a nanny would also work).\n2. Its not ok to accept your parents behaviour or criticize your ex for not having the same financial stability after she just had your child and raised him for the last two years.", "Ima be honest, going through this thread a lot of people are making assumptions\u2026..", "You said \"my parents **gave us** a sizeable portion of money....\" Point 1 - the money was a gift and they have no right to ask it to be returned. Point 2 - **us** should mean that 50% of that gift is rightfully your wife's - especially after 8 years of marriage, so you should not be trying to reclaim that outside of a prenup, should you? Especially if there has been no infidelity and no abuse. Unless you are trying to impoverish the mother of your child and deprive her of rightful marriage assets and are attempting to use your parents as an excuse.  I believe you have the responsibility to set your parents straight on that - once a gift is given, it cannot be clawed back. The money they gave to the two of you has not been theirs since the check was cashed. (unless the laws of gifting are different in the UK?) So, if X (parents want to claw the gift back) then Y (you tell them no).\n\nI'm not buying the \"she chose to leave because she decided she doesn't love me anymore.\" I get that it happens, but I get the vibe that there is more going on here than you are telling.  This reads as though you want the Au Pair as be a means to advocate for primary custody both to lessen the amount of custody days your wife has and further reduce the amount of money she has available to care for your son and herself, not that you believe your son being with you would be best for him.  All together, on the information and how it's presented, YTA.", "YTA. In trying to revoke a gift that was to you both as a married couple, you created a circumstance where your child's mother would be too destitute to provide a good standard of living for your own child, whom she planned to care for herself. Instead, you decided that in your largess, partly because you want to structure your divorce in a way to make the mother of your child even more destitute than otherwise, you would rather foist childcare on to someone that is not related to the child and does not have any obligation to them as a family to love them.\n\nChildren need their parents and you are actively trying to deprive your child of his mother. In doing so, you're not doing it to spend more time with your son, no. You want to foist him upon someone else, further decreasing the amount of time he would spend with his parents.\n\nSo you want all of the assets that you both contributed to, financially or otherwise, in your marriage, and all of the custody, but you do not want to actually spend time with your son. In contrast, Anne wants an even split of assets and to care for her own son. But you want to deprive your son of his mother and hire an au pair so you don't have to pay child maintenance. Gee, I wonder why your ex didn't go for your marvelous deal, that would make her poor and deprive her of her son. It's great for you, though, so I guess that's all that matters, the best interests of your son be damned.\n\nWell, I hope she has all of your maneuvering and such in writing because no court would ever give you custody now that you've admitted to trying to deprive her of assets and parenting time so you can foist your son on some hired help. Not out of concern for your son, nope, but for your own financial gain. I would put in stronger words what I think of you but that would get me banned.", "NAH but your thinking is going to collide into the interests of your child. The courts will say that the child is entitled to relationships with both parents, and I'm many states if not most, 50/50 custody is the default.\n\nAlso, if your parents gave you both the $100k, then the house is equally owned by you and Anne. You will have to buy her out of her half, and your parents can ask for the return of the gift, they have no legal recourse there to force the return.", ">To make matters more complicated, my parents gave us a sizeable amount of money to help us purchase our first house (~\u00a3100,000). They told me this evening that they would want this back\n\nUmmm NO they GAVE it you, it was a gift\n\n>This caused Anne to get very upset. Even though I've explained my parents' thought process behind this she believes that they are doing all of this out of spite and anger.\n\nShe's correct. They are. \n\nYTA. You're really just trying to avoid paying child maintenance.", "YTA. All of this stems from your parents\u2019 desire to screw over your soon to be ex and you\u2019re enabling it. When they asked for the money back, you should have said no. It\u2019s not like they have any legal recourse against you. They can\u2019t turn a gift into a loan. If Anne is able to take care of your child full time during the week, let her do it. She can just work on the days your son is with you. That makes way more sense than hiring live in child care and a judge would most likely agree.", "This is incredibly complicated and I'm not really wanting to cast a judgement either way but it really seems the best outcome would be to help her get a stable home for your son.", "YTA. So\u2026you want your kid at your house, but you don\u2019t actually want to take care of your kid. Got it.", "To be clear\u2026 dress it up however you want\u2026 you want primary custody to avoid paying child maintenance\u2026 not because you care about what is best for your child.", "Any suggestion might be considered if it\u2019s not constructed to hurt someone.", "LOL I work for a divorce lawyer. I've seen spousal support for what I make a year awarded monthly. You can't just give your parents that money before the divorce is final, either. A judge/mediator is not going to let your wife just rent some hovel with your mom while you rich it up, he's going to equalize your assets. YTA", "NTA you both agreed to split the week, due to income disparity you are suggesting that you take the majority of weekdays as you have the income to comfortably afford childcare/nanny/Aupair rates presumably to allow your soon to be ex-wife to work those weekdays, without incurring childcare fees, which in turn allows her greater disposable income as she isn\u2019t paying childcare fees. She could work FT (in 4 long days) or close to FT with that split. I don\u2019t understand how this makes you the A H? You sound like you are trying to ensure Annie won\u2019t be struggling . \n\nIt sounds like everyone is still reacting emotionally but that\u2019s to be expected", "YTA bc it's not about wanting your kids more or to be a good dad, it's about control and being vindictive.", "YTA. You would rather have a stranger take care of your child than the child's Mother and unless you and your wife and parents signed an agreement about the money it is community property. You say you have no hard feelings but what you have written tells a different story.", "YTA. You should be paying child maintenance so your ex can care for the children rather than hired help.", "NAH\n\nthere are a couple of issues, your parents asking for the money back, custody arrangements, financial situations and stability, and the divorce. lawyer up. express that you want whats best for the child and amicable co-parenting above all else", "NTA.  Your solution seems reasonable. An Au Pair is preferable to daycare and until your wife has a steady income and a stable environment for herself and your son, it could be the better situation for you all.", "YTA and so are your parents.  You are trying to significantly decrease martial assest before the divorce so that your wife would be getting less in the division of assests. You said your parents gave you that money, so unless you have it in writing that it was a loan expected to be paid back all you and your parents are doing is trying to move assets around with the plan for your parents to return the money to you after the divorce.  You have not stated any logical reasons for why your wife couldn't adequately parent with primary custody, and your proposal is for you to outsource parenting to a non family member for the majority of your custody time.  Even the most minimally competent lawyer will see this.  Hell, I'm not a lawyer and I see it.\n\nSounds like you are trying to punish your wife because she wants a divorce.  You and your parents may have a lot of money but you're not very smart.", "yta - why don't you just give you wife whatever you were going to pay the au pair so that his actual parent can raise him?", "YTA. This is so vindictive.", "Get a good lawyer. NTA", "Nta", "NTA - contracting an au pair isn\u2019t a bad idea. Thats not to say that any concerns your ex will have are not valid. Just like hiring babysitter, an au pair comes with similar concerns and risks. \n\nYour ex isn\u2019t wrong for shooting that idea down as these are uncertain times for her and family. Compromises will need to happen. Some you\u2019ll agree with other you wont but thats the nature of it all. Best of luck.", "Nta and the people saying you are just assuming a lot of stuff. You\u2019re parents of course do want the 100k back cos they do want to protect their own assets which are you and your son. So it is understandable where they are coming from even if you don\u2019t agree with it. And even then that\u2019s something they\u2019ve voiced and not something that you have done. \n\nYou\u2019re not wanting to keep your son away from his mother anyways, you\u2019re splitting custody anyways. And if you were to get an au pair then that\u2019s even better for your son than being stuck in a daycare. He\u2019ll get more attention and better care from the comfort of his own home. And if you don\u2019t get an au pair, he\u2019ll have to go to daycare anyways so what is the difference?\n\nYour wife fell out of love and wants a divorce. Shit happens and you\u2019ve agreed. Clearly since she wants the divorce she also needs to understand that her standard of living is gonna change a lot so she needs to be okay with that as well. At the end of the day your concern should be your child and their health and well-being.", "NTA but what efforts have been made to ensure that you're collaborating with Anne on caring for your child, rather than telling her that YOU can care for him? It sounds like she's concerned she might be cut out, due to the discrepancy in income and living situation. Are you actually interested in sharing custody?", "NTA.  This is a valid option you can consider.", "ESH. You\u2019d pay a stranger to parent your child to avoid financially supporting his mother\u2019s ability to care for him. What is best for your son?

Because they\u2019ve definitely tried that. \n\n\nAnd you know YTA for the house. You know it\u2019s petty and won\u2019t even happen because of legality.

Stuff like this just hurts your kid.", "Au Pair is not going to stay for a long time so you would have endless revolving door, they have mandatory meetings with other au pairs, they are not allowed to work full work weeks, they are usually too young and inexperienced to be the main caretaker who makes decisions about how to raise a child. I decided to not be an au pair myself after investing it", "Can I ask what country you\u2019re in? I\u2019m in California in the USA and I looked into getting an au pair 3 weeks ago. It was significantly more expensive than regular child care. There are agency fees and some other costs in addition to the au pair stipend. I was getting quotes for $40,000 annually.", "Bonus kid also HATED 4/3 - not enough time to get settled in either place. We had the swap on Fridays after school or on Sundays in the early evening, though, so he got a full weekend at one house.

Neither of us could do 7/7 currently. We'd both be working through the week and would need to pay for more standard childcare.\nI'd be completely open to changing to 7/7 once he starts school in a couple of years.\n\nR.e. the house, I do not agree with my parents.

The inability to pick up shifts/cover leave 4 out of 7 days also would work against her in lots of entry level type jobs in my experience. I have faced this issue often as we relocate every few years for my partners job. Our current county is good in that min wage is across the board so employers don\u2019t only hire younger staff it\u2019s was one less hurdle to me being able to secure a job.", "Never heard of it costing that much\u2026then again, everything in California is expensive!", "Sure you agree.

Even if there\u2019s an emergency you can\u2019t just sign off. You have to contact the key people you work with to tell them you\u2019re signing off early and delegate any tasks that still need to be completed that day.", "> I know there are extra costs.I use au pairs, I have never paid an agency fee for an aupair or education expenses for them (I don\u2019t know anyone who has either, none of my au pairs were studying just travelling the world)\n\nokay so I'm guessing you're probably in Europe? that's great for you but OP isn't\n\nand after checking, the UK got rid of au pair visas and was mainly relying on Europeans, and post Brexit there's no legal avenue for Europeans to become an au pair in the UK. he cannot hire someone on a tourist visa. he cannot hire someone on a student visa. he cannot get an au pair visa\n\nhe's basically hoping to luck into getting an au pair who has settled status, or someone coming in on a youth mobility visa (which is much more restrictive). not only is an agency his only option but the number of au pairs available in the UK dropped by more than half and many agencies closed\n\noh and because the number of au pairs dropped precipitously, the demand for nannies soared and so did their costs\n\nso this au pair option is not only more expensive than you assumed, it's likely not even feasible\n\n> you suggested dad pay mum to watch kid instead of an au pair which means mum would spend all the days dad has custody watching the kid rather then working. (As dad will only hire an au pair if he has the greater share of weekdays) Presumably for the price he was willing to pay an au pair so below minimum wage, therefore my point was if she worked rather then was paid to watch her kid any of days she would be better off. \n\nokay no\n\nfirst off the cost to the father is not the same as what an au pair makes. the au pair stipend is a pretty small part of the cost. secondly, one of the reasons that it's significantly less than minimum wage is because of the number of hours that an au pair works\n\nbut that is not the number of hours that the mom would need to provide child care for\n\ndad's argument is that if he steals marital assets and gives them to his family to protect for him (also illegal btw), that the mom could only afford to take care of the child for 3 days a week instead of 4 days a week. their original agreement was that she would have Monday through Thursday and he would have Friday through Sunday\n\nso the amount of childcare costs necessary according to dad's logic are:\n* Friday, while he's working\n* one extra day since mom can only afford to watch the kid 3 days a week and not 4\n\nwe're talking about 2 days of childcare, not 4. so even if the number on the table was just the au pair stipend, if you measure that as an hourly wage it's double what the au pair would be making because it's only 2 days of care\n\nand again the amount that he's spending is not just the weekly stipend. if you take into account all of the costs that an au pair would incur him, the amount is more than enough to pay the mom for the 4th day of child care and did she pay for someone to watch the child for him on Friday (whether that's the mom or someone else)\n\nsure, the father is only willing to shell out for an au pair (or in this case a nanny) if he has the kid 4 days a week but my point is that that is him being shitty and selfish. he's willing to spend money to pay someone else to watch his child 4 days a week instead of paying someone to watch his child one day a week and giving his wife a little extra money so that she can keep to the original M-T schedule they agreed on\n\n> Maybe it would be better to work weekends but we don\u2019t know that. My home country min wage depends on age so weekends/nights it\u2019s harder to get a job as an adult as they prefer teenagers etc to save costs. Also generally weekend work is casual & has less ability to advance much in salary over say a weekday government/admin etc type job even a part time one. \n\nokay so now you've not only decided that the mom is going to stop freelancing and get a job but you've also decided what kind of job she is going to get and that she's going to be restricted by the hiring practices in your home country\n\ncan you project any harder? \n\n> He is attempting to find suitable suggestions to move forward in what is a painful process made presumably worse by his wife deciding she doesn\u2019t love him & his parents pressuring him about $$$. \n\nno he isn't. like every defence you make of him is wildly fantastical stuff that you've invented out of your own life and experiences. also he's a fucking adult, he should be able to stand up to his parents\n\n> It sounds like early days give him a little compassion, it\u2019s not terribly unusual to resort to getting overly factual/logical/focused on non-emotive things to try coping.\n\nnone of what he's saying is logical or factual\n\nno, his parents cannot legally force him to return something they gifted. it's ridiculous for a grown adult to even pretend to believe that. gifts are not loans, and are not contingent on anything. there's no contract that he or his wife have to fulfill in order to keep something gifted to them\n\nnot only that but it's fucking illegal to hide marital assets to keep his wife from getting her fair share\n\nhis first instinct wasn't to protect his child and figure out how to make sure his childs mother had financial stability. no it was to consider taking his son away from his mother so that he could pay a stranger to watch his son\n\nhe not only didn't stand up to his parents, he defended his parents to his wife despite supposedly disagreeing with them\n\nhe didn't talk to a lawyer. he didn't even fucking research au pairs", "OP said his wife did some self employed work. She can probably expand on whatever she was doing.", "Where do you get that I agree with them?\n\nI haven't said that this is 100% what's happening and in all likelihood it won't. All I'm saying is that if it does, I think my post is a reasonable solution.\n\nThis is a situation that's happened in the last 12 hours.

This would essentially just cover while I'm working.\n\nMy work is also fairly flexible, in emergencies (that have happened) I can and will drop everything at work without hesitating and pick up lost time elsewhere e.g. once he's gone to bed.\n\nMy preference of an Au Pair over say, daycare, is having him in the home, where I can still supervise with a person who is solely responsible for their wellbeing.", "Perhaps but that again is an assumption (which I acknowledge I made many of myself.
