{"id": 25443, "submission_id": "160f2bw", "title": "AITA for thinking that the option for having an au pair look after my son after a divorce is valid?", "selftext": "For context, my wife (29, let's call her Anne) and I (28) are separating after an 8 year marriage. We have a 2-year old son.Tldr for separating is that it is a no-fault divorce (no infidenlity or anything like that) but Anne does not love me anymore and has chosen to leave. Again, this is no individual's fault but I am still willing to try and fix things and she is not.\n\nI have been the main breadwinner while Anne has done a small amount of self-employed work. With the separation I would fairly comfortably be in the position to have primary custody of our son with an Au Pair for care during the week while I work.\n\nI do have some small concerns about my Anne's ability to provide a stable household. She would have to rent with her mother (who is not in a good financial position) and doesn't yet have a job, however I do belive she is a good mother and would try her hardest to provide for him.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, my parents gave us a sizeable amount of money to help us purchase our first house (\\~\u00a3100,000). They told me this evening that they would want this back to help me put down the deposit for my next house. This did not sit very well with me as this does greatly diminish the assets that Anne would be entitled to. I would be willing to part with other assets to try and balance the scale somewhat. **Note** I am not asking about the legalities of this, I am just putting forward an If X then Y suggestion. \n\nThis caused Anne to get very upset. Even though I've explained my parents' thought process behind this she believes that they are doing all of this out of spite and anger. She's saying that this makes it very difficult to look after our son but my attempts to say that I can care for him are just met with \"That's not happening\" with no consideration.\n\nFor clarity, I'm not talking about sole custody either way in this. In all likelihood it would probably be the difference between 3 & 4 nights/week depending on who the main carer is. If I do not have primary custody then I would also be paying child maintenance, this would not be the case the other way around.\n\nNote: If anyone's unfamiliar with an Au Pair, in essence, they are normally someone from abroad who wants to learn the language and culture of the host country in exchange for room, board a nominal amount of allowance and childcare for the host's family.\n\nAITA for believing that me having primary custody with an Au Pair is a reasonable suggestion that should be considered?\n\nEdit: We both definitely want to share custody.

I think its very reasonable to have an au pair but to want an au pair AND primary custody (clearly looks like you want this too) is a bit extreme. Its 100% to not be able to look after your son on your own but to say that you are able to and then pay for someone is not entirely truthful. Your parents cannot turn a gift into a loan and allowing this makes you look like the bad guy here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Its ok to want to have your son 4/3 days and pay for extra support (for this amount of time a nanny would also work).\n2. Its not ok to accept your parents behaviour or criticize your ex for not having the same financial stability after she just had your child and raised him for the last two years.", "Ima be honest, going through this thread a lot of people are making assumptions\u2026..", "You said \"my parents **gave us** a sizeable portion of money....\" Point 1 - the money was a gift and they have no right to ask it to be returned. Point 2 - **us** should mean that 50% of that gift is rightfully your wife's - especially after 8 years of marriage, so you should not be trying to reclaim that outside of a prenup, should you? Especially if there has been no infidelity and no abuse. Unless you are trying to impoverish the mother of your child and deprive her of rightful marriage assets and are attempting to use your parents as an excuse.  I believe you have the responsibility to set your parents straight on that - once a gift is given, it cannot be clawed back. The money they gave to the two of you has not been theirs since the check was cashed. (unless the laws of gifting are different in the UK?) So, if X (parents want to claw the gift back) then Y (you tell them no).\n\nI'm not buying the \"she chose to leave because she decided she doesn't love me anymore.\" I get that it happens, but I get the vibe that there is more going on here than you are telling.  This reads as though you want the Au Pair as be a means to advocate for primary custody both to lessen the amount of custody days your wife has and further reduce the amount of money she has available to care for your son and herself, not that you believe your son being with you would be best for him.  All together, on the information and how it's presented, YTA.", "YTA. In trying to revoke a gift that was to you both as a married couple, you created a circumstance where your child's mother would be too destitute to provide a good standard of living for your own child, whom she planned to care for herself. Instead, you decided that in your largess, partly because you want to structure your divorce in a way to make the mother of your child even more destitute than otherwise, you would rather foist childcare on to someone that is not related to the child and does not have any obligation to them as a family to love them.\n\nChildren need their parents and you are actively trying to deprive your child of his mother. In doing so, you're not doing it to spend more time with your son, no. You want to foist him upon someone else, further decreasing the amount of time he would spend with his parents.\n\nSo you want all of the assets that you both contributed to, financially or otherwise, in your marriage, and all of the custody, but you do not want to actually spend time with your son. In contrast, Anne wants an even split of assets and to care for her own son. But you want to deprive your son of his mother and hire an au pair so you don't have to pay child maintenance. Gee, I wonder why your ex didn't go for your marvelous deal, that would make her poor and deprive her of her son. It's great for you, though, so I guess that's all that matters, the best interests of your son be damned.\n\nWell, I hope she has all of your maneuvering and such in writing because no court would ever give you custody now that you've admitted to trying to deprive her of assets and parenting time so you can foist your son on some hired help. Not out of concern for your son, nope, but for your own financial gain. I would put in stronger words what I think of you but that would get me banned.", "NAH but your thinking is going to collide into the interests of your child. The courts will say that the child is entitled to relationships with both parents, and I'm many states if not most, 50/50 custody is the default.\n\nAlso, if your parents gave you both the $100k, then the house is equally owned by you and Anne. You will have to buy her out of her half, and your parents can ask for the return of the gift, they have no legal recourse there to force the return.", ">To make matters more complicated, my parents gave us a sizeable amount of money to help us purchase our first house (~\u00a3100,000). They told me this evening that they would want this back\n\nUmmm NO they GAVE it you, it was a gift\n\n>This caused Anne to get very upset. Even though I've explained my parents' thought process behind this she believes that they are doing all of this out of spite and anger.\n\nShe's correct. They are. \n\nYTA. You're really just trying to avoid paying child maintenance.", "YTA. All of this stems from your parents\u2019 desire to screw over your soon to be ex and you\u2019re enabling it. When they asked for the money back, you should have said no. It\u2019s not like they have any legal recourse against you. They can\u2019t turn a gift into a loan. If Anne is able to take care of your child full time during the week, let her do it. She can just work on the days your son is with you. That makes way more sense than hiring live in child care and a judge would most likely agree.", "This is incredibly complicated and I'm not really wanting to cast a judgement either way but it really seems the best outcome would be to help her get a stable home for your son.", "YTA. So\u2026you want your kid at your house, but you don\u2019t actually want to take care of your kid. Got it.", "To be clear\u2026 dress it up however you want\u2026 you want primary custody to avoid paying child maintenance\u2026 not because you care about what is best for your child.", "Any suggestion might be considered if it\u2019s not constructed to hurt someone.", "LOL I work for a divorce lawyer. I've seen spousal support for what I make a year awarded monthly. You can't just give your parents that money before the divorce is final, either. A judge/mediator is not going to let your wife just rent some hovel with your mom while you rich it up, he's going to equalize your assets. YTA", "NTA you both agreed to split the week, due to income disparity you are suggesting that you take the majority of weekdays as you have the income to comfortably afford childcare/nanny/Aupair rates presumably to allow your soon to be ex-wife to work those weekdays, without incurring childcare fees, which in turn allows her greater disposable income as she isn\u2019t paying childcare fees. She could work FT (in 4 long days) or close to FT with that split. I don\u2019t understand how this makes you the A H? You sound like you are trying to ensure Annie won\u2019t be struggling . \n\nIt sounds like everyone is still reacting emotionally but that\u2019s to be expected", "YTA bc it's not about wanting your kids more or to be a good dad, it's about control and being vindictive.", "YTA. You would rather have a stranger take care of your child than the child's Mother and unless you and your wife and parents signed an agreement about the money it is community property. You say you have no hard feelings but what you have written tells a different story.", "YTA. You should be paying child maintenance so your ex can care for the children rather than hired help.", "NAH\n\nthere are a couple of issues, your parents asking for the money back, custody arrangements, financial situations and stability, and the divorce. lawyer up. express that you want whats best for the child and amicable co-parenting above all else", "NTA.  Your solution seems reasonable. An Au Pair is preferable to daycare and until your wife has a steady income and a stable environment for herself and your son, it could be the better situation for you all.", "YTA and so are your parents.  You are trying to significantly decrease martial assest before the divorce so that your wife would be getting less in the division of assests. You said your parents gave you that money, so unless you have it in writing that it was a loan expected to be paid back all you and your parents are doing is trying to move assets around with the plan for your parents to return the money to you after the divorce.  You have not stated any logical reasons for why your wife couldn't adequately parent with primary custody, and your proposal is for you to outsource parenting to a non family member for the majority of your custody time.  Even the most minimally competent lawyer will see this.  Hell, I'm not a lawyer and I see it.\n\nSounds like you are trying to punish your wife because she wants a divorce.  You and your parents may have a lot of money but you're not very smart.", "yta - why don't you just give you wife whatever you were going to pay the au pair so that his actual parent can raise him?", "YTA. This is so vindictive.", "Get a good lawyer. NTA", "Nta", "NTA - contracting an au pair isn\u2019t a bad idea. Thats not to say that any concerns your ex will have are not valid. Just like hiring babysitter, an au pair comes with similar concerns and risks. \n\nYour ex isn\u2019t wrong for shooting that idea down as these are uncertain times for her and family. Compromises will need to happen. Some you\u2019ll agree with other you wont but thats the nature of it all. Best of luck.", "Nta and the people saying you are just assuming a lot of stuff. You\u2019re parents of course do want the 100k back cos they do want to protect their own assets which are you and your son. So it is understandable where they are coming from even if you don\u2019t agree with it. And even then that\u2019s something they\u2019ve voiced and not something that you have done. \n\nYou\u2019re not wanting to keep your son away from his mother anyways, you\u2019re splitting custody anyways. And if you were to get an au pair then that\u2019s even better for your son than being stuck in a daycare. He\u2019ll get more attention and better care from the comfort of his own home. And if you don\u2019t get an au pair, he\u2019ll have to go to daycare anyways so what is the difference?\n\nYour wife fell out of love and wants a divorce. Shit happens and you\u2019ve agreed. Clearly since she wants the divorce she also needs to understand that her standard of living is gonna change a lot so she needs to be okay with that as well. At the end of the day your concern should be your child and their health and well-being.", "NTA but what efforts have been made to ensure that you're collaborating with Anne on caring for your child, rather than telling her that YOU can care for him? It sounds like she's concerned she might be cut out, due to the discrepancy in income and living situation. Are you actually interested in sharing custody?", "NTA.  This is a valid option you can consider.", "ESH. You\u2019d pay a stranger to parent your child to avoid financially supporting his mother\u2019s ability to care for him. What is best for your son?

My home country min wage depends on age so weekends/nights it\u2019s harder to get a job as an adult as they prefer teenagers etc to save costs.
