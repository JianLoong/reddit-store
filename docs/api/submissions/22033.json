If you\u2019d already made plans then you weren\u2019t free.

You have plans. Both excellent reasons to say no.\n\nJust because someone asks you to do something, does not mean you need to do it!\n\nEven if they get upset when you say no it still doesn\u2019t mean you have done anything wrong! It just means that they are upset that their plans don\u2019t mesh with your plans. \n\nYou have every right to stick to your plans.", "Absolutely NTA.  You should be spending your day off relaxing and having fun.  You are not responsible for babysitting these children.  Let the parents find someone else.", "Thank you all for making my point", "NTA\n\nThis doesn\u2019t really need explaining, but I\u2019ll do it anyway. It\u2019s your day off. Why should you sacrifice your day off to watch kids that isn\u2019t yours? I wouldn\u2019t even offer a compromise; my day off is my day off. I wanna spend it like I wanna. You should do the same.", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly ok to say no and it's not as though you are letting them down at the last minute.   You have plans and shouldn't have to change them because of what is a non-emergency.\n\nThey are not your kids and the dad can take some time off work if nobody else is available.  It's part of being a parent.", "NTA. If they are not YOUR kids, then why would you be an ahole for not watching them? No was enough. Just NO. No need to explain why. No need to offer alternative options. Child care is the responsibility of the parent/s or guardians. Not others.", "NTA\n\nNot your kids. You have plans. No, is a complete sentence.", "NTA to want a day off.  It's a good thing for yourself to learn to say no to people.  You don't always have to compromise and find middle ground.  Just say no and go do your plans.", "No, you\u2019re not the asshole. \n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t want to do something then don\u2019t \u2018politely\u2019 or otherwise compromise your needs. \n\nNo really is a full sentence all on its own. You don\u2019t have to justify, apologise, defend or explain, just, \u2018No, I am unable to do that on that day\u2019. \n\nGet used to making boundaries with others so you get your needs met. It\u2019s lovely to be polite but not at the expense of yourself. You come first. Your needs come first. People asking favours have to get in line. Good people will accept without question. Not so good will argue against you or try to make you change your mind. Boundaries don\u2019t just help us to get our needs met, they also help us to work out who we keep in our lives and who we distance ourselves from. \n\nEnjoy your child free day off! \n\nNTA", "NTA and you don't indicate what relationship you have with this person, but you're not obligated to care for any child who is not yours.", "NTA. \n\nBut why do these people have power over you to even ask for this?\n\nHow did they know what day you are free?\n\nAre these your parents whom you live with and thus have to be obeyed or you risk punishment?\n\nBecause if not, then you can certainly tell them no and that's the end of it. You don't discuss with them, whether or not you have the right to say no.\n\nYou just say no, a beautiful word, so useful on many an occasion.\n\nNo: it shimmers in the sunlight of freedom. *Just say no*. And then hang up or walk away, whatever.\n\nAnd after that, be very wary of these people, who will continue to try to exercise power over you.\n\nJUST SAY NO.", "NTA they aren't yours", "NTA\n\nYou already made plans.

You do not need to give a reason.
