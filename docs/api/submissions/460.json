I always watch her children. She had her first when she was a senior, in high school and since I was older I would watch her baby from the time she went to school to the time she got out, starting when he was 3 weeks old. I even had to wear a fake boob. I have went above and beyond for her, always there whenever she needed it, which was a little too often. Her kids would stay with me on the weekends sometimes and she just wouldn\u2019t pick them up Sunday night so I\u2019d have to take them to school. She makes okay money as a xray tech but she blows it all. Now that I have a better job, I would help her buy groceries from time to time and necessities because I felt bad for the kids. She would mooch off me and our parent, she just thinks she can call us and ask for anything and we\u2019ll give it to her. Ive only allowed this so much because my nieces and nephews will go without food, soap, toothpaste, toilet paper, sometimes even electricity. \n \nI came by last night because she told me she had something to show me. I get there and she runs up to me and hands me a positive pregnancy test. I just stared at her and was like are you serious? She was very excited and jumping all around. I told her she couldn\u2019t take care of the ones she had, why did she think this was a good idea. She started to cry and said how she does everything for this family and her kids, so I reminded her of all that I\u2019ve done. I will never throw something I\u2019ve done for you in your face, I\u2019m happy to help but she can\u2019t act like I never helped her.\n \nShe told me I was a b*tch, and only thought about myself and that she would be happy for me if I was pregnant. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be lending her anymore money or support, it wasn\u2019t my job to feed her family. She kicked me out and that night my other sister FaceTimed me and told me I could\u2019ve atleast pretended to be happy for her. My sister has been continuously texting me asking if i really won\u2019t help her out nomore and to think about my nieces and nephews.  I told her no, and she said \u201cI never knew how sick of a person you really are.\u201d I don\u2019t think I should have to fake being happy for her when she can\u2019t even take care of her own kids she already has.", "created_utc": 1667095398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh1ti9/aita_for_not_supporting_my_sisters_pregnancy_and/", "score": 816, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would however be prepared to involve CPS if her kids are going without food and electricity. Your sister needs a hard reality check and those kids deserve a better parent.", "NTA. If she isn't providing necessities for the children, you need to call CPS.", "NTA. Stop giving her money, she will never grow up. Do you want to support her kids until they are 18? Because if you don't put a stop to this RIGHT now that's what is going to happen. No is a complete sentence OP. You can do this", "NTA. If she's grown enough to make this decision, she's grown enough to step up and fully take care of her kids.", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like your sister has become quite comfortable with everyone else supporting her kids, while she makes no effort to budget her earnings and properly care for them herself. Good for you for finally setting boundaries with her.", "NTA - I can relate and I will tell you that I am just as appalled and disgusted by my own sister who decided to have 5 kids despite her inability to care for them. She always dumped them on family members, treated them like shit because she began to resent them, blamed them for all her problems and chose to focus on partying and living her life to the fullest. They're grown now and they barely talk to her.\n\nShe's only thinking of herself. You're being honest and saying what she needs to hear. Children aren't objects to be collected like they're a funko pop.", "NTA and if anyone tries to call you one, kindly tell them your sister needs them to donate time and money to care for her children. \n\nNot your kids, not your financial responsibility. DO NOT give her money, she'll just go out and get pregnant again and give birth to another child who she cannot care for. The true victims in this are her children. \n\n(If her children are going without basic necessities, she's abusing them. There is a huge difference between being poor or down on your luck but doing anything and everything to ensure your children are clean, fed, and warm. But intentionally bringing in another life and mouth to feed while demanding money and help from someone who didn't birth that child or help conceive them? That's negligence.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide info I'm interested in: Where is/are the father(s) of her kids? Do they not give her financial support? Who is the father of her newest pregnancy if you know? Did she go out and get pregnant from a ONS?", "NTA\u2026your sister is ridiculous. Go enjoy your life and don\u2019t let this derail your plans or happiness. You are a sibling, not an indentured servant or an ATM", "NTA\n\nIf you can\u2019t take care of the kids you have, you shouldn\u2019t be having more. Her lack of responsibility does not make it become your financial responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nUgh. I'm sorry but the abuse will not stop so long as you are in contact with her and not doing her bidding.\n\nI'm as dismayed as you are that she's still breeding. \n\nDon't let her get to you. I'm sorry that you can't keep the same close relationship with her children, I really am, but that's on her, not you.", "NTA - The sense of entitlement is strong with that one.  I see Dad is in the picture.  He needs to step up and deal with this situation, not you.  You're probably on the list for sainthood for all you've done for your immature sibling.  It's time for you to live your own life and start investing your money in your own future, not raising her brood.  And anyone in your family who gives you grief can just take over as ATM/nanny/fake boob wearer.", "NTA. A some point you have to stop enabling bad behavior. Just try to keep tabs on the kids so that if the situation gets bad you can call in CPS...again.", "NTA... BUT there is a reason she is having another.... she has enablers in her life. I almost wanted to put an y-t-a for helping her get into this mess. But that falls on your actual parents.\nFrom now on, no more money. If absolutely necessary bring a bag of groceries and toiletries. \nCreate a list of social services she can call and food banks. \nOccupy yourselves so that your availability for child care is limited and pre-planned only.\nYou are NOT these children parent...\n How many will she have if you keep this up.?", "NTA and there is something seriously wrong with your sister if she really wanted to get pregnant.\nIt\u2019s time to start thinking about yourself and stop funding her crazy lifestyle", "NTA -You don\u2019t have to be fake happy. She needed a reality check. You\u2019re literally helping her feed her kids and keep the lights on and she has the nerve to be mad at you and then ask you if you\u2019re not really helping anymore??", "NTA. I had 2 kids when I was 19 and I've asked my parents for financial help twice. They used to take the kids for a weekend sometimes but that was only a couple times a year. My kids are 20 now but my point is your sister is the one who had the kids so it's her responsibility to be there and support them, not yours.", "NTA but your sister seems like she has a mental issue.  Where are these children's father? That's who she should be asking for money. The rest of the family is enabling this ridiculous behavior.  She's going to continue to have kids in order for everyone to help her.  Sad.", "NTA. Good for you for putting your foot down! Keep that boundary strong. You've been her ATM for long enough.", "NTA. She is reckless and can't afford to raise the kids on her own (some likely due to what she does when they aren't around). I would be pissed as well with the news. Great, more work and/or money for everyone else to help out with.", "NTA, at all. Her poor decisions are not your responsibility. Family or not.", "NTA", "NTA but stick to that promise.", "CALL CPS. You\u2019re enabling her behavior.", "NTA. Stop giving money, stop babysitting, and stop helping in any other way. If she only recently tested positive, she still has time to decide if she wants to continue this pregnancy, knowing she'll have four kids to take care of on her own in 9 months.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nShe needed a reality check and you handed her one. The kids have a father too to provide for them.\n\nDon't back down. From what your family said to you it sounds like everyone is fed up of being her ATM and free sitter.", "Good for you. That is some selfish stuff. Sounds like at some point not to long from now the authorities will end up being called for the poor state of her kids. Which really sucks. But NTA.", "NTA Where is/are the father(s) of these children? Why aren\u2019t they supporting them? Your sister must be unhinged to think anyone would be happy that she\u2019s bringing another life she can\u2019t support into the world.", "INFO: what\u2019s a fake boob, and why did you have to wear one?", "NTA. You never had any obligation to support her and seems very irresponsible. Please call CPS if you don't think she can meet her children's basic needs.", "Good for you for finally putting your foot down. Also might be a good idea to call CPS in the future if she seriously can\u2019t take care of her kids. She\u2019s awful and so irresponsible\n\nNta", "NTA block her for a while so she knows you\u2019re serious. You\u2019ve enabled the behaviour for so long it\u2019s no suprise she expects so much of you. The kids have two parents with jobs they do not need you to be providing for them. She needs to get her act together and that\u2019s not going to happen until she realises SHE is responsible for providing for the children she keeps popping out.", "NTA but you will be if you allow her to bully you into caving. She doesn\u2019t care about the necessities of her kids because other people have always bailed her out and taken on the responsibility. Please tell her husband as well, I\u2019d be shocked if he knew the full extent and continued to leave their children in her \u201ccare\u201d. Please don\u2019t allow the threat of your nieces and nephews not being cared for make you second guess yourself, she will provide for them when there\u2019s no one else to drop the responsibility on, and if she\u2019s really that heartless they shouldn\u2019t be in her care at all.", "NTA. Everything you said to her was true. She's struggling with the kids she has right now so adding another mouth will not help. Time for you to set some hard boundaries. Free babysitting except for a true emergency, someone in the hospital for instance, actually only if someone is in the hospital, is out. No more direct cash to her. If you want to help then have food or clothes delivered. No more direct cash to her. I repeated that because that's what she'll want. The family will be upset with you but you have to make it clear you love your sister and her kids but you do not support her decisions to continue to make her life and her kids lives tougher.", "NTA - I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t hit you with the \u201cIt takes a village\u201d line yet.", "NTA\n>\u201cI never knew how sick of a person you really\n\nSaid the person using babies as meal tickets. If you want to do for your niblings give them food or clothes directly. If she can't pay her bills to keep water and lights on call CPS. Honestly it sounds like they should have done BEEN. Often they don't/can't do much with neglectful parents being propped up by shitty enablers keeping their kids limping along with the bare minimum of care but it might scare your sister into spending money on food and electricity rather than dumb shit. If she actually cared about her kids that is, although from your post that's debatable.\n\nEdit: just saw she's had interactions with CPS, which likely didn't result in any changes because of the support received from OP and other family. If losing OPs support is significant that may change.", "NTA. People that can't afford more children should stop having children. As I get older I am really starting to wonder if reproductive autonomy is a human right worth defending.", "NTA. You are not a sick person. She is insane to think you should take care of her children who she can\u2019t provide for.", "NTA\n\n> Her kids would stay with me on the weekends sometimes and she just wouldn\u2019t pick them up Sunday night so I\u2019d have to take them to school. \n\nDoes she even LIKE her kids???\n\nIn the context where you are already heavily supporting her (when you shouldn\u2019t be) I can totally understand why you aren\u2019t happy.\n\nBecause you aren\u2019t stupid.\n\nYou know that her decision will mean more work and financial cost for you because she doesn\u2019t take care of her children.", "Nta, where is the father? Are there different men for the kids? Is the latest going to take any responsibility? Is she getting any child support?  Not your kids, not your responsibility. Tell her she wants to have this child. She needs to figure out how she is going to support it as it's not your problem.

But I\u2019m not sure if he knows about the rest", "Yeah, like she can still call and report stuff. Having a case be closed doesn\u2019t mean she is off the hook for neglect forever. They will open another one.", "In the southern United States. Not sure how much policies vary, but I'd check your county.", "Hi Op, I was part of CPS cases on my parents end growing up in NYS. They absolutely stay on record for some time & they can see her name was linked to a case no matter what. I would absolutely try to call again & mention that CPS has already been involved once & nothing has changed. You\u2019re welcome to DM me if you have questions, but calling them does sound like it needs to happen asap.", "Plus the situation has changed. She's having another baby. Even if she was getting by with 3 kids, she is going to be struggling with the addition of another,", "Ummm.. most truck drivers make really decent wages in the US. If your sister is an X-ray tech her salary is about $45-$70k per year depending on specialty and location. She and her husband are probably not struggling financially as much as she pretends.  They have been living frivolously because of the money you and your family provided while still failing to take care of those kids properly.", "It\u2019s time to tell him", "Well, I'm sure the rest of the family will continue to allow her to blow her money and neglect the kids. Honestly, I wouldn't be a part of it.  If she came to me I'd tell her let me call BIL and I'd make sure he knows everything the children are being neglected.  If the problem persist I believe CPS needs to be called.", "You should sit down and tell the husband to the extent of help his wife receives financially and physically from you and the rest of the family. He may not even know CPS was involved too. If he was incredibly greatful for your help he will most likely be mortified to find out your sisters habits.", "Is this guy the father of all or some of the children? If he is the father of all of the kids, do you think she baby trapped him in high school and he may resent his situation?", "How does he see no electricity in the place and nice nails, hair done and new clothes? She get the electricity turned back on before he comes home from a trip? Is she a SAHM? She is killing his credit if that is the case and is in his name. Husband needs his eyes opened!", "She does make decent money. And her husband leaves money home for them also. He does take some with him. She just blows all of her money on unnecessary expensive things", "Yes he\u2019s the father of all and I\u2019m not sure if she baby trapped him. He was our neighbor growing up as kids, and they started dating in high school. Im not sure maybe things just happen? Im not sure how their personal relationship was in high school because I was already out of the house.", "She\u2019s an X-ray tech", "Stop enabling her, it helps noone and hurts the kids. \nStop bandaiding her spending and negligence with your money and help... again it helps noone and hurts the kids. \n\nIf you don't tell her father and let someone intervene, you are hurting the kids and you would be ta for that. Otherwise nta.", "Yeah, you should cut her off. Maybe then she'll curtail her spending. Or maybe not, if your other family members continue \"helping out\". Either way, it isn't your problem. Anyone who criticises you is free to donate their money.", "So 2 adults with careers and she stinks at budgeting because siblings bail her out. EVERY TIME. Unfortunately you helped create this behavior but good for you on stopping it. You need to tell BIL how bad it is."]}
