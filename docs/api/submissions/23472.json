They can take longer to arrive than they claim, so I like to use this website to order a spare pair when I get new prescriptions.\n\nhttps://www.payneglasses.com/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwlJimBhAsEiwA1hrp5uAhPVDHhpCr69UjGTxorbrnN5PotGUmoxdj15ksDIkrWtHAo-jrbxoCr00QAvD_BwE", "NTA. Tell your fiancee to give BIL the $200 if he wants to help his brother but you and BIL have handled it.", "NTA, but I fully suggest using Zenni and getting glasses for $15-20 instead of hundreds. You don't have to have an active prescription either", "NTA", "NTA, but I think it's probably family differences. My family is super big on never making family pay. And I get how in your situation that would feel odd since they are at fault. Generally in my family it either would have been balanced out by other gifts or a relative would quietly step in and pass money as needed kinda how your fiance is doing. My family are like the kind that offer to pay, but it's kind just a formality and would probably get secretly offended by it or just realize you don't quite fit into the family yet. They are also super generous though. Like when my husband and I moved into our first house, my family gave us a full, nice bedroom suit and quite a few other pricey items. Then when my husband's father asked if we needed a couch and I was like yes, that's the last thing we need actually and then he's like asking me to pay at least twice what the super old and ugly couch was worth and my initial reaction was to be totally offended just because my family works so differently. But in situations like yours my family would function the same and that's kind of the more unfair side of my family. They just don't really exchange money for things. Though definitely my grandparents or someone would probably be slipping the $200 to you at some point or randomly filling up your gas or whatever. They don't like owing people, but they also just don't really exchange money with family. So anyway I know people are talking about the extra step, but I kinda wonder if that's to try and make you fit in with the family so there aren't any hard feelings anywhere. I would maybe suggest having a conversation about it. I know my mind was kind of blown to learn different families can be so different about things.", "Just to clarify - I understand that OP didn\u2019t ask, I wrote that I\u2019d feel weird *taking* the money (even if someone offered it).", "Your partner can give BIL the $200 but do not refund it. You might not get it. NAH", "NTA. Your partner's proposal is odd. If he wants to cover the cost himself, he can now pay BIL the funds directly. I'm wondering if BIL is pressuring your partner behind the scenes and complaining about you, so your partner wants you to return the money as a gesture of goodwill. Unfortunately for BIL, he's not owed that gesture. His kid broke your glasses. You were owed the funds. Their marital situation is irrelevant\u2014it doesn't change what happened to your glasses.", "NAH. Sure, the child broke the glasses, and his parents should pay, but the one who should matter is your fiance, and they offered to pay because they love their brother and want to help.\n\nYour fiance should have told you straight away that he would pay, and he could have spoken with his brother. \n\nIs this the hill to die on? Yes, but only if you want to jeopardise your relationship with your fiance. \n\nBe an adult, speak with your fiance about how it could have been handled better (him speaking up sooner and you advising him in private that you can't afford to pay), and how to handle things moving forward. \n\nIs your face okay? I'd be peeved that the parents didn't take the ball away, and it hit your face. That could have been disastrous.", "WTH, they're not upset paying what they should, why is she? She is wrong, you're not. I hope that boys parents are making him do some  kind of work to pay for the cost of them, age appropriate of course.", "I'm just stuck on why neither parent didn't just take the f'ing ball away from the kid.", "NTA\n\nThey have to be responsible for their lack of parenting or worse things will happen", "NAH. Whenever money and family are involved it's always best to proceed with caution and restraint. I understand why your fiance became frustrated. He loves his brother and understands that even though it was an accident caused by his son-- this is yet another scenario that through no fault of his own he is once again forced to bear the brunt of any negative consequences. It sucks to see a loved one in turmoil and the universe just keeps heaping more on them. And as a fellow glasses-for-life member myself i know that when your glasses break your whole life becomes chaos. To probably best avoid future disagreements with your partner in regards to family/finances situations  you should first discuss it amongst yourselves before responding to the family on the issue. NAH but improving communication with your SO is something to look into.\n\nI forget to add that the only AH is the cheating SIL ....and maybe gravity because without gravity  there wouldn't be a need for new glasses ...when in doubt blame science or alternate facts", "I read it as penatrated and i was fucking shocked until I did a double take", "If you have your prescription from your doctor, you should start looking online to buy glasses it\u2019s a lot cheaper. I see the doctor every two years and then buy them online.", "Could be that, or it could be the BIL was complaining to the fiancee about having to pay. He maybe wants it to come from OP so that BIL will think well of her again and stop complaining. \n\nTo be clear, OP shouldn't do this, I'm just speculating why he could maybe want the money to come from OP.", "NTA. They offered to pay. Don\u2019t words mean what they\u2019re supposed to mean?", "NTA\n\nYour financee is meddling. Everything was satisfactorily resolved until they put their nose in. \n\nAnd they got off lucky. My glasses are $700 oop", "NTA \n\n**They offered to pay the repair and the repair was $200.00 for replacement because they were totaled. They offered you accepted and they didn\u2019t put a dollar amount.**", "The worst part is the timing. But you need your glasses and their kid broke them your fianc\u00e9 needs to switch to decaf.", "Generally I let my spouse deal with his family and I deal with mine. So in this scenario, I might have just run things by my spouse first to get his input, or to see if he wanted to pass the bill on to BIL himself. But I don\u2019t really see a big problem with what anyone did here, it\u2019s just a tough situation.", "NTA. If your fiance is offering to reimburse you for refunding back to BIL, then insist on that payment happening *before* the refund.", "Nbh. Their son broke the glasses, so yes it was their responsibility to provide recompense. It would be nice if you had the luxury of waving off a bill, but you don\u2019t. The fact that your bf is able to and did makes him a gold star sibling. But I don\u2019t think anyone is an AH in this story (I\u2019m giving the kid a pass here).", "Just FYI, fianc\u00e9e is female, fianc\u00e9 is male. You have it consistently wrong in this post.", "YTA\n\nI understand you are young, but did it not cross your mind to talk to your fiancee first? \n\n The question isn't if inlaws would be responsible for the replacement.  The question is, where is your humanity? If you couldn't absorb the loss yourself, why would you not first check with your fiancee?\n\nI don't want to belabor the point, but sometimes you just bite the bullet in the name of being a good person.  If you can't afford $200, I'm sorry, but the only logical person to talk to is your Fiancee.\n\n10 years from now, what do you think BIL is going to remember? He's going to remember his SIL made the worst time of his life harder.\n\nI think you are a good person and probably understand it was handled wrong.  If you want an out, apologize and tell your future BIL that you didn't think of it earlier, but your credit card company has an extended warranty on purchases and you wanted to return his money as it's taken care of.\n\n\nHe may figure out it's a lie, but it's plausible enough that he be grateful for the way to save face.", "NTA. It's a hard situation all around. Kid being a kid. Neither you nor BIL can really afford the consequences. Even though it's \"fair\" that BIL pays for what his kid did, your very generous fiance has given you and BIL an out. I would thank him profusely and take him up on the offer. And he's a keeper.", "sounds like this is the first he\u2019s heard of the situation but yeah seems easy enough to just front it back to him directly", "Suspect it based on nothing. \n\nSeriously.\n\nThis is her fianc\u00e9, not some rando.", "NTA. You and BIL agreed to an outcome. You both followed through.\n\nI think the real problem here is how your fiancee blamed you and told you its your fault. Better look into this and see if both of you have other issues.", "NTA he can give the money to his brother if it means that much to him. If he is worried about hurting his brother\u2019s feelings, maybe he can worry a bit about hurting OP\u2019s feelings for a change.", "NTA. You said that they offered to pay in your post? the OFFERED?!?!?!", "NTA but since its his brother I would think it would be normal to discuss with your so first. I wouldn't ask my BIL for money (or anything) without discussing with my husband first. Communication is always key, had you discussed it he would have paid the $200 and none of this would have happened", "Eww. NTA. You got pelted in the face by a freaking ball by a wild child. Parents are responsible for their young children\u2019s actions, period. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 should\u2019ve immediately offered to pay for any repair/replacement and then accompanied you to your appointment, if he was so worried about his brother having to pay. His brother\u2019s money issues and situation wasn\u2019t new, so your fianc\u00e9 should\u2019ve had the forethought to just offer to pay upfront. Ridiculous.", "This, it can be a cultural difference between families.   My Mom is big on not charging family.  She blew a gasket when my stepfather charged her mother for some work around Grandma\u2019s business.  On the other hand sometimes it can be a burden because she won\u2019t even reimburse those cost of fuel.  My brother has a business, and she is always asking him to do work for her and not wanting to reimburse.", "That's what he did, he footed the bill. He just wished his girlfriend had compassion for his brother like he does because loves him. But obviously you can't expect your partner to take into consideration of non blood related family.", "Take your fiance money and get a new fiance", "NTA - If the kid would have broken a $200 item at a store, the parents (employed or not) would be forced to pay up if they didn't want the police called. Knowing that your fiance is willing to reimburse, return the money AFTER your fiance gives you the money. Or, your fiance could reimburse his brother directly.", "\"SIL is choosing to be petty(which is completely out of character for her)\"\nI'm really confused here, is this for real or sarcasm? How can someone who cheated on their husband be seen as out of character when they are petty. Seems like it would be in her character to me. She has such little respect for her husband she would sleep with another man so I see her being disrespectful and talking bad about him behind his back consistent with her character.", "NTA\nBIL didn\u2019t even ask for a reprieve. He paid up willingly. I think offering to pay him back would make him feel small.", "No he should not. BIL probably isn\u2019t thrilled about his situation and being given the money could be humiliating", "No. Because that means fiancee will actually pay, which I think they are not really planning on doing"]}
