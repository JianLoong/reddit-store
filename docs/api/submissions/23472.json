Same goes for what your kids and dogs break. \n\nThe negligence of the parents not stopping their kid from kicking the ball inside the house only further compounds the fact that it was already their responsibility to pay for the broken glasses.", "In this case the kid was told multiple times to not kick a ball inside but no discipline followed to stop his behaviour.\n\nAccidents do happen but it shouldn't be the OP that has to pay because a kid couldn't stop doing what he was told to stop.

Then he expects you to eat the costs. Yes, like everyone else is saying he fully intends to stiff you. It's very easy for him to refund his brother directly without a huge circus in between. But he is choosing to not do that.\n\nThink about all the options he had and ignored. He has not even considered your own financial situation and the fact that in all of this you are the victim.
