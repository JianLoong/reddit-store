I don't want her living on her own because it's not safe for her. I think at her age it's best if she has some form of companionship. She put me in charge of her affairs just in case something happens, and as such I have medical power of attorney and I manage her finances. She doesn't have health issues at the moment but at her age it's only a matter of time. I have no siblings. \n\nFor her own good, I'm going to put her in a nursing facility this year. She misplaced her keys one day and I'm worried that the next time, it could be something like her Crestor, which she needs to survive. She's also planning a vacation to go visit my aunt in New Orleans, which is totally unnecessary and shows she has bad judgement when it comes to her finances. \n\nMy wife has been crying and begging me not to go through with it ever since she found out. She also called my mom, which is exactly what I told her NOT to do, and now my mom is begging me to reconsider. She's also saying she plans to undo what she did, but I've already talked to an attorney and I think I can make my case to a judge if I have to. \n\nBottom line is this: I've made up my mind and I can't see myself going back on my decision. It was agonizing to come to this conclusion, and I don't want to have to go through it again. I just don't have the emotional bandwidth. \n\nMy mom has been asking what she did to deserve this, that she always tried to be a good mother. I told her she was a great mom, and that's the reason why I'm doing this. It's out of love and concern. Now she's saying hurtful things like she wishes she'd never trusted me and that my dad would be ashamed. I think she's just being emotional and she'll come to appreciate me for this difficult decision down the line. My wife is saying I'm a heartless bastard and is saying she can't even look at me right now. \n\nSo now I'm wondering, AITA for putting my mom in a nursing home when it's the right thing to do?", "created_utc": 1672967880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104gif1/wibta_for_putting_my_elderly_mother_in_a_nursing/", "score": 531, "replies": ["This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)", "YTA.

I\u2019m 30, I misplace my keys. Should my wife put me in a home too lest I forget my medicine one morning? \n\nAnd to top that off, your mother, who you are **oh so convinced** will kick the bucket any minute now wants to visit her sister before said kicking the bucket, and you call that unnecessary?

What you are about to do is absolutely heinous.", "YTA  100%. 70 is not too old to continue to live on her own, as a matter of fact, that is still pretty young.  Misplacing keys is not evidence of needing to be in a retirement home- if it were, my 26 yo would already be in one. You sound like you are doing this more for you convenience than her well being. Crestor is cholesterol medicine, not something that if you miss a dose, you die.  Going to visit her sister is not smart use of HER money??? what do you expect her to do? never see her sister again?  Sit in a chair and rot until she dies? Are you by chance an only child? That would explain your ridiculous conclusion that visiting a sibling is a waste of money.  What I am hearing is that you already see her money as YOUR money and want nothing spent without your approval so that there is as much left as possible for you to get your grubby little hands on. I agree with your wife. I wouldn't be able to look at you either. Face up to the fact that you are really trying to rush your mother into an early grave so that you can get your inheritance and you don't give a damn about her at all. If you did care for her, you would be encouraging her to travel and enjoy herself while she still can.", "YTA. What you are doing is elder abuse. Your mother trusted you to help her with her finances, and you repay her by yanking her out of her home, away from her friends, and isolating her from her family? Because she lost her keys one time?\n\nAs one poster above put it, you are every elderly person\u2019s nightmare. I am glad your mother has spoken to an attorney, and I hope she not only wins her case but disinherits and cuts you off completely. You are a monster.", "YTA. Wanting to visit her sister shows poor judgement? You are an elderly parent\u2019s nightmare. \n\nYour wife is 100% right.", "Yta\nLosing her keys and wishing to see her family isn't not a sign of loss of incompetence. You can't force her in and if you try she can legally fight back. You're also lost likely going to destroy your marriage.

As this is what will happen if your force your Mom into a nursing home against her will. Unless you are prepared to lie, the logic you laid out her won\u2019t fly in court and Judge could find you guilty of Elder Abuse as this sounds you want to liquidate your Mom\u2019s assets and stuff her in a Nursing home so you don\u2019t have to deal with her.", "YTA but also wildly uneducated about how POA works.

She doesn\u2019t have enough debility for a Skilled Nursing facility.

She has diabetes. And she managed her meds. She loses her keys every once in a while. I\u2019m not gonna put her in a home because of that!! What\u2019s wrong with you? And you want her not to spend HER own money?? Let her do so! It\u2019s hers!! YTA. We had to put my grandma in a home when she turned 93 because she had senile dementia. You are abusing your mother. I hope she removes you from her legal affairs and disown you!", "YTA.  She misplaced her keys once and is planning a trip and you're jumping to using medical POA to put her in a home?  She's right, she trusted the wrong person with such an important responsibility.", "YTA she has no health problems, just because she forgot her keys doesn't warrant being thrown into a care home. Let her take the trip. Just because you have power over her finances does not give you the right to take away what life she has left.", "I'm wondering if this is fake as it seems way too cold, cruel and, frankly, abusive to be true.\n\nNot sure which country you're in but in mine your power of attorney can only be invoked if she loses mental capacity. It doesn't give you the right to lock her up just because you decide unilaterally, like a Victorian father, that you disapprove of her choices. \n\nShe's clearly still relatively young and active - many people are fit and healthy into their late 80s these days - and I hope she sees a lawyer to revoke your power over her, because you're clearly abusing it. Massive YTA.", "YTA. Is this even real? A 70yo woman with no health issues who misplaced her keys once needs to be forcibly moved to a nursing home?? And if she dares go see her sister that means she's bad with finances? I'm having a hard time believing this isn't facetious, but if not, it's absolutely awful.", "YTA and fyi, at 70, your mom who has no health issues is perfectly capable of living on her own.  So what!  She misplaced her keys. Doesn\u2019t mean she has dementia.  You are a horrible son and I hope your mother goes to a lawyer and has your power of attorney canceled and disinherits you while she\u2019s at it.", "She lost her keys .... that\u2019s the reason?!? JFC! Everyone on the planet would be in a nursing home.

Clearly, I should start looking in to nursing homes /s SMH", "This is fake... How exactly are you going to put your mother in a nursing facility? If she's able bodied, sound mind and can otherwise take care of herself, I don't see how that's possible. You need a court order to prove she can't live on her own, basically getting custody of your mother. Medical power of attorney will not work, since that's for when she can't speak for herself. \n\nI'm imagining trying to put my 70 y.o. MIL in a home...  The attempt would be futile and hilarious. \n\nYTA for this shitty rage bait.", "YTA. I misplace my keys at least once a week and I\u2019m not even 45 yet. \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. \n\nWhat you are doing is monstrous. Nothing you have mentioned justifies forcing her out of her home after the passing of her life long partner. How could you so thoroughly lack empathy for the mother you claim to care for? If you have any humanity you will abandon this horrific idea and listen to the HUMAN BEINGS protesting this devastating betrayal. You should be ashamed. \n\nYTA. YTA. YTA.", "YTA- I hope this is a joke. 70 yrs old is not old and way to young to go into a nursing home especially if there are no medical needs. It\u2019s very concerning you want to isolate her from her sister and stopping her from enjoying her twilight years by living independently. My grandmother lived alone happily till her 90\u2019s!", "YTA. I don't see why you think that planning a trip to visit her sister shows she has bad judgement when it comes to her finances. It sounds to me that you, actually, don't want to worry about your mom, so the best FOR YOU is to put her in a nursing facility. YOU don't want to think what your mother may be doing, where she may be going or how she is spending her money; you wantto control everything, even your mother's life. She is right: she trusted the wrong person.", "YTA. 70 is not too old to live alone. And as far as visiting your aunt goes, it\u2019s her damned money. You sound greedy and wanting to push her to an early grave with minimal inconvenience to you. So she misplaced her frigging car keys. You never misplace something? Must be wonderful to be so fucking perfect. Hopefully she can get this reversed before you drain her dry. Asshole.", "Wow, YTA. She misplaced her keys? My college roommate did that so many times, it drove me nuts. I occasionally misplace my keys, and I'm basically your age. She wants to go on a vacation, with her money that she spent a lifetime earning? The horror! You don't mention any major health issues, or anything that indicates her mental health is declining. The only bad mental decision she's made is putting you in charge of her life. I hope she can reverse that before you screw her over.", "Holy fuck are you a cold hearted asshole.\nI pray this is a joke.  Otherwise I hope your wife leaves you, takes your mom, and they live happily away from your selfish self centered disgusting self.\n\nEdited to add judgment.  YTA.", "Misplacing her keys does not indicate a need for skilled nursing care. If she doesn't need medical supervision and she doesn't have some form of dementia, then it is not the right place for her.\n\nYou could misplace your keys, too, it's not an indicator of anything.\n\nThis could also be seen as an abuse of power. Medical power of attorney generally applies if a person cannot make decisions for their own care.\n\nYTA!", "You have two choices in this and only one of them leads to destroying your relationship with your mother (and possibly your wife). \n\n70 is not that old, and by your own admission she isn't experiencing any major health issues that would justify this radical solution. Misplacing keys? Making plans to visit her sister? And who are you to decide that her desire to visit her sister is \"unnecessary\"? \n\nI agree with your wife and your mother: you are heartless, cruel, and astonishingly selfish. My own parents are 86 and my siblings and I have been working slowly with them for the past 2 years to assist them with this very decision. It has to be your mother's decision unless she is medically incompetent.\n\n**YWBTA.**", "I think this has to be fake. You can't just put a physically and mentally healthy person in a nursing home against their will even if you have POA.", "I hope your mother gets legal help and realizes she can revoke your power of attorney at any time. When she gave you that privilege it was for handling her affairs, not for taking her from her home against her will. You even said yourself she had no medical problems, who doesn't forget their keys from time to time.", "You really just made the argument that taking a trip to see one's sister is indicative that a person is no longer fit to manage their own finances, simply because such a visit is *unnecessary*?   \n\n\nYTA", "YTA!! Omg just reading this I feel so sorry for your mom.  Going to a nursing facility is expensive and really not necessary based on what you said.  I really hope she can reverse what you want to do because this is outrageous!\n\nYTA", "This has to be fake, right?\n\nShe's 70, healthy, and active. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Your mom misplaced her keys once and you want to dump her in a home. Do you know how many people go downhill after that?\n\nAnd getting all bent out of shape because she wants to go see your aunt? WTF. Its not the right thing to do.", "INFO: Are you planning to book yourself into the same nursing facility twenty years from now if you find yourself so mentally incapacitated that you dare shovel snow in your own driveway", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nForgetting keys is a HUGE jump to a nursing home. That removes her freedom entirely, and unless she's literally medically infirm, is super overkill.\n\nMaybe she should be in a senior community or an assisted living place. Your wife and mother are both right to urge you against such a drastic move. \n\nHonestly, it sounds more like you're doing it for YOUR emotional reasons, not because it's best for her.", "Sorry, so she misplaced her keys one time and booked one trip to see family? And this is an indicator that she is mentally or physically incompetent? I hope I'm missing some part of the picture here, because moving someone into a home can be a very difficult and depressing thing for them, and I can't see why it would be necessary based on given information. Without more detail, I'm leaning YTA", "YTA. I know you say you're acting out of concern but I don't think you realize what you're taking away from her.  You are, essentially, stripping her of any independence she has. And you're doing it very suddenly, not even discussing it with her. It's just \"I've made up my mind.\"\n\nLosing her keys and planning a trip does not equal dementia.  WOW!  You're afraid of what might happen?  Holy shit.  How about wait until there is an ACTUAL problem, then discuss it with her!  Have you even talked to her doctor?  There's a process to go through before ripping someone's life away from them. Unbelievable!  Is she just an inconvenience to you? Is that it?  Just shove her into a home so you don't have to expend any further energy on her?\n\nShe trusted you and you're literally betraying her. YTA, a massive one at that.", "YTA- 70 is really not that old. You don't say anything about diagnosed cognitive decline, so really, you're just being needlessly cruel, taking what remains of her life from her, and she trusted the wrong person to have her best interest in mind.", "Holy shit YTA what the fuck, you\u2019re literally taking autonomy away from your own mother because\u2026 she lost some keys? And is taking a trip to see friends/family?? If she\u2019s healthy enough to get out of the house then she absolutely does not deserve to be put in a home. Your mother is right, you\u2019re a complete failure of a son and she needs to revoke your power of attorney", "YTA, if you really cared about your mom you would listen to what she wants. This really comes down to you valuing your feelings of her being safe over her feelings of having freedom for her life. If you go through with this you will be are horrible son.", "Info: is there any other reason besides misplacing her keys that she needs to be in a nursing home? If not you are being cruel. She's healthy, in sound mind (losing keys is not a real problem), and is able to live fully independently. You think she's bad with money because she wants to visit her family. To me, you're either being wildly paranoid or you simply do not want to deal with your elderly mother. You sound very uncaring and cruel here. I would strongly reconsider doing this to your mother.", "YTA. Is this for real? Of course you\u2019re a humongous AH. 70 is not that old these days. Power of attorney doesn\u2019t give you the ability to force someone capable of making their own decisions do something they don\u2019t want to do. You are being supremely selfish.

You\u2019re concerned about your inheritance. Jokes on you, a nursing home will take it all. \n\nAnd seriously, she misplaced her keys once? And oh my god, she\u2019s going to visit her sister. The horror! Get over yourself.", "YTA. If this is real this is elder abuse. My mom used to work in nursing homes and she made me swear not to put her in one unless she has Alzheimer\u2019s and has no idea what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re horrible places and no one should be in them unless there is absolutely no other option. You might as well kill your mom now, it would be a lot less painful for her. Also, 70 is not that old and it sounds like she\u2019s perfectly capable of living by herself. My dad is 78 and still works (and pulls 16 hour days sometimes). Your insistence that she\u2019s some frail elderly bar is insane. Do you get your hands on her money if you do this or something?", "how do we report this fucker? nothing good -- absolutely nothing good will come from his oversight of her medical care and financial affairs.\n\nthis looks, smells, feels, tastes, walks, talks, and demands like elder abuse.", "So... you can't. \n\nPower of attorney kicks in once she's unable to make her own decisions.
