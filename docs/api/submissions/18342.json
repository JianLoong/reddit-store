Take the kids to the shops with you to dump into her trolley if you want, or call the police to take them, but depending on their age, this could easily be an ESH situation if they're too young to ever be left on their own.

Only one person tried it (luckily it was two of the older kids) - knock at the door, it's the kids, and I see the parent's car already down the block. I told them both that I was sorry but they weren't coming in but I would call the cops to come help. And I did.

Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t seen her clarify either way though at least not yet.\n\nETA: I will concede that OP should clarify if she knew because it is left fairly vague.

The version I heard first was the grandma supposed to watch them, but was in a car ceash on her way there.", "Thank you for pointing that out!", "This. OP, I would state, in text, \"It's terrifying to me that these young kids were left alone in the house. But, BLANK never asked me. BLANK never even told me when she got to the house. I never even SAW BLANK and the girls before I left. I really feel like this is a dangerous thing, and I never want anything like this to happen again. I'd like to ask that BLANK always asks me before leaving the girls with me, makes sure I'm home, and communicates with me before she leaves. I don't think this is too much to ask to make sure the kids are safe.\"\n\nFrame it like you're concerned too, and lay out everything, so if she tries to pull this again, there's a written plan in place. That way, hopefully, this doesn't happen again, but if it does, no one can try to blame you.", "Oh, I hear you, loud and clear!\n\nMIL has been used and abused for decades. Tried to make me her replacement about a month after we were married. Nope!\n\nFIL died and suddenly, all the AH kids she raised have left the scene. \n\nI told my husband I've served my time 4x and I don't want to do it anymore. If I'm in the house to help MIL, AH's are gonna try to use me. \n\nHusband wants my \"help\" with MIL. She comes with a sister who's been playing invalid for years. \n\nNo! No! No!

Assuming the kids are little, it's criminal. She wasn't just hauling ass to get back for the kids' safety. If somebody had found the little ones alone and called the cops, she would have been arrested on the spot.\n\nI commented on a post a month or so ago about how the laws around leaving your kids at home vary wildly from state to state, but the basic rule on the ground is that if the cop believes that it was unsafe to leave the kids alone, you broke the law. Lots of factors go into that and in the end it's a judgement call, but I'd say SIL might benefit from some parenting classes.\n\nNot only is OP NTA, SIL should be grateful that OP didn't report her to CPS.\n\nEdit: u/Sure-Ear1280 I don't mean to sound self-important but please read my comment. The next time SIL, your brother, or anybody else gives you grief, remind them that people like you who are and were aware of the potential legal consequences are obviously on her side.\n\nA link with to the comment I made that gives much more info on when it's okay to leave kids alone:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11udwvn/aita\\_for\\_still\\_getting\\_a\\_babysitter\\_for\\_my\\_16/jcnqyxp/?context=3", "Of the SIL has a key and OP was already in the garage, very easy not to see!", "While doing a donut in the yard in her haste to get away.", "I grew up in the country and same.

Even if it was something you do every day, you still should say hello to the person watching your kids, or yell from the front door, \u201cHey!
