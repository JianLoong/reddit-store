Just like they aren't going to get she was somehow getting groceries while the kid's mom was parking. Nor will they question how she could see the mom unlock the door (vs the kids being handed the key).\n\nThere's definitely holes, and it does change the picture when details emerge. Also, it's curious OP hasn't responded to questions about the kids' ages.\n\nBut... it's also plausible she simply went to the store, saw the kids' mom leave the parking lot, and the next thing she knows her phone is blowing up, the rest could just be OP's best guess at filing in the gaps.", ">What are the ages anyway?\n\nConsidering how SIL tore off back to OPs when she realised that OP wasn't home, probably not old enough to be legally left home alone. Parents rarely tear off home in a panic if their 14-16yo kids were home alone.", "Oh for sure, I can definitely see that perspective too. I felt it was a little strange that she was hitting more on the \u201cnot asked\u201d rather than the \u201cdid not know\u201d aspect as well. But I also originally took that as her meaning \u201cI wasn\u2019t asked so how could I know.\u201d Regardless whatever happened was a big miscommunication/no communication and most certainly weighs heavier on SIL for not checking if an adult was home and just leaving her children but I 100% agree no question that if OP did know the kids were left at the house and still left instead of confronting her SIL or doing anything other than leaving them alone then she is an AH too. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t seen her clarify either way though at least not yet.\n\nETA: I will concede that OP should clarify if she knew because it is left fairly vague. I just took the \u201cwe didn\u2019t see each other\u201d as meaning she didn\u2019t know.", "Then she fully knew her oung nieces were unsupervised at home, and the normal judgement would be ESH.", "But then the stories won't be about \"leaving young nieces alone at the house\", because she can't have left them here if she didn't knew they were there in th first place.", "I was hoping for the sake of the kids that they weren't too young. I remember when a woman left her baby sitting in a high chair with the door unlocked because she was worried about missing a flight. The sitter was due in 5 min. When the sitter arrived, no one answered the door when she rang so she assumed that they had made other arrangements and left. The mother returned and found a dead baby.", "It very well still could be. The actual topic of the post is her being blamed for \"leaving\" the kids, but she doesn't feel like she did. \n\nAnd not being mean here, I think the word you are looking for is \"know\". She didn't \"know\" they there there in the first place. Knew is past tense, know is present. It's a tricky one, but once you get it your writing will improve (and the Reddit trolls won't blast you for questioning language while making grammar mistakes).", "I'm pretty sure that's what she was accused of when her family started calling, not what OP actually believes she did. That's really common in AITA posts.", "New nightmare unlocked."]}
