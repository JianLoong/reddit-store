Seems intentional that you left that bit out?\n\nAssuming you knew they were there when you left (which is confusing because the first half implies you weren't even aware they were there, but the second half you're are defending leaving them as if you did so knowingly), then I'm going to say the exact same thing every other Reddit post like this always ultimately settles on- it was stupidly irresponsible and entitled for their mother to do this, *but* young kids don't deserve to be in danger because of something like this. Take the kids to the shops with you to dump into her trolley if you want, or call the police to take them, but depending on their age, this could easily be an ESH situation if they're too young to ever be left on their own. And I don't care if I get downvoted for this, the lack of information isn't reassuring me that this wasn't a dangerous situation.", "NTA - I was staying with a grandparent after their surgery because they were supposed to be off their feet, no lifting heavy things, etc. I was there mostly to make sure they kept to those 'rules' and to help. And my darned other family members kept dropping their kids off (ages 2 years to 13 years) and heading out to 'have time to themselves', 'shop', 'run errands', etc. \n\nWhiny voice: But gparent *always* watches the kids.\nGparent's weak voice: It's fine, I love the gkids.\nMe: No. I'm not letting the sick person have to deal with these kids especially since it involved lifting and carrying the baby/toddler, etc. I'm not here for childcare, by gparent care. You cannot.\n\nThey continued to do so. I told them, you leave these kids here without getting permission FROM ME again, I'll call the cops on you for abandoning those kids.\n\nThe joys of having a reputation in the family? Only one person tried it (luckily it was two of the older kids) - knock at the door, it's the kids, and I see the parent's car already down the block. I told them both that I was sorry but they weren't coming in but I would call the cops to come help. And I did. Gparent was asleep, still recovering, so never knew until they woke up and I told them. \n\nI stayed by the door, with my eyes on those kids, but nope, not in the house (it was summer, there was shade, they weren't in any danger). The cops came, I stated their parent abandoned them at our house when we said we weren't going to be there (I was actually late for work because I stayed until the cops came). This being that particular time and place, the cops took the kids to where their parent was ... at a bar drinking.\n\nI got screeched at and I said, I'll do it again. Pay for a babysitter, but the sick person isn't your free childcare. The rest of the family was like \"you knew she'd do it. It's her.\" Emphatic nod. You do not eff around with my gparent!", "NTA but...depending on the ages and the state you live in you may have actually committed a crime by leaving them alone.  It would prob be seen as the mother's fault but not sure that would shield you entirely. You might want to find out what the exact laws are regarding unasked for responsibility for minors.", "Clearly an accident on your part but your SIL is the AH for not talking to an adult when dumping her kids on you.", "No. She has a key to the house.", "Depends on the structure of the house and lot.\n\nMy parents and their neighbors all come and go from their garages, which exit at the rear of their houses along an alley street.  Everyone else coming to their house parks in the spaces along the street out front and comes and goes through the front door.  There is no way to tell someone is coming in the front when you\u2019re in the garage or leaving down the alley.", "If she went into the house, didn\u2019t she check if the house was empty or not before leaving the kids inside?
