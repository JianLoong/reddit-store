Seems intentional that you left that bit out?\n\nAssuming you knew they were there when you left (which is confusing because the first half implies you weren't even aware they were there, but the second half you're are defending leaving them as if you did so knowingly), then I'm going to say the exact same thing every other Reddit post like this always ultimately settles on- it was stupidly irresponsible and entitled for their mother to do this, *but* young kids don't deserve to be in danger because of something like this. Take the kids to the shops with you to dump into her trolley if you want, or call the police to take them, but depending on their age, this could easily be an ESH situation if they're too young to ever be left on their own. And I don't care if I get downvoted for this, the lack of information isn't reassuring me that this wasn't a dangerous situation.", "NTA - I was staying with a grandparent after their surgery because they were supposed to be off their feet, no lifting heavy things, etc. I was there mostly to make sure they kept to those 'rules' and to help. And my darned other family members kept dropping their kids off (ages 2 years to 13 years) and heading out to 'have time to themselves', 'shop', 'run errands', etc. \n\nWhiny voice: But gparent *always* watches the kids.\nGparent's weak voice: It's fine, I love the gkids.\nMe: No. I'm not letting the sick person have to deal with these kids especially since it involved lifting and carrying the baby/toddler, etc. I'm not here for childcare, by gparent care. You cannot.\n\nThey continued to do so. I told them, you leave these kids here without getting permission FROM ME again, I'll call the cops on you for abandoning those kids.\n\nThe joys of having a reputation in the family? Only one person tried it (luckily it was two of the older kids) - knock at the door, it's the kids, and I see the parent's car already down the block. I told them both that I was sorry but they weren't coming in but I would call the cops to come help. And I did. Gparent was asleep, still recovering, so never knew until they woke up and I told them. \n\nI stayed by the door, with my eyes on those kids, but nope, not in the house (it was summer, there was shade, they weren't in any danger). The cops came, I stated their parent abandoned them at our house when we said we weren't going to be there (I was actually late for work because I stayed until the cops came). This being that particular time and place, the cops took the kids to where their parent was ... at a bar drinking.\n\nI got screeched at and I said, I'll do it again. Pay for a babysitter, but the sick person isn't your free childcare. The rest of the family was like \"you knew she'd do it. It's her.\" Emphatic nod. You do not eff around with my gparent!", "NTA but...depending on the ages and the state you live in you may have actually committed a crime by leaving them alone.  It would prob be seen as the mother's fault but not sure that would shield you entirely.

There is no way to tell someone is coming in the front when you\u2019re in the garage or leaving down the alley.", "If she went into the house, didn\u2019t she check if the house was empty or not before leaving the kids inside? Still pretty irresponsible.", "How old are the kids?", "Info you left without knowing the kids where there, then under no circumstance are you the a******\n\nBut if You knew she left them there depends on their ages.  If someone dumps a toddler on you. You don't knowingly leave the toddler alone.

You may have been out (like, not just leaving but properly out).

Massive screw up on her part.", "NTA", "NTA obviously, how can you be expected to babysit kids you literally had no idea where in the house? It's so absurd, your SIL already knows she fucked up and is deflecting the blame like a little kid who knows they are in trouble. That was incredibly reckless parenting.

What kind of parent just drops off kids that are too young to look after themselves, but doesnt make sure they've been taken by the person they're leaving them with? Eapecially when you didnt agree to it or know it was going to happen.\n\nThe mother has fucked up and gone on the offensive to make herself feel better. Glad your Bro's got your back!", "Clearly NTA, but equally how can you possibly tell us the situation without including the ages of the kids, big difference between young children and teenagers in term of being left home alone", "NTA\n\nSIL is obviously used to your parents taking care of her responsibilities for her.", "NTA, the kids were HER responsibility. Did she even give you an excuse as to why she dropped them off without even seeing you? How do you leave your kids alone in a house when the person living there isn't expecting them? Hopefully, this was a good lesson for her, at least it wasntlong and it sounds like the kids were fine, this time.", "This. Like even if SIL saw OP\u2019s car there she couldn\u2019t assume that meant OP was home, what if a friend had come and picked OP up to go out somewhere? SIL could have abandoned the kids with absolutely nobody there to care for them and she wouldn\u2019t have known till she was done taking her sweet ass time shipping and got back to (hopefully) two kids still alive and in good condition", "They didn't even know they were there. Given that SIL didn't even check to see if anyone was in the house, he's irresponsible for just dropping the kids off at an empty house.", "My guess is you had to have seen the situation before you left and knew what was happening, but didn\u2019t use your words.", "Mom didn't even make contact with an adult!! Such poor parenting.", "I like your style lady", "Same here", "Also who doesn\u2019t set eyes on another adult/responsible party before leaving their kids somewhere?", "Or she could be a bad mother", "This is assuming both the garage and the front door face the same way, which is not always the case. \n\nIn my current neighborhood, most houses do face the same way but there are a few exceptions. Some of the corner houses that have a detached garage will have the house face one street, and the garage face a cross road . Or if the lot is big enough, the garage faces the next street over with the backyard spanning in between. \n\nI haven't seen any comments confirming if OP knew the girls were there and left anyway, or if they just had no idea.", "I was really confused over this. Like, did she stay in the car at the top of the driveway and told the kids to go find OP on their own?", "NTA but for all she (your sil) knows you could have just triggered bug bombs and left. To drop kids off and leave without a word is super creepy. Does she not think you have a life? Maye you went out for coffee or out of town? You could have left all the scissors and super glue out for the kids while you took a break from crafting and went grocery shopping. Maybe the kids try cooking like my siblings and unleash a torrent of food all over the kitchen. So many scenarios.", "Well this needs to stop.", "Our house faces the street and our garage faces the alleyway. I don't even see the front of my house when I leave. Most of the houses are set up the same way on my street.", "Yes. This info is needed."]}
