Hell you didn't even know she was coming over either to drop em off. Your SIL sucks she is the AH here.", "So your SiL just abandoned her kids? Are we sure they're actually safe living with her? Their dad can't be there all the time after all.", "INFO : How old are they ? When did you learn they were at the house ?", "NTA \n\nI'm glad your brother sees what really happened. Why someone would push their kids into a house and leave without even finding out if anyone was home is stupid.", "If you didn't know the kids were in the house, that would mean the mother just dumped her kids without even knowing that an adult was home to watch them.  This would make her guilty of child endangerment, and a lot worse than just an A.  Your brother needs to take steps to make sure his kids are safe.  You are completely NTA.\n\nThis mother needs to hear from you, from your parents, and from her husband, that she must never, ever bring her children over without first asking and getting your permission to do so, and then making sure that an adult is there to care for the children when she does drop them off.", "NTA", "There is only one TA here. And that's your SIL. Dropping off kids without even checking if someone is at home.  So your NTA.", "Honestly you could report SIL for child abandonment if she does something like this again. NTA.", "Info: did you honestly not know the children were being dropped off, or did you know and you didn\u2019t care?", "Info: Did you go to the shop leaving the front door unlocked? How did she get in?\n\nHow does someone leave children in someone else's house when they're out?", "Has anyone yet asked how old these kids are?", "Exactly. I read this as she saw OPs car in the drive, didn't want to ask to potentially be told no, so shoved the kids in the door and didnt say anything to essentially force OP to watch them. Manipulative AF. Who the hell drops kids off and doesnt directly speak to the carer, if not only to say thank you/to make sure theyre aware the kids have arrived.\n\nIt was manipulative AF.", "Because you were unaware that they were there, you didn't leave them alone. Most sure, the AH is your SIL. Why did she not even ask you to watch them in the first place? How dare she simply expect you to watch them because your parents do! In whatever manner, you are NTA.", "Life gets a lot easier once you've cultivated this reputation.", "I finally found my role model", "I agree. OP left off the ages of the kids, and did not explain how she knew SIL dropped kids off in front. And coincidentally went to the exact same store. Did OP actually leave the house and the kids on purpose to prove a point? Too much info is left out, makes me think OP is being a bit too selective in the information being shared.", "She knew.\n\nESH", "But if she didn\u2019t know they were there do their ages make difference?", "I think they\u2019re just asking because their parents and SIL seem to think they are the AH.", "She was exiting from one door while they were entering from another . Not that hard to understand . If the house is a bit large , it's quite easy for this to happen ... Their age is irrelevant , since OP didn't even know they were there at all . If anything , the entire danger of the situation is on the mother . Who the hell leaves their young kids in a house without checking that someone is actually there? What if OP was out with friends or something ?", "There are zero states where what OP did, according to the post, is illegal.", "How could she be held liable for not watching children she didn\u2019t even know were in the house?  The mother is entirely an idiot for dropping children at a front door without knowing if anyone is even home.", "OP said in a comment that SIL has her own key.", "Not even not being there. What if she was there, but not in a state to watch kids? Sleeping. Sex. Drunk. Sick. There was absolutely no notification and no attempt to even verify the state of OP, let alone that she was in the house.", "OP mentioned going to the garage to go to their car.  Unless SIL went into the garage I doubt she would have seen OP's car if the kids were getting dropped off via front door.", "Your sister-in-law is entirely to blame. She is fortunate that no one called the police and that no harm came to the children.", "Exactly what I was thinking. SIL drops the kids off at the frontdoor without a notice, OP exits the house through the backdoor. I read it as OP didn't see them. The parents were out. Who is to say OP wasn't out of the house as well? SIL has a dangerous habit, one she needs to stop ASAP.\n\nNTA. (If OP *did* see the kids and hust left them, small ESH because it's dangerous, but still SIL would be the major AH times 10 to do this.)", "Because to ask is to risk being told no.", "She literally said they didn\u2019t see each other. What kind of parent leaves their kids without confirming that someone is there to watch them?", "This is the thing throwing me off, I have never dropped either of my kids off *anywhere* without making sure they made contact with an adult.", "So she just dropped her kids in the house and didn\u2019t bother to check anyone was there?", "Did you know she had dropped the kids off before you left?", "Dude read the comments. The mother has a key, unlocked the door and put the kids inside without OP knowing.", ">I was going out the back door to the garage while my sister-in-law was dropping her kids off at the front door.  **We didn't see each other.**\n\nEmphasis mine.", "Yep. When I get a migraine I can\u2019t watch anything functionally. I could easily be home but not able to be the responsible adult.", "Well then surely you would absolutely go in in that case to ensure that OP was home. Seems fishy to me", "NTA. That is solely your sister-in-law's fault. She is fortunate that no one called the police and that no one was injured.", "I'm just trying to figure out how they didn't see each other.", "Because she is the SIL..", "SIL probably never got out of the car when she dropped her kids off. Did she even slow down on her roll past their house? OP\u2019s brother has a wife problem.", "My first thought is that SIL knew she was in the wrong from the start and let the girls out and drove away, probably thinking to call while at the store to let OP know that the girls were on the front step. THEN she changed the story on everyone\u2026making it OPs fault.", "She probably opened the front door, walked them in, dropped off their stuff, called out 'Kids are here', then took off immediately without listening for a callback. This is all on mom.", "I didn\u2019t even leave our kid with my SO when he was younger without positive confirmation of the exchange, and my SO was the same. Gotta know who is on deck.", "The post says they didn\u2019t see each other until they were both at the grocery store.", "Comments didn't answer my questions. How old were the kids, and did OP actually know the kids were there? The \"kids inside without OP knowing\" part isn't clear to me.", "Doesn't mean she didn't knew...", "I get migraines that literally make me blind (full vision spectrum of kaleidoscope colors that I can't see through), so even if I wanted to, I literally could not watch anyone's children. This is so careless of the mom.", "Depends on the lay-out of the house. In our house it would be hard not to see each other seeing as the frontdoor is right next to the living room. But my siblings' house is devided in two (an old part and a new part) with both having an intrance. If they are in one part and we enter through the other one, we wouldn't see each other.", "Well, if she had waited, SIL would\u2019ve had to ask OP for permission to leave the kids.", "Brother is 32yo, so even if they started a family really early (teenage pregnancy not included), the kids would be preteens at the most. So big chance they were too young to be left alone like that."]}
