At the time I spoke with teachers and counsellors and my parents did as well but they did nothing to stop it. \n\nOne of the guys who I'll call \"Tim\" was the worst. He would follow me around, calling me names and making sexual remarks like asking if I was the \"boy or the girl\" and stuff like that. Again, nobody said anything to him or any of the other guys. Which honestly I'm not even surprised now since that was a small town in a very conservative state. I was called into the principal's office once and he told me that I should stop complaining about my classmates because obviously they wouldn't hurt me or try to touch me inappropriately because they are straight. \n\nAfter graduation I went to a college that's out of state as I wanted to get as far as possible from my hometown. Unluckily for me, when the school year started some day I ran into Tim, he had chosen the same university.\n\nHe tried to become my friend for some time until I told him I didn't wanted him to be my friend and quite honestly didn't even wanted him to talk to me. We live in the same dorm and sometimes we run into each other, but I asked him to ignore me. A few months after he messaged me on Instagram and asked me to met up with him because he wanted to talk to me, I assumed he wanted to apologize for the bullying maybe but as I said, I didn't care for his apologies so I told him everything was ok between us but I really didn't wanted to talk to him. Ever since I started running into him more than before, I thought I was paranoid because this guy scares me a lot, but basically he confirmed it once. He told me he recently had realized that his sexuality wasn't what he always thought and he also realized that he was always \"playing\" with me because he actually liked me. I wanted to say something else to him, but as we were in a small place and alone I told him that was rough but I wasn't interested and he should look somewhere else. \n\nThat happened like nine or ten months ago, and ever since he has been making my life hell again. He follows me around and I'm scared, I tried reporting him but since he lives in the same dorm as me I don't have enough proof to make them think that he's following me. I'm scared he might hurt me. And as nobody's believing me I exposed him on Instagram with some messages that he had sent me and some photos I took of him following me. Some of my old classmates follow me and the news about Tim being gay had spread on our hometown. I haven't seen him around lately.\n\nA few days ago he messaged me and told me I ruined his life because now his family disowned him, along some other stuff.

You protected yourself when no one else could/would. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that it included outing him but, again, *he was harassing you.* What did he expect would happen? That you would just sit back and do nothing while he followed you and made you afraid for the entirety of your college life? Nope. He sounds like an awful person and you did what you could to protect yourself from him\n\nI would keep everything and go to the police though, schools can\u2019t do as much as the cops and he seems like the type to escalate because of this", "NTA.  He was continuing to bully you, to try to have control over you, by expecting you to keep his secret.  You owed him NOTHING.  He brought this onto himself.  I congratulate you for not making decisions that revolve around your bully's best interests.", "It's a tough one, on the one hand, you never out someone, but on the other, bullies deserve whatever they get.\n\nWith the constant harassment, I have to say NTA. But, just be careful going forward, thugs who get outed by their victims can get violent towards them", "NTA and actually it is super relevant that his sexual orientation be known when he is stalking and harassing you. This isn\u2019t just harassment it\u2019s sexual harassment and increases the risk to you. Something the staff and your friends should be aware of so they don\u2019t brush it off as \u201cchance encounters because you live in the same dorm\u201d", "NTA.\n\nIf he hadn't bullied you in high school none of what happened afterwards would have occurred.\n\nIf he had left you alone in college after you told him you weren't interested in his apologies or in being his friend none of this would have happened.\n\nIf he hadn't started stalking you when you declined his advances none of this would have happened.\n\nYou posted on Instagram in an effort to protect yourself and to stop the stalking. \n\nAgain, all this is on him & you would not have had to do this  he hadn't bullied you initially, if he hadn't stalked you in college, & if he had left you alone after repeatedly being asked, none of this would have happened.\n\nKarma, you have to love it.  How ironic that the bully to a queer man, has now become a queer man who has been disowned & bullied by his own family.", "NTA. I don't like the idea of outing other people, but he bullied you for years and then started stalking you. It is unfortunate he has been disowned and hurt the same way he did to you, but he never really changed his ways, or made better choices until he was in the same shoes he put you in.\n\nNobody was taking you seriously, so you had to find a way to make him stop.", "Whoah. I never would have thought I'd see a situation where *outing* someone, especially in a highly \"conservative\" (homophobic) area, would be... completely justified. Very few people would ever deserve being outed, especially under these circumstances... but Tim managed it.\n\nYeah, you completely ruined his life. He's spent years ruining yours (to a lesser degree) first. He deserved it, and even if he didn't, you *tried* to use lesser methods to protect yourself and only escalated to this after they failed. NTA", "NTA\n\nObviously, he\u2019s an absolute AH and being gay doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior, but I\u2019m not sure you made a smart choice by outting him.

I would\u2019ve reported his harassment to the police and asked to be put in another dorm.", "NTA \n\nI would normally not condone outing someone, but he took bullying and raised it to stalking. \n\nHe\u2019s being a creep, making you feel unsafe despite moving a long way away to be out of that type of environment. \n\nA taste of his own medicine is definitely prescribed at this point.", "This is tough, because usually outing someone that isn't ready to come out is an asshole move indeed. However, you didn't do it for revenge or anything, you were just scared because he's been following you around. From what you described, you were just trying to defend yourself, so I'm going with NTA.", "Maybe this will be an unpopular opinion, but NTA. He bullied you and then stalked you so quite honestly it sounds like he got his just desserts", "NTA- he was awful to you because he liked you? Then the \"flirting\" should have stopped when you flat out refused him. He's just a bully and that's all he is. \n\n He has more self reflection to do other than realizing he's gay. It's tough he got called out before coming out but he's only getting his karma which always comes back 10x.", "NTA. \nHe was bullying you and you tried to make it stop in high school. It is understandable that you do not want to talk to him and you just wanted for him to stop harassing you. \nIt is sad that he does not have anyone to talk to about his sexuality, but at the same time, it is not your duty to talk to him.", "NTA. It sounds like he fucked around and found out.", "NTA - You didnt out someone for the sake of outing them. This guy has ALWAYS been a problem.  If HE wasnt a problem TOWARDS YOU, you would never have had any contact with them, therefore he would not have been accidently outed.", "NTA\n\nHe played with fire and got burned.", "NTA, he has been harassing you for years at this point and wasn't going to stop no matter what you said. It's sad that his life is negatively impacted by the outing, but he was actively harming your mental well-being, and whose to say he wouldn't of expanded to physical if the situation presented itself? He has no one to blame but himself in the opinion of another rainbow warrior.", "NTA. \n\nLook who just discovered \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d. \n\nHe fucked around for YEARS, thinking you would never stand up for yourself. GOOD FOR YOU! \n\nI usually don\u2019t condone outing someone before they are ready, but this is the one instance where it\u2019s acceptable.\n\nAlso, block him!", "NTA. If he didn't want you to retaliate, maybe he should have accepted your clear rejection. I'd suggest meeting up with him anyway for coffee or something. People change, so maybe he'll surprise you. And also, when unstable people are alone and desperate, they can make poor decisions. If he has some support, he may not lash out.", "ESH. \n\nHis blatant harassment and bullying is not ok under any circumstance. \n\nComing from a fellow gay man, we both know outing others is one of the cruelest acts you can do to gay man, especially when done in a malicious manner. We expect this from those outside of our community, not within it. Given his fear and home situation, just telling him \u201cif you don\u2019t stop following me I am going to have to tell others about your sexual orientation for my own safety\u201d would have been enough to get him off your back.", "Eh, ESH. Moreso him than you, but nonetheless. Like, I'm not taking Tim's defense. I was also a victim of homophobic bullying and I think anybody who does that is a shitty, shitty person. They are the architects of their own unhapiness, and they have no right to forgiveness unless you're willing to give it to them. That being said, I think that outing someone carries a certain violence in that act, too, especially for someone from a more conservative place. Tim sucks, but what you did goes beyond self-defense and fully into the territory of not cool *at all*.", "NTA. Your safety comes first. It\u2019s unfortunate that the consequences of his harassment are so big I suppose. But what was the alternative? You aren\u2019t allowed to do anything to stop the harassment or protect yourself because he\u2019s hiding in the closet? Sorry but no.\n\nGenerally outing someone isn\u2019t appropriate. But you know what else isn\u2019t? Sexual harassment and stalking. \n\nHis actions had consequences. But it\u2019s important to remember it was his choice to act this way towards you. You were clear. You attempted to avoid him. You attempted to resolve the harassment. You were out of options. That\u2019s his fault, not yours.", "ESH. \nYTA for outing him. You knew damn well what you were doing when you share those specific screenshots.", "You feel like an AH because you were. \n\nNothing is forgivable about the way he treated you,  and he's not entitled to your attention or your forgiveness. \n\nBut you simply don't out other people. Ever. You did it to harm him, not to protect yourself.  And that makes you as bad as him.\n\nESH.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t \u201caccidentally out him\u201d like your title says, you purposefully outed him. \nThere was no reason for you to out him. It does no good other than to harm him personally. It doesn\u2019t make your life any safer (the exact opposite, because now he actually has a valid reason to harm you). \n\nHe was a total asshole for everything he did, and stalking you is wrong, but what you did had everything to do with hurting him like he hurt you and nothing to do with your safety or anything of the sort. You just wanted to harm your bully.", "ESH... I was on your side all the way, until you outted him... holy shit, man...", "ESH\n\nHe reacted poorly to the development of his own sexuality and took that out on you. He's *still* taking it out on you, with his refusal to take no for an answer and general creep behavior. But you intentionally (not accidentally) outed him and that is *never OK*.

That would be cruel and wrong. But he was **following you and threatening your safety**. You released that information to add context to why you believed your life was at risk.

You were just showing that indeed it was related to those things (even though he was never your partner, it shows that he had a romantic intention and soured).\n\nOP, I hope someone is taking your concerns seriously.

You weren't being taken seriously by officials who's job IS to take you seriously. You PROTECTED yourself the safest way you could. Everything else is on him.

Quite honestly I don\u2019t buy you\u2019re reasoning. I\u2019ve been in a similar position of being terrified of someone on my college campus that I went to high school with, someone who did physically hurt me prior. I never would\u2019ve considered retaliating or going public on social media specifically because that would aggravate the situation. \n\nWhy would you risk pissing him off when so far he\u2019d made no attempts to harm you? Did you not think that would escalate the situation? Why would social media do anything other than escalate the situation from his point of view? Why would you not take the concerning messages to administration? You had 9 months to gather evidence and present your case again.", "YTA.

I think I made a very stupid choice because now he'll just be angrier at me, this wasn't good for any of us.", "Thank you for pointing this out!

That OP should keep his secrets for him regardless of how he acts?", "I reported him to the dorm manager before, buy he said there was nothing weird as he lives there too, so of course he would probably get in around the same hours I did.

The cops also said I didn't had enough proof to get a restraining order.", "I would say that is absolutely terrible advice. It isn't the responsibility of a victim to try to fix their stalkers issues, and I can't imagine that going well.

It's frankly victim shaming to imply that if they just gave their poor desperate harasser some support, then they would'nt have hurt them.", "Im not sure about that.

Unfortunately OP is the one with the opportunity here.", ">he's the same as he was in school, but worse.\n\nBut not in terms of bullying, right? And now he seems to have an interest in connecting with you instead of making you feel bad? Those are huge differences.  It's totally reasonable he seems scary, especially with the stalking. But let's look at it from his perspective.\n\nHe's surely not in counselling, likely doesn't have any friends right now, and now his life feels like it's over. To him, you're probably the closest thing to a friend, or source of acceptance he can find. Especially in a conservative state and as a presumably masculine football player, he has no understanding of how to deal with his emotions.  So it results in stalking because he doesn't know what else to do, and he feels desperate and confused.\n\nAgain, your feelings are totally valid here, but this is a big opportunity to set him on a better path. You know how bad it is to be gay in a conservative state, so you  can empathize with his suffering. Plus, it will reduce the actual safety risk he poses to you, since he could very well think you've ruined his life, however misguided that may be.\n\nI'd suggest inviting him to get some coffee at a public place, and just chat with him for an hour or two, and see what you can do to set him up with other support systems - counselors, lgbt clubs at school, online support systems, etc. And also share your feelings about how he's intimidating, and how hard me made your life. He'll probably apologize, and if nothing else, he'll understand where you're coming from when you outed him. That will help him sooth his emotions. \n\nI get this is intimidating for you and you feel like it shouldn't be your problem. And both are true, but I think both you and he have a lot to potentially gain from talking things out. If you don't want to have any empathy for him, just like he had no empathy for you, at least have some empathy for yourself.", "but OP had proof of ss & those pics, I assume", "I think me being gay myself, I have a very different perspective than you do on what it means to \u201cout\u201d someone.  This is arguably the worst behavior a gay man can exhibit to another gay man. \n\nI do think you should confront someone before destroying their life, and I don\u2019t think too wrongs make a right. I am not sure when the verbal bully because someone that would \u201ckick the everliving snot out of you\u201d on a college campus and face no consequences? Especially considering there was no violent behavior after he did ruin the bully\u2019s life.", "I mean, I don't mean to undermine what he's put you through, either. I think you not only got put through hell, but he's also been harrassing you. I'd say it's like 10% you 90% him, because you weren't acting out vindictively but out of a sense of self-protection. That is a tough place to find yourself in.", "It sounds like you\u2019ve got a really good head on your shoulders. This might be something you regret doing when you look back on this in the future but Tim\u2019s behavior is completely out of line. He bullied you and then he harassed you. You asked for him to stop multiple times. You tried other means to stop his behavior. Sometimes the only choices people leave use to defend ourselves are choices we wouldn\u2019t normally make.", "How is outing him to all his social media protecting himself?", "Yes I know. But because someone do things to you, doesn\u2019t mean for you to one up them. Then you\u2019re both wrong at that point.", "MAybe YOU follwed him, like you outet him?", "I see, thank you, your comment is making me feel a little better.", "It doesn't matter why he is doing it, it only matters that he is. OP isn't a therapist, he is the victim. Whether or not the bully has a \"fetish for stalking\" or not, he has estabilished over the course of his entire life to be a dangerous person to OP. The bully's emotional wellness is not OP's responsibility.", "I mean this as a genuine question, if OP was a woman and was being stalked by an ex bully who she had rejected, would you tell her \"just give him a chance, he's just so lonely\"?", "This is absolutely garbage advice. OP's bullys behaviour is borderline obsessive. There is nothing to be gained by further interacting with them and quite frankly puts OP at great risk by furthering this persons fixation. You dont befriend people like this. Its fucking dangerous.", "No. Someone who repeatedly had ignored OP's wishes to be left alone should not be given this kind of grace, and legitimately opens OP up to potentially being assaulted.", "He outed the harassment on social media because the school doesn't believe him. The guy's sexuality wasn't the intended thing being outed, it just happened to be the context of said harassment. Not saying that the right or wrong thing to do, but I believe that was OP's thought process. It would be no different if a girl was being stalked by a guy and she made his behavior public because the school wasn't doing anything about it. Sometimes it takes a larger voice or public outcry to enact change in cases like this, or at least it helps dissuade the harasser from continuing to try and contact them", "How would you suggest he gotten him to back off then, since nothing he's said up till the outing worked and no one seemed to believe him? The fact that he claims to like OP makes it not just bullying but sexual harassment, and given they stay in the same dorm and it's been happening for months it's a very serious situation that could easily escalate to SA. Would it of been acceptable to out Tim when OP filed a police report for assault?", "You didn't ruin anything; the other bullies are making his life he'll. This isn't on you--definitely NTA. \n\nSince you did bring this up to campus admin before, I think it's worth going back to them to explain the situation now that there's been escalation. Clearly now there is more documentation and you may be able to get more support.", ">It doesn't matter why he is doing it\n\nIf you know why he's doing it, then you can stop it elegantly. If you ignore or further reject the bully, as you're suggesting, it is far more likely to escalate into a more dangerous situation.", "No, the homophobic context and history is key in this post", ">quite frankly puts OP at great risk by furthering this persons fixation\n\nOP just ruined this guy's entire life at home, albeit justifiably. Ignoring that is dangerous. \n\n>You dont befriend people like this\n\nI didn't say to befriend. I said to talk it out. You can have an adult discussion with someone about serious subjects without being their friend.", "That was my idea. At least I wanted somebody to know because I'm legitimately scared he might hurt me. I thought that I'd protect myself I'd I did this because he'll be scared to get near me in case someone would see him and recognize him. But I admit that what I did was wrong, I can only imagine how hurtful it must be to be outted against your will.", "You never ever give someone who displays obsessive behavior an inch, they will take a mile. You make yourself clear that you want nothing to do with them and refuse any further attempts at interaction. Any form of interaction otherwise will be seen as an opportunity to entrench themselves. Its especially foolish to try and \"talk it out\" as it will give the impression they are cared about.", "Eh I think he brought it on himself by behaving in such a toxic manner, both as your bully and trying to contact you. His sexuality being exposed is justifiable payback for all the pain he brought you. He didn't stop to think how hurtful it must be to be bullied for your sexuality every time he insulted you, so why should you feel bad?\n\nBtw, I wouldn't be surprised if he went to the same school you did on purpose. He clearly bullied you all those years because of his own repressed sexuality and is at least somewhat obsessed with you. I would try to file a restraining order with the police if possible.", "Why are you so certain talking it out is a bad idea? \n\nCouldn't it give the opportunity to OP to point out counselors, groups, and online support to the bully? Then, couldn't the bully improve and make more positive connections and no longer be a problem? You say talking it out could make them more obsessed, but isn't that going to happen every time the bully thinks of home, and blames OP anyway? This seems like something you have to actively stop instead of ignore.", "I've tried to fill a restraining order but the cops asked to talk to our dorm manager because I told them that I already had complained about Tim with them, they said nothing was going on and it was just a exaggeration. As I didn't had any big proof that he was putting my life in danger (he never physically attacked me, the messages weren't enough proof) they said they couldn't do nothing."]}
