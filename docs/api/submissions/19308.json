My boyfriend has some issues with drinking, and he\u2019s been in therapy for it since before I met him. \n\nWell, two nights ago, he came out and told me that he\u2019s slipped back into his heavy drinking problems and asked me to help support him in stopping. For background information, he asked me of this before a few months back in the form of asking every night if he drank or not. Admittedly, after a week or so I don\u2019t think I did it every night. Back to the present; when he asked me I said of course I\u2019ll support you in any way I can, but I need to know that you\u2019ll be honest with me and your therapist from now on. Cut to last night, I showed up at his apartment to surprise him and things were going well. When he got home he asked me not to \u201clet him\u201d go to the store or out the apartment at all so I was like \u201cokay sure.\u201d\n\nAbout maybe 30 minutes later he\u2019s saying he needs to go out and get something, and I responded with \u201cOh like what? I can go get it you just stay here and relax.\u201d This went on for like 10 minutes before I stood in front of the door like \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, I know you had something to drink while you were hanging out after work with your coworker, I don\u2019t want you out there.\u201d And I was getting really nervous at this point because I grew up with an alcoholic, and while I know it\u2019s a disease, I also know they will do just bout anything to get a drink. So while I\u2019m desperately trying to help him but also keep him and other drivers out there safe, he out of nowhere just hugs me and laughs like \u201crelax, it was just a test.  I wouldn\u2019t go out like this anyway.\u201d For context, he was shirtless and just wearing his shorts and he didn\u2019t have his wallet on him. But in my defense, 1)I don\u2019t know if he has cash in his car, 2) he was putting on his shoes, and 3)how the HELL am I supposed to think clearly when I\u2019m freaking out?\n\nI got mad at him and he said he was sorry but I just ignored him. Cut to later that night, he\u2019s trying to get all cuddly and I\u2019m still ignoring him and he\u2019s like \u201cokay, why are mad now.\u201d I told him how I felt and he said \u201cWell last time I asked you to help keep me in check you barely did it, and I thought you would at least be competent enough to understand I was joking with you when I did that test.\u201d I just got up and went to bed early and ignored him for the rest of the night. He tried asking me how that mad me more mad but I don\u2019t think he gets it.  He said that he wasn\u2019t calling me an idiot, he was just using proper English or whatever and he didn\u2019t mean to make me feel like he was insulting me.\n\nThis morning I found a note from him saying he was sorry and that if I want we can talk bout it later, and while I\u2019m still VERY mad at him, I also can\u2019t help but feel like an idiot for not seeing that he couldn\u2019t have left the apartment as he was.", "created_utc": 1686245603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144fkfa/aita_for_takin_my_bfs_test_too_literal/", "score": 257, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This man is so comfortable with his drinking that he has twisted it onto you being responsible. So now you don't even threaten to leave him for his drinking. Instead, you're the one at fault and therefore need to apologize to him when he does.\n\nGIRL PLEASE tell him you will dump his ass if he doesn't stop drinking, or actually do it. Life with an alcoholic is a very unhappy and draining experience. \n\nOpen your eyes to how badly he has manipulated you into staying.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What your BF is asking of you is EXTREMELY unfair and inappropriate. He doesn't get to put responsibility for his own decision making and destructive behaviors on you....that's not just support, that's total dependency. The fact that he took this need he has and decided to turn it into a 'test' of you is... alarming. He isn't in the right headspace to be in a relationship, and should be prioritizing both therapy and accountability for his actions.", "NTA, time to cut & run, you do not need to be dating an alcoholic in active addiction.  He has to hold himself accountable, he can\u2019t expect other people to stop him from drinking.  It\u2019s a safety issue, it puts you in danger.  You are susceptible to being in unhealthy relationships because of your upbringing and you should get counseling and go to Al-anon meetings to figure out what a healthy relationship looks like.  \n\nAlcoholics will absolutely leave their house wearing almost nothing, forgetting their wallet or phone, that\u2019s what drunk people do.", "NTA. This whole testing thing is a way for him to control you. You aren't in charge of protecting him from drinking so if that's his issue then he needs to deal with it by going to meetings. Your job isn't to continually ask him to do the right thing.", "NTA. If he's that immature that he's testing you then going on to say you took his joke test too seriously.... then you need to run.", "NTA - He shouldn't be testing you like that or relying on you to keep him sober. It's like he's setting it up to blame you if he drinks again. Drinking is his choice, and it is his choice to remain sober.", "NTA. You are NOT RESPONSIBLE for his sobriety!!  Do not take responsibility for this!! It is HIS ISSUE. He needs to work this out with a doctor and therapist- not make his gf of 8 months responsible.", "NTA. Tests are not appropriate in a relationship. This is not funny. He asked something that is very taxing and you agreed out of a desire to help someone you care for. His test was disrespectful.", "NTA- you are way to young to have to deal with his issues and act as his drinking accountability buddy. He needs to go to AA and get a sponsor so someone who is able to handle this can.", "NTA and this whole thing will crush you over time - first of all he needs to account for himself and have a support system outside of his girlfriend. Second, him doing stupid tests that (probably visibly) upset you and made you nervous are so counterproductive and weird? He wants to test if you can stop him this time? That\u2019s not your responsibility. \nSounds like quite the relationship, are you sure this is good for you?", "NTA But you're way too young to deal with this man. Walk away. You should be young, free and happy.", "NTA, I actually doubt this was a test.  feels more like he made that shit up after the fact.  Regaurdless, hes making it your responsibility to help him with his problem and seems very capable of blaming you for his fuck ups with it.  you re far too young to be getting weighed down by a man who cant get a handle on his life.", "NTA you\u2019re only 19. Get out now.", "NTA he\u2019s an AH and you should run from that. It\u2019s not worth it.", "Nta. What he did was manipulative and honestly kind of sick. I would have a serious talk with him.", "NTA. My ex tried to make his drinking my responsibility too. OP, it is not your job to control him. You need to ask yourself if this is what you want in life, because he's not going to change unless he wants to and this doesn't sound like he wants to. This sounds like him setting things up to blame you for his own shortcomings down the road. This sounds abusive, gaslighting. When people act weird, sometimes it's pushing boundaries to see what they can get away with. Please research codependency (recommend reading \"codependent no more\").", "NTA. He wants you to take this seriously but he's treating it like a joke. Relationship tests are always toxic", "NTA This wasn't fair to you. Nobody should have to be in a relationship and wonder if a situation is real or they're being tested. It also shows that your boyfriend has a lot more issues than alcoholism. You're 19, and this relationship seems toxic. Honestly, until your boyfriend is able to work through these issues, it's unfair of him to put so much pressure on you; his sobriety is not something that you should feel like is entirely on you. I'm glad he's in therapy, and ideally he'll be open and honest with them about his behaviors, no just with addiction, but with the way he's behaving in general.", "HIS sobriety is not your responsibility.  He needs AA and a sponsor. YOU need to go to Al-anon and/or ACOA (adult children of alcoholics) to learn not to get sucked into their drama. You can be supportive without letting them blame you for their failure. And you weren't foolish, an alcoholic doesn't care if they are dressed inappropriately to go buy booze. He had no right to \"test\" you if that is actually what he was doing. More likely he was hoping you'd let it slide and since you didn't he had to cover his tracks by blaming you.", "NTA: He needs to cut off those friends immediately. He probably shouldn't be in a relationship until he begins taking his sobriety seriously. Not healthy for either of you. I hope he gets the help he needs and I hope you're able to prioritize yourself. You don't need to take care of anyone.", "NTA. \n\nPlease, just move on. You don\u2019t have to deal with this toxic behavior.", "NTA - This is not a healthy relationship.", "NTA run away quickly", "\ud83d\udea9 everywhere", "I tried dating someone in recovery. Until they are ready to be sober themselves, it\u2019s never going to work. You can make sure he doesn\u2019t leave the house, take his card, what have you. They will STILL find a way to do the things they want. \n\nYou\u2019re young. You have your whole life (hopefully) to have to make real life decisions. Making sure your boyfriend is sober shouldn\u2019t be one of them. It\u2019ll hurt you, cause you unnecessarily stress. \n\nPlease reconsider this relationship.\n\nEdit for verdict- NTA", "You can't be responsible for keeping him sober, you can try to do things like keep his keys so he doesn't drive but even that can only go so far. His drinking is his responsibility, only he can decide not to do it. You shouldn't have to stress out about his choices and frankly his test was horrible and manipulative. NTA for being upset, but really take a step back and think what advice you'd give a friend in your situation.", "NTA, but your boyfriend needs a competent sponsor to keep him in check instead of making you responsible for managing his disease. You should look into Al anon meetings that will help you with past trauma from your father and a better understanding of what supporting your bf actually looks like. Therapy may not be enough for bf, but no one can make him go to a meeting anymore than they can stop him from drinking.", "NAH\n\nI can totally see how you would be annoyed over this, but it seems like he has good intentions and already apologized twice... it really doesn't seem like he was at all wanting to upset you.\n\nThe real issue is that you are now in a relationship with someone that you know is going to need a lot of support and will probably put you in some difficult positions as he tries to deal with his drinking.  That is a lot to take on, being both his girlfriend and his quasi-therapist, and it will probably be a lot of work and stress so you need to think about if you want to be in that position.", "No tests, try communication\nESH", "NTA. He\u2019s being manipulative and awful. I have deeply personal experience with loving an alcoholic. From the bottom of my soul, sincerely: PLEASE leave now.", "Everyone else will hit all the details of his controlling behavior, so I will only say 2 things. First, his sobriety is HIS responsibility. Second, Al-Anon. \n\nNTA. Take care of yourself", "You cannot be responsible for keeping another person from drinking.  He should not be putting it onto you as when he falls you are to blame because you did not stop him.  NTA.

Defining support as you taking on responsibility for him drinking and keeping him in the house.\n\n3. Testing that support by making you physically stand against him.\n\n4. Testing you at all. Ever.\n\n5. Drinking when he went out after work when he claimed to want to not drink.\n\nListen, there is a difference between a relapse and a cycle of addiction. He is still in the cycle. You are not responsible for him not drinking. He is responsible and he isn't taking responsibility at all! When you're not physically stopping him he drinks. Add to all of that putting you in a position where you have to stand in the doorway *puts you in physical danger and sets up an excuse for if/when he harms you in the future!*  \n\nHe's also setting up a situation wherein every time he drinks it's your fault for \"not supporting him.\" Please keep yourself safe and keep us updated.", "NTA\n\nWhy do you put yourself in this position? People see red huges fing flags and go \"yeees\"", "NTA \n\nOthers have said it all already so just gonna tell you that you can\u2019t save someone else, but you can sure ruin your own life trying", "I quit both drinking and smoking while I was already together with my current SO.\n\nShe supported me a lot, but I never made her responsible for my actions.\n\nTests and ultimatums have no place in a relationship. it's an enormous red flag, and for me, it would be a dealbraker.\n\nNTA.", "NTA except to yourself. You are investing so much energy into his problem and into finding excuses for his shitty behavior. \n\nYou are not responsible for him.

Are you sure this is a relationship you want to be in?\n\nHe's trying to make it your responsibility to stop him from leaving the house, put you in an anxiety inducing situation on purpose to see if you would stop him, you take him seriously (he wanted you to) and then said you're incompetent for taking him seriously.\n\n\"I wanted to see if you would do your job and take me seriously but also I didn't think you were stupid enough take me seriously\" \n\nIs what it is when you put it in simple terms, those mind games are out of control and he's priming you to take responsibility and to feel guilty for his drinking.\n\nRun for the hills tbh", "wake up and break up", "You grew up with an alcoholic...why are you even bothering with this guy?

This is his first time ever testing me like this, and honestly I think it was one of his idiot friends idea seeing as how it was one of them that got him back into drinking too.", "And I know that last bit personally, I\u2019ve seen my father in that state countless times so of course I would take what my bf was doing literal. I\u2019m looking into getting back into counseling for separate reasons but I should definitely still get into it. The thing is that he hasn\u2019t been an active alcoholic since his high school days, that\u2019s what he told me at least. The only reason why he\u2019s relapsed into it is because an idiot friend of his told him to just LIE to his therapist, and I plan on telling him exactly how I feel about this and how if he wants actual help, he needs to get into AA and be forthcoming with his therapist completely from now on.", "I plan on including that in our conversation later, that if he wants accountability he can go to AA. I\u2019ll be there the support him but I am not the system.", "This is his first time doing anything like this, so I can\u2019t help but think one of his idiot friends put it into his head.

I\u2019ll gladly support him and be a shoulder for him if he needs me but I am not his warden and he is not my charge. I dealt with being a mother to my father i will not go through it again with him and he KNOWS that too", "He\u2019s never done anything liek this before, so as much as I hate to be that girl I believe I can help him in recognizing how much he messed up last night. I plan on laying down a lot of boundaries and rules from now on because he not only broke my trust but really hurt my feeling with this. He is in therapy, but I want him to start doing AA too because I can\u2019t be his main support system, obviously.", "I fully plan on it. I already have a rough draft in my notes on what I plan on saying to him when he gets off work. Not only did he make me think he doesn\u2019t trust me to support him, it also broke MY trust for him cause what\u2019s to say he won\u2019t do it again?", "That\u2019s exactly how I feel too, that now I\u2019ve been tested once who\u2019s to say he won\u2019t do it again. I also feel like he doesn\u2019t trust ME enough to support him through this, and I plan on telling him that later as well as setting boundaries and rules because I would like us to work out, but if push comes to shove I might just leave.", "I saw that earlier, AI, I\u2019ve never heard of it, is it a support group of sorts?  And yeah I agree, I worry that either he needs a different therapist or needs to either go to AA too or rehab all together, but you\u2019re also right in saying no body can make him, not even  me", "I want to be there to support him, I want to see him be better and happier with himself. I\u2019ve told him before he needs to be completely forthright with his therapist, the whole reason why he even started drinking again was cause some idiot friend of his got it into his head to lie to the therapist about drinking", "I keep reading about that, is AI some sort of support group?", "I would honestly think about whether you really want to stay in this relationship. You spent your childhood having to deal with an alcoholic, but you didn't have a choice then.

Don't get sucked in by another alcoholic man. There's better ones out there.", "You have absolutely no role in his sobriety other than to not encourage it. In the same way that no one can control others, you cannot truly stop someone from drinking if they themselves don't.\n\nTake a step back and try to focus on your own life.

He's old enough to know to not lie to his therapist, he's old enough to know not to always listen to his friends but he still is.....

If you had healthy boundaries that you enforce, you wouldn\u2019t be with him.", "And this is coming from someone who had issues with drinking myself; I would never make my husband responsible for my actions or pull this weird shit.", "You sound like you're really going above and beyond with how you're supporting him and that should be commended. You're absolutely doing the right thing communicating with him about how that made you feel and how it does have consequences, plus setting boundaries. I'd also consider telling him that you want a guarantee that he's going to talk to his therapist about the \"test\", because he really needs to work through the fact that he felt the need to test someone who's been there for him.

Break up with him because this is manipulative (also the whole just using proper English is bullshit, he was testing your limits of how much bullshit you\u2019ll take from him).

Unbelievably childish and manipulative behavior.", "NTA for any of it. Your bf is trying to make it your problem and responsibility to keep him in check. An addict doesn't say \"You'd better grill me all day every day about whether or not I have used, bc then if I have used it will be your fault for not staying on me about it.\" If someone wants to use ( I was addicted to opiates for over 10 years!) then they will, and they will simply lie about it. You asking him every time is not going to help him, or you, or your relationship bc it's putting you in a motherly caregiver role. Eventually he will resent you constantly asking him, you will get sick of being expected to always ask him, then what if he does drink and lies about it? Asking him after the fact isn't going to prevent it from happening in the first place.\n\nIf he is going to try to \"test you\" to make sure you'd support him then I would say he is not utilizing therapy correctly lol, bc a therapist would never suggest any of the shit he is requesting of you as tools for maintaining sobriety. What he *should do* is start attending AA meetings and getting a sponsor. A sponsor is someone experienced in alcoholism and relapse, and will be a simple phone call away for him if he feels the urge to buy alcohol or relapse. He should educate himself on addiction and alcoholism, since he clearly has had issues with it before he was even of legal age to drink, and likely is not fully aware of it's damage to your body.\n\nInstead, you could draw attention to any issues if you happened to notice the scent of alcohol on him when you see him, or go to some meetings with him to support him in his sobriety, but you are not expected to block the door if he's trying to leave the damn house...\n\nIf you have a past with alcoholic parents you could also be aupprtive in doing some research into Al-Anon for family members of addicts. Sometimes we think we are helping but in fact we are enabling addicts with our behaviors.", "Do you want your future to constantly look like this? Do you want to be in a parental/therapist type role in a relationship? Is this responsibility attractive to you? Is this stress worth it? \n\nSeems like you\u2019re on a slippery slope.

The fact that you have some trauma from addiction in your family makes this even worse.\n\nNTA but I would not move past this", "ESH He doesn't need someone to mother him.
