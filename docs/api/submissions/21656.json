My daughter is having two parties (one family, one friends) and a freaking trip to Disneyland. \n\nNTA. Make their childhoods magical.", "Remind your eldest that she never had to \"share\" her birthday with anyone else- she had everyone's undivided attention. Your twins obviously have to share every year- a special trip for each shows you see them as individuals, not just \"twins\". NTA", "Your plans sound lovely and thoughtful. NTA", "NTA.   Different people want different things for their birthdays, and twins have to share SO much that it's perfectly reasonable to allow them each a gift of an activity with a friend in addition to their party.   \n\n\nI do think you should talk to your oldest daughter alone (AWAY from the grandparents) and get to the bottom of her jealousy over her younger sisters.  Sometimes, there can be resentment from an older sibling of twins, both because twins naturally get a lot of attention due to being twins, and also because parents tend to be stretched thin with two  kids in the same stage at the same time, and an older singleton can feel ignored.   19 is a bit old to be jealous of her 10-year-old sisters' birthday arrangements, though, so I feel like an in-depth conversation is needed.", "NTA a lot of kids get two birthdays: one with friends, one with family. Also, both kids only do the zoo or cinema with one friend, so it's also not a big event.", "NTA. Tell them that the kids are getting one party (the family one with cake), and an outing each as one of their birthday gifts.", "NTA. It sounds like you're treating them all fairly.", "NTA. I think it's great that you are recognising the twins as individuals and giving them reasonable separate birthday outings with friends.", "NTA. You\u2019re not giving them 3 birthdays. Each gets 2 events, one with a friend and one with family. It\u2019s only 3 because there\u2019s 2 of them. If your oldest hadn\u2019t wanted a huge birthday party she could have had the same. But kids want different things! If you made the twins have their birthday outing combined, neither of them would get the day to themselves so they\u2019d actually get less than the oldest (if we\u2019re counting and I don\u2019t think that makes sense).", "NTA, I would say those are not three parties, there\u2019s one party and one outing each, doing something they are interested in. That seems entirely reasonable to me!", "NTA, just because their birthday is the same, doesn\u2019t mean their interests or friends are the same; as you have pointed out they clearly are very different in personality. Your oldest could always come to the parties too! Although, I\u2019m confused why 3 parties, one for Allison and one for Jade. Who gets the third party?", "Disclaimer: I am not a twin, and I don't have children who are... but\n\nI would think that each of your children have different needs and wants, regardless of two of them being twins. A lot of people just expect that twins live in each others pockets and want to do everything together, and see twins as the same person - this is obvious from the comments you have made. \n\nThere are two birthdays, so why shouldn't they have two separate parties - they are their own person.", "NAH\n\nWorst case, you guys disagree. Objectively, no one's saying or doing anything on an asshole-level here.\n\n> My parents and their older sister don't think this is fair. The twins are essentially getting two parties each, whereas my eldest (19) only got one day to herself for her birthdays.\n\nThe thing is, birthdays are **not** a *zero-sum* game.", "INFO: Are you throwing three completely different parties or are the girls just having a fun day with their friends as a gift? Does your eldest get a similar \"gift\"? I would assume the shopping trips is similar.", "Well the way you wrote 3 parties is somewhat misleading. The twins want to do different activities which is understandable. \n\nThe main bday party is actually only 1 party for both.  It\u2019s a bit mixed cause you actually giving the twins more attention than your eldest which likely stems from u being a twin, which is why it can look as unfair.", "I'm a twin who has completely different interests to my sister.\n\nYTA, it's not fair on the older sibling and it's a bit over the top. Give them a birthday party with their family and friends. But if they want to see a film or go to the zoo then that's just a day out/activity and there's no need to make more parties out of it. They can do that whenever just as a normal activity.", "Nta but maybe take the oldest out for a treat too if they're in any way bothered. I doubt they even care, at 19 kids birthdays tend to be irrelevant.", "Yes that annoying YTA. You will be raising very entitled kids if you spoil them this way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your 19 year old gets one day for her birthday, Jade gets one day for her birthday, and Allison gets one day for her birthday. Then the family party which is for all the relatives. Sounds pretty fair to me. Also at 19 why does your eldest care? When I was 19, 10 year olds were children, my youngest sibling (12) was a child, not someone to be jealous over. Why do your parents care? They\u2019re against children doing what they enjoy on their birthday?", "I\u2019m a twin too. I HATE BIRTHDAYS and you know exactly why. You are correcting so many wrongs.

If the oldest was a twin I\u2019m sure you would have done the same for her.", "NTA. As you said, your twins are becoming different people. Taking a day to allow each of them to do the thing they enjoy with a friend and then having a shared party seems like a great plan, IMO.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to other people. As long as you, your twins, and your eldest are all fine with it. What\u2019s the problem?", "I apologise, English is not my first language so things can be a bit confusing.", "Did the eldest get to do something with a friend as well as something with family?\n\nIf so then this is already fair.\n\nIf not, which is she missing? Is she sad that she didn't get a family party? Does she feel like the wider family care more about the twins than her?", "Right? OP seems like a sane and rational parent who genuinely treats her kids equitably. Rare on this sub.", "Part of the issue, which was confirmed by a therapist about 18 months ago, is that when the twins were born, I chose to become a SAHM for the first 6 years, then went back to work part time when they turned 6. When my eldest, Sophie, was young, I was a SAHM for 3 years, and returned to work full time after that, so our household income was higher for a long time and we admittedly spoiled her a lot more than we spoil the twins.\n\nOur household income was cut in half, and as a result, we didn't take her on big outings anymore. We used to regularly go to waterparks on random weekend, or pick her up a toy because we thought she'd like it. It was explained to her in an appropriate way when the twins were born that it would be a bit different for a few years and it turned into a little bit of resentment towards the twins. \n\nMy husband and I still took her on separate days out and one combined, but it got a lot more simple, such as getting lunch or seeing a movie in the cinema, not as extravagant or flashy as what they were, but we still wanted to make her feel special and loved. This started when Allison and Jade were newborns and has continued. Its something we still do to this day but have started doing it with the twins because we want to make sure they know that they're allowed to be two separate people.\n\nSo, Sophie went from being having a lot of attention, and large outings to it slowly dwindling down over the course of 8 months. We did our absolute best to ease her into being a big sister and a kid friendly way of explaining why it was happening, but she harbours some resentment towards the twins.", "A friend of mine grew up with separated parents, she got 4! Mum and dad hated each other, so they'd throw her a big party each with friends, then one with family, she still brags about it and she's nearly 50!", "Growing up as a twin, I was often forced to do things with my sister even when we didn't want to spend the time together. Not just by our parents, but by teachers, sports coaches, friends even. If one of us was going to an event, the other had to go, despite having enough bedrooms in the house, we were forced to share. It caused a huge rift until we were in our 20s and left home. \n\nI don't want that for my girls ever, I've read enough stories here on reddit about forced relationships almost never working out and I don't see it as fair. Allison and Jade have never been forced to share (I'll admit, I did dress them in matching outfits a few times before they could form opinions for my own enjoyment), anything they share, they've chosen to.", "This is the first year we've tried something like this for them. On previous years it's been simple, only one day for the two and they've both wanted to do the same thing or were willing to compromise with very little bickering, but that was honestly because Jade is the leader is the pack. Up until a few months ago, Allison would happily go with whatever Jade wanted to do, as long as it was something she also enjoyed, but recently started to voice what she wants to do more and stick to it. This is fairly normal for twins, or even just kids in general.", "That's the family event with cake, etc. Both twins will be there.", "They both get the 3rd one. It'll be on their actual birthday, some aunts, cousins and grandparents will come over for a birthday dinner and cake.", "We've never bought our children toys for their birthdays. It's always been a thing they want that's not a toy, they always got a lot from family/friends. \n\nFor my eldest, she loved swimming growing up. She had lots of real parties that often had 10+ children invited, that was her gift from us as they could work out rather expensive, with us having to pay per child, plus food and other expenses. Cake with family would always happen for her as well, but it was usually held at my parents house because that's what they wanted to do for her", "I'm not really sure what to call the event. None of them are truly a party. Just separate days out, but they are the events that have been chosen for the birthday, and are happening on 3 separate dates.", "How is it raising entitled kids to acknowledge that two separate individuals enjoy different things? They're twins, not a single entity.", "She's not giving each of them a separate party and then one together.

I just mean, that doesn't sound unreasonable!", "They weren\u2019t criticising your English. :)\n\nThey were criticising your parents / oldest daughter who are saying the twins are \u201cgetting 3 parties\u201d.\n\nThey\u2019re not getting 3 parties. They\u2019re having one family party, and then are each doing an activity they enjoy with a friend. \n\nNTA", "A movie and a trip to the zoo, each with one friend, is just an outing, not a party. In my opinion.", "Your English is very good.", "That\u2019s great that you\u2019re listening to them! Giving kids an event with friends and one with family is totally normal, there just happen to be two kids.", "NTA then. It just seems like you're treating your children the same. I don't think your parents and eldest daughter would complain if they weren't twins.", "Then they aren't parties and that's ok! Have the \"party\" be with your family and they can invite whichever friends they like, make that the event with the cake and the birthday presents etc. \n\nThen just let them have their days out separately. You can go to a zoo anytime and films usually run in cinemas for a few weeks. Why even think of it as three parties? One is a birthday party the others are just kids being kids days out", " It just seems like you're treating your children the same.", "I wouldn't be taking them for the day out like this unless it was a special occasion, its for their birthday."]}
