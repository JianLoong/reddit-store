But as I'm older I'm more or less able to choose who I stay with.\n\nI'm not a particular fan of going to my mother's. I love her and all, but it's very boring. I always sleep in the spare room, which is tiny and has nothing in it. I HAD a room there, but she made me give it up so one of my half-siblings could have a room (the half sibling in question shared a room with his brother). I tried protesting that he can just share a room with his brother still until I got my own place, but my mum called me selfish and just kicked me out of my room.\n\nI have nothing there. Even when I had a room all that was really in it was a DVD player and a few other things (she threw that all out once I started spending more time with my dad). I don't have a laptop, football or really anything there, as my mum has always said I have all those things at my dad's(I'm also not allowed to take those things down mum's). She says me visiting now is about us having quality time together. Mind you she never takes me anywhere, she just expects me to sit and chat, and apparently I'm too old for kiddy things like a gaming console? And when I'm there she pampers her 3 other kids (8,8, and 6) and never me, saying I don't need so much attention. I also hardly speak to my stepdad.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, is pretty much the opposite. I have a laptop, PS5, and fun things like footballs and action figures (I use as decorations on my shelf). My dad is a funny, cool guy who never seems to be in a bad mood. I have a good room, and a little sister 4f. My stepmum is really nice, we all go on holidays together, always doing something nice when I'm there.\n\nRecently I was up my mum's for about 3 days. She asked me why I spend about a week and a half at dad's and only a couple at hers. I told her how I just prefer being at dad's, as there's always things to do and I have an overall better relationship. She become rather angry, saying I'm a spoiled brat and I'm babied and whatnot. I wasn't trying to offend her, but AITA? Am I actually a spoiled brat?\n\nEdit: I also don't have a very close relationship with my half siblings on my mother's side.

I\u2019m happy that you have such a great relationship with your Dad and stepmom. Your mom sounds kind of terrible and selfish. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, you seem like a really intelligent, mature person who is in touch with what you need.", "NTA\n\nWhy don't you write your mom a letter detailing what you have explained here. Then suggest if she wants to spend time with you, the TWO meet for lunch one day a week. You can chat, get all her attention, she gets all your attention and you work on a relationship independent of her other kids. Her response will probably tell you how invested she is in your relationship.", "NTA. She puts no effort into the relationship or treating you well and is far more preoccupied with your half siblings. Meanwhile your dad puts in the work and treats you better. \n\nShe is blaming you for her own failures.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even about the material stuff. You dad is *available* to you as a parent and a family. \n\nNo parent who is emotionally available makes their child feel as out of place as your mom has.\n\n16 is also an incredibly appropriate age to choose where you would rather be. She needs to get over her feelings so maybe saying less is more in these regards. You love her, but dad has more availability right now for you. Mom is busy with the three other kids", "NTA, your mom is. Just look at the difference between your two families.   \n\n\nYour father engages you, as well as your stepmom. You have a room, and stuff, and likely have no concern with any of it disappearing. I'm not surprised your father and step-mother have you keep your stuff there. They are likely concerned that your mother would damage or even destroy anything you bring to her house.   \n\n\nYour mother doesn't engage you, and expects you to take a back seat to your half-siblings. I'm betting she took your room away because you had already started pulling back from spending time there due to her unfair balance of attention between you and your half-siblings. Now she's claiming you are spoiled because in her mind that excuses her horrible behavior towards you. It's not true. Don't believe her.", "NTA. When you're at your mother's place, she treats you like a second class citizen. Your lodgings are low on her priority list, she restricts your belongings, and she restricts what you can do. Your dad would have to be pretty bad to fail to exceed the bar your mother set. She has no basis for being angry at you for realizing that her treatment of you is subpar. Don't pander to her delusions. At 16, you might even be able to skip the visits to her house.", "NTA. Your dad just appreciates you more", "NTA.  She asked a question, you answered honestly and it sounds like you were respectful about it.\n\nHer reaction is a good example of why you have the preference you do. Hopefully she'll figure that out soon and change her behavior, but I wouldn't hold your breath.", "NTA. You just honestly answered where you like spending time, you don't have to feel sorry for having your own opinion", "NTA and since you get to choose, I'd choose dad's.", "You are not a spoiled brat. Your Mom sounds like a dog in the manger. Doesn't want something, but won't let anyone else have it.\n\nBasically, she doesn't want really want you to live in her house and become part of her new family, but she also doesn't want your Dad to have you. She wants to be your favorite parent because it makes her feel better about herself and absolves her of any guilt for neglecting you.\n\nWhat you want and need is not as important to her as her own feelings. Go live with your Dad and if your Mom wants a relationship with you, let her make the effort to put her child's needs before her selfish desires.", "NTA. You have every right for your feelings. If she wants you wanting to be at her place more, she should behave according to it.", "It's impressive that at an early age, you've figured out that it's better to spend time and have deep relationships with people who treat you well and respect you, than with people who treat you badly and disrespect you.   This doesn't make you a spoiled brat, it makes you sensible and mature.\n\nIf this were just about material things, I might respond differently.  But this is about being with the family that includes you, loves you, doesn't call you names, and pays attention to your needs and wants.\n\nStick with your lovely dad and kind step-mother.  They treat you like the valuable person you are.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSeems like yout mom decided what you need without actually knowing you and seeing what you need. She'll flip out every time you ask for more than she thinks you deserve, which is apparently a lot less than you need. I'm glad at least your dad gets you.", "Your mother apparently favors the younger children over you.\n\nHaving gaming console is not a kiddy thing.  Plenty of adults have a gaming console.  It does sound boring at your mother's house.\n\nShe has said you don't need so much attention.  But how does she expect a 16 M to entertain himself while at that house?\n\nNTA.", "Nta but you may have been able to handle the situation better. Have you tried telling her how you feel? Is it your dad that doesn't let you take your things to your mums?", "For sure having 3 kids with 8,8 and 6 yo is exhausting to your mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
