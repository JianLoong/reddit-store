Then suggest if she wants to spend time with you, the TWO meet for lunch one day a week.

I'm betting she took your room away because you had already started pulling back from spending time there due to her unfair balance of attention between you and your half-siblings.

When you're at your mother's place, she treats you like a second class citizen. Your lodgings are low on her priority list, she restricts your belongings, and she restricts what you can do.

She wants to be your favorite parent because it makes her feel better about herself and absolves her of any guilt for neglecting you.\n\nWhat you want and need is not as important to her as her own feelings.

She won't let you bring stuff there. Her only engagement with you is sitting and talking. Her husband and your half-siblings go out and play away from you when you are there.\n\nHere's a couple of questions to ask yourself...\n\nWhen you look through her house, how much evidence of you do you see there? Or put another way, if a stranger were to walk through the house, how much about you could they learn by doing so? Could that stranger even tell that you live there?\n\nMy guess would be \"not much\" twice and \"probably not\". That her house has become for you a place to visit her (on her terms) but not a place for you to live.\n\nIf there is no \"you\" in the house, why should you consider it a home to want to go to? Which is what you were telling her.\n\nI have to wonder if all of this may have started because your mom was angry, hurt, upset that you are spending more time with your dad? You mentioned that stuff was thrown away after you started staying with your dad more. I suspect the room thing was after that also.\n\nThe timing of it brings the thought that she was seeing you develop a life away from her (and with your dad to boot) and reacted to it by actions and behaviors that pushed you further away. Which can become a vicious cycle. She pushes away. You draw further away because of it. She pushes further. You draw further away. \n\nIf that is what has happening, your response to the recent question would have been a cut to the quick for her. A confirmation of fears that you are pulling away.\n\nIt does not matter that with the disparity of your life in the two homes, just about anyone could have predicted your answer. It does not matter that the disparity is largely due to her actions and behaviors. It would only matter that you said exactly what she would not want to hear.\n\nThe real question in this all may the simple question of \"Do your mom actually want you there?\" Her question to you say that the answer is \"Yes, she does.\" but your description of your life in her household suggests that the answer is \"No, she does not.\" (I hate to have to say that, but it really does suggest it.)\n\nAsking her the question may cause her to react badly again, but it is the ultimate question that she needs to answer for herself.  Because if she really does want the answer to be \"Yes, she wants you there\", she needs to face that her actions do not match her words.", "OP can you expand on what you said when she asked you? I mean did you pretty much say they're more things to do and You have an overall better relationship at your dad's,... Or were you paraphrasing?\n\nMy question is more, what was your phrasing for your answer?", "This behavior, Mom.  This right here is why.  He doesn\u2019t call me names.  He doesn\u2019t judge me.  He doesn\u2019t throw away my stuff.  He makes it fee like my home.  NTA", "NTA. You should be sharing your feelings with your mom, she's your MOM. She doesn't sound like a very emotionally mature person if her reaction to you giving her an honest answer resulted in her having a tantrum. \n\nYou are just as deserving of attention as your half siblings and I'm sorry she's not there for you as much as she should be.", "NTA. She made room for your step siblings but not for you.", "Yeah, I'm playing the witcher 3 on my switch right now. Really not a game for kids lol.", "Why are you so hell bent on him losing his relationship with his mom. He wants to see her and loves her. She may not be as attentive as he wants but she isn't abusive. I don't see a reason here worth completely cutting her off.

OP is NTA.", "Honestly, I worked so hard to make a room my stepkids would like visiting and staying at. I always had a list of potential fun things to do, as well - which we didn't always do, but there were options.\n\nHearing your Mom puts no effort into making her home a welcoming place with a room dedicated to you and your interests makes me sad.\n\nI agree with others. Make an offer to spend quality time together, but avoid the overnights with nothing to do but mope in an empty tiny room (I would mope, too!). So, do lunch, or a movie, or skiing, or go to the beach, or go carts... just the two of you, or don't go.\n\nNTA", "NTA She shouldn't ask questions she doesn't want to know the answer to. It doesn't sound like it's all about things she can't afford to buy you. Your dad sounds like a good guy.", "NTA, you're a young person who is entitled to how they feel. You told your mom the truth, it's not really your problem if she doesn't like what she's hearing. To offset that, it's great your relationship with your stepmom is very good.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your mother was never keen on bonding with her child, and rather she wanted someone she could \"bond with\" like an adult. Kids generally like to bond over their exploits, their hobbies, and the things they **do** together while adults tend to prefer meet and mingles. Plus, even if we allow for the whole \"sit and chat\" thing, she should be doing other stuff with you. If she can't do that then she doesn't have room for you. Frankly the, \"you don't need attention\" line was a self-report entirely on her part.\n\nOverall it just sounds like you're getting what you need from your dads family. Sure the material stuff is what you focus on, because you're 16 and it's expected, but if one household treats you like a member that is cherished and the other shoves you in a hall closet and treats you like your an annoyance to have around while twofacedly claiming they want you around then clearly you're not getting that feeling of acceptance from your mother.\n\nIf anything, it was rather...classless of your mother to flip out when she received an honest and frankly not overly harsh response. Insulting you like that and calling you babied just shows she doesn't really think you deserve to be treated like someone with individual wants or needs.", "NTA It doesn't even sound like she likes you. Why would you want to spend time at her place with nothing to do except to talk to someone who doesn't seem to like you, mother or not? If she has any other reason for acting like a total ass to you when you point out reality, it may be that she has a smidgen of guilt about how much of an ass she really is normally and hates you mentioning it.", "You know you're NTA\nWhat does she expect you to do when you're there......", "NTA your mother is not good to you. I would keep doing what you're doing and if she can't realize on her own that she's a problem then stay away from her.", "NTA, sounds like at her house you'd have about the same amenities available in solitary confinement.

Please go stay with your dad full time with a clear conscience. You are still a child that needs a parent and I am glad your dad is there for you.", "Well I don\u2019t understand! When I married my husband over 30 years ago he had a daughter- his number 1 priority. When we married she became OUR number 1 priority. When I had our son we then had 2 #1 priorities - she did not become less important to either of us! We shared custody with her mom, but that didn\u2019t mean she had less than at our house. Her room was equal to her brothers, filled with her things the same as if we had her full time. It was HER ROOM in her home! It wasn\u2019t her fault she had to have 2 rooms at two houses! Shame on your step father for not including you, it\u2019s utter bullshit that he allowed you to be ousted from your room and your belongings taken away. But mostly your mother is the asshole here! Parenting isn\u2019t a competition, if she sees you prefer to live mostly elsewhere she needs to examine her choices and act accordingly- she\u2019s the adult, she made the selfish and shrewish choices that made you feel unwelcome and unhappy there. If my step daughter had not wanted to be with us as much as her mom I would\u2019ve known her dad and I were failing her, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have criticized her for it. Or name called! I\u2019m so sorry you have a mom and step dad that are being such lousy parents. It is not for one second your fault, she is wrong and lying to herself. Your only job is to be a happy successful KID, and that\u2019s not happening in the environment she provides you.
