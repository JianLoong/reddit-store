I asked if she still wanted to go and mentioned that we could still cancel and get the majority of our money back and only lose the \u00a3100 deposit. \n\nShe said no and that she'd be alright and that she just needs to get it over with and tell them. She didn't mention it anymore and then the morning that we were due to drive to the airport for our eening flight she says she can't go. She said she she's anxious and feels bad for her parents. \n\nI point out there's it's not like she would have given them the money she spent on the holiday anyway and the holiday is already paid so there's nothing she can do with that money for her parents. She just repeats that she cant go and that we have to cancel the holiday. \n\nLater in the day she mentions the fact we've both lost a lot of money and I just mention to her that I don't think it's fair for me to lose nearly \u00a31000 because she decided to cancel. She asks what I'm saying and I just say that I think she should reimburse me since she was the one who reassured me she was fine when I mentioned cancelling while we could still get the money. \n\nShe said I was being greedy and cruel and that I was out of order for expecting to be reimbursed but I just pointed out we've only lost the money because she cancelled the holiday last minute.

That just does not scan.\n\nI would be insisting she pay my money back and telling her it is over. Even speak to her parents tell them what she has done and you expect your money back.\n\nI bet she had no spending money either.\n\n~~I would have considered going any way and having a nice 10 days, meeting new people and having fun~~.\n\nEdit: just seen your follow up to another reply, She was the lead passenger", "NTA she cant just cancel when you're driving to the airport, she should have made up her mind earlier. you probably should have just gone on your own though", "NTA Mostly based on your comment that you couldn't make any changes to the package deal within 48 hours of departure.\n\nI can't imagine canceling a trip (with what I consider a pretty flimsy excuse) the day of departure. It's not like she was sick or had an accident. Now you're out a lot of money that was easily avoidable if she had decided not to go a few days earlier.\n\nYou should edit your post about not being able to make changes to the package 48 hours prior to departure.", "NTA. She blew it here. You two ended up spending that money anyway, and don't have anything to show for it, just because your GF is afraid to enjoy life, because, somehow, doing so is rubbing her parents faces in it, and it would be better to be miserable? She should see someone over her hangups.", "NTA. You gave her every opportunity to cancel and get almost your full trip refunded or plan for someone else to accompany you instead. She chose the day of to pull this shit. Not only is that super frustrating and a let down, but to not reimburse you is so messed up.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nWere it me, I'd have a hard time moving past this. She hinted about not going, you told her there was ample time to cancel and she didn't. Then the day of she announces she can't because of her parents and her reasoning is so ridiculous that it's laughable. Now because of her immaturity, you're out a lot of money. Not sure I'd be able to look at her the same way and continue the relationship. She just proved how unreliable and that you can't trust her word at all.", "NTA. I think you're probably going to have trouble collecting the money and continuing the relationship, though.", "NTA. This was extremely unfair of her. You gave her the option to back out earlier, and she waited until the day of, and for such a stupid reason. I would be absolutely furious.\n\nAlso, your life as a couple belongs to you and her, not her parents. It sounds like she has some family issues she may want to work through with a therapist.", "NTA. Also, if she was reluctant to give you the info to go alone, did she even book it or has she taken the \u00a32,000 total or even just your \u00a31,000 and given it to her parents? Which is why she couldn\u2019t cancel earlier to give you a refund. She\u2019s already given the money to her parents. Losing that much money is an issue which she doesn\u2019t seem concerned about.", "NTA Are you sure she even booked it? Or if she did, are you sure she didn't cancel it and pass the money on to her parents?\n\nWith her being the lead passenger, as well as just this situation not making sense (opting to forfeit $2k because her parents don't have money)... it seems sketchy to me", "E S H you could have just went by yourself and that way your money wouldn't have gone to waste. She sucks for not canceling earlier/reassuring you that she'd definitely go.\n\nEdit: NTA OP wasn't able to go alone so I'm changing from everyone sucks here to not the asshole.", "NTA. Would\u2019ve just gone and enjoyed it without her it it was me but she ruined your trip. Is there any way to reschedule your flight and take someone else, a friend or family member instead?\n\nIf not, cancel what you can and tell her to pay you back the rest. Hotels sometimes give you a refund minus the first night or two so she should be taking what she gets back and cover whatever you don\u2019t since she was the once that cancelled the trip last minute. If it was an emergency or something serious, I\u2019d say just let it go but this? She should pay you back.", "I really don't get the logic here.  \n\"I can't take a \u00a3500 holiday because it would make my parents feel bad that I spent \u00a3500\"\n\nFollowed by  \n\"I'm going to just not go and cancel the whole thing, knowing that this will cost \u00a31000 and that will somehow make my parents feel better(?) because I sacrificed that money and didn't get to have a holiday. It's so much better for them to know that between us we had \u00a31000 and I decided to chuck it away rather than use it.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're NTA and your girlfriend is demented.", "This is - odd. I think she never booked the trip and had already given your money to her parents. She thought they'd pay her back in time to fix it so you'd never know, but started to have suspicions they wouldn't three weeks prior. So she tried to sow some seeds about needing to cancel - but was still hoping they'd pay her back and delayed until the last possible minute to cover up this had ever happened.\n\nShe simply stole from you and lied to you - and is trying to make you feel guilt about it.\n\nNTA", "NTA, especially because you couldn\u2019t go on your own or change travel plans even if you wanted to. But more than that, this reasoning on her part is so bizarre and flimsy at this point (since the money is irrevocably already *spent*) that it verges into fishy. \n\nIt really sounds like she had another reason for not going that she didn\u2019t want to disclose to you.", "NTA\n\nI N F O (doesn't affect my judgment, but I'm just curious!!): has she ever done anything like this before? It's seriously bizarre behavior/reasoning.", "NTA - but I was you I\u2019d probably had gone anyway, and never mention the money to her anymore.\n\nEdit: I see from other comments you couldn\u2019t go on your own as all the booking were on her name. Double AH from her side. You have all the right to pretend she gives your money back.", "NTA, you should have just gone without her since she cancelled at the last minute.  She owes you a full refund in my opinion.", "NTA she needs to pay you back but I would make her show you the cancelation. You may have already canceled and gave her parents the money.", "I think you could have gone without her if it was already paid for. \n\nBut no, you\u2019re not being greedy by asking to be reimbursed for her last minute cancellation. More so since you offered an out when you could\u2019ve gotten money back. NTA. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, her logic is insane. How is it rubbing someone\u2019s nose in their situation by doing something else? Her entire logic in your story describes a person I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to spend time with.", "Info: it seems your gf could have given you the QR code for you to travel alone but refused. Are you SURE she booked the trip at all and didn't just take the money to give her family?", "NTA then.  \n~~YTA since you could always choose to go alone (~~*~~not as fun but still doable~~*~~)~~\n\nAs for your girlfriend her reaction is very strange to me, i don't know how long you've been preparing this travel but backing out like that at the last minute is not right.\n\nHave you spoke to her parents because it's just not right to be that way :\n\n>she's anxious and feels bad for her parents\n\nRemember that she was suposed to tell them :\n\n>she just needs to get it over with and tell them", "INFO - what ELSE is going on between her and her parents? None of this adds up. \n\nBut if everything is as you say, NTA. I would inquire deeper though", "You're not likely to recoup any money, but you definitely need to lose the woman. Her flip-flopping and sudden cancellation won't get better in the future. She needs therapy.", "NTA\u2026but you should have went yourself.  And I think this has nothing to do with her parents.  This is all on your girlfriend.  You are not greedy and deserve her portion of the cancelled trip.", "Esh: you should have rescheduled the reservation out another few months, then cancel that reservation. You fucked up. That's not her fault.\n\nThere's certainly issues with communication and priorities.", "NTA.  \n\nYou can have sympathy for her anxiety, while still being unwilling to pay for it.  \n\nThe fact is that she's responsible for her words and actions.  You asked her while you could still cancel if she still wanted to go.  She said yes.  You chose to continue the reservation because of that.  \nThen at the airport, she said no.  You then lost \u00a31000 because of her decision to not go.  \n\nPut bluntly- you put up \u00a31000 and then lost it all because of her actions.  And that makes her responsible for it.  \n\n**THAT SAID--**  \n\nI'd suggest at least pay some attention to her emotional state.  Remember she's a person too, and she's obviously got some kind of emotional or anxiety issue related to her parents which would make her cancel the trip last minute.  She is probably feeling guilty for this also- beating herself up for not going, beating herself up for losing the money, mad at herself for chickening out, terrified (that made her chicken out in the first place), anxious that you'll dump her over this, etc.  And you focus on the money, so she reacts with the instinct of someone who's overwhelmed and in fight or flight mode mentally, and lashes out because she needs emotional support.  \n\nI'm not saying you should ignore the money issue.  Only that if you care about her, focus on her as a person first, and the money second.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How can you ever trust what she says now? And she is a baby for not being able to be honest with her parents. So you will never be able to travel because it MIGHT hurt their feelings? Sweet Jesus", "NTA, should have gone anyway. She caused you both to lose that money because she is too much of a child to process her own emotions.", "NTA, she owes you big time!

I think she should pay since it was a unilateral decision.", "NTA\u2026 mostly. She couldn\u2019t make up her mind and you both paid the price.

She threw out money because her parents are struggling financially???", "Also if she was worried about a vacation being disrespectful, how is totally wasting the money any better??", "I agree that something is fishy here. There should have been some effort on her part to do something about this in the days leading to the trip. Sounds to me like OP has been scammed.", "This!!!

Probably won't help the hotel issue though.", "That... doesn't sound right? Even if the pass was booked through her account, you could have gone to the airport counter for them to look you up and print you a paper ticket. That's literally their job.", "INFO: Did you ever see the receipts and itinerary from the booking agent for this trip?", "So with her refusing to go you had no way to go yourself... okay.\n\nI would take it very bad myself.", "Did you ask her to make those changes so you could still go?", "That's my question, why couldn't she have given it to him/checked him in? I haven't flown a lot though so I'm not sure how this works lol", "It sounds like she did refuse, and didn't give him the confirmation code, either. But in addition, even if he could get there, a lot of hotels will check your ID before giving you your room keys, so if that was all in her name, it might have still been a wash.", "You can't make any changes within 48 hours of the flight so we couldn't", "If she did refuse to give him the QR code and to check in then he could go to court and say she intentionally prevented him from being able to check-in and board.

She absolutely should pay you back. \n\nIt would be one thing if she had a panic attack because of travel or plane flight that was sudden and unexpected but this reason is ridiculous and was premeditated.\n\nYou\u2019re right - it\u2019s not like she was going to hand her poor parents the 1k you were spending so what was her point?\n\nSo nta, get that money back - and if you can\u2019t, consider whether this is the future you want.", "You could've asked her for your ticket. The idea that you couldn't have sounds preposterous to everyone.\n\nLike I wouldn't go. Who wants to go alone. But the idea that you couldn't is absurd.", "Just a tip for the future, usually you can go to the airport and have them find your reservation with just your id and they can print ur boarding pass for you. You might have issue with the hotel but she could have probably called them before your arrival and worked it out w/ front desk or something.", "Do you think maybe she\u2019d already canceled the trip earlier and pocketed the money?", "You have no information about this booking \u2014 like a confirmation e-mail. How do you know this 48-hour policy?"]}
