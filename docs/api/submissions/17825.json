There was a rare period of hot weather (we're from the UK) so we decided to turn it into me visiting for a week since we did long distance. \n\nI asked and my ex had assured me that we were not going straight to the lake once I arrived so I packed a suitcase instead of one of those hiking backpacks since it was going to be so hot and I didn't want to get the backpack all sweaty on my back and it would be easy to wheel a suitcase through town to her place. \n\nImmediately once I got there, she said we were walking (a 2 hour walk across cobbled pavements and non-tarmac streets) straight to the beach and they'd all brought beers and stuff to drink. I was taken aback since she'd told me we weren't (they'd changed their minds and forgot to tell me) and in the end I had to haul the suitcase on a 4.5 round trip to the lake and and back to her flat. The wheels were done in as they tried to wheel it for me since I was getting tired and the suitcase was basically unusable. My ex promised she would replace the wheels (I looked into it and replacement wheels cost \u00a375 which was way too expensive for me). \n\nShe never replaced them and me assuming we'd be together for life just put it to the back of my mind. We broke up a few months later because she cheated and tried to hide it until one of her friends admitted he knew that she cheated and the guilt caught up to her. Now I'm moving and need that suitcase so WIBTA to message and ask her to send me the cash to replace the wheels? I don't know if she would (we broke up a year ago) but I would like to at least try get the cash back\n\nEDIT: I'm not gonna do it lmao. She's gonna stay blocked.

Consider it the cost of getting a cheater out of your life.", "NTA, but I personally wouldn't.  I feel like the statute of limitations is up on this scenario and you've both hopefully moved on with life.  Just consider this another shitty thing she did and replace the bag.\n\nIf you do end up asking though, my the odds ever be in your favor.  Wouldn't hold your breath though.", "YTA \n\nYou broke up a year ago and this incident happened even longer before that. It obviously wasn\u2019t worth it enough to pursue when  it happened (I assume cause you stayed with her months after) and it\u2019s not worth it more then a year after. Move on dude.", "Don't do it. You're gonna come off as petty and pathetic. Like anyone non the outside will assume you just wanted a reason to contact the ex, and they WILL use it as a chance to talk shit.\n\nIt'd be different if they owed youv$100s/1000s.", "In my humble opinion ESH, she for obvious reasons and she should replace the wheels because she said she would and it\u2019s a lot of money. \n\nHowever I\u2019m a bit unsure about her degree of responsability: you made a first bad choice by taking the suitcase, and a second by insisting to walk the distance instead of taking public transportation or an Uber. \n\u201eShe had assured me that we were not going straight to the lake once I arrived\u201c - \u201eImmediately once I got there, she said we were walking\u201c: how did you wanted to organise? Arriving at her place and repacking? Couldn\u2018t you have done this in 5 mins before leaving with her? What I\u2018m trying to say is that sure, the plans changed, but you could have expressed your concerns and insisted on taking a moment to repack, for exemple. Nobody else is responsible for your stuff.", "Yeah it's definitely not a serious thing. If she said no I wouldn't be like well you have to", "You're so right. I never thought of it like that", "Yeah, it was my bad, I just assumed she would eventually and I only just remembered now pulling the suitcase out from under my bed. I don't really think she'll pay but it would be nice", "Yeah, the case was wrecked. Basically a glorified handbag", "Yeah understandable it was a mess lol. So we travelled to each other by a 2 hour train. I was meant to be staying at her flat and she'd explained to me in messages that she would meet me at the station with her car in which we go to her flat where I drop my luggage off and then we go shopping for drinks and meet everyone and walk to the lake. However, she and her friends did a switcheroo without telling me the night before and immediately we had to walk to the lake. Why we couldn't walk to her flat first because it was obvious my case wasn't going to survive the walk is a question I will never know the answer to because I did ask and she said there was no point walking to hers with the case and then to the lake because it's more distance and they'd already been shopping without me. So we walked", "Tbf my chances are probably really low but \u00a375 is a lot of money and I need that case to move to my new flat. Even if she sees it as petty, at the end of the day she cheated on me and then hid it from me which is way worse than me being petty I think", "Honestly me neither lmao I definitely blocked her after we broke up but hopefully she never noticed", "Yeah I only took a suitcase because she had made me think and told me the night before that she would be at the station in her car to pick me up to bring the case to her place and then we walk from her flat to get drinks and to meet up with her friends. I would have repacked at her flat and brought a smaller backpack which I brought with me yes. \n\nPlan changed and she arrived to meet me car-less and with our friends and they'd all gone shopping before hand without telling me. She lives in a city without UBER so it wouldn't have been possible to get one anyway and no buses go towards the lake so walking was our only option and also that's what everyone (including me but with a smaller backpack) wanted to do anyway since it was hot. \n\nNo one wanted to walk to my girlfriends flat and then double back and walk further to the lake so the case got carried and ruined. If things had turned like my girlfriend assured me they would over text the night before, the case would be intact", "I think the issue is asking at all is going to damage your rep the same amount as trying to force her at this point. If you no longer have any mutual in common, no worries, but otherwise I wouldn\u2019t.", "Weird as hell on her part. She\u2019s an asshole for not paying you but yeah, might be best to take the L at this point for the sake of moving on.", "You're absolutely right.\nI don't think you're an asshole at all, rather she is. But issues around money are hard especially when there's a break up and cheating.\n\nBut she said she'd pay for it didn't and yeah she also cheated on you.\n\nHopefully she'll suck it up and just pay what she owes but depends on how bitter she is"]}
