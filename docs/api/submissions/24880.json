The plushie was over 10 years old. Yesterday I got home from work, and was exhausted so I went to bed, I usually have the plushie in bed with me so I freaked out when it wasn't there. I  asked him where it was and he calmly said, \"I got rid of it, I'll buy you a better looking one.\" I was crying at this point, and I just yelled at him to get the fuck out of my house.

Bravo, OP you made the right choice, stick to your guns and enjoy that plushie!", "What an asshole! It\u2019s sentimental and the fact that he just threw it out is wrong and also him not comforting you after your friend passed is absurd! Congratulations to you for dumping his ass!", "NTA \n\nI do think that throwing him out for a plushie sounds extreme. But think of it another way. He\u2019s decided that his discomfort (or annoyance)  is more important then your emotions. More then that it was a breach of trust. Him throwing away the memento of your friend was a very intentional action and he knew it would hurt.
