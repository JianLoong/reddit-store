He\u2019s decided that his discomfort (or annoyance)  is more important then your emotions. More then that it was a breach of trust.

Toss out the ex. He does not have the right to make that decision. What would he think if you threw out something that belonged to him? He and his friends would be complaining about it.", "NTA. It's not about the plushie, it's about his ongoing jealousy of a dead person and his complete lack of empathy because he didn't like them. That lack of empathy will definitely translate into other areas of your life. He will not be a partner or a reliable emotional support for any issue he is not personally invested in.", "NTA - Your ex was attempting to erase a memory by disposing of the last tangible connection to your bestie.  It's up to YOU to decide if and when you're ready to do that.  Not him.  It's more than a plushie.  Besides - sentimental attachment aside it's not HIS decision when you should get rid of YOU belongings.  Anyone calling you dumb over it is not a friend and you should yeet them to the curb as well.  There are better people out there.", "NTA. That was purposefully cruel. As you, and anyone with half a brain, knows, this has nothing to do with a plushie. Your (hopefully now ex) boyfriend was being manipulative, controlling, and cruel. He has no respect for you and neither does anyone who is calling you immature. Get rid of all of them. \n\nI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t actually destroy it and you have it now.", "NTA I have a plushie collection they are all sentimental in one way or another I keep them in an antique chest and some have been passed to my daughter my husband buys me build a bears to add to it on various occasions.", "NTA... This isn't about a plushie, this is about: his blatant entitlement, controlling you and your belongings, complete lack of empathy towards a human being who died-- a human being who was your best friend, and blatant disregard for your feelings in lieu of \"something that looks better. \n\nNot only is he *shallow AF* he's just as petty. I would have done the same thing tossing him on his pot like that.", "NTA I'm so glad you got your plushie back. I hope you never take the boyfriend back.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about the plushie it's about him trying to control you and remove stuff from your life.\n\nI have a bear my sister gave me. He got mauled by a Doberman I was dog-sitting for, and I sent him away to be refurbished (pun intended). It was close to $100 but IMO, worth it.\n\nBear isn't just a bear someone bought at a shop in the mid-80s for my then-baby sister. He reminds me of all the good times my sister and I had playing together with him. When she gave him to me before going to college she was like, \"Now you'll always have a hug from me.\" The idea being that all her hugs were stored up in him and he could pass them on.\n\nWhen our dad was dying, he seemed to be holding on. We were talking to him and he'd show signs of recognition but it was like he wasn't ready to go. I told my sister, do the Bear voice for him. If he hears the Bear he'll know his little girls are okay and that he can go.\n\nShe did. I wasn't in the room, but she said his eyebrows shot up and then he seemed to relax and just go.\n\nPlushies aren't just plushies in many cases; they're reminders of childhood; of friends; of family. Before he was fixed, people who know me well would joke about the Bear/call him a \"threadbear.\" But it wasn't ever about him being cute.", "NTA.

He had absolutely no right to do what he did, and frankly doing it was not only selfish but really actively cruel. Yes, the object in the situation was a plushy, but I guarantee you this type of disregard and abuse will happen to you again and again if you stay with this person.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t about the plushie itself, it\u2019s that it\u2019s a memento from your dead best friend.

I mean it's just a game right ;-)", "NTA I'm so glad you got the stuffie back. Get you a man who honors what's important to you.", "Absolutely NTA - It's not even just about your totally valid attachment to the plushie, the fact of the matter is that it's your property and it's not his place to get rid of it.", "NTA.\n\nI still have the blankie my grandmother made me when i was born, 6 I am 40. It's the last thing she ever knitted, and the only reason it isn't currently in my bed is because it needs a small patch job. It's old and no longer the nicest thing in the world, but it is the one thing I have had that has been mine since infancy. It has seen me through everything: the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly; absolutely everything.\n\nHubsnerd gave his childhood bear to our daughter since her elder half-brother didn't want it. When he said it would be time to give the blankie to her soon, I told him she can have it when I am dead. He's never said a word about it since, and there's been absolutely no judgment.\n\nMy best friend still has her baby blanket. My other friend still has her baby plushie, much like the plushie your friend left you. Both are in their 30s, and they both feel the same way I do. They are the main things from our childhood that the sentimentality is too strong to let go of voluntarily. We all intend to leave them to our children when we die, if they want them for the sentimentality, but if they do not, they are to be buried with us.\n\nThe fact that your friend left you her plushie speaks very highly of how she thought of you. She had to know that you would appreciate the reasoning behind the gift, and she had to trust you implicitly. I am sorry you lost your friend. When she left, she gave you one of the biggest gifts you could have ever been given. At least, that is my opinion.\n\nI am glad he did not destroy it, and I'm glad you got it back. It is also pleasing to know that you got rid of him, as he has just proven that you can never trust him. NTA 111%.", "NTA I didn't hear a single good thing about him in the post. Good for you taking out the trash and don't take it back.", "The ex boyfriend is an uncaring jerk.  EVERYONE grieves differently.   I'm glad you got the plushie back.  Ignore those who are trying to shame you.  Dumping h was the right thing.  It's not about the plushie, it's about his lack of empathy.", "I'm so glad you have it back. The only thing that belongs in the bin is your BF, who maliciously set out to hurt you and was jealous of your best friend's memory. Don't let him back into your life: you can do better.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you lost your friend.  Keep that asshole ex gone. Also, given what a toxic and selfish guy he is: change your locks and your online/banking/streaming passwords and have all current users reset/wiped where applicable. \n\nIf you mixed finances at all so that he had access, change your credit card/debit card numbers and ATM pins, and freeze your credit. The kind of shady, awful person that would do and say what he did cannot be trusted with any sort of human decency.", "It\u2019s far from just a plushie as the sentimental value was priceless \n\nKick him to the curb and let him stay there\n\nAnyone saying \u2018it was just a plushie\u2019 simply don\u2019t understand and you don\u2019t need that negativity in your life", "Yep.
