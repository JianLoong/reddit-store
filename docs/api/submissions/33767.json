It\u2019s like they completely change personalities.  The only recourse is to find new, child-free friends.

It sounds like you've known (either consciously or unconsciously) that she's a taker and the world revolves around her. You've always been the sidekick to Rachel and she doesn't seem like she even cares for you or this friendship besides how it serves her. \n\nThe fact she can't put her stuff aside while you're sharing your struggles tells me she doesn't give af and is selfish and you're starting to see it. I'm sure if you reflect back, you'll notice you put in a lot more into this friendship (by a mile) than she does. So the question is what exactly has sustained this friendship and why is it important to you? Is it the history aka longevity?", "ESH. You are allowed to have feelings/needs and share them, but it sounds like you need a therapist. It sounds like Rachel missed the point and wasn't a supportive friend. Maybe send Rachel a message saying you really need her support right now and ask for help to find a counselor.", "Nah.  What I would say being further along in life is not every friendship survives every season.  I would also ask given your description, as an adult has she ever really been emotionally supportive?   Regardless of how your friendship goes forward, you both could benefit from friends and acquaintances to connect with in your own position in life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
