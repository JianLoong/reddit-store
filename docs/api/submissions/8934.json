I mean not the act itself but what he is prepared to do should tell you a lot about this guy. On a day when it should be about you two he wants to spend it away from you, then when you told him how you feel he then said he couldn\u2019t talk to you\u2026..\n\nAre you really sure you want to marry this guy? The fact that he couldn\u2019t even resolve an argument is rather concerning.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "Nta. This is some weird power play by his sister.

Are you marrying because you love each other and the relationship is good, or because you want to hit the achievement button on being married? Marriage isn't a fix it button, and I guarantee you this isn't him being obtuse. This is him showing you that marriage isn't a priority for him right now, and you should listen.", "NTA.

It\u2019s a low-key wedding but should still be a lovely day for you both. He shouldn\u2019t be driving hours away to repair his sister\u2019s car. That weekend should be about you both only. The rest of the world can wait 48 hours!\nSaying you can\u2019t talk is BS!

Sis, you've got time to back out of this mistake - it's not too late. He's telling you where you and your relationship stand on his priorities list - LISTEN TO HIM. You are less of a priority on your wedding day than him tinkering with his sister's car, a task that he could do literally any other day.", "NTA. But with the age gap, the pull of his sister (why isn't she invited to the wedding?), and the comment about not being able to say anything, there's something that doesn't quite sit right here.", "NTA. That was a pretty careless move on his part. Also not sure why he even bothered to ask if he wasn\u2019t going to listen when you said you were upset.\n\nI do think the fact that you guys promised to do the ceremony how you wanted later might have made him think this was an ordinary day like any other. I would communicate to him expectations - \u2018we will do the ceremony how we want later but I still would like you to be present the day of, meaning you spend at least half the day with me in a meaningful way\u2019", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he can't even prioritise you on your wedding day I probably wouldn't get married, because you now know what your married life will be like with him.", "NTA. \n\nSo whose pushing for the marriage to happen now even though it's not how you wanted? Sounds like you should take the time and really think about the marriage. Maybe even wait till you can do it the way you guys originally wanted. \n\nTrust me, you need to figure this out before signing anything. It's so much harder to split up once legal paperwork comes into play.", "Have you talked with him asking why on his wedding day he needs to go work on her car ? \n\nReserving judgment until knowing his answer", "NTA.\n\nI wonder if the sister timed this deliberately to cause trouble between you and your bf. Surely he would have mentioned to her what he was doing on this day.", "NTA.\n\nThat puts a stormcloud over this day that should be special. Are you sure you want to go through with it right now, seeing how he has treated it? Will you be able to rescue the feeling of specialness and be able to feel that he is honoring you and focused on his thrill of devoting his life to you?\n\nWhen men pull things like that, it's sometimes a sign that they're resisting commitment or not overly thrilled about their match but don't have the backbone to articulate it to you. Those little gestures of disrespect add up.", "NTA. Holy cow, what was going through his mind. At least you know now where his insane priorities lie and unfortunately you aren't high on that list. Honestly, if someone treated me like this they would never have me as their bride.

From the outside is grim. I get it when its an emergency, but he actually PLANNED to do something unimportant for someone else when it should be about u two. \n\nA damn car is more important than your wedding day. U will be last choice always, u either accept it or re-evaluate. His priorities are screwed up, but thats a him problem. Yr priority should be yr happiness and peace of mind, nourish yourself and dont get buried in his indifference.", "NTA who tf asks someone to fix their car on their wedding day and who tf says yes", ">I told him I was upset that he even asked\n\nThat's not a healthy way to interact with a fianc\u00e9 or spouse. A simple \"no, it's not okay\" would have been far better.\n\nHe's not always going to think the way you do. He's not ever going to be able to read your mind. The sooner you learn to communicate clearly without blowing up, the better off you'll be. At the moment, you're training him to avoid talking to you.\n\nYTA.", "Yeah, it hurt to the core. Especially considering she has money and she isn't super close so it would be a big time suck.", "I thought so too, I'm not sure how to navigate this to be honest. It sent a ton of red flags and then sent me spiraling into self doubt.", "I could guarantee it isn't a surprise as much as I'd love for it to be.", "I've never been into dating younger, but he's always been more \"mature\" than the men I've dated that were older (sad, i know). However, more willing to talk and greater emotional maturity. This has my head spinning, though, as I thought we'd made some major changes and improved things in our relationship.", "I do worry you're right. I think others have made some good points about postponing and reevaluating things.", "I'm not sure. You could be right. He proposed without me pressuring him in any way as I never understood that. Maybe he was hitting the button he wasn't ready for. Maybe he was just proposing because he sees loads of his friends doing it.", "That's a good point -- I did say I would still like to make the best of it and we had discussed plans, but maybe that wasn't sufficiently clear.", "It's their wedding day!!!! And the sister lives 1.5 hours away.\nThe fact that he didn't laugh in his sister's face when she asked and then got annoyed that his bride was upset... wow.", "It's their wedding day...some things are highly obvious", "He is however expected to think like a competent adult. Thinking he could take 3+ travel time plus time to fix a car on their wedding day falls well below that standard.", "Doesn't sound like you're planning on breaking up the relationship so good luck with that.", "I would pause the wedding to be honest and see if he is willing to talk to you. Him wanting to help his sister is fine but not on your wedding day. If he doesn\u2019t get that then I think you both wanted different things. \n\nNo one is in the wrong but it would definitely make me question if you both want the same things in life.", "Seriously postpone the wedding.  And reassess.  Also don\u2019t let him catfish you on this.  This issue is all on him.", "NTA Please listen to your gut. I\u2019m not saying break up, but bare minimum you should probably put the wedding on hold. It doesn\u2019t sound like a case of cold feet, but his actions and non-chalant attitude regarding your wedding day isn\u2019t giving \u201cloving husband\u201d to me.\n\nIt seems like y\u2019all could use a little extra time to work on the foundation of your marriage. You have stuff you need to work on as a couple (communication and feeling like your wants will not be prioritized by him) in counseling. It\u2019s worth taking the time to do this. If you love each other and are truly right together, what is the harm in waiting to get married?  Listening to that little voice inside your head could make a major difference down the road. The last thing you want is to go through with something, regret it, and then wind up paying for a divorce. \n\n\nKeep your plans with your friends, you can deal with getting married later. Good luck", "All of you people are so quick to \"ruin\" peoples relationships.  \"Don't marry the guy\", \"He is oblivious\", etc.\n\nWhen I read this I see a guy that is a people pleaser and can't say no to people.  That can obviously be a problem, but it is not a fatal flaw.\n\nMaybe you left out details that would allow more clarity.  Does he have a weird relationship with his sister?  Did you already feel like he doesn't take your feelings into account?\n\nIf not, something as easy as \"Honey, this is OUR day and I would love to spend it together.\"  Maybe his sister stated that she didn't know how she would make it to the wedding and he is coming up with a way to fix the problem?\n\nAgain, IMO, not enough info.", "If you marry him you\u2019ll feel unimportant for the rest of your life or at least for as long as it takes for you to do what you should be doing now which is to leave.\nThis is a genuinely ridiculous thing to even consider let alone you ask about.", "Or he knew you wanted to, so he wanted to make you happy. Then realized it all moved faster than he expected. Maybe he was anticipating waiting until you could afford the big wedding, not a quick ceremony and party later on.", "I think some valid points for postponing things have been made. I'm not sure about going so far as to end things as he generally shows more emotional maturity. He's also shown a willingness to put in the work and stick to it. \n\nI think maybe taking a step back and assessing if this was a bad misunderstanding -- someone else pointed out that we do intend to do things later on and this was less than our desired outcome.\n\nWe did discuss making the best of it, and we did make plans. I'm just wondering if maybe he somehow misinterpreted the day and therefore didn't think it would be a big deal.\n\nI still think he should have told her Sunday would be a better option and I don't think I should have to tell him that. I'm just thinking more of a deep dive and taking a little more time and postponing the marriage.  Maybe I'm being daft. Idk, this really knocked the wind out of my sails and surprised me. Sorry, probably venting more than you care to read.", "I think it's the whole after voicing her upset his reply was I can't even talk to you. That doesn't sound very people pleaser", ">misinterpreted the day\n\nWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\n\n Stop making excuses for him.", "This comment is so disappointing.\n\nYou KNOW he didn\u2019t \u201cmisinterpret the day\u201d whatever that means.\nYou KNOW what he\u2019s asking is unreasonable, disrespectful and a huge red flag.\nYou KNOW this will carry on if you marry him (\u2018will he make excuses when I\u2019m giving birth?\u2019 Answer, probably).\n\nHe didn\u2019t even apologise and instead pulled a majorly manipulative move of putting it on you. \n\nTo be completely frank, if you marry him after this you\u2019d be an idiot.", "> I'm just wondering if maybe he somehow misinterpreted the day \n\nIt's not like he got confused over standard weekend plans, you're getting married.\n\nStop giving the lad outs", "> *this was less than our desired outcome. We did discuss making the best of it*\n\nYou said the several times. Why do you have to get married now if it's not when/how/why you wanted to do it? Getting married shouldn't be something you \"make the best of\"--it's hard enough already without bringing such a little expectations into it. Your wedding day should be joyful, not something you're settling for."]}
