It isn't how we imagined but we promise to do it how we wanted later.\n\nHe asks me if it's ok if he does work on his sister's car the day we're getting married. We ALREADY planned getting a drink with friends and then going out to eat or making dinner together at home. We don't have money for anything crazy, but I assumed we'd spend the day together. \n\nI should mention she lives 1.5 hours away, so it would be a good chunk of the day.\n\nI told him I was upset that he even asked, because really he should have just told her he would on Sunday.\n\nOne, she makes hella money and could pay someone. Two, it makes me feel incredibly unimportant. Three, I now worry that he doesn't view big events as important. Is he going to try and make plans when I give birth?\n\nHe didn't apologize, but countered with how he can't even talk to me.\n\nAita?\n\nUPDATE: \n******\nI genuinely appreciate the overwhelming support. I'm planning on having a conversation with him after he's off work today. I've seen some valid points that maybe our wedding day has been under valued since we have additional plans we intend to move forward with when we can. Maybe he didn't realize the importance of it (we are both on the spectrum), but that still doesn't justify/excuse his reaction.\n\nI think we will likely postpone for a bit. Not sure how long.\n\nTo his credit, he has greater emotional maturity than any man I've known/previously dated so this caught me with my pants down tbh. He's also the most willing partner to admit fault and make permanent changes. \n\nI don't intend to just end things as I believe he has shown he is a great partner -- he has just acted super scummy at one of the worst possible times.\n\nI'll update how the conversation goes. How he reacts could certainly change how I feel right now. I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt as it hasn't been his norm.\n******", "created_utc": 1675317881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rijks/aita_for_being_upset_my_fiance_asked_to_do/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
