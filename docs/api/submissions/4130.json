I\u2019m very happy to inform everyone that this is a happy update and things thankfully didn\u2019t escalate. \n\nI reached out to Andrew and talked with him privately about what I had heard and he was also as taken back as I was, given that Jess had not mentioned anything to him either. I asked for him to not mention it to Jess and instead chose to talk to her myself. We had lunch at my apartment and she did confide in me about some insecurities she had felt about my friendship with her fianc\u00e9. I was more than happy to reassure her that he was nothing more to me than a little brother. We also established more boundaries so she feels more secure. \n\nWe also talked about what our mutual friend said and Jess did talk to her about how she was feeling but she never asked or even mentioned my participation in the wedding. I did offer to back out of the wedding party but she insisted that it wasn\u2019t necessary and both her and Andrew wanted me there. \n\nI did take some people\u2019s advice and me and Jess will have a girls night every Friday. It\u2019s important to me to be able to be even closer with her and I want to be able to put any of her worries to rest. \n\nAs for some criticism in my last post about me saying me and Andrew were each other\u2019s \u2018number one\u2019, I can assure you all that I meant it in \u201cwe\u2019ll have other friends but we\u2019ll always be each other\u2019s number one friend\u201d. I know my place in Andrew\u2019s life and I am in no way trying to be or will I ever be above his future wife.", "created_utc": 1670364675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zejqp4/update_wibta_if_i_attended_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 687, "replies": ["Ahhh. Finally I get to read about mature behavior. This is how one is supposed to act.  If there\u2019s a problem, address it with the person. Talk it out in a non-confrontational manner.

Thanks for the update!", "Lovely, clear, mature communication. A reddit rarity indeed.", "This is the best update!  Thank you for sharing.", "Great update. Glad things worked out.", "I can definitely see this doing well on r/BestofRedditorUpdates soon, when it inevitably gets posted there. I love happy endings/beginnings. OP, I am so happy for you that you and your best friend worked things out with his fianc\u00e9e so you can now have another good friend. :) This is the best possible outcome.", "You are one smart human!!!", "This is such a great update! It\u2019s so wonderful that everyone was able to talk it out & resolve things. All the best to you all! \ud83d\udc9c", "Amazing job OP!! Beautifully done!!!", "Great update! \ud83e\udd17 Thanks for sharing Op! Glad you had a chat with both them and have a great plan going forward! Have fun at the wedding!", "This is a truly delightful post", "Yeah, it sounds like the mutual friend was overstepping a good bit, though they likely had good intentions. But overall great update", "Great update! My husband also had a female best friend when we met. I decided I could be jealous or I could be friends with her as well.\n\nI've been married for over two decades and she's still my best friend! Her and I talk and hang out together MUCH more than they do these days! I'm an aunt to her kids and she's an aunt to mine. Our families have even vacationed together some years.\n\nMature adults can make this work.", "THIS! OP, you handled this so maturely. Your BFF was mature about it. And so was his wife. I'm so happy for all of you! Their future kids are going to be so lucky to have you as an auntie (my culture lol) in their lives...thanks for a lovely update :)", "Mvp", "I'm sorry ma'am, this is reddit. This kind of logic is not allowed. \n\nJk, glad it went well.", "You handled it perfectly and it all worked out fine. Yay!\n\nYou are awesome!", "Id definitely keep an eye on that 3rd party friend that informed you of this in the first place. they seem like the type that loves to stir drama from afar", "Oh come on.  The readers are here for the car crashes.", "Thank you for your public service!", "The hero we need.", "One of my longest friends is a guy and we met when we were 14. We're now in our 40s and his wife is the best! After 20 years as their friend I kinda like her better \ud83d\ude03. She is one of my closest friends now. Are you her?! Lol.", "This, this right here, is exactly how to handle these situations. You were supportive and understanding, she was insecure (normal) but honest and unjudgmental. \n\nYou all handled this beautifully.\n\n>I know my place in Andrew\u2019s life and I am in no way trying to be or will I ever be above his future wife.\n\nWell said and very mature of you", "thank you for this update! and i\u2019m so glad you all were able to talk it out like mature adults."]}
