I promise these comments would be vastly different if it was an overweight person complaining about being rejected, bullied, and made fun of for their weight due to a medical issue. Nobody would try single out \u201ctheir attitude\u201d for the reason they struggle with with dating. \n\nI think certain people need to keep quiet if they don\u2019t have any idea about these kinds of issues, and to stop pretending that they know best on issues they will never understand..", "NTA  \nIt's YOUR body and therefore it's Your choice whether or not you want to take the shot, They dont actually care about your feeling or your well being they just care that you will be tall so that they can \"flaunt\" that you are tall to other people.

I\u2019ve discussed it with his pedi and they assure me his growth trajectory is normal and he just hasn\u2019t hit his \u201cgrowth spurt\u201d.  I obsess over it because of what you\u2019re feeling and experiencing - that because you\u2019re very short you therefore don\u2019t have a girlfriend and feel terrible about being short.  It could very well be the case that you just haven\u2019t met the right girl or it could be because girls are size queens and even the 5-footers oddly prefer tall guys.  That\u2019s an issue on the part of many women that in order to feel feminine, they need to feel tiny in comparison to their male partner.  Dumb really.  \n\nAs far as whether you\u2019re the a-hole - definitely NTA for getting pissed at their jokes (how hurtful, I would NEVER do that to my son) but not sure if YTA if you\u2019re pissed at them opting out of the treatment.  You may not have been privy to all of the potential side effects at the time and I\u2019m going to give the benefit of the doubt that they thought they were protecting your overall health not just saving money.  It\u2019s rarely so cut and dry that \u201cboom, take this shot and he\u2019ll reach average height\u201d.  Hormones and growth treatment are complex with so many scary side effects.\n\nThe advice I intend to give my son is that there is a lid for every pot and a girlfriend or wife is absolutely not the key to happiness.  I\u2019m not saying relationships aren\u2019t important but don\u2019t focus your energy on just that.  It\u2019s critical to be happy on your own so you can be happy with someone else.  The reason relationships fail so often is because people are looking for someone else to make them whole and another person simply cannot do that.\n\nBest of luck and don\u2019t let the bastards get you down.", "NTA - Your parents denied you critical healthcare that they could afford to cover. \n\nYou had a very real and very serious hormonal deficiency that was treatable and they played it off like it was nothing. \n\nI'd have been pissed off too", "Nta your parents suck but you should also consider some therapy to learn how to cope because you\u2019re going to be this height for the rest of your life and you need to accept it.\n\nFwiw my parents refused to get me braces, which they could afford and I was salty for years.

They keep joking about it, so hearing the truth probably won't hurt them.   \n\n\nBut for what its worth, your height should be irrelevant.

Horrible parents and they 100% deserve to have it thrown back in their face at every opportunity.\n\nBUT! You're not off the hook. It's mainly because of your mindset, which is of course rooted in the horrible role models you were raised by, but that's beside the point.\n\nBeing short will limit your dating selection. I'm not going to lie about that. But attracting people is more about how you carry yourself and your confidence. You're a short guy and that's not going to change. Own it. When you own it, it becomes less effective of a putdown against you. When you start being comfortable with what you are, you will attract the women that can look past it and see you for who you are.\n\nAnd to be honest, that can be a good thing. You have a built in filter for a lot of shallow women that pull the \"under 6' need not apply\" crap. Women like that tend to be very superficial which isn't a great baseline for a relationship.", "NTA.  \n\nI was prepared to get on your case based on the title.

Be kind. Be funny. Learn to deal with your anger. Do well in college. Get out into the world and enjoy hobbies. Enjoy life.

Your family sounds like a bunch of bullies and are calling you an AH because you calling them out on it makes it so they have to reflect on their behaviors. Don't fall for the tears or the name calling. You're allowed to have boundaries. Jokes are supposed to be funny for everyone involved, including you.

Being short doesn't mean you won't meet someone worth while. And it isn't the end all/be all for relationships. If you let your insecurity consume you, it can manifest in ways that might overshadow who you are as a person.

Just just put in the work now so that eventually the people who like short men or just don't care about height (We exist) are in a position to date?.\n\nOne thing I recommend is looking up attractive male celebrities who are around your height.

Make a joke about it in your bio, the more you can show comfort with your situation and demonstrate that your masculinity isn't so fragile, the better luck you'll have. Maybe something about being able to wear your heels.", "You're not unfuckable, you're just short.", "As a woman myself, your height is a great litmus test for dating, honestly. If anyone cares about something that\u2019s absolutely out of your control, they\u2019re not worth any of your time. \n\nThat being said, your family are AHs because of their joking about it. It\u2019s immature and it gets old fast. \n\nDid they know before how their jokes make you feel?", "You should just be upfront about it and then you won't have those interactions becaue they'll be filtered out. If you cast a very large net, you'll undoubtedly have interactions of rejection. I've met plenty of women that dated men shorter than them or had no qualms about it.", "I hear that, but I know plenty of short men that have great success. You just have to find a way to own it, and I mostly see that be pretty successful through comedy and being genuine. Self loathing is not attractive on anyone. \n\nSure, there are plenty of women that will discount you immediately because of your height. That's ok, they're not for you. There will be others that don't, especially as you get older. I'm 5'1 and the best lover I've ever had is 5'3\". He's also sweet, hilarious, kind, intelligent, and a wonderful conversationalist. Lean into your positive personality traits, they'll far outweigh the physical attributes in the long run.", "My husband's entire family is uncommonly tall - men and women. \"Shorties\" was 5'11\" and one aunt was about 5'7\". Two of his aunts, his mother, and his female cousin are all over 6'2\". The tallest of their husbands is 5'10\". The shortest was about 5'4\" on a good day.

My mother said she fell for him because he\u2019s a great guy and always followed through with making plans. Like if he said he would call, he did. They\u2019ve been married (very happily, I think) for 50 years.\n\nPart of why my dad was able to get my mom is that he\u2019s very confident. He\u2019s confident about his intelligence and his personality. If you\u2019re confident in who you are, you\u2019re going to attract people to you.\n\nAnd there are plenty of short women, like my 5\u20192 self, who prefer men who aren\u2019t tall.", "I see your point, I really do. And I\u2019m sorry because I would probably feel frustrated too when the choice was made for you.\n\nI also just don\u2019t see it as something that has to be \u201covercome\u201d. I\u2019m coming from a woman\u2019s perspective where there\u2019s pressure from the fricking moment you\u2019re born to be beautiful, to be thin but curvy and effortlessly feminine and wear a little makeup but not too much and and and. It\u2019s not just dating, even women\u2019s salaries are higher if they\u2019re thin and beautiful.\n\nI say this not to be preachy but just to let you know that we all face social pressure about our looks, some more than others. Your body isn\u2019t something that needs to change or something you need to overcome. It just *is*. Take it from the half of the population that is familiar with the constant judgement of our appearance and learn from what we\u2019ve learned as well. Fuck what anyone else says or thinks. Your body is amazing as it is. Do you have any idea how intricately wired the human body is? The brain is INCREDIBLE. The way our organs work, our ability to fight off diseases and heal injuries. It\u2019s frickin amazing.\n\nYour family sucks and I\u2019d say they deserved the comment. But man, stop letting people tear you down and stop tearing yourself down.", "honestly it doesn\u2019t matter if it is a dating issue or not. The bottom line is that your parents refused to support your clear preference in medical treatment, at an age when children should be able to do a lot of their own decision-making. They gambled on something that will affect you in the long run, and worse, they make fun of you for something that they caused. I\u2019m so sorry your parents did that and continue to act that way, it\u2019s fucked up.", "Sure, short guys do have it harder. But there are lots of us out there honestly. I was engaged to a man your height. I hope that sometime you can maybe look at it as you get to weed out someone shallow immediately rather than wasting time finding out later. \n\nI'm sorry your parents let you down, and didn't get you the treatment you wanted. You're nta for getting angry at their jokes. They're not appropriate.", "To offer you another perspective, I find short (especially short and slim guys) much, much hotter than tall men. Women like me are out there I promise! You don\u2019t have to overcome anything with us because we\u2019ll like you just the way you are.", "I know where you\u2019re coming from but you *have* to stop thinking like this. Is it not fair? Yes, but if you\u2019re constantly stewing thinking about how being short ruins your dating chances, you ruin your dating chances. \n\nYour mental state will be huge here and if approach every interaction actively thinking you\u2019re at a disadvantage you only damage your own motivation and confidence. The person you\u2019re looking for doesn\u2019t care about your height, so why worry about the pipeline who do? They aren\u2019t the one.", "Congrats on becoming a victim of the inherent privilege in society! If you fit into a category that society deems as worthy, you have to overcome new obstacles. Take this experience and empathize with others who are in similar boats. Focusing on how unfair it is that you're short is so off-putting, and I've literally had to cut people off because of how toxic the mindset can become. \"Short man syndrome\" truly exists and has very little to do with real height and a lot to do with how people view themselves and heal from it.", "Everyone has something they need to overcome in order to get a partner.  Whether it's personality, hygiene, height, weight, self-esteem...But trust me, women can tell when a guy is 'poor me...I'm so \\[fill in the blank\\]\".  It's frustrating and not attractive.  I know lots of shorts guys (shorter than you) than can get any girl they want because they have a fantastic personality and yeah, are decent looking.  \n\nI do think your NTA, your parents made the wrong choice in not giving you the shots and are def assholes for making jokes about your height.  It's nothing to joke about.", "I'm not the person you responded to, but anyway - because of the treatment you've endured feom your family. There is nothing wrong with being short, but clearly they've tried their best to convince you there is with their incessant teasing. \n\nI've been bullied my whole childhood, and it fucked me up in ways I never realized until I got older and further away from the bullying. My bullies weren't my family, they were just middle school playground assholes. Much easier getting away from them than from your damn parents and siblings.\n\nI get that a significant amount of women are shallow and mean, so I'm not trying to invaludate negative experiences you've had so far. But if you genuinely believe your height is the one reason you don't have a romantic relationship, you've started to believe the horrible things your family has told you for years. A therapist can help you unpack that, connect eith yourself and people around you and seriously improve your quality of life.\n\nBest of luck OP and NTA", "Because you have a sh1t family that makes fun of you fir things completely out of your control, and that's affecting how you view yourself? Sounds like a great reason for therapy. Therapy isn't a punishment, it's to build skills to accept one's self and to be able to find coping mechanisms to live to the fullest.", "Mention one of these uncomfortable facts here on Reddit, and suddenly everyone's a 6'1 woman who totally dated 4'11 guys. \n\nApparently a situation where (even a certain subset of) men might get the short end of the stick is simply not acceptable.

Try not to let it make you resentful because there's nothing less attractive and it tends to come across.

It's harder if you are poor. Some people blame being bald.\n\n\n\n\n99.9% of people have some sort of issue to overcome.

Confidence and self knowledge can go a hell of a lot further than other superficial stuff.", "This sounds like a confidence issue to me, which is understandable. You're so used to being put down for your height by your family that you think everyone will react that way, so maybe you don't put yourself out there as much (and it's already really hard to put yourself out there!). And it's easier and less frightening to say, \"Well, no one will ever date me because I'm short, it's my parents' fault, and there's nothing I can ever do to change how I interact with people.\" \n\nBut there's nothing you can do about your height, and you can't go back and change the past. Your parents probably will never give you a satisfactory apology, especially after years of bullying you for a situation they caused through neglect. And what they did *sucks*, but people who suck will rarely allow themselves to see it. \n\nI think this is something to go to therapy over. The only thing you can really do about it is accept that what's done is done, and try to find more confidence, and a therapist can help with that. Be a short king, dude. Maybe you could find some clothes that fit well and make you feel better about yourself. Get a cool haircut. There's always going to be some women who reject short men, no matter what, but I promise there are also a lot of women out there who react more to confidence and charm than height.", "You don't have the option because of your personality, not your height.

By no means do I think a short(er) man can't get married or find a girlfriend, but it is absolutely a hurdle that taller men don't have, and it's not solely an attitude problem. I'm taller than OP and I really can't tell you how many online dating profiles I used to see (when I was still in the dating game) that specified that no one under a certain height (usually well above mine) should apply, or how many women seemed to take me less seriously because I was short. And some of my own bad attitude about it (which I had to consciously overcome, for sure) stemmed from the fact that it was constantly being reinforced by the messages I was getting about it from potential dating partners and from the culture at large. It's sort of like talking about baldness, or excess weight, or a physical disability, or whatever other physical attribute. Sure, these things don't outright stop someone from dating but they are, typically, at least something that makes it more of a challenge. It reduces your pool. \n \nNow, of course bad attitude doesn't HELP...it's a major factor, and there are enough women who either don't care about height or are short enough that it doesn't really matter. (My wife likes that we're the same height because she can look me in the eye. She's not into super tall dudes.) This is just to say that I think it can be simplistic attributing it entirely to one thing or another.
