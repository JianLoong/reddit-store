I\u2019m 7 years older than my sister because my mom had some serious complications when pregnant with me and didn\u2019t want another one but my father threatened divorce because he wanted a boy but was angry my sister came out and continued to complain he only had daughters. \n\nNow I\u2019m(29F) a dentist and because of my father I\u2019m really sensitive to bullshit from any guy I date. I make a lot more than anyone else in my age group so I at least expect my partner to do equal chores. I haven\u2019t yet met a guy who will do equal chores(most say they will but in practice think equal chores is mowing the lawn once a week). and most don\u2019t like the thought I will probably be the main breadwinner. One even suggested I reduce my hours if we were to marry so that I can do more housework. In my parents day the person who made less (my mom) usually quit their job and took care of everything but now when it\u2019s the guys making less expecting them to wash dishes and vacuum is somehow asking for too much?

My parents have a super toxic relationship, and both of them have been a really good role model on what not to put up with. Both are addicts but one was addicted to drugs and alcohol, while another is addicted to more socially acceptable things like nicotine, sugar, and gambling. Both are verbally and physically abusive. One of them is a serial cheater, and the other is unapologetically co-dependent. This has led to me largely avoiding relationships for most of my life, and calling it quits early when boundaries are crossed or someone thinks verbal abuse is no big deal. They both want me to get a girlfriend right now, and they don't understand why I'm choosing to work on myself instead.  Funny enough for me it's my Mom that's slightly more toxic than my dad since she believes in toxic gender rolls, verbal abuse and the idea that a woman can't physically abuse a man because he's stronger.

Then helped with the buisness side once they were older", "As a teen and young adult I thought men who would be equal partners were fictional, so obviously I'd never have a long term relationship. I'm happy to say I was proven wrong.\n\nNTA. Keep your standards and your honesty.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad sucks.  Keep making that money", "Yeah with the expectations OP has, when she finds someone who can meet them, she\u2019s going to have a fantastic relationship and it\u2019ll be worth the wait. \n\nBut she can not settle.", "Yeah well, dad's probably the type that thinks that women should get married as soon as it's legal to and if they wait any longer than that they're just being too picky.", "she is not looking for a partner who will do more if he makes less, she is looking for a partner who will do the bare minimum and be an actual equal partner. she doesn't need to lower those standards", "Im a woman who has been in the wrong relationship with the wrong man- seriously unhappy.\n\nI've been single- very happy.\n\nI've been with man who is a true partner- happiest of all. \n\nThe right partner really can enhance your life- honest! But yeah, you're way better off being single than with the wrong one.", "I forgot where this quote was from, but essentially it\u2019s MUCH better to be alone than with someone who makes you lonely.", "KEEP THOSE STANDARDS HIGH BOO-BOO.\n\nYou only receive better when you demand better. Part of demanding better is rejecting everything that doesn\u2019t cut it. Your dad ain\u2019t shit and you\u2019re wise to ignore every shred of his garbage dating advice.", "My dad and mom have been married 40 years and he demeans her so often, it\u2019s second nature to him. When he asks me why I\u2019m not married I ask him what\u2019s in it for me and he gets upset. He was a great dad and a very mediocre husband. My mom is like yours, always told us to understand him and just keep the peace with him, still does everything for him. This generation is definitely aware of how marriages are not some fairy tale but a lot of unappreciated labor.\n\nNTA", "I feel the same way. \nI\u2019m not a build-in cook, maid and housekeeper.\nA relationship is a partnership. Either we both contribute or there is no we.", "NTA He called you a \u201ccrazy feminist\u201d like that was a insult or something.", "NTA. \n\nWho are these idiots though. I work a pretty basic low stress job. I would love it if my wife made way more than me and i did 70-80% of the housework. Sign me up. How is that not a great deal as long as she isn\u2019t a dick about it?", "NTA. Lmao. Not even remotely. Have people genuinely suggested that you work less so you can do more chores? That's fantastic - the gall of them. Your dad sounds like a prick and I'm happy you haven't accidentally absorbed your parents' relationship as a standard you should adhere to - it is absolutely horrible and you were right to call your dad out like that.", "Fuck if the girl I'm married to made enough money to support both of us and kids hell yeah I'm quitting my job and going Stay at home. I'd have the house spotless and food cooked and everything. The food isn't a big deal as I love cooking but still.", "NTA better single than sorry. Sounds like you're doing great and there's more to life than having babies", "NTA at all \u2026. Buuut enjoy the single life", "NTA.", "Lol dudes who won\u2019t wash the dishes are fucking losers. Edit: NTA", "ESH. Your father is obviously an AH, but, c'mon. You can't stand what  your mother was forced to endure because your father was the breadwinner, but then you insist that any guy you date endures the same dynamic because you make more money. You sound like a nightmare.", "NTA. \nI fail to see how your marital status affects your father at all. What you do with your life and who you share or, in this case, don't share it with, is your business, not his. Is he going to suffer somehow from your singledom? Any man worth the title of father should be happier to see his daughter happy and single rather than miserable and married.", "NTA. We're the 6 different. Your parents' marriage was crappy because of how he treated your mom, so you want to be sure you don't marry someone like him. My parents' marriage was the partnership you desired, so I wouldn't settle for less. I'm 63, never married. Do I wish I'd found that special someone like my mom did? Of course. But it is far better to be single than with someone who makes you miserable."]}
