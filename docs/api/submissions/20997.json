My father did the whole work outside the house and my mom did everything else. Cooking, cleaning, raising both my sister and I etc. Honestly any normal person probably would have left my father but my mom is very against divorce so made it work at all costs. I\u2019m 7 years older than my sister because my mom had some serious complications when pregnant with me and didn\u2019t want another one but my father threatened divorce because he wanted a boy but was angry my sister came out and continued to complain he only had daughters. \n\nNow I\u2019m(29F) a dentist and because of my father I\u2019m really sensitive to bullshit from any guy I date. I make a lot more than anyone else in my age group so I at least expect my partner to do equal chores. I haven\u2019t yet met a guy who will do equal chores(most say they will but in practice think equal chores is mowing the lawn once a week). and most don\u2019t like the thought I will probably be the main breadwinner. One even suggested I reduce my hours if we were to marry so that I can do more housework. In my parents day the person who made less (my mom) usually quit their job and took care of everything but now when it\u2019s the guys making less expecting them to wash dishes and vacuum is somehow asking for too much? Or they will just claim a pigsty is acceptable and not clean. \n\nAnyway because of this I\u2019m still happily single because I refuse to tolerate what my mom did. My father is always complaining about my singleness to me, my sister my mom and anyone who will hear saying I\u2019m make too much for guys to be comfortable with and I\u2019m too old to be picky so I should just marry anyone. He did this again recently and I yelled at him that he\u2019s the reason I won\u2019t tolerate bullshit because I refuse to be treated like how he treat my mom and he stormed off calling me a \u201ccrazy feminist\u201d. My mom keeps defending him saying not to take it personally and he wants the best for me but I\u2019m convinced he just wants me barefoot and pregnant cause he\u2019s old fashioned as hell.", "created_utc": 1688150421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n8gl5/aita_for_yelling_at_my_father_i_refuse_to_marry_a/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t you dare feel bad for what you said. It\u2019s the truth.", "Congratulations on being so successful at such a young age! Wait it out for the guy who will not be scared of your income - you won't necessarily be the sole breadwinner - or your independence and desire for equity in the relationship. They exist but they are sometimes not ripe until later on. NTA.", "LOL too old?  You're 29!  Stick with your guns, your dad is the AH in this scenario.  You've got EXCELLENT expectations - don't settle for anything less!  Good things come to those who wait.  NTA  Good luck!", "NTA. \n\nWhy are you putting up with this bullshit?\n\nThe only things missing from your post is \"Would it knock you out to smile more?\" and \"If you reject every abusive moron with a short violent temper, a forked tongue and a drinking problem, you might be left on the shelf!\". Oh wait, they already said the last bit.\n\nYou are worth more than this.", "NTA. You are right about your father.", "NTA. I completely get. There are so many men that were unfortunately raised seeing their dads not helping around the house or women raising men and not making chores a part of their life. Then they genuinely do think mowing the grass, taking out the trash and doing \"projects\" *is* contributing. I mean, it is but that's not a fair share of the workload.\n\nI've lost this argument with my partner. But I damn sure am teaching my son to cook, clean, do dishes, laundry etc. because I don't want *him* to be that partner. He's a teen and knows how to clean better than his dad lol.", "NTA\n\nYou arent \"crazy feminist\", you are \"normal feminist\". Like, the actual normal definition of feminist. You do normal human stuff, expecting other people to treat you as such, and being a woman is just extra info on top.\n\nIf you say you are happily single, stay being happily single. Just make sure to yourself you arent staying single \"out of spite\" to you father.", "NTA.  I won't judge your parents for their relationship dynamics (okay fine I will but not out loud) but I don't blame you for wanting something better, and your father needs to drop it.\n\nAlso, it *should* be possible to find a better - or at least more appropriate for you - quality of man.  They are out there; clearly you aren't finding them, so it might be worth it to figure out if there is somewhere else to look.", "NTA primarily because it sounds like this is NOT the first comment he's made. Everyone reaches their breaking point and, as someone from an equally conservative family, it isn't always pretty.\n\nWhile I'm sure the ideal would be calmly explaining how it makes you uncomfortable and that being respected, we are regrettably human and that leads to opinions and confrontation.\n\nIf you're able, maybe try and explain, regardless of his opinion on your life, you are your own person and have your own ideals, some of which may not align with his. You're happy (I assume) with where you are in life.\n\nSorry you had to go through this OP and that it got to this point. Victim blaming is real and that's what's happened here.", "NTA. If your dad doesn't like honest answers, he should shut up and refrain from asking questions. You are never too old to be picky. The decision to marry (or not) is one of the most important decisions you will ever make in your life. It's definitely not something you should rush for fear of being \"too old.\"  The fact is that any guy worth marrying will respect your expectations. Don't settle for any less.  Wanting an equal partner doesn't make you a feminist. It makes you smart.", "NTA", "NTA your father sounds like a real prize, saying that you should dull your own shine and get married to someone who will drag you down.\n\nStay single until you find someone of the same caliber as yourself who will support your achievements just as you support his.\n\nAlso re housework this is my old favorite from 1970 [Politics of Housework](https://caringlabor.wordpress.com/2010/09/11/pat-mainardi-the-politics-of-housework/)", "NTA, and sorry there hasn't been that guy for ya.

You get to be choosey about who you want to spend you time with. Money doesn't matter because if you met a guy who out earned you it would still be important that each of you took on the responsibility of a household. You aren't a crazy feminist. Nope you just are nobody's doormat.", "ESH.  There is some important stuff in your post, but really you just came here to validate your position in endlessly repeating family drama.\n\nBut what about you?  You didn't grow up with a great family life, you're still angry as an adult, and you are \"happily single\" because you believe every man you've come in contact with is closer to your dad than to your standard of what a man should be.  That doesn't sound like a recipe for being \"happily\" anything.  I think you should consider counseling to better understand your anger, to extract yourself from these recurring pointless pokes from your dad, and to get to the life \\*you\\* deserve.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My parents have a super toxic relationship, and both of them have been a really good role model on what not to put up with. Both are addicts but one was addicted to drugs and alcohol, while another is addicted to more socially acceptable things like nicotine, sugar, and gambling. Both are verbally and physically abusive. One of them is a serial cheater, and the other is unapologetically co-dependent. This has led to me largely avoiding relationships for most of my life, and calling it quits early when boundaries are crossed or someone thinks verbal abuse is no big deal. They both want me to get a girlfriend right now, and they don't understand why I'm choosing to work on myself instead.  Funny enough for me it's my Mom that's slightly more toxic than my dad since she believes in toxic gender rolls, verbal abuse and the idea that a woman can't physically abuse a man because he's stronger. Anyway, trauma dump aside sometimes you need to ignore these kinds of people because they wouldn't know a healthy relationship because it never smacked them in the face.", "Nta. What man doesn't dream of being a house husband?", "NTA \n\nNever settle, you will find who you're looking for. Your dad however, is a piece of work.

We're almost a year and five months together.", "Definitely NTA. Keep standing your ground against him.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, single. I'll quit my job and be a househusband. I can even do laundry and cook, don't drink, and like cats. Hmu. Lol.\n\nSeriously, though, you're fine. Your bar of expectations is just fine where it is.", "NTA. That being said, try not to respond when he is being ridiculous.  It is a fruitless conversation, and it looks like your mother gets stuck in the middle.

Good for you, standing up for yourself. I\u2019m a guy and don\u2019t put up with your partner treating you like a maid or housekeeper.
