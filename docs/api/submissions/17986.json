{"id": 17986, "submission_id": "13ppyot", "title": "AITA for refusing to shoulder the burden of my in-laws' retirement?", "selftext": "My FIL and MIL, both in their late 60s, are facing financial difficulties. FIL is still working while MIL is dependent on him. Unfortunately, FIL's gambling habit has left them with significant debt and no assets. Unlike some countries, there is no government system in place to support the elderly in our country. To assist them, we have been paying half of their monthly rent and helping with their food and healthcare expenses. FIL constantly borrows money without repaying it. But, we only lend what we can afford to lose.\n\nAs FIL is getting older, and we are unsure how much longer he can continue working. Moreover, my wife's elder sister and brother are also in similar financial situations due to their own poor choices and habits, making it unlikely that they can provide assistance. As the only person in our families with a stable job and good income, my in-laws and wife are pressuring me to fully fund my parents-in-law's retirement. While I sympathize with their predicament, I am hesitant to shoulder this ongoing liability of taking care of them until the end of their lives.\n\nThey suggest that expenses would significantly decrease if we let them move into our house. However, based on our past experience of living with them for a few months, it did not work well due to our contrasting lifestyles and their desire to exert influence over our decisions. Additionally, their poor hygiene habits, such as using our personal items instead of their own, and the use of inappropriate language, create further concerns. I have expressed to my wife that neither option\u2014financially supporting them nor having them live with us\u2014is acceptable to me.\n\nIn the past, I once paid off all their debts so they could start afresh without the burden of debt. Within a month, they found themselves back in debt. I reminded my wife that their financial struggles are not a result of my actions but of their own choices. Moreover, I do not believe I owe them anything based on past circumstances, whether in terms of financial or physical support. I don't consider myself responsible for their well-being.  My wife raises the question of whether we should let them starve in their old age.\n\nShe also points out that my parents are not financially struggling, so I may not fully understand her feelings. However, I have explained to her the need to prioritize our own family's future and financial stability. My income is the sole source for our family, and if anything were to happen to me or my stable income, we would be left with nothing. We currently have no savings for retirement or our child's education. Continuing to give everything we have would eventually lead us down the same path as her parents.\n\nDespite my explanations, they persist in guilt-tripping me. While I recognize that I am not obligated to help them, their constant pressure makes me feel like I am enjoying a plate full of good food while others in the room are starving. AITA?\n\nMore Info:\n\nSince I work remotely, I also contribute to the household tasks. However, I still require assistance because we have an eight-year-old son. My wife doesn't work since her income would essentially cover the expenses of hiring someone to help with the household, leading her to believe that her work efforts wouldn't make a significant difference.\r  \n\r  \nOur income is not divided. Both of us have access to it and can use it as needed, but we make it a point to inform each other about our expenditures, particularly for significant expenses. Personally, since I am home all the time, I don't spend anything on myself.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1684851658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ppyot/aita_for_refusing_to_shoulder_the_burden_of_my/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not let them get to you, they need to learn (regardless of age) at some point that their actions have consequences and they have to live with their choices. They won't starve, there are options for them to make money, even in their old age (think Walmart door greeting or something). Please, do not put your own family in jeopardy by continuing to give them money or frankly, pay for anything for them. The sooner they learn this lesson, the better.

It will ruin your relationship with them and probably your wife too.  \nThe parents are doing bad financial decisions, because they don't feel the consequences of them.

Is their entire family so inept financially and wildly irresponsible that none of them work but all borrow and get into trouble? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTime for some harsh truths. They're all living beyond their means and alienating those around them and expecting someone else to fund their lifestyles whilst providing nothing in return. What on earth? They become reliant on your income, debts being paid off ... so they get more, and more, and more. But now it's *your* problem to solve, you're bankrolling them, it's a very dangerous slippery slope.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat would they do if you and your wife weren't together? How would your wife fund them? Sounds like she couldn't. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey need to stop spending, down-size to what they can afford (if anything) and seek help for the gambling/spending addicitons or habits. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe fact they're going down the easy route of guilt-tripping family instead of actually addressing the issue like adults and taking responsibility tells me you'll get saddled with tons of debt that you'll likely never get free from until they're no longer around.

Out of the goodness of his heart, he shouldered the cost of both of their retirements. Both of them ran into money issues, started acting different, and the added costs with no support from anyone else started to add up. The effort of trying to provide for his new family as well as for his parents almost killed him.\n\nI actually think letting them live in your house would be making the problem worse, because the decrease in costs might make your FIL feel like he has more money to spend, since he is still working. Don't feed the flames.\n\nHowever, I am worried for your wife. These are her parents and I don't know if she would be able to sit idly by. She may be driven to do something drastic, so please be mindful of that, and please be there for her. This is not an easy situation.\n\nHonestly, I have no suggestions for you.

Their lack of planning for their retirement is not your problem. It's not like they went to sleep one day at 25, and woke up the next at 65. They have had more than half a century to save. Now they're coming to someone else AGAIN to not only bail them out, but to continue to support them indefinitely.", "NTA.

Absolutely NTA. Stop giving them any money. If he has a gambling problem he needs help. If anything offer to pay for that, but that is still way more than you should feel necessary. I have in-laws that simply cannot afford themselves due to various personal and life choices. It really sucks to watch someone you care about make bad decisions and have to suffer the consequences but they are currently accepting your help and still finding ways to abuse that. They haven\u2019t shown once that they will accept the help and be content and grateful. He will continue gambling and at some point begin to need you to finance the gambling debt again too. That simply isn\u2019t ok.

You've done enough. My husband and I talk about my parents and we give them money each month for a debt they were forced to take. We spoke at length about how much support we were willing to provide them and the answer is we would make sure they are able to live (i.e. a roof, food, clothes, and reasonable transportation) but everything else is on them. And our money is to only be used for the things we tell them it's for, and only as long as they continue to respect us. If they use our food money to buy something else, they don't get more.\n\nYour in-laws seem to fail my would-be rules. They're pretty simple rules imho. Your money is your money, and your child comes first before anyone else. Don't let her bully you into anything you don't want to do. You work hard for that money and what you choose to do with it is your business. \n\nIf you do give them money, I'd look into trusts if they're an option where you live. It'd give you much more control and allow you to see where the money is being spent. If not a trust, get a separate joint bank account with the in-laws for the same purpose, where you trickle funds in.", "NTA and I hope you got a prenup.", "Info: why can\u2019t your wife get a job and then she can support her leechy parents", "NTA\n\nWhile it\u2019s good to be cognizant of your wife\u2019s feelings towards her family, it\u2019s not your responsibility to shoulder the burden of their debt\u2014 especially if they show no signs of improving. \n\nYou have given them plenty of support throughout the years and instead of being grateful and using it as an opportunity to improve they\u2019ve continued to squeeze you for money. Gambling is an addiction, which is a mental illness, but you can\u2019t put your happiness and well-being on the line to support his. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s still a difficult situation that you\u2019re in. You don\u2019t want to support them further and feel like you\u2019re throwing money away, but you also want to make your wife happy and not put stress on your relationship. A compromise might be able to be struck in this situation. If I were in your shoes, I would consider banding together with your wife and offering her parents a deal. To ensure that you\u2019re not wasting your money and you\u2019re having some benefit, say that they can live with you if your MIL does cooking and cleaning, if they follow boundaries you set on their involvement in your lives, and you have complete access to their finances. This is your house and your life, you deserve respect and to know that the money you\u2019re spending is going to good use. If they cross boundaries constantly, they don\u2019t carry their weight in the house, and he\u2019s using any money for gambling, then it\u2019s obvious that they don\u2019t need your help that much and you stop supporting them. This way, you are able to provide an option to them that might be bearable for you (which still shows your wife that her family is important), but you also have an out if things go sideways. \n\nGood luck!", "INFO: why does your wife not work?

NTA", "Depends on what country OP lives in.\n\nDoesn't sound like OP lives in USA, Canada, or a Western European country if the country doesn't have some sort of Social Security or pension scheme.", "Your wife needs to work, not for her parents but for herself and her husband and child. \nAnd be clear to her OP, your NOT responsible for her parents, you're the sole income I'm your family and you can't maintain leeches that will eventually and without a doubt drown you in debt.  \nYou have no savings, if something happens to you what would happen to your child? Your wife is an enabler and her family are financially irresponsible.\n\nNTA but rethink that marriage.", "I just read your other post about you financially providing for your wife\u2019s deadbeat sister throughout her 3 pregnancies. You have ALLOWED these shameless leeches to take fully advantage of you for years. This is on YOU. Sorry but YOU are the reason you are in this mess. You need to grow a backbone FAST because this is beyond pathetic. You SIL has a husband! Why the hell did you agree to pay for her childbirth bills thrice!!? Your wife is your biggest enemy she should have YOUR back but all she cares about is her family, NOT you and NOT your child. Your wife is enabling her parents and sister. \n\nYou need to get the F away from these bloody mooches because they will suck you dry for EVERY penny for the rest of your life. Pack your bags and go stay with your parents for a few months. Grow a spine and learn to say NO. Tell your pathetic wife to get a job so she can support her OWN family because apparently her family means MORE than you and the life you two have together. They will never stop begging for more money. Either your wife is on your side or you will have to make a choice whether you still want to be married to this woman AND her family because clearly they are a package deal and the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. Watch your back and grow a spine.", "You say that if you're wife worked, her income would essentially cover the expenses of hiring someone to help with the household -- what does that mean?  What kind of income would she have?  Did she go to college or a trade school?  Also, why wouldn't you both still be able to cover household duties?  People with a two-income household do so all the time.", "Agree with this entirely -- the more that's shared, the more it's coming across that the wife deliberately picked someone with a good income precisely BECAUSE her family needed so much financial help.  \n\nThe poster is 27 years old with an eight year old child.  That means that the son was born when the poster was NINETEEN and his wife twenty-one."]}
