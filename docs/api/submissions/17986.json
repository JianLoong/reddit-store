{"id": 17986, "submission_id": "13ppyot", "title": "AITA for refusing to shoulder the burden of my in-laws' retirement?", "selftext": "My FIL and MIL, both in their late 60s, are facing financial difficulties. FIL is still working while MIL is dependent on him. Unfortunately, FIL's gambling habit has left them with significant debt and no assets. Unlike some countries, there is no government system in place to support the elderly in our country. To assist them, we have been paying half of their monthly rent and helping with their food and healthcare expenses. FIL constantly borrows money without repaying it. But, we only lend what we can afford to lose.\n\nAs FIL is getting older, and we are unsure how much longer he can continue working. Moreover, my wife's elder sister and brother are also in similar financial situations due to their own poor choices and habits, making it unlikely that they can provide assistance. As the only person in our families with a stable job and good income, my in-laws and wife are pressuring me to fully fund my parents-in-law's retirement. While I sympathize with their predicament, I am hesitant to shoulder this ongoing liability of taking care of them until the end of their lives.\n\nThey suggest that expenses would significantly decrease if we let them move into our house. However, based on our past experience of living with them for a few months, it did not work well due to our contrasting lifestyles and their desire to exert influence over our decisions. Additionally, their poor hygiene habits, such as using our personal items instead of their own, and the use of inappropriate language, create further concerns. I have expressed to my wife that neither option\u2014financially supporting them nor having them live with us\u2014is acceptable to me.\n\nIn the past, I once paid off all their debts so they could start afresh without the burden of debt. Within a month, they found themselves back in debt. I reminded my wife that their financial struggles are not a result of my actions but of their own choices. Moreover, I do not believe I owe them anything based on past circumstances, whether in terms of financial or physical support. I don't consider myself responsible for their well-being.  My wife raises the question of whether we should let them starve in their old age.\n\nShe also points out that my parents are not financially struggling, so I may not fully understand her feelings. However, I have explained to her the need to prioritize our own family's future and financial stability. My income is the sole source for our family, and if anything were to happen to me or my stable income, we would be left with nothing. We currently have no savings for retirement or our child's education. Continuing to give everything we have would eventually lead us down the same path as her parents.\n\nDespite my explanations, they persist in guilt-tripping me. While I recognize that I am not obligated to help them, their constant pressure makes me feel like I am enjoying a plate full of good food while others in the room are starving. AITA?\n\nMore Info:\n\nSince I work remotely, I also contribute to the household tasks. However, I still require assistance because we have an eight-year-old son. My wife doesn't work since her income would essentially cover the expenses of hiring someone to help with the household, leading her to believe that her work efforts wouldn't make a significant difference.\r  \n\r  \nOur income is not divided. Both of us have access to it and can use it as needed, but we make it a point to inform each other about our expenditures, particularly for significant expenses. Personally, since I am home all the time, I don't spend anything on myself.\n\nAdditional Info for questions:\n\nIn my country, the school day is typically less than half a day in the morning, From preparing my child before school, ensuring meals are taken care of, managing transportation to and from school, handling cooking, grocery shopping, cleaning, laundry, and dishes, to arranging private tutoring and assisting with projects \u2013 these tasks consume a significant amount of time. \n\nWhile there are occasional breaks in between, it remains challenging to concentrate on work and maintain productivity. Remote work is still work, requiring focus and dedication.\n\nWhen it comes to part-time and night shift employment opportunities, they are scarce and difficult to find for her. Moreover, the remuneration for such jobs is typically inadequate, considering transportation and other associated costs. The effort put into these positions often yields a ridiculously low income, making them hardly worth pursuing.\n\nI had been supporting her education, but she discontinued her studies while still a university student. Her prospects of securing a good job are significantly diminished. The combination of extreme traffic and long working hours in our country makes it even more challenging. If she were to engage in a regular job, she would have to start her day as early as 6 am and return home around 9 pm.", "created_utc": 1684851658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ppyot/aita_for_refusing_to_shoulder_the_burden_of_my/", "score": 566, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They won't starve, there are options for them to make money, even in their old age (think Walmart door greeting or something).

They're all living beyond their means and alienating those around them and expecting someone else to fund their lifestyles whilst providing nothing in return. What on earth?

But now it's *your* problem to solve, you're bankrolling them, it's a very dangerous slippery slope.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat would they do if you and your wife weren't together?

The effort of trying to provide for his new family as well as for his parents almost killed him.\n\nI actually think letting them live in your house would be making the problem worse, because the decrease in costs might make your FIL feel like he has more money to spend, since he is still working.

Absolutely NTA. Stop giving them any money. If he has a gambling problem he needs help. If anything offer to pay for that, but that is still way more than you should feel necessary.

It really sucks to watch someone you care about make bad decisions and have to suffer the consequences but they are currently accepting your help and still finding ways to abuse that. They haven\u2019t shown once that they will accept the help and be content and grateful. He will continue gambling and at some point begin to need you to finance the gambling debt again too.

And our money is to only be used for the things we tell them it's for, and only as long as they continue to respect us. If they use our food money to buy something else, they don't get more.\n\nYour in-laws seem to fail my would-be rules. They're pretty simple rules imho. Your money is your money, and your child comes first before anyone else. Don't let her bully you into anything you don't want to do. You work hard for that money and what you choose to do with it is your business. \n\nIf you do give them money, I'd look into trusts if they're an option where you live. It'd give you much more control and allow you to see where the money is being spent. If not a trust, get a separate joint bank account with the in-laws for the same purpose, where you trickle funds in.", "NTA and I hope you got a prenup.", "Info: why can\u2019t your wife get a job and then she can support her leechy parents", "NTA\n\nWhile it\u2019s good to be cognizant of your wife\u2019s feelings towards her family, it\u2019s not your responsibility to shoulder the burden of their debt\u2014 especially if they show no signs of improving. \n\nYou have given them plenty of support throughout the years and instead of being grateful and using it as an opportunity to improve they\u2019ve continued to squeeze you for money.

You don\u2019t want to support them further and feel like you\u2019re throwing money away, but you also want to make your wife happy and not put stress on your relationship. A compromise might be able to be struck in this situation. If I were in your shoes, I would consider banding together with your wife and offering her parents a deal. To ensure that you\u2019re not wasting your money and you\u2019re having some benefit, say that they can live with you if your MIL does cooking and cleaning, if they follow boundaries you set on their involvement in your lives, and you have complete access to their finances. This is your house and your life, you deserve respect and to know that the money you\u2019re spending is going to good use. If they cross boundaries constantly, they don\u2019t carry their weight in the house, and he\u2019s using any money for gambling, then it\u2019s obvious that they don\u2019t need your help that much and you stop supporting them.
