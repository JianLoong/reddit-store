As a baseline, she should have treatment goals that are measurable and achievable. Try asking your wife what goals she and her therapist have outlined for her to be working toward, or even just a yes or no question about whether she's set any for herself. If she says she doesn't have any or that they never talk about setting goals, then it's definitely time for a new therapist. If she has some goals that she's supposedly been working on for a while but can't describe any progress on, you could try using the concrete lack of progress as your justification for wanting her to try a different provider. It would be hard to argue that it's a race or gender thing when you're armed with evidence for why her current treatment has not produced results. Depending on how long she's been going, a good therapist would recognize that the relationship has been unproductive and refer her to someone else.", "She\u2019s been going for 10 months\u2026a sharp sharp decline but the doctor (psychiatrist) doesn\u2019t care because the checks keep clearing.\n\nShe was seeing a male psychiatrist and was doing great and then one day decided she NEEDED a female one, was not up for debate.\n\nOutside of writing the check she refuses to tell me one word about what goes on there.

Threaten to stop going? It's already not working. Divorce you? You're already arriving to that on your own. At this point, the stress of this relationship is shaving years off your life. I'd be demanding a new doctor on condition of payment and also probably insisting to be present for the sessions or at least included in the treatment plan. If she won't get on board with that, a divorce is warranted. Her ship is going down. You can cut her loose and start rebuilding without her or go down with her. Good luck to you.", "Thank you for your guidance and words and time\n\nIt is really appreciated", "NTA but OP, we are past the point of it being a question about assholery. You're in trouble.\n\nThat settlement was supposed to help cover the cost of your injuries, including future problems that arise out of the injuries you sustained in the accident, and which may not yet be present, as well as *your* potential loss of income due to being unable to perform certain kinds of work. That settlement was **not** \"our\" (yours and your wife's) settlement. That settlement was for **you**. It was **your** settlement. \n\nThat money should have been put away in an investment account, with either passive index funds, a HYSA, a CD, or treasury bills. It should not have been spent on bills or on increasing your cost of living, because that is not sustainable. Financially speaking, you are in a car going 80mph toward a cliff, and you have no brakes. You need to put a stop to this now, because the money you got from that settlement was never \"fun money\". It has been squandered.\n\nSince your other comments have made it clear that your wife is not interested in talking, you need to accept the time for talk is gone and make plans to separate. You should start looking into other ways to support yourself and your daughter, such as moving to be close to family for childcare support while you work. I don't know what the best solution is for you, but I can tell you that unless your wife is willing to pull her weight again, staying with her is not the solution.", "NTA. I doubt you'll be able to shake her out of whatever it is going on with her, which is difficult because it makes you feel completely helpless. If people can't admit there's an issue, you can't talk them into believing it, usually.\n\nAs far as what you can control, you can either get used to this new normal and adjust, or you can leave.\n\nAs an adjustment (if you're not ready for the end), you could force her into taking your current role and go back to work outside of the home in whatever way you can, even if you feel it's not worth it with what you'd bring in vs her earning power. If you go to work full-time it means she would have to take over all the daily care and home-schooling of your child that is currently your job (assumed from your writing, correct me if that's not the case. It seems as though you're single-parenting).  It may have her searching for another job fairly quickly when she feels the demands of that.\n\nI'd also recommend downsizing and moving to a new area with a lower COL. Maybe write out a list of consequences for the family that are heading your way if she doesn't get her act together - she will now be the new daytime caregiver and teacher of child while you go to work, no more therapy, downsizing living circumstances and area to fit the new income, no holidays, $ limits on gifts, more budgeting of household expenses, downsizing vehicles, etc. Manage your money and life now while you still have something left and you still have the options that affords you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add - do not invest in a business for her. She has proven over time that she's lacking in motivation, work ethic, dedication and stick-to-it-ness. Tell her to get a job, stick with it, and start a dedicated savings plan so she can work towards whatever dream business she has in mind. If it means enough to her she'll work for it, and if she can't/won't it's a sign that business would fail anyway.", "Honestly I\u2019d be pretty pissed too if my fianc\u00e9 acted like this. She needs to get a job & stick to it. Not a chance would I let a man pay for me I love my independence too much & went back to uni in my late 20s just to get the career I always wanted. You\u2019re suppose to be a partnership when married & she doesn\u2019t seem to care. Sit her down & talk through it all. If she doesn\u2019t listen or acknowledge the financial difficulties then maybe you need to tell her you\u2019re no longer compatible", "NTA, she's really not helping herself is she?
