She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this:\n\nHer: \"So what does your husband do?\"\n\nMe: \"He works in finance.\"\n\nHer: \"Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary.\" *Polite smile*\n\nHer: \"Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??\"\n\nMe: *Awkward chuckle* \"I'd rather not say, but it's up there!\"\n\nHer: \"What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??\"\n\nMe: *Visibly annoyed* \"No, I just prefer not to say.\"\n\nHer: *Laughs in my face* \"You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!\"\n\nMe: \"You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.\"\n\nThen I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused.

OP seems catty and vindictive as hell.", "Honestly, the more I read the post and the comments, the more it feels like OP was humble bragging and then was surprised when someone got nosy. IF this actually happened, she enjoyed gloating. Then was surprised it bit her in the ass. I even get a little bit if a humble brag vibe from the post. (The inclusion that she already makes a lot, \"haha!\") Maybe if you don't want someone to ask your husband's salary, don't start insinuating about how much money he makes??\n\nObviously, I agree with ESH because just because OP opens up the possibility doesn't mean coworker SHOULD.", "If I could add anything, OP doing this at a happy hour is no excuse.

She is here, too. She's not giving details as in dollar amount but she's insinuating a lot. Maybe she shouldn't be insinuating so much if she's so worried about her personal info and people being ~nosy.~ She clearly enjoys telling people how rich she is.", "But she didn\u2019t try to tell her it was inappropriate. She gave vague answers that baited the coworker to press on. OP was being coy, she wasn\u2019t putting up a clear enough boundary that the question was rude to ask.

MUCH BIGGER. You shouldn't at all be saying this should be a valuable lesson to her. You were in the wrong. You should apologize for what you said and move on, and hope she doesn't go to HR. Calling a coworker a bitch is a firable offense.

I know everyone\u2019s going to downvote me for this, but I really hate when people call women the B or C word. Your coworker deserved to be called out, yes, but you could have just stuck with calling her nosy. There was no need to add the B word to the mix here. We women get enough shit just for being women, why add to it? And however much anyone thinks she deserves it, you still have to work with her.", "NtA. \n\nI would go to HR to discuss this. She is clearly in the wrong for discussing something private and not taking no for an answer. But she cried and now people are feeling bad for her, telling you to apologize.

That\u2019s really great that people want to discuss salary but frankly, I don\u2019t want to discuss my salary with people, and if I don\u2019t want to and I tell you I don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t get to keep pushing at me without me snapping on you. \n\nI should add that I\u2019m actually in favor of the concept in general and I\u2019m the first want to start swinging whenever some idiot manager tries to say that it\u2019s against the rules to discuss salaries.

I had one person claim that indeed, they were using certain capitalized words in the \"upper case sense.\" Pointing out politely that there is no such thing as upper case sense to most people  caused them to block me, but essentially that is a description of delusional thinking.  I know this to be pretty consistent with others, as I've seen a few random caps in my day.", "That's not an excuse.

I'm sure an office of mature adults would not be harsh on OP and newgirl would not be taken as seriously.\n\nOP, of you apologize then only apologize for using a curse word.

As stupid as it is, it\u2019s so deeply implanted into people\u2019s brains that this is the only way to move forward.\n\nWhich is why people are telling OP to give a fake apology, so not to upset everyone else in the office. My advice to OP is to not fake apologize and just take this to HR for them to sort out. It\u2019s really none of her business to know how much OP\u2019s husband makes and OP gave a valid response multiple times. At 25 she should know better than to keep pestering someone, then she cried to anyone who would listen and left work when she didn\u2019t get her way?
