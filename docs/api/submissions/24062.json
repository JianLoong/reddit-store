In the beginning I would entertain the nosy questions, but since I turned 30, I've adopted a \"take no shit\" attitude. When people ask me how much he makes, I no longer say anything.

You can just tell she craves wealth and status. She wears a bunch of flashy designer items and is always asking the ladies around the office which of the men are single.\n\nLast Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour. She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this:\n\nHer: \"So what does your husband do?\"\n\nMe: \"He works in finance.\"\n\nHer: \"Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary.\" *Polite smile*\n\nHer: \"Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??\"\n\nMe: *Awkward chuckle* \"I'd rather not say, but it's up there!\"\n\nHer: \"What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??\"\n\nMe: *Visibly annoyed* \"No, I just prefer not to say.\"\n\nHer: *Laughs in my face* \"You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!\"\n\nMe: \"You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.\"\n\nThen I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand \"salary talk\". I think she's old enough.

Ridiculous", "I wonder how many flies one can squat?", "We never learned it in school but questions by design are \nJudgemental , authoritative, alpha move , power position.\n\n\nThink about it who asks questions?\nTeachers their students cops judges boss , and you have to answer cause they have authority.\n\nBut even in social circles there's social pressure to answer. So navigating this with a question right back at them evens things out.", "I read that in Dame Maggie Smith's voice.", "\"Well, bless your heart. You must be so embarrassed for asking such an inappropriately personal question!\"", "Or just try and straight up steal OPs husband...", "OP was pushed to the limit, the girl just would quit!", "How or why should HR be engaged?\n\nThe girl was annoying but you are allowed to ask personal questions to your co-workers,  To call a co-worker a bitch is something HR would engage in..\n\nSo why HR?", "Tell her you and husband are welfare queens \ud83d\ude0e NTA", "Yeah, but stuck up isn't a gendered slur.", "Please Update after your Talk with HR", "They handle investments for pension funds, retail investors and insurance companies. So big bucks", "I've been at my company long enough to know how our HR department functions. You'll have to trust me on that one.", "Imagine never finding out that you're vastly underpaid in comparison to other people doing the same job at a different company because they won't tell you what they're making. You could lose out on so much money.", "You would tolerate it if you earn less than others. You will not tolerate it if you are earning more than your peers and don't want them to be jealous. We all have coworkers who are useless and get paid more. Getting to know that get paid more , people can ask for a raise or quit to find new jobs. Of course, they will generally hate the slackers who earn more.", "It is stupid rule to keep few people underpaid.", "Yeah, employers tend to do that, but that is never in your interest as an employee. Don't follow that stupid rule.", "Yeah, because companies want to pay as little as possible.", "Yep, same here in Poland. We have a law that says exactly that.", "It's not, some employer try to make it taboo, and there is sometimes companies trying to put such a clause in work contract, but it's an abusive one, which means it can't be enforced.  \n\n\nYou can choose not to share it, and people can't ask HR about it since it's personnal information, but you CAN share it", "It's preemptive\u2014to protect myself in the case that she wants to be vindictive.", "Just to be clear, We have a taboo about talking about it face to face but at least we can benchmark against our co-workers at home in front of our screens then use it as leverage for the salary discussion :)\n\nBut it is good since any one (media and you) can review politicians , bribes , cash flow and why OPs husband can fly her around the world etc.", "In that case, any work event you bring him too, she\u2019d look for any excuse to talk to and be near him. Women like her have no shame, and will stop at nothing of getting with the man they feel is their ticket to the Good Life.", "ouch. that one hurt", "Me too! \ud83d\ude48", "Me too.", "Yes you can ask your coworkers everything. But If they don't want to answer It's within their rights. This Girl overstepped and pushed even thought OP Said she didn't want To Talk about it. HR is there to create a workspace for everyone. WE also Had someone who overstepped bounderies and after an Talk with HR He was respectable and listened to His coworkers bounderies.", "What an incredibly revolting, unscrupulous remark.", "Imagine finding out that you as a new hire earn much more than any of the old employees, and because of your blabbery, they quitted, and company had to close your division/severly reduce your wage. You could lose out on whatever you're earning right now.\n\nBesides - 2 employers with the same title doesnt mean that they're equal. I work in IT and part of that is dragging big, heavy, metal cabinets to server rooms to secure devices in it (god forbid if there are stairs...). I have yet to see any of the female employees helping with that. Since i have additional duties, shouldnt i be paid more? But ofc nobody thinks of it, just jump on bandwagon \"we're both at the same position and you're earning more than me! Unfair!\".\n\nAlso part of job is salary negotiation. Otherwise... why even give a choice? I dont care what others earn, and nobody should be interested in what i earn.", "It\u2019s not just the employer, it\u2019s the entire country!", "Ok,  I don't know why but I get the feeling this is in the UK or USA?  \n\nNever seen so many comments on HR..    This would be a non issue where I live.\n\nBest of luck", "Yeah good as an anti-corruption measure too, I prefer it your way.", "I guess HR works in different ways around the globe..\n\nHR in my country would not even touch this from OP's view ..  maybe they would drive it from the co-workers aspect who got called a bitch  but just maybe depends on when and where it happend.", "Yeah, big wow, don\u2019t know how some people have the gal to act like this, looks like her plan isn\u2019t going to work for her. Hope HR don\u2019t fall for the crocodile tears.", "Is she at work or at a dating office? Jeez, she sounds so desperate.", "My thoughts exactly. At least you can say that girl knows what her priorities are ha!"]}
