She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this:\n\nHer: \"So what does your husband do?\"\n\nMe: \"He works in finance.\"\n\nHer: \"Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary.\" *Polite smile*\n\nHer: \"Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??\"\n\nMe: *Awkward chuckle* \"I'd rather not say, but it's up there!\"\n\nHer: \"What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??\"\n\nMe: *Visibly annoyed* \"No, I just prefer not to say.\"\n\nHer: *Laughs in my face* \"You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!\"\n\nMe: \"You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.\"\n\nThen I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand \"salary talk\". I think she's old enough.
