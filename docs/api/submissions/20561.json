Maybe once every 4-6 months if we are lucky. It's okay, as this is the life we signed up for. Well, Mother's Day, Father's Day and her birthday all just passed recently (we weren't able to do anything for any of it) and my birthday is only a couple weeks away so I wanted to plan a special weekend getaway for my wife and I. Boating and camping at our camp (we love it) so I've been looking for reliable and trustworthy sitters (family). \n\nMy sister said she would watch our kids. She has in the past and it's never been issue or anything, so I ran it by my wife first to actually make sure this was okay with her. She said that was fine. We were due to drop the kids off on Friday evening, but when we got here to drop the kids off, my sister had been called in to work and she told us that her husband (my BIL of 14 years) would watch them. My wife looked immediately uneasy and said \"no thank you, we appreciate it though\". I didn't even question it but my sister caused a scene about it. She was clearly overtired (she works way too many hours) but she says something like \"why not? My husband is perfectly fine to watch your kids. We have kids so why don't you trust him to watch yours?\". All my wife said was \"I'm not comfortable so no, thank you\" and we left. I've gotten some nasty texts from my sister regarding the issue. \n\nBut here's the thing.. my wife's intuition has never been wrong. She can sense things. Like she knew her uncle was dead hours before we got the call. The ONE time I convinced her that it was just anxiety, our son ended up with a broken arm (pool accident while he was with his friends). She had a bad feeling and didn't want to send him and I convinced her to let it happen and turns out she was right. We both feel bad because we essentially just made out like my BIL isn't trust worthy but again, my wife's intuition has never been wrong and she openly told me that something didn't \"feel right\".

She could just as easily be feeling he's not responsible enough to watch the kids on his own.", "It can be. It's often family that are sex offenders. Also, she could see that the sister is more than fine & pays attention. I wouldn't leave my kid with my BIL alone either. Why? Because at every family outing, he sits on his ass not looking at his kids at all. Sister does everything. Imagine if he has to babysit mine. Kid will be in India before he notices.", "So wife\u2019s intuition says BIL is going to do something wrong but sister\u2019s intuition says husband isn\u2019t going to do something wrong. Do you see the problem there? All these crazy people saying woman\u2019s intuition is never wrong but then you have two different women who have two opposite intuition feelings meaning by default one of them has to be wrong", "Why not? People believe in gods, religions , lots of weird stuff.", "If you are saying your intuition is right 1 out of 20 times, that\u2019s not intuition, that\u2019s luck of the draw.\n\nThe Gift of Fear is about being able to identify when antagonistic actions can occur and can potentially lead to violence. It is definitely not about cancelling plans because you got lucky 1 out of 20 times.", "What about 1/20,000?", "Gavin de Becker said in The Gift of Fear not to ignore your gut feelings on something like this.", "Again, I never said they should leave the kids with this couple. I\u2019m just saying the lack of an explanation comes across as very accusatory.", "Do you put your kids in daycare?", "\u201cHey we think your husband is a potential predator or possibly just completely negligent. Can you both babysit this weekend? Just\u2026 keep an eye on him, ok? Ha ha ha.\u201d", "A mother being uneasy doesn\u2019t mean something isn\u2019t right. Mothers aren\u2019t psychic. What an astronomically stupid thing to say.", "Ah, so when a mother has bad tummy feels about dungeons and dragons or rock and roll or gay people, it\u2019s totally fine? \n\nCome on.", "It\u2019s not that her intuition has never been wrong, it\u2019s just that people only tend to only remember when their intuition is correct.", "You\u2019re saying she predicted somebody\u2019s death", "Yes you did. You said multiple times she predicted the future lol. \n\nThat being said, I think everyone would agree that if you get a bad gut feeling from someone, you should at least reconsider. Especially when it comes to your children.", "Distinction without a difference. You both sound like obnoxious asshole. Your wife can't predict jack shit, you just only remember the times she happened to be mostly right, and forget the many more times she was wrong.", "Bullshit, I don\u2019t believe that for a second.", "Same dif... you are putting a \"gut\" reaction above facts... in the immortal words of Ricky Ricardo \"Lucy you gots some splaining to do\"... your wife better spit  out what is bothering her since you now have a major problem in the family... usually, when you hear \"I don't feel comfortable with that person\" without an explanation, it is due to someone knowing they are a predator or an abuser.  So which is it?\n\nBut notice she has canceled plans for the last year.. something is going on with your wife", "Yeah, I don\u2019t believe in psychics, thanks.", "lolwat", "They\u2019re talking about predicting the future!", "Another commenter said it best \u201cmaybe it\u2019s just as simple as she\u2019s noticed he pays more attention to the Xbox then what the kids are doing\u201d paraphrased , but still it\u2019s a valid point", "If my sister asks me to babysit, then I do it 100%. Not my partner. Sometimes, I see other people being on their phone so much or letting their wife do everything kid wise.", "Unless they have any evidence for any of that, however, the wife\u2019s intuition is essentially making that accusation. \n\nIf they have evidence of any of that sort of behavior, then it\u2019s very strange that OP has only ascribed it to her intuition here, without mentioning any other issues they\u2019ve witnessed. \n\nTo me, it seems like they\u2019re jumping at shadows, and I\u2019m guessing that related to why they get so few breaks from the kids.", "I mean, sure, maybe that's what happened, but then why wouldn't OP have put those concerns in the post. She obviously could tell him what bothered her. Instead, he listed some premonitions.", "People have sadly been conditioned by society to be \u201cpolite\u201d and not to trust their intuition, which is actually just information they are subconsciously noticing.", "I agree and also if she thought the BIL wasnt trustworthy why would she have left them with her sister in the first place.Seems odd.", "Maybe so, but no is an entire sentence. In my experience (which is by no means universal, I know), trying to explain \u201cno\u201d seems to make people think that it\u2019s open for discussion/debate/negotiation/whatever, rather than my trying to be courteous by offering an explanation.", "Well, 33 years of marriage has taught me to heed the wife's intuition. It is too frequently right.", "Whatever your personal risk assessment tells you is right. And however much you value whatever is at risk. To me 1/20000 isn\u2019t good enough to base anything on. It isn\u2019t particularly realistic either, you are bound to be correct much more than that.", "Yeah well that\u2019s just how it is. Lots of people would leave their kids with someone they feel uncomfortable with because they are too chicken about \u201coffending\u201d someone. I personally don\u2019t give a sh*t. My kids safety comes first. As a parent it\u2019s your job is to protect your kids and sometimes that isn\u2019t easy. Good for OP and their wife for putting their kids first.", "You speak sense! Why are you here?", "My youngest went to private nursery (like daycare) 2 half days a week, and was with grandma the rest of the time. I toured 6 nurseries and two I immediately said \u201cno I don\u2019t like this, I have a bad feeling\u201d. One of those was closed down 2 years for children escaping out onto a busy street, and then the  owner injuring a child in anger (they went to prison). The other was closed down after a child was given food that was too large for their age, left unattended and they sadly choked to death. \n\nI definitely noticed something wasn\u2019t right at both. I couldn\u2019t put it all into words though, other than I got an off/unhappy feeling from staff. But it was more than that. I was glad I trusted my gut though.\n\n(And if I had had any bad feelings or concerns about the one I picked after the fact I\u2019d have pulled them out of there too.)", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m not a psychic.

But you should definitely give some kind of an explanation if you don\u2019t want to offend them.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that \u201cgut feeling\u201d would be acceptable lol.", "After 14 years with no reason to assume ill intent", "I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re not psychic. I\u2019m sorry for your loss but that was a coincidence.", "So you\u2019ve been pessimistic and made some lucky guesses. Got it!", "Well she's going to have to learn to try if she ever wants to have a cordial relationship with OP's sister, because from her PoV, she was just told her husband is a danger to children, with no explanation.", "I didn\u2019t see an accusation, just a no thanks", "\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with this\u201d for something that has just been sprung on you last minute is a completely acceptable reason to give.", "You say you aren\u2019t saying they should leave their kids with the guy but everything else you say sounds like you think they should. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how long she\u2019s known him. (In fact, if anything, knowing him longer probably makes her feelings more accurate!) Something subconsciously has made her feel this situation isn\u2019t right. She should definitely pay attention to that.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel right about something talking yourself out of it by saying \u201coh I\u2019m just being silly\u201d or not wanting to offend is the worst thing you can do. There\u2019s lots of expert psychological info out there, as well as child protection sources, about this.

Not if you ever want the wife to babysit the kids in the future. And again, it doesn\u2019t make sense to trust one and not the other.", "Yeah I was thinking maybe the wife witnessed BIL watch his kids while being on Xbox so her gut is telling her he ain\u2019t gonna make a good babysitter. It\u2019s just that she didn\u2019t put it in words.", "I\u2019m saying that OP should talk to his wife and find out why she\u2019s so adamant. I\u2019m saying he needs to offer a better explanation to his sister or she\u2019ll probably never talk to him again. \n\nI\u2019m saying this whole situation is a mess.", "I would hope she would have mentioned it sooner.", "I read about as much as I could take without getting a migraine. My intuition told me I could spend my time better", "If you aren\u2019t comfortable with them yes it is totally acceptable. It was totally just sprung on them when they got there. The sister could have phoned them before they got there, even if they were driving over, to see if it was ok. Everyone has phones nowadays.\n\nAnd it could be something as simple as she could have noticed before the brother-in-law ignores safety stuff, which she wouldn\u2019t worry so much about with the sister in charge, but on his own it could be a big problem. Or maybe one of the kids has a bad food allergy, and he\u2019s made disparaging comments about it being \u201csilly\u201d or people \u201cfaking\u201d in the past. It could be other behavior that she has subconsciously picked up on. There are so many legitimate reasons that she might feel it\u2019s not right that she can\u2019t suddenly put into words when unexpectedly having this pushed on her.\n\nYeah maybe the sister won\u2019t want to babysit anymore but that\u2019s not a reason to just ignore it all.", "\"No,\" is a full sentence. \"I'm not comfortable with it,\" is a full sentence as well. There are several women I'd trust my son with while never trusting their husbands. Including my own brother's ex-wife, when she was married to him.

Ultimately, the parents get to decide.\n\nMY point is that it is certainly going to come across as offensive to the couple, especially when the sister has been watching the kids for years.\n\nOP should have agreed to it, and then figured out an excuse with his wife.", "Either give an explanation to the sister and to you or don't ever have a good relationship again... plain and simple... it is insulting... you don't feel comfortable- ok your choice... but I won't ever feel \"comfortable\" around you again...", "Sounds more like an uneducated guess.", "Do you know how Reddit works?", "They turned up at the house and had it sprung on them. They couldn\u2019t agree to it then think up an excuse later. \n\nIntuition is just stuff you\u2019ve subconsciously noticed and can\u2019t put into words.
