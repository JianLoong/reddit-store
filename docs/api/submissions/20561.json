Maybe once every 4-6 months if we are lucky. It's okay, as this is the life we signed up for. Well, Mother's Day, Father's Day and her birthday all just passed recently (we weren't able to do anything for any of it) and my birthday is only a couple weeks away so I wanted to plan a special weekend getaway for my wife and I. Boating and camping at our camp (we love it) so I've been looking for reliable and trustworthy sitters (family). \n\nMy sister said she would watch our kids. She has in the past and it's never been issue or anything, so I ran it by my wife first to actually make sure this was okay with her. She said that was fine. We were due to drop the kids off on Friday evening, but when we got here to drop the kids off, my sister had been called in to work and she told us that her husband (my BIL of 14 years) would watch them. My wife looked immediately uneasy and said \"no thank you, we appreciate it though\". I didn't even question it but my sister caused a scene about it. She was clearly overtired (she works way too many hours) but she says something like \"why not? My husband is perfectly fine to watch your kids. We have kids so why don't you trust him to watch yours?\". All my wife said was \"I'm not comfortable so no, thank you\" and we left. I've gotten some nasty texts from my sister regarding the issue. \n\nBut here's the thing.. my wife's intuition has never been wrong. She can sense things. Like she knew her uncle was dead hours before we got the call. The ONE time I convinced her that it was just anxiety, our son ended up with a broken arm (pool accident while he was with his friends). She had a bad feeling and didn't want to send him and I convinced her to let it happen and turns out she was right. We both feel bad because we essentially just made out like my BIL isn't trust worthy but again, my wife's intuition has never been wrong and she openly told me that something didn't \"feel right\".
