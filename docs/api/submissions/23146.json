I got angry and told her that it would be so much easier for me to lose weight if she would stop pestering me so often every day (yes, every conversation is about my weight. I can never talk to her about anything). She then started screaming that if she didn't \u2018\u2018remind me\u2018\u2018 I wouldn't care to do it. \"You even got ice cream yesterday at dinner!
