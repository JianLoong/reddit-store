You had every tight to be angry", "NTA.", "Your reaction seems a little excessive given than it turned out he was only away for a short while and you were waiting only 5-10 minutes.\n\nYes he was the AH for attaching to your bike rather than to railings. But your reaction was also unnecessarily aggressive for the situation.\n\nEditing to remove judgement since I had no idea this is a thing that bicycle thieves do.", "Bike thieves have been known to do this, so they can immobilize a bike until they can het tools to steal it.", "If a bike is locked to your bike it's almost always a bike thieve trying to fix your bike in position so they can steal it.\n\nBerlin has a massive bicycle theft problem. 25,000 bikes a year. More than Hamburg and Leipzig combined.", "His bike has the local guy's bike attached to it with the local guy's lock that OP didn't have the key for. How would he have done this?", "As other commenters have said, this is a known tactic for bike thieves.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Dude was going to steal it.", "NTA at all, coming from the bicycle country in the world, this is NOT done, you only ever chain a bike together with people you are out with, the dude made zero sense, its no different from intentionally blocking in a car \n\nYou had no way of knowing how long it would take, the entire hing is just ridiculous", "Nta, but next time use better \"Berliner Schnauze\" and that will solidify you as the Alpha in these kinds of situations.", ">\"Just have a beer.\u201d\n\nPerhaps he had already had many beers, which had impaired his judgement.", "Also it's not normal for Berlin.\nExcept for when he's trying to steal from you.", "He was planning on stealing OP's bike 100%", "Dude was trying to steal OPs bike", "The only reason strangers lock their bikes to another bike is if they're planning on stealing that other bike. OP reacted appropriately to a potential thief.", "Berlin's population is more than Hamburg and Leipzig combined so that's exactly what I'd expect.", "Have a second chain and lock, loop it through AH's bike body and wheel, lock it, tell him if he wants you to unlock it he'll have to unlock your bike from his, when he unlocks yours from his say \"welcome to Berlin\" and ride away.", "Really? Then this is something I'm wholly unaware of. I'll bow out.", "Absolutely NTA, this is not normal in Berlin, and as others mentioned below he probably just wanted to steal your bike. My question would be what was the location where you locked your bike? In Xberg or Neukolln this is unfortunately something that happens often.", "NTA - He was the TA and then literally tried to make you think you are wrong car calling him out. No it is not ok to attach ones bike to somebody elses. Not in Berlin nor Paris, nowhere in the world.", "NTA\n\nFuck that guy, I'd have looked for something to bash his bike to pieces and free mine.", "NTA - if you had not been there when he returned most likely the bike would have been gone", "NTA - but he definitely was.", "If someone is doing something weird or shady and then starts trying to use social engineering to calm you down or the we're in public/this is normal spiel, they're trying to rip you off. NTA.", "NTA. He's a bike thief. It's a tactic used by thieving trash.", "NTA. That's a fairly common tactic of bike thieves. \n\nFind the bike they want to steal (yours). Tether their bike to yours so it's not going anywhere. Leave to source the tools needed to break your specific bike lock + an extra rider. Return, break the lock and ride away. \n\nHe was counting on you not being around for a longer amount of time.", "The Netherlands?", "It was at Friedrichshain but sounds like I dodged a bullet here..", "Yep. Chain it then come back at night for both bikes.", "NTA At the very least he restricted your movement. By chaining your bike he was in effect chaining you to that area at his pleasure.", "NTA OP.", "NTA\n\nThat was not a coincidence", "NTA - coming from a bike-loving city, that\u2019s not normal. Sounds like bike-thief.", "NTA.   He impeded your right to travel, which is an act of aggression.  You would have been fully within your rights to separate the bikes by taking a saw to his lock, or his bike, whichever was easier to do.", "NTA - this guy is a bike thief and a terrible gas lighter", "Nta germans are famous for bike stealing", "First thought  i Had when Reading xD", "Also in Berlin you have to look out for tape on bike racks outside U/S stops or supermarkets.\n\nThey cut the metal and cover it in loads of tape so they can remove locked bikes. The \"accidentally\" locking your bike is normally also part of it.", "Yep", "NTA, who the hell chains their bike to someone else\u2019s?", "NTA. The other guy was a total A.", "NTA...but he sure is.", "NTA  \n\n\nThat's so freaking rude of that guy. Wouldn't be surprised if he also tried to steal your bike.", "NTA. Nobody should ever attach their bike to yours unless they have bad intentions.", "YTA\n\nThanks for helping paint a shit portrait of everyone from your country.\n\nOnce the other person got there and unlocked your bike, the situation was over...and you had to blow up at them?", "First of all, love all the people who just assume the worst.\n\nSecond of all, once the guy arrived, the situation was over. There is no need to continue to be pissed off once you get what you wanted.", "lol nearly everywhere I park Im parked behind another car, or another car parks behind me.  Did you mean you dont park too close?", "Either not being around or giving up and coming tomorrow, hoping for the lock to be gone... and instead the whole bike would also be gone. Whichever way, the bike would be his.", "You live and you learn... no worries", "Yup, asked my cousin in Berlin if this was actually a thing and she said \"Only if they're trying to steal it!\".", "Yes he was. There's no other reason for doing this. The guy just didn't have his \"tools\" on him, so he had to secure the bike while he went to get them.", "no reasonable person would attach their bike to someone else's", "I'm still later than I needed to be because an AH chained his bike to mine. The situation isn't over, I need to make up for lost time from waiting around to get this sorted, plus the time it takes me to kick his wheel until it breaks.", "I think they meant it to be about blocking them whilst parking.", "I meant boxing someone into their spot when they\u2019re in a parking lot. Obvs not the same when you parallel park, didn\u2019t think I needed to specifically explain given the context of the original post.", "Literally blocking another car in so they can't pull out.", "NTA", "He sounds dumb af NTA", "Mfker ida been pissed too! Like excuse me this is my bike too now tf. \ud83e\udd23", "\"Ich bin ein asshole\"", "He was the asshole, not you.", "Nta", "NTA Chain your bike to mine, I have an extra free bike", "why the fuck was he even attaching his bike to yours??? is he that drunk in the daytime already??? NTA", "Nta he locked up YOUR bike. Wtf?", "Yeah I've never been to Berlin specifically but I've found Germans to be extremely compliant with rules and processes (such as bike locking ettiquette) and very unlikely to inconvenience a stranger then tell them off for being upset."]}
