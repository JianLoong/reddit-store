(\"Actions speak louder than words\" and all that...)  The fact is, world is absolutely full of assholes and he is one of them. I think he may even feel deeply ashamed and traumatized by what happened and kinda hates you for being the hero of that story, when he was the victim. HE wants to be the hero. \n\nDon't worry. You won;t have to put up with him for too long - one day you will change schools and this will just be another bully to forget about and go on with your life.Just a stupid, clumsy kid who can;t be nice, so they are a \\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nYou helped another human being in distress. You did everything right. You are awesome.", "Idk man, my inner child that was bullied says fuck him. He\u2019s ungrateful and cruel. You are kind and helpful. Perhaps you shouldn\u2019t stoop to his level but standing up for yourself is important too. I think it\u2019s important to remember that people like him are usually hiding some pain. Whether it\u2019s his home life that\u2019s hurting him, insecurities of his own, he\u2019s acting out because there\u2019s something not right. And unfortunately you\u2019re the one he\u2019s aiming his outbursts at. NTA for what you said, this guy is a piece of work.", "NTA\n\nHelping your worst enemy (he made himself to you that) is the biggest strength of character a person has. You have done them a service and while you were not expecting it aloud, as in telling other people that you expected an apology or a thank you or something, you did expect it in your mind, which he didn't honor. Now the thing is that you had received admiration from your school. You don't need to earn his admiration, screw him. You're not in the wrong for telling him that he should be grateful when he hasn't been acting grateful. His friends can also screw off, as they're just his mouthpieces.", "NTA, you were pushed to a point even though you were kind. The friends should be more empathetic towards you, words weigh less then actions. You actions show you being kind, while the guy is shown to be ungrateful and scummy.", "NTA.  Saying I wish you had suffered much longer because you are a piece of excrement isn't probably the nicest thing to say, but sometimes it is appropriate.  Contact the school administration and let them know about the ongoing harassment.  It is not acceptable.", "NTA \n\nHe sounds miserable. I am appalled that he threw out your jacket. \n\nEveryone has a breaking point. It sounds like he pushed you to yours.", "NTA, it wasn't a great thing to say and you already seem to know that. It is also important for you to stand up for yourself. Have you spoken with anyone about this ongoing harassment? It's a little ridiculous that your school can give you attention for helping him but not help you avoid this campaign of bullying", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He worries that he would not. You are a better person and he knows that.", "It might be time to go around them to a school counselor or administrator. Maybe your parents or another family member could help you talk with them about it?", "Thank you - I\u2019ve spoken with my parents about this situation originally when it happened and we were planning to do this. Since this harassment hasn\u2019t stopped since this incident i will bring it up with them and i will definitely go to a administrator or a counsellor at my school :)", "Good, I'm so glad you have a good plan. Good luck! You deserve a break from this nonsense."]}
