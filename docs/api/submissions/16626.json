My brother has a prestigious high paying software job, and lives a great life. He did well in college and got a bachelor and master degree in computer science. And my sister is actively involved in a bunch of clubs at school, got gymnastics and piano awards, does well academically, and is going to work at a restaurant over the summer. But I struggled last year, and my GPA dropped from like 3.8 to 3.6. My major is architecture and it's just that the studios are so long and hard, plus I had a tough time in physics. I didn't get any summer internships, so I'm taking summer classes.\n\nThis summer I'll be commuting to school 3 days a week, so that requires gas, parking, and insurance, which my parents helped pay for. But it costs a good deal of money, so they aren't too happy about it. Also, because of my classes I won't be able to help around much at home with chores, other family members will have to do more chores inevitably. My parents already talk about that themselves, and when I overhear their conversation they talk about how I'm a burden who does nothing useful.\n\nEarlier today my parents were saying how I should be like my brother who excelled in college and makes 6 figures. I said that I'm trying my hardest, and that some classes like physics or certain architecture courses are very difficult. Often I spend entire days in studio and thus didn't really have a social life. They pointed out that my sister is very social and still does well academically, and even got a summer job. I felt really bad and told them that internships are hard to come by and that recruiters prefer 3rd years and up over 1st and 2nd years. Then my dad said that my brother got internships starting his second year, because he is smarter and more hard working than me. That made me really mad so I said that I do work very hard, and that intelligence is partially genetic. Both my parents got mad at me, and told me to be more like my siblings. I couldn't contain it any more so I screamed that I am not the black sheep of the family, and that they need to stop treating me as such. I told them I don't appreciate being called a burden, and that everyone goes at their own pace. However my mom said that I asked to be treated like this because I didn't work hard enough in school (which I did, despite being in a brutal major).\n\nI stopped talking to my parents after this incident (about 2 hours ago), and I just isolated myself to my room crying.", "created_utc": 1683472233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13aso17/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_im_not_the_black/", "score": 371, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Way to put wedges in their relationship, and to destroy someone's self-esteem. So counter productive if you want your child to succeed in life. I guess intelligence is not that genetic, because your parents don't sound smart at all.\n\nAlso, someone doing good academically is not necessarily smart. I know enough dumbs doctors or engineers to prove this point.\n\nEta: hang in there. Few years and you're independent.", "NTA for defending yourself.\n\nAlso are you happy with your major? Studio is hard, and it won't get easier when you graduate. If you don't love the grind, maybe think about changing things up. I started as an architecture major and changed to Construction Management. Been doing it for almost 20 years and love it. No need for grad school, money is decent, but it is very stressful. Food for thought.", "NTA. You know who the assholes are? Your parents. \n\nYou ARE smart. You are worthy. You probably have an awesome personality too, and I can see how down to earth you are. Your parents are absolute dicks for not being proud of you. They value their children over superficial and trivial shit. I couldn't give a fuck how much money someone makes. Your parents care about shit no one that you matter to will ever care about.", "Parents should never compare siblings, it is cruel an often ruins relationships.", "NTA. You are struggling with your course load and your parents don't know how to help you. They are low in emotional intelligence and their solution, when you're down, is to kick you harder.\n\nIs there any way to take public transit to reduce the pressure on your parents? Could you talk to an advisor and find out if there are dorms available at least for the summer?", "NTA. They may not think you're the black sheep, but they're certainly not being supportive the way they should be.\n\nlets see...\n\nYour grades. ok. They slipped a little. Not the end of the world. If nobody else has told you, I will... A 3.6 is still a very respectable GPA.\n\nAnd yes, physics can be tough. I know. My Bachelors is in physics. And with only a passing familiarity with architecture, I have no trouble understanding that it's tough too. You're learning to design buildings. I'd be a little horrified if the training wasn't rigorous and challenging. Props to you for aiming high.\n\nInternship. Only passing familiar with architecture, but work in tech. Not a programmer myself, but I work with them. Also knew multiple CS majors in school. Even then your statement that internships in your field aren't generally available until after completing the junior year was sensible.\n\nWith CS, I can easily see a lot of offices being able to find things for an intern that's only conpleted their sophmore year to do. In my own office, they'd probably just pick a low priority feature request and let the intern at it. If the resulting code was usable, great. They'ld still have one of the regular engineers review it and polish it.  If not, oh well. It's not like we haven't had code projects that got scrapped before. It happens.\n\nOther fields, naw. Sophmores ain't learned enough yet to be usable as an intern or for an internship to be beneficial to them. Comes as no surprise that architecture would be one of them.\n\nChores & costs. Uhm... do they realize that even if you'd gotten an internship, it would have impacted your availability to do chores. And depending on the firm and their expectations for interns, possibly more than taking summer classes will.\n\nSame thing with costs. Not all internships pay. Or if they do pay, they may pay a pittance. No guarantee you wouldn't need help money-wise, even with an internship.\n\nSummer classes. You are taking a sensible course of action to help ensure that you will graduate on time, if not early. You're in the process of developing yourself into an independent adult who will be able to be self-supporting. This does not happen instantly.\n\nIn order to do that, it can, and often times does, mean making choices about how you spend your time that prioritize progress towards your career over your family. \n\nBesides. Can almost guarantee the cost of those summer classes is less than the cost of taking them during the regular school year. If taking these classes can cut even one term off your senior year, it will be a net benefit.\n\nSocial life. Love that they're trying to compare your sister's social life as a junior in HS to yours as a college sophmore. Like hello. That's as may be, it's still a frog.\n\nAnd frankly, as a parent, I'd be less concerned about whether you have a social life and more concerned about whether you were overworking yourself and heading to burnout.\n\nSerious question. Are you more introverted than others in your family? Comparing your sistees social life to yours gives a certain level of introvert in a house of extroverts feel.\n\nThat they may be complaining ultimately because you do not fit into their mindset of life and they would rather find fault than appreciate you for who you are.\n\nIn any case, they are clearly more focused on how you can help them now in the short term than on how they can help you be successful in the long run.\n\nAs a parent of teens not much younger than your sister myself, I know I would always rather my focus be on how I can help them to become successful and independent. Even if it takes longer than I might want it to.", "Some of the smartest people I know never went to college.  Doing well in college doesn't mean one will do well in life.  \n\nRichard Branson dropped out of school and later founded Virgin Records. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard and later found in microsoft. Many successful people struggled at school. \n\nYour parents comparing you to your siblings is unfair, toxic, and useless.  Use it to motivate yourself to succeed.  Network as much as you can. Focus on your strengths and how you can use them to succeed.", "OP you are your own person and deserve to be treated as such. I got an internship my first year, but do you know what that should mean? Absolutely nothing to you. Everyone else\u2019s achievements don\u2019t define you. You have a 3.6 GPA and you are killing it! My GPA was a 2.9 when I graduated so that should show you how much that first internship really benefited me lol.

If you are happy and ultimately going to end up in a place where you feel like YOU are successful that's all that matters . It is wrong of them to compare you and treat you as inferior , from your post you aren't some lazy dropout just not as perhaps over achieving as your siblings. My grandma is the same as your parents - likes to brag about her grandchildrens achievements (my cousin became a lawyer but later quit because he hated it but its all we heard about) and all she talks about is his 'wonderful ex girlfriend who she adored because she came from a wealthy family. I'm not so Impressive to her because I don't have a degree and don't have a job she can brag about (I work for the infection control and cleaning department of a local busy hospital) but I did point out to her that one - I'm actually financially comfortable and two I'm the only one of the grandchildren that is doing a job that helps keep a hospital up and running and helping to keep patients free from nasty bugs and infections (She did shut up then).\n\nIt's OK for parents and family to be proud of you that's wonderful but so they can compare you to others and use it to make your feel inferior is not OK. They are creating unnecessary wedges between you and your siblings and impacting your mental health.", "NTA You stood up for yourself. That's good. \n\nSide note: You aren't less intelligent than your siblings. Intelligence is not so easily quantifiable and just because they're having an easier time at these specific things.

You're too old to be throwing temper tantrums and for not being able to recognize your own shortcomings.

If this isn't what you want to be doing with your life, then don't do it. But if it is, sorry, you kinda need to deal.\n\nThat said, if they're offering to help you they shouldn't be calling you a burden. Edit to clarify: I said ESH because your parents are clearly in the wrong. They shouldn't be talking to you that way. \n\nTbh, you're leaching a bit more than you need to. there's no reason you can't take 20 minutes to help with chores. If your classes are 3 days a week, there's no reason you can't get a part time job to pay for the gas. There are studies that show contributing to the household helps with mental health.", "YTA. \n\nNobody called you the black sheep, and even if they did, I\u2019m not sure what you think declaring yourself not to be the black sheep would do. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason why a full-time college student without a job can\u2019t contribute to household chores or have a part time job to pay for their own gas.   \n\nIf you are spending 80+ hours a week working in your undergrad degree, I would consider a different degree that would allow you to contribute to your household and take on more of your own living expenses.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They would rather you speak up than struggle in silence.", "Wow. This is brutal. Hang in there. Wish you could live on campus so you didn\u2019t have to hear their comments.  They are emotionally abusive. Once you get your degree, move far far away.", "NTA\n\nWhat on earth is wrong with your parents? It sounds like you are doing great. As a parent, an educator, and a former college student I salute you. Do your best to ignore them and keep on doing your best. If dorm housing is an option consider it to get away from the stress.", "Absolutely NTA. Your parents are clueless assholes.\n\nArchitecture is hard! The fact that your GPA is as good as it is is great! That's a score to be proud of for sure.\n\nIt sucks when family isn't supportive. You deserve better than how they're treating you. I hope you're able to curate support among your peers because we all need it from somewhere.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing. You're doing great. And when you're out of that environment and settled elsewhere, you can limit contact with your unsupportive parents. It will probably do wonders for your mental health.", "NTA and I'm so sorry that your parents are doing this to you. I never had siblings but my parents still constantly compared me to literally anyone they could, especially my grades or the fact that I didn't go to uni after high school, etc so honestly, I feel for you.\n\nYou are doing your best and your field is very, VERY different from your brothers. Also, I'm not sure your parents noticed but getting jobs and internships in any country is extremely harder now that in previous years. In my country, most companies only hire people who are about to finish their degree so honestly, your brother probably had very lucky timing too.\n\nDo your best to distance yourself from them if you can and do not believe all the bs they tell you about you not working hard enough.", "NTA - architecture is not computer science. You are not your brother. The only success in life is not how well or quickly you graduate college or what your average GPA is at any given time. Nor is it fair to judge your trajectory when it\u2019s unknown. Screw them.", "NTA. Your parents shouldn't be comparing you to your siblings. So sorry they're treating you that way.", "NTA your parents are. As a parent you should build up your kids and support them. \n\nAs a child I sailed through spelling and reading, my brother struggled and my parents always bigged up efforts as much as outcomes so he never felt low and never made me seem better then him.", "You need to accept that you will ever feel truly  loved and accepted by your parents. No matter what you do or what you accomplish, they will always make you feel bad. Accept it and keep the peace so that they continue to find your schooling. Don\u2019t expect anything more from them because they are not capable of giving it. NTA", "Ouch - this hit me right in the feels. All my life I struggled with school, especially math. I still struggle with some things today. My mother and sister are like human computers, and excel at everything needed to be awesome students. They could never understand why I \"just don't get it.\" They never suffered with that. Now that I am in my fifties, I can appreciate that I have other qualities that my sister does not have, but that took a long time. I got those same lectures from my mom, but my dad, who also was a better student of \"life,\" like me, understood why I struggled. I'm sorry you have to go through this. I can only suggest to stick to what you love, because that's where you'll ultimately succeed. Absolutely NTA. This, too, shall pass. (Though it's going to suck some until it does.) Hugs from a former struggling student!", "NTA. Theyre being awful\n\nInternship opportunities are different depending on your major anyway. There's going to be a lot more people willing to take in interns for computer science than architecture.", "You'd think your parents would be patting themselves on the back for raising three superstar kids but no. I swear no one is ever happy. NTA. The hell with them. I think you're doing amazing. Physics is hard. \n\nYou have an A average! \n\nYes, you are terrible not already having a full time job and three masters degrees at age twenty. /s", "NTA. I have a BS in Arch and I would've killed for a 3.6 GPA. I graduated with a 3.0 lol. Architecture is fucking HARD and GRUELING for a major and you're expected to pull all nighters all the time. It's not a major that has a good work/life balance. I found it gets better once you graduate and get a job, especially if you set your boundaries early and often.", "NTA. /u/OlympiaNews543\n\nOP, I know how hard it is to be compared to siblings, your parent's friend's kids, etc. It's damning. I am 31 years old and still dealing with some of the mental and emotional damage my parents did to me in this very way. It led to me breaking down, giving up on school, and tanking my gpa in the process, among other consequences. Two years ago this September I finally went no contact with them. While that's not the right choice for everyone, it was for me. I'm finally, this year, beginning to rebuild. I've reenrolled in college, have a stable job that I love, and have the full support of my wife and two children. They constantly tell me how proud they are of me and lift me up. I want to pass some of that on to you. \n\nYou are so worthy of praise. Your gpa is phenomenal. You're working incredibly hard in an extremely challenging field. Please treat yourself with kindness and grace. You have so much more worth than your academic or professional accomplishments, but you also deserve praise for them. If your parents won't treat you with the kindness, love, and respect that you deserve then let us internet strangers be your honorary parents. You've done well, are still doing well, and only deserve the best. \n\nLove, \n\nYour Internet Mom \u2764", "NTA.  Your parents are completely CLUELESS about how different your area of study is.  Architecture means WEEKS of overnights in studio.  You do not have time for anything else.  \n\nI would ask- gently, if you have examined this as a career in the future?  I ask because I have a degree in Architecture- and unless things have changed SUBSTANTIALLY, you will need a Masters degree, and then work for more than a decade while you take really difficult tests before you can work independently. And you may not recall- but in 2007-9, when the world economy went bonkers?  Architects were the first to loose. I ended up not following that path, and ended up going through STEM to doctorate, and have been fine, and like what I learned form that time.  But of my friends that went into Architecture ( all of 3 out of dozens of classmates in my cohort and older)? They all, without exception, all in our 50-60s, say that while they are FINALLY getting some level of \"success\" (partnerships, etc), they regret following that path. And many more left Architecture somewhere along the way (I never went into it- I left the\"earliest\". \n\nYou are doing a VERY hard degree, that will not get easier over the next 2-3 yr to wrap up your BA- and you will need another 2-3 yr MA degree to be truly competitive on the job market. Now might be a good time to meet with a guidance counselor at your school, and see if this is the best path?  it is a very difficult career path, without a lot of financial payoff until you are much MUCH older. It comes with many rewards- but at very high costs- to your health, finances, and independence. Might be worth it, regardless. It was not for me.", "Comparison is the thief of joy\u2026.I am soo stealing that. My heart broke for OP. Like holy crap he has a 3.6 gpa and his parents aren\u2019t happy? He\u2019s the black sheep? Jesus, that poor kid.\n\nOP: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll read this but if you do, listen to this Mom. You are doing absolutely amazing. I am so proud of how hard you are working. 3.6 is an awesome GPA. Way better than I ever did in my bachelors. If there\u2019s a counselor at your college, try to set up an appointment. Burn out is a very real risk considering the pressure your parents are putting on you and having an unbiased ear to listen to you could be very beneficial. At worst, it\u2019s someone to vent to when your parents once more spew their crap about being like your siblings. Good luck and YOU ARE DOING AWESOME.", "My cousin started out in architecture but switched to Civil Engineering after his sophomore year when he got fed up with the way the professors taught design. He loved it, and made it his career. He's a few years older than me so he's probably been retired for a bit.", "If the parents didn't want to pay they should have said no before instead of signing op up and paying and then complaining after.", "I think OP has heart-disabled parents.", "Will you adopt me?", "I totally agree with you! Very well said. Wish I had an award to give you!\n\nThis mom also is super proud of you, OP. You are doing amazing. \n\nAlso, NTA.", "NTA. Theyre being awful"]}
