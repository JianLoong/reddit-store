My brother has a prestigious high paying software job, and lives a great life. He did well in college and got a bachelor and master degree in computer science. And my sister is actively involved in a bunch of clubs at school, got gymnastics and piano awards, does well academically, and is going to work at a restaurant over the summer. But I struggled last year, and my GPA dropped from like 3.8 to 3.6. My major is architecture and it's just that the studios are so long and hard, plus I had a tough time in physics. I didn't get any summer internships, so I'm taking summer classes.\n\nThis summer I'll be commuting to school 3 days a week, so that requires gas, parking, and insurance, which my parents helped pay for. But it costs a good deal of money, so they aren't too happy about it. Also, because of my classes I won't be able to help around much at home with chores, other family members will have to do more chores inevitably. My parents already talk about that themselves, and when I overhear their conversation they talk about how I'm a burden who does nothing useful.\n\nEarlier today my parents were saying how I should be like my brother who excelled in college and makes 6 figures. I said that I'm trying my hardest, and that some classes like physics or certain architecture courses are very difficult. Often I spend entire days in studio and thus didn't really have a social life. They pointed out that my sister is very social and still does well academically, and even got a summer job. I felt really bad and told them that internships are hard to come by and that recruiters prefer 3rd years and up over 1st and 2nd years. Then my dad said that my brother got internships starting his second year, because he is smarter and more hard working than me. That made me really mad so I said that I do work very hard, and that intelligence is partially genetic. Both my parents got mad at me, and told me to be more like my siblings. I couldn't contain it any more so I screamed that I am not the black sheep of the family, and that they need to stop treating me as such. I told them I don't appreciate being called a burden, and that everyone goes at their own pace. However my mom said that I asked to be treated like this because I didn't work hard enough in school (which I did, despite being in a brutal major).\n\nI stopped talking to my parents after this incident (about 2 hours ago), and I just isolated myself to my room crying.", "created_utc": 1683472233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13aso17/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_im_not_the_black/", "score": 961, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Way to put wedges in their relationship, and to destroy someone's self-esteem. So counter productive if you want your child to succeed in life. I guess intelligence is not that genetic, because your parents don't sound smart at all.\n\nAlso, someone doing good academically is not necessarily smart. I know enough dumbs doctors or engineers to prove this point.\n\nEta: hang in there. Few years and you're independent.", "NTA for defending yourself.\n\nAlso are you happy with your major? Studio is hard, and it won't get easier when you graduate. If you don't love the grind, maybe think about changing things up. I started as an architecture major and changed to Construction Management. Been doing it for almost 20 years and love it. No need for grad school, money is decent, but it is very stressful. Food for thought.", "NTA. You know who the assholes are? Your parents. \n\nYou ARE smart. You are worthy. You probably have an awesome personality too, and I can see how down to earth you are. Your parents are absolute dicks for not being proud of you. They value their children over superficial and trivial shit. I couldn't give a fuck how much money someone makes. Your parents care about shit no one that you matter to will ever care about.", "Parents should never compare siblings, it is cruel an often ruins relationships.", "NTA. You are struggling with your course load and your parents don't know how to help you. They are low in emotional intelligence and their solution, when you're down, is to kick you harder.\n\nIs there any way to take public transit to reduce the pressure on your parents? Could you talk to an advisor and find out if there are dorms available at least for the summer?", "NTA. They may not think you're the black sheep, but they're certainly not being supportive the way they should be.\n\nlets see...\n\nYour grades. ok. They slipped a little. Not the end of the world. If nobody else has told you, I will... A 3.6 is still a very respectable GPA.\n\nAnd yes, physics can be tough. I know. My Bachelors is in physics. And with only a passing familiarity with architecture, I have no trouble understanding that it's tough too. You're learning to design buildings. I'd be a little horrified if the training wasn't rigorous and challenging. Props to you for aiming high.\n\nInternship. Only passing familiar with architecture, but work in tech. Not a programmer myself, but I work with them. Also knew multiple CS majors in school. Even then your statement that internships in your field aren't generally available until after completing the junior year was sensible.\n\nWith CS, I can easily see a lot of offices being able to find things for an intern that's only conpleted their sophmore year to do. In my own office, they'd probably just pick a low priority feature request and let the intern at it. If the resulting code was usable, great. They'ld still have one of the regular engineers review it and polish it.  If not, oh well. It's not like we haven't had code projects that got scrapped before. It happens.\n\nOther fields, naw. Sophmores ain't learned enough yet to be usable as an intern or for an internship to be beneficial to them. Comes as no surprise that architecture would be one of them.\n\nChores & costs. Uhm... do they realize that even if you'd gotten an internship, it would have impacted your availability to do chores. And depending on the firm and their expectations for interns, possibly more than taking summer classes will.\n\nSame thing with costs. Not all internships pay. Or if they do pay, they may pay a pittance. No guarantee you wouldn't need help money-wise, even with an internship.\n\nSummer classes. You are taking a sensible course of action to help ensure that you will graduate on time, if not early. You're in the process of developing yourself into an independent adult who will be able to be self-supporting. This does not happen instantly.\n\nIn order to do that, it can, and often times does, mean making choices about how you spend your time that prioritize progress towards your career over your family. \n\nBesides. Can almost guarantee the cost of those summer classes is less than the cost of taking them during the regular school year. If taking these classes can cut even one term off your senior year, it will be a net benefit.\n\nSocial life. Love that they're trying to compare your sister's social life as a junior in HS to yours as a college sophmore. Like hello. That's as may be, it's still a frog.\n\nAnd frankly, as a parent, I'd be less concerned about whether you have a social life and more concerned about whether you were overworking yourself and heading to burnout.\n\nSerious question. Are you more introverted than others in your family? Comparing your sistees social life to yours gives a certain level of introvert in a house of extroverts feel.\n\nThat they may be complaining ultimately because you do not fit into their mindset of life and they would rather find fault than appreciate you for who you are.\n\nIn any case, they are clearly more focused on how you can help them now in the short term than on how they can help you be successful in the long run.\n\nAs a parent of teens not much younger than your sister myself, I know I would always rather my focus be on how I can help them to become successful and independent. Even if it takes longer than I might want it to.", "Some of the smartest people I know never went to college.  Doing well in college doesn't mean one will do well in life.  \n\nRichard Branson dropped out of school and later founded Virgin Records. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard and later found in microsoft. Many successful people struggled at school. \n\nYour parents comparing you to your siblings is unfair, toxic, and useless.  Use it to motivate yourself to succeed.  Network as much as you can. Focus on your strengths and how you can use them to succeed.", "OP you are your own person and deserve to be treated as such. I got an internship my first year, but do you know what that should mean? Absolutely nothing to you. Everyone else\u2019s achievements don\u2019t define you. You have a 3.6 GPA and you are killing it! My GPA was a 2.9 when I graduated so that should show you how much that first internship really benefited me lol.

If you are happy and ultimately going to end up in a place where you feel like YOU are successful that's all that matters . It is wrong of them to compare you and treat you as inferior , from your post you aren't some lazy dropout just not as perhaps over achieving as your siblings. My grandma is the same as your parents - likes to brag about her grandchildrens achievements (my cousin became a lawyer but later quit because he hated it but its all we heard about) and all she talks about is his 'wonderful ex girlfriend who she adored because she came from a wealthy family. I'm not so Impressive to her because I don't have a degree and don't have a job she can brag about (I work for the infection control and cleaning department of a local busy hospital) but I did point out to her that one - I'm actually financially comfortable and two I'm the only one of the grandchildren that is doing a job that helps keep a hospital up and running and helping to keep patients free from nasty bugs and infections (She did shut up then).\n\nIt's OK for parents and family to be proud of you that's wonderful but so they can compare you to others and use it to make your feel inferior is not OK. They are creating unnecessary wedges between you and your siblings and impacting your mental health.", "NTA You stood up for yourself. That's good. \n\nSide note: You aren't less intelligent than your siblings. Intelligence is not so easily quantifiable and just because they're having an easier time at these specific things.

You're too old to be throwing temper tantrums and for not being able to recognize your own shortcomings.

If this isn't what you want to be doing with your life, then don't do it. But if it is, sorry, you kinda need to deal.\n\nThat said, if they're offering to help you they shouldn't be calling you a burden. Edit to clarify: I said ESH because your parents are clearly in the wrong. They shouldn't be talking to you that way. \n\nTbh, you're leaching a bit more than you need to. there's no reason you can't take 20 minutes to help with chores. If your classes are 3 days a week, there's no reason you can't get a part time job to pay for the gas. There are studies that show contributing to the household helps with mental health.", "YTA. \n\nNobody called you the black sheep, and even if they did, I\u2019m not sure what you think declaring yourself not to be the black sheep would do. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason why a full-time college student without a job can\u2019t contribute to household chores or have a part time job to pay for their own gas.   \n\nIf you are spending 80+ hours a week working in your undergrad degree, I would consider a different degree that would allow you to contribute to your household and take on more of your own living expenses.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Having a GPA that high in such a demanding major is amazing. Your parents can fuck right off.", "NTA. As  practicing, licensed architect, I understand exactly how brutal undergrad studios are. 20+ hrs per day of studio time, sometimes days without any sleep, it's absolutely inhumane. And physics was an absolute beast.\n\nYou are correct internships are generally for 4th years, and masters candidates. Fortunately for you, I found the masters program much easier and less intense than undergrad. The profession is nothing like school.\n\nYour parents, unfortunately, seem to have no understanding of exactly how demanding this program is. I lived with a chemical engineer, mechanical engineers, electrical engineer, and a couple political science majors, and they all thought architecture was by far the more difficult path.\n\nHang in there, because it does get better!", "It\u2019s cruel for parents to\nOpenly compare their children to each other.

Between that, his part-time work, and his high-level sport, he isn't at home half the week, and when he is, he usually have a lot of study to do.\n\nRight now, he does almost no chores.  He just doesn't have time, and when he does, we don't mind if he chooses to game or relax because we recognise he is working very hard.  Our attitude is that because he works so hard, we make extra allowances for him.\n\nI am so sorry that your parents don't see it this way.  You, your brother and sister are all different people, and doing things that make different demands on you.  I am sorry they don't realise that you are in a very tough course.  Of course, your grades might drop a bit.  Your work is getting harder!

Look, I have been through architecture school. I\u2019m telling the literal and absolute truth when I share that on my first day of architecture school, we had to sign a contract agreeing to a standard of behaviors that we would follow in order to minimize stress on our fellow students. Things like walking on the right side of the hallway, when to hold the door open for the person behind you, who walks through a door first when going into or coming out of a building, etc. \n\nArchitecture school is HARD. Worst of all, the design classes are subjective, and god help you if your instructor didn\u2019t like your abstract interpretation of a building. \n\nAnd that\u2019s before getting into the physics and math classes you have to take. \n\nYour parents have no concept of just how hard your program is. It\u2019s stressful, and there were students in my program who were so depressed that they started hurting themselves. \n\nIf you show them any of these comments, show them mine. I had to drop out of the program and change my major because of how dangerously depressed I got, even though I was one of the very few selected to continue my studies. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s competitive, it was one of the darkest periods of my life.

My brother would sometimes be up until 4am working on his drafts while he was at school. When he came home during holidays, he\u2019d have to spend half the visit studying.

Yes, there will be debt but you won't owe anyone anything. You will have peace of mind, no more comparisons.

Any parent that calls their own child a burden should be stripped of any parental rights. The fact they see a young adult with a 3.6 gpa in an EXTREMELY difficult major as \"not working hard\" says quite a bit about them.

But I hate to be the one to tell you\u2026 you\u2019re definitely the black sheep of the family. Your parents have created a terrible culture in your household where they compare all their kids. The question is, did they get grades like this and are they making 6 figures each? Bc if not, they really need to lay off you. You know everyone is different and moves at their own pace so try not to let your parents negativity steer you down a whole. Your GPA is great and you\u2019re doing great! KEEP GOING!

Your grades aren't always a good indicator of your intelligence, work ethic, or ability to succeed.", "NTA. As a parent of two kids taking demanding courseloads at elite universities:  \n1. I'd expect your GPA to drop significantly while taking physics. That's absolutely typical and nothing to be ashamed of. (I also don't expect my kids to let me know their grades. Is it necessary for you to offer your parents that info given that they weaponize your perfectly respectable grades?)  \n2. It's bananas to think that different fields wouldn't have different practices re: internships.  \n3. Sounds smart to take summer classes. You strike me at motivated, which will serve you well in life.  \n4. I wouldn't expect my kids to be doing much in the way of chores while taking college classes. I'd want them to take their dishes to the kitchen when they are done with them, wipe off kitchen counters when they've made food, and do their own laundry.  \n5. Honestly, your parents sound kind of ignorant about the differences in workloads in different fields of study. When I was in college, my friends who had physics or architecture classes (or organic chemistry) seemed to have particularly brutal workloads and we didn't see them much. I imagine that's still the case today.  \n6. Hang in there until you're done with college, and please know that for most folks out here, it's obvious that you're doing really well for yourself and are setting yourself up for an excellent career.

I aced pretty much all my courses in university, EXCEPT accounting. I think I got something like a C+ for it, by far my worst grade in all 4 years of schooling.

Would it be alright if I PM'ed you?", "Oh my god, same! I made it through medical school just fine, but physics is absolutely beyond my comprehension. I\u2019m usually good at math (got an A in calculus the same semester that I barely pulled a B- in physics - and I only managed to do that well because of my lab partner, whose name I\u2019ve forgotten but who definitely did all the heavy lifting in that lab!), but I just could not apply it at all to the concepts. Fortunately, physics is actually not all that important for medicine (I honestly don\u2019t know why they want you to take it at all; unless you\u2019re actively building your own MRI machine, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s relevant).\n\nFor judgement: NTA, OP.

Didn't matter what it was, we just had to draw, woth the typical art values, ie lineweight, focus, shading. Every. Single. Day. 6x6 squares of cardstock, fill the page. I couldn't keep up, between all my other classes, the many hours in studio, and working at night. \nOur first assignment was thinly veiled origami, and that was the nail in the coffin. They wanted us to assemble folded papers into a mobile. How does that have to do with architecture? I want to design houses and buildings, not Eleanor Roosevelt's oriental drapes. \n\nThere's such a vast disconnect between architecture IRL and architecture in school, and that's the structure. \"Let the engineer figure it out\" doesn't work IRL, it leads to design failure.", "Thank you so much! \ud83e\udd72\ud83d\udc9a", "As the General Contractor, I frequently say \"everything is easy when it's lines on a piece of paper\". You say let the engineer figure it out. But just as frequently if not more it's \"call it delegated design and make the contractor figure it out\".\n\nI remember one project we had to draw the main architecture annex building. There is a flagstone breezeway. We expected to be able to figure out the patten, show it, and say typical as is normal. TA said no, draw it all. Our group was the only one that had to do it, and we were all there at 3 in the morning. This is all by hand mind you...\n\nAnother assignment was to build 6 simple models that defined 2 spaces. I was thinking like boxes or something... All I remember was I ran out ideas at 5 and said screw it. I took some newspaper, cut it up and made sticks out of it, then made string out of braiding it and threaded it around the sticks... I was sure I would fail for that.  It's what the professor liked best.\n\nI had to do charcoals. CHARCOALS. How many Architects draw in charcoal? I am not an artist, I can't charcoal to save my life. TA comments... \"Well your blacks sure are... Black\". Architecture school is absurd. All so you can graduate, go to grad school, run up debt, get out and work for peanuts under someone else's stamp for years. Or graduate from undergrad, no grad school needed, and get a job paying twice as much in construction."]}
