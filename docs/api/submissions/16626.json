My brother has a prestigious high paying software job, and lives a great life. He did well in college and got a bachelor and master degree in computer science. And my sister is actively involved in a bunch of clubs at school, got gymnastics and piano awards, does well academically, and is going to work at a restaurant over the summer. But I struggled last year, and my GPA dropped from like 3.8 to 3.6. My major is architecture and it's just that the studios are so long and hard, plus I had a tough time in physics. I didn't get any summer internships, so I'm taking summer classes.\n\nThis summer I'll be commuting to school 3 days a week, so that requires gas, parking, and insurance, which my parents helped pay for. But it costs a good deal of money, so they aren't too happy about it. Also, because of my classes I won't be able to help around much at home with chores, other family members will have to do more chores inevitably. My parents already talk about that themselves, and when I overhear their conversation they talk about how I'm a burden who does nothing useful.\n\nEarlier today my parents were saying how I should be like my brother who excelled in college and makes 6 figures. I said that I'm trying my hardest, and that some classes like physics or certain architecture courses are very difficult. Often I spend entire days in studio and thus didn't really have a social life. They pointed out that my sister is very social and still does well academically, and even got a summer job. I felt really bad and told them that internships are hard to come by and that recruiters prefer 3rd years and up over 1st and 2nd years. Then my dad said that my brother got internships starting his second year, because he is smarter and more hard working than me. That made me really mad so I said that I do work very hard, and that intelligence is partially genetic. Both my parents got mad at me, and told me to be more like my siblings. I couldn't contain it any more so I screamed that I am not the black sheep of the family, and that they need to stop treating me as such. I told them I don't appreciate being called a burden, and that everyone goes at their own pace.

Way to put wedges in their relationship, and to destroy someone's self-esteem. So counter productive if you want your child to succeed in life. I guess intelligence is not that genetic, because your parents don't sound smart at all.\n\nAlso, someone doing good academically is not necessarily smart. I know enough dumbs doctors or engineers to prove this point.\n\nEta: hang in there. Few years and you're independent.", "NTA for defending yourself.\n\nAlso are you happy with your major? Studio is hard, and it won't get easier when you graduate. If you don't love the grind, maybe think about changing things up. I started as an architecture major and changed to Construction Management. Been doing it for almost 20 years and love it. No need for grad school, money is decent, but it is very stressful. Food for thought.", "NTA. You know who the assholes are? Your parents. \n\nYou ARE smart. You are worthy. You probably have an awesome personality too, and I can see how down to earth you are. Your parents are absolute dicks for not being proud of you. They value their children over superficial and trivial shit. I couldn't give a fuck how much money someone makes. Your parents care about shit no one that you matter to will ever care about.", "Parents should never compare siblings, it is cruel an often ruins relationships.", "NTA. You are struggling with your course load and your parents don't know how to help you. They are low in emotional intelligence and their solution, when you're down, is to kick you harder.\n\nIs there any way to take public transit to reduce the pressure on your parents? Could you talk to an advisor and find out if there are dorms available at least for the summer?", "NTA. They may not think you're the black sheep, but they're certainly not being supportive the way they should be.\n\nlets see...\n\nYour grades. ok. They slipped a little. Not the end of the world. If nobody else has told you, I will... A 3.6 is still a very respectable GPA.\n\nAnd yes, physics can be tough. I know. My Bachelors is in physics. And with only a passing familiarity with architecture, I have no trouble understanding that it's tough too. You're learning to design buildings. I'd be a little horrified if the training wasn't rigorous and challenging. Props to you for aiming high.\n\nInternship. Only passing familiar with architecture, but work in tech. Not a programmer myself, but I work with them. Also knew multiple CS majors in school. Even then your statement that internships in your field aren't generally available until after completing the junior year was sensible.\n\nWith CS, I can easily see a lot of offices being able to find things for an intern that's only conpleted their sophmore year to do. In my own office, they'd probably just pick a low priority feature request and let the intern at it. If the resulting code was usable, great. They'ld still have one of the regular engineers review it and polish it.  If not, oh well. It's not like we haven't had code projects that got scrapped before. It happens.\n\nOther fields, naw. Sophmores ain't learned enough yet to be usable as an intern or for an internship to be beneficial to them. Comes as no surprise that architecture would be one of them.\n\nChores & costs. Uhm... do they realize that even if you'd gotten an internship, it would have impacted your availability to do chores. And depending on the firm and their expectations for interns, possibly more than taking summer classes will.\n\nSame thing with costs. Not all internships pay. Or if they do pay, they may pay a pittance. No guarantee you wouldn't need help money-wise, even with an internship.\n\nSummer classes. You are taking a sensible course of action to help ensure that you will graduate on time, if not early. You're in the process of developing yourself into an independent adult who will be able to be self-supporting. This does not happen instantly.\n\nIn order to do that, it can, and often times does, mean making choices about how you spend your time that prioritize progress towards your career over your family. \n\nBesides. Can almost guarantee the cost of those summer classes is less than the cost of taking them during the regular school year. If taking these classes can cut even one term off your senior year, it will be a net benefit.\n\nSocial life. Love that they're trying to compare your sister's social life as a junior in HS to yours as a college sophmore. Like hello. That's as may be, it's still a frog.\n\nAnd frankly, as a parent, I'd be less concerned about whether you have a social life and more concerned about whether you were overworking yourself and heading to burnout.\n\nSerious question. Are you more introverted than others in your family? Comparing your sistees social life to yours gives a certain level of introvert in a house of extroverts feel.\n\nThat they may be complaining ultimately because you do not fit into their mindset of life and they would rather find fault than appreciate you for who you are.\n\nIn any case, they are clearly more focused on how you can help them now in the short term than on how they can help you be successful in the long run.\n\nAs a parent of teens not much younger than your sister myself, I know I would always rather my focus be on how I can help them to become successful and independent. Even if it takes longer than I might want it to.", "Some of the smartest people I know never went to college.  Doing well in college doesn't mean one will do well in life.  \n\nRichard Branson dropped out of school and later founded Virgin Records. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard and later found in microsoft. Many successful people struggled at school. \n\nYour parents comparing you to your siblings is unfair, toxic, and useless.  Use it to motivate yourself to succeed.  Network as much as you can. Focus on your strengths and how you can use them to succeed.", "OP you are your own person and deserve to be treated as such. I got an internship my first year, but do you know what that should mean? Absolutely nothing to you. Everyone else\u2019s achievements don\u2019t define you. You have a 3.6 GPA and you are killing it! My GPA was a 2.9 when I graduated so that should show you how much that first internship really benefited me lol. Your parents won\u2019t say this, but I\u2019m proud of you. Please keep killing it.\n\n\nNTA x1000", "NTA , you are trying and that's the important thing , studying doesn't come easy to some people and it's not a indicator of your intelligence or success. If you are happy and ultimately going to end up in a place where you feel like YOU are successful that's all that matters . It is wrong of them to compare you and treat you as inferior , from your post you aren't some lazy dropout just not as perhaps over achieving as your siblings. My grandma is the same as your parents - likes to brag about her grandchildrens achievements (my cousin became a lawyer but later quit because he hated it but its all we heard about) and all she talks about is his 'wonderful ex girlfriend who she adored because she came from a wealthy family. I'm not so Impressive to her because I don't have a degree and don't have a job she can brag about (I work for the infection control and cleaning department of a local busy hospital) but I did point out to her that one - I'm actually financially comfortable and two I'm the only one of the grandchildren that is doing a job that helps keep a hospital up and running and helping to keep patients free from nasty bugs and infections (She did shut up then).\n\nIt's OK for parents and family to be proud of you that's wonderful but so they can compare you to others and use it to make your feel inferior is not OK. They are creating unnecessary wedges between you and your siblings and impacting your mental health.", "NTA You stood up for yourself. That's good. \n\nSide note: You aren't less intelligent than your siblings. Intelligence is not so easily quantifiable and just because they're having an easier time at these specific things. Don't let that kind of talk get into your head.", "NTA. Op, your folks seem to be the old school type that value the firstborn and all they do\u2026 sister is still young but she\u2019s the only female AND she\u2019s the baby.  Bet you anything she\u2019ll be entitled and spoiled AF by the time she\u2019s in her 20\u2019s. \ud83d\ude44 They\u2019re giving you the \u201cmiddle child\u201d treatment. That really sucks.\n\nSTICK TO TOUR GUNS BUDDY!! You picked a career that will make you happy and you\u2019re working hard. You are not a burden\u2026 and if they make you feel like one, please find a way to move out ASAP. There\u2019s ways to cover expenses and tuitions while working and living alone, many people do it and eventually finish paying their loans.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and keep working hard op!!", "NTA 3.6 is a good gpa. You have nothing to be ashamed of. It's wrong of your parents to compare. People aren't apples.", "ESH. You're too old to be throwing temper tantrums and for not being able to recognize your own shortcomings. Plenty of parents (mine included) don't help pay for things or don't let you live at home for free while at university. It also isn't unusual to have no social life while at university. If this isn't what you want to be doing with your life, then don't do it. But if it is, sorry, you kinda need to deal.\n\nThat said, if they're offering to help you they shouldn't be calling you a burden.\n\nTbh, you're leaching a bit more than you need to. there's no reason you can't take 20 minutes a day to help with chores. If your classes are 3 days a week, there's no reason you can't get a part time job to pay for the gas.", "YTA. \n\nNobody called you the black sheep, and even if they did, I\u2019m not sure what you think declaring yourself not to be the black sheep would do. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason why a full-time college student without a job can\u2019t contribute to household chores or have a part time job to pay for their own gas.   \n\nIf you are spending 80+ hours a week working in your undergrad degree, I would consider a different degree that would allow you to contribute to your household and take on more of your own living expenses.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
