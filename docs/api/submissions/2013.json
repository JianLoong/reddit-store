Mom isn't in the right space to care for her and Dad doesn't seem to understand that when that baby was born everything he wanted to do for the next few years should take the back burner. I'm not saying he shouldn't have fun and time to himself, but if he is taking care of his child then having his wedding night escapades needs to be the least of his worries.

There\u2019s a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that your brother was ever asked to do what he\u2019s asking you. Babysitting a child and watching a newborn overnight are two entirely different tasks.

Sometimes they just don\u2019t go back to sleep or, in the case of my child, they get reflux and you have to hold them upright to reflux for 45 minutes before their tummy settles enough to sleep, again. They are incredibly high maintenance and draining and not your responsibility in the slightest. Wanting to preserve your own sleep and comfort does not make you a bad aunt or sister, it makes you a normal human being and your brother a selfish, manipulative, and irresponsible father to his newborn. If he wants the night away from the baby, he can pay for the help or get it from your parents, who know *exactly* what they\u2019re getting into (although something tells me he\u2019s asking you because he\u2019s already asked them and they said no).", "I'm still trying to wrap my head around within 9 months he knocked up one girl, broke up, got with another girl, got engaged, had a baby, and is getting married.

However, I do value my family and its just one night. The communication was bad, and calling you an A is a bit harsh, but i want to make clear, that your behaviour is not right either.", "Might be easier for OP to say yes then hand the baby back when it first wakes up (which will be well before the groom is even near bed), park the baby stuff outside grooms room and go to bed in peace.", "NTA. Screw your brother", "So some are saying you should just do it. You don\u2019t owe it to him because you are siblings unless you feel you do.  Also, how much experience do you have with infants?  I babysat for tons of kids and babies from 11 yrs old, but even at 19 I would never have taken care of a newborn over night.  My guess is they expect you to care for infant at wedding also.  You don\u2019t invite someone to a function and say, by the way, her\u2019s my kid for you to watch.  Who even has a wedding when they have a 2 week old baby they are caring for.  I realize different family dynamics are often at play here culturally and some would find this totally acceptable. NTA", "NTA guarantee he wouldn't be asking if you were his brother.", "NTA - your brother is thinking with his little head, which is why he is in this situation.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask him to babysit you, your parents did.  If he is going to use that logic then his child should be watched by your parents.\n\nHave you even watched a baby that young before?\n\nSitting with one for an hour or so is completely different from an overnight stay.  You absolutely will not get any rest that night and that is exactly why they don\u2019t want the baby in their room.", "NTA. If your parents or grandparents haven't already noted the ridiculousness of leaving a newborn with an unwilling college student, then you can't depend on their support in this. It may be that they expect you to be the nanny because you're a lady, or because they paid for your room, or because they think you should be practicing to have kids of your own.\n\nAnother concern here is who is caring for the baby all the other hours of the day. The bridal party and parents will likely be busy, so they may expect YOU to do that, too. And who is caring for the baby during the honeymoon? And is the new wife actually happy to raise this child?\n\nYou might check your syllabi and realize that you forgot about a huge project, exam, or retest happening that week, sadly preventing you from attending a long-distance wedding. Or maybe you notice COVID symptoms a week before and can't get on the flight at all. Or go the adult route and have a conversation with your brother and parents about the plans for baby BEFORE you go. You could also be a stereotypical inconsiderate college student and disappear for most of the trip, be late for events, and be strangely unreachable by phone. Maybe you forgot your charger or something's wrong with the battery!", "NTA \n\nWow. I can\u2019t believe your brother is getting married, let alone TRAVELING with a 2 week old newborn. He\u2019s automatically the asshole for doing that to such a young baby. \n\nMy heart breaks for that baby. Why couldn\u2019t they wait a few months? This is bad parenting bordering on abuse.", "NTA If you didnt make the baby and you havent accepted responsibility to care for them, it is unreasonable to expect someone to take them overnight without asking. Its a big ask.\nAt 15 I shared a room with my youngest sister when she was a newborn. I also shared a room with my own child when she was born. The difference is stark. I had a very real urge to murder my sister every time she woke up crying. Granted it had been almost 15 years later but I did not experience even a significant level of annoyance when it was my own child.", "NTA his kid his responsibility, so wondering why the big rush to get married 7 months? Wowza", "NTA. 2 week old baby and you were TOLD you have to babysit all night? Don\u2019t go, refuse, change rooms but don\u2019t do it.", "NTA that\u2019s what grandparents are for", "Honestly watching a newborn baby all night isn't that hard, but ofc it depends if you never held a baby in your arms you can't. I watched after newborn babies since I was 8 (not like I wanted to, i had to do it) but I have to admit that it's really tiring.", "That's right, he should babysit nonetheless so de baby owes him now! He could use this in his advantage later in life!", "> Is it inconvenient to share a room with an unborn baby?\n\nA lot less inconvenient than it is to share with a newborn :)\n\nUnless OP has experience with looking after newborns, this is an insane ask.  And her brother didn't even have the decency to ask. He 'told' her.", "Makes me highly suspicious about his and Rita\u2019s parenting skills.  That poor baby.", "I can't wrap my head around the fact that they are leaving the house with a 2 week baby let alone getting married. Also, the baby still has a mother who could take her for the night.", ">>Watching a newborn baby overnight alone for a 19 yo is a big ask. <<\n\n>>No, it's not. Teenagers younger than 19 baby-sit. Teenagers younger than that have babies.\n\nYes, it is.  Most people don\u2019t hire inexperienced teenage babysitters for newborns.  \n\nThe rest of your comment is spot-on, especially regarding the groom\u2019s life choices. \ud83d\udea9", "Apart from waking up every few hours for feeds n changes sure.", "I'd go, only if I can be the best man and end my speech with \"and I'll see half of you next time\"", "I had two hard dating rules, no one at work, and no one involved with someone else. Never thought to add no one whose ex hadn't even given birth yet.", "\u2026 and drag everyone to the other side of the country."]}
