No. Not your responsibility. \n\nWhat people are struggling with is that the moment you realized you had feelings the friendship was over. Which is something a lot of women deal with when being friends with men. We think we\u2019re all on the same page about what\u2019s going on and being friends, but a majority of the time the rug gets pulled from underneath us. For me, it\u2019s happened almost every time I\u2019ve made a guy friend. The shoe of feelings has dropped every time but twice. And one of those is because he\u2019s gay. Each of the times the shoe dropped, those friends were no longer friends to me. It makes me wary now every time a guy wants to be friends, because the track record of them staying around is nearly non-existent. Is this friendship for real? Is it gonna last? Or is it gonna end up like all the others? Does he *really* want to be friends or is he after something else? One was even my best friend for a period of three years, and it gutted me permanently. It just really gets exhausting for us when this stuff happens. And every woman I know has these stories. *Every* woman. \n\nLike I said, NTA. And I\u2019m not saying that the people bringing this up are right nor am I saying they\u2019re wrong. It just exists. It just happens. I\u2019m just saying this is extremely common. Extremely.

Yes, I know it's hard. But are you only willing to be in easy friendships?", "Oof, I was on your side until this comment. I can understand if a friend needed some time but to end the friendship point blank, yeesh that's awful.\n\n\nBut  in your case, I wouldn't want to be friends with her cuz she's acting entitled to your money ( which she is not)", "He didn't \"fuck zone\" her.

He's moving the goalposts so his own behaviour is always acceptable regardless of whether what he's doing is actually acceptable - first he has thoughts or feelings, which is always okay. But then to 'stay true' to himself, and in the spirit of honesty, he has to 'express' them. As you've identified, that may not always be acceptable. \n\nBut he's conflated *having* thoughts and feelings with *expressing* thoughts and feelings, so that limiting his expression is 'bordering on thought police territory'. No. It's not neurodivergent, it's just self-indulgent and entitled. The only way for him to 'stay true' to himself is to do anything he wants and not do anything he doesn't want.

Hulka!", "She wasn't, and he was a shitty friend for not considering her feelings.", "That's why it can feel violating. He stopped seeing her as a friend, and instead as someone to fuck.", "People can be friends even after failed relationships, even marriages. \"All or nothing\" seems quite silly when the friendship itself seemed \"solid\" and long-term by your own account.

You could still have fun on the trip.", "You could have waited for the trip to get closer to her or even ask her out afterwards, the fact you did it before the trip is beyond me....you backed out of the trip to cause a scene. In the end its still your fault and your lack of judgement caused this.", "NTA\n\nTime to end this friendship too.", "NTA for the flights but YTA for abandoning your friendship because you can\u2019t handle rejection.

She was your friend (and nothing more) when you made the travel plans, and she\u2019s your friend (and nothing more) now. So why did you cancel?
