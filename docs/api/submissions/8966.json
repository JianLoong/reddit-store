It sounds uncomfortable, but that\u2019s not the same as a violation.\n\nI think a lot of couples start out as friends, and as long as a friendship isn\u2019t predicated on one party using the friendship as a Trojan horse to a relationship, \u201cviolation\u201d seems like a bit of an overreaction.", "It did happen, though. The reason he's cancelling is because of the date thing. That changes the circumstances. It probably made the girl feel like he wasn't a real friend, and he was only trying to get into her pants the whole time. I'm not saying she's right, but she is the one being wronged because OP couldn't handle the complexities of an adult relationship. OP should have considered how all this would effect the trip, and dealt with that way before the date thing. What did he expect, they'd go out and then run off together on a romantic getaway? That is so unfair to his friend.

He has a responsibility to think through his feelings and what effect this would have on his friend before rushing forward to share his feelings. It was inconsiderate. Then when he didn't get what wanted immediately, instead of trying to work it out he just dropped the friend and trip.", "Ah... yeah friendship is probably done tbh. If it were me I'd have just reimbursed her regardless, if she decided to go it would offset the stuff you were meant to pay. \n\nAnd honestly... been there, confessed to a friend I caught feelings and was rejected,  still went to his practices and open mics and still hung out with him the very next day because I valued the friendship more than anything else.

He literally offered to make sure that his friend didn\u2019t lose any money.  I certainly would not want to go on a trip with someone who has unrequited feelings for me.  It\u2019s not his fault that he caught feelings, and it\u2019s not her fault that she\u2019s disappointed in the fact that her friendship with OP is diminishing.  It IS her fault for expecting OP to pay for someone else to go on the trip with her.  What if he\u2019d gotten sick beforehand?  That would also not be his fault, and the outcome would be the same.", "He\u2019s not saying he doesn\u2019t want or can\u2019t be friends, he saying that due to the rejection - that happened *last week* - he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable going on an out-of-town, overnight trip, and he\u2019s giving her at minimum four weeks notice before their trip was supposed to happen. That\u2019s completely reasonable. Also, boiling down their friendship to just physical attraction is very presumptuous.

That\u2019s completely reasonable. \n\nIf I were in her shoes, I would absolutely understand him backing out and would feel grateful for his offer to compensate.

He recognized that he had feelings for his friend, asked her out, got rejected, and determined that going on an overnight trip with her would make things worse, not better.

Now, I don\u2019t think OP played his cards right and shouldn\u2019t have put the girl on the spot like that, but the idea of two friends starting to date isn\u2019t some wild, unheard of situation.  \nI ended up in a relationship with my best friend for years, but it didn\u2019t start with either one of us bluntly professing feelings for the other and putting them on the spot to feel the same way. It just sort of happened. We both knew each other well enough to be able to tell how the other person felt and wouldnt have risked our friendship on a crush.", "He, of course, should have done the thing that men do and suffered in silence. /s\n\nReally though, it's probably better that he said something before the trip.

It'd make me second guess the intentions of everything that happened during the trip.", "I think two months ago he shouldn't have planned this trip. I think he should have waited to tell her until after the trip (if at all). I think he should have tried to look at her the way he'd look at a male friend.", "No. By the OP's story, they bought these in November. Things got blown up now with only a month's notice and she can't get her PTO canceled. She's probably mad and trying to find a way to at least still be able to have her plans that were canceled through no fault of her own. I don't think there's an issue for asking him to buy a ticket for someone else to replace him going since she's stuck. OP declined. I say that's fair too. If it were me, I would have just given the amount I would have had to pay for her refund since she still wants to go. I don't think OP is WRONG to want to cancel. It's just unfortunate but if there's a fault, it would be OP's. Again, not an actual problem other than she's stuck now. The only \"out of line\" thing that OP has mentioned is her asking for a ticket for someone else to go which seems fair. They weren't dating and she's asking her ex-boyfriend to pay for her new boyfriend's tickets. They were friends going on a friend vacation until their friendship has come to a close. She asked so she can get someone else to go to the beach in March with her, OP said no.

Bc if I was his friend, and he told me after the trip he was into me, that would make me wonder why the trip took place at all.  \n\nThe idea that he should get over his feelings by pretending his friend is same gender is really unrealistic.
