As I'd be having serious doubts if my partner of six years didn't see me as part of their family.", "NAH. Different people have different approaches... and families especially each have their own culture. It's entirely possible that she has one of those families where the idea of bringing someone who isn't a relative instead of filing up every seat with someone who is would be unthinkable -- not just get her into trouble with them, but be something that didn't even occur to her that anyone would do otherwise (just as it didn't occur to you that anyone wouldn't invite their partner). \n\nYou're within reason to be unhappy and say so. But remember that SHE had no idea that you were saving up and planning surprises and trying to make it special between you!!! She can't read your mind, and you wanted to make it a surprise, so you didn't tell her. The result is that she 1) appears to come from a family where this is simply the way they do things, and 2) had not been informed that there was any reason to rethink the idea. \n\nSo I'm not going to call either of you an AH. You just crossed wires here. Use your words and tell her that you're disappointed, and ask her whether and when you can expect to be treated on a level with family, because you already see her that way? What she says in response to that will tell you a lot about whether you're in a relationship with equal emotional commitment or not.", "NTA, but even though she had a limited number of tickets, she didn\u2019t handle this well with you,a significant other of 6 years. You might need to adjust your expectations of this relationship accordingly.", "NTA this is completely reasonable. \u201cfamily first\u201d being her response is really fucked up when you\u2019ve been dating for 6 years - you are her family now as well. graduation is a really major life event and she chose to cut you out of that. if i were you i would rethink my importance in her life and make necessary amendments from my conclusions.", "NTA\n\nI rarely say this as \u2018each relationship is unique\u2019 but\u2026\n\nWritings on the wall. I\u2019ve never once heard of any partner not being invited to something like this.. especially when they\u2019ve been together this long.\n\nJust know where you sit on the priority list for future events.\n\nAnd what a bloody shame\u2026 sorry OP\n\nFINAL NOTE - mate, put some periods in your sentences.. absolute nightmare to read that mess \ud83d\ude24", "NTA you are in a long term relationship with someone this means you share a life am I correct? Her graduation is a life event that most ppl would want their significant other present. I also understand that 5 tickets aren\u2019t much and family is important but geez she could have at least sat and discussed with you instead of you having to question her about it.", "NTA\n\nNot even a little. Not at all. You have been with her for SIX years. This isn't a new relationship. The fact that she didn't even consider you is not cool. The only thing I can think of is whether or not she has any friends who have access to 5 tickets but don't need all 5 of their tickets? At least then you could still go. I know a few people that did that.", "NTA. She didn't know you were planning this thoughtful surprise, but even so she excluded you from one of the most important days of her life. You're right to be disappointed", "NTA. That's honestly kind of messed up. A 6 year relationship definitely warrants an invite to a big event like graduation. Edit: number of years", "NTA\n\nYou need to start thinking about if she really does prioritize you and what you mean to her. If she does not prioritize you like you prioritize her you need to be with somebody who puts you first yes, I understand. Family comes first but in this case it should not be like this. This is a big event. You have been with her for a long time and for her to not even think about you is devastating she didn\u2019t even think about telling you that you cannot go until you asked, you literally had to ask her if you are invited to go , that\u2019s not how it should be. She should have let you know beforehand if she really could not have you there but still I don\u2019t understand how she could do that to you because you\u2019ve been together so long you need to analyze other situations and events where she does not put you first, because it seems like she\u2019s not prioritizing you and her relationship with you.", "NTA I understand how you feel I would be sad and disappointed as well.", "I agree with what others have said about you taking note of Your relationship expectations after this.\n\nI was a returning student after dropping out 15 years prior, and so my graduation was a big f-king deal. We had ticket limitations so I begged others in my department for their spare tickets. I managed to get 20 tix for my parents, siblings and their spouses, aunt and uncle, my boyfriend (at the time), and even my best friend. (LOL I had a cheering section). That\u2019s what people do when there are ticket limits, and it\u2019s not even that hard (and I\u2019m an INFJ, so asking people for stuff is hard for me! lol). The fact that your girlfriend didn\u2019t even try says a lot.\n\nNTA", "You're NTA for being disappointed. But you better get used to disappointment if you don't start communicating about things that matter so much to you. She is not a mind reader. She didn't know before and does not know now how much you wanted to be there, since you just shrugged it off like it did not matter.\n\nSurely she has a friend or classmate who has an extra ticket. If she knew how much you wanted to go, wouldn't she at least ask around and try to get you a ticket?\n\nOr is she just as bad as communicating and her \"sorry, family first\" is just a passive-aggressive dig because you've been together 6 years and you're not at least engaged? (I know that may be really reaching, but without actually knowing either of you, in the abstract it seems possible.)", "NTA. Now you know where you stand in terms of priority in her life. Honestly, reflect on your relationship. After 6 years of being together, you still aren't a priority to her. Moments like this put a crack in a relationship.", "NTA: She chose her uncle over you? And you been with her for 6 years? Send her back to the streets j/k. Feel what you feel? I know I would feel what you\u2019re feeling", "NAH. But tbh something about the way you keep mentioning the amount you wanted to spend on her expensive gifts comes off weird. Like I was going to spend all this money on you, and you're not even inviting me... sorta.", "Nah\n\nYou're allowed to be frustrated\n\nShe's allowed to invite who she wants", "NTA. This is pretty sucky. You\u2019re not entitled to attend, but I would recalibrate my expectations in the relationship IIWY.", "INFO: Has her uncle played an important role in her life (e.g., substitute father)?", "NTA. Feeling the way you doesn't make you an AH. But yeah, family is first, and you should rejoice at that, because it means that if you have a family of your own later, she will value them over everyone.", "NTA\n\n\nYou're not a priority for her. I would discuss what's in hand for your future as this would make me feel that she doesn't have it planned with me in it.", "Info: is anyone traveling to come or all you all close in distance?", "A side point perhaps, but thousands spent on graduation gifts that you had to save for, for months seems unwise, regardless of the invitation situation.", "NTA- After 6 years she should be considering you as family. It would of been nice if she would of actually sat down and discussed not inviting you before you had to ask about it.", "ESH. Y'all should have been discussing this since, I dunno, Christmas break?\n\nExtravagant gifting is all well and good, but what did SHE want? \n\nAnd you should have made it clear that it was important to you to be there, but you took that for granted. \n\nYes, you're allowed to be frustrated, as others have pointed out. But it sounds like you played a role in setting up the frustration", "NTA\u2026.is she close with her uncle?  Has he been a father figure?\n\nNonetheless, you\u2019re allowed to be upset, 6 years is a long time and I would think you would be invited since you\u2019re a huge part of her life.  You supported her and seem so happy of her accomplishment.", "INFO:  Was there a ticket limit?  That is a lot of times the case.  If there was, does she know anyone who doesn't need all of theirs?  NTA it sucks, but look at it this way...yes you're her boyfriend of 6 years, but her family has you beat, bud, they've been there her whole life.", "NTA-this is a big event in her life and it's messed up how she went about this.", "NAH.  You were planning on attending and looking forward to attending (which is\nKind of surprising - the only person less interested in going to my college graduation than me, was my then boyfriend, now husband - he would have accused me of cruel and unusual punishment if I\u2019d forced him to go) so I understand why you are disappointed.  \n\nBut since this ceremony is important to your girlfriend, she may want to invite the people who supported her through her entire education process, both emotionally and financially.  Or she may have made a promise to her grandma along time ago.  Or her mom can\u2019t come without her siblings. Or she didn\u2019t think you would want to go.  There could be lots of reasons.\n\nLook at it this way this graduation is the final step in leaving her childhood and youth behind before she enters full time into adulthood.  So she may want the people who had the biggest influence on and shared that period of time with her at that last ceremony.  And those people are her closest family members.  Your relationship belongs to the next phase of her life, her adulthood.  If you stay together you will replace those family members in importance and you will have the rest of your life together, attending all of her important life events.", "NTA, \n\nI would still do a gift for her, especially if you want to stay in the relationship with her. Just don\u2019t go overboard and do what you were going to do. \n\nHowever, it is also time to look at your relationship as to why she chose her family over you. If after 6 years she doesn\u2019t see you as family there must be a reason. And it\u2019s time to evaluate your relationship. \n\nWas she expecting a proposal or something like that. Did she not feel like you supported her enough during this time? \n\nObviously there is a reason why you didn\u2019t get to go. It\u2019s now your job to figure out where your relationship is now and what you are going to do about it.", "NTA\n\nBut look up second or third fiddle in the dictionary. Your pic will be right there.\n\nSorry dude.", "NTA if i was you i wouldn't go all out... she doesn't realize its hurtful to u ... when all u wanna do os show her how proud u are..", "NTA. You are completely entitled to your emotions. It's a disappointment for sure to have something no longer happen you were looking forward to. But you can absolutely still celebrate with her! Sadly a lot of schools have ticket limits and it makes for impossible decisions to be made. But her family are the ones who possibly have been looking to this day since she was little or be the ones who helped guide her to college. It didn't sound like you were a big jerk about it just upset", "ESH she should at the very least have been open in communication from the moment she booked the tickets, but dude... \"it just doesnt sit well with me knowing how much i  saved up\" shows youre completely missing the point of the graduation... also, its not about you", "NAH i have been dating my bf for 8 years now. I do consider him family but i get what she said about inviting only \"family\" i honestly would have done the same i dont know if she is that close to her family as i am but if i were given only 5 tickets my parents sister and grandma would come first in that kind of situation. Is not like she loves you any less, it is just that sometimes like a graduation time you want it to be with those people. I am sure she would want to celebrate with you too! Sometimes parents and grandparents really value that kind of events too, my grandparents for intance would be furious if i didnt invite them (not furious but they would surely get sad they didnt get to go to their grandkid graduation). It is not an ideal situation..but is one where i think you should try to be more understanding. Of course you are in all your rights to feel offended and you should talk to her  about how she feels. Just know that this is a tricky situation.", "You can feel bad, but should also be understanding. You can still celebrate with her, but she only has 5 tickets and has 5 family members.", "NAH there simply aren't enough invitations. You should still be able to give gifts, congratulate her and join for pictures. Ask if they're doing dinner after. Honestly those are more fun anyway.", "You're entitled to be sad about not being on her guest list, but YTA for arguing about it with her. Did you pay her tuition? Also, I'm curious about the \"whole pack of expensive gifts to give her for graduating,\" you can only give them to her at the public ceremony? Are you doing the showering of presents for her or for you? Because if it's for her, you can do it the next day, but if it's to show what a great guy you are... either that makes YTA again, or... well, YTA. It makes me wonder what you're not saying. Because the \"Gift Showerer\" can be a big red flag, especially when those gifts are showered only where everyone gets to see what a \"great guy\" you are.", "NTA. she isn't either though. maybe you could meet her after the ceremony to still take pictures in her cap and gown", "NTA", "Esh This isn't about you, regardless of what you want to spend on her. The fact a ticket to the graduation was the price of your generosity speaks volumes.\n\nChanged judgment, meant to put Esh the first time around. Brain fart.", "NAH - You can still go even if you cant sit inside if you want. Just be there when you know the program is ending or has ended and you can give your gifts to her by the parking lot or set up something nice when she comes over to visit you. I know it doesnt seem romantic and not what youve imagined how things would go but there are other ways to show your feelings or celebrate the success. \n\nIf plan A cant work, then go to plan B. Your efforts will not go to waste. Its just a change of situation.\n\nJust because she coudnt invite you, it doesnt mean youre not her priority. Maybe she did it as an obligation because it is family. \n\nAlso, it is her graduation. It is not about you. Shes allowed to invite whoever she wants.", "YTA  \nsaying \"knowing how much I saved up and excited I was to surprise her-\" makes it sound like its more about YOU than her. its HER graduation, she can pick and choose who she wants. a caring partner would still be able to support and congratulate the other even without being at the official graduation. if you are asking her to pick between you and her family then YOUR the problem", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He didn't yell or scream and when she said she's taking family he's said ok sounds good. \n\nSo he's an AH for being sad and having feelings that he's keeping to himself, to not upset his gf?", "No we haven\u2019t spoke about marriage that much tbh w u, I was gonna propose when I felt I was ready financially and saved up a good amount by next year", "No they\u2019re just very close, not as a father figure at all", "I totally get your point, and that's kind of what I meant. If she wanted him there, he'd be there. She had a bunch of tickets as it was, and still didn't pick him. I don't think that necessarily makes her the AH. It is however very telling about her level of commitment to the relationship.", "This is quite toxic. If you are unhappy with the direction of a relationship just leave.\n\nDon't \"act accordingly\" and then do things you think are gonna hurt her or not invite her to things you actually want her to be at just because she didn't invite you.\n\nMy advice would be to just leave, if after 6 years she doesn't consider you important enough to see her graduate then I think you deserve someone better.", "just sucking it up on this one is a pretty terrible idea. You've just found out your GF of 6 years doesn't see you as important to her life. It's okay to be upset this time my dude.", "I do have to ask, how close is she to her family? How important is her family to her? \n\nI ask because my dad has made it a habit to scream and yell at any major achievement of my life so if I had to pick between my dad's endless support and a partner who could possibly leave me, I'd pick my dad, I say NAH just think about why she probably made the decision that she did and talk to her but ultimately accept her answer.", "We\u2019ll least you know you don\u2019t matter to her before you proposed!!", "Once everything is over you should definitely communicate with her about it. Don\u2019t cause a scene now or you\u2019ll be the boyfriend who ruined her graduation but definitely bring it up later. You are NTA.\n\nShe is. After 6 years, you should be the most important person in her life. You\u2019re 6th at best. And I wouldn\u2019t bank to hard on you being in that 6th position either buddy. That sucks hard. Kudos on maintaining your cool when your girlfriend of half a dozen years tells you you\u2019re not important to her.  \n\nI\u2019d be seriously reevaluating my commitment to this relationship. It\u2019s not that she thinks ill of you, it\u2019s that she just doesn\u2019t think of you.", "Does her family all live locally? Or are they traveling to see her graduate? Because if they are traveling as a family, that makes more sense.\n\n\nI feel like most people hate their university graduations and go because their parents make them. Did she express that she was really excited about graduation (not being able to graduate, the actual ceremony). Did you ever express to her that you really wanted to go?\n\n\nYou can still go out to dinner with her family and everything after.", "Someone you've been with for six years is family. Or they're just someone you're passing time with. OP thought they were the former - it seems like they're the latter.", "Ummm you should have hard feelings.  You aren\u2019t that important to her.  And after 6 years??? Cut your losses now.", "Yea, most people I know who went to college graduation did it because their parents made them.", "Rightfully so. It\u2019s such a shame to have put in so much effort for her only to realise she doesn\u2019t see you as part of her family. I do think you need to talk to her about it though. This might build resentment. 6 years is a long time yet she doesn\u2019t consider you family? Idk that just feels odd to me", "Do you think it would make a difference to her, if you guys were married?", "With all due respect to her I\u2019d never do that and mention, if anything she should", "OP- you will only know the answer if you talk to her and ask the questions. Do this after the ceremony and if you aren\u2019t satisfied with what she says, then it might be time to move on.", "Well, that's all sorts of plagiarism.", "You did all that and she didn't try to find you a ticket?   \nIts one thing if she said she was trying to get an extra one for you because she has to invite her family, that's understandable. But you wrote her final proposal and she didnt' even say she was trying to get you one? she just shut it down? sorry man but this seems like she used you. NTA", "are you saying the reason she could afford to study etc is because you financially supported her and helped with her assignments ..... did her uncle help with this", "If he didn't say a word then how exactly did he do what he says in the title?", "You make a good point. This isn't an appropriate question for this sub. \n\nHowever. I do think he's in the wrong for being upset/offended over this. This reads like uncle is likely father figure. Would op be this upset if it were her father? Would op instead imply grandma wasn't important enough to make the cut over him? \n\nIf he's proud he's proud. If not getting to go to the ceremony makes him less proud that's a him problem.", "Yeah I would put a pause on that.  You\u2019re not even in her top 5 of important people.  Reading your responses you seem very insecure.  Because no one would accept this treatment from someone they want to marry.", "NTA then, I don't understand why she wouldn't consider a significant other of 6 years important enough to go.", "Also, \"when I'm financially ready can sometimes be moving goalposts, or your idea of \"financially ready\" is different than hers - so you might not be as 100% on the same page as you think.\n\nJust fyi", "x2..time to move on..", "An uncle though?", "And she doesn't have the courteousy to outright say hey I only have 5 tickets so I can only invite abcdef. I'm sorry I can't get one for you.", "I really hate to say it\u2026 but damn, it\u2019s true. I personally would be devastated if I wasn\u2019t the first person invited to something while in a six year relationship.", "What? If you aren't expressing that you're interested in going to her graduation? How would she know. Maybe she just thought it would be boring, and is waiting for a \"congratulations, let me take you to dinner\"?", "I mean... Yes, she should. But the healthiest thing for you to do would be to say \"Hey, I'm super bummed that I didn't receive an invite. Is there something we can do afterward to celebrate?\u201d and if she says no to that, then you wait until the day after the celebration and say \"Hey, I am super happy you achieved your graduation goal. However after thinking about how long we have been together and your desire to dismiss me, I think it is better if we go our separate ways. Good luck.\"", "Ok. This is immature and resentful, you can deal with the results then", "Not just of, it is.  Though I'd be questioning if she thinks this is a real relationship though.", "Her uncle didn\u2019t support her financially or physically, she\u2019s just close with him", "Ask him. I didn't write it. I can only go by what OP said in their post. I've seen tons of people say one thing in their title and then say another in their post. I guess you'll have to ask OP and hope they answer.", "I barely argued, I said you\u2019d rather get ur uncle but not me and she said family first, I went silent then said alright sounds good, I\u2019ll go finish some work and I just left", "It wouldn\u2019t make me less proud but, if I were him, I\u2019d certainly be rethinking a marriage proposal.", "Ofcourse I wouldn\u2019t if she choose her father, but she\u2019s not close with him or any of that", "Maybe he helped finance her education.", "Depends on the uncle. One of my aunts is like another parent to me, like I call her on mother's day. She came to my graduation and I can't imagine not inviting her.", "Graduations ARE really boring  lol  An hours long even, and she'll be walking across the stage for about 5 seconds, and depending on where you can find a seat you might not even be able to see her.", "sorry to hear if it was me ... next time she asks for ANYTHING  ( help with assignments money etc ) tell her to ask her family instead i personally would be beyond offended use her graduation day to spend time with friends ...  \nim guessing she ill need to rent/buy the cap and gown let her family pay for it", "I guess I just don't understand living in a world where people are so desperate to go to an hours long, uncomfortable, boring event for 15 seconds of applause. It's gonna be recorded, there will be pictures, there can be professional couple shots with the gown and cap... The ceremony is hands down the worst part of the whole day. And when I was in uni it was a 3 person limit so the drama was only ever between family members, non married significant others just brought flowers and sometimes a ring with which to greet the graduate post ceremony. \n\nIn ops position, and I was planning on proposing, I'd consider using the time he doesn't have to be in the ceremony to *set up* the proposal. With the added bonus of, you know, becoming family and guaranteeing his ticket to every other boring event... Including the wedding.", "Then your beef is likely with her mother or grandmother pressuring her to include him. \n\nIn the end I just find this incredibly trivial. \n\nCongrats on not having to sit through a graduation ceremony. They're brutal.", "Put it this way. I don't blame you for being upset that you didn't make the cut. What I do blame you for is turning it into something to be upset WITH HER about. \"I'm sad that there aren't enough tickets\" is fine IMO. \"I'm upset that you didn't include me\" isn't, IMO, in this situation.", "Yea, everyone's talking about how awful the girlfriend is for not inviting him, and not considering him \"family\". Meanwhile, maybe she's thinking \"my mom is making me go to this thing, why would anyone want to be there, of course I'm not gonna subject OP to this\".", "But why would you want to marry someone who does not prioritize you after 6 years? That\u2019s crazy!"]}
