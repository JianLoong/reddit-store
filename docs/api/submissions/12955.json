As I'd be having serious doubts if my partner of six years didn't see me as part of their family.", "NAH. Different people have different approaches... and families especially each have their own culture. It's entirely possible that she has one of those families where the idea of bringing someone who isn't a relative instead of filing up every seat with someone who is would be unthinkable -- not just get her into trouble with them, but be something that didn't even occur to her that anyone would do otherwise (just as it didn't occur to you that anyone wouldn't invite their partner). \n\nYou're within reason to be unhappy and say so. But remember that SHE had no idea that you were saving up and planning surprises and trying to make it special between you!!! She can't read your mind, and you wanted to make it a surprise, so you didn't tell her. The result is that she 1) appears to come from a family where this is simply the way they do things, and 2) had not been informed that there was any reason to rethink the idea. \n\nSo I'm not going to call either of you an AH. You just crossed wires here. Use your words and tell her that you're disappointed, and ask her whether and when you can expect to be treated on a level with family, because you already see her that way? What she says in response to that will tell you a lot about whether you're in a relationship with equal emotional commitment or not.", "NTA, but even though she had a limited number of tickets, she didn\u2019t handle this well with you,a significant other of 6 years. You might need to adjust your expectations of this relationship accordingly.", "NTA this is completely reasonable. \u201cfamily first\u201d being her response is really fucked up when you\u2019ve been dating for 6 years - you are her family now as well. graduation is a really major life event and she chose to cut you out of that. if i were you i would rethink my importance in her life and make necessary amendments from my conclusions.", "NTA\n\nI rarely say this as \u2018each relationship is unique\u2019 but\u2026\n\nWritings on the wall. I\u2019ve never once heard of any partner not being invited to something like this.. especially when they\u2019ve been together this long.\n\nJust know where you sit on the priority list for future events.\n\nAnd what a bloody shame\u2026 sorry OP\n\nFINAL NOTE - mate, put some periods in your sentences.. absolute nightmare to read that mess \ud83d\ude24", "NTA you are in a long term relationship with someone this means you share a life am I correct? Her graduation is a life event that most ppl would want their significant other present. I also understand that 5 tickets aren\u2019t much and family is important but geez she could have at least sat and discussed with you instead of you having to question her about it.", "NTA\n\nNot even a little. Not at all. You have been with her for SIX years. This isn't a new relationship. The fact that she didn't even consider you is not cool. The only thing I can think of is whether or not she has any friends who have access to 5 tickets but don't need all 5 of their tickets? At least then you could still go. I know a few people that did that.", "NTA. She didn't know you were planning this thoughtful surprise, but even so she excluded you from one of the most important days of her life. You're right to be disappointed", "NTA. That's honestly kind of messed up. A 6 year relationship definitely warrants an invite to a big event like graduation. Edit: number of years", "NTA\n\nYou need to start thinking about if she really does prioritize you and what you mean to her. If she does not prioritize you like you prioritize her you need to be with somebody who puts you first yes, I understand. Family comes first but in this case it should not be like this. This is a big event. You have been with her for a long time and for her to not even think about you is devastating she didn\u2019t even think about telling you that you cannot go until you asked, you literally had to ask her if you are invited to go , that\u2019s not how it should be. She should have let you know beforehand if she really could not have you there but still I don\u2019t understand how she could do that to you because you\u2019ve been together so long you need to analyze other situations and events where she does not put you first, because it seems like she\u2019s not prioritizing you and her relationship with you.", "NTA I understand how you feel I would be sad and disappointed as well.", "I agree with what others have said about you taking note of Your relationship expectations after this.\n\nI was a returning student after dropping out 15 years prior, and so my graduation was a big f-king deal. We had ticket limitations so I begged others in my department for their spare tickets. I managed to get 20 tix for my parents, siblings and their spouses, aunt and uncle, my boyfriend (at the time), and even my best friend. (LOL I had a cheering section). That\u2019s what people do when there are ticket limits, and it\u2019s not even that hard (and I\u2019m an INFJ, so asking people for stuff is hard for me! lol). The fact that your girlfriend didn\u2019t even try says a lot.\n\nNTA", "You're NTA for being disappointed. But you better get used to disappointment if you don't start communicating about things that matter so much to you. She is not a mind reader. She didn't know before and does not know now how much you wanted to be there, since you just shrugged it off like it did not matter.\n\nSurely she has a friend or classmate who has an extra ticket. If she knew how much you wanted to go, wouldn't she at least ask around and try to get you a ticket?\n\nOr is she just as bad as communicating and her \"sorry, family first\" is just a passive-aggressive dig because you've been together 6 years and you're not at least engaged? (I know that may be really reaching, but without actually knowing either of you, in the abstract it seems possible.)", "NTA. Now you know where you stand in terms of priority in her life. Honestly, reflect on your relationship. After 6 years of being together, you still aren't a priority to her. Moments like this put a crack in a relationship.", "NTA: She chose her uncle over you? And you been with her for 6 years? Send her back to the streets j/k. Feel what you feel? I know I would feel what you\u2019re feeling", "NAH. But tbh something about the way you keep mentioning the amount you wanted to spend on her expensive gifts comes off weird. Like I was going to spend all this money on you, and you're not even inviting me... sorta.", "Nah\n\nYou're allowed to be frustrated\n\nShe's allowed to invite who she wants", "NTA. This is pretty sucky. You\u2019re not entitled to attend, but I would recalibrate my expectations in the relationship IIWY.", "INFO: Has her uncle played an important role in her life (e.g., substitute father)?", "NTA. Feeling the way you doesn't make you an AH. But yeah, family is first, and you should rejoice at that, because it means that if you have a family of your own later, she will value them over everyone.", "NTA\n\n\nYou're not a priority for her. I would discuss what's in hand for your future as this would make me feel that she doesn't have it planned with me in it.", "Info: is anyone traveling to come or all you all close in distance?", "A side point perhaps, but thousands spent on graduation gifts that you had to save for, for months seems unwise, regardless of the invitation situation.", "NTA- After 6 years she should be considering you as family. It would of been nice if she would of actually sat down and discussed not inviting you before you had to ask about it.", "ESH. Y'all should have been discussing this since, I dunno, Christmas break?\n\nExtravagant gifting is all well and good, but what did SHE want? \n\nAnd you should have made it clear that it was important to you to be there, but you took that for granted. \n\nYes, you're allowed to be frustrated, as others have pointed out. But it sounds like you played a role in setting up the frustration", "NTA\u2026.is she close with her uncle?  Has he been a father figure?\n\nNonetheless, you\u2019re allowed to be upset, 6 years is a long time and I would think you would be invited since you\u2019re a huge part of her life.  You supported her and seem so happy of her accomplishment.", "INFO:  Was there a ticket limit?  That is a lot of times the case.  If there was, does she know anyone who doesn't need all of theirs?  NTA it sucks, but look at it this way...yes you're her boyfriend of 6 years, but her family has you beat, bud, they've been there her whole life.", "NTA-this is a big event in her life and it's messed up how she went about this.", "NAH.  You were planning on attending and looking forward to attending (which is\nKind of surprising - the only person less interested in going to my college graduation than me, was my then boyfriend, now husband - he would have accused me of cruel and unusual punishment if I\u2019d forced him to go) so I understand why you are disappointed.  \n\nBut since this ceremony is important to your girlfriend, she may want to invite the people who supported her through her entire education process, both emotionally and financially.  Or she may have made a promise to her grandma along time ago.  Or her mom can\u2019t come without her siblings. Or she didn\u2019t think you would want to go.  There could be lots of reasons.\n\nLook at it this way this graduation is the final step in leaving her childhood and youth behind before she enters full time into adulthood.  So she may want the people who had the biggest influence on and shared that period of time with her at that last ceremony.  And those people are her closest family members.  Your relationship belongs to the next phase of her life, her adulthood.  If you stay together you will replace those family members in importance and you will have the rest of your life together, attending all of her important life events.", "NTA, \n\nI would still do a gift for her, especially if you want to stay in the relationship with her. Just don\u2019t go overboard and do what you were going to do. \n\nHowever, it is also time to look at your relationship as to why she chose her family over you. If after 6 years she doesn\u2019t see you as family there must be a reason. And it\u2019s time to evaluate your relationship. \n\nWas she expecting a proposal or something like that. Did she not feel like you supported her enough during this time? \n\nObviously there is a reason why you didn\u2019t get to go. It\u2019s now your job to figure out where your relationship is now and what you are going to do about it.", "NTA\n\nBut look up second or third fiddle in the dictionary. Your pic will be right there.\n\nSorry dude.", "NTA if i was you i wouldn't go all out... she doesn't realize its hurtful to u ... when all u wanna do os show her how proud u are..", "NTA. You are completely entitled to your emotions. It's a disappointment for sure to have something no longer happen you were looking forward to. But you can absolutely still celebrate with her! Sadly a lot of schools have ticket limits and it makes for impossible decisions to be made. But her family are the ones who possibly have been looking to this day since she was little or be the ones who helped guide her to college. It didn't sound like you were a big jerk about it just upset", "ESH she should at the very least have been open in communication from the moment she booked the tickets, but dude... \"it just doesnt sit well with me knowing how much i  saved up\" shows youre completely missing the point of the graduation... also, its not about you", "NAH i have been dating my bf for 8 years now. I do consider him family but i get what she said about inviting only \"family\" i honestly would have done the same i dont know if she is that close to her family as i am but if i were given only 5 tickets my parents sister and grandma would come first in that kind of situation. Is not like she loves you any less, it is just that sometimes like a graduation time you want it to be with those people. I am sure she would want to celebrate with you too! Sometimes parents and grandparents really value that kind of events too, my grandparents for intance would be furious if i didnt invite them (not furious but they would surely get sad they didnt get to go to their grandkid graduation). It is not an ideal situation..but is one where i think you should try to be more understanding. Of course you are in all your rights to feel offended and you should talk to her  about how she feels. Just know that this is a tricky situation.", "You can feel bad, but should also be understanding. You can still celebrate with her, but she only has 5 tickets and has 5 family members.", "NAH there simply aren't enough invitations. You should still be able to give gifts, congratulate her and join for pictures. Ask if they're doing dinner after. Honestly those are more fun anyway.", "You're entitled to be sad about not being on her guest list, but YTA for arguing about it with her. Did you pay her tuition? Also, I'm curious about the \"whole pack of expensive gifts to give her for graduating,\" you can only give them to her at the public ceremony? Are you doing the showering of presents for her or for you? Because if it's for her, you can do it the next day, but if it's to show what a great guy you are... either that makes YTA again, or... well, YTA. It makes me wonder what you're not saying. Because the \"Gift Showerer\" can be a big red flag, especially when those gifts are showered only where everyone gets to see what a \"great guy\" you are.", "NTA. she isn't either though. maybe you could meet her after the ceremony to still take pictures in her cap and gown", "NTA", "Esh This isn't about you, regardless of what you want to spend on her. The fact a ticket to the graduation was the price of your generosity speaks volumes.\n\nChanged judgment, meant to put Esh the first time around. Brain fart.", "NAH - You can still go even if you cant sit inside if you want. Just be there when you know the program is ending or has ended and you can give your gifts to her by the parking lot or set up something nice when she comes over to visit you. I know it doesnt seem romantic and not what youve imagined how things would go but there are other ways to show your feelings or celebrate the success. \n\nIf plan A cant work, then go to plan B. Your efforts will not go to waste. Its just a change of situation.\n\nJust because she coudnt invite you, it doesnt mean youre not her priority. Maybe she did it as an obligation because it is family. \n\nAlso, it is her graduation. It is not about you. Shes allowed to invite whoever she wants.", "YTA  \nsaying \"knowing how much I saved up and excited I was to surprise her-\" makes it sound like its more about YOU than her. its HER graduation, she can pick and choose who she wants. a caring partner would still be able to support and congratulate the other even without being at the official graduation. if you are asking her to pick between you and her family then YOUR the problem", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it\u2019s time for an honest sit down conversation about whether this relationship has the same long term goals.", "You need to ditch her after her graduation as her gift if you aren\u2019t a priority in her life after 6 years together. Go party at a club, and take yourself out for a treat.", "NTA. As other have said bro, she didn't even THINK of having you there. You have been with her for 6 years, that is a lot of time. When I graduated, I was with my fiance for 7 years at the time. She was quite literally the first person I wanted there. We Are still together and June is 21 years as a couple. \n\nWhat bothers me is the fact that your gf didn't just flat out say to you \"Hey I can only get 5 tickets and my family all really want to go. Do you mind if I invite them?\" Then she would be a good person and at least showed you she cared. She did not do this. I personally think she is only still with you just so she wasn't alone during her time in college. I would expect her to be trying to \"phase you out.\" \n\nAlso, do NOT be afraid to confront your significant other. If you don't agree with them, you can talk to them without yelling. If they shut you down and get defensive, then they are hiding something or don't really care about you. Sorry to say, she doesn't respect you. So I worry that she doesn't care for you either.", "A lot of times other students have extra tickets they will give you or sell you\u2026 maybe something to look into", "NTA. \n\nBig YTA for your gf because - \n\na) She just said that she doesn't consider you family\nb) She essentially just said that you are the sixth important person in her life\nc) She didn't even let you know that she couldn't take you until you asked. \n\nIf she doesn't apologize for this and clear up the air, I've got some bad news for you. Even if she doesn't approach you, you need to go and talk to her.", "NAH leaning to N T A\n\nI get it I'm a family person too and would like my nuclear family there, but after being in each other's life's so significantly for what is probably a fourth of your lifes, I'd be reevaluating where our relationship stands in her list of priorities if she didn't even try or had a conversation about this. Try to bring it up to her after the graduation and see what happens from there.", "NTA. You are understandably disappointed and rightfully so. She's allowed to invite who she wants. But for a couple together for 6 years, I'm surprised you both didn't communicate about it sooner.", "Yeah if it were maybe a 1-2 year relationship it'd matter less but 6 years is way too long to not consider your partner family", "Thats weird though. Its a surprise meaning a secret she doesnt know about. Having a conversation about where your relationships stands over an issue the other party is unaware of seems a bit...crazy? Maybe obsessive? Idk but it comes off as unhinged and scary to me.\n\nAnd yeah its fair to ask why she doesnt want him there. But now that the weight of a surprise gift is in the situation the whole things kind of ehhh corrupted I guess. Id just drop it. Unless I wanted to break up. Then Id make an issue.", "NAH ? Really? Like she is allowed to take whoever she wants but that doesn't make her any less of an asshole for not taking her partner of six years.", ">she excluded you from one of the most important days of her life.\n\nlol does anyone actually think this about graduation?

He\u2019s wondering if he\u2019s an asshole for feeling left out and hurt. Which doesn\u2019t make him an asshole. At all.", "Well said", "Also, do not take the initiative to give her any gifts", "Last May my partner graduated from his Master. The ceremony was in NY and we flew there for it. It was him, me, his parents and his brother. He was only allowed two tickets. His own parents decided that both his mom and I would use them.

Start reevaluating your relationship. Sorry dude.", "Don't let this fester. Don't put it off for another day after the graduation. Because she's say, why did you not say anything.\n\nTell her today how you feel, being left out.

Some people don\u2019t count partners as family until after marriage.", "You're not married yet though? Until you put a ring on it you aren't family and if we're going by time then her immediate family has been in her life a lot longer than 6 years", "Do you all live together?", "I always wonder how the other partner would react in a similar situation. Would she be okay with you not prioritizing her for your own family? A big talk is needed in any case.", "Dang that took a lot to not show emotion! Do you guys live together?", "NTA.\n\n6 years = YOU should be the priority. Not anyone else.\n\nThere's a reason this joke exists: What do you call a person who puts their family ahead of their significant other? Divorced.\n\nNow I know you guys aren't married but after 6 years you're not the priority in her life? I have a very strong feeling that she's more important to you than you are to her.\n\nSorry friend and I hope I'm wrong.", "My husband also only had two tickets because the ceremony was being held in a cathedral, and everyone agreed that they would be for me and his mother. In the end, he chose not to walk and just have his PhD mailed to him.", "Thank you. He says they've been \"dating\" for 6 years.  Nowhere does he say they live together. She may live at home or on her own. Maybe Uncle helped pay for her schooling.  A boyfriend is not family, I don't care how long you're dating.", "Don\u2019t do that. At 6 years, you should be a priority. You need to know that love is not enough. You are putting in more to the relationship than she is, she is not invested at all. Not only did you not get a ticket, she didn\u2019t even care to discuss it with you. NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve never understood the \u201cnot family\u201d stance. If not after 6 years, then when?

Why not have a conversation to atleast see where you stand if she sees a future with you etc?", "College graduations are so incredibly boring. They read a lot of names and you don't know who most of the people are. I work at a university and when they ask me to be part of the ceremony, I feel like I am being punished for something. \n\nWith that being said, I would still invite a significant other if I was walking and they wanted to go.", "I don\u2019t know about other people, but OP thought it was important enough to celebrate", "A boyfriend is different from a husband tho. You can communicate with her about your concerns. She may not think much about the graduation & it may be that she's family oriented or that's how they are as a family. Also, she didn't know about your surprise. It's not her fault. I get you, we wanna be petty sometimes that's why instead of asking if you can come to their celebratory dinner, you're waiting for her to ask you and you act distant/cold/dismissive. But she can't read your mind. You have to voice it out. NAH.", "There are potentially other aspects of this to consider. Did her uncle help her through school? Was he really supportive to her in her formative years? I'm not saying that you are wrong to be hurt, but not communicating how you feel and why is a bad idea. Don't sit and stew about it. Tell her. She also might be thinking of you. My graduation took foreeeeeever. Have you expressed in the past that you hate large crowds? Was your own graduation kind of chaotic and crazy crowded? Because whoa! That's overwhelming and annoying to some people. But unless you talk to her you won't know for sure what she's thinking. So before jumping to thinking the worst, hash it out with her.", "The issue is it shouldn\u2019t be a quid pro quo. The way you\u2019re talking about these gifts makes it sound like she owes you something in return. Give a gift, super generous or less so, but you don\u2019t get to expect anything in return. It feels a little too like you think you\u2019re owed a ticket because you spent a lot of money on the gifts you chose.", "It's reasonable not to propose for a while when going through things like schooling, him wanting to marry her in the \"near future\" considering she JUST graduated is a normal thing to do, plenty of couples wait especially when getting married can heavily alter your taxes/benefits/scholarships since you're combining incomes.", "What's stopping her from asking him?", "This occurred to me too.", "Op your feelings are valid. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being hurt at being excluded. And it doesn\u2019t even seem to me your upset about not going so much as her reason for not inviting you. I can\u2019t honestly say how I would feel if my SO of 6 years excluded me from an important event in their lives. But regardless I think you handled the situation well. Your title says you argued but it sounds to me like you swallowed how hurt you were and walked away. Maybe at a later date, after the graduation, you tell her how the whole thing hurt your feelings. I\u2019m not saying argue about it or demand an apology, but just tell her how it made you feel. That might help you get past it without any resentment building up.", "But you said the reason not being invited doesn't sit well with you is because of how much money you saved to buy her gifts, but if she doesn't know about the gifts, how does that reason factor into her decision/make sense?\n\nYou can totally be bummed that you spent a lot of $$$ on gifts, but I don't think you can be mad that she didn't invite you because of something that she doesn't know about (the existence of the gifts)", "I hope your punctuation in her final research paper was better that you\u2019re using here. Yikes.", "but did he ever talk to her about going before hand? he just assumed without talking to her. conversation is a two way street, just like she didn't tell him she only had enough tickets for inviting family, he never asked if he could go before making all these plans.", "Very close but not a father figure? Are you sur about that?", "6 YEARS??? I read 5 months and thought it was a little uncomfortable her response. 6 years is unacceptable to be saying family first which results in his exclusion.\n\nTime to have a serious discussion about this relationship", "We communicate openly. I read this AITA to him and my response. He respects and understands my response. Such is 16 years of clear understanding with your partner.", ">This is quite toxic.  \n>  \n>My advice would be to just leave, if after 6 years she doesn't consider you important enough to see her graduate then I think you deserve someone better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only toxic thing here is your advice lmao. There's no reason to tell him to break up with her without any context on how the rest of the relationship is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, do the healthy thing, and let her know how you feel. We don't know the full situation, so it's impossible for us to give you advice. Is she super close with her uncle? Maybe she doesn't care that much about her graduation, but she knows her family members do, so she chose them over having you there without knowing how much this meant to you.", "Like what am I supposed to do, cry? Be sad, nah I\u2019ll be good, it is what it is I can\u2019t change what\u2019s happened, it was just shocking, I\u2019m questioning whether or not her way of thinking suits me or not, that\u2019s it, I wanted to see other peoples perspectives", "If after 6 years your partner is not on that list then what are you doing with them ? Only hanging out when it\u2019s convenient?

They'll never be family? just roommates for 60 years in your eyes?\n\nHer family has been in her life for longer than 6 years, correct.. but you don't get to choose family, she has chosen to be with him for 6 years, why waste the guys time then?", "Very fair point! This is why one should always only date orphans or extremely old people who's close relatives have all died. You'll never be a priority for anyone with a *living* family, after all.", "That\u2019s not true at all I know people that have been together 20+ years.

Why? I think it would've been perfectly reasonable to prioritize family over a 5 month relationship. That wouldn't have been a big deal, someone she has only dated for a handful of months isn't like family and doesn't yet have a place in her life. 5 months is short enough that, if she was invited to a wedding, he likely wouldn't even be named on the invite and she might just get a +1 instead.\n\nThe length of this relationship is the key detail that makes her behaviour so discomforting. After 6 years, OP should be family and should have a place in her life.", "Yes, I'm sure he clearly understands that he's just not important enough to you to make the list.", "If you feel like crying, absolutely cry. Sadness is a valid emotion. You are allowed to feel disappointment and sadness that you\u2019re not going to her graduation. It\u2019s only going to hurt you in the long run to keep \u201ctaking it on the chin\u201d and burying your emotions.\n\nIf you want something actionable, you should absolutely talk to her, and without recriminations or accusations, be honest. \u201cIt genuinely hurt my feelings that you don\u2019t consider me family. Not inviting me is one thing, but that was particularly hurtful to me. I think of you as family, but it looks like we\u2019re not aligned on that front. I wanted to let you know how that made me feel.\u201d\n\nThis will allow you both to be honest and communicative about your expectations and give her the opportunity to explain her train of thought and hopefully apologize or at least show empathy for you. If she reacts with anger or dismissiveness, that would be a very serious red flag and indicative to the level of respect she has for you. But you\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t talk to her.

Or something else could've happened where she was forced to only invite family, we don't know and neither does OP so my biggest suggestion is not to take it to heart.", "OP didn't mention her father, so I'm guessing her uncle was a sub father or such", "That's what gets me about the whole thing.  She couldn't be bothered to tell her partner of 6 years that she can't get him a ticket for her graduation. Very telling.", "Some dude? You sound like someone whose never been in a relationship before. Would be he \"some lame dude\" if they were married? After all, that would be \"FaMiLy\" now would it?", "This was a super bad take.

Is she as serious about you as you are her? This is a bad sign and you have to advocate for yourself if you want to stay in this relationship.", "What got me was that you had to ask. She didn't even think of you. That tells me that she is not committed, and she doesn't view the relationship as one to last. That is my concern. So, take stock of how she views the relationship. And decide if you two are still compatible and still have the same goals. Then make your decision on what you want to do. It is okay to be hurt and disappointed.
