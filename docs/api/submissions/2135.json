The secretary thought you were being a typical irresponsible teen. You weren\u2019t. Your friend hasn\u2019t seen enough of life (and death) to understand the difference between an excuse and a reason.", "NTA. you showed equal amount of sass with that secretary. thats on her. it wasnt an \"excuse\" it was the truth, and your friend should learn a little more empathy", "You stood up for yourself with someone being shitty. \n\nYour friend is an asshat for suggesting it.\n\nIt's only been a month. Hugs.", "NTA honey it took me years not to tear up when someone would ask how my dad was doing. YEARS!!! Those first months let alone weeks are a blur!  It has been 15 years and still some days are tough!", "NTA. Your dad's death is an excuse! Or reason! Or explanation. Whatever you want to call it. And you're not procrastinating, you're grieving. Take your time and stay away from any toxic people that tell you to get over it/stop using it as an excuse etc", "NTA. Informing the secretary of a significant life event is by no means the same as using it as an *excuse.* You revealed a very valid *explanation.* Your friend was wrong.\n\nGive yourself some grace and space to deal with things beyond school. You\u2019re in a time where family and your grieving process is priority. You aren\u2019t a procrastinator or a slacker just because you haven\u2019t been able to meet your academic responsibilities on time. You have other things on your plate.", "NTA wtf it's not even an excuse, it's literally the truth", "NTA.  I don't think you did anything wrong either.  Your Dad died!  Your world was turned on its head unexpectedly AND your life has been changed irrecoverably.  Your friend needs a serving of sympathy.", "NTA your friend is the AH, the so-called friend has no empathy for you.", "NTA.  Most schools have \"compassionate withdrawl\" as an option/resource for bereavement.", "NTA. The secretary is used to kids with bad excuses or no excuse, so her default mode is strict, but she shouldn't have cut you off and talked over you. You told her the truth and gave her a chance to apologize, which she took. As a teacher, I occasionally make mistakes like that (though I don't think I'd talk over a student), and I definitely want to know when it happens so I can apologize and offer condolences.", "NTA. Your friend is. \n\nDeath of a parent is one of the most stressful life events we can endure. Sometimes it can take months or years to recover. Don't let anyone tell you how to grieve.", "NTA but your \u201cfriend\u201d definitely is", "NTA. I don't know how you can call this person a friend.", "NTA: tell your friend when their beloved pet or family member dies you'll be sure to feed that line back to them and to look forward to it.", "NTA\n\nNo you didn't do anything wrong but SHE did and was unprofessional as well.", "NTA at all! You are grieving and that woman was so incredibly rude.   \nShe is TA.", "NTA. You\u2019re grieving. She could have asked why was it late and if anything was going on in your life. I honestly would have went a step further and reared up while telling her the news.", "Your friend's an AH", "First off, massive condolences to you :( second, you\u2019re NTA, the secretary is a little bit the AH but not much as I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t expect that to be the reason.

I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nI understand the secretary's skepticism, many students may use \"family stuff\" reasoning as an excuse when they are late with filling in forms or handing in work. \"Family Stuff\" is an appropriate way of saying something serious is/has happened and you have had more pressing concerns without going into detail. Its better for all involved, its less uncomfortable that way. Having to go into that kind of detail makes everyone uncomfortable. Your \"friend\" clearly has never been in that situation and they're an AH for minimising your loss.\n\nMake people uncomfortable. Especially that friend.", "NTA.
