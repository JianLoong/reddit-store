My mil is like this. if it's time for someone else to be the center of attention she ignores them. She lives 10 minutes away and my husband had to drag her to visit the hospital and then she never came to visit or even chey in. Oh but she'd call my husband to take her grocery shopping and such because her car died. My husband stood up to her and said this was pretty messed up to ask him to take her everywhere when he's got a newborn and a wife recovering from a csection at home. She backed off but of course gave us the silent treatment until we invited her over three weeks later for my birthday. When our second was born she watched our daughter for two days but once my mom came in and watched daughter/ was there to help us settle in, we didn't see her till we brought the baby TO HER on mother's day 3 weeks later. (Yes, I was pissed that's how we spent mother's day but my husband hadnt learned back then to let her stew in her choices. Oh and then to top that encounter off we had also brought take away over to her house and when I asked if she wanted to give me the baby back so she could make herself a plate of food, she asked ME to just make her a plate..\n\nSo yeah, narcissists are gonna narcissist. Let her not come but keep your guard up when she tries to reenter so she doesn't cause you more drama.", "NTA for the situation as a whole, but soft YTA for telling your mom NOT to cancel her trip. I would have bolted up the house and put up signs in the yard they she was not welcome due to her lack of respect for your wife and newborn child.

Good thing she said she wasn\u2019t coming first.   Put you foot down and support your wife.", "So very NTA.    Your mom did you (and your wife) a huge favor.   Don't you dare apologize to her.  Go NC. You'll be happier in the long run. \nAnd congrats on your new little family unit.  Take too many pictures. Make lots of memories.  Fill out the whole baby book.

If not, I'd let mom muddle through figuring this out on her own. NTA.", "NTA but do not inflict your narcissistic, domineering mother on your poor wife. And under no circumstances should you allow your brother to come. Let your wife figure out breastfeeding without her in-laws around. She\u2019ll appreciate the privacy when she\u2019s bleeding into adult diapers, trying to navigate pooping with a torn perineum, and leaking breast milk everywhere (Sorry to be so graphic. I just wish we talked about the postpartum experience more). Parenthood is honestly one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done, but the first days after bringing baby home are some of the hardest. Your wife will be at her most vulnerable and so will you. This is not about your mother and her needs. It\u2019s about you, your wife and your wonderful tiny human as you start your life together.", "*it ends with her cancelling the trip altogether*\n\nThis is a huge *blessing*.

Like you said, it\u2019s just mentally exhausting to want to have a normal, adult relationship with my mother but constantly being met with these guilt trips and gaslighting into thinking I\u2019m being a shitty person.", "OP, NTA.\n\nWhere did OP say anything about his mother\u2019s help? He said she was visiting. Besides that, how would it be okay for his mother to invite his brother unless OP specifically asked her to on his behalf? If he wants his brother there, OP would surely invite him himself.", "Did you miss the part where they said they didn't really want her to come, and that they said yes to appease HER? The mother is the one entitled. She demanded to come right when the wife got out of the hospital, so the wife cannot just relax after squeezing out a baby, and invited his brother, ffs. She is going to be recovering from a serious medical procedure and probably have her boobs out a lot of the time pumping and breastfeeding. Shes going to be very vulnerable after having the baby, I doubt she wants to do that with an audience. It is absolutely not reasonable for the mother to assume the brother would be wanted there. Did anyone ask the wife, aka, the mother of the actual baby, what she was comfortable with, btw? Because I doubt it would be her brother in law seeing her in one of her most sensitive moments. I also don't think it would be a narcissist mother in law coming on the day she's released from the hospital to cause trouble and keep her from bonding with her new baby.", "Please tell me you\u2019re joking. \u201cFirst love\u201d? \u201cChoosing some random woman over her\u201d? Neither of these are true, nor do they make sense.\n\nBy and large, in this day and age, a man and woman (or any combination in between) only merry after spending considerable time together in order to find comparability in mentality, life goals, personality, and interests.

There are way too many people who would, so I had to ask, but you're doing it right.", "Okay. In that case, NTA for anything I've heard about so far. You were well within reason to shut your brother out because you hadn't invited him and your wife didn't want to deal with another person pushing their way into the house when she's recovering. And if that keeps your mother from coming, too... well, that's actually probably a good thing, since you and your wife never really wanted her there in the first place.", "Why would you subject your newly postpartum wife to that?", "YTA for wanting to subject your wife to that.", "You're not shitty - your mom is.  \n\nYou're protecting your wife and that's not shitty.", "Yes, I may have misinterpreted. When the OP said, \"we told her very early so she had ample time to plan,\" it seemed like he was implying that they needed her to come, and the dates she picked weren't what they had in mind. It's unclear when she would've been welcome to come.", "NTA I don\u2019t blame you for what you said.. stand your ground and keep standing up for your family if she comes around great if not oh well.. and for god sakes don\u2019t apologize!!", "NTA You should consider setting some boundaries here for the future.", "You don\u2019t have to worry.

He's lucky his wife didn't serve him divorce papers over it.\n\nOP, your mother will not be a help to your wife, she will be a guest for whom your wife has to provide food and cleaning. (And I'm sure you believe that you, not your wife, would be doing all that work -- but I am... sceptical that would actually be the case.)\n\nThe first 3 months after the birth, your wife's body will still be healing from a traumatic medical event. Her hormones and emotions are going to be all over the place. She will be constantly exhausted from having to care for the baby.

Not at all. No. Nada.", "NTA, and I noticed that even now after your mother\u2019s terrible behaviour, you are worried about your mother\u2019s feelings.
