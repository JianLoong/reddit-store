He doubled down saying he was just poking fun it wasn't a big deal, and I should not make a scene. I said I was leaving and he could stay and talk to my ex if he wanted I didn't care.

He never should have talked about private things like that with your ex or anyone really.I assume he said those things because he had had too much to drink and because he was talking to your ex and wanted to show how well he knew you to prove a point that you were his now.

Sorry you went through this.", "NTA. \n\nThere\u2019s a time and place to discuss things and this wasn\u2019t one of them. \n\nYour husband has two hands, maybe he can use them to pull his head out his arse.", "NTA, as a bloke, he should know the devastating blow ED can cause on mental health and to make jokes about it and you to your ex, and now everyone will gossip etc\n\nHe seriously needs to make it up to you\n\nBy the way, best get your testosterone levels checked, 1 in 4 men 30+ drastically lose testosterone level, couple % a year. Effects everything. Suggest getting a good testosterone booster and hopefully get that tree growing again", "NTA. Wow your husband is a dick!  A major asshole. Violated your privacy and trust. \n\nOn a side note, if you haven\u2019t you should get your prostate checked.  You\u2019re very young to have some ED. while it could be stressed induced, better safe than sorry.", "NTA\n\nWhat an inappropriate conversation to be having... With anyone.... anywhere. I don't care what anyone says, having a conversation about your sex life with another person without the permission of the SO is gross. Weird AF too since it's your ex....

When my ex was in town, we'd meet up with him for dinner, and I talked to him almost daily via text.\n\nIn all that time, with all those opportunities, not once did either of them have a conversation that went anywhere near what your husband and ex were discussing. Any embarrassing stories were stupid, high school bullshit stories that never involved anything so intimate.\n\nI don't know why anyone thinks that sharing information like this with anyone is okay. It's disrespectful and rude. Your private life is called that for a reason. It's not for public consumption.\n\nYour husband owes you an apology. Your ex has no obligation to you, but your husband should have shut that conversation down immediately.\n\nYour spouse is meant to be your partner, not the person that talks shit about you and shares your private shit with anyone that will listen.", "That's a good tip, I find it really hard. My husband is more masc, and more dominance so I often take the more soft role", "Like babe I I want my dick to work just as bad as you lol can you chill\n\nI think my ex was flirting a bit too and he was enjoying the banter", "I think he feels embarrassed about his behavior too. But I also know he struggles with my ED he wants me to perform more - so I think he's struggling", "Lol", "Also I'm so dumb I had fantized they would hit it off and we would all hook up, turns out they were just making fun of me cuz I'm bad at sex lol", "Honestly it was sorta a fun flirty conversation I think they were enjoying the flirt. \n\nAlso my husband has been having a hard time dealing with my ed, and I think was enjoying letting off steam about it and I get it, but do it with your friends not my ex?", "We definitely talk about how it's ok to share things with our friends in private with them, but not in public or in a mocking way.", "Thank you! Very kind words, I'm still really struggling", "Yeah it was honestly very out of character for him, he is usually quite respectful and I'm the one who maybe cracks a nastyer joke. \n\nWe had never had this type of fight before so I feel like we didn't know how to resolve it", "Thanks", "Lol I think your a porn not?", "Oh no you think me it's me?", "Would you like it if someone talked about your sexual issues?", "What is ESH?", "Any idea what to do if he dosn't?", "NTA value yourself mor and find someone who respects and cares for you.", "Oh my god that makes it worse. Yuck. The thought of your man flirting with your ex. That\u2019s beyond the pale. You poor man.", "And he feels like the way to make that happen was to make fun of you with an ex partner of yours and compare notes on your sexual performance. \n\nDoes he do this with other aspects of your life and relationship to make you feel small? I'm not giving him a pass for being drunk, especially if weeks down the line he still refuses to accept that his behaviour was appalling", "I\u2019m feeling like there is mixed signals now. So, you considered having sex with both of them? Well, then I guess he ( your ex) would have found out anyway.", "Yeah venting with your mates is one thing. Discussing details like that with your person's ex, who you've just met, in a place where other people can overhear is over the line for me. And him yelling that you're a baby and should grow up, then not apologising? That's gross.\n\nI don't consider being half drunk (or even fully drunk) an excuse, but you'd think if someone acted badly and hurt someone they profess to love whilst in that state, they'd be absolutely mortified and keen to apologise once they sobered up. Ugh.\n\nI'm sorry this happened. It's shitty.", "Oh my goodness. Now your making excuses for him. No no no. Please.", "Sorry I was a little blunt with that. I think you both were in the wrong he shouldn't have talked about with your ex if he wanted to talk about it he shoulddo so with his friends, but I think calling it a betrayal was way extreme.", "I would love it because I am not a fucking wimp.", "Everyone sucks here.", "Well, I am one who would be mortified if my husband stormed out clearly angry at me. Absolutely mortified. Sometimes we can\u2019t see past our own emotions to arrive at empathy, and you may need to take the high road and apologize for how you departed the event. \n\nIf he can\u2019t reciprocate an apology you will need counseling. Your feelings are valid and you had every right to be hurt.", "I'm not saying it was flirting like all the way, just a slightly flirty convo", "It was just a fantasy, if would never really happen", "Thank you for your thoughts this honestly sums up how I feel really well", "Omg I'm trying not to", "So you don't think he humiliated me? Or broke trust?", "Confusing take\u2026", "Ooo ok I think we got to the bottom of it here", "This is a little aggressively shitty. Where is this coming from?", "You don't think my feelings are justified? Like I should have just taken it and brought it up later?", "No I don't think he did, to me it just sounds like your husband has a good sense of humor. my father had a sense of humor like that so maybe I'm just used to it.", "Ooo ok I think you couldn't go more than three replies from me before you start crying. Want to start?", "Don't over think it. Some people need to be told the wold does not spin around them sometimes. AITA would be better if people took the gloves off sometimes.", "Your feelings are justified, but screaming at a wedding is not. You can bring it up without the noise.", "Dang I hope you have higher standards for relationships in the future", "There is nothing funny about mocking your partner (for something they can\u2019t control) to their ex. People who do that are terrible partners and should hope they never find themselves in a shitty situation like that.", "No but I feel like you should. You have a lot of anger for like no reason babe. No wonder your alone", "But what if they had kept going what do you think I should have done?", "Swing and a miss. I'm sitting with my feet in the pool while the wife is sleeping after having too much wine. It's Saturday, so why not?\n\n\n*You* however have a grossly sick sense of self envolment that makes you think you can have an opinion on anything.\n\n\nLet me guess: You throw shade at others to make yourself feel better?
