Smoking it makes it so tender.  \n\nI made tortillas from scratch as well.  \n\nWe had our party and everyone enjoyed the food.  Until my wife's brother's girlfriend asked for the recipe.  I declined because it was my family recipe and I don't like to give away recipes. I have in the past and I end up getting crapped on because it doesn't taste as good and I must have sabotaged them on purpose.  No Madison I didn't sabotage you. You used cinnamon powder in your chili instead of a couple of cinnamon sticks like I said.  \n\nMy wife told me to please play nice and share.  So I wrote out the recipe for the girl.  \n\nShe immediately starts dry heaving like she is going to hurl.  My brother-in-law comes over to see what's going on. She screams that I served dog food for supper.  \n\nSo everyone starts asking what she means and she starts waving the recipe around and saying that beef cheeks and tongues are what she buys for dog snacks. \n\nNo one else complains. They all say she is being ridiculous and that the meal was great.  \n\nShe is left there crying and being comforted by my brother-in-law.  \n\nNow she is flaming me on Facebook calling me names and saying that just because I ate peasant food growing up is no reason to feed it to others.  \n\nI feel kind of guilty because I thought I was doing a nice thing making authentic food.

And she\u2019s just advertising her own ignorance by blasting you on FB.", "NTA I'll admit that I (vegetarian) am actually a bit surprised that people eat tongue and cheeks but calling it peasant or dog food when everyone (including her) enjoyed it seems needlessly entitled.", "NTA. A really nice local hotel serves slow cooked beef cheeks and they're devine.", "American here. It's perfectly edible meat. I was raised to eat as much of the animal as possible so that the life wouldn't be wasted, and there's nothing wrong with those cuts.", "NTA. This is a wildly racist take from this woman and she sucks. I'm baffled by this as you can find lengua and barbacoa at literally any taco stand in the US. This is super common food in all of the states I've lived in. These are not uncommon cuts for tacos at all. Please tell me your brother in law ended things with her after this.", "NTA. This woman has weird food issues. Everyone else agrees that the food tasted good. So did she, until she encountered her weird hangups about cheek and tongue.", "NTA - Does she find beef kidney and liver also peasant food? The more she complains about tongue and cheek meat, the higher your reputation as a cook rises on FB.", "NTA. Cow tongue is considered a delicacy, and costs more per pound than beef brisket in many areas. She's just ridiculously insulated from reality. Your recipe sounds delicious!", "NTA at all. The brother's girlfriend sounds a bit picky and stuck-up about their food.   \n\n\nHowever, to help alleviate situations like this in the future, I would take the time to explain to guests, \"Hey, i'm making x food, which is made from y meat.

That lady is elitist, ridiculous, and *obviously* a miserable cook. She can go pound sand.", "NTA she's completely unreasonable. Plenty of Americans will eat that too and do eat that. I'm vegetarian so not on my menu but meat is meat honestly. Dogs eat all kinds of human food also so unless she's gonna freak out over every ingredient a dog can eat that is also served to humans she's just acting like a fool.", "NTA.  She is being overly dramatic.  While those cuts are not typical in a lot of people's diets, they are not bad, just different.  A good barbacoa makes them delectable.  I'd tell her to blow it out her overly entitled, aristocratic butt.", "NTA and she\u2019s a classist person.\n\nEdited to add, not just classist but I\u2019m betting she\u2019s a racist.", "NTA, does your SIL find mayonnaise too spicy?", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds ignorant.

People need to get past the perfect pink or red circles on the Styrofoam tray.", "NTA. Many popular cuts for certain dishes actually began as cheap cuts because it was \u201cfood for the poor\u201d - even lobster and oysters used to be poor food. Food is food!", "NTA. Lengua is readily available here in America because people eat it. Lengua tacos with homemade tortillas sounds delicious and your guests were lucky that you cooked them such a wonderful meal.\n\nSounds like wife's brother's girlfriend is no longer invited to the house. She was incredibly rude and disrespectful. You cooked for her and she insulted you and your culture, then continued to do so online. She should be utterly ashamed of herself, and wife's brother should be ashamed of bringing her into your home.", "NTA\n\nThe meat you chose may be peculiar but it's perfectly normal and sound yummy too (actually I'd like to know the recipe \ud83d\ude04).

Would love that. \n\nHow about sharing the recipe?", "NTA \n\nBeef cheeks and tongue are perfectly good cuts of meat, and were ideal for the dish you made. They\u2019re not standard meat cuts in US cuisine but they\u2019re tasty and perfectly fine for consumption. You graciously prepared a home cooked meal for your guests, and she clearly enjoyed the taste. If she had some arbitrary aversion to certain foods, she should have let you know before eating at your house. In this case, it seems like she\u2019s just ignorant and has a poorly developed palate.

You can find lengua tacos at just about any taco stand in my town. You didn't serve anything disgusting. She loved it until she found out what part of the cow she was eating. The only disgusting part of this story is the ungrateful guest who enjoyed your hospitality and then talked crap about your tasty food.", "She's an idiot who doesn't know about food", "Lengua is the BEST. Can I come over?? NTA", "The meet you bought isn't disgusting imo - nta\n\nShe's a major ah and racist.", "INFO: c'mon you gotta tell us the recipe. At least a vague little hint", "NTA, she got what she asked for.", "Absolutely NTA. It sounds like your meal was delicious and most people enjoyed it - just because she thinks it's peasant food doesn't mean it is.  \n\n\nMy father's parents were ukranian and he had to get alot of shit for what the ate in post-WWII germany. Today some of the things they ate are considered delicacies you need to pay a nice price for if you want to eat it. That is, if you find anyone who can prepare it.  \n\n\nBeef tongue isn't everyone's thing I admit, but it's mostly in your mindset wether or not you'd enjoy it.

Especially because these meat cuts are completely normal.", "NTA! Those tacos sound great!", "NTA\n\nThe one person who had a fit about it is the AH.  \n\nEvery part of a beef has food quality.  Just because that one person buys that cut for her dogs doesn't mean everyone does.", "NTA - that sounds delicious! Sorry you had to host such an rude guest", "NTA, total over reaction. She liked it till she new it was \"peasant food\". How insulting to you, the host. She is rude.", "NTA. In addition to just general ridiculousness, this girl reeks of racism and classism.", "NTA.   Hope she doesn't eat bologna.  Or hot dogs.", "NTA.  It wasn\u2019t disgusting food.  Besides, plenty of dogs get fed human grade meat/ meals.", "As soon as I saw barbacoa I knew you werent the asshole lol. NTA. OMG. Im a picky person but I have an old friend who is Mexican and she made barbacoa tacos one day and they were soooo fucking delicious. Then she told me what it was(she knew not to do it before I ate lol) and I was like eww....but that shit was delicious so fuck it. Sometimes its the thought of what theyre eating rather than how it tastes.", "NTA\n Beef cheeks are very tasty and often served in very nice restaurants.", "NTA\n\nShe's being ridiculous. There are still plenty of Americans who eat beef tongue (and other organs). And calling it \"peasant food\" is stupid too, there are tons of popular American foods eaten today that started out as \"peasant foods\".", "NTA she's got weird hangups about delicious cuts of meat", "NTA. Next time tell the entitled witch that it\u2019s beef cheeks and tongue even when it\u2019s not. All the more leftovers for you and good tacos for everyone else.", "Seriously. Am American, I vote NTA and please share.", "Do you really think she has knowingly ever eaten offal?", "I have literally seen each and every one of them eat barbacoa tacos at a restaurant.  Barbacoa is made from a cows head.", "I'm from Guatemala. I guess she is from Oregon, I never asked.  All of us are professionals of some sort or another. My wife's family is from Portland.", "Honestly this is so funny to me. Animal meat is animal meat. I don\u2019t think one should be considered grosser (based on cut, not actually taste/preparation) or more \u201cwrong\u201d to eat cuz that\u2019s what it comes down to. I\u2019ve always been of the belief all meat is ok or all meat isn\u2019t. (I personally switched to no meat but you do you) acting like deer is somehow more wrong or more gross to eat than cow or something is silly. It\u2019s usually based on animals see more, take pictures of in the wild, or have as pets.\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately arbitrary and hypocritical. She liked it til it was deer\n\nDefinitely NTA and barbacoa is super delicious. People give all types of cuts of meat to their dogs. My dogs eat plenty of the healthy cuts that are extremely common for humans to eat.", "Simmer the tongue for two hours. Then the tough outer layer comes off really easy. Then smoke it with  mellow chillies and onions and garlic.  Seriously that simple for the tongue.  It just takes a long time.", "Yeah. Tbh she sounds completely ignorant to how animals are are \u2018used for food\u2019. Im sure she\u2019s had sausage before and eaten various parts of a cow.", "Yeah ignore this.  She was just ridiculous.  As if meat from a pig's ass is somehow more fit for consumption than meat from their cheeks.", "So she\u2019s a closet racist insinuating based on your upbringing you \u201cate peasant food\u201d. That comment alone says enougu", "i guess i'm just confused as to why she has an issue with being served \"peasant food\" when tacos are peasant food to begin with?", "That comment really disgusted me. Like wtf does that mean you snob?!", "It's because she's racist."]}
