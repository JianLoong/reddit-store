Bf doesn't have the most experience with dogs but I spend a lot of time with dogs and he has met and spent time with a fair few of them with me. The dog in question here is a lab so fairly big/strong. The one thing this dog loves more than anything is fetch/chasing balls, so we'd had him at the beach throwing the ball for him and when it was time to leave he didn't want to let go of the ball so I just put his leash on and let him carry the ball home in his mouth, which he's done countless times before.\n\nAs we were walking back, we came across some food somebody had dropped on the ground and the dog dropped the ball to try and eat the food. I was trying to drag him away but it was a struggle as he was fixated on the food. Finally I got his attention and encouraged him away from the food but just as he left the food my bf called his name to get his attention and then kicked his ball up the path infront of us. The dog obviously bolted after it but he was on the leash and I wasn't expecting it so didn't have my feet planted and he almost pulled me off my feet. Luckily I reacted quickly and managed to plant my feet and pull the leash back, but the material of the leash did slip through my hand and leave painful burns on my palm (I did have the handle of the leash wrapped round my wrist so thankfully there was no chance of me dropping it and the dog getting away).\n\nI was furious and asked bf what the hell he did that for. He said he was just trying to get the dog away from the food. I told him that was clearly not the way to do it as it would obviously end badly and could've ended so much worse than it did. He's lucky I reacted quickly and had the leash wrapped round my wrist or I could've been pulled over or have the leash slip out of my hand and the dog get away. I know he's not experienced but I couldn't believe he couldnt see how that could end super badly, and I told him so. He was just shrugging his shoulders and that angered me even more. No apologies for causing me injury, no acknowledgement of how dangerous or careless it was, no \"ok I won't do it again\", no nothing. I asked him what he'd have done if the dog pulled me over and I cracked my head on the pavement and became seriously injured/died. He just shrugged again and said \"but you didn't tho\"\n\nWe didn't speak for the rest of the day and now I'm wondering if I was too harsh on him bc I know he doesn't have a lot of experience with dogs.

He knows that the dog will run after the ball and thats what happens and was obviously exactly what he wanted what happened.\n\n\nI would confront him why dont want to apologize and if he really think he didnt anything wrong in bringing you and the dog in danger", "NTA. It was a thoughtless thing for him to do, but to then shrug it off and not offer any kind of apology or accept responsibility \n is him truly being an AH. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. If he's new to dogs, it's his responsiblity to learn FAST how dangerous a big dog can be, and how to work on minimizing that", "NTA. It sounds like a stressful moment for you, because you were aware of how badly things could have gone. Your bf didn't follow the same thought process, so it may have seemed to him like you were catastrophising.\n\nIt sounds like you're hurt by what you're interpreting as disregard for your injury + the risk he put you in. When your emotions have settled, go and talk to him about that aspect.", "NTA. But I can understand his reasoning aswell. He doesn't have that much experience with dogs and I assume he doesn't realize quite how strong a bigger dog can be. He probably didn't think it could pull you off your feet. And if you start yelling or being angry at him I presume he was likely a bit too intimidated to respond and apologise immediately. Hence why the shrug. It also probably doesn't help you berated him for doing the wrong thing in that instance.\n\nI don't think either of you are the asshole here. Seems all of this could be resolved if you 2 just talked it out and both apologized.", "NTA - but then you've painted your BF to be a real moron, haven't you.", "NTA but what do you expect him to do? Beg for your forgiveness? You didn\u2019t fall or get any REAL injury. He made a mistake while trying to help and you yelled at him for it. He could\u2019ve said sorry but it\u2019s not that deep to hold a grudge. In his eyes you probably over exaggerated. As a dog sitter you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when a dog does dog things. Your bf was just trying to help. If you think a dog can pull you down and possibly kill you. You shouldn\u2019t be taking the dog outside.", "Honestly you should not have a dog you cannot control. YTA", "You probably spooked him", "YTA. He was just trying to help. Even someone familiar with dogs could do thing like that with an impulse, not to mention not experienced. \n\nHe may be little little AH cause he could say sorry etc, but  after Your reaction I cant blame him. Poor guy just wanted to help and get shouted on, even tho nothing too serious happened.\n\nSometimes im working with others physically - shit happens, sometimes others hit You with things randomly, or situation becomes dangerous cause of stupid mistakes, but I cant blame others. They are not doing it intentionally, we are all trying to avoid things like those, but sometimes its just mix of bad luck/wrong decision. That's how it is in sports, work, driving car, life basically.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
