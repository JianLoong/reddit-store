Look for mirrors and blackout covers or curtains. Specifically mirrors though.  Even ones that aren't perfect, but are cheap will work. \n\nYou can put up the mirrors in the windows to shine the light back into their own property and put the blackout covers over the windows on that side to block all of the light. \n\nYou can get large sheets of blackout material for pretty cheap on Amazon. I had to do that when we took down a hurricane shutter that used to provide privacy and shade in one of our large rooms with big windows and as a temporary solution until the new shutter was built and installed. \n\nSearch Amazon for \"Vanten 2023 Upgraded Portable Blackout Curtains\".  I paid $24 for a large one that spanned the entire window, but if you have smaller windows you can get smaller sizes or you can cut a large one down to fit multiple smaller windows. \n\nYou can also get a roll of privacy fence or construction screen and mount  poles at the corners of your fence  and stretch the privacy screen between the poles, above your own fence. Depending on how long the run is, you might want 1 or more poles in the middle to help hold up the privacy screen so it doesn't sag. \n\nThe privacy screen can add 4+ feet or more of height above your fence to help block the light and provide more privacy for your yard.\n\nSince the privacy screen is a temporary install and not the same as an actual wood or vinyl fence, there shouldn't be issues with the height.", "\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe", "Thank you for that last part.
