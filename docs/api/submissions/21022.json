In my culture (Maori) we wear a cloak called a korowai (or a kakahu) on special occasions. These cloaks are \\*steeped\\* in meaning, right down to the colour. A green korowai can represent life (or someone who saves lives. I have a green cloak because I work in a paramedicine service as a Chaplain). As a culture we are inherently spiritual.\r  \n\r  \nOur culture is very complicated to engage with. We are indigenous, and so my non-Maori friends find it to be a bit of a minefield. I do my best to support them because they have genuine hearts for our people. I don't ever get offended when my friends are trying to navigate this journey, I understand the complexities of it. \r  \n\r\r  \n\rWhen I told my groomsmen I'd be providing and blessing (a compulsory aspect of our culture when it comes to what we call \"taonga\" or treasures is they must be blessed) them with korowai to wear on the day they were all over the moon. You have to be gifted a korowai, and they wouldn't have the opportunity. To me this was spiritually symbolic of their journey with me, and having my friends in our korowai on my wedding day is deeply important to me.\r  \n\r  \nMy partner is very passionate about my culture, but she is not Maori. When I told her I was letting them choose their own korowai that we'd pay for, she was initially fine with it. When we discussed it with one of the groomsmen she got upset when I said \"And they're choosing their own korowai, including colour, and matching their outfit with the korowai by wearing shades underneath\". She said it would look \"shoddy and mis-matched in photos\". She said that the korowai all had to be the same colour, and that the suits had to be matching. I reinforced to her the importance of the colours of a korowai (for example if you \\*are\\* Maori you typically wear the colours of your tribe or that represent who you are) but she said I must choose a matching korowai for all of them, and they have to wear black suits underneath. Her concern was looking \"rag tag\" for the photos.\r  \n\r  \nWhen my Maori best man heard this (he was not at the initial heated conversation) he very politely voiced his discomfort to me, and said he'd rather not wear our traditional cloaks if it was dictated to him what he was wearing (because it betrays his own relationship with our culture, and the people of our culture). This put me at an impasse. Not because I see it as her vs him (they get along really well) but because I respect his outlook on our culture, and the significance of this kind of thing in it.\r  \n\r  \nWe're now at a stand off. She has said its absolutely not happening, I have said it absolutely is happening. I want to know if I'm being the AH for standing my ground on this, or whether I should just back down.", "created_utc": 1688176956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nir82/aita_for_wanting_my_groomsmen_to_wear_my/", "score": 1585, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you look back at these photos it won\u2019t be to see what is coordinating, it won\u2019t be about what people wore at all but it will be to see the people that you love and reminiscing the day and the celebration of your life. You don\u2019t get married so that you can have pictures, you do it to join two people who love each other and want their lives tied together.

I would seriously consider sitting down with her, and telling her how her \u201cpreferences\u201d and refusal to budge on her opinions for a purely visual reason makes you, and your other groomsman, feel.

I can say to her hey I want to throw a party on some random day and l want to set a green theme but I can't cherry pick bits of her tradition and ignore other aspects.\n\nLike if she's Christian, you can't just say hey can you get the priest to wear a suit like the groomsmen, so it looks nice and matching for the photos. If you want a wedding in a church, you're getting married by a priest. You can't just hire the church and do your own thing. \n\nThis should be the same for you, if you're bringing your culture in then she needs to respect it.

She doesn't understand that your friends aren't going to 'cosplay', it's not about how it's going to look on the photos, and groomsmen aren't mere 'extras' in a wedding. They are there because they are important to you and you want them to hold a special place in your life. And by the way I think that you wanting to 'bless' them and honoring them with traditional garbs that hold such a deep meaning for you, is so much more meaningful than what we habitually see during weddings.\n\nI mean, I live in Japan... Here they hire 'white' actors to play priests during 'christian' wedding ceremonies...  \n\n\nWe're soooo far away from people who would 'gatekeep' their religion and culture. It's so much more than sharing. I envy the people who have unique chance to count between your friends.

I am seriously side eying your fiance for being disrespectful towards your culture and cultural garments because she wants a certain aesthetic.", "NTA\n\nIt's quite apparent to people not inside your circle just how important your culture and the meaning behind the cloaks is to you, and if the main person INSIDE can't see this and respect it because to her they will look \"shoddy and mismatched in photos\" then you have to ask yourself if someone who is willing to dismiss your beliefs so easily is someone you can spend the rest of your life with.\n\nIf it was me and I had something that I felt this strongly about then this is ABSOLUTELY the hill I'd be willing to die on.", "Definitely NTA, as a kiwi this sounds bloody cool.

People saying our language is pointless to learn because our country is predominantly English speaking, and that Maori is being forced on people.

Passionate about the subject. They have no intentions of incorporating serial killers into their lives, though. \n\nI'm not saying \"leave,\" and I wouldn't. This doesn't sound like it's a threat to life or limb. Also, I don't know you, or her, or your relationship. This is all you, brother. That said, I myself would take a step back were I in your shoes, and review the situation. Specifically, I'd reexamine the alignment of values. \n\n--She's passionate about your culture, but she's MORE passionate about colors matching for photos. Photos are more important to her than your culture being properly represented at YOUR wedding. It's not just her wedding. It's a joining ceremony. It's the two of you, and your heritage plays second fiddle to her color scheme for photos. What about your guys' future kids? Is anything about them going to be less important to her than color schemes? And if your culture doesn't rate at the same level as color schemes, this might be difficult. \n\n--Your culture is \"shoddy and mis-matched\" because your culture puts importance on the individual, apparently (I'm just learning about it here,so please correct me if I'm wrong - I'm very interested in learning about this). Each individual - representing themselves by color - stands together united - by type of uniform - demonstrating how strong the individuals make the group. I think that's gorgeous, myself. Again, I may be completely wrong, it's just what I see from your words right here. \n\n**And if you read this, OP, I collect traditional recipes from every culture I can, comfort foods that Grandmothers cooked. Everyone loves food, and it makes me happy to bring a little bit of everyone's comfort into my home. The recipes, ingredients, and flavors may be different, but they're all good, and all comforting.

She's making the common mistake of focusing on the *aesthetic* of a wedding at the expense of the *heart* of the wedding.

By definition if everyone is wearing different colours, it would look coordinated and meaningful that they're wearing different colours. Someone else brought up the graduation ribbon colour scheme and it's the same thing. The meaning and aesthetic beauty is in the fact that the colours are different. Her not being able to understand that is concerning. Beyond that, I would say that black suits under the cloak seems like a fine enough compromise so you would get some level of visual simplicity (some people think colour on colour is tacky), but I really don't think it should even need to come to that. \n\nIn googling what the korowai look like, there seem to be different styles and none of them really look eye-catching at all.

Why are you insisting that their suits underneath be coloured too? It seems like having them stay true to the meaning of the korowai (by wearing the colour appropriate for each groomsman) while wearing a coordinated suit colour would be the obvious solution - this would respect your colour while also keeping some aesthetic coordination.\n\nAlternatively, will she have the same number of bridesmaids as you will groomsmen? If so, can you ask her if her bridesmaids will look good in the various colours of the korowai? Assuming they would, they can be paired with your groomsmen in a way where each of their dresses ties in with his korowai.\n\nTbh I understand her concern. I would *really* dislike what you described. It sounds like an absolute jumble of colour - I would find it very distracting and lacking cohesion. I wouldn't want my wedding day to look like a disorganized mess! I'd want us to look like a wedding party that's meant to be standing together, not a random assortment of people.

I've seen people wear Korowai when graduating uni, and they are visually *stunning*, not to mention the mana they portray. And I honestly couldn't imagine saying \"no\" to something so steeped in symbolism. Most western weddings are variations of the same, so it's incredibly special to have something *this special* as part of yours.\n \nOne thing I always appreciated growing up in a bi-cultural family was the full acceptance by my \"western\" parent of the culture of my other parent. There was never any conflict on that front. So, if you two have talked about having kids in the future, for their sake *please* make sure you're on the same page *now*. Will your kids be multi-lingual (te Reo, Afrikaans, and English)? Will they be raised with values/traditions etc from both sides of the family? Is there likely to be any pushback on that from either of your extended families, and if there is how will you manage that as a united team?\n\nThere are so many ways to incorporate different colours of Korowai into the overall wedding/wedding party colour scheme (e.g. subtle variations in bridesmaid bouquets/hair accessories, lots of colour in general to mix it all together, or conversely having a very simple colour palette for the bridesmaids, matching colours through the reception dinner centrepieces, etc etc - the possibilities really are endless). \n\nIt might be that your fiance had a particular vision for the wedding that she's trying to hold on to, but remind her that it's *your* wedding too.

She might need a bit of time to adjust her vision, and that's fair, but I hope she'll come around (and if it's purely an aesthetic thing for her, that she'll realise that some things simply are *important*, and that loving and committing to someone with their own cultural background means *accepting* that culture as part of her life too).

Definitely important things to talk about now before marriage, similar to how couples with different religions need to figure out where their expectations are regarding how to raise their kids (in the context of religion/their religious beliefs). Probably the most important thing to remember is that there isn't \"one, right way\" to merge your family, as every couple (and family they create, regardless of whether they have kids or not) will be unique. So it's really about finding what are the things that are important to each of you from your respective cultures (not just for your wedding, but for your marriage and your future together), and figuring out how those things can either co-exist, each be respected/practiced, and/or moulded together for something new and unique to your family (and specific traditions might fit better with one of those approaches whilst others might fit other approaches - family meals can be a good \"fusion\" example). \n\nThe worst thing you can do together is not be on the same page about respecting the other's culture, and to bring children into the world who end up feeling like their mixed heritage of cultures are constantly \"at war/in competition\" with each other due to it being a repetitive point of contention between their parents (i.e. you and your fiance). Having come from a home where my cultural identify of mixed heritage was always at peace, I can tell you that (should you choose to have them) kids will *definitely* pick up on that, and be impacted by it. And given the very unfortunate presence of racism in our society, they don't need to be dealing with that lack of cohesion at home. Home *has to be* their sanctuary from the world, regardless of what they're dealing with.\n\nObviously if you're not wanting to have kids then that's less of an issue, but if you're not on the same page about your respective cultures having sacred space within the life you build together, then it will most likely lead to resentment (which is the undoing of *many* marriages). \n\nBut yea, talk some more together about the cultural significance and meaning, and give her a bit of time afterwards to process her feelings (which are ok for her to have, but not ok to hurt/disrespect you with). Hopefully you'll figure it all out together.\n\nAnd, merging families can have its challenges at the best of times. Throw in different backgrounds (cultural, religious, financial/class, etc) and it can immediately multiple the number of those challenges, as well as increase the challenge factor! Not every couple can work through those challenges successfully, but if you're both able to hold space for the other's culture within your relationship, without asking the other to compromise *who they are* with their cultural identity and values, then it's definitely possible for you both to succeed as a team and wh\u0101nau.\n\nGoodluck \ud83d\ude0a", "That typo was a real gas \ud83d\ude0e", "I appreciate that.

When I think of our wedding pics those are the ones I think of.", "Yeah wedding photos are super overrated. They are not an important part of the life you are building together. Celebrate, but for crying out loud don't overthink or overspend on a wedding. Within a year the wedding photos will be relegated to the archives of memory except one or two you might hang on the wall. Within 5 years you'll have completely stopped seeing them. If you have kids you'll take down wedding photos to put up photos of the kids. Half of marriages end in divorce, and then the photos are junk. Make happy memories, not artistic photos. Or do a photo shoot separately with whatever costumes you like later.", "Yes, but this solution isn't offensive to the grooms culture.\n\nEdit: there are also ways to coordinate colors that might otherwise be clashing, by using specific shades, etc. Whoever they're having make the cloaks surely will have enough knowledge of how colors work together to be able to put together a palette that isn't an eyesore.", "So?

Great people but scary motherfuckers when they\u2019re mad or you\u2019re opposite them on the pitch.", "No, see... What you gotta' do is get six grooms-men and have each of them cosplay as a member of Noble Team.

It looked fantastic", "I understand where you are coming from, but she has a culture also. You both have cultures and expectations of a wedding. You guys need to have a way to do both. Part ceremony in your culture and part in hers. I understand the English tried to wipe out indigenous cultures. As a white Australian im horrified by that. But i sometimes feel that we are expected to always push our own cultural norms aside to respect others cultures. So she has a culture also. But that said, i don't get why she cares about the photos that much. As long as everyone is having a great time, and enjoying themselves then who cares. Thats said, i was made to wear fake tan as a bridesmaid so a friends photos looked good. I was horrified that she thought my skin colour was offensive.

The men choosing their own based on special meaning sounds like the color is going to be what it is and they can't just change the shade or make it match with another's choice.  Not saying groom is an AH for wanting it this way but the bride isn't one either for wanting her wedding to look a certain way likely based on how she's been imaging it for years.   Truthfully best advice is they have 2 ceremonies 1 with his traditional culture and 1 more western modern style to suit the bride.   Or decide they have inherent cultural differences and not get married at all", "And why does a subjective aesthetic give her the right to dictate what another culture looks like?", "Same for.me.

How? Some photos with his cultural clothing, and then some with hers. What\u2019s wrong with that?", "Two ceremonies is also twice as expensive, my dude. Also, the \"how she's been imagining it for years\" thing is bullshit. I went to a women's college and literally none of my friends had any kind of elaborate vision of their weddings.

Yes, it's traditional in western wedding for the wedding party to match,  but that has no particular meaning beyond the aesthetic \"same is harmonious\" idea, while in OP's culture different colours actually have a specific significance. Also, OP didn't ask her to dress her bridesmaids in colours according to his culture, he isn't trying to impose his traditions on her. If two people from different cultures are getting married, it makes sense to blend traditions when you can, and in this case it's so easy, each chooses what their own attendants wear.

If she truly does understand that the colors of the gifted garments to be worn by your groomsmen are a spiritual observation of your culture, and she in fact wants to marry you in a spiritual ceremony rather than simply wanting to set up an aesthetic photo op, then this isn\u2019t even something she should be trying to push. \n\nI rather think there\u2019s been enough erasure of the traditions of indigenous cultures, spiritual or otherwise.

I have always wanted a church wedding (or at least a venue with a chapel on site, to avoid the rigmarole of guests having to commute between venues for the reception). When we found our venue, they offered an option of either a ceremony under the oak trees in the lane, or in the chapel. My fianc\u00e9 liked the aesthetic of the lane ceremony (and, to be fair, it's a beautiful setting), but his immediate reaction was to defer to me because he knows how important the church wedding is to me.
