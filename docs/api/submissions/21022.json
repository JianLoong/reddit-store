In my culture (Maori) we wear a cloak called a korowai (or a kakahu) on special occasions. These cloaks are \\*steeped\\* in meaning, right down to the colour. A green korowai can represent life (or someone who saves lives. I have a green cloak because I work in a paramedicine service as a Chaplain). As a culture we are inherently spiritual.\r  \n\r  \nOur culture is very complicated to engage with. We are indigenous, and so my non-Maori friends find it to be a bit of a minefield. I do my best to support them because they have genuine hearts for our people. I don't ever get offended when my friends are trying to navigate this journey, I understand the complexities of it. \r  \n\r\r  \n\rWhen I told my groomsmen I'd be providing and blessing (a compulsory aspect of our culture when it comes to what we call \"taonga\" or treasures is they must be blessed) them with korowai to wear on the day they were all over the moon. You have to be gifted a korowai, and they wouldn't have the opportunity. To me this was spiritually symbolic of their journey with me, and having my friends in our korowai on my wedding day is deeply important to me.\r  \n\r  \nMy partner is very passionate about my culture, but she is not Maori. When I told her I was letting them choose their own korowai that we'd pay for, she was initially fine with it. When we discussed it with one of the groomsmen she got upset when I said \"And they're choosing their own korowai, including colour, and matching their outfit with the korowai by wearing shades underneath\". She said it would look \"shoddy and mis-matched in photos\". She said that the korowai all had to be the same colour, and that the suits had to be matching. I reinforced to her the importance of the colours of a korowai (for example if you \\*are\\* Maori you typically wear the colours of your tribe or that represent who you are) but she said I must choose a matching korowai for all of them, and they have to wear black suits underneath. Her concern was looking \"rag tag\" for the photos.\r  \n\r  \nWhen my Maori best man heard this (he was not at the initial heated conversation) he very politely voiced his discomfort to me, and said he'd rather not wear our traditional cloaks if it was dictated to him what he was wearing (because it betrays his own relationship with our culture, and the people of our culture). This put me at an impasse. Not because I see it as her vs him (they get along really well) but because I respect his outlook on our culture, and the significance of this kind of thing in it.\r  \n\r  \nWe're now at a stand off.

Representing your culture means doing it correctly for you and your groomsmen regardless of if it \u201clooks shoddy\u201d (which in my opinion I don\u2019t think it will). When you look back at these photos it won\u2019t be to see what is coordinating, it won\u2019t be about what people wore at all but it will be to see the people that you love and reminiscing the day and the celebration of your life. You don\u2019t get married so that you can have pictures, you do it to join two people who love each other and want their lives tied together.

If she truly understands and appreciates your culture like you says she does, as an outsider, then this should be a non issue.

I would seriously consider sitting down with her, and telling her how her \u201cpreferences\u201d and refusal to budge on her opinions for a purely visual reason makes you, and your other groomsman, feel.

Your explanation for the cultural significance and why they need to choose ones that represent them and the fact that they will not all match is part of what makes this so meaningful is very clear here.

Maybe you could talk with the photographer to reassure her that this can still look amazing in the photos.", "NTA like I can't go my missus and say hey this year for lunar new year can you make everyone wear green instead of red. I can say to her hey I want to throw a party on some random day and l want to set a green theme but I can't cherry pick bits of her tradition and ignore other aspects.\n\nLike if she's Christian, you can't just say hey can you get the priest to wear a suit like the groomsmen, so it looks nice and matching for the photos. If you want a wedding in a church, you're getting married by a priest. You can't just hire the church and do your own thing. \n\nThis should be the same for you, if you're bringing your culture in then she needs to respect it.

She doesn't understand that your friends aren't going to 'cosplay', it's not about how it's going to look on the photos, and groomsmen aren't mere 'extras' in a wedding. They are there because they are important to you and you want them to hold a special place in your life. And by the way I think that you wanting to 'bless' them and honoring them with traditional garbs that hold such a deep meaning for you, is so much more meaningful than what we habitually see during weddings.\n\nI mean, I live in Japan... Here they hire 'white' actors to play priests during 'christian' wedding ceremonies...  \n\n\nWe're soooo far away from people who would 'gatekeep' their religion and culture. It's so much more than sharing. I envy the people who have unique chance to count between your friends.

I am seriously side eying your fiance for being disrespectful towards your culture and cultural garments because she wants a certain aesthetic.", "NTA\n\nIt's quite apparent to people not inside your circle just how important your culture and the meaning behind the cloaks is to you, and if the main person INSIDE can't see this and respect it because to her they will look \"shoddy and mismatched in photos\" then you have to ask yourself if someone who is willing to dismiss your beliefs so easily is someone you can spend the rest of your life with.\n\nIf it was me and I had something that I felt this strongly about then this is ABSOLUTELY the hill I'd be willing to die on.", "Definitely NTA, as a kiwi this sounds bloody cool.
