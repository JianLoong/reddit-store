In my culture (Maori) we wear a cloak called a korowai (or a kakahu) on special occasions. These cloaks are \\*steeped\\* in meaning, right down to the colour. A green korowai can represent life (or someone who saves lives. I have a green cloak because I work in a paramedicine service as a Chaplain). As a culture we are inherently spiritual.\r  \n\r  \nOur culture is very complicated to engage with. We are indigenous, and so my non-Maori friends find it to be a bit of a minefield. I do my best to support them because they have genuine hearts for our people. I don't ever get offended when my friends are trying to navigate this journey, I understand the complexities of it. \r  \n\r\r  \n\rWhen I told my groomsmen I'd be providing and blessing (a compulsory aspect of our culture when it comes to what we call \"taonga\" or treasures is they must be blessed) them with korowai to wear on the day they were all over the moon. You have to be gifted a korowai, and they wouldn't have the opportunity. To me this was spiritually symbolic of their journey with me, and having my friends in our korowai on my wedding day is deeply important to me.\r  \n\r  \nMy partner is very passionate about my culture, but she is not Maori. When I told her I was letting them choose their own korowai that we'd pay for, she was initially fine with it. When we discussed it with one of the groomsmen she got upset when I said \"And they're choosing their own korowai, including colour, and matching their outfit with the korowai by wearing shades underneath\". She said it would look \"shoddy and mis-matched in photos\". She said that the korowai all had to be the same colour, and that the suits had to be matching. I reinforced to her the importance of the colours of a korowai (for example if you \\*are\\* Maori you typically wear the colours of your tribe or that represent who you are) but she said I must choose a matching korowai for all of them, and they have to wear black suits underneath. Her concern was looking \"rag tag\" for the photos.\r  \n\r  \nWhen my Maori best man heard this (he was not at the initial heated conversation) he very politely voiced his discomfort to me, and said he'd rather not wear our traditional cloaks if it was dictated to him what he was wearing (because it betrays his own relationship with our culture, and the people of our culture). This put me at an impasse. Not because I see it as her vs him (they get along really well) but because I respect his outlook on our culture, and the significance of this kind of thing in it.\r  \n\r  \nWe're now at a stand off. She has said its absolutely not happening, I have said it absolutely is happening. I want to know if I'm being the AH for standing my ground on this, or whether I should just back down.", "created_utc": 1688176956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nir82/aita_for_wanting_my_groomsmen_to_wear_my/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you look back at these photos it won\u2019t be to see what is coordinating, it won\u2019t be about what people wore at all but it will be to see the people that you love and reminiscing the day and the celebration of your life. You don\u2019t get married so that you can have pictures, you do it to join two people who love each other and want their lives tied together.

I would seriously consider sitting down with her, and telling her how her \u201cpreferences\u201d and refusal to budge on her opinions for a purely visual reason makes you, and your other groomsman, feel.

I can say to her hey I want to throw a party on some random day and l want to set a green theme but I can't cherry pick bits of her tradition and ignore other aspects.\n\nLike if she's Christian, you can't just say hey can you get the priest to wear a suit like the groomsmen, so it looks nice and matching for the photos. If you want a wedding in a church, you're getting married by a priest. You can't just hire the church and do your own thing. \n\nThis should be the same for you, if you're bringing your culture in then she needs to respect it.

She doesn't understand that your friends aren't going to 'cosplay', it's not about how it's going to look on the photos, and groomsmen aren't mere 'extras' in a wedding.

And by the way I think that you wanting to 'bless' them and honoring them with traditional garbs that hold such a deep meaning for you, is so much more meaningful than what we habitually see during weddings.\n\nI mean, I live in Japan... Here they hire 'white' actors to play priests during 'christian' wedding ceremonies...  \n\n\nWe're soooo far away from people who would 'gatekeep' their religion and culture. It's so much more than sharing. I envy the people who have unique chance to count between your friends.

I am seriously side eying your fiance for being disrespectful towards your culture and cultural garments because she wants a certain aesthetic.", "NTA\n\nIt's quite apparent to people not inside your circle just how important your culture and the meaning behind the cloaks is to you, and if the main person INSIDE can't see this and respect it because to her they will look \"shoddy and mismatched in photos\" then you have to ask yourself if someone who is willing to dismiss your beliefs so easily is someone you can spend the rest of your life with.\n\nIf it was me and I had something that I felt this strongly about then this is ABSOLUTELY the hill I'd be willing to die on.", "Definitely NTA, as a kiwi this sounds bloody cool.

I didn't expect that, the internet can be dark and terrifying. It's really tough sometimes, a couple of weeks ago I was in a really bad headspace because I was \"sick of being Maori\" as every day is a fight. Every day you wake up and your language and culture are being argued about, ranging from people calling it all kinds of nasty things, to people dismissing it as irrelevant. People telling us our tattoos are ugly, our customs are barbaric, and our attitude is bad for our country. At the moment NZA (New Zealand Aotearoa) is changing road signs to have Maori names in places, and its the hot topic argument online. People saying our language is pointless to learn because our country is predominantly English speaking, and that Maori is being forced on people. When I point out English was forced on us we got told we're living in the past and need to get over it and move on. Last year the Maori new year, Matariki, finally got made a public holiday (the first Maori public holiday). That was the hot topic then. There's always something.\n\nI am genuinely inspired by the good people and the responses here. I didn't expect it, but this has truly filled my cup.

I understand she is in the \u2018bride zone\u2019 where everything has to be perfect but this feels like she is not respecting who you are as a person.  That worries me.  She\u2019s more focussed on the wedding than she is on the marriage, or the beliefs, identity and feelings of the person she is marrying, effectively rendering you an accessory to be dressed up.  What happens in the future?  If you have children in what belief system will they be raised?  Will she ride roughshod over your important traditions in how she wants to parent them?  Just as your cape is symbolic of something far deeper and integral to who you are, this difference of opinion is also symbolic and representative of a deeper, fundamental disconnect in your belief systems and respect for each other.

We just make sure that non-Maori have permission to do it from elders, and are trained or guided by members of a tribe of which they are representing.

Guided by their Tohunga (scholar/priest) the warriors searched for Te Rauparaha and as they drew near he muttered \u201cKa Mate Ka Mate\u201d (It is death, it is death). Concealed from the Tohunga by the spiritual powers of both food and the woman above, Te Rauparaha was not discovered, and as the searchers passed overhead he muttered \u201cKa ora Ka ora\u201d (It is life, it is life).
