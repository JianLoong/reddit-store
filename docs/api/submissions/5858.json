I do really well at my job and make significantly more than him. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem. I hate cleaning. Hate it. My perspective is I work really hard in other areas of my life in order to relax and not do stuff I don\u2019t want to do, such as cleaning. So, I have a cleaning service that comes monthly to do the deep clean, grout, bathrooms, baseboards, fans, blinds etc. \n\nMy boyfriend (an introvert) HATES this and has communicated it makes him very uncomfortable having someone he doesn\u2019t know in the house cleaning. I don\u2019t want to do the deep cleaning, and he doesn\u2019t do it either, so it just builds up.\n\nI already cut back from biweekly to monthly.

He can arrange to be out of the house when it\u2019s happening.", "NTA\n\nThe \"compromise\" is that if your boyfriend doesn't want the cleaners in the house, he needs to do the work himself, to your satisfaction. Since he refuses to do this, then the cleaners come. Too bad, so sad. \n\nThe only other (potential) compromise is to schedule the cleaners for a day and time that he can leave the house while they're there (if this isn't already the case).\n\nBut if his only allowable \"compromise\" is that *you* do all of the cleaning because *he* won't do it himself, nor will he allow anyone else come in to do it, then that shows how much regard he has for you and your well-being. DTMA.", "NTA. \n\nIf your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want a cleaning person in your house, he should do it.   Literally, this is the only compromise you should offer.", "NTA. The compromise is, if you don't have your cleaning service come, he needs to be doing the cleaning. If he doesn't do the cleaning, he can't complain about the service you pay for, and he can plan to be out when the cleaners come.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Tell your boyfriend, if he doesn't want you to hire a cleaner, and neither can he or yourself clean, then can he live with the state of the house? What is his proposed solution?", "NTA. You own the house and pay for the cleaning service. It also sounds like you had this cleaning service prior to him moving in. So it's your right to continue this service in your own home. Plus, you have already cut down the service to biweekly in an attempt to please him. I think that is a fair compromise. The only other compromise I can think of is if he starts doing what the cleaning service does, but I doubt he would do that. If he feels uncomfortable with them there, I'm sure he has plenty of time to plan to be gone during the time they are there since it is a scheduled thing.", "Obviously NTA - ask bf who he thinks will do the cleaning then? If he says you then you should go back to bi monthly cleaner. I\u2019m guessing you already do most of the everyday cleaning and what\u2019s the point of earning good money if you can\u2019t use it to make life easier? Tell him he will have to step up or deal with it.", "NTA. He can clean or you can have cleaners.", "NTA, too bad buddy. Unless he wants to take the time to do deep cleaning keep your cleaners and go back to biweekly as well. I\u2019m the same as you, I\u2019d rather spend the money to enjoy my free time instead of spending it on cleaning.", "NTA.  He's not offering a compromise and you can't just have a house that never gets cleaned.", "NTA. If he doesn\u2019t like how you maintain *your* house, he could move back out. The only compromise I can think of is that he gets out of the house when they come clean. \n\nBut beyond that, I just think it\u2019s ridiculous to complain about something but offer no solution or compromise. It reveals something pretty unflattering about the person ngl.", "NTA - it\u2019s your house and your money. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t wanna help with the clean up but he doesn\u2019t want you to hire someone - so he just expects you to do it?", "Don't compromise. If he doesn't want the cleaning service, he needs to do it himself. Since he doesn't, he also doesn't get to dictate how it gets done.", "NTA. If he's unwilling to do the deep cleaning himself then he has no argument about having a service come in. Personally I'd go back to biweekly and live in a healthier house.", "NTA if it bothers him he can:\n\nA) clean it himself \nB) find his own place\nC) grow the f*** up", "NTA, offer to pay him to do the same job, if he refuses or doesn't do it as well then go back to using the service same as before, he can leave if that doesn't work for him", ">Where do I find the compromise?\n\nHun, you already compromised by cutting the cleaning hours (and, personal opinion, a cleaning service once a month with shedding dogs in the house isn't enough).\n\nNow it's your bf turn to step up and taking the cleaning in his hands, if he doesn't like your solution. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your house and I assume you are paying for the service so even less of a reason for him to complain. \n\nIf he doesn't want to be there while they are cleaning then just leave for that time period or be in a different room while they clean.\n\nAsk him then who will do the cleaning?", "NTA. If he wants the cleaning person to stop visiting he needs to do the same work himself. You have already compromised. He on the other hand has not", "NTA. If you've got the means, outsource the crap you hate. \n\nThis is a big source of contention for me & my husband, too. I hate cleaning, but I'm the only one who does it. I also hate grocery shopping, so I prefer to use a delivery app. To him, doing either is \"cheating.\" For me, doing both is called, \"using my time wisely by not doing things I can afford to delegate.\" So far I've gotten him on board with the groceries. Cleaning service is for 2023. Stay strong!", "NTA. Your boy can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA- you have already compromised by cutting back from biweekly to monthly. And he\u2019s not willing to do the cleaning either so he needs to accept this compromise or yall should live separately", "NTA-  he cleans or shut up about it", "The compromise is he either sucks it up, he can do the cleaning, or he can move out! It\u2019s your home and you choose how you want to maintain or clean it!! It\u2019s that simple! He can always leave the house the day/time that the house cleaner is there! But he\u2019s being pretty ridiculous for a house that he doesn\u2019t own and doesn\u2019t want to pick up the work he\u2019s bitching about! You\u2019re also paying for it. Is he contributing to the household expenses at all? Rent, utilities etc? Absolutely NTA", "NTA, go back to biweekly and tell him to suck it up or do the work himself.", "NAH but he needs to either do all the cleaning himself or just plan to spend time out of the house biweekly, he has no business making you do that work for the sake of his social anxiety (source: 30 years coping with moderate social anxiety)", "NTA.

He just wants you to be his maid.  Tell him you are going back to normal unless he starts cleaning more.", "NTA - I think you really need to reevaluate this relationship. What is your BF expecting regarding cleaning the house? Personally I think bi-weekly is already a HUGH compromise if you have super sheddy dogs.

That's a compromise.   Bitching that he doesn't like the service so you need to do the cleaning is misogyny.", "INFO: was he not aware you used a cleaning service before he moved in?", "NTA does he plan on taking up the task of cleaning?  No... cleaners continue to come", "Nta - you did find the compromise by cutting back.  He can be there, he can get to know to them, he can put security cameras in the house (as long as they know), he can do the actual work. Those are his choices. Otherwise, he has to suck it up.", "NTA. \n\nIF, And I do mean IF, you want to compromise, you could try having a space that the cleaners don't enter (my brain says bedroom, but if he uses one of the other rooms as a hobby or gaming area or something, maybe that one). The tradeoff for that would be that he is responsible for it, and if he let's it get too grimy it will need to go back to being professionally cleaned.\n\nOverall tho... I get it on both sides here. I hate cleaning. If I could afford it, I would 100% have someone else do it. I also hate people in my space. I think the only person who doesn't live in my home that has been in my bedroom is my mother.", "NTA you found the comprosmise. it was monthly", "NTA\n\n\nThe compromise is, if he doesn't want a cleaner coming in, HE IS THE CLEANER. \n\n\nIf he won't clean, he can sit down and shut up.", "NTA\n\nyour bf is being ridiculous", "Came here to say this.

But anything with cleaning automation or outsourcing the work and he gets weird about it.", "It's a weird stance, but not so uncommon.\n\nI had a Uni friend with the same old schools views. He barely tolerated the washing machine, but when it came to the vacuum cleaner or the dishwasher he was absolutely adverse. Well, as long as it's his house, his problem. But he tried to get me to give away my dishwasher and sweep the floors with a broom.\n\nMy family, on the other hand, has always been super-technological and innovative, I've had a dishwasher in the house since 1982, so my answer was a gargantuan laugh.\n\nLike, dude, I'm not wasting 3 hours of my time if there's an appliance that allows me to get the work done in half an hours.", "NTA\n\nThis is your house that HE moved into.\n\nYou have deep-cleaning twice a month, that's just the way it is. To me, the compromise is to have them come when he's not there, or to tell him the exact days/times and he can make himself scarce.\n\nI had something similar with my now-husband. I looked at it as outsourcing tasks I hated and that I made enough to do so; he looked at it as \"a waste\" that he could do himself.\n\nHe said he would do it. Of course it wasn't nearly the same as a dedicated cleaner. It was my apartment, I told him I just liked the convenience, I made enough to have it cleaned, he could either deal with it or not, but that was what was going to happen.\n\nHe saw how much calmer I was with the clean apartment, how it removed stress from our relationship.... he understood the value of it.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA Heck, I'm an introvert and I would still love to have a good dependable cleaning service!", "NTA. I used to clean houses as a side gig and not one but two of my client's husbands would need to know what hours I would be there was to specifically make sure they weren't there because they didn't like being around strangers. I absolutely get not wanting to be around strangers especially when they're cleaning your place but the compromise isn't for you to stop using them.", "NTA. \n\nYour house, your money, your time = your choice.\n\nIf it really makes him uncomfortable, he can clean it himself. But since you said he is unwilling to do that, he really just needs to suck it up. Can't have your cake and eat it too.", "NTA", "NTA. I hope you can work it out. Been with my husband for 30+ years and he has always refused to get a cleaning service. Even after I got a job that had me working crazy hours. And it was not the money, it was because his family never had one so there's no need. Must do everything \"the (his surname) way \"\n\nIt was all I could do to get him to agree to a dishwasher when we redid the kitchen. His father REFUSED to allow his stepmom to have a clothes dryer for the longest time but she finally broke him on that. \n\nI think it was largely because my late MIL just LOVED all things housekeeping. It was her favorite pastime, her recreation, her labor of love. Their house was always spotless.", "Well, what does he want? For you to do all the work since he refuses to do it? I'm an introvert too; I have extreme anxiety about anyone coming into my apartment but if I had the money I'd definitely hire a cleaning service because a dirty apartment gives me even more anxiety. NTA", "NTA. I get that he's uncomfortable, but he's basically saying that you need to do all the extra work or just let it slide to make him comfortable. \n\nIf he's really that uncomfortable, he could just suck it up and do the deep cleaning himself.\n\nYou already found the compromise. Once a month instead of bi-weekly. Now he needs to meet you there.", "NTA There is no compromise, your house and you are paying for the upkeep and maintenance and care of said house. Compromise would be him taking over the deep cleaning, not you having less and less cleaning done.", "Tell him to get used to cleaning or the cleaning company because you don\u2019t want to live in a sty.", "NTA. He can leave the house while the cleaner is there if he's so bothered.", "NTA. As long as you are paying a fair wage and can financially afford the service there is nothing wrong with having a service to cover the deep cleaning (hell, there's nothing wrong with having a cleaner for more mundane cleaning either!)\n\nYou have already compromised on your end. A compromise is when both parties give something not when one person gets what they want and the other pouts. Your boyfriend needs to accept that he has to compromise as well. You have reduced the frequency, now your boyfriend needs to compromise and either be out of the house when they are there or work on his anxiety having a PROFESSIONAL in the house.", "I think I\u2019m good on the wage. $200 for the deep deep clean, $130 for maintenance cleaning. 3-4 hour window for the work.", "Yep. That was the compromise here aswell.   \nThe cleaner came when my husband was at home and I was not. I hate someone else in my house, but I was too sick to do it myself back then.", "Let him know: if using a cleaning service is \u201ccheating\u201d, then so is refusing to clean while thinking that.", "I'd say NTA if he knew. He could/should have asked about it if it bothered him. It can't be bothering him that much of he isn't willing to put in a few hours a week taking care of the things that will get disgusting without the cleaners."]}
