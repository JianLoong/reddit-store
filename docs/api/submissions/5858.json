You don't have to compromise. You don't want to clean. Presumably your boyfriend doesn't want to step in and do all of it. Done. Cleaners are coming.", "NTA. And I wouldn\u2019t cut back. He can arrange to be out of the house when it\u2019s happening.", "NTA\n\nThe \"compromise\" is that if your boyfriend doesn't want the cleaners in the house, he needs to do the work himself, to your satisfaction. Since he refuses to do this, then the cleaners come. Too bad, so sad. \n\nThe only other (potential) compromise is to schedule the cleaners for a day and time that he can leave the house while they're there (if this isn't already the case).\n\nBut if his only allowable \"compromise\" is that *you* do all of the cleaning because *he* won't do it himself, nor will he allow anyone else come in to do it, then that shows how much regard he has for you and your well-being. DTMA.", "NTA. \n\nIf your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want a cleaning person in your house, he should do it.   Literally, this is the only compromise you should offer.", "NTA. The compromise is, if you don't have your cleaning service come, he needs to be doing the cleaning. If he doesn't do the cleaning, he can't complain about the service you pay for, and he can plan to be out when the cleaners come.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Tell your boyfriend, if he doesn't want you to hire a cleaner, and neither can he or yourself clean, then can he live with the state of the house? What is his proposed solution?", "NTA. You own the house and pay for the cleaning service. It also sounds like you had this cleaning service prior to him moving in. So it's your right to continue this service in your own home. Plus, you have already cut down the service to biweekly in an attempt to please him. I think that is a fair compromise. The only other compromise I can think of is if he starts doing what the cleaning service does, but I doubt he would do that. If he feels uncomfortable with them there, I'm sure he has plenty of time to plan to be gone during the time they are there since it is a scheduled thing.", "Obviously NTA - ask bf who he thinks will do the cleaning then? If he says you then you should go back to bi monthly cleaner. I\u2019m guessing you already do most of the everyday cleaning and what\u2019s the point of earning good money if you can\u2019t use it to make life easier? Tell him he will have to step up or deal with it.", "NTA. He can clean or you can have cleaners.", "NTA, too bad buddy. Unless he wants to take the time to do deep cleaning keep your cleaners and go back to biweekly as well. I\u2019m the same as you, I\u2019d rather spend the money to enjoy my free time instead of spending it on cleaning.", "NTA.  He's not offering a compromise and you can't just have a house that never gets cleaned.", "NTA. If he doesn\u2019t like how you maintain *your* house, he could move back out. The only compromise I can think of is that he gets out of the house when they come clean. \n\nBut beyond that, I just think it\u2019s ridiculous to complain about something but offer no solution or compromise. It reveals something pretty unflattering about the person ngl.", "NTA - it\u2019s your house and your money. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t wanna help with the clean up but he doesn\u2019t want you to hire someone - so he just expects you to do it?", "Don't compromise. If he doesn't want the cleaning service, he needs to do it himself. Since he doesn't, he also doesn't get to dictate how it gets done.", "NTA. If he's unwilling to do the deep cleaning himself then he has no argument about having a service come in. Personally I'd go back to biweekly and live in a healthier house.", "NTA if it bothers him he can:\n\nA) clean it himself \nB) find his own place\nC) grow the f*** up", "NTA, offer to pay him to do the same job, if he refuses or doesn't do it as well then go back to using the service same as before, he can leave if that doesn't work for him", ">Where do I find the compromise?\n\nHun, you already compromised by cutting the cleaning hours (and, personal opinion, a cleaning service once a month with shedding dogs in the house isn't enough).\n\nNow it's your bf turn to step up and taking the cleaning in his hands, if he doesn't like your solution. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your house and I assume you are paying for the service so even less of a reason for him to complain. \n\nIf he doesn't want to be there while they are cleaning then just leave for that time period or be in a different room while they clean.\n\nAsk him then who will do the cleaning?", "NTA. If he wants the cleaning person to stop visiting he needs to do the same work himself. You have already compromised. He on the other hand has not", "NTA. If you've got the means, outsource the crap you hate. \n\nThis is a big source of contention for me & my husband, too. I hate cleaning, but I'm the only one who does it. I also hate grocery shopping, so I prefer to use a delivery app. To him, doing either is \"cheating.\" For me, doing both is called, \"using my time wisely by not doing things I can afford to delegate.\" So far I've gotten him on board with the groceries. Cleaning service is for 2023. Stay strong!", "NTA. Your boy can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA- you have already compromised by cutting back from biweekly to monthly. And he\u2019s not willing to do the cleaning either so he needs to accept this compromise or yall should live separately", "NTA-  he cleans or shut up about it", "The compromise is he either sucks it up, he can do the cleaning, or he can move out! It\u2019s your home and you choose how you want to maintain or clean it!! It\u2019s that simple! He can always leave the house the day/time that the house cleaner is there! But he\u2019s being pretty ridiculous for a house that he doesn\u2019t own and doesn\u2019t want to pick up the work he\u2019s bitching about! You\u2019re also paying for it. Is he contributing to the household expenses at all? Rent, utilities etc? Absolutely NTA", "NTA, go back to biweekly and tell him to suck it up or do the work himself.", "NAH but he needs to either do all the cleaning himself or just plan to spend time out of the house biweekly, he has no business making you do that work for the sake of his social anxiety (source: 30 years coping with moderate social anxiety)", "NTA. Tell him to go out when the cleaner shows up. Is he waiting for elves to do it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When I work from home that day I just put a note on my office door not to disturb (and ofc cleans my office myself later on that day).\n\nSo he could put a dnd sign on a door and fox that room himself?", "Nta,\nHe doesn't want people there but doesn't want to clean. He just wants you to be his maid.  Tell him you are going back to normal unless he starts cleaning more.", "NTA - I think you really need to reevaluate this relationship. What is your BF expecting regarding cleaning the house? Personally I think bi-weekly is already a HUGH compromise if you have super sheddy dogs. You hate cleaning and you can afford professional cleaners - he\u2019s made it clear by his actions that he\u2019s not going to clean", "NTA  if he doesn't want the service coming in, he does the cleaning.   That's a compromise.   Bitching that he doesn't like the service so you need to do the cleaning is misogyny.", "INFO: was he not aware you used a cleaning service before he moved in?", "NTA does he plan on taking up the task of cleaning?  No... cleaners continue to come", "Nta - you did find the compromise by cutting back.  He can be there, he can get to know to them, he can put security cameras in the house (as long as they know), he can do the actual work. Those are his choices. Otherwise, he has to suck it up.", "NTA. \n\nIF, And I do mean IF, you want to compromise, you could try having a space that the cleaners don't enter (my brain says bedroom, but if he uses one of the other rooms as a hobby or gaming area or something, maybe that one). The tradeoff for that would be that he is responsible for it, and if he let's it get too grimy it will need to go back to being professionally cleaned.\n\nOverall tho... I get it on both sides here. I hate cleaning. If I could afford it, I would 100% have someone else do it. I also hate people in my space. I think the only person who doesn't live in my home that has been in my bedroom is my mother.", "NTA you found the comprosmise. it was monthly", "NTA\n\n\nThe compromise is, if he doesn't want a cleaner coming in, HE IS THE CLEANER. \n\n\nIf he won't clean, he can sit down and shut up.", "NTA\n\nyour bf is being ridiculous", "Came here to say this.

It needs to be done. \n\nWhy can\u2019t he just leave when they come if he\u2019s so uncomfortable?", "To be fair, he\u2019s really good about the every day cleaning.  I actually have given up on the dishes because he hates using the dishwasher, and I refuse to wash by hand. So I told him he can either let me get them done the way I do, or he can do them.

The compromise is being out of the house while the cleaning person is in the house.", "How can someone be against a dishwasher?

He was raised super old school with \u201cyou\u2019re responsible for the state of your home\u201d. He\u2019s great about daily cleaning stuff (does more than me!).  But anything with cleaning automation or outsourcing the work and he gets weird about it.", "It's a weird stance, but not so uncommon.\n\nI had a Uni friend with the same old schools views. He barely tolerated the washing machine, but when it came to the vacuum cleaner or the dishwasher he was absolutely adverse. Well, as long as it's his house, his problem. But he tried to get me to give away my dishwasher and sweep the floors with a broom.\n\nMy family, on the other hand, has always been super-technological and innovative, I've had a dishwasher in the house since 1982, so my answer was a gargantuan laugh.\n\nLike, dude, I'm not wasting 3 hours of my time if there's an appliance that allows me to get the work done in half an hours."]}
