You own the house and pay for the cleaning service. It also sounds like you had this cleaning service prior to him moving in. So it's your right to continue this service in your own home. Plus, you have already cut down the service to biweekly in an attempt to please him. I think that is a fair compromise. The only other compromise I can think of is if he starts doing what the cleaning service does, but I doubt he would do that.

Plus, all these tasks and grocery items are literally written on our wipeboard on the fridge. Pick a task, do it, mark it out just once and I will suspend my Instacart subscription and forget about the cleaning service.\" Then he just sighs, says, \"Dammit, I guess you're right.\" I tell him to speak louder and into the microphone so I can record someone in the house saying I'm right, then we move on.

I agree OP should keep her cleaners, but I have had bad luck when my husband and I tried, with maid services being very chatty people like hair stylists and even trying to interact with us (we WFH) a bunch, whether working or off work doing something. I wonder if other companies are better, but we tried a few and all were exhausting, loud, trying to small talk, etc. I do the deep cleaning myself to avoid it, personally, and I\u2019m not shy or anxious, just hate small talk and people randomly singing worse than cleaning (plus we ran into people not prioritizing the cleaning as we\u2019d asked or touching stuff we asked them not to touch that they didn\u2019t need to\u2014like clean my toilets and floors not my fridge magnets while asking where each one is from, please. But it seemed classist and mean to insist on antisocial cleaning, I guess. I have finally found a hair dresser who is basically silent but it took SO long\u2014I didn\u2019t have the energy to try more than 3 cleaning companies.", "I've never had that experience so you may have just had bad luck. Did you explain that you were working and didn't have time to chat?", "I definitely pointed out we were both working, but it\u2019s not just \u201ctime\u201d so I didn\u2019t phrase it that way. My husband hates chatting too, but he also hates when I\u2019m to direct and tell people I have no interest in small talk with them so I think I mostly just avoided but it was uncomfortable for us both. And then they loudly talked to each other when not talking to me, or sang, etc. I would write it off as bad luck if it happened only once. To me, it wasn\u2019t about time though\u2014I just don\u2019t want to talk to strangers, I just want the service, but I know some folks find that unreasonable. I think that\u2019s the introvert thing though\u2014small talk to me is a MAJOR chore, maybe the biggest thing, certainly worse than scrubbing a floor, but all these folks in industries like cleaning either are extroverts who bring large energy in or faking it for tips. I wish I could call a service and request \u201cNo small talk, quiet as possible\u201d. \n\nOur house is pretty small and I had to stay in a spot with the dogs so I couldn\u2019t move as they moved. I wanted mostly upstairs cleaning each time, but they kept doing (a bunch of light) cleaning in the kitchen I\u2019d already deep cleaned myself. I was direct and even redirected but it\u2019s just exhausting, especially if I might offend someone with the truth. People often expect introverts to still make small talk and pretend to be interested, which I find fucked up, even more so in my own home, so I think it\u2019s a bit of an introvert thing (though I think worse for women with expectations, as men are often more \u201callowed\u201d to be quiet and aloof).\n\nI do not find public libraries very relaxing either though, as people will come up and talk to me sometimes there too (not always, but not uncommon). I find my home my only sanctuary where strangers don\u2019t feel a right to positive attention and chitchat, I guess. I\u2019m not shy at all, but people tend to get annoyed when you tell them you really don\u2019t want to talk to them, even nicely, and everyone assumes you should talk to people. It\u2019s an extrovert\u2019s world, because no one has made a simple way of declining social interactions that everyone approves of and accepts. So yes, I recharge alone and literally every unwanted social interaction hits my battery, including cleaning people asking questions about my stuff and my work and my life and telling me stories. Hopefully OP\u2019s cleaning folks aren\u2019t like this (and usually people are less so with men, I notice with my husband) and it\u2019s not the issue, but it can be an introvert thing and any public place is not an introvert paradise to me, I guess, because the default for extroverts there is never to just leave people alone.\n\n(If you interacted with me, I might ask politely to focus on something, but I\u2019d not say this stuff in person because when you do, people get upset and find you rude. So you wouldn\u2019t know and I am not shy/socially anxious, just frustrated and drained from this stuff, in basically every setting besides my own home, with no strangers around. Just life, never found a good way around it really.)", "It's wild how different people's life experiences are. I almost *never* have people approach me to talk to me in public, and I wouldn't mind it, since I'm a huge extrovert! I know some people have resting \"come tell me your life story\" face, the opposite of resting bitch face; you sound like you must have that. My wife does, too. Most people don't have strangers try to talk to them in libraries!\n\n>  I wish I could call a service and request \u201cNo small talk, quiet as possible\u201d.\n\nYou probably could, tbh. I don't know if it would work, but it's worth a shot.", "Not to assume, but if you\u2019re male, my experience is that men typically don\u2019t face this issue as much (women and men approaching them less). I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m finally not being hit on in public all the time, but people definitely seem to expect women to be more sociable with strangers. So maybe that\u2019s it, idk, but the cleaners DID bother my husband as well and try to chitchat with him in all cases, even one I wasn\u2019t home because I didn\u2019t wfh then! (But in public people come up to him alone way less or talk to me if we\u2019re both together.)\n\nMy husband would never let me request that and probably people in general would think I was rude. I \u201ccould\u201d but I\u2019d be an AH to many, even though I\u2019d pay more for it etc. Society has no sympathy for introverts, especially introverted women. Though, also if you\u2019re an extrovert, you can\u2019t really understand because you may not notice the small interactions that take change from folks like me.\n\nEdit: I also lived overseas in many places and besides being hit on (I was young then), I never had this issue outside America, with people wanting so much chitchat, either because they figured I didn\u2019t speak the language or their culture was simply different (varied by place). But I had the issue even masked during Covid at grocery stores etc. in America if I ever went out. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my \u201cface\u201d as much as my gender and maybe region/country. Or everyone does and extroverts just don\u2019t notice a bit of small talk and/or like it. I prefer literally no in person interaction unless we have something established in common or a purpose to speak. Literally every interaction with strangers really drains me, except in text. I love talking online in text form with anyone!", "NTA. I presume you utilized their services before he moved in. I would not reduce the frequency either.

When I moved into my current SO\u2019s house I gave him the option between:\n\n- we get a cleaner\n\n- he does all the cleaning\n\nI was exceedingly clear that \u201cI do my half of the cleaning\u201d was not an option in the mix. \n\nI\u2019ve had cleaners for at least the last 20 years of my adult life - including during periods between jobs when I was living on my (rapidly reducing) savings. \n\nTurns out that I have adhd - only got diagnosed last year (and suspected a couple of years before that) which explains why I\u2019ve always struggled with housework etc. All I knew was that I did struggle, and it was a better use of my limited Executive Function to earn the money to pay for a cleaner. \n\nMy SO loves to clean - it soothes him & he\u2019s really good at it. If it was up to him we wouldn\u2019t use a cleaner, but he\u2019s self-aware enough to know that if he took on all the cleaning he would resent it / me eventually. \n\nSo he tries very hard not to judge the cleaners for not doing it as well as he would. Which is very kind of him. \n\n(And right now we\u2019re between cleaners - we had to fire the last company for being too bad / damaging stuff too often - and there\u2019s a shortage in our village right now.

It's not rude to ask for people who you are paying to perform work in your house to perform that work in a way that's considerate of you.

And they\u2019d probably still try small talk at the start, as a greeting, in my experience or in small ways they don\u2019t notice are draining."]}
