Like girl help yourself whenever! That\u2019s why it\u2019s there \ud83e\udd20", "I did this! Portioned out cereal and put some milk in a push pop plastic poppa and it was a game changer", "We used a smaller more manageable container for milk that the kids can use", "It\u2019s pretty great that OP and the lead commenter both had these unique and somewhat similarly themed usernames.
