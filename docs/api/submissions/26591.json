If you want them to be self-sufficient and independent, rather than treating their spouses like maids, please start now by insisting that they handle more of their own lives. They can learn to wake up to an alarm clock, cook their own basic meals, do laundry, clean, etc. Don't let them see you as the knower and doer of everything, because then that's the role they will unconsciously transfer onto a future spouse.", "They won't starve. You are entitled to your rest, they shouldn't need to wake you up unless someone gets hurt.", "I appreciate that. You wouldn't believe the stares I get when I start at chores met with allowances. They basically are deceased by the screen time and how it's not guaranteed.", "Do you ever beat your children when they fuck up? No. There's your problem.", " My seven year old feeds herself and our cat?", "Me neither \ud83d\ude06", "I think it's worse realizing it was posted by u/pussyandbananabread", "Right?  Yet a phrase that needed to exist.", "OP says in a later comment that they aren't allowed to use the stove. So, as she's gatekeeping their abilities to fend for themselves, I would say that it falls squarely on OP's shoulders. She won't let them cook, but then gets upset because they wake her to cook for them. Classic catch-22.\n\nAt 11, the sky was the limit pretty much in my house. Both my brothers and I were savvy enough to make just about anything our little hearts desired.\n\nOP - YTA. They are acting this way because of limits you placed on them. Make it right.", "I was getting the bus to the shops for ingredients....", "Jesus, this sounds exhausting", "Haha, no, she just opens the bag and put the wet food on  a plate. But then she uses a -gasp- knife to make herself a sandwich.", "That is very true. I was just saying they might have a legitimate reason to want OP to make a breakfast they can't handle themselves. Obviously OP is also very much in the right to say no.", "You can make scrambled eggs in the microwave. Just Crack an Egg. I make my own because it's cheaper and more diverse. You could even help them prep it the night before.", "My kid once set the microwave on fire, so there\u2019s that\u2026", "That's why I am actually thankful that my school taught us how to cook and use the kitchen safely in general. That way even those who hadn't been taught by their parents learned to cook.", "1.) I was second guessing the moment I hit reply lmao thank you\n2.) I know it\u2019s not okay. I just wanted to make it clear my kids aren\u2019t menaces to society. Just to their parents. \ud83d\ude05 Their teachers, school staff, family members, any adult they encounter constantly rave about how sweet and respectful they are and I\u2019m always like yeaaahhhh they have a dark side at home. I guess they gotta have some kind of outlet for being so sweet all the time but this is out of control lol", "I do feel a little guilty because the first time I was woken up was right before 7 and I told him to make cereal bc I don\u2019t feel good and need some more sleep. The second time was at 9 and I was woken up to whining of \u201cI\u2019m hunnnnggrrrryyyy\u201d So I asked if they had eaten cereal while they waited for me to get up and they said no. -___- So they definitely were very hungry but it was honestly by their own choice lol", "It\u2019s amazing how the association with a simple name like u/buttplugjesus can warp such an innocent comment.", "There are still toasters, microwaves, air fryers and refrigerators in kitchens. If she doesn\u2019t want them using the stove, they can have toast, bagels, cereal, etc.", "It\u2019s great that you were able to freely use the stove at 11! So was I! But I definitely know some children who at 13 I would 100% NOT trust to use the stove unsupervised. We don\u2019t know if OPs children as individuals ought to be allowed to use the stove and as their parent, OP is the one who has to make that call. \n\nThe kids could easily make themselves some cereal, pop tarts, or toaster waffles or something to hold them over until OP makes breakfast. It feels like a stretch to say there are any AH here because it\u2019s pretty trivial.", "At the age of nine I learned how to make fried bread. I loved fried bread and made it all the time till I tipped a frying pan of hot fat on my hand. Eleven is a fair bit older than nine but I totally get not using the burners unsupervised (including parents still asleep). \n\nLoads of breakfast can be made without it. I live in the land of the morning fry-up (the U.K.) but I don\u2019t eat it every damn morning\u2026", "They can make cereal, toast, sandwiches....stop acting like there's a lock on the fridge. Nobody is \"gatekeeping\" the 11 year old children from preparing themselves a snack before OP wakes up.", "Gee, at age 11, I could cook three full meals a day and make cookies, candies, and pastries. I helped with canning too. \n\nOP, teach those kids to cook!", "She sounds like a wonderfully capable 7 year old, whose skills vastly exceed my attempts at humour.", "There's also Just Egg, which is a vegan egg alternative that goes in the microwave and is like a little almost-scrambled egg you can put in a breakfast sandwich or scramble up on a plate. I'm not vegan and I use them because they're quicker/more portable than real eggs.", "My stepfather once set my microwave on fire, so theres that.", "I'm old enough that in middle school the girls took \"home economy\" aka cooking and sewing; and the boys got wood, metal, and auto shop.\n\nWe were taught to bake cookies, clean a kitchen, and sew a skirt and blouse. Boys got to make cool things and learned to change the oil in a car.", "That's still not a good thing. Who is going to be their outlet once they leave home? Roommates? Partners?", "/r/rimjob_steve", "No, that's probably just me not understanding jokes, since that's not one of my strong points.", "This one made me giggle. Self deprecation is probably my favourite kind of humour.", "Well I am definitely not as old as you are then because we all had to do wood work and home economic no matter the gender but I bet it was the same in the past here in Germany as well. When I went to school one half of the class had a semester of home economy while the other did things like wood and metal. Then next semester we switched. Not every school type does this here but I definitely appreciated it.", "Again, I know and am going to put a stop to it. This just recently started happening.", "It changed a couple of years later. By the time I graduated HS women were finally allowed to have bank accounts without their father's/husband's approval! (mid-1970s).", "I would recommend giving them a choice. Either:\n\n- they wake up super early and get their own breakfast\n\n-they stay in bed or leave you alone until (specified time) and you will make them breakfast\n\n- they wake up early and wake you up and you will not make them breakfast. If they do it to you again you will confiscate the TV remote also.", "OP doesn't let them use the stove. At 11. Because obviously being a helicopter parent has draw backs, so then you can go on AITA and ask people if they are wee jerks and not write, but I create roadblocks to their self-sufficiency.\n\nOP - YTA. Teach them and let them have at it. and then tell them to stop bothering you."]}
