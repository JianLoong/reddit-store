I adopted my son out of foster care when he was 8 years old, he has been with me since he was 6. \n\nIn the years since the adoption, my son\u2019s mental health issues have extremely worsened. He is diagnosed with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and suspected fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. I feel like I have tried absolutely everything I can access - every kind of counseling, family therapy, getting him engaged with activities, enrolling him in a mentorship program, changing his school. I have begged post adoption services for scholarship funds for residential treatment but they have been \u201cworking on it\u201d for two years now. My son lies, physically aggressive with me and teachers, and is constantly getting suspended from school, sneaking out, skipping school, and getting involved with the wrong crowd. I also suspect he is using hard drugs. I love my son and I would do anything to help lessen the pain he feels inside, but I\u2019m at a loss. We\u2019ve had very sincere and heartfelt (on my end) conversations about how his behavior devastates me and how much I want for his future because he deserves the world after what he has been through. I say that to say, he knows how much this kind of behavior devastates me. \n\nMy son was recently arrested for very serious offenses. I saw him immediately after he was arrested. I asked him why he would do something like this to which he had no answer, and that was about the whole conversation other than me telling him I love him and hugging him.

It sounds terrible but I don\u2019t want to talk to him or see him.  \n\nI will show up at every court appearance and meeting about his future, but at this point, I don\u2019t want to talk to him 1:1. If I am being honest, I think a large part of it is I hope him sitting alone makes him change his ways because I don\u2019t know what else to try anymore. A social worker today told me that I *must* be there for my son throughout this process or I am risking being charged with abandonment because we don\u2019t know if he is even guilty. But I truly have not a single doubt in my mind he did what he is accused of. My intention isn\u2019t to abandon my son or go even months without contacting him, I just feel like I need a couple of weeks and I hope those couple of weeks would make him think about his actions too. \n\nPeople are full of comments like \u201ccharge the parents\u201d and that this could never be their kid, which I\u2019m sure is contributing to my anger, I can recognize that.

Behavior comes from the brain and his brain isn't working right. He is not wholly in control of himself, and there is no amount of reflecting or thinking about how horrible this is for you that will make him magically change. He might find his way to not repeat the specific thing that caused his detention but the drugs, the rule breaking, the aggressivity, are not going to go away because you don't visit him in prison. \n\nAside from specialized residential treatment there probably isn't anything that can help him. \n\nBe there for him in your own time, take care of yourself and try not to harbor too much resentment. Also listen to what social workers and lawyers tell you to protect yourself because when a kid that young breaks the law, blaming it on the parent is always an option.

Some kids are just too far gone and so out of touch that enough is never enough. Even if you did go to see him, you will obviously have nothing to say and I am sure he too will have nothing. I think this is a VERY good opportunity for him to reflect. These detention centers are like psych wards for kids, he will have access to counseling and therapy there and hopefully they can get through to him. Whatever this crime he did, or the severity of it, once he is out he is going to need support and unfortunately that will only come in the form of you cause I highly doubt his life is going to go the way he wants when that goes on his records.", "YTA, but it\u2019s so understandable.\n\nBut he cannot and will not learn from this.\n\nIf he has ODD only, he\u2019s incapable of not engaging in these behaviors.

He either won\u2019t care, or processes it as abuse.\n\nYou can pull back. It\u2019s okay to start putting up boundaries to emotionally and financially protect yourself. Your love can\u2019t heal him.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to see him more than you can manage. But you do need to stay in contact in some way\u2014even one way emails.

I hope you really figure this one out.\n\nI would definitely lean towards not temporarily ignoring your son but am aware you need to process. It might be helpful for you to reach out to some support of your own, maybe some form of counselling, just to help guide you through this process and be best prepared for what you choose to do. \n\nNAH.", "Your kid sounds like he has massive trauma which isn't surprising at all considering he's adopted. I honestly dread to think what happened before his adoption, and if I was you, seeing his behavior, I'd assume the worst. You've mentioned he has \"mental health issues\" but that sounds like a vague, imprecise blanket diagnosis. Again, I would assume the worst from very similar stories I've observed.\n\nWere you prepared and forewarned, or overall aware that children who come from the system already come from very troubled circumstances, among them being abandoned or separated in some way from their original family/parent, + being in the system for a few years? These are not easy issues to deal with for someone inexperienced, and you really need to be equipped and prepared for this. The second thing that bugs me is your speeches to him: you said you told him multiple times his behavior is devastating for you. But what about for him? Have you asked how he feels about his behavior? I don't want to assume, but did you overall show support and let him know that if he's struggling or needs help, he can turn to you?\n\nI think your son should absolutely avoid jail, and not be punished the way he could be, because he absolutely is a victim of circumstances here. Jail time would also just make him worse, overall. I don't think you should repress your own feelings, obviously if you are tired, then you are tired, which brings me back to my second point\u2014weren't you warned by foster care or anyone like this?\n\nI'd say that, YWBTA if you didn't hold on to this kid. He deserves it, and most importantly, he needs it. Those few weeks won't make him think about what happened in the way you imagine. \n\nHonestly, I'd love to hear more about the situation, can you explain how you feel a bit more and how your relationship with your son has been going?", "Your son is traumatized from his previous experiences and he most probably has a degree of sociopathy which means he simply lacks empathy and the ability to realize the consequences of his actions. His brain is probably less mature and physically affected by his upbringing. I'm not making excuses for him I'm just saying that you have a long road ahead of you but at some point he will be okay. Had a couple of foster kids in that situation, it was touch and go during the teenage years but they are both okay now, join a support group of other parents if you can and consult a lawyer about getting the services you need. \n\nYou can do this! Try to keep him away from hard drugs and an adult criminal record. I would go and see him because withdrawing from him now will make him withdraw from you. Your saying that you think he will learn a lesson is applying adult logic. He will see it as you letting him down. \n\nMany of the things that are painful for you are things he literally cannot control because he has not learned to yet.
