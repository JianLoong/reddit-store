I adopted my son out of foster care when he was 8 years old, he has been with me since he was 6. \n\nIn the years since the adoption, my son\u2019s mental health issues have extremely worsened. He is diagnosed with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and suspected fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. I feel like I have tried absolutely everything I can access - every kind of counseling, family therapy, getting him engaged with activities, enrolling him in a mentorship program, changing his school. I have begged post adoption services for scholarship funds for residential treatment but they have been \u201cworking on it\u201d for two years now. My son lies, physically aggressive with me and teachers, and is constantly getting suspended from school, sneaking out, skipping school, and getting involved with the wrong crowd. I also suspect he is using hard drugs. I love my son and I would do anything to help lessen the pain he feels inside, but I\u2019m at a loss. We\u2019ve had very sincere and heartfelt (on my end) conversations about how his behavior devastates me and how much I want for his future because he deserves the world after what he has been through. I say that to say, he knows how much this kind of behavior devastates me. \n\nMy son was recently arrested for very serious offenses. I saw him immediately after he was arrested. I asked him why he would do something like this to which he had no answer, and that was about the whole conversation other than me telling him I love him and hugging him.

It sounds terrible but I don\u2019t want to talk to him or see him.  \n\nI will show up at every court appearance and meeting about his future, but at this point, I don\u2019t want to talk to him 1:1. If I am being honest, I think a large part of it is I hope him sitting alone makes him change his ways because I don\u2019t know what else to try anymore. A social worker today told me that I *must* be there for my son throughout this process or I am risking being charged with abandonment because we don\u2019t know if he is even guilty. But I truly have not a single doubt in my mind he did what he is accused of. My intention isn\u2019t to abandon my son or go even months without contacting him, I just feel like I need a couple of weeks and I hope those couple of weeks would make him think about his actions too. \n\nPeople are full of comments like \u201ccharge the parents\u201d and that this could never be their kid, which I\u2019m sure is contributing to my anger, I can recognize that.

Behavior comes from the brain and his brain isn't working right. He is not wholly in control of himself, and there is no amount of reflecting or thinking about how horrible this is for you that will make him magically change. He might find his way to not repeat the specific thing that caused his detention but the drugs, the rule breaking, the aggressivity, are not going to go away because you don't visit him in prison. \n\nAside from specialized residential treatment there probably isn't anything that can help him. \n\nBe there for him in your own time, take care of yourself and try not to harbor too much resentment. Also listen to what social workers and lawyers tell you to protect yourself because when a kid that young breaks the law, blaming it on the parent is always an option.

Some kids are just too far gone and so out of touch that enough is never enough. Even if you did go to see him, you will obviously have nothing to say and I am sure he too will have nothing. I think this is a VERY good opportunity for him to reflect. These detention centers are like psych wards for kids, he will have access to counseling and therapy there and hopefully they can get through to him. Whatever this crime he did, or the severity of it, once he is out he is going to need support and unfortunately that will only come in the form of you cause I highly doubt his life is going to go the way he wants when that goes on his records.", "YTA, but it\u2019s so understandable.\n\nBut he cannot and will not learn from this.\n\nIf he has ODD only, he\u2019s incapable of not engaging in these behaviors.

I hope you really figure this one out.\n\nI would definitely lean towards not temporarily ignoring your son but am aware you need to process. It might be helpful for you to reach out to some support of your own, maybe some form of counselling, just to help guide you through this process and be best prepared for what you choose to do. \n\nNAH.", "Your kid sounds like he has massive trauma which isn't surprising at all considering he's adopted. I honestly dread to think what happened before his adoption, and if I was you, seeing his behavior, I'd assume the worst. You've mentioned he has \"mental health issues\" but that sounds like a vague, imprecise blanket diagnosis. Again, I would assume the worst from very similar stories I've observed.\n\nWere you prepared and forewarned, or overall aware that children who come from the system already come from very troubled circumstances, among them being abandoned or separated in some way from their original family/parent, + being in the system for a few years? These are not easy issues to deal with for someone inexperienced, and you really need to be equipped and prepared for this. The second thing that bugs me is your speeches to him: you said you told him multiple times his behavior is devastating for you. But what about for him? Have you asked how he feels about his behavior? I don't want to assume, but did you overall show support and let him know that if he's struggling or needs help, he can turn to you?\n\nI think your son should absolutely avoid jail, and not be punished the way he could be, because he absolutely is a victim of circumstances here. Jail time would also just make him worse, overall. I don't think you should repress your own feelings, obviously if you are tired, then you are tired, which brings me back to my second point\u2014weren't you warned by foster care or anyone like this?\n\nI'd say that, YWBTA if you didn't hold on to this kid. He deserves it, and most importantly, he needs it. Those few weeks won't make him think about what happened in the way you imagine. \n\nHonestly, I'd love to hear more about the situation, can you explain how you feel a bit more and how your relationship with your son has been going?", "Your son is traumatized from his previous experiences and he most probably has a degree of sociopathy which means he simply lacks empathy and the ability to realize the consequences of his actions. His brain is probably less mature and physically affected by his upbringing. I'm not making excuses for him I'm just saying that you have a long road ahead of you but at some point he will be okay. Had a couple of foster kids in that situation, it was touch and go during the teenage years but they are both okay now, join a support group of other parents if you can and consult a lawyer about getting the services you need. \n\nYou can do this! Try to keep him away from hard drugs and an adult criminal record. I would go and see him because withdrawing from him now will make him withdraw from you. Your saying that you think he will learn a lesson is applying adult logic. He will see it as you letting him down. \n\nMany of the things that are painful for you are things he literally cannot control because he has not learned to yet.

By likely, I mean, based on how he has handled situations previously, do you think he will suddenly wake up and decide that he has to change, or do you think he will decide that you've finally given up on him?\n\nI don't think you sound like TA, by the way. I think you sound (at least from what you've told us), like you have reached the end of your rope in a situation that you are powerless to effectively change, because it is out of your control. Even while you are in such distress, it sounds like your real hope is not to punish him or remove him from your life, but rather that you will finally get through to him in some way that helps him.\n\nI can't tell you what your child will do. Whether it will get through to him or make him worse. Ultimately, you don't really have the power to make his problems go away, and it's possible that he really doesn't either. Your situation is beyond endurance. While I hope you can still muster compassion for him, I do urge you to also grant yourself some compassion and forgiveness as well.\n\nAlso, I am curious as to how a social worker can claim you are abandoning your child when they are in state custody, which you presumably have no real power to change. I'm not saying that's not possible - I have seen more foolish and inconsiderate rules. But it seems sort of odd that you could be charged with abandonment of a child who is not in your custody and is in the remand of the state.", "I wonder if you have read The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. It can help you, and your son, understand how past trauma affects the body and mind in the present. He probably doesn't fully understand how his own brain and body are processing his past trauma. He truly can't answer why he acts out the way he does. This book can help. \n\nMaybe you can get a copy for both of you. Give him a highlighter and ask him to read it with you. Then see if he can highlight anything that feels like it applies to him and ask if he wants to discuss any of it with you or a therapist. \n\nEarly childhood trauma is so very hard to process and deal with. It's just so damaging, and it leads to unhealthy behaviors later that damage future relationships and can cause lifelong poor choices, and legal trouble goes hand in hand with that. \n\nI hope he'll still have a chance at his age to confront his past trauma and choose to work on rewiring how his brain and body react to things in the present and future. It helps to have someone who can still have the courage to believe in him, and to tell him they haven't given up on him. That they know he's smart and brave enough to confront his own impulses, figure out where they come from, and choose what kind of person he wants to be. He needs someone in his corner, now more than ever. \n\nMy heart goes out to you, because you sound completely burned out, exhausted, and just at the end of your rope right now. Caring so much about someone who just isn't capable of caring the same way himself is so hard. He may even seem like he doesn't even care about himself at all or care that you care. He may seem completely unmoved and completely selfish and devoid of empathy. It may feel like tossing love into an empty void. \n\nBut there is someone in there whose emotions are smothered by trauma. You may never be able to reach it, and he may never be able to uncover them, because they're buried too deep, and the risk of pain is too great to go there. Yet it's hard to give up all hope when there's a chance. He's still developing, still a work in progress. And right now, he's in a critical place where he's facing serious consequences. I don't know if this can give him motivation to try to use this time for introspection and to try to become more self aware. But it's worth a try. \n\nI don't have any judgment to offer. You can only give as much as you can give. It's understandable your feeling caregiver burnout. Give yourself compassion and as much as you can to recharge. It's hard. I'm really rooting for you. I'm rooting for him too.", "The lesson you are teaching him is that your love is conditional and you do not have his back. This might not be what you feel but it is all he\u2019ll be able to see. \n\nPlease go and visit him. \n\nBut also you need help. I\u2019m exhausted reading your story.

Unless we are in your position who are we to tell you off like you\u2019re some awful human being? \n\nTW: For some reason this came to mind. Just recently I watched a law and order svu episode, it was about a 14 year old who was raping a few kids a couple years younger then him. it went into detail that he didn\u2019t think or know what he was doing was wrong, and the stuff he was having access on the tv was to blame. Anyway, his bio father went ballistic and told the detective he from now on wanted nothing to do with his son. Each court case the kid is looking for his dad. In the end the father is explained by a detective that even though what his child did was wrong, he\u2019s still a child and he needs his father. His father showed up to court in the end. \n\nI feel like you just needed a safe space to rant, not that it was very safe and non judgmental here. But you will show up for your child. \nSometimes parents need a \u201cmoment\u201d and they are struggling too! That\u2019s ok, have your moment, rant a bit. Seek support, because you\u2019re allowed it as well, taking care of troubled children is hard. But in the end remember, he\u2019s a child and he still needs your support as hard as it is here and there to give it to him.", "> I must be there for my son throughout this process or I am risking being charged with abandonment. \n\n\nYou already got your answer.

But as someone who was in the foster care/ adopting life, I just want to say that sometimes people will push you. They may not feel heard or they may be going through something they dont feel comfortable telling you yet. That does not mean they don't love you. I still love my foster mom. I remember the smell of her sheets. I bit her when I first met her. We did also have a 'problem child' in our house. He did all of the things you talk about here. He could not be considered safe. He was abusive and hurtful. If you are up against a situation where you aren't safe, it is fine to figure how you may be safe. That's it.", "As a social worker, I'd say no. Of course you have to be there for the process of everything and you can't just leave your son to deal with everything on his own since he's quite young. But distancing yourself while he's in detention is not something that should be problematic. If anyone tries to turn that into you abandoning him, they're pretty much morons. You're not abandoning him, you're showing reasonable consiquences to his actions. If you go down a certain path, people will turn their backs on you eventually.

It sounds like your son has RAD. It's common in adopted children who previously experienced severe trauma. It's a trauma response so I can't help but feel some sympathy toward those with RAD, even though they can be very destructive and violent (yet at the same time can be charming and manipulative, especially when lying). \n\nRAD completely destroys parents and often puts family members at risk. It's not uncommon for children with RAD to hurt family pets and abuse both their siblings and their parents. \n\nUnfortunately, our society often blames the parents despite the parents trying their best and society offering jack shit in terms of help.\n\nI understand why you need respite from your son. I also understand that your son is deeply traumatized and damaged both biologically (you mentioned FAS) and emotionally by actions and circumstances that were not his fault.\n\nI urge you to find a group of parents struggling with the same problems.

What if you had a 12 year old who\u2019s legs were paralyzed who because of their disability was unable to save someone who was drowning right in front of them. And your reaction to that is to tell them you\u2019re so devastated that they wouldn\u2019t simply get up and save that person, how could they not just get up and save them? They couldn\u2019t. Physically incapable. This is your son\u2019s brain. Why couldn\u2019t he just stop and think? Because the part of his brain that would normally allow someone to stop and think is impaired. Just like a paralyzed person\u2019s spine is impaired. \n\nTrying to emotionally devastate him via abandonment so that he\u2019ll snap out of his impairments will always be doomed to failure because *knowing* you were wrong doesn\u2019t magically make your brain work right. Feeling like shit about himself, knowing the one person he thought might not abandon him, has, won\u2019t fix him. It won\u2019t fix the deficit in his brain. The things that *might* help are medication and therapy. Medication to help bring his brain chemistry closer to typical, and therapy to try and artificially construct the tools that most people have built in that will allow him to cope with his brain deficits.

We want to encourage moral guilt in children but not a parental guilt trip. In other words we want to encourage kids to feel guilt about the act- that he did something wrong. Not internalized guilt because he\u2019s a bad kid- his mom is disappointed. Internalizing that he is a bad person will lead to more bad behavior. Of course this is wayyyyyy over simplified.\n\nNot giving mom the benefit of the doubt, it\u2019s manipulative to the point of being incredibly self-centered. When you have kids they\u2019re going to make you feel all sorts of ways. It\u2019s not the kids job to support the parents emotionally.
