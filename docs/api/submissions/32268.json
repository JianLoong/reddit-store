Your brother was \"triggered\" by a fictional character on the screen.    Frankly, he was being a jerk.      \nRicky Gervais, comic and athiest, would say your brother was a jerk.    \nAnd for those comments that will surely come, no, this is not a Freedom of Speech thing. Yes, your brother is free to say what he wants, but freedom of speech does not protect him from well-deserved criticism.        \nGood luck with your mom, too - either your brother lied to her about what happened, or her bias is clouding her judgement.

Not a cult?", "How dare you? I am now going to break thing in my bedroom.", "The problem here is that there is a general meaning of the world \"cult\", and there is a modern meaning of the word that is used much more specifically about high-control groups (that don't have to be religious, but very often are).\n\nIf I talk to you about ancient Greek religion and the Eleusinian mysteries cult, I'm using the word in a general sense.\n\nIf I talk about Scientology being a cult, I'm using the word to mean a group that uses a variety of psychological techniques and psychological coercion, and sometimes physical coercion, to keep people within the cult.  It's a specific meaning.\n\nIn the second category, cults are defined by meeting specific criteria, and they share a lot in common with abusive relationships.  They isolate their members from contact with people outside of the cult.  They control who members can interact with, as well as a wide variety of member behaviors.  If members have family within the cult, then they are threatened with shunning if they leave (cut off from all future contact with family members).  If they do not have family within the cult, then cult leaders will use psychological manipulation to damage their relationship with family members, to make it harder for family to convince the person to leave the cult.  They may use physical coercion, such as imprisonment, to keep people within the cult. They often do use things like financial control (so that someone who wants to leave the cult does not have access to money that would help them leave or survive on their own).  And, they make use of \"secret\" in-knowledge, prohibiting members of the cult from revealing that knowledge to outsiders.  Often this is because it's a scam of some kind, but it's also because, psychologically, sharing a secret within a group and being prohibited from sharing it outside the group can be a powerful manipulative tool.\n\nChristianity, broadly speaking, is not a cult, under that definition. And that's why people are pointing out that a huge number of Christians can choose the level at which they interact with their denomination or church (whatever the main social focus is).  There are a high number of people who were raised Christian, but who become only casual members of their religion as they get older, or some who become agnostic or atheists.  \n\n\\*Generally speaking\\*, while you might get into an argument with your more faithful parents over how religious you are as an adult, and while you might be threatened on an individual level with being shunned by family members, very few Christian sects practice shunning or control over behavior to the same degree that cults do, especially on an official, organizational level.  Like, on the individual church level, priests and pastors might heavily encourage you to attend services every week; but in practical terms, nothing will happen to you if you don't, besides some mild chastizing.  You won't be barred from entering the church again. Your family and other members of the church won't shun you until you do as the priest tells you.  And that's the reality that most Christians in America live in.\n\nThose Christian sects that do use high-control techniques generally do get labelled as cults, in order to make that point.  (You see it with JWs, and the LDS.)\n\nIf OP's brother was just using \"cult\" in the neutral, descriptive way, then that would be one thing. But he's clearly not.  He mean \"cult\" in a perjorative way -- he's one of those people who think anyone who has any kind of religious belief is delusional.  He is, of course, free to believe that himself.  But berating someone else for THEIR beliefs makes him an asshole.", "Jeff Bezos is one boredom filled day away from paying for a 500ft tall statue to be made of him and placed on a diamond floating in the sky.\n\nI'm genuinely surprised he hasn't just announced his plans to destroy the world already, not like anyones gonna stop him.\n\n\"We have the American and British army ready to fight you\"\n\n\"I've hired every PMC in the world, and Elon's made me Securitrons straight out of Fallout\"", "I didn\u2019t bother reading any after that because of how fake it sounded.", "I once encountered a Christian who asserted that we know that the events in the New Testament literally happened and that Christianity is the true religion because, after all, towns like Bethlehem really exist.\n\nI've never encountered \"if Bethlehem, then Bible\" before or since, but it certainly was... memorable.\n\nOf course, on the flipside you sometimes encounter atheists who really get *irrationally angry* at the idea of historical Jesus, especially if you point out that there's about as much evidence for historical Socrates as historical Jesus. I am reasonably certain that this is because, on some level, they think that if they agree that most historians, including atheist historians or historians of non-Abrahamic religions, consider \"no historical Jesus\" to be super fringey then they're agreeing that Christianity is therefore the correct belief system.\n\nBut no, historical Jesus does not mean historical *miracles* or God or Heaven and Hell.
