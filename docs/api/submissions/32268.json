Your brother was \"triggered\" by a fictional character on the screen.    Frankly, he was being a jerk.      \nRicky Gervais, comic and athiest, would say your brother was a jerk.    \nAnd for those comments that will surely come, no, this is not a Freedom of Speech thing. Yes, your brother is free to say what he wants, but freedom of speech does not protect him from well-deserved criticism.        \nGood luck with your mom, too - either your brother lied to her about what happened, or her bias is clouding her judgement.
