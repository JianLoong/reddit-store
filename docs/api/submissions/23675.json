If your children know that you are prone to getting emotional and blowing up, then they will continue to hide from you in order to protect themselves.

You should always deal with kids sober and as in control of your emotions as possible.  \n\nSo your older kid kept your younger kid safe and well.

You scream at him and punish him for\u2026 keeping his little brother safe? For being a trusted safety net for him as he grows into adulthood? He had work the next day.

So, while I disagree with your response, I definitely understand it. \n\nYour eldest absolutely should have called you and this other kid\u2019s parents straight away and offered to let the boys stay with him until you and them, but who actually prepares for this sort of situation?  The closest I ever got to that level of preparation was telling my kids that if they\u2019re ever at a party where people are getting drunk or high, they should call me to come get them if they or their ride are intoxicated because they\u2019ll be in less trouble for being responsible enough to call me than getting into a car with an intoxicated driver or spending the night somewhere I don\u2019t know they are. \n\nAll that being said, your oldest did what he thought was responsible by keeping them somewhere safe. Perhaps you can ease the tension by agreeing that the boys were safe, blowing up at your oldest wasn\u2019t the way to go, and in the future you (and any other relevant parents) ought to get a phone call immediately, even if you\u2019re going to leave a wayward child in place until it\u2019s convenient to get them.", "YTA\n\nBased on your post you seem explosive and controlling.

And apparently whatever you're doing for parenting has scared him enough not to trust you and to go find his brother instead", "YTA - your kids are going to gradually and constantly distance themselves from you because you have a SERIOUS anger problem. \n\nYour oldest son's cool head obviously didn't come from you.", "If you had any options besides screaming, then you are most certainly the asshole.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Joseph is not to blame here. And you should take a look at your own behavior. Your kids don't feel safe enough telling you anything and they can't rely on you. You are 100% responsible for having created such a shitty atmosphere that you kids avoid you.", "YTA. Instead of yelling at Joseph, you should be thanking him- what an incredibly kind, respectful, and mature older brother. He took care of his brother and brother\u2019s boyfriend.

I'm not.", "I understand that you were worried but your children don\u2019t trust you when they\u2019re vulnerable. Both of them. You need to work on your anger sir before you lose your sons.

Do better. YTA", "YTA. You are mad at the wrong son, IMO. If you make a huge stink out of this, next time Ian won't be somewhere as safe. \n\nYou should apologize to Joseph and explain you reacted poorly out of worry, but that you are so grateful he took care of his brother and his friend in the meantime.

He's not their father but that was his house. He has a right to choose who he lets into his own place. Plus at 4 am when he had work in the morning, it was probably the easiest thing for everybody at that point. He gave your son a safe place to sleep it off. By all means, be mad at Ian today but Joseph didn't do anything wrong", "YTA. He isn\u2019t a parent and he has to work the next morning.

Then you proved them right. \n\nGo get your shit together. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Seems like your own sons are afraid to call you for help because of your anger issues. You need to tone down and realize that he found a safe place to spend the night.

She would rather us call her than to pass out in the woods and die because we were too afraid to go home. \n\nThe next day after the hangover, she would thank us for calling her and told us she loved us. She never wanted us to drink like that, but we were stupid kids and did what stupid kids did. Your kids are going to remember this.

I highly doubt it but one can hope", "ESH\n\nOlder son should have called you, but the fact that youngest son is afraid of your reaction speaks volumes about your temper.

After you knew that he was safe, however,I do think you missed a more concerning point. Both of your sons are uncomfortable telling you things that you need to know as a parent out of fear.

YTA.", "YTA, your son was protecting your other son from the temper you demonstrated on the phone. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if he went low contact or no contact", "You are low on the list for any parenting trophy. First of all, none are of drinking age. You let a 15yo go out drinking?  Oh, he has a 16yo boyfriend?  A 20yo takes them in\u2026..", "Yes", "YTA. I grew up with a Dad like you. I don\u2019t talk to him much since I left home over 20+ yrs ago. I bet your kids do the same.", "ESH\n\nKid shouldn't have gone out. Oldest should have texted or called. You should have kept your temper in check instead of making kids regret telling you anything so increasing the likelihood of repeat offenses.", "YTA. Your 20 year old\u2019s job is to be a safe place for your you get kid to come when he needs help/safety or whatever. Just because he\u2019s technically an adult doesn\u2019t mean he has to be the parent. Also how cool that your kid felt safe to crash with his brother. Don\u2019t screw up a good thing.", "YTA because of exactly this.  You haven't fostered a relationship of any trust.  Because of your temper. They don't feel safe with you like that. Reflect on that for a bit", "My mom had strict parents. So did her friends. Not surprising that a few of them died trying to get home without their parents noticing because they how they\u2019d react. That could easily be OPs kid one day", "THIS...a quick text would have been easy. 'hey, they're here and safe, you can pick them up later' That would have been a ten second way to keep parents from panicking. If you don't have the bf's parents' #, at least texting your own will get the message out there. In this world, ANYTHING could have happened to those boys. While dad DEFINITELY is TA and DEFINITELY overreacted, I would probably have done something along the same lines if it were my kids.", "Exactly this, Im sure most of us have story's of getting caught drinking in high school, most parents will ether yell and scream or sit their kids down and have a real conversation. \n\nI was 15 when I was caught with 4 other friends by his mom and dad. They did not yell at any of us, instead they told us the dangers of it on our devolving body's but also talked about moderation, how you position a drunk friend who is sleeping it off so they dont choke on their own vomit. They also gave us the \"i know you will probably do it anyways, but do it in a safe environment that you know and call one of us to pick you up no questions asked if you ever feel unsafe\"", "My parents went a different way. I was allowed to drink anything I wanted, as young as...14 or so... but once I started, I wasn't allowed to leave the house. My parents would rather supervise a drunk kid than worry about what we were being given elsewhere. Also, I was told that if there were any other...substances...I wanted to try, once I turned 18, all I had to do was tell my dad what I wanted to try, and he'd get it and do it with me. Seriously took ALL the fun out of all the stupid shit I could have done in high school.", "My strongest memories of my father\u2026 purple face screaming at me and my siblings.  He probably did ok things, but this is what I remember.  Went LC as soon as I could.  Get yourself in hand and see a therapist for emotional identification and regulation.", "When the oldest child said he was protecting his brother from his fathers blow up\u2026 that\u2019s a clear indication it\u2019s not the first time"]}
