If your children know that you are prone to getting emotional and blowing up, then they will continue to hide from you in order to protect themselves.

You scream at him and punish him for\u2026 keeping his little brother safe? For being a trusted safety net for him as he grows into adulthood? He had work the next day.

So, while I disagree with your response, I definitely understand it. \n\nYour eldest absolutely should have called you and this other kid\u2019s parents straight away and offered to let the boys stay with him until you and them, but who actually prepares for this sort of situation?  The closest I ever got to that level of preparation was telling my kids that if they\u2019re ever at a party where people are getting drunk or high, they should call me to come get them if they or their ride are intoxicated because they\u2019ll be in less trouble for being responsible enough to call me than getting into a car with an intoxicated driver or spending the night somewhere I don\u2019t know they are. \n\nAll that being said, your oldest did what he thought was responsible by keeping them somewhere safe. Perhaps you can ease the tension by agreeing that the boys were safe, blowing up at your oldest wasn\u2019t the way to go, and in the future you (and any other relevant parents) ought to get a phone call immediately, even if you\u2019re going to leave a wayward child in place until it\u2019s convenient to get them.", "YTA\n\nBased on your post you seem explosive and controlling.

And apparently whatever you're doing for parenting has scared him enough not to trust you and to go find his brother instead", "YTA - your kids are going to gradually and constantly distance themselves from you because you have a SERIOUS anger problem. \n\nYour oldest son's cool head obviously didn't come from you.", "If you had any options besides screaming, then you are most certainly the asshole.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Joseph is not to blame here. And you should take a look at your own behavior. Your kids don't feel safe enough telling you anything and they can't rely on you. You are 100% responsible for having created such a shitty atmosphere that you kids avoid you.", "YTA. Instead of yelling at Joseph, you should be thanking him- what an incredibly kind, respectful, and mature older brother. He took care of his brother and brother\u2019s boyfriend.

I'm not.", "I understand that you were worried but your children don\u2019t trust you when they\u2019re vulnerable. Both of them. You need to work on your anger sir before you lose your sons.

Do better. YTA", "YTA. You are mad at the wrong son, IMO. If you make a huge stink out of this, next time Ian won't be somewhere as safe. \n\nYou should apologize to Joseph and explain you reacted poorly out of worry, but that you are so grateful he took care of his brother and his friend in the meantime.

He's not their father but that was his house. He has a right to choose who he lets into his own place. Plus at 4 am when he had work in the morning, it was probably the easiest thing for everybody at that point. He gave your son a safe place to sleep it off. By all means, be mad at Ian today but Joseph didn't do anything wrong", "YTA. He isn\u2019t a parent and he has to work the next morning.

Then you proved them right. \n\nGo get your shit together. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Seems like your own sons are afraid to call you for help because of your anger issues. You need to tone down and realize that he found a safe place to spend the night.

She would rather us call her than to pass out in the woods and die because we were too afraid to go home. \n\nThe next day after the hangover, she would thank us for calling her and told us she loved us. She never wanted us to drink like that, but we were stupid kids and did what stupid kids did. Your kids are going to remember this.

I highly doubt it but one can hope", "ESH\n\nOlder son should have called you, but the fact that youngest son is afraid of your reaction speaks volumes about your temper.

After you knew that he was safe, however,I do think you missed a more concerning point. Both of your sons are uncomfortable telling you things that you need to know as a parent out of fear.

Even stuff like I prefer this over that. In my dad\u2019s mind, his POV is the only one that\u2019s right (one time I said I liked mojitos and they were delicious, he went crazy, talking very loudly and almost screaming about how no one could possibly enjoy the taste of alcoholic beverages and people only liked getting drunk, but I do enjoy the taste of mojitos or sweet wine).\n\nI really want to go LC as soon as I can. I hope OP reflects on his attitude. With my mom I feel heard, and I can ask her for help and advice always. Even when I fuck up and need her help, when I know she will scold me or have a serious conversation, she is still an adult that can communicate and use words and don\u2019t go directly to anger mode, which is why I trust her. I don\u2019t feel like that with my dad.", "A non-asshole way to handle it would have been to say (not shout) \"I was worried when I woke up in the morning.

At least a quick text. But the again, with the anger issues op probably has, op would have probably started something as soon as seeing the message. Driving over, trying to call eldest or youngest in the middle of the night, etc. Eldest probably had enough experience with op to decide to not text in that situation", "> ...a quick text would have been easy. 'hey, they're here and safe, you can pick them up later' That would have been a ten second way to keep parents from panicking. \n\nWell, for a reasonably good parent I'd definitely agree. But that doesn't seem to be OP. Kid seems to have gone to gis brother for a reason and brother didn't contact OP early for a reason. They clearly knew what they were in for. Seems like if he's sent that text then OP would come yell at the drunk teenager at 4am.", "Sneaking out to a party and getting plastered is dangerous. A yelling at is pretty understandable.

Sure, wait until they are 18 when continuing to do those same irresponsible things, which suddenly results in jail time.\n\nAs a parent, your role is not to be your child's best friend. It is to educate them and equip them with the skills needed to function as an adult. One of the things all kids need to learn is that actions have consequences. In this case, the son knowingly left at night and then got drunk when he is legally not allowed to. He put himself in physical danger by doing this. As a consequence, the parent can decide on an appropriate punishment. \n\nSure you can have a conversation about why you are being punished etc, but in my house growing up my parents would always talk to me about why I was being punished. Too many people wringly think that it is an either or situation. Even in the list progressive countries where rehabilitation is preferred.

I flat out told my high school brother that if he ever drank and needed a ride, call me. I lived at home even, and while I told him that he really shouldn\u2019t drink but if he was ever in trouble I\u2019d get him and wouldn\u2019t tell our parents. In fact I\u2019d cover. Because I\u2019d lived with them and learned it wasn\u2019t safe to go to them with mistakes. Bad decisions were met with increasingly long grounding. I went from an A student to a D student when I entered high school. They knew I was self harming and depressed but their response was to ground me because of my grades not figure out what was wrong. \n\nMy parents found out this year that my 30 year old brother spent hours after school alone with a girl from his school, which wasn\u2019t allowed, as soon as he could drive. That\u2019s how he met the friend who\u2019s a sister to him and introduced him to his wife. They had no idea he was really close with her mom too. \n\nYelling like that doesn\u2019t change behavior. It creates sneaky kids who learn to hide everything and when they\u2019re literally at the development age where they can\u2019t really control their impulses, that can be dangerous. I\u2019m 34 and the damage is still there in that relationship.", "Sure, but as OP so ably demonstrates, that yelling is really more about making the yeller feel power and authority than about creating constructive behaviour change. Most yellers wont be on this level, but their yelling isn\u2019t more effective as a result.\n\nCase is point: OPs son knows OP has anger management issues. The son solves this by not going home and not by refraining from going out.", "Especially when you're expecting a kid home and they don't return. That's easily something worth calling the policr over if you're not getting responses.", "YTA\n\nAsk yourself why your drunk kid didn't feel safe calling you for a ride?", "Just so you know my father did exactly what you did and myself and my siblings don\u2019t talk to him nor has he met his grandkids.

I can fully understand why your younger son avoided coming back home to you. And why your eldest let them sleep it off. He showed more responsibility than you. And yes he was working later. He dealt with this far better than you. He had NOTHING to apologise for. You however need to eat a shitload of humble pie. Man up and apologise to him for your hysterical bullshit. I can foresee your younger son leaving as soon as he can because you are a nasty bully.", "Yes YTA\n\nAll I hear is that you're screaming at everyone and everything and can't control your temper.\n\nDo you lose your temper this much at work?", "OMG how can big brother taking care of little brother shame on him.

God you sound insufferable.  Its maybe why they sneak out and don't tell you things.", "You sure you're not the 15 year old? Because your control of your emotions and temper are that of a teenager. Actually more like a toddler, grow up for Christ sake. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nIf your first response is to scream at your son, and now you're here several hours later at AITA, then you need to know that *this* is the reason your children didn't call you at any point during this event.\n\nAnd you *were* wrong to call him at work. If your response had been justified, it could've waited until the end of the workday.", "I\u2019m a parent of teenage sons and YTA. I\u2019d rather know that my sons have somewhere they feel safe to go to when they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble with me.

Do we all have kids or just speaking from experience with angry fathers? I think he could have handled the situation better, but I can say that I would have been pretty upset about this as well. Maybe OP has had issues with the boy breaking the rules repeatedly. The boys were underage, btw. 15 and 16 years old, and they are out getting trashed and staying out all night? I'm willing to bet that this wasn't the first time something like this has happened. Maybe OP lost his temper because he is tired of dealing with unruly kids? \n\nI feel like more information is needed before an AH/NTA ruling can be made.  In my mind, he had ever right to be pissed.", "YTA screaming at your oldest for taking care of your youngest is honestly the dumbest thing I can think of right now.

Screaming at anyone makes YTA. Screaming at your own kid makes you an extra AH.

Screaming is not an acceptable problem-solving solution for any adult.", "YTA it was 4am", "Info: Why did you scream? Why didn't you just tell him to give you a call next time?", "YTA your temper is so bad the older brother didn't feel safe calling you.

They always dealt with it seriously, quietly but sternly. \n\nI knew I could ALWAYS come home after a night of sneaking out, partying, whatever. My home was the one our friends would crash at to avoid their parents. \n\nI\u2019m almost 30 now and forever grateful that my parents made me feel like I could always come home no matter the time, what state I was in, how much trouble I\u2019d get into.

They don't trust you. You are not their safe space. They don't trust you to have their back and protect them without yelling at them when they need you. Instead of meeting them in the middle and allowing them to do what young people do, and just arming them with the knowledge they need to stay safe without you, and making sure they know that you will always be there for them, you are just a source of punishment and judgement. I hope you're prepared to never hear from them once they free themselves from your anger issues.", "Dude, you know yta. They were in a safe place. They told you the next day. Your over exaggerated fear and anger towards your oldest was inappropriate. Seek therapy or, better yet, a psychiatrist.", "YTA\n\nCongratulations, your children are scared of you. Bet you feel a right big man of the house now mate.", "YTA. You can\u2019t expect your son to choose between you and his brother. That isn\u2019t ok. He made sure his brother was ok. It wasn\u2019t your oldest son\u2019s responsibility to call it was Ian\u2019s responsibility but he got off the hook easy.   Joseph isn\u2019t the parent, you are.

You are also forcing them into a position where they lie or hide things from you, and are therefore LESS safe because they cannot trust you and will sneak around to try and avoid you and your reactions. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna lose your kids.

To my mum? No). And if I think really really hard I can rember some moments when he was an ok person.
