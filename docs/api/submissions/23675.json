If your children know that you are prone to getting emotional and blowing up, then they will continue to hide from you in order to protect themselves.

You should always deal with kids sober and as in control of your emotions as possible.  \n\nSo your older kid kept your younger kid safe and well.

You scream at him and punish him for\u2026 keeping his little brother safe? For being a trusted safety net for him as he grows into adulthood? He had work the next day.

So, while I disagree with your response, I definitely understand it. \n\nYour eldest absolutely should have called you and this other kid\u2019s parents straight away and offered to let the boys stay with him until you and them, but who actually prepares for this sort of situation?  The closest I ever got to that level of preparation was telling my kids that if they\u2019re ever at a party where people are getting drunk or high, they should call me to come get them if they or their ride are intoxicated because they\u2019ll be in less trouble for being responsible enough to call me than getting into a car with an intoxicated driver or spending the night somewhere I don\u2019t know they are. \n\nAll that being said, your oldest did what he thought was responsible by keeping them somewhere safe. Perhaps you can ease the tension by agreeing that the boys were safe, blowing up at your oldest wasn\u2019t the way to go, and in the future you (and any other relevant parents) ought to get a phone call immediately, even if you\u2019re going to leave a wayward child in place until it\u2019s convenient to get them.", "YTA\n\nBased on your post you seem explosive and controlling.

And apparently whatever you're doing for parenting has scared him enough not to trust you and to go find his brother instead", "YTA - your kids are going to gradually and constantly distance themselves from you because you have a SERIOUS anger problem. \n\nYour oldest son's cool head obviously didn't come from you.", "If you had any options besides screaming, then you are most certainly the asshole.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Joseph is not to blame here. And you should take a look at your own behavior. Your kids don't feel safe enough telling you anything and they can't rely on you. You are 100% responsible for having created such a shitty atmosphere that you kids avoid you.", "YTA. Instead of yelling at Joseph, you should be thanking him- what an incredibly kind, respectful, and mature older brother. He took care of his brother and brother\u2019s boyfriend.

I'm not.", "I understand that you were worried but your children don\u2019t trust you when they\u2019re vulnerable. Both of them. You need to work on your anger sir before you lose your sons.

Do better. YTA", "YTA. You are mad at the wrong son, IMO. If you make a huge stink out of this, next time Ian won't be somewhere as safe. \n\nYou should apologize to Joseph and explain you reacted poorly out of worry, but that you are so grateful he took care of his brother and his friend in the meantime.

He's not their father but that was his house. He has a right to choose who he lets into his own place. Plus at 4 am when he had work in the morning, it was probably the easiest thing for everybody at that point. He gave your son a safe place to sleep it off. By all means, be mad at Ian today but Joseph didn't do anything wrong", "YTA. He isn\u2019t a parent and he has to work the next morning.

Then you proved them right. \n\nGo get your shit together. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Seems like your own sons are afraid to call you for help because of your anger issues. You need to tone down and realize that he found a safe place to spend the night.

She would rather us call her than to pass out in the woods and die because we were too afraid to go home. \n\nThe next day after the hangover, she would thank us for calling her and told us she loved us. She never wanted us to drink like that, but we were stupid kids and did what stupid kids did. Your kids are going to remember this.

I highly doubt it but one can hope", "ESH\n\nOlder son should have called you, but the fact that youngest son is afraid of your reaction speaks volumes about your temper.

After you knew that he was safe, however,I do think you missed a more concerning point. Both of your sons are uncomfortable telling you things that you need to know as a parent out of fear.

You don\u2019t get to scream at ANYONE particularly your son because you are upset.  \n\nLet\u2019s review what your elder son did correctly;  he took those two wasted idiots in at 4AM potentially saving their health, if not their lives.  He also probably took a ration of shit about it from his girlfriend.", "Your reaction to this incident is why Joseph didn't call you. Please focus on your anger issues before trying to parent your teenager.", "Yes, YTAH.  Your kids don't trust you and for good reason.", "YTA do you see with your \u201crighteous anger\u201d why instead of coming home your son ran to his brother\u2019s apartment when he was drunk. Do you see why your older son took in the younger and didn\u2019t call you immediately? You behaved like an ass, there is a definitive line between being stern and being abusive and if you haven\u2019t crossed the line you are teetering on the edge. Take this time to reexamine and hopefully fix your relationship with your children.", "As being a parent and worrying like you did. You let your emotions take over and not realize that nothing bad happened to Ian and Keith. Now when dust settles sit down with Joseph and apologize to him and thank him for Ian and Kieth in his home. But ask him if it happens again please have him call you. NAH", "This is super simple.\n\nIf you had said, I screamed at someone to stop them from walking off a cliff or getting hit by a vehicle or some other life or injury threatening event would probably have been Not the A.\n\nI screamed at\u2026. nope. Nope. Nope Nope. You don\u2019t scream or yell at other humans, ever, because YTA.", "YTA. You clearly have serious anger issues, no wonder they all avoided you", "You shouldn\u2019t be screaming at your adult children at all. Learn to treat them like the adults they are, and speak to them rationally and respectfully, or you\u2019re just going to alienate them. Once they\u2019re grown up and out of the house, they are not \u201cyours\u201d to scold anymore.", "You're absolutely right, your oldest didn't act appropriately. He acted like the kids were both 18 (or 21 if you're in the states).\n\nThe amount of screaming though and the lack of self control. Then combined with your oldest actively avoiding you. Have you created an abusive household?", "Point blank. You are not just TA you ARE AN AH. If your kids fear you to the point they will hide from you like this....that alone should tell you that you need to change. You can be a good father and dad to them without blowing up at them and/or disgracing them. You really should work on fixing yourself before you are struggling to fix a broken relationship with your sons. I wish you the best of luck.", "Why doesn\u2019t your son feel safe talking to you? Why don\u2019t your SONS feel safe talking to you?", "Yta", "YTA, your temper isn't helping anything. Yelling and screaming is ridiculous and doesn't solve anything. \n\nIf you can't have a calm conversation with your own children then expect no contact when they're older", "If he had texted to let you know would you have let them sleep or would you have insisted on coming and getting them and probably yelling anyway? \nI understand the fear/worry, but you are likely the reason why he didn\u2019t call.", "They should have texted or the older brother should have called to let the parents know that they were safe at his place I can totally appreciate the worry this caused.  Just remember, the madder you get, the less likely they will engage you.  The oldest was afraid that if they told you where they were, you\u2019d get pissed, call the brother, pop by and get them and he HS to work the next day.  I a, sure he was not thrilled to have them on his doorstep at 4am.  \n\nNext time it happens, they need to let you know.", "YTA. Do you seriously wonder why your kids obviously aren't comfortable telling you things?", "YTA. You are an abusive asshole. Clearly your kids are terrified of you. It sounds like you scream at them on a regular basis. That's not discipline; that's abuse. That makes you a bad parent and a nasty asshole.", "YTA", "YTA. I can see why Keith didn\u2019t tell you and I can see why Ian went to his brother instead of coming home. You\u2019re an AH and your kids are scared of you. I can understand that you were worried but you called Keith to SCREAM at him while he was at work when he was just looking after his brother, you owe him a big apology", "Your kids need to know if they get drunk and need a ride him, that they can call you and you will come and get them and take them home with no big blow up that night. Because if they\u2019re scared to call you, it\u2019s no telling how they\u2019ll get home. Or if they\u2019ll make it home alive.\n\nYou really don\u2019t want to get a phone call from a cop in the middle of the night saying your kid was in a wreck and hopefully is in the hospital instead of the morgue.\n\nThat\u2019s if your bottom line is that your kid stays alive.\n\nIf you\u2019re more concerned with being \u201cright\u201d or laying down the law or being obeyed, you\u2019re going to have a tough time during your kid\u2019s teenage years.\n\nThe other thing to consider \u2014 your kid will be 18 soon, maybe off on his own at college. You will not be there to lay down the law. They\u2019ll be making their own decisions. So your job now is to teach them how to make good decisions and slowly give them more and more decisions of their own to make while they\u2019re still living in your house with you to guide and teach them.", "YTA, with some serious rage issues.\n\nYOUR KIDS DON\u2019T FEEL SAFE TELLING YOU BAD NEWS", "You can expect them to obey you without question, but you can't actually make them. Soon, you will lose what little leverage you have over your younger son to force him to bend to your will, and you won't have any children coming home at all. Or calling you or inviting you to be a part of their lives anymore. \n\nThey are telling you why you aren't being trusted or kept in the loop. You blow up. You make them scared instead of safe. You aren't teaching them to make better choices, only to avoid you. \n\nTry treating them like actual people and not possessions whose feelings are far inferior to your own. Look around you and realize how many authoritarian assholes are losing contact with their children as soon as they leave the nest. \n\nAs a parent, I probably wouldn't have called you either. I would have prioritized the child's well-being (and I also wouldn't have wanted to deal with a man who can't keep his emotions in check in the middle of the night.) I had a father who I would have rathered slept outside than bear his anger when I was already in a vulnerable state, and I couldn't put another person through thay if they had come to me for shelter.", "YTA - your temper is atrocious and it's obvious your children are afraid of you.  Your older son was protecting his little brother from his verbally abusive dad.", "That reaction right there is why they went to Joseph\u2019s. I\u2019d sneak and hide shit from you too. You need a counselor to help you learn how to foster a trusting environment in your home so your kid(s) don\u2019t feel the need to be sneaky around you. My mom and I had a super open and trusting relationship and as a result I was allowed to stay out super late as a teen. Because she trusted me I did everything I could to maintain that trust because it\u2019s fun hang with your friends at 3 am when you\u2019re a teenager. I didn\u2019t drink or do drugs until college and that was really from pressure due to the environment. YTA.", "Any parent who screams shouldn\u2019t be surprised that their kids will do anything and everything to avoid them when they\u2019ve messed up.\n\nShould he have contacted you? Yeah. But take a look in the mirror. You have monstrous anger problems, and you need to check yourself. \n\nYTA", "YTA", "YTA. Kids don\u2019t sneak out and avoid telling their parents things to avoid a temper tantrum when they have reasonable level headed parents. Just saying.", "YTA Treat your kids with respect consistently, they would give you the heads up.  You earned what you got.", "YTA, you also have anger management issues.", "YTA, no wonder your oldest is trying to protect his brother. You need some significant anger management dude. By the time you\u2019re as old as you are, you should be able to manage your own feelings", "You're the Asshole. Getting mad at someone that didn't cause the issue.", "YTA maybe you should consider why your children are so scared of you and why your oldest feels the need to protect his brother from you? Yeah, obviously his brother shouldn't have snuck out and drank. However, it's not surprising considering the hostile and toxic home environment it sounds like you've been fostering. It sounds like you need to work on your anger management, emotion regulation, and communication skills. Therapy might help.", "YTA. I see why they didn't tell you.", "YTA. Would you have preferred a wake up knock on the door at 5 am from the police saying they had been in a fatal car accident? That is what many parents have woken up to. I realize you had a 2 hours of worry but be realistic. Deal with the reality that the eldest, who is still growing up himself, provided a safe place that was free from judgement that they felt safe going to.", "YTA\n\nYour oldest is trying to protect your youngest from you. Maybe take the hint?", "YTA and I feel like you have some serious anger management issues that should be looked into. Screaming at children when they mess up and invoking fear is not a healthy parenting strategy. You should be grateful your oldest son is a \u201csafe space\u201d who Ian feels comfortable turning to.", "YIKES YTA", "YTA\n\nYour oldest was just being a good brother. They were safe at his place, and a good brother isn't going to immediately tattle on his siblings just for the heck of it.\n\nHe was giving them some what they could trust in a place they could be safe. He was maintaining his brotherly bond.\n\nYou should be a lot more understanding and grateful towards him.", "YTA  You instilled love and care and the need to protect his brother from hostile people. Even if that hostile person is his own father. He could have just sent his brother on his way not caring what happened to him. Instead he took care of him at 4 in the morning. If he had called you would have shown up blowing up at everyone showing no care for anyone but how it inconvenienced you. \n\nYour older son had to work the next day, he didn't want your screaming keeping him up all night. But you really don't care about older son either because you didn't care that you were interrupting his work because he was going to listen to you ranting whether he wanted to or not. How would you have reacted if your son called you at work to scream at you? \n\nYour uncaring attitude and explosive temper is the reason your younger son didn't feel he could call you instead of going to his brother. He even ran from you as soon as you got home. Doesn't that tell you something about yourself when your own son runs from you.", "You called him at work and spoke to him like that? YTA. Calm the fuck down.", "YTA. Your unhinged response is why they went to Joseph. No good would've come from them calling you.", "Soft YTA- I understand that you were scared, but he is not their parent and was entitled to a lapse in judgement. He took care of his brother and made sure they were safe. Perhaps you need to reflect on your fear and anxiety manifesting as anger, it can make your teens less likely to trust you in these moments when they mess up and need a safe place to land. One mom to another, I get it, but apologize to your oldest for your reaction.", "YTA. No wonder they don\u2019t tell you anything. You\u2019re a maniac.", "Funny how often dads post here asking the sub to validate their angry overreaction at family lying to them or keeping them out of the loop. Seems like most of the time the rest of the family is hiding something expressly because they knew the blow up was coming. If your family doesn't trust you not to react with inappropriate anger, what does that tell you?", "YTA- your reaction is exactly why none of your kids confided in you at the time. Your eldest was already dealing with two drunk teenagers. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t wanna put up with your drama to.", "OP's kids are so scared of him that they would go to a great extend to avoid confrontation with them. OP's worry for kids should not translate to blatant yelling. \n\nJoseph didn't call because he didn't want his drunk brother to be sent to you for getting yelled at. He didn't call in the morning because he knew how you would react to this and hence the gf picked up the tab. And, Lo and behold, you did exactly what they thought you would do, OP - scream. \n\nYTA.", "This is my take on it too. They went to the brother because they knew quite well what would happen if they went home. The brother kept quiet about it because he also knew how OP would react. The brother was just being a good sibling and giving them a safe place to go and a person they could trust to not blow up on them.\n\nHysterical anger is rarely the right way to respond to something your kid has done, especially if it's something relatively normal or mundane/something that's a normal part of growing up.", ">However, all you are teaching them is to avoid you at all cost.\n\nAnd possibly avoiding the older brother. Even though brother had their back and kept them safe, if it happens again, chances of them going to his house may be slim now, just because they don't want him mixed in the middle of their dummy teenage decisions, and getting yelled at too, as if he's a child. \n\nI get the initial freak out. I would too, not knowing what happened to my son, but once I found out he was safe, that's when we'd talk and see why he felt like he couldn't come home/ call me, and be thankful that he went to a trust adults house- opposed to who knows what!", "YTA, this comment really says it all. What kind of parent do you want to be, OP?", "That \"quick message\" would have likely had OP storming Joseph's door at 4AM.  I don't blame him for not sending it.  \n\nOP is a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" sort of parent, so may as well do what you want.", "More likely she noticed when the youngest called for a ride home. Otherwise she would have been calling Joseph to see if he's heard from his brother as one would do when their kid is missing and isn't answering the phone.", "Bammm", "Best response... We really don't know if Dad always yells or creates a hostile environment.  My kids don't tell me things because of disappointment and their own guilt... their mom was the yeller and I was the spoke with reason... but I don't get calls because of their own guilty conscience. And yes, both now adults have told me so. There are going to be times when getting through to your kids and young adults takes a bit more heat to get your point across. Do you think they will not call the next time... I think they will. IF this was out of character for Dad...", "His child disappeared overnight and he was upset about it?\n\nIt's one thing to say he went overboard. To sneer that he needs therapy tells me you've never been a parent.", "I'm wondering if Joseph DID send that text, if OP would have raced over to Joseph's house and screamed at EVERYONE. Because OP seems like quite the screamer.", "Probably did after the teenagers woke up", "Yeah, and idk about others but  IMO being yelled around 4am before having to head in to work. ARG.\n\nIf OP is as bad as my dad that anger would last a loooong time, and so would his lectures.  Not only would he rush over nad demand to pick up the \"kids\" and blow up at everyone involved, but  it would be like 2-3 hours of lost sleep. not exactly a great way to start a working day.", "Oh yeah I\u2019m saying in the morning.  At like 9am or donut OP was working and dunno if they had time.\n\nYea OP is the type that if a someone was in trouble they\u2019d be afraid to go to him.  Reminds me on Kobra Kai where Daniels daughter got drunk.  He found out where she was and went storming over there.", "\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I can only speak to my own experience. My dad yelled a lot when I was a kid. I hated the way that felt. I\u2019m also a larger man, and I\u2019m aware that I can be scary if I lose my temper. So, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to make sure I don\u2019t, and when I do, I also try to own it.", "We do know - OP says  that his eldest didn\u2019t call at 4am \u201cto avoid me blowing up at (youngest)\u201d. \n\nApparently even when writing it out in his post, he cannot see that this is the exact reason neither boy phoned dad to let him know what was going on. \n\nDad doesn\u2019t know how to control his temper, and is absolutely the AH here.", "Adults need to manage their behaviour and emotions. Being upset and worried is fine, screaming at people because you are upset is not. If OP can't regulate his behaviour when he is upset, he likely needs to see a professional for help figuring it out.", "I am a parent and it most definitely tells me he needs therapy. If my child was terrified to come to me and a family member thought they needed to protect him from my temper then I have failed as a parent and definitely need to receive therapy.\n\nEdited to add: YTA 100%", "I\u2019m not sure we need to wonder. \n\nThe original post says oldest didn\u2019t call to avoid dad \u201cblowing up\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly the default reaction from OP & the reason he\u2019s losing or lost his relationship with both of these boys. He\u2019s definitely the AH in this situation.", "I was wondering that too but I do still think Joseph did have an obligation to let his parents know that his minor brother was safe and not dead in a ditch somewhere. Regardless what you think of OP it must have been a very stressful morning", "I definitely hear you on this one... As I mentioned, if Dad wasn't a yeller, then you kinda proved my point... Some of us go the opposite way of our parents to be better people per sey.  But even we lose our kool when the safety of our loved ones are in question. And kids don't understand that anguish until they have kids... and worry everyday for their safety. Good job on recognizing your possible effects on people. \ud83d\ude42", "Terrified? Sounds like OP was mad that his kid didn't call. At 15, I certainly made stupid decisions to avoid getting criticized or reprimanded by my parents for other stupid decisions. That doesn't mean my parents were bad, mean people.\n\nThe kid got drunk, went to his brother's house to avoid getting in trouble for getting drunk, and dad understandably yelled at the older brother for not calling.\n\nIf my 9th grade son disappeared with his boyfriend overnight and wasn't back by morning, I'd be worried sick too. And I'd probably get mad to find out that nobody had told me in an effort to cover up drinking.", "He said the older brother stated he was trying to protect his younger brother from his dad you don\u2019t use that term unless a parent has a history of going off the deep end over things. As someone who grew up with a verbally abusive parent this is exactly what I would have done to protect my younger sister from my mom. \n\nAlso as a parent I would be more relieved finding out my child was somewhere safe than calling and verbally abusing the person who kept my kid safe."]}
