His behaviour is disgusting and he has no care in the world for anyone but himself.\n\nHe has no respect for my parents, cusses at my mum all time even though she buys and cooks him food, and he works full time because of a job she got him (he\u2019s 21 btw). On top of that he steals my food and refuses to replace it so I forcefully take cash from him to pay it back which then leads to arguments. Brags to people that he makes more money than me, yet I quit my job to work for myself so of course it\u2019s gonna be slow.\n\nHe once came home early and heard my girlfriend and I in my room going at it, and then proceeded to send a voice memo to my friends about it (they hate him too). Everytime his girlfriend is over he puts a facade on and tells her that I don\u2019t like him because apparently I\u2019m jealous of him. There is way worse things he\u2019s done and the list goes on, but that\u2019s all he\u2019s done just this year\u2026\n\nMy parents are happy for me that I\u2019m moving out, but they\u2019re very against me blocking my brothers number and never wanting to see or hear from him ever again.

They don't want you to do the thing they've been too afraid to do. Your brother sounds like a spoiled jerk and you and your gf don't have to allow him in your life at all. What he did by sending the sound recording of the two of you having sex might be illegal in your state and is beyond disgusting. You're a grown up, you don't have to do what your parents tell you when it comes to this. NTA", "NTA\n\nBro sounds like a disrespectful dick.\n\nAnd your parents coddle him and enables his bad behavior...", "NTA OP. You do you and you have every right to no LC or NC with him. Your parents have no right to make you\n\nMoving forward, make sure you get a PO Box to receive gifts and cards from the parents so that brother does not know where you live and he comes by unannounced.", "NTA... maybe I just need to get off of reddit but I can't see this *not* resulting in brother making a play for OP's land & home (or the parents on brother's behalf).  Yeah it's off grid but bro doesn't need electricity to be a spiteful prick", "NTA. He sounds toxic and potentially dangerous when he gets triggered by anything. So it's a good idea to keep a distance.\n\nThere isn't much point in trying actively to not tell him where you live, though. He will probably find out at some point. So it might be smarter not to freak out when he finds out, and just simply not let him in if he comes knocking. Also do not give anyone your spare keys.\n\nBest way to keep him away might be not making it into a huge conflict but rather just try not to draw too much attention to your exact address. You could even tell him the general area if asked, but make sure he doesn't know when you're moving etc. If he says that he wants to see the place, come up with an excuse, and if he is insistent, just tell him that you want to live your own life and won't have family to visit. You could just not give your parents your address for now. They will not be able to keep your address a secret - the brother is too difficult for that. Parents can visit at a later date when the dust have settled and the brother doesn't know.", "NTA for wanting to remove your brother from your life when you leave the house. I think you might be going a bit overboard with it but you have the right to do it if it makes you feel better. Your parents will, of course, ignore that you want no contact with him and will cause trouble for you. But you can handle it directly or with restraining orders.", ">they didn\u2019t like that one bit telling me I\u2019m selfish and that I should be ashamed\u2026\n\nNo. NTA. Enjoy your new place!", "NTA because you get to continue the adult relationships you want to maintain.  They don't get to choose.\n\nAs portrayed your brother is incredibly toxic, so it is natural you wouldn't want to see him.  That is your choice.\n\nYou are creating boundaries.  He can't have your personal info.  You won't go to gatherings he's at(not that HE can't go to them).", "Putting on a facade is my guess", "Appreciate that :)", "Honestly was talking to a friend who is a lawyer because I wanted to get a form done up so my parents can\u2019t legally give him info about where I live and what I\u2019m doing. Unfortunately it\u2019s a long process and even then, it\u2019s not really doable \ud83d\ude1e", "It\u2019s not just my food he steals, he steals their food too. My dad gets really pissed about it and demands him to go and buy the food he stole, yet he buys only a couple of the things he stole\u2026\n\nOf course I can cuss, I just never cuss at my parents if they do something I don\u2019t like", "What this tells me is that he's going to get OP's address at the snap of a finger.", "He stores cash in his room, so I used it to buy the food he stole from me and gave him the change back", "Feel bad for her because if she stays the facade will drop eventually\u2026\n\nAlso NTA. Its understandable somewhat that parents don\u2019t want their kids being NC but you are not responsible for your parents feelings. They can feel that way but you can still make the decisions that make YOU feel good! Don\u2019t buy into that \u201ebut family\u201c blabla your brother doesnt treat you like you deserve and your parents apparently never gave a lot of fucks either about that, so why should you extend yourself for him/them", "The only way to completely withhold information from your brother is to withhold it from anyone who might give it to him.\n\nIf your parents are not trustworthy, that means they get put on the same information diet.", "Honestly man you should go ahead and buy new locks right now, save yourself a trip to Home Depot when the time comes.", "totally fair, i meant more in a \u201cdo they tell you that you aren\u2019t allowed to cuss\u201d\nYeah i hate to say it man, your bro just sounds like a typical spoiled, golden child.\nYou\u2019re NTA for going NC with him, but your parents will still likely give him all your info", "Maybe, but OP doesn't have to let him in.", "Very true. It\u2019s just a shame that we all know they\u2019re going to immediately betray his confidence."]}
