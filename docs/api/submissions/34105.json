My grandpa was very wealthy but lived pretty modestly. He had luxury items but growing up I didn\u2019t really understand that. So when I really young I\u2019d always be climbing onto my grandpa and trying to play with my watch. He\u2019d always take it off and let me play with the dials. It was just a funny memory. I had no idea the watch was worth a lot of money. When I had just started college my grandpa was planning his estate out. He asked me if there was anything I wanted and I\u2019m not the type of person to ask for money or expect money. So I asked for the watch thinking it would be a nice keep sake and a memory of our time together when he did pass away.\n\nWell last year he unfortunately passed away. He left all of his grandkids including me a large sum of money. He left a couple of things like some valuables to his own children. The money he left me was enough to pay off my student loans and do some other things to help me live comfortable. \n\nThe controversy started when I got the watch. Apparently, and I swear I didn\u2019t know this, the watch was worth a lot of money. My family got pissed that I pretty much got the most out of anyone when you combine the value of the watch and the large sum of money. They immediately tried having the will contested but everything held up. \n\nAbout a month after this all happened and we all cooled down we all sat down and decided that this won\u2019t get in the way of our relationship and that we\u2019ll all be content with what we got. \n\nEvery year our family gets together for christmas. We all get dressed up for christmas dinner. I\u2019m talking suits and ties. So I went with a suit on and wore the watch since it\u2019s probably one of the nicest things I own. I wore it to a bunch of formal events over the past year but this was the first time I wore it in front of my family.\n\nIt was all quiet at first and then the booze started flowing and my uncles lost their shit and were claiming \u201cI\u2019m rubbing it in their faces\u201d. I tuned it out but the day after I got into an argument with them and told them they should just be happy with what they got and leave me alone. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703983776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uuvrf/aita_for_flexing_a_watch_i_got_from_my_grandpa/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't many times to non-family events and the first family event you could wear it to. You did to show it off to everybody. They all knew about the watch. They knew you got it. They were jealous that you got it, upset that you got it and yet you decided to wear it to that event. And even your title flexing the watch. Of course you did it.

They're just sore because you got the watch that I'm guessing they'd been hoping for. They need to get over it though, as you have special memories of it with your grandfather, and he willed it to you because he asked what you wanted, and also you wanted it more for the keepsake memory than its monetary worth.", "What kind of watch?
