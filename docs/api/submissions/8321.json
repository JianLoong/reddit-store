After about two weeks he confessed that he had feelings for me and we started dating. I wanted to keep it private because I didn\u2019t want our relationship to be infiltrated by other people\u2019s gossip, perceptions, etc, I just wanted it to be ours. So, we kept our relationship secret; no one knew about it except for us and his roommates.\n\nI would hang out with my roommate, a friend, and the guy I was seeing sometimes in group settings, but they did not know we were dating.  I was pretty close to my roommate and this friend and we spent a lot of time together. With my roommate, I would insult her (tell her I hate her, to shut up, etc) sarcastically/in a joking way. She would do the same to me (would say fuck you to me in a joking tone). Neither of us ever seemed bothered by it.\n\nAfter the end of my relationship with the guy (it only lasted two months), I mentioned it one time to another friend while my roommate was there. My roommate was surprised since she didn\u2019t know about it. We glossed over it and changed the topic. Later that night, I jokingly said I hated my roommate.\n\nShe didn\u2019t say anything in the moment, but the next morning, she snapped at me. She said I obviously didn\u2019t want to share with her but with our friend I was willing to spill, and if we weren\u2019t actually close, I shouldn\u2019t say those kinds of things (I hate you/shut up) to her because it\u2019s strong language and it\u2019s disrespectful. I said I didn\u2019t have to share things with her if I didn\u2019t want to, and that I was obviously joking when I said those things, that I didn\u2019t know it bothered her but I wouldn\u2019t make jokes like that anymore.\n\nShe later complained to a mutual friend about me for hours that weekend mentioning times that I excluded her from outings. If anything, I actually included her; she is chronically late (often 1 hr+) and my friends often would avoid making plans with her because of it, but I would always ask if she could join. She knew them through me, so if I did not invite her she would not go.\n\nThings were tense and we didn\u2019t talk for two days. I felt uncomfortable since she had raised her voice at me. One time I left for class without acknowledging her and she sent me a message saying \u201care you just going to be fucking weird about things and ignore me? Because if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do make it clear.\u201d\n\nI felt like I was getting shit from her for jokingly saying I hated her but that text was actually disrespectful and strong language. We had an argument where I told her this. She voiced she knew I was always joking but she doesn\u2019t like those kinds of jokes. I thought it was hypocritical since she would say f you to me as a joke. She said she was hurt by me not telling her I was dating the guy.\n\nThough we made up, I still haven\u2019t fully forgiven her for lashing out on me and sending that message. I feel that I should be able to choose to keep a relationship to myself if I want to.

Why were his roommate good enough to know but not your roommate? Also concealing this relationship to this extent to somebody you live with takes effort - it\u2019s different to simply not mentioning your boyfriend at work or if it was long distance and wasn\u2019t around. \n\nThis was deliberate effort and you made a mountain out of a molehill.", "YTA.  By trying to avoid drama, you created it.\n\nNobody is gonna infiltrate your relationship.  That's nuts.", "YTA you say you feel close to your roommate yet you kept a huge chunk of your life from her, it comes across as you don't trust her enough with that information. You don't HAVE to tell anyone anything of course, but keeping such a thing from a close friend is not okay in my opinion, or you're not actually friends.\n\nAlso insult jokes are usually hurtful, you say she usually replied f you, looks like she made her feelings pretty clear on multiple occasions and you never noticed, granted she should have stated early and clearly that she does not enjoy insult jokes, it does not make it okay for you to make these 'jokes' at her expense.", "YTA...his roommates and the other friend could know but she wasn't good enough so didn't got to know?\nWhen something is a secret then don't include others otherwise you aren't keeping a secret you are keeping it for that persons secret.\nShe had every right to be mad at you and you don't have the right to be mad at her", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m all for keeping relationships kind of quiet, but keeping it a secret from everyone is weird and unnecessary. If her \u201cfuck you\u201d was in response to you being a dick to her, then I don\u2019t think she was hypocritical. She was just trying to get you to stop in a language you might understand.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't have to tell the world immediately when you start dating. However you hanged out together with her, a friend and your bf and she was unaware he was your bf. That is just plain weird. And the way she had to find out was even weirder. If you like your roommate, you should have been honest with her. You don't have to tell her after 2 dates, but once you started hanging out together, you should have told her. At that point, is was not your choice anymore to keep it to yourself. I totally understand your roommate and that she thinks you don't like her at all.\n\nEverything else that happened is because you both clearly lack communications skills. And believe me, if you thought her text was disrespectful and strong language. You are going to be in for a surprise when someone uses real disrespectful and strong language.", "You\u2019re not an AH for not telling her, but she\u2019s not wrong for being confused and hurt. The \u201cI hate you\u201d game is a terrible one that obviously easily got confusing. So she thought you were closer than you were and realized that and suddenly the \u201cI hate you\u201d game seems real. \nI think you need to talk. Tell her that you weren\u2019t sure about the guy and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want to tell anyone and obviously it didn\u2019t last very long and reassure her that you like her and want to be friends. She\u2019s right that the insult stuff is ugly, and you\u2019ll find better ways to joke around.", "All that hiding for a relationship that lasted 2 months? Bffr, yta", "NAH.
