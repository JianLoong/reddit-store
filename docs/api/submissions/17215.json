Sister certainly sounds like she's taking more after dear old dad.

Hopefully,you still have the texts and you can show him how it really was. \n\n It sounds to me like your sister was a little pissy about the concert or whatever else and decided to stir the pot.

Coming from the terrible home life you all did,it really would be best if the three of you were working together.
