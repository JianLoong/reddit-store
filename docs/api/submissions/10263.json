Not only do I have red hair, but I also have blue eyes, pale skin, freckles, you know, the whole genetic schindig. Anyways, recently I had a surgery, then ended up being fine in the end, however the moments before and after the operation is where this conflict occurs. \n\nIf you don't know, natural redheads require more anesthesia to be knocked out. And no, for all you healthcare workers who want to call me stupid and gaslight me, this is not something that I discovered on WebMd, or some facebook group. This is a proven fact with medical evidence from reliable scientific journals. \n\nSo I'm wheeled into the operating room and given the anesthesia via IV and the anesthesiologist, who was seemed cold to me from the start, asked me to count backwards from 100. I made it to something like 80, before he started asking me if I was trying to somehow fight the anesthesia. I said no, that it's just going to take longer for me. And here is where things got sour. He asked me what exactly I was doing to not be knocked out and I insisted that I wasn't doing anything. He continued to berate me and at one point said that the surgery would be taking place whether I fall asleep or not, so I better comply. I lost my shit at his accusations so here I said \"Are you fucking blind? I'm a ginger. Biologically I need more of that shit to fall asleep. How about you try that instead of berating me before I get cut open?\" He scoffed, but eventually did decide to give me more, and.....well what do you know? It worked. \n\nWhen I came to there was this nurse that was going in and out of my room, who kept glaring at me. I honestly didn't know what her issue was. Later, when she realized that I was more coherent, she decided to reprimand me as well. She called me \"disrespectful\" for speaking to the anesthesiologist in that way, and all he wanted for me was to have a good outcome for the surgery. She also told me that  I wasn't a healthcare worker so my hair color theory had no grounds in reality. I was livid and snapped at her saying that HE was the one being disrespectful for his baseless accusations and threat, and that she should go read a book about this in the medical journal, so that the next patient won't have to deal with not being believed. She kept quiet afterwards. \n\nSo I was alone for this surgery, but I did get my older sister to drive me home. When I explained to her about the shit that went down, she understood why I was angry at the anesthesiologist and the nurse, but that it didn't change the fact I was still disrespectful to two people who were trying to help me and take care of me, and that made me the asshole.

I consider that's just basic knowledge. I am not a health care worker nor a ginger, so I don't know if the scientific research on gingers requiring more anesthesia is widely known among health professionals. But I think that should not even matter in regards to anesthesia, because if for whatever reason the dosage doesn't work, the anesthesiologist should adjust the dosis to be sure the patient isn't awake while being operated on. I think that's very important for the safety for the patient and for the surgeon to be able to do his/her job properly.", "NTA, just because they are a healthcare worker doesn't mean you can't vouch for yourself.

On talking with them it transpired that they'd had issues at the dentist in the past having had dental treatments still in lots of pain after local was given.   Surgeon documented it well in her notes and also said they'd get it added to their online patient file (all healthcare places have access to here where I am) so that it would be known.  And told her to advocate for herself on the matter.  And reassured her that when she returned to get her other hands carpal tunnel sorted that they'd just *start* with three times the amount so she'd not need to go through all the tests and still feel the pain til they got it working.

(Re: inconvenience vs pain). \n\nLike I'm Trans and the one time I was in a lot of pain and had to be basically drowned in painkillers was when I had to be induced with Pitocin when I had my two kids. I was in a lot of pain (which is rare for me) and I asked for an epidural. Each time only one side of my body was numbed even after I got a large dose, and they made me turn on my side before giving me more. Then it still took a while for my other side to go numb. It sent the labor pain levels I was dealing with skyrocket because it was all condensed on my feeling side. I remember my nurses being weirded out that pretty much immediately after they removed the epidural stuff, cleaned me up, etc I was up and walking without any assistance. My nurse said she'd never seen someone gain mobility immediately after L&D with an epidural and that she'd never had a quieter L&D patient ever.\n\nHell even my recovery time surprised my gyno. I told him about how I had done the witch hazel + pads in the freezer thing and ended up not needing them because I didn't feel any pain or ache or anything.

I woke up when they were working on my bottom right molar. \n\nI couldn't feel pain necessarily but I could feel the grinding of tooth shards on bone while they were pulling them out. The sound was awful. I was too drugged to do anything other than cry and moan. Everyone freaked out when they realized I was awake.
