Not only do I have red hair, but I also have blue eyes, pale skin, freckles, you know, the whole genetic schindig. Anyways, recently I had a surgery, then ended up being fine in the end, however the moments before and after the operation is where this conflict occurs. \n\nIf you don't know, natural redheads require more anesthesia to be knocked out. And no, for all you healthcare workers who want to call me stupid and gaslight me, this is not something that I discovered on WebMd, or some facebook group. This is a proven fact with medical evidence from reliable scientific journals. \n\nSo I'm wheeled into the operating room and given the anesthesia via IV and the anesthesiologist, who was seemed cold to me from the start, asked me to count backwards from 100. I made it to something like 80, before he started asking me if I was trying to somehow fight the anesthesia. I said no, that it's just going to take longer for me. And here is where things got sour. He asked me what exactly I was doing to not be knocked out and I insisted that I wasn't doing anything. He continued to berate me and at one point said that the surgery would be taking place whether I fall asleep or not, so I better comply. I lost my shit at his accusations so here I said \"Are you fucking blind? I'm a ginger. Biologically I need more of that shit to fall asleep. How about you try that instead of berating me before I get cut open?\" He scoffed, but eventually did decide to give me more, and.....well what do you know? It worked. \n\nWhen I came to there was this nurse that was going in and out of my room, who kept glaring at me. I honestly didn't know what her issue was. Later, when she realized that I was more coherent, she decided to reprimand me as well. She called me \"disrespectful\" for speaking to the anesthesiologist in that way, and all he wanted for me was to have a good outcome for the surgery. She also told me that  I wasn't a healthcare worker so my hair color theory had no grounds in reality. I was livid and snapped at her saying that HE was the one being disrespectful for his baseless accusations and threat, and that she should go read a book about this in the medical journal, so that the next patient won't have to deal with not being believed. She kept quiet afterwards. \n\nSo I was alone for this surgery, but I did get my older sister to drive me home. When I explained to her about the shit that went down, she understood why I was angry at the anesthesiologist and the nurse, but that it didn't change the fact I was still disrespectful to two people who were trying to help me and take care of me, and that made me the asshole.

I consider that's just basic knowledge. I am not a health care worker nor a ginger, so I don't know if the scientific research on gingers requiring more anesthesia is widely known among health professionals. But I think that should not even matter in regards to anesthesia, because if for whatever reason the dosage doesn't work, the anesthesiologist should adjust the dosis to be sure the patient isn't awake while being operated on. I think that's very important for the safety for the patient and for the surgeon to be able to do his/her job properly.", "NTA, just because they are a healthcare worker doesn't mean you can't vouch for yourself.

On talking with them it transpired that they'd had issues at the dentist in the past having had dental treatments still in lots of pain after local was given.   Surgeon documented it well in her notes and also said they'd get it added to their online patient file (all healthcare places have access to here where I am) so that it would be known.  And told her to advocate for herself on the matter.  And reassured her that when she returned to get her other hands carpal tunnel sorted that they'd just *start* with three times the amount so she'd not need to go through all the tests and still feel the pain til they got it working.

I was so nervous that day that if any of them had been mean to me, I\u2019m sure I would have just embarrassingly burst into tears.

No numbing, no pain management at all. The kids were lined up, the one at the front is sat on a chair and told to open their mouth, doc goes in with either a knife or one of those heat knife things, slices the tonsils away and the kid is moved on. It was probably about 6 seconds total, clearly not a lot of care being taken. The doctor says something like \"it's so fast there's no pain\" or something, but I just remember the look of absolute shock on the kid as it happens, and immediately afterwards when he tries to swallow/feel his throat. Looked like he went into fucking shock, probably from the pain he was told he did not feel. Then he's yanked away and the next kid is sat down.

I was in the ICU for this so the next day asked my nurse if I could have another pain killer cause the pain was back. She told me to think of my baby and gave me a tylonel. It did nothing.

I even had one nurse tell me (during the initial consultation for the surgery) that redheads don't need more anaesthesia, we just have a higher tolerance for pain. WTH??? And btw, the next doctor's office knew exactly what I was talking about re: redheads.
