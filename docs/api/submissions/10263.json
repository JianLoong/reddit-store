Not only do I have red hair, but I also have blue eyes, pale skin, freckles, you know, the whole genetic schindig. Anyways, recently I had a surgery, then ended up being fine in the end, however the moments before and after the operation is where this conflict occurs. \n\nIf you don't know, natural redheads require more anesthesia to be knocked out. And no, for all you healthcare workers who want to call me stupid and gaslight me, this is not something that I discovered on WebMd, or some facebook group. This is a proven fact with medical evidence from reliable scientific journals. \n\nSo I'm wheeled into the operating room and given the anesthesia via IV and the anesthesiologist, who was seemed cold to me from the start, asked me to count backwards from 100. I made it to something like 80, before he started asking me if I was trying to somehow fight the anesthesia. I said no, that it's just going to take longer for me. And here is where things got sour. He asked me what exactly I was doing to not be knocked out and I insisted that I wasn't doing anything. He continued to berate me and at one point said that the surgery would be taking place whether I fall asleep or not, so I better comply. I lost my shit at his accusations so here I said \"Are you fucking blind? I'm a ginger. Biologically I need more of that shit to fall asleep. How about you try that instead of berating me before I get cut open?\" He scoffed, but eventually did decide to give me more, and.....well what do you know? It worked. \n\nWhen I came to there was this nurse that was going in and out of my room, who kept glaring at me. I honestly didn't know what her issue was. Later, when she realized that I was more coherent, she decided to reprimand me as well. She called me \"disrespectful\" for speaking to the anesthesiologist in that way, and all he wanted for me was to have a good outcome for the surgery. She also told me that  I wasn't a healthcare worker so my hair color theory had no grounds in reality. I was livid and snapped at her saying that HE was the one being disrespectful for his baseless accusations and threat, and that she should go read a book about this in the medical journal, so that the next patient won't have to deal with not being believed. She kept quiet afterwards. \n\nSo I was alone for this surgery, but I did get my older sister to drive me home. When I explained to her about the shit that went down, she understood why I was angry at the anesthesiologist and the nurse, but that it didn't change the fact I was still disrespectful to two people who were trying to help me and take care of me, and that made me the asshole.
