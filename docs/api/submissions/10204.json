I am happy to do this and normally get along great with Eva (we're both bookworms). She has ARFID, and eats a very limited number of things--it's not that she has things she won't eat, more that there is a specific list of things she \\*will\\* eat.\n\nFor the past two years I've been watching her, I've balanced Eva's needs with everyone else's by modifying meals, because I want her to be fed but at the same time I'm not restricting my family to the few dozen things Eva will eat. For instance, if I'm making broccoli beef and carrot stir fry, I'll cook the beef and carrots first, take out a serving for Eva, then add the sauce and broccoli for the rest of us. If I'm making mango chicken, I'll bake an extra chicken breast plain for Eva. If a meal can't be adapted at all, I make one of her safe foods.\n\nThis was going fine until a month ago. I baked a lasagna, and made extra meat sauce, so Eva got meat sauce on spaghetti and the rest of us had lasagna. But when I cut into the lasagna, Eva made a face and said it looked like a suppurating wound. I told her 'Nice vocabulary word, but you're not allowed to be rude about my cooking. You don't have to eat it, but you can't be nasty about it and spoil everyone's appetite.\" She looked unhappy but subsided. A week later, I made dal curry (she had frozen pizza) and she said it looked like diarrhea and smelled like ass, and I reiterated that being rude about my food at the table was unacceptable. This time I told my sister, who said she'd talk to her. Days later, I made chicken/broccoli/rice casserole (she had chicken and rice) and she compared it to cat vomit. I told her that if she couldn't be polite, she'd have to take her meal to the living room and eat it there. She went. I again told her mother.\n\nTwo days ago, I made Thai green curry for the rest of us and a sandwich and side salad for Eva. She took a look at the curry and opened her mouth. I cut her off and asked if she was capable of being civil at the table, and she sort of shook her head, so I handed her her sandwich and pointed her to the living room. She made a face, but went.\n\nLast night I got a call from my sister saying that I'm being cruel by banishing her daughter because she has a disability (ARFID). I said I wasn't banishing her because she had ARFID, I was banishing her because she was being insulting. My sister said that her daughter shouldn't have to fake it and that family shouldn't have to eat alone. I said all I was asking was for her to not say anything about our meal. My sister says I'm being insensitive to how hard it is for her to be surrounded by things she thinks are gross all the time, that I should be more accommodating, and that she's just a kid and I should be the mature one and not bully her.", "created_utc": 1676653908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114s1kg/aita_for_making_my_niece_eat_in_the_living_room/", "score": 513, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s an appropriate punishment for being rude to her host. She still gets to eat, but she doesn\u2019t get to do it while insulting everyone else\u2019s food. \n\nI do think this maybe an underlying issue - maybe she\u2019s jealous she doesn\u2019t get to eat your food so she\u2019s insulting it in a backwards attempt to prove she wouldn\u2019t want it anyway?", "NTA. You've set behavior boundaries that she keeps breaking.\n\nYou don't have to put up with her comments no matter what her mom says.  We teach people how to treat us.

Or is the mother just allowing her to continue unchecked with this? Therapy can be extremely helpful in minimizing the behaviour and making it easier for them to be around foods they don\u2019t like. It can also lead to recovery.", "NTA \n\nEva is insulting you, the person going to special effort to make her special food. Eva is 14. That's an age where learning to make food is relevant. I suggest Eva be responsible for her own meals at least 2x/week from here on out. Perhaps that will teach her appreciation for the efforts people are putting into her care.\n\nAs for your sister, she's wrong. There is a difference between being privately grossed out by something and insulting the food. Eva needs more therapy and treatment for her condition if she is physically incapable of not expressing insulting remarks about food others are eating.", "NTA, at 14 she's old enough to know better than insulting your cooking and making disgusting comments (I wouldn't be happy if someone described what I was about to eat as \"vomit\" and \"diarrhea\").", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to eat at the table she can keep her disgusting comments to herself", "NTA.

She needs to learn to manage her ARFID when around others without being rude to them and mum needs to encourage this rather than excuse her rudeness as ARFID related.", "NTA, but continue to have open communication with your niece about food. Continue to teach her that it's ok to nok like certain foods , but to be respectful about what others eat. I know she's not your child, but since she spends so much time with you i think it's important to help educate her.", "NTA.

Your sister needs to see how much work you already do to accommodate her daughter. Your niece is older enough to know how to behave.  Completely disrespectful", "NTA. At 14, she is old enough to have impulse control over what she says. You've made it clear what is acceptable at the dinner table. If your sister doesn't like this, then she can make alternate arrangements for her daughter. It sounds like you've made a really good effort to accomodate her daughter's ARFID.", "NTA- you arent expecting her to eat it, you are expecting her to be respectful of others. Having to leave the  table is a proportional and logical consequence. For extra impact you could have a conversation with her after dinner and explain why that isnt ok. Its ok to feel your feelings, but it is not ok to force those around you to feel your feelings. It may help her to not look at the food. Sometimes weird things like that may help her work on impuls control. Also before anyone says she should know, she may not, everyone is different. \n\nAs for your sister- when I babysit I am very clear with people: your children  are to abide by my rules, if they do not they will have the consequences that I see fit. If the parents don't like that they are free to find other arrangements.", "NTA.  14 is old enough to appreciate your efforts and have basic manners.  It\u2019s also old enough to stay alone and make her own food.\n\nShe either follows your rules in your house, or you refuse to host rude guests until she learns some manners.  This is a life skill she needs to pick up.", "NTA\nIf your niece is distressed by the scents and visuals of your family's food, then you are making accommodation for her needs by giving her a place to eat where she isn't subjected to distressing sensory input. If she hadn't been rude, then it wasn't an unreasonable option for addressing her special needs in this situation.\n\nHowever, it wasn't just an accommodation, because you had already made significant accommodations for her restricted diet. She was unnecessarily rude and insulting about the foods you'd prepared \u2013 which sound delicious, btw.\n\nNiece experienced the consequences of her actions. She should be taught how to speak in a way that isn't rude. Whatever her mother said to her obviously didn't convey the essential points. Your niece has a medical problem, but it's not the world's responsibility to adjust to her. She needs to learn how to handle situations like this, where she has sensory distress, such as asking for help to get through that moment of difficulty. \n\nTA here is not the niece, since she's a child who is still learning social skills. TA is her mother, who accused you of being a bully rather than helping her daughter learn how to express herself in a civil way, as well as to figure out a solution that makes reasonable accommodation without ostracizing the person who needs it. In addition, assuming that your sister isn't paying for your time and for all the food you provide to her daughter, you are doing your sister a favor by caring for your niece and making efforts to meet her nutritional needs.\n\nInstead of making disgusting comments about the food, niece should learn to say something like, \"Aunt, I am having an adverse physical response to the smell and looks of the food you made for the family. Help me.\" In this situation, eating in a separate room makes sense. In order to be included in the family gathering, perhaps a videocall connection like FaceTime or internal camera system could be used to allow her to participate without the odors of cooking. It would limit the visuals of the foods, too. Note: I am not an expert in ARFID, so maybe isolating oneself from other people's foods isn't the right way to manage the sensory distress. For some conditions, desensitization is a better strategy. Whatever is true for ARFID, the point is that the child learns by the consequences of her actions, and by the behaviors of the adults around her, how to communicate and navigate social situations with respect to her medical needs. Her mother failed. OP used reasonable consequences for niece's behavior.", "NTA. You are more than accommodating to her dietary needs, and if she cannot refrain from criticizing your food perhaps she should not come to your house. She is 14- old enough to be home alone.", "NTA. If you had forced her to eat your food or be banished to the living room, that would be what your sister is accusing you of. That she is being catered to because of her special need shows that you're acting to support her with her disability. Having a disability does not give a person the right to be rude to those who aren't. All you're asking for is that your niece be respectful and if she can't be, the rest of the family shouldn't be subjected to her rudeness. My daughter had several special needs, CP, learning disabilities, probably on the ASD spectrum. She was not allowed to be rude like this for things she couldn't do and was raised in such a way that she wasn't.\n\nYou were definitely the mature one out of all three of you.", "NTA. You are being very accommodating of her illness, but not tolerating her asshole behavior.", "NTA She's 14, not 4. And even 4 year olds are pretty easy to teach 'If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.'\n\nHaving said that, I feel for you sister. Our son had such an aversion to certain foods that watching OTHER people eat them would make him throw up. We spent a lot of meals in restaurants with him not being able to look at us while we ate. :P Luckily, he's not like that now.", "NTA. Keeping your mouth shut to refrain from being an unnecessary asshole to people is an important life skill.", "NTA. She does have a disability, however, everyone has to see other people eat things they think looks gross sometimes. It happens. It\u2019s incredibly rude to comment on it and especially to describe it as bodily waste. Eva is old enough to keep her comments to herself. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely a \u201cIf you can\u2019t say something nice, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d type scenario.", "nta. you are being super accommodating already by making her separate food.  this isn\u2019t even your kid. \nif your sis doesn\u2019t like it she can feed her herself. or at 14 Eva can make her own food.  why does she get to ruin the rest of yours meal bc she can\u2019t keep her mouth shut.", "NTA. She sounds exhausting. And she totally knows what she is doing so sis can piss off with that \"bullying\" nonsense. Does she expect you to change your family's meals to accommodate her ill-mannered daughter?  I would be rethinking the whole babysitting thing at this point.\n\nBTW, your meals sound great! Lasagna with extra meat sauce? Curry? Yes please!", "NTA Good grief. You couldn\u2019t possibly be more accommodating. Eva doesn\u2019t get to say everything she thinks. This sounds like new behavior for her - she\u2019s poking around to find where the boundaries are. She found them! Hold firm, Auntie.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are other children at the table who don't deserve to have their supper ruined.", "Because kicking a child out of the house to teach them a lesson, especially on the first offense of something pretty low stake, is incredibly unnecessary, emotionally harmful, and just seems like a weird power trip for the adult rather than a consequence that is relative to the \"crime\".", "This is so true\n\n*In fact I suppose the fact that we do have a good relationship might mean that she's more likely to lash out at me, because I'm a safe person to lash out at.*", "\"Eyes on your own plate, don't comment on what other people eat\" is exactly the right lesson to teach your children, and also exactly the lesson your niece also needs to learn.\n\nI assume your sister isn't going to be open to discussing this with you, but I wonder if you know who her therapist is? Obviously, her therapist can't tell you anything about her, but there's nothing stopping her therapist listening to you, or reading a letter from you. You presumably can't rely on your sister to explain it without her obvious bias coming into play, but it might be helpful for your niece's therapist to know how her behavior has changed recently.", "You really sound like you're doing an amazing job being a supportive family member to someone with ARFID. I hope at a later date your niece is able to recognize what a gift you've given her with your acceptance and accommodation and apologizes to you for this particular round of acting out. I wish I had some insight into her behavior for you, but in the absence of that I hope you know that you are the farthest thing from an asshole in this situation.", "Don't yuck other people's yums.", "it\u2019s not masking she\u2019s just being rude and using it as an excuse", "She is 14. She can cook her own damn food if she objects to your hard work. \n\n\nInsulting the person who spent time and effort over a meal is beyond rude. You have been more than patient. If she does it again, your sister needs to find alternative childcare arrangements (although there are 14 year olds that babysit kids by themselves,  why can't she stay at home by herself? Why does she have to spend time at your home after school?) because you should not have to tolerate such repeated rudeness in your own home.", "I would not do this the first time, but after the first time, no excuses. She doesn't want to behave like a civilized human, she can eat outside.\n\nWhat consequence is \"relative\" to the crime? She tossed repeated insults at someone who is doing her a favor. The only \"relative\" consequence here is not cooking for her at all - at least sending her outside means she isn't hungry."]}
