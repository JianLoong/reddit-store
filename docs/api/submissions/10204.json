I am happy to do this and normally get along great with Eva (we're both bookworms). She has ARFID, and eats a very limited number of things--it's not that she has things she won't eat, more that there is a specific list of things she \\*will\\* eat.\n\nFor the past two years I've been watching her, I've balanced Eva's needs with everyone else's by modifying meals, because I want her to be fed but at the same time I'm not restricting my family to the few dozen things Eva will eat. For instance, if I'm making broccoli beef and carrot stir fry, I'll cook the beef and carrots first, take out a serving for Eva, then add the sauce and broccoli for the rest of us. If I'm making mango chicken, I'll bake an extra chicken breast plain for Eva. If a meal can't be adapted at all, I make one of her safe foods.\n\nThis was going fine until a month ago. I baked a lasagna, and made extra meat sauce, so Eva got meat sauce on spaghetti and the rest of us had lasagna. But when I cut into the lasagna, Eva made a face and said it looked like a suppurating wound. I told her 'Nice vocabulary word, but you're not allowed to be rude about my cooking. You don't have to eat it, but you can't be nasty about it and spoil everyone's appetite.\" She looked unhappy but subsided. A week later, I made dal curry (she had frozen pizza) and she said it looked like diarrhea and smelled like ass, and I reiterated that being rude about my food at the table was unacceptable. This time I told my sister, who said she'd talk to her. Days later, I made chicken/broccoli/rice casserole (she had chicken and rice) and she compared it to cat vomit. I told her that if she couldn't be polite, she'd have to take her meal to the living room and eat it there. She went. I again told her mother.\n\nTwo days ago, I made Thai green curry for the rest of us and a sandwich and side salad for Eva. She took a look at the curry and opened her mouth. I cut her off and asked if she was capable of being civil at the table, and she sort of shook her head, so I handed her her sandwich and pointed her to the living room. She made a face, but went.\n\nLast night I got a call from my sister saying that I'm being cruel by banishing her daughter because she has a disability (ARFID). I said I wasn't banishing her because she had ARFID, I was banishing her because she was being insulting. My sister said that her daughter shouldn't have to fake it and that family shouldn't have to eat alone. I said all I was asking was for her to not say anything about our meal. My sister says I'm being insensitive to how hard it is for her to be surrounded by things she thinks are gross all the time, that I should be more accommodating, and that she's just a kid and I should be the mature one and not bully her.", "created_utc": 1676653908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114s1kg/aita_for_making_my_niece_eat_in_the_living_room/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s an appropriate punishment for being rude to her host. She still gets to eat, but she doesn\u2019t get to do it while insulting everyone else\u2019s food. \n\nI do think this maybe an underlying issue - maybe she\u2019s jealous she doesn\u2019t get to eat your food so she\u2019s insulting it in a backwards attempt to prove she wouldn\u2019t want it anyway?", "NTA. You've set behavior boundaries that she keeps breaking.\n\nYou don't have to put up with her comments no matter what her mom says.  We teach people how to treat us.

Or is the mother just allowing her to continue unchecked with this? Therapy can be extremely helpful in minimizing the behaviour and making it easier for them to be around foods they don\u2019t like.

I suggest Eva be responsible for her own meals at least 2x/week from here on out. Perhaps that will teach her appreciation for the efforts people are putting into her care.\n\nAs for your sister, she's wrong. There is a difference between being privately grossed out by something and insulting the food. Eva needs more therapy and treatment for her condition if she is physically incapable of not expressing insulting remarks about food others are eating.", "NTA, at 14 she's old enough to know better than insulting your cooking and making disgusting comments (I wouldn't be happy if someone described what I was about to eat as \"vomit\" and \"diarrhea\").", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to eat at the table she can keep her disgusting comments to herself", "NTA.

She needs to learn to manage her ARFID when around others without being rude to them and mum needs to encourage this rather than excuse her rudeness as ARFID related.", "NTA, but continue to have open communication with your niece about food. Continue to teach her that it's ok to nok like certain foods , but to be respectful about what others eat. I know she's not your child, but since she spends so much time with you i think it's important to help educate her.", "NTA.

Your sister needs to see how much work you already do to accommodate her daughter. Your niece is older enough to know how to behave.  Completely disrespectful", "NTA. At 14, she is old enough to have impulse control over what she says. You've made it clear what is acceptable at the dinner table. If your sister doesn't like this, then she can make alternate arrangements for her daughter. It sounds like you've made a really good effort to accomodate her daughter's ARFID.", "NTA- you arent expecting her to eat it, you are expecting her to be respectful of others. Having to leave the  table is a proportional and logical consequence. For extra impact you could have a conversation with her after dinner and explain why that isnt ok. Its ok to feel your feelings, but it is not ok to force those around you to feel your feelings. It may help her to not look at the food. Sometimes weird things like that may help her work on impuls control. Also before anyone says she should know, she may not, everyone is different. \n\nAs for your sister- when I babysit I am very clear with people: your children  are to abide by my rules, if they do not they will have the consequences that I see fit. If the parents don't like that they are free to find other arrangements.", "NTA.  14 is old enough to appreciate your efforts and have basic manners.  It\u2019s also old enough to stay alone and make her own food.\n\nShe either follows your rules in your house, or you refuse to host rude guests until she learns some manners.  This is a life skill she needs to pick up.", "NTA\nIf your niece is distressed by the scents and visuals of your family's food, then you are making accommodation for her needs by giving her a place to eat where she isn't subjected to distressing sensory input. If she hadn't been rude, then it wasn't an unreasonable option for addressing her special needs in this situation.\n\nHowever, it wasn't just an accommodation, because you had already made significant accommodations for her restricted diet. She was unnecessarily rude and insulting about the foods you'd prepared \u2013 which sound delicious, btw.\n\nNiece experienced the consequences of her actions. She should be taught how to speak in a way that isn't rude. Whatever her mother said to her obviously didn't convey the essential points. Your niece has a medical problem, but it's not the world's responsibility to adjust to her. She needs to learn how to handle situations like this, where she has sensory distress, such as asking for help to get through that moment of difficulty. \n\nTA here is not the niece, since she's a child who is still learning social skills. TA is her mother, who accused you of being a bully rather than helping her daughter learn how to express herself in a civil way, as well as to figure out a solution that makes reasonable accommodation without ostracizing the person who needs it. In addition, assuming that your sister isn't paying for your time and for all the food you provide to her daughter, you are doing your sister a favor by caring for your niece and making efforts to meet her nutritional needs.\n\nInstead of making disgusting comments about the food, niece should learn to say something like, \"Aunt, I am having an adverse physical response to the smell and looks of the food you made for the family. Help me.\" In this situation, eating in a separate room makes sense. In order to be included in the family gathering, perhaps a videocall connection like FaceTime or internal camera system could be used to allow her to participate without the odors of cooking. It would limit the visuals of the foods, too. Note: I am not an expert in ARFID, so maybe isolating oneself from other people's foods isn't the right way to manage the sensory distress. For some conditions, desensitization is a better strategy. Whatever is true for ARFID, the point is that the child learns by the consequences of her actions, and by the behaviors of the adults around her, how to communicate and navigate social situations with respect to her medical needs. Her mother failed. OP used reasonable consequences for niece's behavior.", "NTA. You are more than accommodating to her dietary needs, and if she cannot refrain from criticizing your food perhaps she should not come to your house. She is 14- old enough to be home alone.", "NTA. If you had forced her to eat your food or be banished to the living room, that would be what your sister is accusing you of. That she is being catered to because of her special need shows that you're acting to support her with her disability. Having a disability does not give a person the right to be rude to those who aren't. All you're asking for is that your niece be respectful and if she can't be, the rest of the family shouldn't be subjected to her rudeness. My daughter had several special needs, CP, learning disabilities, probably on the ASD spectrum. She was not allowed to be rude like this for things she couldn't do and was raised in such a way that she wasn't.\n\nYou were definitely the mature one out of all three of you.", "NTA. You are being very accommodating of her illness, but not tolerating her asshole behavior.", "NTA She's 14, not 4. And even 4 year olds are pretty easy to teach 'If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.'\n\nHaving said that, I feel for you sister. Our son had such an aversion to certain foods that watching OTHER people eat them would make him throw up. We spent a lot of meals in restaurants with him not being able to look at us while we ate. :P Luckily, he's not like that now.", "NTA. Keeping your mouth shut to refrain from being an unnecessary asshole to people is an important life skill.", "NTA. She does have a disability, however, everyone has to see other people eat things they think looks gross sometimes. It happens. It\u2019s incredibly rude to comment on it and especially to describe it as bodily waste. Eva is old enough to keep her comments to herself. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely a \u201cIf you can\u2019t say something nice, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d type scenario.", "nta. you are being super accommodating already by making her separate food.  this isn\u2019t even your kid. \nif your sis doesn\u2019t like it she can feed her herself. or at 14 Eva can make her own food.  why does she get to ruin the rest of yours meal bc she can\u2019t keep her mouth shut.", "NTA. She sounds exhausting. And she totally knows what she is doing so sis can piss off with that \"bullying\" nonsense. Does she expect you to change your family's meals to accommodate her ill-mannered daughter?  I would be rethinking the whole babysitting thing at this point.\n\nBTW, your meals sound great! Lasagna with extra meat sauce? Curry? Yes please!", "NTA Good grief. You couldn\u2019t possibly be more accommodating. Eva doesn\u2019t get to say everything she thinks.

As to whether she's eating enough, she is eating what looks to me like a normal teenage girl's amount of food at dinner (I don't make her breakfasts or lunches, or meals on the weekends), and she is absolutely allowed to make herself a peanut butter sandwich or some ramen if she's hungry outside mealtimes.\n\nI can't rule out some other form of disordered eating, but given that my sister is firmly of the opinion that this is my problem and not niece's (she's VERY protective of her daughter), I'm not sure how I'd pursue that.", "I know she's in weekly therapy, but I don't know precisely what they talk about.", "There could be something else going on that you aren\u2019t aware of \u2014 maybe even your sister isn\u2019t aware of it. Something at school, perhaps? 14 is a tumultuous age. \n\nRegardless, I think you\u2019re doing right by her and your sister by even taking her in every single day. I hope you guys sort this out soon.", "Hey OP, I have ARFID. Here\u2019s my thoughts.\n\nI remember being bullied and pressured and pushed around a lot by adults and peers for how and what I ate when I was a kid.\n\nIs it possible she\u2019s facing similar pressure at school or elsewhere, and is taking it out on you (\u201cif it\u2019s okay for people to make mean comments about my food, I should be allowed to tell people exactly what I think of theirs\u201d may be the mindset she\u2019s operating under.) \n\nIt could be any number of things, but this is the first thing that came to mind for me.", " Its ok to feel your feelings, but it is not ok to force those around you to feel your feelings. It may help her to not look at the food", ">ARFID can affect a child\u2019s health, mood, behavior and energy level. As children get older, ARFID can also impact their social life. It gets harder to do fun things like attend parties, go to camp or have a sleepover.\n\nhttps://www.childrens.com/specialties-services/conditions/avoidant-restrictive-food-intake-disorder#:~:text=ARFID%20can%20affect%20a%20child%27s,camp%20or%20have%20a%20sleepover\n\nAFRID can come with increasing social isolation. OP and the mom are the adults in this situation and should be doing things to combat that. Yes, Eva is being rude. But there should still be attention to her social and emotional wellbeing. If OP is ignoring that, it's pretty shitty behavior as an adult in Eva's life.", "NTA. You sound like a kind and supportive aunt. I actually lol'ed that you complimented the vocab choice before laying down the boundary. \n\nI have a niece with ARFID and my sister taught her at a young age to say \"it's not my favorite\" about something and that's basically the only insult allowed. You're trying to accommodate her (successfully, it sounds like) and she's old enough to understand what rude behavior is. I wonder if it would help her to understand that insulting food in those terms would put everyone off their meal? Maybe she can dig in to some empathy there. Fingers crossed this is a snarky phase. You're doing great.", "> if she was capable of being civil at the table, and she sort of shook her head\n\nI find this bit alarming. You asked if she was ABLE to be civil, and she said no. As in she's experiencing some degree of internal pressure or compulsion to say these things. That's what suggested to me there might be more than just teenager-y behavior here.\n\nI think you should be talking with Eva and her mom more about what's changed and what work arounds might be reasonable.", "Might be worth asking her.  IS there a reason she can't be polite at the table?  If there is, fine deal with that.  If there isn't, then she needs to learn how to be polite.", "Agreed, and maybe I typed it wrong.\n\nIf she has Tourette's, then she can't really help it.  But, that should be diagnosed, and not assumed. I just think there's a chance that someone who already has some challenges, and is repeatedly saying something rude, MIGHT also have some underlying issues that are worth checking with a professional.\n\nIf it's not Tourette's, then niece is just being a rude 14yr old, and needs to learn there are consequences for rudeness.", "That's totally fair. I am, admittedly, talking from my own experience of an ED and how nasty it made my moods - almost like I was someone else entirely. It can also make you quite deceptive but that's because your brain literally starts to wire differently without adequate nutrition. If she's still approaching food healthily (portions wise) that's good at least.\n\nIf your sister pushes back I'd just reiterate that your space should be respected and you're already very accomodating of your niece, and if sis would put up with similar mean and gross commentary on her own meals. You've even approached it with \"please be civil or leave\" rather than just \"go eat somewhere else\". But you're doing the right thing.\n\nThe one and only thing I'd watch out for is possible hiding of food if niece is asked to eat alone. Then you have a very big red flag. \n\nNTA for judgement bot purposes.", "It's possible. I've tried to gently talk to her about it, but she very VERY clearly doesn't want to talk to me about it, so I haven't pushed because I don't want her to stop talking to me entirely (we have a good relationship other than this and have bonded over shared taste in books and so on, and I want to remain a person she feels safe talking to). But it's entirely possible that some other people in her life are giving her a hard time. In fact I suppose the fact that we \\*do\\* have a good relationship might mean that she's more likely to lash out at me, because I'm a safe person to lash out at.\n\nMy husband and I, and my son (who is 17), have always made a concerted effort to not comment on her food choices because of her struggles. My daughter is 9 and doesn't fully understand the situation, but she learned \"eyes on your own plate, don't comment on what other people eat\" years ago even so. But I have no idea what's happening with Eva e.g. at school.\n\nThis might be an angle I can raise with my sister, actually, so thank you.", "exactly this! i was bullied so much for having \u201cweird\u201d food choices. and i know growing up (even now) i made tons of comments like this about food. mainly because i just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the fact people could eat the food i was terrified of. being able to talk through those thoughts and fears is what allowed me to see the irrationality of it.", "Don't yuck someone else's yum.", "What would you suggest? That's a genuine question, not a snarky one. Eva very, very clearly doesn't want to talk about it--after saying that she's tired of faking it, she changes the subject, and I don't want to alienate her further by pushing too hard. We get along well outside the very recent dinner table issue, and I'm concerned that if I keep redirecting her to a topic she doesn't want to discuss, she'll stop talking to me altogether. My sister clearly thinks the issue is that I'm ableist, and as such isn't willing to listen to what I have to say. I am in no kind of parental/guardian role legally, so I can't do anything about her medical care.\n\nI suppose I could look up the \"Doctor Smith\"s in my area and see if I can figure out which one is her therapist and call to let them know about the issue? My sister would be furious if she found out I did that, but possibly she wouldn't know. But otherwise, besides 'feed her food she can eat, set a boundary, and be there for her as much as possible in general' I'm literally at a loss.\n\nIf you have concrete suggestions, please, I am all ears. I love this kid. I am just at a loss.", "just because she has this thing doesn't mean she can't be nice and kind. she needs to learn to be respectful of others. if she does this elsewhere, she won't have friends and won't be well liked. no food disorder allows for rudeness", "She just says she's tired of holding back her opinions and faking it/masking. I honestly can't tell if it's an impulse control disorder or a teenager being a teenager, and I feel limited in what I can do beyond asking and setting boundaries given that I'm not her parent/guardian.", "I think its because her mom is letting her get away wit it\n\nBut one days she's gonna run her mouth at the wrong person, her boss, clients, etc", "Can you talk with your sister and ask for a family session with the therapist? Can Eva eat first then join you guys at the table to socialize after, or reverse order? Can she basically come and go as she pleases from the dinner table to go in a private area, voice her thoughts, and then come back once the urge passes?", "NTA but since she is over so much it might be worth a phone call with the therapist to find out the best way to deal with this behavior.   Ask you sister if you can speak with the therapist and see if everyone can agree on expectations.", "It did occur to me that at my workplace, saying that Indian food smells like ass would get you a stern talking-to and remedial sensitivity training from HR.", "I'll try asking my sister. I'm fairly sure that if I framed it as if I thought that my niece had an issue, she'd say no (she is very protective of my niece), but if I frame it as me thinking I might be the problem, she might say yes, maybe.\n\nShe's welcome to leave the table at any time, and that's always been clear. I've never been a \"you sit at the table until you're done\" person. I'd be happy to let her go cool off and come back when she feels like she can stop comparing the things that my husband and other children are eating to bodily effluvia, I just am not willing to make them listen to it while they're attempting to eat themselves. Everyone deserves a peaceful meal, both my niece and my children/husband/me.", "Yeah, my tourette's has DEFINITELY caused problems (I laugh at every thing I say), but at least I have a diagnoses", "> I'd be happy to let her go cool off and come back when she feels like she can stop comparing the things that my husband and other children are eating to bodily effluvia\n\nThen tell her that explicitly. A 14yo isn't necessarily going to think of the solution on their own.", "You can ask for one by framing it to your sister as trying to involve the therapist to help you come up with less harmful ways of communicating with her daughter and keep her involved to everyone's benefit.\n\nNote, I don't think you're being harmful, but that might work to convince your sister.", "I will do so, thank you. Hopefully this is a compromise that both she and my sister can live with."]}
