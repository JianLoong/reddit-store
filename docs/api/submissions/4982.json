You'll need to stand up for yourself and let them know you can make up you're open mind about what is right. And demanding that someone else doesn't have the same dress as you, is not right lol. \n\nPeople like that act like victims which triggers the will to help in others.

First with your fianc\u00e9 to discuss the comment, your feelings on being deprioritized because there\u2019s clearly a ranking of DILs and how best to approach a conversation with your MIL. \n\nTalk with Christine, share that unfortunately you\u2019ve already chosen your dress. You are making alterations so that it is more unique to you but isn\u2019t it kind of a cool thing that y\u2019all can share with people down the line? How two women marrying a set of brothers had the same wedding dress? That this coincidence let y\u2019all bond and share something even though you each made it uniquely their own? \n\nThere are proactive and positive ways to approach this, IF they are willing. Otherwise it\u2019ll be a fight. But it\u2019s too late to change your dress now and Christine has plenty of time to decide how important this is to her.", "NTA. You and your guy have a fabulous wedding. And congratulations!", "NTA.\n\nWhy the hell do women do this?  Why do some women honestly believe this day is anything more than an overpriced party that isn't actually celebrating what they think it is?
