Even if you weren\u2019t getting it customized, no one is going to be comparing a dress she wears a year from now to one you wear 3mos from now. That\u2019s because, sorry, no one is going to remember what dress you wore - and shortly after her wedding happens, no one is going to remember it, either. (This is assuming the dress is not designed to be memorable. I mean, it\u2019s not made of balloons or with transparent panels designed to show off your lingerie, or something like that, right? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a normal wedding gown.)\n\nHell, if she really loves that dress, it would make more sense for her to ask if you\u2019d mind if she wore it, too. (Assuming you are both of a similar size.) She could offer to split the cost of the actual dress with the understanding that you\u2019d each pay for your own alterations. In fact, you might try suggesting it. \n\nI\u2019ve no idea where my wedding dress is today. I wasn\u2019t going to be wearing it again, anyway, so after my wedding I gave it to a niece who was planning her wedding. (I\u2019m youngest in a very blended family. Most of a my 2 eldest brother\u2019s children are older than I am.) I know she wore it. Her sister did, also, and then it went to one of my other brother\u2019s daughters. In total, I think at least 6 women in my family wore it over the years and where it is now I couldn\u2019t say. But, I can say I never missed it. I know everyone thinks they\u2019ll keep it for the memories, but I can almost guarantee that it\u2019ll go into a bag or box and stuffed into the back of your closet. It\u2019ll get hauled around from house to house taking up room because you\u2019ll feel guilty about getting rid of it. But, you\u2019re likely to be far too busy making new memories than hassling with pulling it out of storage to re-live old ones. That\u2019s why you have pictures. Keep some pieces from the alterations and stick them in your wedding album if you want a physical reminder of the fabric. Start a new family tradition and let her deal with the storage until someone else needs it.\n\nBut, whether you share it, or she buys her own, the fact remains that you chose, and purchased, a dress. She has not purchased a dress. And, no matter what she says now about having chosen it, there is no guarantee that when she finally gets around to purchasing one that this is the one she is going to buy. So, she can go pound sand. So can your soon-to-be MIL. And, you need to have some serious conversations with your fianc\u00e9 about *her* involvement, because if this is how she is going to treat you, I do not see good things on the horizon.", "NTA.  You bought your dress first.  Your wedding is first.  You had absolutely zero ability to read Christine's mind.  She needs to figure it out.  Your future MIL is delusional.", "NTA. No one besides the bride will remember what her dress looks like, 10 minutes after they leave the reception. Besides, you got yours picked out first. You snooze, you lose!", "\"Picked out\" vs. \"going to pick\" - your dress choice is a done deal. She can get over herself. NTA", "NTA, she wants the dress you picked out, and she's immature and thinks it would make her look bad to wear the same dress as you. Ignore her", "100% on the money!", "My money is on no, her wedding is still a year away so she could have tried it, but from the \"she was going to pick that one\" it sounds like if she has tried on dresses at all, she's been on the fence about the one she wanted until OP showed her hers.  I think most likely Christine has been scanning wedding dresses and had a few earmarked that she liked including OPs.  With her wedding in December next year, she likely is going to start looking for a dress soonish.  And I totally agree, she could absolutely change her mind.  Just because you like a dress doesn't mean you will actually like it once you see it in person or once you have it on.  NTA.", ">She said y out should do it because Christine\u2019s \u201cbeen in the family longer.\u201d THAT needs a conversation\n\nDoes it? It's clear where she stands so just act accordingly.

Op NTA", "I agree.. seems to me like it\u2019s a competition to FSIL. Now the whole family is against you because you found the dress you wanted & somehow it\u2019s the same one she obviously didn\u2019t buy when she supposedly wanted it so bad? Yeah right. Stand your ground OP.", "Mariah Carey? lol", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault that the brother took seven years to propose!", "She did. They got engaged only 3 months before us", "I was surprised that any bridal shop would take returns. So I had to look at David\u2019s.

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re marrying into an AH family, though.", "wait.. i missed the part where you ruined their wedding. If you hadn't shown her your dress she wouldn't have even known and also, you already bought it and she \" was going to pick\", why can't she just choose another one if this was such a big issue for her, obviously you didn't mind if it was similar. NTA", "NTA your sister in law and MIL are though. And this all sounds a little fishy on SIL\u2019s part. Out of millions of dresses she just happened to choose yours? I think she just loved your dress.\n\nBTW, if you and your husband decide to have children, DO NOT under any circumstances share your baby names with anyone. She will find out and try and claim them.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t aware that she had picked the same dress and you didn\u2019t pick it for that reason. She could also return her dress and get a new one. I don\u2019t see her offering that option.", "NTA \n\nYour soon to be ex's family has already let you know where you stand, and they've sided with crazy, entitled bridezilla when you barely have two months to find, order, and alter a replacement.  You are in for a bumpy marriage.", "NTA Make note that your BF thinks Christine is worth more to his family and has a higher standing in the hierarchy. The fact there is a hierarchy is worrying by itself.", "INFO: Did you fianc\u00e9 tell his family and friends he was going to propose to you before he did it? Like maybe three or four months before doing it?", "NTA, also --  no one in attendance at both weddings will notice the base dress is the same.", "Moral of the story\u2026 don\u2019t show anyone your dress besides who shops with you\u2026\nNTA, she saw it and wanted it\u2026 no way she magically found the same dress, or she would have said \u201cthat\u2019s my same dress\u201d immediately!", "NTA. I \ud83d\udcaf guarantee you that it only became \u201cher dress\u201d after you showed it to her.", "NTA, this isn't something she gets to ask. Yours is chosen, she needs to adjust.", "NTA they expect you to find, fit and alter another dress in 2mo?!?   Easier solution Christine can find another dress, not like she actually brought one", "NTA  Wear your dress.   Who know, maybe their wedding may not even happen.", "NTA - but I have NC with my MIL, and I want you to have a good relationship with your future MIL. What will your decision (however you decide) mean for your relationship with her?", "Nta", "hell no NTa", "NTA - you chose first and she didn't even buy hers yet!\n\nWhat kind of entitled ridiculous bridezilla nonsense is this?! Tell your mother she is welcome to go help that woman find a new dress, but yours isn't going anywhere.\n\nPlus 99% of brides dresses seem to be NON-REFUNDABLE. No exchanges, no refunds (from what I have seen) and 'all sales are final'.\n\nHow are you supposedly ruining HER wedding when you chose your gown first, she hasn't bought one or showed anyone one she liked, and your wedding is well before hers? \"She has been in this family longer\" Yah well that means she had WAY more time to decide on her dress and buy it. End of discussion!\n\nAnd make note that his mom is treating you this way. No special treatment for her since she wants to play favorites. She owes you a HUGE apology and until you get one, her involvement in anything in your life should be bare minimum at best.", "I would have told her that you're flattered she wants to copy your dress. NTA. If anyone comes after you, just repeat that you're more than fine with her wanting to buy the same dress and you're really flattered she likes your tastes.", "Same dress?  Similar dress?  So what?  None of the guests care.", "It was the dress she was GOING to pick? As in, no money had been spent and nothing lost nor gained?

Hoping everything works out well for you!", "LOL NTA\n\nBrides who do this crack me up.\n\nLiterally no one remembers specific wedding dresses and they honestly all look the same.

Nta", "Ad it was a dress that C was GOING to choose?  Says who?  Sounds sus to me. Like she just wanted a reason to be a bridezilla early on- and maybe \"prove\" that she was going to have MIL on her side, to some weird power move.  So weird.", "What?!? Thats *way* too reasonable!", "or, just hear me out for a second here, they could both wear the same dress because who the hell cares?", "Exactly. Why didn't Christine ever say anything when OP showed her the dress?", "And the nerve of future MIL. \"Christina's been in the family longer?\" Like they're in competition with each other. WTF? No one is married yet so by the definition of FAMILY OP will be in the family longer as she's getting married first.", "Seriously tho, how many people with their own lives, are going to remember that OP wore similar dress a year ago?", "Exactly. Once you *know* you want a dress, you order it! SIL is being an A H and MIL is backing her. I feel really sorry for OP.", "My money\u2019s on she tentatively picked it out based on how good OP looked in it.", "For real, she needs to have her mom or best friend hide that thing in a closet at their house", "Absolutely NOBODY remembers wedding dresses in detail unless it's their own.", "I think this- getting Mil to take sides, showing that she has power in this family, might have been the point.  GROSS.", "Then it was a huge A H move for her to try and steal *your* dress. If she hadn\u2019t already ordered it, then she hadn\u2019t chosen it. She\u2019s being an A H 100%.", "NTA,  you bought the damn dress. Your wedding is in Feb.\n\nChristine wedding is in 9 months and she can wear the same dress or find another.  \n\nSeems like this is Christine problem,  not yours.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that she has been in the family longer, only means then that logic can be used against them.\n\n\"Well the dress has been with me longer, so it needs to stay with me.\"\n\nMaybe that's me being petty though.", "Nta and I have to ask.. Who was engaged first?", "NTA. Don\u2019t change your dress. Whoever doesn\u2019t like that can eff off.", "NTA\n\nThe entitlement I keep seeing these days\u2026. Dear goodness!", "There was a post a while back where a girl and her sister in law (or sister or friend it\u2019s been a while) picked out the exact same dress. They freaked at first but then realized they were going to accessorize the dress completely  differently and helped each other with making their respective dress look unique.\n\nChristine could learn a lot from them.\nShe needs to calm down and realize that unless you are getting a one of a kind dress made for you, someone out there will have the exact same dress as you. She needs to get over it.\n\nNTA OP", "NTA. Even if she had also committed to the dress and didn't have time to change it, or if she had bought it last week, you still are not obligated to return your dress. Also, no one except the two of you will care if you wear the same one. Unless you intend to wear it at her wedding, it shouldn't really matter.\n\nIf I was her, I'd find out how you felt about me still buying the dress and I'd suggest a cute matchy photoshoot together. \n\nBright side: your fiance is standing up to their family for you, so I see good things for your marriage. \n\nAlso, about everyone talking about the comment from your MIL that the other girl has been in the family longer... yeah, have a conversation, but don't walk in assuming the worst. She may just be legitimately trying to find the best way out of a sticky situation, and just not doing a very good job. Plus, it sounds like she's really only heard one side of the story so far, and that version may not have been fully accurate.", "NTA  She's mad that you are getting married before her.", "Is FSIL jealous you're getting married before her? She's been in the relationship for 7 years and known the family for longer than you have so it sounds more like jealousy than the wedding dress.\nMaybe she thinks she won't be the top DIL because she will be married after you (2nd place)", "NTA Why is it you who has to change the dress when you\u2019ve already purchased it?", "NTA. People that say stuff like a dress will \"ruin their wedding\" aren't getting married for the right reasons. Lol. Wear your dress and congrats!", "NTA omg. You bought it! She was just considering! Wear your dream dress with pride at your wedding :)", "she \"was going\" to pick it? yeah - right!\n\n&#x200B;\n\ndon't change!", "NTA. If you were gonna pick it, then you probably should have picked it.  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA and can guy even return a wedding dress? I don't think you can.", "NTA. Even most brides can't describe their own wedding dress accurately after a while. And there are many months between the two weddings. And the family will remember the unpleasantness around the wedding a lot more clearly than they will remember the dress/es.", "NTA. You had no ill will. Like you said, you had no idea what Christine was thinking for her wedding. Kudos to your fiance for sticking up for you. Anybody asking you to reconsider the dress you chose is an AH.", "I'd ask her the name/cut/style of the dress and where she saw it then say \"because surely it can't be the same the name of my dress was (insert some random name)\" \nI can guarantee that even if you say a fake name of the dress she will say \"yes that's the one\" or something similar. \n\nShe saw your dress and loved it and now doesn't want you to have it because she wants it. \n\nOn the off chance she actually did choose the same dress, who cares. If she doesn't like the fact you'll be wearing the same dress then she can change her choice.", "NTA but you have a future MIL problem. You will always be playing second fiddle and NEVER be equal to Christine in her eyes, because she's been around longer. You need to consider your future relationship with your in laws.", "NTA. A dress is a dress\u2026if you both like it and it suits you both, then both of you buy it.\n\nTo everyone watching it\u2019s just a pretty white dress, and after 9 months no-one will care other than the brides and perhaps their mothers\u2026and since you\u2019ll be wearing it second and you don\u2019t care about it looking similar then don\u2019t worry about it.", "_And_ put a password on the wedding dress store account.\n\nJust in cases FSIL decides on your behalf.", "Yes! Do exactly that, only of course whatever you do DON'T TELL THE REAL NAME UNTIL YOUR BABY IS BORN. Maybe not until the baptism.", "However, it would be wise of OP to suss out in advance where pettiness can flower, and side step it.  Make sure no wedding day food or drink can make a huge mess of the dress if it happens to explode all over it; protect all passwords; beforehand keep the dress at the store or wherever so no stray visitor can just happen to damage it ...", "Ohhh yes on the name thing. Also anything else - decor you\u2019re thinking about for your home, vacation spots, etc", "Sounds to me like OP's story is that there IS no dress debacle.", "She was but we were engaged only 3 months after.", "I mean yes it does. I'm guessing hubby wants to keep in contact with his mom, and OP isn't ready to give up hope on MIL, so hashing out something point blank may force her to evaluate that comparison method. If not, at least OP tried, rather than simmer.", "What does pfp mean?", "Lmao", "It shouldn't be at the house, period. Keep it at the shop or rent a storage unit with a lock only OP has the combination to", "I have never based by clothing choices on what other people think.  Who cares if they have something similar or were planning something similar?  What difference does it make?  It only matters that you like what you are wearing.  I don't understand why people make such a big deal about such a trivial thing.", "I just want to say kudos to your fiance for defending you. Not all guys would say anything to their brother.

They won\u2019t look 100% alike.\n\n4) while I understand there are certain people who want a certain look, there are *thousands* of styles and dresses to choose from.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t get special treatment because she\u2019s been in the family \u201clonger,\u201d and if she has an issue with matching dresses then she can change hers.
