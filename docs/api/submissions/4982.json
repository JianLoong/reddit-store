Even if you weren\u2019t getting it customized, no one is going to be comparing a dress she wears a year from now to one you wear 3mos from now. That\u2019s because, sorry, no one is going to remember what dress you wore - and shortly after her wedding happens, no one is going to remember it, either. (This is assuming the dress is not designed to be memorable. I mean, it\u2019s not made of balloons or with transparent panels designed to show off your lingerie, or something like that, right? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a normal wedding gown.)\n\nHell, if she really loves that dress, it would make more sense for her to ask if you\u2019d mind if she wore it, too. (Assuming you are both of a similar size.) She could offer to split the cost of the actual dress with the understanding that you\u2019d each pay for your own alterations. In fact, you might try suggesting it. \n\nI\u2019ve no idea where my wedding dress is today. I wasn\u2019t going to be wearing it again, anyway, so after my wedding I gave it to a niece who was planning her wedding. (I\u2019m youngest in a very blended family. Most of a my 2 eldest brother\u2019s children are older than I am.) I know she wore it. Her sister did, also, and then it went to one of my other brother\u2019s daughters. In total, I think at least 6 women in my family wore it over the years and where it is now I couldn\u2019t say. But, I can say I never missed it. I know everyone thinks they\u2019ll keep it for the memories, but I can almost guarantee that it\u2019ll go into a bag or box and stuffed into the back of your closet. It\u2019ll get hauled around from house to house taking up room because you\u2019ll feel guilty about getting rid of it. But, you\u2019re likely to be far too busy making new memories than hassling with pulling it out of storage to re-live old ones. That\u2019s why you have pictures. Keep some pieces from the alterations and stick them in your wedding album if you want a physical reminder of the fabric. Start a new family tradition and let her deal with the storage until someone else needs it.\n\nBut, whether you share it, or she buys her own, the fact remains that you chose, and purchased, a dress. She has not purchased a dress. And, no matter what she says now about having chosen it, there is no guarantee that when she finally gets around to purchasing one that this is the one she is going to buy. So, she can go pound sand. So can your soon-to-be MIL. And, you need to have some serious conversations with your fianc\u00e9 about *her* involvement, because if this is how she is going to treat you, I do not see good things on the horizon.", "NTA.  You bought your dress first.  Your wedding is first.  You had absolutely zero ability to read Christine's mind.  She needs to figure it out.  Your future MIL is delusional.", "NTA. No one besides the bride will remember what her dress looks like, 10 minutes after they leave the reception. Besides, you got yours picked out first. You snooze, you lose!", "\"Picked out\" vs. \"going to pick\" - your dress choice is a done deal. She can get over herself. NTA", "NTA, she wants the dress you picked out, and she's immature and thinks it would make her look bad to wear the same dress as you. Ignore her", "100% on the money!", "My money is on no, her wedding is still a year away so she could have tried it, but from the \"she was going to pick that one\" it sounds like if she has tried on dresses at all, she's been on the fence about the one she wanted until OP showed her hers.  I think most likely Christine has been scanning wedding dresses and had a few earmarked that she liked including OPs.

So with a nine month difference between the weddings I can guarantee that 99% of the guests wouldn't even notice if it was the same dress or not.\nBesides that, you bought it so why would you return it. If she wanted the same from the beginning she should've said something although I'm with everyone else in the comments, she probably saw it on you and decided she wants it now. Just wear it, she can figure out if she wants the same or another. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou purchased the dress that you wanted. Christine said she was going to pick out the dress. She had not done so yet.\n\nYou snooze you lose.\n\nHonestly, I don't like the way Christine is behaving here. She's behaving like an AH.\n\nBut then again, I truly don't understand why some women get so hyper competitive about weddings.", "What a weir coincidence. Your future sister in law wants the same dress as you. Not sus at all.\n\nNTA. You got your dress first, you didn't even have to show it to her- it looks to me like a sick power move on her part to prove she is more 'important' to the family you're both marrying into.", "OP's got a crystal clear view of her future with this family tho \n\nUnless her husband has got a titanium spine and is telling them all to shove it, she's gonna have it rough", "Indeed. \"Was going to\" is not the same thing as \"did\" - neither grammatically nor practically. OP is streets ahead of STBSIL in the dress-picking department and MIL is nuts siding with a future possibility over an actual past decision/expense.\n\nAnd I agree that Christine saw OP's dress and went like those seagulls in Finding Nemo: \"MINE, MINE, MINE!!!\"", "Yup, what looks good on the hanger and in your head, can look horrible on you in person.", "Or she hadn't found the one, but she saw OPs dress and went 'ohhh I want that one'\n\n\nBesides, if someone is getting married near you with half the same guests and you care about your dress being unique; you send her a photo of your choice first!", "Agreed, how did she know she was gonna choose a dress she had never seen before? It sounds like she really likes the dress and she wants it for herself. I tell the whole family to go pound sand.", "Also, if you have a child first, will you have to also return it because Christine has been in the family longer?", "I'm betting Christine is mad OP's wedding is first so she's trying to one up her.", "I'd take that statement from future MIL as a red flag tbh. It reeks of favoritism", "Hmm i would\u2019ve thought it was the other way around the way she\u2019s acting and how most posts of this caliber go. You\u2019re still nta I was just checking a theory", "don\u2019t be silly, she would just have to change her child\u2019s name on the birth certificate since christine rightfully called dibs to use it for her nonexistent first born. \n\nshe\u2019s been planning to start thinking about getting pregnant since before OP got pregnant so it\u2019s only fair.", "The only reason I remember my own is photographic evidence", "Yeah, and the same dress can fit two different body types completely different", "This reminded me so much of Friend\u2019s episode \u201cthe one with the cheap wedding dress\u201d. \n\nNTA, OP. You are Monica.", "NTA", "NTA. These bridezilla stories always amaze in their pettiness.", "NTA, seem like she saw it, liked it and then retroactively claimed it was always hers.", "NTA! \n\nOf course OP should not return it, it\u2019s just to see they reaction and try to calm down the environment. \n\nBtw talk with the future spouse about it to play the dumb about the dress and ignore everyone who talk about it specially MIL. \n\n\nI think OP should says when they call again \u201cI will pass by the stored nexts days to returned the dress I don\u2019t want nobody annoying me\u201d and turn off when they ask about it just give vague answers like \u201cyeah\u201d. \n\nI bet C will call a few hours later when knows the news asking about the dress \u201cWhere did u returned the dress?\u201d So u catch her in the lie and just reply \u201cwhat ? why u want to know?\u201d.\n\nAnd OP continues \u201cOh I went in the store and spoke with them and they did not accept custom brides dress after customizing only on my specific order, they said would cost too much for the next one to remodel it and will not worthy to sell it\u201d\n\nNormally the stores doesn\u2019t not keep much units of brides dress, because they said each dress is only made a few units and custom for each person. \n\nI believe C just want the OP dress.\n\nNormally when brides are buying dress for marriage in a few months of difference they exchange information and pictures and is not the case of C.", "NTA. How convenient that you chose her \"exact\" dress? I bet she'll change her mind another six times before she picks her actual dress and it won't be yours. Although kudos to your future MIL for letting her know where you stand in the family early on.", "NTA. Christine can go whistle.", "Generally speaking,  dresses like wedding dresses are not returnable.", "Not sure where you\u2019re from but no way to alter and customize a wedding dress in 2 months with our a crazy cost. And usually you can\u2019t even return formals. NTA but SIL is", "OP is NTA. BUT Christine and MIL are. OP if I were you I wouldn\u2019t share anything else with Christine. She can find things out like other people do. Be cordial but watch your back.", "Your wedding comes first...", "Hahahahaha...wtf. She probably saw it the first time you put it on and decided it's hers now? Yeah...NTA. she can go pick another.", "Nta ,you already  bought  your dress  ,she didn't, so tough luck for her. Enjoy your dress,wedding &marriage \ud83d\ude09", "NTA. Your future SIL is acting like a Bridezilla.\n\nShe can pick a different dress or she can deal with it. Do not back down and do not accept anyone blaming you. If I were you I would tell anyone that said anything that this is an upside down situation. Tell them you are getting married first and you picked out your dress without any input or suggestion from her. You have not taken anything from her and it is a bit crazy for her to say otherwise.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't speak up when you showed her your dress.  So it is NOT the asshole move but it is asshole move on her part for whining to her fiance and family.  Nope her out.  Besides you chose it first before she ever buys it or chooses it.", "NTA.  Tell the family you already started the alterations and it can\u2019t be returned, so having waited too long, she\u2019s out of luck, though you find the coincidence that she wants the exact dress you picked out seriously sus.  Then offer to have a family meeting soonest where she can share her wedding plans in front of everyone and you will try to avoid duplicating whatever she says at the meeting as long as it is specific (I want roses and a tiered cake is not specific, here\u2019s a picture of what I want is) but that\u2019s it.  If she isn\u2019t ahead of you in planning despite a 3 month lead, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA, Christine does not have the same dress. She hasn't bought it yet. Plus, most wedding dresses can't be returned. They are special order items. Frankly, I went to 2 weddings that were only one month apart. I only found out a year later that the brides had the same dress. Never noticed it. The basic silhouettes are repeated over and over again. Fit and  flair, ball gown. mermaid, etc.  Small details are changed. I just see lace, beads and frills.", "NTA.\nThree of the four sisters in law in my family have worn nearly identical dresses. We all looked different and we all looked wonderful and not one person, outside the sisters in law, noticed. It was like a fun inside secret.", "Nta you literally already bought it!", "NTA, we don\u2019t even really know if Christine chose that dress beforehand or if she just saw it and immediately wanted it", "NTA. I don't believe for one minute Christine chose that dress until she saw you had it. At best, she saw it after you bought it, decided she liked it, and is now pressuring you. At worst, she's gonna do this til you settle for stuff you don't like and has zero intention of using it. Tell her no, tell the family no, and good for your fiance for standing up to you. \n\nYour wedding, you do you, if they don't like it they don't have to come. \n\nEither this blows over or this is the beginning of the end of a relationship with his family. Just in case it's the second, work with your guy on a plan of action. If they refuse to drop it, how far do you plan on going? Eloping? Disinviting? Making it clear security WILL bounce their asses out of your wedding if anyone even gives you a dirty look? \n\nAnd in the future, don't include his family in planning. The wndwer to anything they ask should be \"Oh it's a surprise.\" And change the subject.", "NTA\n\nI see no reason why the both of you can\u2019t wear the same (or similar) dress. You\u2019re not wearing for HER wedding, you\u2019re wearing it for YOUR wedding. Not only that, your weddings are 9 months apart, so who the hell cares?", "NTA Christine hasn\u2019t even bought her dress yet and her wedding isn\u2019t until a year from now whereas your wedding is in a couple of months. There isn\u2019t time for you to get a new dress realistically. Just the shopping process alone could take months. Then, unless you buy off the rack, it has to be ordered, shipped, altered, etc., leaving a 2 month window not enough time. First wedding gets first choice. But now you know where you stand in this family. Are you sure you want to be tied to them for the rest of your life?", "Out of all the thousands of dresses she would exactly pick this dress ( but hasnt bought it yet... Has she even fitted it???) Sounds totally unbelievable to me tbh", "NTA. I have the feeling she saw yours, loved it, and claimed she saw it first.", "Nta.  You don't have enough time to get a new dress.  With alterations, you're going to be lucky to have the dress done in time for your wedding.  Dresses usually take months to be delivered and fitted properly.  Your sil needs to start seriously shopping for a dress.", "NTA this is a power and control move. Do not fall for it or give in.", "In fact, come February, she will be more a part of this family than Christina.", "Like it's OP's fault it took Christine 7 years to get engaged! Sounds like someone is jealous of OP not having to wait as long!", "Yup. MIL just showed you she will choose Christine over you in anything, always. NTA. You need to start practicing ignoring your MIL's and Christine's words and actions now because it sounds like you've got a lifetime of it coming.", "Probably also jealous that OP is six years younger than her", "Hi, my post about the bday dress was removed! But you were sweet to ask about it, I have updates if you want to message me", "NTA but now you know who mils favorite is.", "Lmao she\u2019s not a friend why she in your wedding", "NTA. The rule is first up best dressed.  Meaning if she wants that dress then she should have bought it before op. She didn't, so she's out.", "NTA and I would rescind the bridesmaid invitation while you\u2019re at it.", "How come she's not the AH  for trying to ruin your wedding?", "NTA.  What does length of time for Christine being in the family have to do with anything. You have the right to this dress. Especially since your wedding is sooner and it\u2019s going to be harder for you to change things. Worst case, flip a coin as to who gets the dress but the way your in laws are acting is very rude", "I smell jealousy \n\nNta", "Keep the dress and remember you\u2019re not part of that family and they probably don\u2019t want you to be especially asking and making those comments . \u201cBeen in the family longer.\u201dYeah I remember when my ex husbands father said that to me about SIL \ud83d\ude44", "NTA it\u2019s a dress and technically your wedding is first so she has time to find a new one if it really matters to her.", "NTA. Have they shown you pics of Christine trying on the dress and all the dated texts telling people that she found THE dress with a pic of it? No? Then it wasn\u2019t the dress she chose before she saw it on you. She saw it on you and decided that she wanted it for herself. If it was true that it was the dress she had chosen, she would have whipped out her phone and shown you a pic right there of her in it. It sounds like she is a selfish and manipulative person and MIL and BIL are enabling her. Ask for proof before even considering returning your dress.", "NTA she should have bought it then shouldn't she!\n\nGood on your fianc\u00e9 for telling his brother where to go, think he may also need a word with his mother!", "Lol. NTA. You could not alter the dress, and the two of you could have the exact same one at both of your weddings, and I guarantee that the only people that would notice would be you two and your MIL. Wedding guests don't tend to notice or care nearly as much as you think they might, especially with 9 months of time passing between the two events.", "NTA NTA NTA!! Please wear the dress OP", "Yeah, \"that's the one i was going to pick\" as the *bride*? That's not the kind of decision most brides waffle on, and if they are hovering between a few, we'll tough luck if someone else chooses one of them first, and you still have at least one other in your list you were clearly interested in prior to finding out one is taken, so congrats? You've had help getting the decision made by marketing down the choices for you!\n\nBut more likely is she'd never seen it before and just decided it's what she wants and she'll lie to get it, because that's a hell of a coincidence with all the choices out there!", "Better have your future husband have another conversation with his mother and end all discussion"]}
