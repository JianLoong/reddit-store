Your mom more so for not stopping vickys awful behaviour to you.

That is dictated by actions. Your mom and Vicky need to get off their high horse. \n\nGotta say, dad the secret GOAT for taking one look at the situation and going \"Girl drama. Not my rodeo.\"", "Nta", "NTA. And stand by it. \n\nTell your sister and mother that instead of being butt hurt that you like Hani more, they should be asking themselves Why that is when Vicky has had so many more opportunities to make herself your favorite but has failed to even be liked by you.", "The \"Vicky is more of a sister\" has always been a thing. Its so annoying tbh", "Dad thinks everything is \"girl drama\" \nAnd yes, Hani is really lovely!", "Yes tbh i know i shouldn't have said it even if it's the truth", "With sisters like Vicky, who needs enemies? Geez", "Biologically, yes Vicky is \"more\", but the true spirit of being sisters, the heart? Hani is your true sister.", "Your dad has a responsibility to protect you. He needs to step up now before he loses any more respect.", "Sounds like your dad isn't interested in actually doing any parenting.", "op=nta\n\nI'll let you into a little secret that you don't seem to be aware of.  YOU are allowed to have a Favorite sibling(and/or least favorite siblings).  You can even have a favorite parent(tho this you probably should keep to yourself unless it's for therapeutic reasons).  \n\nSO say, *Vicky, you were and are still being a bully. I have every right to express my admiration for Hani.  If you need a reason why I do admire her it is because she never bullied me and has always taken an interest and me and my life/pastimes.  She has done x & y to show me what I want to emulate in my life.  You have not done that and continue to show me disrespect.*\n\nTo your mother, say, *You allowed Vicky to bully me as a child and thought that was acceptable behavior.  Your continued permission is why I do not regard her with greater affection. \"More\" blood does not determine intensity of affection. Positive treatment does.  Instead of complaining to me, perhaps you should speak to Vicky about how she acts rather than judge what I feel.*\n\nAfter this stand firm with both, that they don't get to determine your level of affection or respect.  Also, consider asking your father to get them to leave you alone(not to address the favorite sibling thing, just to stop the harassment).\n\nAt 16, you can't just go no contact with your mother who I presume you are living with.

Your sister has a half sister (can we call this an affair baby) which is her age. I believe that is the WHY with her behavior towards you (kicking the proverbial dog) IOW the \"messy story\" regarding your parents. This screwed her up ok. NOT COOL NTL. Stand up for yourself and tell these women why you are upset and that you refuse to be their punching bag anymore.", "Gentle ESH\n\nVicky and your mom are both huge assholes for making this a big deal and cornering you.  But yeah, it\u2019s not great to admit you like your other sister better (same way, IMO, it\u2019s a bad move for a parent to say they prefer the other child)\n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong!  Morally you\u2019re in the right, and Vicky and your mom are being mean.\n\nAnd Hani sounds lovely.", "Nope. Hani's mom and our dad had been married for a few years before he met my mom", "Right? Sounds like the dad got two women pregnant and is uninterested in handling the emotional consequences.", "He never does much tbh, mom does everything and he is more of a provider", "NTA", "NTA", "Dad never wants to get involved in anything.\nVicky still lives with us so i have to see her every day", "Vicky is the affair baby", "She didn\u2019t even want a sister lmao", "So was your mom the other woman? I saw both of your sisters listed as being 21 years old, so looks like there might have been some relationship overlap there...", "Yes. I mean, she swears she wasn't but given the stories she tells us, it's obvious she was", "Yeah I used to call my dad that too. Then I grew up and learned the real term is emotional neglect", "Ok, that adds soooo much context to why they don't like her. I'd recommend adding it to the post because it explains alot."]}
