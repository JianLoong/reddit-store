No one seems to have an issue with that besides my husband. If he forgot something in the room he'll just waltz right in even if my camera is on or I'm off mute to speak, etc. It got to the point that I started locking the bedroom door and my mother has even posted signs on my door for me (\"presentation in progress, please do not disturb\"). To top this all off, it is well documented and he knows that I suffer from major anxiety that's also triggered by a tachycardia disorder I have (I'm on heart meds and everything), so someone just coming in the room has the potential to completely derail me. So last week I'm making the final and most important presentation of my graduate career, I have the door locked, I gave everyone 2 hours notice before class to come in and get anything needed, etc and my husband came down, unlocked the door from the outside and strolled right in to get everything he needed (opening doors, closing cabinets, etc making noise), etc. I did the best I could with it in the moment and finished out the class.

I was absolutely shocked at my ability to speak calmly because I knew if I didn't, I would say something so vile instead that I might not be able to recover from. Instead of apologizing to me or talking it out, he said that my requests and expectations are completely unrealistic and I make a big deal out of everything.

If he had not, we would not be together, because I had made all the changes a person could make in therapy myself. He had to do SOME of the damn work. Your husband may need to make changes, because maybe you have done all the thinking and introspection and emotional work that one person can do. It takes 2 people to make a relationship work, and as hard as you try, you can only put in your 100%, you can't put in the effort on his behalf. Hopefully, he will readily agree to therapy. My husband loves me and doesn't want to hurt me, we are on the same team. He wanted us to succeed, so he was willing to do the therapy and make the changes. I hope that your husband can do the same.
