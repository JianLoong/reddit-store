Every class I've asked multiple times for people (my husband, kids, parents or visitors) to stay out of my room while I'm in class because due to the professional and graduate level of courses, the professors ask that we maintain a certain decorum for classes. No one seems to have an issue with that besides my husband. If he forgot something in the room he'll just waltz right in even if my camera is on or I'm off mute to speak, etc. It got to the point that I started locking the bedroom door and my mother has even posted signs on my door for me (\"presentation in progress, please do not disturb\"). To top this all off, it is well documented and he knows that I suffer from major anxiety that's also triggered by a tachycardia disorder I have (I'm on heart meds and everything), so someone just coming in the room has the potential to completely derail me. So last week I'm making the final and most important presentation of my graduate career, I have the door locked, I gave everyone 2 hours notice before class to come in and get anything needed, etc and my husband came down, unlocked the door from the outside and strolled right in to get everything he needed (opening doors, closing cabinets, etc making noise), etc. I did the best I could with it in the moment and finished out the class. After class, I was burning with the rage of 1000 suns. My husband could tell I was upset and asked what I was mad about. I was seeing red so I went out of my way to control myself and speak in the calmest and most respectful way I could, literally in therapy type phrases saying things like \"the way you disregarded my requests made me feel completely disregarded and disrespected\". I was absolutely shocked at my ability to speak calmly because I knew if I didn't, I would say something so vile instead that I might not be able to recover from. Instead of apologizing to me or talking it out, he said that my requests and expectations are completely unrealistic and I make a big deal out of everything. He even spun it around on me and said \"well, what you're saying is you didn't want me to take the kids to the park since I needed stuff in there\". That statement doesn't even compute to me.

When I tried reasoning that literally half this country is doing work, school, etc from home and their families respect their work space he simply walked away from me and refused to speak the rest of the day.\n\nTL/DR: I locked my bedroom door for class and then told husband I felt disrespected because he ignored my request to stay out of the room while doing zoom class for grad school and unlocked the door and came in anyway.", "created_utc": 1676150932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zygjb/aita_for_locking_the_door_and_asking_people_to/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
