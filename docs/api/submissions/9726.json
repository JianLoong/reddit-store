{"id": 9726, "submission_id": "10zygjb", "title": "AITA for locking the door and asking people to stay out of the room while I'm in zoom meetings?", "selftext": "I've been in online classes for over 2 years but have finally reached the end of the semester and had my final presentation last week. Every class I've asked multiple times for people (my husband, kids, parents or visitors) to stay out of my room while I'm in class because due to the professional and graduate level of courses, the professors ask that we maintain a certain decorum for classes. No one seems to have an issue with that besides my husband. If he forgot something in the room he'll just waltz right in even if my camera is on or I'm off mute to speak, etc. It got to the point that I started locking the bedroom door and my mother has even posted signs on my door for me (\"presentation in progress, please do not disturb\"). To top this all off, it is well documented and he knows that I suffer from major anxiety that's also triggered by a tachycardia disorder I have (I'm on heart meds and everything), so someone just coming in the room has the potential to completely derail me. So last week I'm making the final and most important presentation of my graduate career, I have the door locked, I gave everyone 2 hours notice before class to come in and get anything needed, etc and my husband came down, unlocked the door from the outside and strolled right in to get everything he needed (opening doors, closing cabinets, etc making noise), etc. I did the best I could with it in the moment and finished out the class. After class, I was burning with the rage of 1000 suns. My husband could tell I was upset and asked what I was mad about. I was seeing red so I went out of my way to control myself and speak in the calmest and most respectful way I could, literally in therapy type phrases saying things like \"the way you disregarded my requests made me feel completely disregarded and disrespected\". I was absolutely shocked at my ability to speak calmly because I knew if I didn't, I would say something so vile instead that I might not be able to recover from. Instead of apologizing to me or talking it out, he said that my requests and expectations are completely unrealistic and I make a big deal out of everything. He even spun it around on me and said \"well, what you're saying is you didn't want me to take the kids to the park since I needed stuff in there\". That statement doesn't even compute to me. How does not being allowed in a room equate to me saying not to take care of the kids? Nothing he needed for the kids was in there whatsoever. He instantly spun it to become the victim. When I tried reasoning that literally half this country is doing work, school, etc from home and their families respect their work space he simply walked away from me and refused to speak the rest of the day.\n\nTL/DR: I locked my bedroom door for class and then told husband I felt disrespected because he ignored my request to stay out of the room while doing zoom class for grad school and unlocked the door and came in anyway.", "created_utc": 1676150932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zygjb/aita_for_locking_the_door_and_asking_people_to/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you and your husband have separate bedrooms? If not, are you doing your schooling in the bedroom, or an office? If its the bedroom, then it becomes YTA because its his room too. If you work in an office, then the same question comes up. Is it a shared office or your own personal office? If shared, does he also have times when not wanting you to come in? If its exclusively your space, then NTA but I have to ask why he would need to come in to get things?

I'm trying to make sure to get well rounded opinions because I know I'm not perfect but he's making me feel crazy.", "A lot of things he does comes across intentional but the childishness of it all makes me question it.", "I definitely get these vibes too. I try to keep an open mind and have an analytical approach so I've done a lot of research. I actually am starting to think he actually suffers from narcissistic personality disorder. His mother had a plethora of mental health issues so I'm not surprised but I don't know what this means for me or my marriage yet.", "He does have some fantastic other qualities for sure but I compare this to the love languages; even if you're amazing in all the other languages if you don't speak mine too we can't communicate at all. You could buy me all the gifts in the world for example but if we don't have quality time for example I still feel unloved.", "This definitely crossed my mind. I'm definitely trying to get third party unbiased feedback and scheduling counseling ASAP. I'm not the type to allow this to continue forever.", "Of course we share the same bedroom but I'm not sure your logic works out for me for a couple of reasons. 1. If he asks me to stay out and respect the boundary, I do so without issue. 2. The house does not have a formal office space (that must be nice) so this is the best set up I can do to be \"hidden away in a corner\" out of a more common area that would just be illogical to ask people to avoid and 3. The ENTIRE HOUSE is both of ours. We make equal salary and both pay for the house but by your logic since it's \"his room too\" I can never ask for some personal space within the entire confines of the entire house.", "Your husband is not stupid - he is actively trying to derail your career with this kind of stunt - particularly if it\u2019s repeated behaviour.\n\nBlaming you and then making some mental gymnastic bullshit to blame you - that is so toxic and abusive.\nYour husband is straight up using DARVO\nDo somthing very shitty then\n\nDeny blame\n\nAttack person who brought up the behaviour (you)\n\nReverse\nVictim and\nOffender\n\nSo the issue is no longer him trying to screw up your classes for you, it\u2019s about you being a bad mother and denying your kids something that was (not) in the room at that very point in time and there was absolutely nothing else in the world that could possibly have kept them alive and entertained. . . \n\nYou\u2019ve a major husband issue if this is standard behaviour form him OP.

Do not do couples therapy with an absuer, he is just going to twist it to try to control you. \n\nGood for you for working on your higher education.

I'll definitely be looking into this more.", "I have no idea honestly. He was so supportive of me to apply and everything but that has definitely not held up.", "Yes, that's another reason I'm suspecting narcissism. I can't speak to him at all with any type of constructive criticism. He either hangs up on me or walks away. Even speaking calmly and respectfully. You simply can't discuss/criticize with him. If he's in a situation he simply can't get away (such as on a car trip on something), he'll just say your wrong the entire time and disagree no matter what.", "I have one and they are amazing", "This is good to know. I mentioned in a previous comment that I've been doing a lot of research and am actually starting to truly suspect narcissist personality disorder", "What do you then suggest? I have no idea what to do at this point.", "Exactly the recommended  you NOT do counseling  with a Narc because they will use everything against you. The only thing you can do is decide to divorce or put up with it. They won't change.", "What about couples therapy. Could that help you talk through this kind of thing?", "In that case therapy will just be a way for him to further his bad treatment if you. You\u2019re better off out of there altogether. It won\u2019t get any better. There is no cure for NPD.", "Personal therapy might help you see better what your actual options are. This is above my pay grade. \n\nBut if he really is a narcissist then IMO it's simply not possible for him to be in a healthy relationship. Like his brain won't even allow it.", "That's what I'm worried about. My heart is breaking for my kids.", "Protecting your kids doesn\u2019t mean staying with someone like him though.", "My father was a narcissist. I prayed every day that my mother would leave him. \n\nI don't know your life. I don't know how he is with your children. It was common for affection to be transactional with my father. He loved me if I was exactly what he thought I should be. Any deviation was punished and entirely my fault according to him. \n\nLeaving isn't always the worst thing. \"Staying together for the sake of the kids\" is often worse. \n\nBut. I'm just an internet stranger. Talk to a therapist. Please.", "Thank you.", "Thank you for your insight!"]}
