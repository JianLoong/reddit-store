That guy was out of line.  Good for you standing up for yourself.", "NTA.

Dude was racist.", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't a you problem it was a him problem for blocking your drive way.", "Guy was a racist jackass.  You were right to stand up for yourself", "NTA. It's your driveway to use whenever you please. Fuck that guy!", "Woooow!\n\nNTA enough!", "NTA.  The driver was racist and you have every right to demand, however forcefully, he moves \nso you can park in your own driveway.\n\nI live near LA and am very sorry the city is treating you like this.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a \u201cyou\u201d thing it\u2019s a racist thing especially this guy\u2019s attitude.

He has to give you access to it. Plus he was racist", "NTA OP.  I would have called the cops on the guy.", "YTA  See instead of coming home and being an asshole and saying like an asshole \"How long do you plan to be here\" What  you could have done was been less of an asshole and said, hey, I need to get in and you're blocking my driveway, would you mind pulling up.  You know.  Like a non-asshole would have done.

He doesn\u2019t need to be overwhelmingly nice to someone who is clearly blocking his driveway.

Then the dude went and assumed that OP didn\u2019t own the property, which he had no reason to assume, and OP was totally reasonably annoyed and made him move.

Blocking someone\u2019s driveway is not legal, unless you\u2019re authorized to do so (ie road construction), and in that case OP would not have tried to park in it.
