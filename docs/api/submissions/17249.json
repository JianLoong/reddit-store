Except for once which I'll talk about below I have never cut or dyed anyone else's hair besides my own.\n\nDuring the pandemic while all the salons were closed because of the lock downs my brother's (27M) then girlfriend/now fianc\u00e9e (27F?) tried to dye her own hair and screwed it up badly. Her natural hair colour is black but she gets it coloured blonde. She has never dyed her own hair before and tried using a YouTube video to do it. It went very badly. She somehow managed to turn part of her hair green and the rest orange. My brother begged me to try and fix it because all the salons were closed and it was so bad she couldn't leave the house. I am not a jerk so I agreed. It took three sessions and a bunch of hours but I was able to fix the colour. I had to cut some of it off and give her side bangs because there was a lot of damage but in the end it got fixed and she was very happy with the results and so was my brother.\n\nNow she keeps asking me to do her hair again. She says both the colour and the cut were the best she's ever had and she can't find any hair stylist or salon that does it as good as I did. Plus she liked the fact that it was free. She wants me to do her hair going forward for free. That means colour every 6-8 weeks and trimming/cutting. For free. Even my brother is pushing me to do it because it \"means a lot to her\" and will \"make her happy\".\n\nI'm not a hair stylist. I have a different full time job. It would cost me money to do it for free, but even if she paid me costs and labour I still don't want to do it. I don't want to have to spend hours every 6-8 weeks doing her hair. I was a wreck the entire time I was fixing and cutting her hair because I was afraid I would make it worse and she would hate it. It's different than doing my own hair.\n\nI have a job, I'm married and I have a life and responsibilities. I'm not looking to be anyone's personal hair stylist, free or not. My brother and his fianc\u00e9e don't understand this and keep bothering me even after I said I can't. My brother tried to get our parents involved. My dad and my stepmom said I should do it because she's going to be family and it's a nice gesture. My mom and my stepdad agree with me about not doing it. I'm sure if we had any other living relative my brother would try to involve them too.\n\nI did it once as a favour because she made such a mess of it and it was so bad. I knew my brother was thinking of proposing and I did it because I'm not a jerk and she's important to him. But I'm not looking to make it a regular thing.
