I have Rory most of the time I pay for her schooling, medical, extra curriculars, ect. While Ida and Dan get her every other Holiday and don't really pay for stuff. Well For the 4th of July Rory went over to Ida and Dan's then stayed there until about a week before school started. Rory confided in me that the whole time she was there She couldn't really do anything fun and was stuck watching her younger siblings while Dan and Ida went out. She told me she felt like a babysitter more than a daughter, which hurt my heart for Rory, since she was really excited to see her mother. She also told me she'd like to stick with visits again and not staying for a whole month or 2.\n\nWell about 2nights ago I got a call from Ida, she seemed happy and started talking about Rory and how she liked it there. She continued to ramble a bit before asking for me to ask Rory about staying another month. I laughed which caused Ida to be mad and she hung up. Dan texted me calling me an ass for laughing at her, and my brother said it was kind of mean to do.

It was a natural reaction and I don't blame you one bit. If I had to guess, she probably believed that since she and Rory probably don't get along nor have the same relationship you and Rory have, she assumed Rory didn't tell you anything about being their babysitter. Oh well. Looks like your ex hasn't given up her penchant for lying.", "NTA\nProtect your daughter \nIf she feels that she doesn't want to go their anymore or wants to restrict her visits because of her mother's actions support her in this\nYou are doing the right thing by your child and that is all you need to do.", "NTA\n\nYou saw through your ex's BS and she got upset with it.  Sounds like you're doing what's best for your daughter, and Ida and Dan are upset about not having a free sitter any longer.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is 15, she can choose who she wants to live with. Make a request to the judge to change custody and make a request for her mother to pay her share of her daughter's expenses.", "NTA. Shes calling you to ask Rory because if she she asks Rory herself she knows she will say no. But if it comes from you, maybe she has a chance to get herself a free live in nanny.", "NTA - get a lawyer op. If Rory doesn\u2019t want to go back then you can make that happen with one. It\u2019s always refreshing to read about a parent that actually cares about their children", "NTA.  She doesn't want your daughter to stay to spend more time together.  She wants her to stay to extend the free babysitting service.  Time for your daughter to come home, and for your ex to start paying a babysitter if she wants to go out.", "NTA.\n\nLaughing can be an uncontrollable reaction to a horrible lie.  Simply tell Dan that if his wife is going to continue to make hilariously bad attempts to lie to get a free, live in nanny, you will continue to laugh at it.", "NTA I was the built in babysitter for my younger half siblings. I love them dearly but I didn't like being unpaid labor, and stuck home constantly. Don't let them use your daughter in this manner.  She is the one that is unhappy, she may even be too scared to tell her mom, so you must advocate on her behalf.", "NTA\n\nWhy is your brother prioritising your ex wife's precious feelings over your daughter? Your daughters safety and wellbeing is the top priority, always. No exceptions. His response is alarming, and not what you want your daughter to be learning when dealing with AH's. The greatest lesson my parents taught me was that it's not my job to manage other people's feelings. It's certainly not my responsibility to make my life worse to placate others. Don't let your brother teach your daughter that. Please.", "NTA. You laughed because you KNOW the reason she was calling....free babysitting and as far as you're concerned they are just a big joke.  I'd be laughing all the way to the house to pick up my daughter.", "NTA!! Now that she\u2019s 15 it maybe time to adjust the custody agreement!!", "NTA. If you don't want to be laughed at, don't act like a clown.", "NTA. She\u2019s mad she won\u2019t have a free babysitter.", "NTA. \n\nThey think you don\u2019t know that your child is their live-in babysitter\u2026.", "Nta\n\nNice? OP, you're fine. Civility is a must because, ya know, we like to think of ourselves as decent. But a cheater never deserves nice. Because every cheater I have known takes \"nice\" as condonement for and acceptance of their behavior.", "NTA NTA NTA. Best dad ever and once again NTA.\n\nFuk the witch. Lol.\n\nAs a daughter who lost her dad young, your daughter is blessed to have a dad like you.\n\nOnce again NTA.", "NTA You know why she wants her there and she realised you know and she\u2019s embarrassed that she not only got caught but that you laughed at her and her pathetic behaviour. She feels humiliated bc she knows how wrong this is and that your daughter _didnt_ enjoy it.", "NTA they just want free babysitting and Rory hated it", "Nope, screw them both. Get your daughter back and forget those 2 losers, Rory certainly will once she\u2019s 18", "Wait till your daughter starts laughing at her. Good luck.", "NTA.  I don't know if it was intentional or not, sometimes i can't help but let a laugh out.  But it sounds like they really want her there for babysitting purposes, and that isn't fair to your daughter.  I'm sure she feels badly about not having a closer relationship with her, and then this just makes it worse.", "I was 16 when my parents divorced 15 for the initial split and I got to choose who to live with. Honestly I used to hate holidays how much time to spend with whom. It was exhausting  but if she does not want to she is old enough to make that decision", "NTA - your daughter is not a babysitter and your ex is still a liar.", "NTA. I mean, the whole timing of it was pretty funny. I would contact ex wife and explain that you laughed bcuz of the timing of the whole thing and that just before she called Rory had already expressed her feelings about staying over for extended periods of time and that you won't make her do anything she doesn't want to do.", "NTA. You are protecting your daughter. You may want the court to decide whether she can avoid going to mom\u2019s house.", "Nta who cares about your exs feelings. Bring your kid home and be the bad guy when the longer visits come back up", "NTA. She knows your daughter doesn't want to be there serving as an au pair. She just lives being able to dump everything on someone else.", "Nta. Your ex can hire a babysitter to watch her kids if she wants to go out. I\u2019m glad your sticking up for your daughter", "NTA, daughter's choice.", "NTA. Your daughter told you what she wants and you only have to take her wishes into account. It doesn't matter what your ex wants (free babysitting).", "NTA. Ida sounds clueless at best.\n\nI don't blame you for laughing, but I'd suggest to try to hold it together for Rory's sake in case Ida's going to be shitty the next time she sees Rory.", "NTA \n\nYou laughed because it\u2019s ridiculous that she\u2019s was saying Rory likes it there, only to snow you into letting her come for another month to be her free babysitter. We all laughed, because your ex wife is fucking joke.", "NTA.....  Though more tact could have been employed. The reality is, there's animosity between you and Ida caused by her infidelity and she should expect such responses", "NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLetting your daughter decide is great parenting.", "She was asking for something ridiculous and you laughed, not a big deal.  Keep to the schedule in the custody order and pick your daughter up in the day it specifies.", "NTA. You reflex laughed because you knew the full ridiculousness of the situation. Your ex just wanted another month of free babysitting and you knew your daughter wasn\u2019t getting the bonding experience she desired. You saw it for what it was, ex just using your daughter, and it would be hard for anyone to not have an instant unplanned emotion. Your \u201cfuck no\u201d response automatically came out as a laugh, it happens.", "NTA. I think you laughed out of the sheer audacity of your ex in wanting to use your daughter as a free sitter for her younger children. I would have laughed, too. She's asking you to ask Rory because she knows that Rory didn't enjoy her visit and how much of an AH she and Dan were to push childcare on her.\n\nLaughing aside, I think you need to call her back when this has cooled off and let her know that Rory is not there to be their nanny for their kids when she does visit. If Ida and Dan want to go out and Rory is visiting, they need to ensure there's a sitter for their children.", "Rory is old enough to make the decision to visit or not and no one can force her. Period. Ask Rory what SHE wants. Ask her to think about it and let you know, and that you will support her decision. The SD needs to keep his mouth shut and out of your texts unless he is named in the visitation order. You don't have to deal with him at all when it comes to your child. A lot of judges won't even allow the new partner or spouse in the courtroom during finalizing these situations because it does not involve them. \n\nYou are NTA and I hope Rory feels safe enough to say what SHE wants and that the adults in this really consider her wants/needs.", "NTA - ofc mother is happy, she\u2019s getting free childcare by exploiting her daughter. \n\nGet her out of there asap. Poor kid.", "NTA.", "NTA. \n\nFWIW I wouldn't respond to D's text. This isn't his business. I'm sorry your ex is treating your daughter like a babysitter. I agree that going to the strict agreement is best, if renegotiation is not an option. Get the courts on your side if you do want to renegotiate.", "NTA. Regardless of the situation having a moment of laughter at someone's request could be considered a little rude but the recipient is being WAY TOO sensitive.", "nta - good for you (side note i find it really funny how they have both the male and female name of Quagmires dad in family guy) ahahah", "NTA\n\nYour ex has proved herself to be not just a crappy wife but a crappy parent. She threw away all her good parenting at the same time as your marriage apparently.", "NTA", "Nta. The response to this is \u201ckeep trying to use her as a free babysitter and I\u2019m gonna sue for back child support \u201c", "NTA.  It was just a response.  Ida really seems thin-skinned to be this upset.  Especially since you didn't share what Rory told you.  Oh well.  Doesn't really matter what Ida thinks.  I would let Rory know about this conversation though, so she's not blindsided by Ida.", "NTA - I would have laughed, too, honestly. It's clear that your ex doesn't care much for your daughter past the free babysitting. I bet your ex had a wonderful summer where she had so much free time at the expense of Rory, and is hoping you can help guilt your daughter into enduring it on a regular basis.", "NTA\n\nSometimes you can not hold it back. They are terrible  for making her babysit that much.", "NTA\n\nI'm glad your daughter can confide in you and you're doing your best for her!", "No, nta", "NTA. Sorry but I laughed when reading so I can see how it was just a gut reaction. \n\nGood for you for keeping your daughters needs as the number one priority.", "NTA, they want a free babysitter, they can get bent, if your kid doesn't want to spend time with them and want to change dynamics, let her, consult a lawyer if need, so they can force her, she is almost a legal adult so then she can told them to get bent", "Youre good bro.", "NTA - you laughed because in their obliviousness they thought no one caught on that they liked having a forced lie-in babysitter so they didn't have to watch ANY of the kids.\n\n...and they were wrong and shocked because... why wouldn't she want to stay and do nothing but watch their other kids?!?! I mean, she had *such a GREAT time*! /s\n\nIf they are offended or confused as to why you laughed, maybe they should spend some time with said teenager instead of thinking they had free childcare.", "NTA be the \u201cbad guy\u201d on your daughters behalf and stick to the visitation schedule.", "Rory isn't a temporary parent for her step siblings. The point of visiting her mom is to maintain their connection, not for her to be parentified and take over raising her mom's new kids. \nNTA protect your kid, please make sure she continues to be safe enough to share her real feelings with you.", "NTA. She knew Rory was miserable, but your ex didn't know you knew that.  She was going about getting a free babysitter in a manipulative way and making you part of her manipulation of Rory.\n\nI'm happy you listened to your daughter's feelings.  It's hard for women to be treated like that; many walk away feeling less confident.  Maybe the two of you could go out together and do something fun, something specifically Rory enjoys, so her heart knows she is seen and appreciated by at least one parent.\n\nEdit for spelling", "NTA, but maybe you should clarify with her, that you're not preventing Rory from going by any means, it is her choice to not be used as a nanny.", "NTA. Rory needed you to step up and step in. Good on you for looking out for her. Your ex better hire somebody to watch her other kids. Good grief. \n\nNo one owes your ex and her husband respect or childcare. When you act like an a-hole, people treat you like one.", "NTA-your kid was forced to parent her half siblings so your ex and her dimwit of a husband could go have a social life. Seems to be that your ex is basically a user, and wants free child care. Tell her to pound sand.", "NTA\n\nYou're almost to the end of the tunnel, OP!  In a few years, you won't have to deal with your ex anymore.  As far as the chuckle goes?  Well, sometimes if someone says something absurd, that happens.", "NTA\n\nYou were likely so shocked at the sheer audacity of the lie, it just slipped out.\n\nBefore you \"officially\" decline, please come to an agreement with Rory on who is taking the fall for the refusal and why. i.e. if Rory isn't ready for her mom to know, are you willing to be the bad guy and say Rory can't go because of you?\n\nThat way, you two present a united front on the same page. Because obviously her mom doesn't talk to her.", "Nta \nShe just wants a free babysitter. Thank you for respecting your daughter request", "Siblings aren't automatically babysitters. NTA", "First, NTA. I'm afraid I would have done the same thing. Second, I don't know where you are at, but when my stepdaughter turned 14, she was legally allowed to decide where she wanted to live. She chose my husband (her father) and I. We're in Wisconsin. I have heard similar things about other states. Good luck!", "You laughed because you Ida said something laughable. Only Ida and Dan liked Rory being there, because apparently Rory didn't enjoy it. And even more sad, Ida didn't bother to find out how Rory felt herself. NTA.", "NTA\n\n Her request was laughable.", "Ask Dan whether he thinks she's fucking another guy behind his back, too.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nLaughing at her lies was a perfectly normal human reaction. \n\nYour ex is upset she lost free childcare.  Good that Rory is old enough to have input in custody now.", "NTA whatsoever, not even for laughing. It IS a funny situation because Ida seems to think Rory had a wonderful time being parentified. Rory is more than old enough to decide where and how to spend her free time, within reason ofc. Follow her lead, and thank you for being the kind of parent who takes their child's comfort into consideration.", "Did you tell her why Rory doesn't want to go?", "Nta , f her", "It\u2019s a laughable request after your daughter told you how her visit went. Unintentionally hurt feelings, sure but she\u2019s an asshole for not paying attention to her daughter while she had her there and making her a live-in babysitter. You are not the asshole", "NTA. You laughed at something funny. How is that rude?! Thank you for having your daughter\u2019s back!", "I don't know if it's full AH but it seems a bit childish. Just say \"no\" and be done with ensuing drama", "NTA", "[deleted]", "ESH for calling the kid Rory. God I hope its a nickname", "JAH Justified AssHole\n\nWhile I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect older siblings to watch younger siblings from time to time, your daughter made it seem like it was constant.  Like she was just there to babysit.  That's wrong.  While you were an asshole, I'd say it was justified.", "ESH. I\u2019m on your side but bro have some fucking decency. Constantly calling the stepdad \u201cthe D bag\u201d and the ex \u201cthe witch,\u201d you sound ten years old. You have kids for gods sake and it\u2019s kinda sounding like you\u2019re less mature than your 15 year old. Do better. Jesus.", "YTA for laughing.  You should have been more polite.", "I'd say YTA and YNTA\n\nRegardless of whatever happened before with you guys and more recently with your daughter she's still her mother, laughing at the suggestion is a bit of a rude way to handle it.\n\nbut at the same time it seems your ex is oblivious, at least from what you told us, maybe try asking her if she feels R would want to stay another month and that you'd talk to R about it.", "ESH. \n\nI completely understand why you laughed, but you need to deal with this woman for the sake of your daughter for the next couple of years. Laughing was needlessly antagonistic. Laugh to your friends about it afterwards, don\u2019t make an already hard relationship any harder. \n\nEx is the asshole for obvious reasons.", "I read a lot of bitterness, resentment, and embellishment here. You\u2019re purposely trying to turn your daughter against her mom and stepdad. For that alone YTA. This isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s about making sure your kids have a healthy relationship with their parents. ALL of them.", "So ... am I the asshole for mocking someone (laughing at their request)? \n\nYes, YTA. If you want to go, ESH that is  definitely arguable. But remember (and here's the secret reasoning), two assholes do not make non-asshole; instead, they make two assholes. Congrats on joining the assholery.", "Yeah, YTA, it\u2019s rude, also childish, you have adult children who are probably more mature than you", "The laughing is why YTA .  Next time be an grown up and simply tell her that two months was long enough and Rory wants to come home.", "As usual, unpopular opinion here.\n\nSo\u2026\nYou resent your ex-wife for infidelity\u2026 14? 10? years ago (basing this on numbers/statements in your post). You also hate her husband. Your feelings are understandable, of course, but acting on them?\n\nYou claim that Tory told you she was unhappy, but her sibling seems to say otherwise. Also, you do realize that kids play parents against one another in this manner, yes?\n\nGet on with your life. Stop using your children as weapons.\n\nI hope that you well-altered the names and ages of all, so if they stumble upon your post they won\u2019t see what an AH you are being.\n\nWhat does Rory REALLY want? Shouldn\u2019t you be happy that she wants to bond with her mother and step? Wouldn\u2019t you do what you could to help in that regard? Don\u2019t you, as a father, want a happy, well-adjusted daughter?\n\nI guess if she is scared, maladjusted, and miserable, you can just blame her mother.", "The laugh was inappropriate you should have said I will ask Rory (if you are from the US that's an awful name for a girl btw unless it's a nickname) \n\nThen either they'd forget about it or you can tell them later oh Rory said she just wants to do short one day stays due to her being a babysitter", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However - forcing a child after they reach a certain age to spend time at the non-custodial parent's home is not optimal, and nor will many courts require that.\n\n Again, it will vary depending on what state OP lives in, and the family courts in his jurisdiction.  However, have seen where a minor child of approximately the same age decided they wanted to live with dad full time after mother had primary custody.  Mom does have visitation but the child chooses not to spend that visitation with mom.  (Teenager, mom and child having issues probably due to normal teenage desire to have more autonomy and mom not quite ready for that.)  Hopefully after the child goes through teenage years, he and mom can re-connect but for now, child chooses not to see mom on the designated week-end visits.  \n\nOnce children reach about 16, high school age and driving age - it's counter-productive to force them to spend time with a non-custodial parent if they do not wish to do so.
