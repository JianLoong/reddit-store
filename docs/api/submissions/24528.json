The attorney will likely be able to get a significant lead on your side because you were not only supporting your family but also his, and in this situation (learned from a former divorce attorney), it wouldn't look good for him putting his other family ahead of his own immediate family.

My Sunday school teacher was from Syria/Palestine and he openly told our class that if his mother told him to divorce his wife (a white Christian who married him, eventually converted to Islam, started wearing hijab and so on) he would do it. His mother\u2019s will and his need to respect her was the biggest priority to him. I\u2019ve seen other guys who were happy to have their girlfriends and then wives wear whatever they wanted, go out with them to bars, and have a partnership in household tasks, but the second they are around family or their parents move in during elderly age? Suddenly the wife is out of line to expect to continue in that way when her duty is to take care of the labor to care for his parents while he dotes on them and takes credit. The clothes become a problem, no more bars/dates, the lack of cultural knowledge etc - they want their white wife but with all the service traits of a traditional one from a small village who is grateful to be allowed to live with his family.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous of course. But it\u2019s fairly common for the switch to flip and very uncommon for them to pick their wife once it does.
