The attorney will likely be able to get a significant lead on your side because you were not only supporting your family but also his, and in this situation (learned from a former divorce attorney), it wouldn't look good for him putting his other family ahead of his own immediate family.  You need to take control of your house again and your husband again, because he's not going to back down until he either relinquishes his control or decides to support his mother on his own.", "nta. if they want fresh food, they can cook. it'll be nice for you to come home to a warm meal after a long day.", "NTA.\nBut here is the thing - your husband might be right when he says that you should think about leaving, not in the way he intended though. He wants you to learn Arabic (not a simple language) to be a better servant of his mom's. He wants you to cook and clean for her, or else. He redirects a lot of family resources for her. He threatens you , when you express a valid concern.\nWhat does he bring to the table? And what are the chances that you would be better without him? Alimony and child support may leave you in a better state than you are now, just saying.", "NTA, but in her culture you may be. Which sucks. \n\nMy husband is from India. He is used to freshly cooked food. At first he wasn\u2019t sure if eating cooked and frozen food was safe, or if a slow cooker can be left unattended (that\u2019s the whole point!). He now happily eats food that I cooked and frozen, and from the slow cooker.\n\nI do think you have a husband problem. I would seriously consider his suggestion to leave (or make him and MIL leave).", "> He ... told me that I should think about leaving.\n\nCongrats on your freedom. Also NTA.", "NTA, take his advice and think about leaving.", "NTA as someone from a similar style of culture, I have to say that I\u2019ve seen this before. (Some) Guys are happy to have the American/western relationship and wife but when it comes to their family, they cannot get past cultural norms. My Sunday school teacher was from Syria/Palestine and he openly told our class that if his mother told him to divorce his wife (a white Christian who married him, eventually converted to Islam, started wearing hijab and so on) he would do it. His mother\u2019s will and his need to respect her was the biggest priority to him. I\u2019ve seen other guys who were happy to have their girlfriends and then wives wear whatever they wanted, go out with them to bars, and have a partnership in household tasks, but the second they are around family or their parents move in during elderly age? Suddenly the wife is out of line to expect to continue in that way when her duty is to take care of the labor to care for his parents while he dotes on them and takes credit. The clothes become a problem, no more bars/dates, the lack of cultural knowledge etc - they want their white wife but with all the service traits of a traditional one from a small village who is grateful to be allowed to live with his family.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous of course. But it\u2019s fairly common for the switch to flip and very uncommon for them to pick their wife once it does.  The second wife usually is someone from their culture and then they and the family crow about what a mistake the first one was and how much better life is now.", "You should think about leaving?

If you leave then he can cater to his mom which I doubt he will. And she can start cooking at times to share some of the dishes she is use to. Hard to believe leftovers are thrown away. NTA.  Your hubby is turning against you in favor of his mom. Some religions in Middle East forbid wasting food. How is she usually agreeable? I fail to see it. You have bent enough it sounds like.", "NTA- but did you and hubby talk about his mother moving in before hand? Did he say anything that indicated that if you did not make his mother happy that it would end your relationship? I'm sorry, but if hubby is ready to part ways over home cooked meals for his mom- bye guy.", "NTA - you really should consider leaving. This is a toxic situation and it doesn't sounds like its going to get better anytime soon.", "NTA, if she doesn't want to eat leftovers she can go back too where she came from. Your husband's right, you should thinking about leaving their entitled butts. Big issue that that was his response.", "He said what now? You should think about leaving? I'm worried. This sounds like a bait and switch situation. \n\nI do the two-three day meal thing, too, and couldn't do otherwise. It's a whole different ballgame to stop that. \n\nNTA and I'm worried about your husband's attitude.", "NTA.

However, I will also say, that unfortunately you were ill-prepared for the fact that it was likely always the plan that she was going to come and live with her son. Yes, in a lot of countries, leftovers are NOT eaten (because they do not have proper food storage, or did not until recently). Also, it IS likely that they food that you are preparing is causing her stomach issues, because that is something that happens to anyone, when eating a diet that they are not used to eating. I am surprised that your husband did not try and teach you some Arabic sooner. Also, your mother-in-law likely comes from a place where the daughter-in-law IS treated like a servant. I have no idea why your husband would think that you, who is NOT from there, would agree to this. Your husband should have prepared his mother for the cultural differences, and she should be cooking her own food and doing things to help out. BUT, for whatever reason, your husband did not prepare either of you for the realities, and unless you want to be their unpaid slave, probably best to get out and live your life for yourself.", "I\u2019m honestly flabbergasted that he said you should \u201cthink about leaving.\u201d I feel like that told me all I need to know and it says a lot about how he values you as well.", "If your MIL has come to live in a English speaking country, then she is the one who needs to learn to speak English, not you learning her language.", "So you cooked for 2-3 days and ate leftovers to save money, so you can send that money to her, only to hear from her that she throws away the food?\n\nNTA they clearly didn't need the money. She doesn't respect you.\n\nIf your husband wants you to leave, look out for your kids custody", "NTA. The statement \"you should think about leaving.\" For not catering to his mother should answer all your questions and concerns.  He did not care if you had money. Supporting his mother came 1st. The question is, how long are you going to be able to tolerate it before your divorce.  He wants and she expects her to be treated like a queen. That is the culture.  They are probably from India.", "You\u2019re dating a man that still sucks his mother\u2019s teets (figuratively). Leave him.

I understand there might be a cultural aspect to this situation, but you are being disrespected in your own home. If it\u2019s not meals, it\u2019ll be something else.

They can cook their own meals.", "NTA...\nIf he wants that, he should have stayed in the middle East where it's normal....", "As a middle eastern this so Out of the Norm were generally Muslim and we don\u2019t throw away food unless its going to rot or go to waste and most people here are so generous i Mean people argue over paying bills for eachother and when people visit all the aunties  and sometimes the uncles come together to make a big meal that sometimes lasts for weeks", "Nta. You have a major husband AND mil problem", "NTA\n\nHe should start doing the cooking so you and mom can do some language lessons. Mom gets fed and you learn Arabic. Everybody wins.", "NTA. You'll probably be faced with the choice between yourself, your freedom and your career on one side and staying with him and being their family's maid on the other, at some point. This is just the start. Give in now and you will find yourself constantly giving in for the rest of your life. Their expectation will always be for you to be a housewife an only a housewife. They will not value your responsibilities outside the home. A lot of young Arab men act 'progressive' until you're so emotionally invested, leaving is guaranteed heartbreak, and then progressively turn on their conservatism.", "NTA\n\nAlso, my family is Middle Eastern, and we love leftovers! When a meal has been amazing, but you can\u2019t fit any more in, why wouldn\u2019t you be excited to get to eat some more tomorrow? (So long as it\u2019s a food / meal that stores and/or reheats well, obviously.)\n\nServing a guest is a little bit different. As in, if you invited guests over for dinner, some people may feel offended if you just heated up leftovers to serve them. \n\nBut your MIL now lives with you. She\u2019s not a guest over for dinner, she\u2019s an everyday member of the household. \n\nIf daily cooking is a requirement of her stay, your husband can step up and start cooking too. Or he can hire a cook. \n\nYou\u2019re working, cleaning, caring for children, and also cooking for the household.
