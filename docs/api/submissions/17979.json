About a week into dating she told me that she was trans, mtf. I accepted this and had no problem with dating her. She was happy and as I've said me and 17f have been dating for 6 months. She has met my family multiple times and about a month ago she told them she was trans as well. Everyone accepted or if they didn't they kept their mouths shut. Everyone except one.\n\nMy sister 24f got huffy and started to ignore my gf. She asked me later how I expected to have kids one day if I was dating a fake woman. I told her to shut up and I don't want kids anyway. She got quiet and that was that. My sisters wedding is in 3 months and she sent out invites to rsvp a few days ago. Everyone is allowed to bring a +1 I choose my gf and sent in the rsvp. Today she came by and while hanging out with my parents she told me my gf couldn't come. When I asked why she said and I quote \"I don't want a delusional boy at my wedding\" at first I wondered why she thought I was delusional, and then I realized she was talking about my gf. I told her to take that back and she said she's only speaking the truth. I called her a transphobe and said that either me and my gf go or I don't go at all. She said she's \"not letting that creep into my wedding\" . So I said to not expect me there either.\n\nShe laughed like she thought I wouldn't follow through with it. But I withdrew my rsvp and threw her wedding gift in the trash. Now she's pissed and is getting everyone else involved. My parents are staying neutral. My sisters fiance is actually on my side (love that guy) along with our other siblings and my uncle. My aunt and cousin's  are on mysjsters side and and some are pressuring me to go because it's my sister's big day. Others want me to just keep the peace, and my aunt was just as translhobic as my sister. My gf said I don't have to destroy my relationship with my sister over her buy I told her that if my sister was like this then it would have ended someday anyway so it might as well be now. \n\nBut I'm wondering, aita for splitting the family up between supporting me and supporting my sister", "created_utc": 1684842988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pmdbv/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't be having kids with her either if I was him, mostly because I know how she'll react if they are trans. \n\nOP, keep it up.

If she does not support your gf why should you support her marriage or even her?", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is the one who made this a big family issue by getting them involved.

I doubt I would have had the same reaction if someone I was dating told me they were trans at your age.\n\nRegardless, having a will of your own means you can choose to make all sorts of decisions.  Including not attending some bigots wedding, even if she is your sister.\n\nShe has the right to refuse an invite to anyone, just like anyone has the right to decide not to go. Seems she forgot that little fact. She is not the centre of the universe, and she should stop acting like it.\n\nStay strong and proud of what you are doing!", "NTA, you're free to make your own decision, and it's not like you said \"stand with me or agains me\" so the split part is them arguing over their own opinios, not your fault, good that you know how to stand your ground.

I hope cable networks drop Fox News before this metastasizes further.", "NTA in any way. You're not the one splitting up the family, your sister and those who side with her are. You're not the one creating a problem, they are. If the family has problems later because of this, it's entirely on them.

At 17 I definitely wasn't as put together as you. Stay strong man", "NTA, you did what was right. Transphobia is unacceptable and you stuck by your girlfriend. This is on your sister, to hell with her big day.", "... My first reflex was to think this story is fake, because a 17 yo boy that learns that his gf  was born male clearly don't have the maturity to accept it and continue dating them.\n\nBut hell, if this story is true, good for you. You already show a lot of wisdom for being able to love a person for who they really are, and not what genitals they were born with.\n\nAnd, I would argue that YOU didn't make the decision to not go.

It isn't quite clear in your post.\n\nRegardless, your love life and how/if you have kids has no bearing on your sisters lift.\n\nGood on you for standing up for your girlfriend.  I wouldn't be going either.  That's because of your sisters bigotry.  And in reality unless your partner goes around with a big neon sign on her forehead saying she's trans... then no one is going to know otherwise.  Your sister is the one drawing attention to herself and telling everyone the deal.\n\nBut I would suggest to your partner that she be selective with who she tells.  It isn't any one's business but I'm thinking of her safety if someone takes umbrance at what she says.  It's not right but you do have to be careful.", "NTA - Nope, stick to your guns.

You haven\u2019t done anything least of all split your family up your sister did that all by herself.", "NTA. \n\nGood for you for sticking to your guns. Your sister sounds like a transphobic jerk. A wedding is about the bond of love. If you accept your girlfriend, no matter what/who she is and the fact you love her for such, than your sister should be supportive and do just as such. Also, how do you think your girlfriend feels? It's bad enough when society has to shame transgender people and the whole LGBTQ+ community, but now she's being told she can't come to a wedding because of who she is? Don't go to her wedding. Stick to it. I'm sorry you've had to split up your family, but even when her soon to be husband is on your side, you know your sister is being a complete AH about the entire situation.", "NTA.
