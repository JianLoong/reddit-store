About a week into dating she told me that she was trans, mtf. I accepted this and had no problem with dating her. She was happy and as I've said me and 17f have been dating for 6 months. She has met my family multiple times and about a month ago she told them she was trans as well. Everyone accepted or if they didn't they kept their mouths shut. Everyone except one.\n\nMy sister 24f got huffy and started to ignore my gf. She asked me later how I expected to have kids one day if I was dating a fake woman. I told her to shut up and I don't want kids anyway. She got quiet and that was that. My sisters wedding is in 3 months and she sent out invites to rsvp a few days ago. Everyone is allowed to bring a +1 I choose my gf and sent in the rsvp. Today she came by and while hanging out with my parents she told me my gf couldn't come. When I asked why she said and I quote \"I don't want a delusional boy at my wedding\" at first I wondered why she thought I was delusional, and then I realized she was talking about my gf. I told her to take that back and she said she's only speaking the truth. I called her a transphobe and said that either me and my gf go or I don't go at all. She said she's \"not letting that creep into my wedding\" . So I said to not expect me there either.\n\nShe laughed like she thought I wouldn't follow through with it. But I withdrew my rsvp and threw her wedding gift in the trash. Now she's pissed and is getting everyone else involved. My parents are staying neutral. My sisters fiance is actually on my side (love that guy) along with our other siblings and my uncle. My aunt and cousin's  are on mysjsters side and and some are pressuring me to go because it's my sister's big day. Others want me to just keep the peace, and my aunt was just as translhobic as my sister. My gf said I don't have to destroy my relationship with my sister over her buy I told her that if my sister was like this then it would have ended someday anyway so it might as well be now. \n\nBut I'm wondering, aita for splitting the family up between supporting me and supporting my sister", "created_utc": 1684842988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pmdbv/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 906, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
