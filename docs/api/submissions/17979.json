About a week into dating she told me that she was trans, mtf. I accepted this and had no problem with dating her. She was happy and as I've said me and 17f have been dating for 6 months. She has met my family multiple times and about a month ago she told them she was trans as well. Everyone accepted or if they didn't they kept their mouths shut. Everyone except one.\n\nMy sister 24f got huffy and started to ignore my gf. She asked me later how I expected to have kids one day if I was dating a fake woman. I told her to shut up and I don't want kids anyway. She got quiet and that was that. My sisters wedding is in 3 months and she sent out invites to rsvp a few days ago. Everyone is allowed to bring a +1 I choose my gf and sent in the rsvp. Today she came by and while hanging out with my parents she told me my gf couldn't come. When I asked why she said and I quote \"I don't want a delusional boy at my wedding\" at first I wondered why she thought I was delusional, and then I realized she was talking about my gf. I told her to take that back and she said she's only speaking the truth. I called her a transphobe and said that either me and my gf go or I don't go at all. She said she's \"not letting that creep into my wedding\" . So I said to not expect me there either.\n\nShe laughed like she thought I wouldn't follow through with it. But I withdrew my rsvp and threw her wedding gift in the trash. Now she's pissed and is getting everyone else involved. My parents are staying neutral. My sisters fiance is actually on my side (love that guy) along with our other siblings and my uncle. My aunt and cousin's  are on mysjsters side and and some are pressuring me to go because it's my sister's big day. Others want me to just keep the peace, and my aunt was just as translhobic as my sister. My gf said I don't have to destroy my relationship with my sister over her buy I told her that if my sister was like this then it would have ended someday anyway so it might as well be now. \n\nBut I'm wondering, aita for splitting the family up between supporting me and supporting my sister", "created_utc": 1684842988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pmdbv/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 389, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are NTA for not wanting to attend.", "NTA\n\nIf my GF wasn't invited to the wedding because of who she is and my sister was slandering her, I would also refuse to go on principle.\n\nShe might be able to decide who is invited or not (although the fact that the fiance is taking your side, maybe he'd like for your gf to be there but the bride is vetoing him?), but she can't mandate that the people that she invites comes. \n\nYou're not dividing the family or trying to make people take sides. She is.", "NTA. Your sister is throwing a transphobe party and since you aren't transphobic you really shouldn't attend. Just because she's dressing it up as a wedding doesn't make it any different.", "NTA and good for you! It's hard to tell your family to shove their transphobia and hate up their ass. I'm glad you did. Don't worry sister won't be invited to your wedding either and I hope you and your gf have a long and happy relationship. Glad the rest of your family supports you. It's sad that people cant just be happy for you but sister is tearing the family not you...she's the one pushing her ideas onto everyone.", "NTA - and I am counting your parents amongst the assholes\n\nShe might be an adult, but she is still their daughter and they should be calling her out on her transphobia \n\nI have no idea how they look your GF in the eyes knowing they allowed someone to be transphobic about her and their house and did nothing \n\nYou and your GF might break up eventually, but your morals will stay the same, and you don\u2019t trick with transphobes", "Yeah, is she going to disown her kids if someday they come out as trans or gay or aren't the perfect fantasy child that she dreamed of them being? Is she going to call them a \"fake\" daughter or son? Please.", "This, OP go be happy", "At 17 I was a bit of a dick.  My maturity level at 17 was seeing how many chicken wings I could eat at one sitting.", "This is the way.", "This whole rights thing is quite simple.  It comes down to 1 thing.  \n\nTaxes.  If you pay taxes like me you have the same rights as me.  Period.", "The 16/17yo boys I know now seem to be a lot less bigoted than the ones I grew up with. I think the world might actually be making progress.", "I'm proud to be your first downvote", "It's very clear in the post that OP is dating a MTF trans woman, who is his girlfriend.", "She is not a man, she is a girl", "She chooses who attends. She doesn't get to choose how they react and if they want to go. She wants to act a certain way and insult someone's +1, she has to accept that they will probably be pissed and not want to attend.", "Yeah she can choose whoever she wants to attends. Just like he can choose if he wants to go or not. He didn't ask his family to stand up for him, they choose to pick side not him. Why is he TA? Because he doesn't want to go? You're delusional...", ">If she doesnt want your partner there that's her choice.\n\nAnd if OP doesn't want to attend that's his choice.\n\n>she chooses who attends not you\n\nShe chooses who gets an invitation. The invitees choose wether to accept that initation, not her.", "The sister is the one who made the scene. She decided she doesn't want his GF there for some arbitrary reason (I mean how does it affect her in any way?). Fine, she wants to be a bitxh, its her choice. So, the brother can choose not to go, which he did. So far, no scene. Just two people who cannot agree. \n\nShe could have just left it there. But, no. She is the one getting the whole family involved, making a fuss and dividing everyone. She is absolutely the AH.

You can't compare.", "I mean, it's anyone's right to do what they want. But they can't expect that everyone will fall in line. Just because it's your right doesn't make the right thing to do.", "Ignore them bro,  they're just malding about you being a decent human being.", "Depends on the value of the gift IMO.  I'd throw out a $50 wedding present out of spite.  Over $100 and I'm finding the receipt.", "Store it was bought from may not have a return policy on items, or this specific item was nonreturnable, or it was homemade, or it wasn\u2019t that expensive of a gift and not worth the effort of returning", "\"Neither did the groom\"\n\nOh man.  What a hoot.  Did the groom ever marry her, or did he realize how close he came to that bullet that he dodged?", "No one has a right to be discriminatory. They have a want to be. And when they pay for their wants themselves, it makes racism and bigotry and being a bad person, okay.", "So... she'd rather have a gay brother and his boyfriend at her wedding rather than a brother and his girlfriend who no one else will know is trans unless she makes a big deal of it. Interesting.", "You supported your sister and maintained the relationship. You supported her attitude and behavior and she stepped out of line", "Sure she can, but then there are consequences, i.e. other people get to decide that they\u2019d rather not hang out with a vile transphobe. For every action, there is a reaction.", "Thankfully, he didn't marry her. I would have ended the friendship if he did. They talked months before the wedding, and racism was a huge dealbreaker for him. \n\nHe's doing well. He married an awesome woman right before the pandemic. They just had their 2nd child.", "You DO have a right to be discriminatory in your private life. It can't affect your worklife but you absolutely 100% have the right to choose who you hang out with for whatever reason you want. If you only want to socialize with white people, you can do that. If you don't want to invite any Jewish people to your birthday party, you can do that.", "Something tells me she also wouldn't like the gay scenario either.", "I\u2019m glad your buddy realized what kind of person he dodged the bullet with.", "Exactly. I'm Jewish. If someone excludes me from their birthday party because of that, it's their right. And it's also my right to call them an asshole for doing it."]}
