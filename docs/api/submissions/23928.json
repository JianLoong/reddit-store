If someone is going to talk about you behind your back, they should be prepared to face consequences of being confronted. \n\nI think her behaviour and reaction to getting confronted is a sign that she\u2019s insecure about your past and current relationship with your ex (since you share a daughter). Regardless, whatever insecurity is there and bad mental health is not your fault. \n\nDon\u2019t let her pull that card, because she certainly didn\u2019t have any care for you when she shared your private news to the people at that event without any consideration to the painful reasons why you wanted it kept quiet.", ">It ruined my friendship with everyone at that party as not one person had the respect for me to ask her to stop.\n\nYou have a rather odd idea of what \"respect\" is.

Also, you don't owe your ex priority updates on the state of your womb out of \"respect\". Unless he fathered the child, he finds out when everyone else finds out.", "NTA \n\nWow that's rich.
