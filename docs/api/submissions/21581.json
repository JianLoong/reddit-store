May her memory be a blessing to you. \nRe: your sisters, your wedding, your list. They will not all of a sudden change into the sisters you deserve. If anything they will feel emboldened. Hell, next they\u2019ll expect to be bridesmaids. \nMazel Tov, enjoy your day!", "NTA.  Your parents are right, you should only invite people that love and support you.  I have 7 siblings and only invited one to my wedding.  I do not regret that decision.", "The sisters already badmouth OP and destroyed OPs chance to develop a relationship with a sister-in-law before it even had a chance of being good. They might amp that up, but they might do that even if they were invited to the wedding.\n\nFrom the sounds, being iced out by the sisters and excluded from their lives might be a bonus for OP, not a drawback.\n\nOthers in the family might support the sisters and do some of the same stuff. But there, I think it's notable that OPs mom supports the lack of invites. Plus those sisters also have bad relationships with two other siblings. So it is not like the family does not know them for who they are.\n\nAnyone that does start supporting those sisters will just be showing that it may be time for OP to put some distance from them also. Maybe a little ugly in the short run. But in the long run, again it may be to the good.", "What in the world does that have to do with the question asked?

I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nWhen shit hits the fan, just ask them why they want to come if you're such an awful person. \n\nThey stuck their noses where it didn't belong.

A couple of my wife's siblings are like that as well as her mother, who is a complete and total narcissist.  (Went no contact with all of them eventually.)

You don't need the extra bs on a normal day, let alone on your wedding day.", "NTA. Do t invite them. They are negative energy that will permeate your wedding and life. They will find a way to hurt you more. Say bye to them. No contact is warranted.", "No, baby, stop thinking of those AHs and plan your wedding  enjoy everything and look forward to becoming a \"MRS\".
