Thank you to all who have answered so far. You've provided valuable insight.\n\nObligatory am on mobile, sorry for formatting, and throwaway cause idk who in the family is on reddit and my normal username is well known to a be a nickname.\n\nMy (34 M) partner (28 M) told me this morning that while he was arriving at work yesterday, his mother called and wanted to know if we'd be coming to their cookout this Sunday. He said no, before getting input from me (I'm not upset about it and feel like he did the right thing - see below). We are now being painted as the assholes who don't ever want to be around them.\n\nNow, for some context on these events. I work 3rd shift and we are often given no details until a few days beforehand, leaving me no time to ask for time off work (getting my schedule covered by another employee is out of the question, we have tried that already), and the events always seem to be planned to take place during the hours I find myself sleeping normally, and always after I've worked a full shift prior (we're expected to arrive around 11 am and be present until at least 5 pm). They live about 5 minutes away so it's not a long drive, I just feel it's unreasonable to be expected to stay awake for 24 hours. We've asked them to take my schedule into account but \"9 am is too early to expect us to be awake\" and \"if you get there at 5 there's no point, everyone else will be gone.\" \n\nThe last time we went to one of these gatherings was Christmas, during which I fell asleep on the couch and then was told I \"ruined the entire day\" and because of me, my MIL would never be having another family gathering. \n\nSo, we assumed nothing would be happening for Easter this Sunday. We made our own plans. So when she called yesterday telling us \"Lunch is at 11\" we told her we weren't coming. Now she's upset, and FIL is pissed and wants us to call and apologize. I think we should stand our ground, as I frankly feel it's disrespectful that after several years of asking them to compromise with our schedules as independant adults with our own lives and responsibilities, they still won't.\n\nSo, Reddit, are we the assholes?\n\nETA: I should state I am fairly rigid about when I go to sleep and when I wake up even on my days off in order to maintain a daily rhythm so I'm not falling asleep mid-shift come \"Monday\" (as in the day I go back to work from having 2 days off, not actual Monday) night. I usually go to bed at about 10 am after arriving home around 8 am. I wake up at 4 pm so that I can take care of tasks that MUST be done during business hours such as going to the bank, doctors appointments, etc.\n\nETA 2: Spelling, clarification", "created_utc": 1680963452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fnge2/aita_told_mil_were_not_coming_for_easter_sunday/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And yes, anyone who expects you to stay up for 24 hours just to attend a family function is an AH and doesn't GAF about you, your schedule, or your life.\n\nBoundaries are important. Sometimes parents have problems coming to terms with their children enforcing boundaries, but it's always a bad idea to cave in to their wishes. Don't go. Tell them that next time you'll need at least a week notice before a family event, and if they can't handle it, they can expect not to see you.", "NTA at all.

First of all, you have the right to turn down any invitation you want - you are independent human beings, not servants. \n\nSecond, you have your own life and your own schedule and it sounds like your work schedule is grueling.

It sounds like the holidays are all about them and the vision in their head of the \u201cperfect holiday\u201d instead of making something enjoyable for the people involved. \n\nAnd your MIL is a drama queen. \n\nYou did no wrong turning them down, even without  your work schedule. And, if you not being there is ruining the holiday, then that is a problem of their planning and expectations. \n\nI also have a problem with people issuing a summons to gatherings with things like \u201clunch is at 11\u201d instead of asking if the people can attend. They do not have the right to order you around, and perhaps they need you to turn them down a few times until they learn to ask you respectfully.", "NTA\n\nYou were given a last minute invitation and can't change your work schedule, which they didn't attempt to accommodate at all.\n\nAlso, neither you nor your husband owe any of them an apology.

A big bouquet of flowers is genius because it sort of HAS to be displayed.

They don\u2019t care about your needs or trying to be accommodating so that you and your partner can happily attend.  They are doing everything to try to break you.  They want what they want and they expect you to comply, as if you were minor children being given a command.  When you don\u2019t do what they wanted, they treat you like disobedient children.\n\nYou can\u2019t reason with unreasonable people because they are unreasonable.  Their very nature is to control and expect submission to their desires regardless of your circumstances.\n\nIf their goal was to have a happy family gathering, they would want to accommodate people\u2019s needs.  They don\u2019t.  They want control.  They are having an event at the time they want and you are supposed to attend at their desired time and if you can\u2019t, you are being disrespectful and disobedient.  That\u2019s the very definition of being unreasonable.\n\nSo, enjoy your peaceful Easter\u2026 and be ok with saying no when they are unreasonable.", "NTA. The fact your FIL wants you to apologise to MIL is absurd. They are not entitled to your time; time with family should be cherished, not an expectation. Good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA.  With your work hours they should know if they want you there to plan breakfast or dinner events.  Otherwise you are asleep and they are assholes for expecting otherwise.

He comes away looking like a kicked puppy every time he's left to a conversation with her on his own. I've seen him on the phone with her, arguing with things she's saying about me, that he doesn't relay to me. I am aware that he's shielding me but it's very hard not to feel like an asshole with her using me to get to him. And I don't think it'd be different with any other partner, either - I'm positive she'd act the same way toward anyone he brought home because I honestly don't think it's about me. I'm just a tool for her to use to hurt him.", "Well that\u2019s probably a good thing. They can read the numerous responses about what huge AH\u2019s they are.

I know deep down that I'm not, but sometimes it's hard not to feel like an asshole when I can see how torn he is between being happy with me, and avoiding the conflict by going back home.\n\nI don't think it would be different if it was anyone else, either, male or female or anything in between. I've never met anyone so overbearing.... And I thought *my* folks were bad.", "NTA. We have a lot of 2nd and 3rd shifters in my family and we always do family dinner at 6 or 7pm to allow for them to still get sleep.

You shouldn\u2019t be expected to be anywhere or do anything when you\u2019re an adult with your own responsibilities and schedule. And a demanding one at that! You and your partner have every right to decline and have other plans. \n\nYour IL family has a problem with you specifically. It\u2019s not the timing or the event. It seems like it\u2019s you. \n\nMaybe, next \u201cevent\u201d, whatever holiday comes next for you and your family, request the day off way in advance and plan to be there regardless? I know your rigid about your schedule but maybe there\u2019s a way to bridge the gap between you and your ILs at least for your partners sake. Is that opening the door for them to expect you to do that all the time, sure. But maybe there is a way to have a conversation with them and say \u201chere is what I can do\u201d just so it\u2019s not a complete \u201cshock\u201d to them when you decline the \u201cinvitation\u201d if you can even call it that.

I highly recommend it.", "Your inlaws are incredibly inconsiderate. They could compromise by shifting earlier or later, but nah, you can just stay up for 24 hours and screw up your sleep schedule.", "ESH\n\nThey don't have to change family events at times that are normal just for you.

It\u2019s been three years of us running this business, and nearly a decade of being together and never really wanting to go to every family event on his side OR mine, and only this past year has it finally clicked for her.
