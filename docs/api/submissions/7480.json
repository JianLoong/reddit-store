I don't know him very well or his interests. They have been dating less than a year. I wrote him a check for $100 and a card saying I'm excited that he is joining the family and looking forward to getting to know him better.\n\nThe next day my daughter and I were chatting and she asked if I didn't like her fiance. I said I did. She said it hurt her feelings that I just gave him a check when I gave her brother's boyfriend an expensive subscription to a cheese of the month club for his birthday a few months ago and they aren't even engaged. She said it felt like I was expressing disapproval.\n\nI told her that marriage and engagement aren't the only important relationship statuses. Her brother and his boyfriend have been together for almost five years and live together. I know him really well and know he loves food and would like the cheese of the month club. I didn't know what her fiance would like. Nothing really stuck out to be as a good idea like the cheese club.\n\nShe said it felt like and looked like a lack of effort. I apologized, but I'm still not sure I was really wrong. $100 is hardly a terrible birthday gift. I'm sure by next year I'll know him better and get him something more personal.

Even so, she shouldn't make you out to look like you've done something wrong. It sounds like you wrote a nice note with the card and they're taking this out of context. \n\nAlso, I can't imagine being so rude to complain about a $100 gift. He can buy a lot of cheese with that.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter just doesn't want to admit that her fianc\u00e9 hasn't been around that long.\n\n(How old is she? They've only been together for less than a year and already engaged?!?!? That's a recipe for disaster.)\n\n----\n\nEdit: I'm getting a lot of people claiming that you can have a successful marriage after only knowing someone a short amount of time. This is true, but the amount of time you knew someone before marriage does correlate to a likelihood of divorce. <1 year is by far the most likely to divorce.^[[1]](https://randalolson.com/2014/10/10/what-makes-for-a-stable-marriage/) Another article claims that 2 years of knowing someone is the sweet spot, and more than 4 years leads to more issues.^[[2]](https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/do-marriages-last-longer-if-the-couple-dated-longer-first.html)\n\nI am truly happy that your marriage is healthy and going strong, even though you got married quickly. As a divorced man, I'm actually envious. But that's all anecdotal evidence. Get married quickly increases the chance of divorce.", "NTA. Money is *always* a good gift, especially for someone you barely know. They can use it to get something they will actually like and use. \n\nLike you said\u2026in time, you will get to know him better and probably get him something more personalized.", "NTA\n\nYou tried your best. It's not up to you to search around for a gift for someone you barely know. God knows the fianc\u00e9 probably doesn't put in the same effort back for you. Plus your gift was very generous with a very kind note.\n\nIf your daughter is upset, suggest that you all need to spend more time together. But she can't assume your relationship with her fianc\u00e9 is the same as one you've had with someone for 5 years.", "You're NTA. It blows my mind when people complain about receiving a generous cash gift, as if you did not take enough trouble since it only takes you a moment to write a check. They forget entirely the time it takes you to earn the money you just gave them in a tax free manner. They're both being ungrateful and the only thing you did wrong was apologize.", "NTA. $100 Is a large sum for someone you haven\u2019t gotten to know yet. It\u2019d actually be a large sum for a gift even if you did.", "NTA. Your gift wasn't cheap, and the note expressed that you care...", "NTA - At least you gave him a gift.  They've been dating less that a year so I could see how it would be hard to get him something personal.", "NTA\n\nI can see why she may have felt the way she did, but your explanation was more than reasonable, and should have cleared it up with her.  I don't think that you even owed anyone an apology.", "NTA. They have been dating less then a year! I bet the daughter probably still learning new things about her partner. It\u2019s has even been that long yet and she expects you know more about him?! You were perfect reasonable.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s so strange to me when people feel the need to benchmark other people\u2019s gifts. Like, do you never see something that would be perfect for one person but scratch your head when it comes to someone else? Not everything is so calculated all the time. \n\nWhen you barely know someone?! $100 is generous.\n\nEdit for info: what did you get son\u2019s boyfriend in Year 1? Because that\u2019s a more appropriate point of comparison than year 5.", "Gonna go with NTA as yes it's not a personalised gift but as you've said you don't know this person and $100 is a pretty big sum for a birthday present for an adult person you don't know.", "NTA your daughter is TA", "INFO: What did your daughter's fiance get you for your birthday?", "NTA. A grown man that complains that the other guy got a better gift does not have the maturity needed to be engaged. You shouldn't even expect anything more than a card or handshake.", "NTA and she sounds kind of ungrateful really.  Once I became an adult I pretty much stopped getting birthday presents, I get a card and a phone call singing happy birthday to me (which I'm perfectly fine with!.  I don't recall my parents ever getting my husband anything either.  Not because they didn't care, just because we are adults and it wasn't that big a deal.  I think you make fine points as to why you gave him $100 and I see absolutely nothing wrong with this.", "NTA\n\nYour reasoning is sound: you don\u2019t know him very well, so you gave him money rather than something specific. If your daughter is seeming to hold a grudge over this, she might be projecting. Maybe she\u2019s insecure/worried about your feelings of the relationship. Either way, I think the next step should be to make a little more of a noticeable effort to get to know him and include him, to ensure your daughter will never have this doubt again!", "NTA.  Checks are pretty impersonal, but you hardly know this person.  As for \"equal value\", that is ridiculous.  Most people I know will spend a little extra to get someone something they know they will like, but unless you spent thousands for the cheese, it sounds like the gifts were on the same order of magnitude.  Your daughter is an AH though.  Does she go through your accounts to find out how much cheese costs?", "NTA, but for the next gift event ask your daughter for ideas. I gave my future SiL an uber eats gift card because that's what she and him mom said he would like the best. My other future SiL got a bartenders kit because that was interest and what my daughter suggested.", "NTA.  It's your money, she doesn't get to tell you how to spend it.  Life is not a dollar amount transaction and shouldn't be treated like one.", "NTA and agree with the others that she sounds like a little bit of an ingrate. If you like the guy and they are getting married then you will get to know him better just as you said.", "NTA I bet the guy was happy af with $100 I know I would be, n I'm not even american!", "NTA you didn't have to give him anything and 100$ is not a cheap gift especially not in this economy she sounds very entitled and ungrateful", "NTA that was a generous gift. You can get him a more personal gift once you get to know him. \n\nThey haven\u2019t even been together long at all. For most people, building a relationship takes time. She shouldn\u2019t try to compare your connection to your son\u2019s boyfriend who you\u2019ve been able to get to know for several years. Fianc\u00e9 status doesn\u2019t mean everyone is going to rush to catch up in knowing the fianc\u00e9 the same way as your son\u2019s boyfriend. Not everyone moves as fast as she does. She needs to let others take time.", "I can understand why she asked, and I think that you are NTA. You apologized, and explained in a completely reasonable way. Is she still salty about this seems kinda over the top of so.", "INFO: why didn't you just ask your daughter what her fiance would like?", "NTA.\n\nPeople are weird with cash gifts.  I love them.  I can do what I want with it.  Some people see cash as tacky.  \n\nI mean, maybe it could've been an Amazon gift card or something, but I still think that is essentially the same. \n\nYou have a closer relationship and know your son's boyfriend more.  \n\nYour daughter needs to stop comparing gifts that people received.  No good comes from that.", "NTA\n\n\nJFC since when did a $100 cheque become an insult???\n\n\nMoving forward, I'd tell her to pick his gifts if she's that insulted by cash. $100 limit (which honestly I think is quite high, but you've set the expectation now!), please let you know within a month of his birthday/Christmas what gift would be acceptable and you'll arrange it.", "NTA you could have simply asked him or your daughter what he liked but your Definitely N T A you litterly gave  him a 100 bucks", "NAH\n\nYour daughter is making a false equivalency by expecting you to show the same level of intimacy with her fianc\u00e9 as with her brother\u2019s bf. You\u2019ve known the bf for five years, the fianc\u00e9 for less than a year. \n\nThat said, you gave an extremely low effort gift to the fianc\u00e9. You simply wrote a check. No thought (other than amount) or advanced planning went into it. Even a gift card would have been preferable as that would reflect some awareness of the bf\u2019s spending preferences or required you to ask. The amount ($100) is also likely significantly less than a cheese of the month club. Had you gone with a gift card, that difference wouldn\u2019t have been so obvious.\n\nYou haven\u2019t really provided enough info for me to give any kind of AH judgement. Other than you may not be most thoughtful gift giver to a future family member. It\u2019s not clear *why* you don\u2019t know the fianc\u00e9. Knowing that could change the judgment one way or the other depending on whether you haven\u2019t tried to meet him or if your daughter hasn\u2019t facilitated that.", "Info- why didn\u2019t you ask your daughter what kind of things he likes?", "NAH. I understand that you wanted to get him something but you didn\u2019t know what he would want. However cash is a really impersonal gift. I understand why your daughter was hurt. At this point, the longevity of the relationship is irrelevant. This guy is going to be your SIL. If you didn\u2019t know what he wanted, you could have just picked up the phone and asked her. I just did this for my future BIL at Christmas. I wanted to get him a gift to welcome him into the family but I didn\u2019t know what to get so I discussed it with my sister.", "NTA as long as you actually didn't have any better gift", "I'm gonna say NAH. \n\nI don't want to call you an AH, but I think your daughter has a fair point that it doesn't look great for you to give your son's boyfriend a thought-out gift and her fiance a check. I also agree with you that label (fiance vs boyfriend) doesn't dictate what level of gift is appropriate. \n\nI wish there was another verdict option for someone who's not an AH, but handled a situation poorly, like YTD (dumbass). Situation could have been avoided by asking \"I want to get your fiance a gift, what does he like?\" But you still made the effort to give him a gift, so you're not totally in the wrong.", "Look, I do think it was on you to make more of an effort with someone your daughter is engaged to and should be part of the family for a long long time. If they haven\u2019t been engaged long and you haven\u2019t met many times to gauge his interests, contacting your daughter for advice would have been good.\n\nI also don\u2019t think gifts have to be the same value but closer would have also been more sensible. Those fancy cheese subscriptions are $20+ per month, and I\u2019m assuming you got a year? So a minimum of $240, maybe more. More than double the value of a fianc\u00e9 does come across (to your daughter) as caring less. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, but I do think this was mishandled and I can see why your daughter might interpret this as you not caring or liking her fianc\u00e9. Perhaps also take the two of them on a meal out somewhere fancy to \u2018get to know him better\u2019?", "I personally hate checks for born today gifts. They are just far too impersonal, especially for in person gifting. I 100% think you should have at least asked your daughter for an idea for a gift card for her fianc\u00e9. So I agree with your daughter at that level. \n\nBut, your daughter has been with this guy less than a year and is comparing the birthday money to a gift you gave a long term partner a few months ago. That\u2019s bullshit. A \u201cbetter\u201d gift isn\u2019t always a sign that you like someone more. It can also be a sign you know someone more. \n\nAs long as you make an effort to get to know this dude and his next gift is better (actually personal) then you\u2019re NTA. \n\nI think your daughter\u2019s freak out is a sign of her own insecurities about her relationship moving so fast.", "NTA", "NTA", "I say NAH, cause she kinda has a point.

Being engaged doesn\u2019t mean you have to get married immediately.", "I agree, my fianc\u00e9 and I were only together for 4 months before we got engaged, BUT we have known each other our entire lives, and we\u2019re in our 30\u2019s. The odds are not in favor of the daughter and her fianc\u00e9 unfortunately, despite wishing them the best of luck", "For my 20th birthday, my future MIL called my fiance to tell her that she and her father would not be attending the wedding. I'd of taken $5 instead."]}
