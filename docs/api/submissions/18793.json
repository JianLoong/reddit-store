Ideally, you'd have said something but realistically she isn't going to let you take the baby to your place for a couple of days after birth (plus presumably she's breastfeeding) so really she to be the one who figured out what she thought she might need.

You are only a family via your child and living together can make lines messy.\n\nThat said, I think you should be asking her how you can help and it sounds like you haven't. Not that you aren't helping- it sounds like you are coming over- before and after work but it's not the same as having someone there, taking turns during the night when the baby doesn't need to be fed or bringing the baby to you so you don't have to get up.\n\nOr asking your boss if you can take some paternity leave now. Suggest something like a week to your ex-. Acknowledge that you wish it could be more but that to help her financially with the baby this year, it isn't financially feasible. But even a week will help her get used to the baby's schedule. (It'll also help you see what being with the baby all day is actually like. And that's when there are 2 of you.)\n\nAnd it gives you two a chance to make a better plan. For how you can support her during the next year of no sleep and cluster feedings and exploding diapers.

I'm not going to be able to help you with anything. Now it's possible you'd lose your job then. since you're not married I don't think you would get paternity leave anyway but you could have maybe arranged to take a week off without pay if you had no time. I'm sure they would have let you do that since you're a first time father.

In my state (USA) the parent pays it to the state treasury, who then pays it out to the parent with main/sole custody. I'm getting the impression that your relationship with your ex is a bit messy, as can sometimes happen with breakups, so this can also help protect the both of you if communication breaks down at any point in time. While you're there, you can also get custody set up which again, may not seem necessary but can be a godsend if or when things get complicated.\n\nOn the other hand, she's overwhelmed and it looks like her parents are no help here.
