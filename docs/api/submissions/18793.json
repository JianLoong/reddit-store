We broke up before we knew thaf she was pregnant.\nThe weekend my child was born was a long weekend and i returned to work on the tuesday. I was with her in the hospital from the saturday morning to the tuesday morning doing whatever i could to help her.\nShe is now very mad at me saying i should have taken the week off to help out with the baby and that she feels unsupported. She says that she can't have a shower, make breakfast etc because she has to look after the baby. She is staying at her parents house aswell so she isn't alobe all day.\nWhy i didn't take any time off is because i had just started a new job in january and at the time i didn't know if i was going to be involved in my childs life. It then got to a point where it was too close to the birth date to really organise any time off. Plus my ex is taking a year off with half pay in which she says she'll only get $20,000 so i need to keep my job and keep working to financially support my child.\nI help out when i'm finished and before work with whatever i can, but right now the baby is feeding for almost the whole night and she is exhausted.\nAITA for returning to work?\n\nEDIT: thanks all for your posts and opinions. To clarify some things I decided right from the beginning that i wanted to be involved in my childs life. When i knew that she wanted me involved i didn't have enough time time to give adequate notice to get time off, my work requires at least a month. I do have  the week of the 18th of june, that's the best i could do.\n\nEdit 2: thanks everyone for your input, this has been the most responses i've gotten on a post. Reading all the responses it's validated that i did drop the ball on this one. Regardless of what she was telling me i should have organised time off. I love my son and want to be there for him even if it means supporting my ex financially while she's on maternity leave. I'm not off doing my own thing after work, i feed her horses and get anything she needs, feed my cat and then go help her at her house with our son. I stay up to settle him after she feeds. Again thanks for all the responses, i did drop the ball but i've learned from it.", "created_utc": 1685723072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yh9nh/aita_for_returning_to_work_right_after_my_child/", "score": 3125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Suggest something like a week to your ex-. Acknowledge that you wish it could be more but that to help her financially with the baby this year, it isn't financially feasible.

You're not her boyfriend, so decisions about whether you take time off from work don't need to be made jointly. Part of her feelings about this are probably due to her being overwhelmed, hangry, sleep-deprived, and feeling upset that she needs to ask for help, because it's very strange that her parents aren't helping her out so much more, at least during these first few months.\n\nBut she'll figure things out.\n\nReassure her by stopping by every day after work for the first 6 weeks or so. Give her half an hour a day (or an hour and a half if she asks) to count on. Give her some stability, so she will not feel so alone and can make a plan to get something done during that time. Maybe bring her tomorrow's breakfast (like breakfast burritos, fruit, whatever can be put in her fridge) when you come over, so she doesn't have anxiety about going hungry if she's up all night or if tomorrow gets out of control. Don't call her, but pick up your phone when she calls you so she comes to trust that you're available/reachable if there was ever a serious emergency. Check in on her emotions about her about feeling overwhelmed, fatigued, frustrated, and depressed; it will help her if she can verbalize those feelings and not feel bad for talking about it to you. Be dependable.\n\nAfter 6 weeks, she'll figure out how to take care of herself without needing help from you.\n\nDon't stop coming over too abruptly. Start weaning her off of depending on you as much by coming every other day, then every 2 to 4 days, then every 4 to 6 days, then every 8 to 10 days, etc until you reach whatever is comfortable for the long term for your responsibilities as a dad. A little bit less predictable for her, but more flexible for you.\n\nIf you guys want to get back together, delay it, because she should feel like things will be okay whether you get back together or not.

You do not need to support her though, if she's going to be petty with you. E: Do what your employer can let you do right now, and work through them to be there for your child. You might want to start documenting what mother of your child is saying and doing.", "NTA and I think a lot of people here are from a very privileged economic background. The mother has help with her family while this father is at work. And the parents are not romantically involved anymore. You should totally go everyday after work to bond with your child. The mother can make use of that time to shower or whatever. You should also do laundry, dishes, empty diaper pails, restock baby supplies, bring groceries, and probably some dinner. Offer to take overnight bottle feedings and diaper changes some nights if you\u2019re comfortable staying there. The beginning of being parents is intense and she\u2019s probably feeling frustration about it, but l will be honest it\u2019s not really easier with both parents there. It\u2019s still crazy hard.

It sounds like you are helping as much as you can while working.  She has family and friends who can help her. That's what I did after my husband went back to work after my c-section. Reality is that someone has to make money. She knew she waited too late for you to ask off right away.", "NTA unfortunately that's just how it goes sometimes. I gave birth on a Tuesday and my bf had to be at work on Friday bc we had no income if he didn't work (besides my savings which would cover my half of rent and some bills). as long as you're there when you can be that's what matters. maybe bring her some pre-made food to heat up while you're working, that was a huge help for me when I was home with my son", "Nta", "If you broke up before you knew she was pregnant it's probably not even your kid, she probably got pregnant to a rebound and now wants you to be part of the babies life for financial gain as well as free babysitting.\nNTA and do not trust her or that the kid is even yours", "NTA.

You cannot afford to lose your job now, you have to support her and your child. And as far as i can see you are doing your best for them in your off work time.\n\nHowever, she is NTA as well.

You aren't her live in partner. Even as a single parent that's an unreasonable expectation to me.

You\u2019ve got a child to support now and can\u2019t afford to take a lot of time off if you won\u2019t be paid for it.  Plus, it sounds like she hadn\u2019t decided if she was going to allow you to even be involved in your baby\u2019s life until the last minute, so how exactly were you supposed to know you needed to request the time off?  It sounds like you\u2019re really helping out a lot before & after work, so I wouldn\u2019t say you dropped the ball at all.  Give yourself a break; it sounds like the last 9 months have been complicated.  Congrats on the baby!!\n\nOn a side note.  Not sure how things work where you live, but in Ohio if you\u2019re not married, a father has no rights until he establishes paternity and obtains a Court Order granting him custody, shared parenting, or parenting time.
