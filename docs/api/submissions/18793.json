A lot of jobs require you to work X amount of time before you get leave/vacation. If she is going to take a year off, you have to work so you can get the child the things it needs. Can her parents not watch the baby for a few minutes so she can shower or grab some food? Sure, it would be great if you could take some time off, but many companies in the US don't have paid parental leave and you don't qualify for FMLA yet.", "Nta\n\nI wanted my husband to return right away because my job had unpaid maternity leave. \n\nSacrifices has to be made. At least she has the opportunity to take a year off . Even just half pay\n\nYou can still help when you\u2019re off work. It isn\u2019t like you will be at work 24 hours", "INFO: why on earth didn\u2019t you know if you were going to be involved in your child\u2019s life? And do you have time off you could have taken if you\u2019d gotten organized to do so in time?", "NTA but y\u2019all need to step up the communication by a lot in order to co parent this human", "If you were a couple, you would be. But you're not so I don't see anything wrong with it. NTA", "NAH. \n\nExpectations need to be communicated better.", "NTA. It sounds like there wasn't much planning leading up to this. She's just angry because she's exhausted and overwhelmed. And dude, I don't wanna sound cold- hearted, but I'd arrange for a paternity test if I were you. Just to be sure that child is yours. Who's to say she didn't have some rebound/revenge fling right after you broke up? I don't know what the family laws are in your state/country, but you may want to seek the advice of a good family attorney who can guide you in what your rights are and what your obligations are. Best of luck to you.", "INFO: do you plan to actually be a father to this child or just to support the child and its mother financially? Did the mother go into the birth with the expectation you'd be helping her beyond just paying child support? What's the arrangement you two have?", "NTA. You two are broken up and she lives with others who should be helping her. While returning to work isn't usually out of the question for the parent who didn't give birth, a new mother is so taxed and recovering and learning how to be a parent. So, she might be a bit grumpy with you while her faculties are spread thin, especially that you are no longer a couple, so just try to not take it personally and be helpful when not at work. Congrats on parenthood!", "NTA. And congratulations! :) \n\nYou're doing what you can. Just remember to be there for your child and bond with him/her when you can. That is the most important thing. \n\nObviously you guys should have communicated better in advance, around expectations etc. But it is what it is now. So just keep doing the best you can. \n\nBtw, She can make breakfast and shower. Trust me. It's just daunting the first time, because you think the kid will die or something in those few minutes your in the shower. I assume she has a baby carrier. Have the kid in that. Same with breakfast. She'll be fine. But make these suggestions to her, gently I may add, hormones are running high right now. (Granted I got shampoo in my eye first time, because I was so fixated on my kid, lol, but we both made it. The eye too)\n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA Gotta work, thems the breaks.", "Did you two discuss this?", "NTA. You are doing what you must be doing giving the circumstances: provide. If you lose your job, you would not be able to provide. It\u2019s unfortunately that she cannot get all the support she need, but you are doing your best.", "You didn't say you tried to get a week off for being father of newborn. Did you even try? Because the way you wrote it sounds like you didn't even try.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA how is she going to mange all those things after you\u2019ve returned to work after your week off? Is she not planning to shower then or eat. Christ, we\u2019re not hopeless and newborns sleep a lot.", "ESH, but especially you. Responsibility should have been sorted out before the baby was born. Be a man and take care of your kid.", "NTA and I know Reddit skews younger, but some of you might have a rude awakening when it comes to recognizing just how crappy A LOT of company's parental leave policies are", "Info: does your employer offer any paid or unpaid parental leave? Did you guys talk about your work schedule before the birth so she knew not to expect you there? When you're helping before or after work are you watching the baby? Why can't she shower, etc then?", "nta. can't have her cake and eat it too. How does she expect to have you help support the baby if you have no job and she's taking a year off with half pay? You can help AFTER work, but you need to be earning the $$$ to support your child.", "NTA. You are doing great.", "Are you in the US? Does your job have any paternity leave? If you just started the job a few months ago, I don't think you have to be allowed FMLA. So...if you're risking keeping your job and not getting paid, then you aren't an AH... the biggest AH is the United States and their lack of support for new parents. \n\n\nBut \"I didn't know if I'd be involved in my child's life\"? What was the discussion about this? Had she said when you broke up \"I don't want/not sure I want you around when I give birth or when I'm recovering?\" Because, while you are equally a parent, there is definitely a necessity of the woman recovering, establishing breast feeding if she chooses to, etc.  Was this discussed at all? Lawyers should have been involved already regarding custody in general....but she'd get majority say during the very beginning.  Or was it just not brought up and \"Eh, we'll figure it out\"?", "YTA. \n\nWhile she does has support, it's clear she expects you to step up and support as a parent, especially during that first week. \n\nShe just went through a HUGE bodily event and having a full time co-parent with her for the first week as she physically recovers was not a huge ask.", "NAH. You don't technically owe her anything but whatever child support your country requires. That said, not many new moms really understand the reality of being a single parent until the shit hits the fan.  I'd suggest:\n\n1) Help her get on daycare wait lists. Stay at home mom is hella hard when you're a single mom and she might be happier going back to work.\n\n2) Go over after work as many days a week as you're comfortable with. The first 12-14 weeks really suck. \n\n3) Go with her to the baby's next appointment and find out how soon you can introduce supplemental feeding so you could take the baby for at least one day/night each weekend \n\nBut no, you aren't responsible for changing your job because of a baby you didn't know was coming.", "ESH\n\n- you need to work but working doesn\u2019t give you a get out of jail free card with childcare. Your baby mother is doing double the amount of work as you in terms of childcare AND domestic duties and she\u2019s not being paid.", "YTA for not knowing whether or not you were going to be an involved parent. It's pretty normal to tell new jobs on hiring \"FYI, this is happening in my life, I may need a couple days.\"", "INFO \nDid you ask about paternity leave or did you just assume", "ESH - This was something you guys should\u2019ve clearly discussed and agreed upon before the child was born. No issues with you returning to work so soon, if it\u2019s necessary, but this should\u2019ve been communicated well in advanced. In return, she should\u2019ve made her expectations clear too.", "ESH. \n\nThere should have been clear communication about what the plan and expectations were before she gave birth. \n\nYes she is home and with her parents, but you shouldn't  just expect her parents to help her with your child and act like that solves it.\n\nShe also should have communicated expectations before giving birth about how much help she expected. And yes, if she is expecting money from you- as she should- that means you need to work. \n\nYou both failed here, and just because you aren't together doesn't mean you can expect other people to step in to care for your child, you should be actively communicating with the mother of your child about expectations and needs. And she should be doing the same.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
