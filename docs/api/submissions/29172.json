She\u2019s always been spoiled golden girl in the family and I am the proud eccentric black sheep. Her daughter B (51F) is a year older than me and it\u2019s always been shoved down everyone\u2019s throats how great she was. Her grandkids received the same treatment. \n\nThis happened about five years ago at my aunt\u2019s funeral. She was going on and on about B and her three grandkids. Then suddenly brought up the fact that I was divorced and had raised my five kids on my own and how they were doomed to have peanut jobs in life because they hadn\u2019t attended college like her daughter. \n\nNow I was the mom that when my kids each graduated from middle school, I had sat them down and explained to them that the next four years of school, I wasn\u2019t going to be after them as much about homework or extracurricular activities. If they needed my help with homework or projects, they were to ask me and I\u2019d be there. I\u2019d pay for their fees as needed and make sure they got there on time. But this was pre-adulthood and I felt they needed to start seeing what responsibility meant and that every action in life had a reaction of some kind. A lot of parents including C thought it was just me being a lazy parent. \n\nSo at the funeral, she made the comment about how B had went through community college and graduated. Which was great for her and I\u2019m proud of her accomplishment.  However, C then looks at me and scathingly asks how my kids are fairing in life with a lazy mom like me and oh my OP, didn\u2019t three of them quit high school? \n\nAnd this is where I might be the AH, but I replied that my oldest 30M who had quit school was now a supervisor and third down from the CEO of a T foreign vehicle manufacturer. My 29F  who had also quit school was working in a property management company in Arizona as the personal assistant to the owner, my 23F who\u2019d graduated had just got promoted to business office manager in our local hospital, my 22F who\u2019d quit school had completed trade school for carpentry and was now purchasing, remodeling and flipping houses was already making six figures a year, and my youngest 19M who had graduated was the night manager after three years at the world of Wally. The more I talked, the sourer her face looked. \n\nI then got an innocent look on my face and asked her how B was doing after graduating from college with her associates in forestry. I hadn\u2019t noticed that B had come to join the group until she spoke up and said that hasn\u2019t worked out so well for her and she was driving a bus for a local transportation company. B then asks if my oldest could put in a good word for her to get on with him at the T plant. C then gets up and storms outside. \n\nMy older sister pulled me to the side and said I was an AH for bragging about my kids actually making it good in life. I personally thought I was having a proud mom moment, but am I the AH?", "created_utc": 1697630748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ap5su/aitah_for_bragging_about_my_kids/", "score": 1954, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Oh, lets not forget that C is bragging about B.. a 51 year old, getting a degree at community college.

In my circles, that's not a thing we usually praise. Anyway, NTA for this specific instance where you proudly said what all your kids are up to (although again, where I'm from, 4/5 HS dropouts definitely reflects on the mother) but ESH just because you're all middle aged women engaging in this nonsense", "ESH.

My mom was not, even before she had me at an age that was definitely too young. This filtered down to me for years, as my aunt doted on her child and my mom struggled to get by while grandma judged. Mom never brings my cousin into this, because she knows the kids are off limits for this kind of thing. And believe me, the way things have gone if she wanted to bring him into it there\u2019s plenty there to talk about. \n\nAlso? You stopped paying attention to how your kids did in school because you had five kids and you were exhausted. It wasn\u2019t some kind of ideal parenting choice.", "NTA \n\nYou weren\u2019t nasty.

How wildly inappropriate to get into this kind of nonsense while people are in mourning.\n\nYTA for dragging B into the feud you have with her mother. It\u2019s not her fault that her mom was the favored kid of your generation.\n\nAnd finally YTA to your kids. Teenagers are literally still children and as puberty rampages though their systems, they aren\u2019t able to make the best choices for their futures. That\u2019s what parents are supposed to do - help guide them to make good choices. College is NOT required for everyone but there are going to be jobs and promotions they can\u2019t get without a high school diploma. Even if they get their GED, there are employers who look down on that (which is wrong and they shouldn\u2019t, but this is the world we live in).", "ESH. Honestly, it is always too early to brag about your kids because none of us know what the future holds. One bad decision or stroke of bad luck can turn everything upside down. Just be proud of your kids without trying to us their success and achievements to score points in some petty contest", "YTA. What a bullshit story. Even if your family was actually so warped to engage in such melodramatic Degrassi nonsense, you\u2019re a 50 year old woman. You should not be participating in this. More likely, you\u2019re fabricating details of a story to make yourself as Christlike as possible. Maybe you just made all of this up! I wouldn\u2019t know and I wouldn\u2019t care.

You know what most people say about my life as a stay at home mom/housewife with no career aspirations? \"You're lazy, a golddigger, that's so boring and unfulfilling, I could never, you don't have any other dreams? you don't want more out of life?\" If they could see the horrors I went through, they'd know exactly why my \"boring, small\" little life of simplicity is more like Heaven to me. I didn't have peace growing up, or creature comforts, or love and affection. So if I can foster that now in my own home, with my husband and children, you bet your ass I'm going to. You don't know somebody's life story. I'm not a doctor or anybody who's going to change the world. But I'm still HERE. I'm getting through the days and my kids will never know the kind of terrible things I knew by the time I was 5. So mind your own business and let people be happy as they are. The manager down at Walmart may be doing LEGIONS better in life than they ever had growing up, and yet you think you have the right to look down on anyone who's proud of them for it. Who are you to judge that??", "Or not - sounds like you enjoy being a miserable ****", "The 19 year old would appear to be the overnight Walmart employee", "That\u2019s the kid who did graduate.", "It really depends! Job titles can mean wildly different things in different companies. \"Office manager\" is how some companies refer to the admin/secretary because secretary as a job title has some devaluing undertones, so if that's how they're using the title, then office manager kiddo does stuff like stock the office supplies and break room, answer phones, man the front desk, bring in and set up food or treats for work meals, etc. \n\nGood stable work that keeps every office in the world running, and absolutely a job she can take pride in doing, with opportunities to springboard into HR or accounting if she wants to go up the ladder as she progresses, but also a pretty typical first job for a young adult woman entering the workplace with basic qualifications.", "Is that even a job a 23-year-old would have? I'm don\u2019t entirely believing OP here.", "Generation in terms of gen x/z etc is determined by age, but in families a generation is the same row on a family tree afaik", "Oops, my mistake. 22 isn't much better but I guess possible, but having been on the struggle bus before this feels a lot like small exaggerations you tell your family when stuff is not great.", "I\u2019m thinking she\u2019s A supervisor in the billing office of a hospital, as opposed to THE manager of the entire business office, because no, that is not a job that a 23 year old with only a high school diploma would have.", "Yeah. The \u201cmanager of a hospital\u2019s business office\u201d is definitely a supervisor over like two people. The \u201cnight manager at Walmart\u201d is what, supervising the forklift guys overnight? If you\u2019re working overnight at Walmart, you\u2019re not winning. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re one wrung above literal high schoolers. You work overnight at Walmart. Sure, the kids are doing well compared to most high school dropouts, but even with OP\u2019s embellishments, these are far from wunderkinds."]}
