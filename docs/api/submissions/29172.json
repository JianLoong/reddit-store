She\u2019s always been spoiled golden girl in the family and I am the proud eccentric black sheep. Her daughter B (51F) is a year older than me and it\u2019s always been shoved down everyone\u2019s throats how great she was. Her grandkids received the same treatment. \n\nThis happened about five years ago at my aunt\u2019s funeral. She was going on and on about B and her three grandkids. Then suddenly brought up the fact that I was divorced and had raised my five kids on my own and how they were doomed to have peanut jobs in life because they hadn\u2019t attended college like her daughter. \n\nNow I was the mom that when my kids each graduated from middle school, I had sat them down and explained to them that the next four years of school, I wasn\u2019t going to be after them as much about homework or extracurricular activities. If they needed my help with homework or projects, they were to ask me and I\u2019d be there. I\u2019d pay for their fees as needed and make sure they got there on time. But this was pre-adulthood and I felt they needed to start seeing what responsibility meant and that every action in life had a reaction of some kind. A lot of parents including C thought it was just me being a lazy parent. \n\nSo at the funeral, she made the comment about how B had went through community college and graduated. Which was great for her and I\u2019m proud of her accomplishment.  However, C then looks at me and scathingly asks how my kids are fairing in life with a lazy mom like me and oh my OP, didn\u2019t three of them quit high school? \n\nAnd this is where I might be the AH, but I replied that my oldest 30M who had quit school was now a supervisor and third down from the CEO of a T foreign vehicle manufacturer. My 29F  who had also quit school was working in a property management company in Arizona as the personal assistant to the owner, my 23F who\u2019d graduated had just got promoted to business office manager in our local hospital, my 22F who\u2019d quit school had completed trade school for carpentry and was now purchasing, remodeling and flipping houses was already making six figures a year, and my youngest 19M who had graduated was the night manager after three years at the world of Wally. The more I talked, the sourer her face looked. \n\nI then got an innocent look on my face and asked her how B was doing after graduating from college with her associates in forestry. I hadn\u2019t noticed that B had come to join the group until she spoke up and said that hasn\u2019t worked out so well for her and she was driving a bus for a local transportation company. B then asks if my oldest could put in a good word for her to get on with him at the T plant. C then gets up and storms outside. \n\nMy older sister pulled me to the side and said I was an AH for bragging about my kids actually making it good in life. I personally thought I was having a proud mom moment, but am I the AH?", "created_utc": 1697630748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ap5su/aitah_for_bragging_about_my_kids/", "score": 822, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Oh, lets not forget that C is bragging about B.. a 51 year old, getting a degree at community college.

People here are acting like she was talking about a young adult, but nope, she's bragging about her middle-aged daughter. \nAlso, it's interesting that the golden grandchild had a kid at 17 but somehow was still the golden kid. In my circles, that's not a thing we usually praise. Anyway, NTA for this specific instance where you proudly said what all your kids are up to (although again, where I'm from, 4/5 HS dropouts definitely reflects on the mother) but ESH just because you're all middle aged women engaging in this nonsense", "ESH.

My mom was not, even before she had me at an age that was definitely too young. This filtered down to me for years, as my aunt doted on her child and my mom struggled to get by while grandma judged. Mom never brings my cousin into this, because she knows the kids are off limits for this kind of thing. And believe me, the way things have gone if she wanted to bring him into it there\u2019s plenty there to talk about. \n\nAlso? You stopped paying attention to how your kids did in school because you had five kids and you were exhausted. It wasn\u2019t some kind of ideal parenting choice.", "NTA \n\nYou weren\u2019t nasty.

How wildly inappropriate to get into this kind of nonsense while people are in mourning.\n\nYTA for dragging B into the feud you have with her mother. It\u2019s not her fault that her mom was the favored kid of your generation.\n\nAnd finally YTA to your kids. Teenagers are literally still children and as puberty rampages though their systems, they aren\u2019t able to make the best choices for their futures. That\u2019s what parents are supposed to do - help guide them to make good choices. College is NOT required for everyone but there are going to be jobs and promotions they can\u2019t get without a high school diploma. Even if they get their GED, there are employers who look down on that (which is wrong and they shouldn\u2019t, but this is the world we live in).", "ESH. Honestly, it is always too early to brag about your kids because none of us know what the future holds. One bad decision or stroke of bad luck can turn everything upside down. Just be proud of your kids without trying to us their success and achievements to score points in some petty contest", "YTA. What a bullshit story. Even if your family was actually so warped to engage in such melodramatic Degrassi nonsense, you\u2019re a 50 year old woman. You should not be participating in this. More likely, you\u2019re fabricating details of a story to make yourself as Christlike as possible. Maybe you just made all of this up! I wouldn\u2019t know and I wouldn\u2019t care.

I am still my grandparents\u2019 granddaughter and my parents\u2019 daughter no matter how old I get and I\u2019m older than OP! \nI believe OP worded it that way because she was talking about the dynamic that existed between grandparents, herself, her siblings, and the cousins on one side. In other words, the grandchildren.", "If this was a few years ago, why bring it up now? Has it not blown over by now? Did something happen to bring it back to the surface recently?", "Then absolutely NTA because of B was ok with it, then it's all good.", "\"doing fine, do you have their numbers to call them?\"\n\nIts not a competition", "\u201cI\u2019m the black sheep of the family, I openly neglected my children\u2019s developmental needs in high school, and they have managed mediocre careers, yay me!\u201d", "> And don\u2019t talk shit about her kid.\n\nWhere did OP talk shit about her kid?", "Nope. SAT. I did also take the PSAT but my HS paid for it.\n\nFirst time was always intended to be a test run for my cousins. Showed them what they had to work on for a better score. They are a bit rich so money wasn\u2019t an issue.", "I am not a mother and my mother doesn't go after people the way \"mama bear\" types are portrayed.  \n\nHowever a friend of mine 100% has a \"mama bear\" for a mother.   That lady kicks ass, will feed everyone in reach whether they want to pretend to be too proud or not, and has adopted (legally) one of the friends into her family to give them a more stable life.  \n\nThe phrase describes her completely.  I have no other phrase that describes her as well.  \n\nIt's only cringy when normal people that wouldn't fight for their kids and the kids around them use the phrase.", "How are you being up voted his is the cringiest comment I have seen today", "Actually, I'm was my adult kids who called me a paratrooper momma bear, after I explained our basic military training to them. \n\nLame, because the kids love their mom?\nCringey because they wanted to be a bit silly in their young adulthood?\n\nLuckily for me, they are my kids.  Not yours.\nSorry that what my children say in my home to my family members bothers you so much.", "Guaranteed you say shit on the reg that other people find cringe as fuck.\n\nAnd everyone becomes embarrassing as hell once they reach a certain age. If you haven't experienced that yet, just wait. Thankfully, if you've done some growing, you stop giving a shit what other people think of your particular brand of cringe.", "Nah", "Oh my gosh yes!! I am a mom and I find this expression so freaking cringey! Can  we please just all decide that we\u2019re not gonna say this anymore?", "Agree. ESH. Embarrassing all around. Your kids are doing ok, but they're not bringing about world peace or finding the cure for cancer.", "Yeah real momma bears sound a lot more like a person getting their face eaten off by a bear because they got too close to a bear", "I have lots of respect for all the \"momma bear\" types who look after their children, their family, and go the extra mile.  \n\nCall it cringe, but I view that as far more admirable than the dysfunctional parenting that edgy people here seem to prefer.", "100%. The kid flipping houses is doing alright, but the other dropouts are still very much doing high school dropout jobs. Above average high school dropouts are generally still high school dropouts.", "I guess I'm just a stubborn great great great great great grandchild just like my great great great great great grandfather who doesn't see the world that way.", "\"I'm the youngest of my generation in family, C is the oldest one\".", "Jesus, yeah but if someone talks shit about the people you care about most people expect you to defend them. Sooo yta if you just say doing fine imo", "When she listed off her kids\u2019 accomplishments then she asked how the girl was doing \u201cwith her associates in forestry\u201d knowing full well that it wasn\u2019t as well as how she portrayed her own children. It\u2019s mean girl stuff, especially since the other lady\u2019s kid was there and heard it. If they were in private I\u2019d be less judgmental about it, although you still don\u2019t have to bring up the girl\u2019s struggles to be proud of your own kids.", "Yeah, this. I say my mom is literally like a mother bear, partly because she\u2019d have made a good Wonder Woman. Super athletic and just about beat up a Rottweiler in defense of a baby. My grandma helped save someone from a falling tree and my great aunt helped get a car jacked that fell onto somebody. That side of the family is just Intimidating AF despite averaging out around 5\u2019 and I would not want to mess with any of them. I\u2019m bigger/stronger but they bite, okay?", "Cool. How about YOU don't use the term and let others express themselves how they want to when they aren't harming anyone?\n\nPeople are dying, Kim.", "Right?? It just comes off pathetic, lame and embarrassing. Kids are amazing and so are moms. But this phrase needs to die.", "Look, no offense intended, but I personally hate this take.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to cure cancer or bring peace to the Middle East to justify having your mom be proud of you.\n\nOrdinary people doing ordinary things are allowed to be happy, content, and yes, even proud of their ordinary lives and ordinary achievements.\n\nShe can be proud that her kids are healthy, happy, and contributing members of society.  She was set up to be embarrassed about how her kids are doing, and she wasn\u2019t.", "If that's really your bar...\n\nWhat are your kids doing?\n\nI bet you don't have any yet, cuz this reads like a 14 year old desperate to be cool, but what happens if one of your kids happily becomes an accountant? Gonna look down on them cuz they're not curing cancer?\n\nBetter yet, what have YOU accomplished that is worthy of your parents being proud of you? When is your cancer cure or peace treaty dropping?", "So you think you shouldn't care about your child's accomplishments unless they make history? . My parents were proud of me when I got accepted onto my apprenticeship, and when I qualified top grades in my class, and when I got a job earning more than 3 of my parents (my parents are divorced and remarried). Should they have ignored me and told me to \"come back when you make history or are the best in the world\". She was asked how they were doing, what should she have said? Lied about how well they were doing, ignored the question?", "Man, I genuinely hope you are just having a bad day and are not actually such a miserable, joy-sucking person that you would tell a mother who is proud of her children that she sucks and is embarassing for sharing their accomplishments\n\nHope your day gets better", "So what? That doesnt mean a mom shouldnt be proud of her kids.", "Maybe if they weren't at a funeral but this was not the place or time.", "\"Talks shit\"\n\nShes bragging her kid got into college. Again, why the fuck do you get into a dick waving contest at a funeral about your kids.", "The \"girl\" she was bragging about getting her associates degree is 51.", "This might be hard for you to understand, but the whole point of reddit is basically to be a place where people express their OPINION. So if you're going to get offended, I don't get why you're partaking?", "Its like what parents say here in Brazil: n\u00e3o fez mais que a obriga\u00e7\u00e3o. Basically means the achievement doesnt matter bc it was already expected of you.\n\nSuch a horrible way to view kids.", "I needed a way to separate them in the sentence, and the point I was trying to make is that you don\u2019t talk about people that way when they aren\u2019t even the ones who caused you trouble. It\u2019s not exactly easier to hear in your fifties than in your twenties. It can be harder in a lot of ways for summertime to imply you\u2019re a failure, because you have less time to work with if you want to make a change."]}
