She has a negative opinion about everything, but notably, my husband. Most of the time I just brush it off but we\u2019re all at my parents\u2019 for Christmas and her comments have been constant. \n\nExample 1 - She hates that me or my husband refer to him looking after our daughter as \u201cbabysitting\u201d. Unpopular opinion nowadays, but I don\u2019t mind it. We actually *both* use the term for when one of us wants to do a recreational activity and the other has our daughter. I say \u201che\u2019s at golf so I\u2019m babysitting\u201d and he\u2019ll say \u201cshe\u2019s going to dinner so I\u2019m babysitting\u201d. However, Alison is only upset when my husband says it. \n\nExample 2 - She needles him by asking pointed questions that she thinks \u201cany mother would know\u201d and then gets smug when he doesn\u2019t know the answer. \n\nExample 3 - Every time I do anything with my daughter (and I do most things with her around me because that\u2019s what she\u2019s used to) Alison makes comments about me being to be a \u201cmarried single parent\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve told her to stop many times. I\u2019ve told Harvey to stop her many times. Nothing works. My husband and I have an agreement that we don\u2019t fight with the other\u2019s side of the family so I feel bad that I haven\u2019t been able to do anything about Alison\u2019s comments.\n\nThen, two days ago, we were all in the dining room, with the exception of my husband who was finishing up some work. Alison remarked that she hasn\u2019t seen him all day and that it was really rude that he wasn\u2019t putting in more effort to spend time with his daughter or the family. I sternly told her that my husband is working to provide for his family and that not everyone can just take weeks off at a time. Alison then said \u201cof course you\u2019d say that, you\u2019re basically paid to be his bang-nanny\u201d (I\u2019m a SAHM). I cannot remember the last time I was so enraged. Before i could even fully process my own thoughts, I said \u201cYeah, and you get cheated on for free. Tell me who got the better deal\u201d. \n\nFor context, everyone knows about Harvey\u2019s indiscretions, but I guess Alison didn\u2019t know we were aware.\n\nAlison went silent, then left the table. It\u2019s been two days and she hasn\u2019t said a word to me, barely any to anyone else, won\u2019t even make eye contact. Harvey is livid that I brought it up, but I told him he had his chance to make her stop and he didn\u2019t so I did. My dad said she fucked around and found out, my mom said she feels bad because Alison is quite obviously humiliated. I said she earned it from how she was always trying to embarrass my husband, but my mom says it\u2019s different because no one took her seriously.

It sounds like Alison is the kind of unhappy person who takes her pain out on those around them. Of course she attacks your husband.

I read comments on this post only calling SiL a huge massive ah. My opinion still stands. Cheating brother deserves the massaive AH award. I watched a loving caring person change into a spiteful nagging everyone is against me f everyone. Bc they were stuck in a shitty situation. SiL isn't the bad guy here just a byproduct of a shitty husband. She needs therapy tho.", "You don't know that as much as I don't know that. What I do know is she already has a bias against the wife treating her brother negatively and criticising him all the time, which OP clearly disagrees with and all of the examples she cites centred around parenting. Do you all think that's a coincidence?\n\n- the babysitting term example\n- the example where she frames it as the wife making pointed questions about parenting only a mother should know which he fails in getting right. Is there anything a mother should know about their child a father doesn't other than breastfeeding and the actual birth giving part? It truly sounds like he is a backseat parent\n- last example is disdain from the wife to OP about her life as a parent and it sounds like a lot of projection and jealousy. Why would someone be jealous and have an insecurity about parenting if they were in a great parenting relationship?\n\nTake all those bits of information, and then you have a husband who's cheated on top of that. I have seen numerous posts in sub about couples who are friends with another couple and cheating happens in one relationship...When couple A has a cheater and said cheater goes to couples B house to hide out and hang, one faction of couple B is totally ok with it and the other faction is against it. This sub goes into the discussion of, being friends with, hanging out with and accepting and defending a cheater means you're low key a cheater or accepting of cheating. Then they ask why would you continue to be friends with a cheater. I see these concepts and ideas get applied conveniently when people feel like it. \n\nAnd yes, I see OPs \"protection\" of her brother as defending his cheating bc if she was against it, she may have stayed neutral to their interactions and she may not know if resentment had formed due to this cheating. And yes even if a couple stays together after cheating it doesn't mean the forgiving person is wrong for forgiving. What if she forgave and he's continuing to show gratitude by being a shitty parent, which is exactly what it sounds like is happening. If he can't answer questions a mother should know, if he refers to watching his kids as babysitting, if he's cheated on the mother of his child, I'm pretty sure we can strongly say the brother is not a stand-up guy. Who feels bad for a shitty guy, even if they're your brother cheating is crazy bad. I wouldn't necessarily cut off a cheating relative but I wouldn't be going out my way to defend them in any capacity.\n\n\n**At no point have I contested that the wife was right in any way shape or form for what she did, so I don't understand why it seems people believe I have this opinion. If I felt that way I would have put Y T A.** I don't know why people can't separate that and decide to have unjustified biases because they saw an opinion they didn't like. We're all in agreement the wife is an AH right?

AT the end of the day, we\u2019re parents 365 days a year regardless of our word choices. People are just upset by anything these days", "That is true. And to further be fair, there could have been private conversations with the SIL about what she was saying.", "Is \"Hundo P\" = 100%?", "Alison pulled a classic DARVO--she tosses out insult after insult and when someone finally responds, she turns herself into the victim.\n\nAlso, calling someone a \"Bang-Nanny\" is not only highly insulting to you and your husband, but incredibly vulgar for a family dinner table. Is she always so trashy?\n\nYou are NTA. Alison is TA.", "Just let him know Alison doesn't count.", "Agreed! My husband and I have the same rule as well.", "The verbal equivalent of 2014 Godzilla's \"kiss of death\".", "Facts !", "That's the reason - she's just jealous, knowing, she got the short straw and OP's husband seems to be a decent man. So she tries to undermine him, so her own fiasco of a marriage doesn't look so bad. Except it doesn't work.", "Bingo. This is what I think also. The way her Mom is defending SIL, I wonder if her brother is the golden child or is trying to keep that marriage together to see her grandchildren.", ">She\u2019s mad her husband is trash and for some reason hasn\u2019t divorced him.\n\nYup, and she's targetting OP's husband hoping that OP falls for her \"Jedi mind trick\" and becomes miserable as her", "OP has a great husband? Did we read the same post?", ">misogynistic\n\nI couldn't figure out what exactly bothered me so much about the comment but this is it.\n\nWoman works outside the home - \"So you're just gonna let someone else raise your kids?\"\n\nWoman is a SAHM - \"Alright *bang-nanny*\"\n\nWhy are people like this?", "Again, this isn\u2019t how I would handle a situation like this and I explained why. You\u2019re free to have a different opinion. It doesn\u2019t change mine. I\u2019m not going to argue about it.", "Yeah your last point is majorly right. For some reason I didn't read this properly and thought there was a child involved. \n\nOP saying declaring the wife has negative opinions about her brother is a defensive statement though. It literally means she disagrees with the things she says to him. \n\nAnd yeah I know what she called OP. When did I ever say that was right?", "It's because \"babysitting\" is defined as watching someone else's children. And it is a source of contention in families where one parent \"parents\" and the other \"babysits.\"\n\nThat being said, the term works for you and your family. You use it mutually like Babycatcher said above. Sound like you have a great, equitable family dynamic. i.e., who TF cares what term you use if you're okay with it (and obvi not in an abusive fog). \n\nNTA btw, in fact, you sound hilarious and witty", "yeah, she barely knows her abc's! :)", "Totally. It's like she needs to believe OP's life is worse than hers.", "I think the Mom is embarrassed her son is shitty and knows deep down that\u2019s why her DIL is attacking her daughters husband. He may be the golden child but I think they were ignoring it because it wasn\u2019t directly about OP so they let her get away with it for so long and expected OP to not acknowledge the elephant in the room. \n\nDIL got away with it for so long then got bold & extremely nasty with OP and received her comeuppance. Now they can\u2019t ignore how hateful she was being and what they allowed. OP\u2019s mom is embarrassed about her own behavior and her son\u2019s and is trying to place the blame everywhere else. \n\nShe could have pulled her son or the DIL aside and told her to check her behavior.", "I don\u2019t think Mom was really defending her. I get feeling bad for her too even though what she says is shitty & she deserved it.", "Happy cake day Princess B", "Not necessarily the golden child, but Mom may want to keep the peace at Christmas. Plus, this Issue Is daughter and DIL related. No reason for HER to her son into it at this stage. OP yes, but not the mom", "Where did you read he wasn't?", "Yes, I said that in the first line. Reread my comment again.", "Huh. Wild I never noticed that.", "Again, what do you want them to do?? Tie him up? Stay with him 24/7? Put a track app on his phone and monitor him?? Op has her own life, husband and daughter. Why should she add more drama to her life? And for what?? Those two deserve each other, altough i'm willing to cut him some slack cause she's a nightmare.", "Again, I\u2019m not arguing about this. We have different opinions, so what\u2019s the point in going back and forth about it? I\u2019m not going to be able to change your mind and you can\u2019t change mine."]}
