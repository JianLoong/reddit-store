I will be honest, I don\u2019t like Alison. She\u2019s the most negative, bitter person I\u2019ve ever had to spend more than an hour with. She has a negative opinion about everything, but notably, my husband. Most of the time I just brush it off but we\u2019re all at my parents\u2019 for Christmas and her comments have been constant. \n\nExample 1 - She hates that me or my husband refer to him looking after our daughter as \u201cbabysitting\u201d. Unpopular opinion nowadays, but I don\u2019t mind it. We actually *both* use the term for when one of us wants to do a recreational activity and the other has our daughter. I say \u201che\u2019s at golf so I\u2019m babysitting\u201d and he\u2019ll say \u201cshe\u2019s going to dinner so I\u2019m babysitting\u201d. However, Alison is only upset when my husband says it. \n\nExample 2 - She needles him by asking pointed questions that she thinks \u201cany mother would know\u201d and then gets smug when he doesn\u2019t know the answer. \n\nExample 3 - Every time I do anything with my daughter (and I do most things with her around me because that\u2019s what she\u2019s used to) Alison makes comments about me being to be a \u201cmarried single parent\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve told her to stop many times. I\u2019ve told Harvey to stop her many times. Nothing works. My husband and I have an agreement that we don\u2019t fight with the other\u2019s side of the family so I feel bad that I haven\u2019t been able to do anything about Alison\u2019s comments.\n\nThen, two days ago, we were all in the dining room, with the exception of my husband who was finishing up some work. Alison remarked that she hasn\u2019t seen him all day and that it was really rude that he wasn\u2019t putting in more effort to spend time with his daughter or the family. I sternly told her that my husband is working to provide for his family and that not everyone can just take weeks off at a time. Alison then said \u201cof course you\u2019d say that, you\u2019re basically paid to be his bang-nanny\u201d (I\u2019m a SAHM). I cannot remember the last time I was so enraged. Before i could even fully process my own thoughts, I said \u201cYeah, and you get cheated on for free. Tell me who got the better deal\u201d. \n\nFor context, everyone knows about Harvey\u2019s indiscretions, but I guess Alison didn\u2019t know we were aware.\n\nAlison went silent, then left the table. It\u2019s been two days and she hasn\u2019t said a word to me, barely any to anyone else, won\u2019t even make eye contact. Harvey is livid that I brought it up, but I told him he had his chance to make her stop and he didn\u2019t so I did. My dad said she fucked around and found out, my mom said she feels bad because Alison is quite obviously humiliated. I said she earned it from how she was always trying to embarrass my husband, but my mom says it\u2019s different because no one took her seriously.

Your dad hit the nail on the head.", "Talk shit get hit, NTA", "Its a bit weird your mom says no one takes her seriously, when it actually hurt both you and hubbys feelings and you have tried multiple times to get her to stop the comments.

Why does she feel the need to insert herself into your marriage? Why is she trying to sow discourse between you and your husband? You could have pulled a seriously patronizing move and used a gentle parenting technique to get to the root of her feelings. \n\nI agree with your father though. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. She needed to be taken down a peg. Good for you for having your husbands back.", "NTA. FAFO.", "Hell no YNTA! You\u2019re a genius!", "NTA. After insults to you and your husband which you have repeatedly asked her to stop, she then calls you a bang-nanny. She was well out of order, and though your response wasn't nice it was well deserved.", "NTA it sounds like she\u2019s extremely jealous and using 3rd wave feminism to try to take you down so she can feel better about herself.", "NTA. I like your dad\u2019s opinion. She FAFO.", "You stuck up for your family.

Your SIL has been told that her comments are inappropriate and she won\u2019t stop. Your brother has been told the same thing and he won\u2019t do anything about it. You all know your brother is a serial cheater and you just look the other way. Your husband isn\u2019t allowed to stand up for himself when his in laws are out of line.

Honestly, I think you were too nice.", "I sent as she is so unhappy with her marriage, she has to find ways to tear down and insult other husbands, to make herself feel better about her shitty husband.

I understand every family operates differently but if anyone disrespects my wife or children I would do the same thing", "NTA. It sounds like Alison is the kind of unhappy person who takes her pain out on those around them. Of course she attacks your husband. She needs to do so, because her husband\u2019s bad behavior hurts her ego and she needs to find a way to tell herself that all husbands are bad. Your brother dragged you into his bad marriage, he doesn\u2019t get to whine about it now.", "nta", "NTA, she obviously is insecure about her own relationship to the point that seeing a family dynamic that works in such a conventional way makes her jealous and angry.", "NTA hahaha I like this story.", "NTA your said said it right.

Whatever parenting style works for you is fine as long as your child is happy, cared for, and healthy.\n\nI hope she and your brother don't have any kids cause she sounds like a nightmare to co-parent with.

She got what she deserved.", "NTA - It's possible Alison just keeps picking at your husband because she is jealous of your relationship. And I'm gathering that's why your mother feels bad as well, because 'noone took her seriously.'

That rock through her glass house came with plenty of warnings.", "YTA for letting it happen to the point that you have to 'snap.'

SIL is just jealous because your relationship is functional and healthy and she's jealous. She can't be SAHM, can't have that trust in her relationship because your brother is doing scummy stuff.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL was attacking you husband to make herself feel better, so that she wasn't the only one with a shitty husband. You popped that balloon. Good for you.", "NTA. Of course she\u2019s miserable, her MO is clearly putting others down because she hates her own life and needs to be sure she\u2019s not the only one miserable, your comment didn\u2019t make that happen AT ALL. Your brother and SIL got what they were asking for, and neither has a right to be upset by what you said (as long as it was true).", "NTA\n\n**bang nanny** - seriously? That\u2019s well beyond that pale and a vulgar, very personal attack. Fuck that - she deserved whatever wrath came down upon her after that horrific comment. Zero sympathy!\n\nAt least your dad has your back. You very oddly left out your husband\u2019s response!? Hopefully he was appalled by Alison\u2019s slur and is supporting you aggressively defending yourself (and largely staying by the sidelines while supporting as it\u2019s more a family thing at this point).\n\nOf course Harvey is pissed - he\u2019s every bit as humiliated as his wife and he only has himself to blame - both for cheating and for not shutting down his wife\u2019s abhorrent behavior before it came to a head.\n\nYour mom\u2019s reaction feels like she\u2019s just trying to keep the peace, although she really should hold Allison - and Harvey - more accountable. She\u2019s more upset because there\u2019s no walking back from your comment - the cat is out of the bag and never going back in.\n\nIn summary - great job shutting down Allison. Her *bang nanny* comment absolutely demanded a strong response and virtually NO ONE was going to stand up to Allison\u2019s vitriol. You were forced into a corner and pounced like a lion - don\u2019t feel guilty for your reaction - feel bad that no one else was defending you until it was far, far too late.
