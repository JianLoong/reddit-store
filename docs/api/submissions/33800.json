She cornered you, and you weren't prepared to unload on her, especially when it's just the two of you alone. If you don't trust her as a person, you did the right thing to get out of there.\n\nYou may want to talk to your husband and have him be there when you have that conversation with her face to face, even if it's face time so you don't feel like someone can shut you off. That way you have support, you have your husband there while you get everything off of your chest. \n\nIt seems like her role as grandma is limited. She got shoes way too big because she didn't know the kids' sizes, which means there's a severe lack of communication, or she just ignores everything that is passed on by you if you told her these things. You need a safe space, and a way to mute her if she tries to interrupt you, and face timing would do that. Tell her you have to get off your chest things that bother you, and if she interrupts you, she will be muted and then unmuted when she's done, and you'll continue speaking where you left off. \n\nI wish you luck.", "NTA. She's lucky that you still invite her.", "Sometimes we have to make a judgement call on the spot and we do it, knowing from our gut, that it's the best thing to do. You know your MIL, you know how she operates, and you have years of experience of seeing her manipulation in all its forms.\n\nYou knew, at a deeper, visceral level, that this declaration of 'love' was just another ploy to get you to engage with her, and you also knew, that no matter what you said, that it wasn't going to end well. And so, you operated on self preservation mode and said, and did, nothing to engage.\n\nYou did the right thing.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a shame you don't have a better relationship with your MIL, but you don't have to tell anyone you love them if you don't love them. P.S. My MIL has never told me she loves me, but if she did, I'd probably say something like, \"OK,\" so you're definitely not alone.", "NTA. She sucks, so you don't love her. It would've been wrong to lie and say that you do. However, it's not like she's going away. I mean she's gonna be part of your life for a long time, so you might as well tell her what she has done wrong. Maybe she has enough self awareness to change and stop being shitty", "Nta, it wasn't the most adult reaction, but definitely the most diplomatic one.", "Somebody who really wants to repair a breach doesn't spring it on you as they are walking out the door. This was an attempt to manipulate you into saying words she wanted, and/or the opportunity to play the victim when you wouldn't. You weren't rude, you just didn't give her the performance she wanted. I don't know your story but if your instinct is to hide when you know you've failed her test, I'm going to assume there's a reason for that.\n\nNTA. She could have just taken \"you, too\" and moved on if she didn't have another agenda. I'm actually impressed you didn't play her game.", "Yeh, YTA unless you\u2019re 12.  When she indicated she wanted to have a serious conversation and understand what she\u2019s done wrong, you should have just said yes, let\u2019s do that sometime but now isn\u2019t the time.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019s done some crappy things, but you still own your behavior.\n\nYELLING \u201cokay bye\u201d and locking yourself in a bedroom is completely bizarre behavior.", "Without you explaining what it is she's done to make you dislike her and treat her badly, YTA. Hard to tell whether her attempt to reconcile/clear the air over xmas was well intended or just trying to stir up shit but how old are you? Dodging direct questions and literally running away from someone sounds SERIOUSLY childish. Grow up already.", "Buying kids shoes is actually quite hard if you don\u2019t know their size.  So you\u2019re reading a lot into something that could just be nothing.\n\nMuting someone and not listening to them is not the way to solve anything.  Having a session where you \u201cget things off your chest\u201d is also not helpful.  You should try to have a conversation where you both hear each other and try to understand each other.  \n\nYou can always go the \u201cfuck you\u201d route but you\u2019re teaching your child that and someday they may decide the \u201cfu\u201d should go to you.", "And if her gift giving sucks, help her out. An updated list every 6 months of sizes of your child. Indications of what he is into currently.  I hope you know this upsets your partner that you don't like her.....for what reason, exactly?", "and running to her bedroom like someone was chasing her is confusing as well- but yeah, still sticking with YTA", "I'm glad you expressed your opinion in an open forum, where you felt no pressure and weren't \"cornered\" to do so as OP explained in her post. It's very fortunate you have the ability to express how you think and feel without someone who is described as being unpredictable suddenly cornering you and acting kind, and trying to throw a conversation on you.\n\nBut I guess it's convenient from where you're sitting to ignore all of that and live in a make-believe fantasy world where that doesn't exist because you chose to overlook how the OP described the encounter.\n\nAlso muting someone when they are interrupting how you feel is the ONLY way that they learn that they need to listen. MIL, in case you missed her entire post, makes everything all about her.", "I\u2019d reply except I muted you at word ten.", "Thank you for your reply! <3 Keep living in that make-believe fantasy world you've made up your mind to exist in!"]}
