You have a very clear, very understandable issue that he needs to hear, needs to consider and hopefully he needs to adjust to. Instead of bringing that issue, you've chosen the petty path. I assume hoping he asks \"what gives\" we he arrives and sees you've altered your standard behavior.  Sure, you would be entitled to do this, but its the AH move. You could just have the convo. Its not black mail to point out to him that specifically TODAY, you need a break/sleep and generally, since birth, you haven't had a moment to yourself. Hopefully he is type of father/husband to see and rise up to correct this regardless if you go direct or petty, but is it AH to go the petty path?

You need to honestly tell him your needs, and not expect him to know them otherwise.  \nWorking it out together honestly is your responsibility to each other as a couple.   \n\nHOWEVER;  the fact that you needed to get our opinions about GETTING SOME FOOD for your (breastfeeding) self without  getting him any...   seems like such a small thing to even be concerned about.  \nIt shows how you need to practice taking care of YOU (your baby's mother), and it also shows that, if he would really be upset by your doing that, he's possibly just an inherently-selfish dude .", "NTA \n\nAnd you and your husband need to have a serious conversation about parenting time.
