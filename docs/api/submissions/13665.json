You have a very clear, very understandable issue that he needs to hear, needs to consider and hopefully he needs to adjust to. Instead of bringing that issue, you've chosen the petty path. I assume hoping he asks \"what gives\" we he arrives and sees you've altered your standard behavior.  Sure, you would be entitled to do this, but its the AH move. You could just have the convo. Its not black mail to point out to him that specifically TODAY, you need a break/sleep and generally, since birth, you haven't had a moment to yourself. Hopefully he is type of father/husband to see and rise up to correct this regardless if you go direct or petty, but is it AH to go the petty path?

Him going out on one night doesn\u2019t translate to not seeing parenting as a shared venture.

This isn't about \"parenting is a shared venture\" this is about you being resentful.", "Who says she's \"trapped at home with the baby 24/7\"?  She can take the baby with her, inform her husband that she has plans & he needs to be at home with the baby on a certain day/time, ask a friend or family member to watch the baby, or hire a baby sitter.
