After her two week vacation, he suggested they alternate nights at the gym.  He kept doing most of the chores since he couldn't breastfeed so he slept most of the night.

He wasn't there long - just for a run on the treadmill since it was often too cold outside - my first son was born in February. Was I annoyed he didn't get home earlier on the days he ran? Yes - I wanted him home as early as possible. Did I realize it would be unreasonable for me to demand he stop exercising so he could be home earlier - also yes, so I never asked him to stop. He would have been fine with me going to the gym in the evening - I just didn't want to.  \n\nIf he actually does start an argument because she didn't cook dinner - 100% TA.

She decided she shouldn\u2019t have to pump outside of every time he needs to eat. As a result, he wasn\u2019t getting enough. He needed formula as well. At that point my daughter just switched him over totally. Now I am not suggesting quitting breastfeeding, but instead supplementing with formula. At 4.5 months old, he should only need to eat every 4 hours. Obviously he\u2019s getting somewhat enough because you\u2019re doctor would have told you if you were starving him.

Personally, I would have texted him exactly what your plans are and since he's out drinking, he can order his own damn food.\n\nFWIW, when my wife was on maternity leave, I hauled my ass home to help, every day, for the whole damn 3 months, and this actually lasted much longer than that because our daughter was a difficult baby. And this was after seeing 40 patients a day, talking high anxiety patients off a cliff multiple times daily while managing a business. I didn't get to work out as much as I wanted to. I didn't get to game or go hang out with friends as much as I wanted to. That's the decision you make when you decide to have children.
