I told her that she knows these situations give me anxiety and especially today (I'm going through a really hard breakup right now) I need her to act like a grown up and not put me in a situation where I would have to baby her because I just don't have the mental capacity (and frankly the nerve) to do so. \n\nWell, it caused a huge debade in our friendgroup in which they conclude that I am the AH because \"what if she gets drunk and then a guy takes her home and something happens to her\" and that I \"know Becky tends torwards selfdestructive behaviour and it is irresponsible to not look after her\". Tbh, I don't see how that is my responsibility, and I feel like I am doing the responsible thing by telling her that if she does not think she can controll herself she should just stay home. Also, babysitting her in my opinion only teaches her that she does not have to work on her behaviour, therefor I am no longer willing to entertain that notion. I know that this is drastic, which is why I'm wondering if I am taking this too far and am beeing the AH, especially because I would indeed follow thrugh and not protect her from her own actions.

There's a magnitude of accountability that needs to be taken by those who put themselves at risk, especially when you have control over it. If this was her first time drinking then sure, as a friend I'd do my best at preventing her to be a victim for predators but if she's repeatedly putting herself at risk by drinking irresponsibly then it's on her.\n\nFor example, my neighbourhood is known for chain snatching so It'll be irresponsible for me to walk around flaunting my gold chains and hope for a happy ending because predators will do what they do.
