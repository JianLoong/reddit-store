I eat everything she makes with zero complaints. Today she spent about seven hours cooking braised beef cheek while I worked for several hours. \n\nI\u2019ve never eaten beef cheek before, and she warned me it\u2019d look a bit different compared to normal beef due to the muscles and all. When she started to pull it apart, it was grey on the inside and so off putting. I gave her a very disinterested face and was less than enthused and I can tell she was a bit hurt I wasn\u2019t more excited about it. I tried some, It tasted exactly like meat you\u2019d put in shepherds pie and I said she went through a lot of effort for little reward. \n\nAfter that she got quiet and started eating a very small plate of the beef cheek and sides. I went back to working in the same room. By the time I looked up at her, she was packing up the dinner into leftover boxes and cleaning dishes. I got upset by her reaction and headed off to bed without eating. \n\n20 minutes later she comes into the bedroom with a burger and some croquettes that she cooked for me but I told her I wasn\u2019t hungry and was going to bed. When she heard that, she gave her dog my burger and has ignored me since. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678051123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11je5od/aita_for_not_eating_dinner_my_girlfriend_cooked/", "score": 3278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were unkind for no reason.", "YTA.  *Please* do her a favor and break up with her.

We\u2019d spent the money on it, I\u2019d cooked dinner, and served my wife this god awful looking steak next to veggies and rice. She tried a bite, smiled and thanked me for cooking, and continued eating it with no complaints or weird faces.

You tried the food and said that the taste wasn\u2019t worth the effort. Already an AH comment because it sounds like you didn\u2019t actually dislike it. And then it gets worse: \n4.

What reaction did you want? \n6. She makes you a different food (do you know that you don\u2019t deserve her?) \n7.

Cheek meat in general is considered to be one of the best parts of the animal.  While not particularly expensive, it's still generally understood as being fancy and high end.

Putting away leftovers?) to your rude attitude, and then she went out of her way to cook a whole new dinner for you which you *again* sneered at and refused to eat.

She made you TWO meals and you didn't eat both? I made a lame ass curry which i know didn't taste amazing and yet my wife praised and ate it. Because she appreciated the effort i put in it.

You big time TA though.", "While beef cheek is an acquired taste, it is actually considered a delicacy due to the high collagen content, and is excellent briased.

Or maybe that it tastes like something you've had before. To say the thing you did (bigwork/littlereward) was hurtful. She did put a lot of work into it. Maybe look into sensitivity training. You can be 100% honest without being mean and the comment was mean. And THEN she went and made something she know you'd like and you had a widdle temper tantrum because your rude comment hurt her feelings and through her love for you STILL made your ungrateful ass some food. Damn. \n\nThere are people who would unalive someone for a woman like that!", "Nooooooo! You're about to win a promotion to family cook. YTA.\n\n1) When someone has labored over something and the recipe is a bust or not to your taste, that's the time for a polite white lie- \"smells great\",  \"I'm starving\",  \"what do you think of it?\". Not all recipes are winners- it's the price you pay for eating home cooked food. Either start cooking, pay for take out or start being more polite about the occasional miss.\n\n2) When you are a jerk about a recipe fail AND she makes you a second dinner? That's her trying to make up for your petulant behavior. A wise man would accept the lifeline she threw you and say thank you. Instead you doubled down. \n\nIf she were the one writing it I'd suggest that she swap chores with you, you start cooking and give it a year.", "YTA\n\nI can understand if you were squeamish about the unusual meat. You are not required to love every meal she cooks... but she spent *seven hours* on it. Think of it not as that individual meal you were enjoying or not enjoying, but the overall experience of your girlfriend pampering you with good home cooked meals and baking, which I'm pretty sure you probably enjoy! So I think you should have politely eaten some and complimented her efforts and in the future if she asked if you would like to have this again, say that perhaps there is another dish of hers you love so much more... out of appreciation that she cooks and bakes for you and that this means you are a lucky woman rather than eating PBJ and tv dinners every night. \n\nAnd refusing the second dinner she made was just awful.

You tried the meat she'd been preparing for hours and told her it wasn't worth her effort.

Should she have put off eating her food in order to whip up a new meal that would be up to your standards?

Separately if you were just not eating the other meal out of spite because you were upset for some weird reason then you are doubly the AH. If you didn\u2019t eat the burger because genuinely you weren\u2019t hungry this is not an AH move. \nThat said her reaction of being hurt and not talking to you for not at minimum saying thank you and being annoyed with her is appropriate and does not make her the AH!", "Lol Jesus Christ. Yeah, YTA. Look up ungrateful in the dictionary and report back with your findings.", "YTA, so not only did you put down the meal she spent several hours making for you, you got pissy with her after you left the table and she decided to clean up and then acted like a toddler when she brought you a new dinner.

I want to be sure I have this right.   \n\n\nYour girlfriends spends SEVEN HOURS making something new.  You make a face at her food. (Not a great start, but recoverable at this point.). You already know she\u2019s hurt, but instead of apologizing for hurting her feelings, you decide to dig in and make a point of insulting her food and choices.  Now she\u2019s really hurt.  Can\u2019t blame her. But instead of calling you out for being an AH, she eats her meal and cleans up.   \n\n\nSomehow you perform the mental gymnastics of getting upset because of her pretty calm and normal reaction to being insulted and hurt by her loved one.  You go into sulking mode, some nice main character syndrome here, and leave without eating.\n\nNow, your girlfriend SHOULD leave you to it. Instead, she tries to make it up to you by cooking you a second meal.  This is an olive branch that you definitely do not deserve. And which you turn down!?!?!  Honestly, what is wrong with you?

I eat everything she makes with zero complaints. Today she spent about seven hours cooking braised beef cheek while I worked for several hours. \n\nI\u2019ve never eaten beef cheek before, and she warned me it\u2019d look a bit different compared to normal beef due to the muscles and all. When she started to pull it apart, it was grey on the inside and so off putting. I gave her a very disinterested face and was less than enthused and I can tell she was a bit hurt I wasn\u2019t more excited about it. I tried some, It tasted exactly like meat you\u2019d put in shepherds pie and I said she went through a lot of effort for little reward. \n\nAfter that she got quiet and started eating a very small plate of the beef cheek and sides. I went back to working in the same room. By the time I looked up at her, she was packing up the dinner into leftover boxes and cleaning dishes. I got upset by her reaction and headed off to bed without eating. \n\n20 minutes later she comes into the bedroom with a burger and some croquettes that she cooked for me but I told her I wasn\u2019t hungry and was going to bed. When she heard that, she gave her dog my burger and has ignored me since. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
