I eat everything she makes with zero complaints. Today she spent about seven hours cooking braised beef cheek while I worked for several hours. \n\nI\u2019ve never eaten beef cheek before, and she warned me it\u2019d look a bit different compared to normal beef due to the muscles and all. When she started to pull it apart, it was grey on the inside and so off putting. I gave her a very disinterested face and was less than enthused and I can tell she was a bit hurt I wasn\u2019t more excited about it. I tried some, It tasted exactly like meat you\u2019d put in shepherds pie and I said she went through a lot of effort for little reward. \n\nAfter that she got quiet and started eating a very small plate of the beef cheek and sides. I went back to working in the same room. By the time I looked up at her, she was packing up the dinner into leftover boxes and cleaning dishes. I got upset by her reaction and headed off to bed without eating. \n\n20 minutes later she comes into the bedroom with a burger and some croquettes that she cooked for me but I told her I wasn\u2019t hungry and was going to bed. When she heard that, she gave her dog my burger and has ignored me since. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678051123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11je5od/aita_for_not_eating_dinner_my_girlfriend_cooked/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were unkind for no reason.", "YTA.  *Please* do her a favor and break up with her.

We\u2019d spent the money on it, I\u2019d cooked dinner, and served my wife this god awful looking steak next to veggies and rice. She tried a bite, smiled and thanked me for cooking, and continued eating it with no complaints or weird faces.

What reaction did you want? \n6. She makes you a different food (do you know that you don\u2019t deserve her?) \n7.

You big time TA though.", "While beef cheek is an acquired taste, it is actually considered a delicacy due to the high collagen content, and is excellent briased.

Or maybe that it tastes like something you've had before. To say the thing you did (bigwork/littlereward) was hurtful. She did put a lot of work into it. Maybe look into sensitivity training. You can be 100% honest without being mean and the comment was mean. And THEN she went and made something she know you'd like and you had a widdle temper tantrum because your rude comment hurt her feelings and through her love for you STILL made your ungrateful ass some food. Damn. \n\nThere are people who would unalive someone for a woman like that!", "Nooooooo! You're about to win a promotion to family cook. YTA.\n\n1) When someone has labored over something and the recipe is a bust or not to your taste, that's the time for a polite white lie- \"smells great\",  \"I'm starving\",  \"what do you think of it?\". Not all recipes are winners- it's the price you pay for eating home cooked food. Either start cooking, pay for take out or start being more polite about the occasional miss.\n\n2) When you are a jerk about a recipe fail AND she makes you a second dinner? That's her trying to make up for your petulant behavior. A wise man would accept the lifeline she threw you and say thank you. Instead you doubled down. \n\nIf she were the one writing it I'd suggest that she swap chores with you, you start cooking and give it a year.", "YTA\n\nI can understand if you were squeamish about the unusual meat.

Think of it not as that individual meal you were enjoying or not enjoying, but the overall experience of your girlfriend pampering you with good home cooked meals and baking, which I'm pretty sure you probably enjoy! So I think you should have politely eaten some and complimented her efforts and in the future if she asked if you would like to have this again, say that perhaps there is another dish of hers you love so much more... out of appreciation that she cooks and bakes for you and that this means you are a lucky woman rather than eating PBJ and tv dinners every night. \n\nAnd refusing the second dinner she made was just awful.

Should she have put off eating her food in order to whip up a new meal that would be up to your standards?

Separately if you were just not eating the other meal out of spite because you were upset for some weird reason then you are doubly the AH. If you didn\u2019t eat the burger because genuinely you weren\u2019t hungry this is not an AH move. \nThat said her reaction of being hurt and not talking to you for not at minimum saying thank you and being annoyed with her is appropriate and does not make her the AH!", "Lol Jesus Christ. Yeah, YTA.

I want to be sure I have this right.   \n\n\nYour girlfriends spends SEVEN HOURS making something new.  You make a face at her food. (Not a great start, but recoverable at this point.). You already know she\u2019s hurt, but instead of apologizing for hurting her feelings, you decide to dig in and make a point of insulting her food and choices.  Now she\u2019s really hurt.  Can\u2019t blame her. But instead of calling you out for being an AH, she eats her meal and cleans up.   \n\n\nSomehow you perform the mental gymnastics of getting upset because of her pretty calm and normal reaction to being insulted and hurt by her loved one.  You go into sulking mode, some nice main character syndrome here, and leave without eating.\n\nNow, your girlfriend SHOULD leave you to it. Instead, she tries to make it up to you by cooking you a second meal.  This is an olive branch that you definitely do not deserve. And which you turn down!?!?!  Honestly, what is wrong with you?  Had you not hurt her enough?  Are you TRYING to punish her for making something different?    \n\n\nYes!  YTA.  I hope your girlfriends finds the confidence she needs to stop trying to cater to your manipulative behaviour and finds someone who treats her better.", "She made you a second meal to please you and you snubbed her for it. Nice,  YTA,", "INFO: why did her packing up the leftovers and doing dishes make you upset? you didn\u2019t want to eat it so she ate her portion and put it away. wtf is wrong with that", "YTA\n\nLooks pretty unanimous. Not liking the beef is fine. Try a bite maybe for her efforts? If you don't like it then you don't like it. You could still sit down and eat the rest of the meal she prepared, thank her, help her clean up? Is it so difficult to be nice to her just because you didn't like the meal?  \n\n\nEveryone is TA from time to time. Now that you see you are in the wrong, make it up to her. Make her her favorite meal or take her out to her favorite restaurant maybe?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I eat everything she makes with zero complaints. Today she spent about seven hours cooking braised beef cheek while I worked for several hours. \n\nI\u2019ve never eaten beef cheek before, and she warned me it\u2019d look a bit different compared to normal beef due to the muscles and all. When she started to pull it apart, it was grey on the inside and so off putting. I gave her a very disinterested face and was less than enthused and I can tell she was a bit hurt I wasn\u2019t more excited about it. I tried some, It tasted exactly like meat you\u2019d put in shepherds pie and I said she went through a lot of effort for little reward. \n\nAfter that she got quiet and started eating a very small plate of the beef cheek and sides. I went back to working in the same room. By the time I looked up at her, she was packing up the dinner into leftover boxes and cleaning dishes. I got upset by her reaction and headed off to bed without eating. \n\n20 minutes later she comes into the bedroom with a burger and some croquettes that she cooked for me but I told her I wasn\u2019t hungry and was going to bed. When she heard that, she gave her dog my burger and has ignored me since. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "So you can be rude to her and expect that to go completely unchecked but she packs up dinner and that\u2019s unacceptable. Yeah\u2026 YTA.", "When someone cooks, they do it with love. The efforts and time aren't lost, even if the food doesn't taste that good, because we cooked thinking about the person/s that is/are eating with us. \n\nThis could've been a funny story about a not-so-good meal, but you just turned it on an awful moment for your gf. And what's worse, she took the time to cook you something else so you could eat and it doesn't even matter to you. \n\nYTA... totally.", "YTA. And that dog definitely deserved that burger more than you.", "YTA 100%. she cooked you 2 meals and you refused both to be petty", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019d said that BS to me, after I worked for half a day making something, you would have to be cooking for yourself from that minute on.", "YTA is that how you appreciate her? Uh..", "YTA. Shame on you for this ungrateful, entitled, childish behaviour.", " > I got upset by her reaction\n\n\u2026wtf reaction did *she* have?\n\nBro, *your* behavior was upsetting. She cooked you dinner *twice.* You insulted her first dinner, and rejected *both.* You left the cleanup to *her?*\n\nGrow up.\n\nYTA", "YTA I can promise you I have made things my partner was less then pleased to eat but they plastered a smile and said thanks.", "YTA. You sound like a spoiled, ungrateful child. If a 5 year old acted this way, it would be rude but understandable. You're a grown man. Learn how to act respectfully.", "[deleted]", "YTA.\n\nIt's ok to not like everything your partner cooks but when she tried to make it up to you with another meal and you chose not to accept it, it became your fault.", "INFO Nevermind the beef cheeks for now, why were you annoyed at her for clearing up? Why did you say you went to bed without eating? Where you just huffing bc she made something you didn't like?", "Info: what reaction of hers upset you?\n\n- That she spent 7 hours cooking for you?\n- that after she cooked for you she also cleaned alone and packed away the leftovers?\n- that she cooked you a second dinner?\n- that when you didn't want the second dinner either, she gave it to someone who did?\n- that she tolerated your asshole behaviour all this time without punching you in the face?\n- that she not only didn't punch you in the face, but even did something nice for you again after each of your asshole actions?\n\nSo again: which of her reactions upset you?", "This can't be real. Nobody can be so dense and don't see that they're a major assholes twice, right? I really can't believe someone would really act like you OP, except to deliberately hurt your girlfriend as much as you can. YTA, a colossal one.", "YTA, not just because of your childish tantrum, but because of the comment you made \n\nMy husband is Italian. So I tried to make lasagne one day for him. It was not great. Like, it tastes good but the pasta sheets were a little hard. He ate the whole thing. Even though I said he didn't have to, because I knew it was horrible.\n\n\n>and I said she went through a lot of effort for little reward. \n\nThat really wasn't necessary and would have made you the AH without the tantrum afterwards.\n\nBe a better partner.", "YTA. The fact that you managed to blame her for your garbage mood astounds me. All you had to say is that you didn't like it, but your comment about the food was plain rude, then you proceeded to blame her for being quiet after you offended her.\n\nShe even went through the effort to make you something else and you decided to be an AH about it.", "YTA what are you even upset about? Your girlfriend didn't make you keep eating, she didn't yell or cry, she just finished eating and cleaned up. Then went on to make your ungrateful ass a SECOND meal (that you refused to eat) after you disrespected and insulted her. Don't be surprised when you have to start cooking your own meals from now on because I have a feeling your girlfriend isn't planning to put anymore effort into cooking for the petulant child she's been living with.", "I'm flummoxed. Youuuu got upset?? YTA all the way", "She spent 7 hours cooking and you couldn't have said something more tactful than that?  Then you got upset at *her* reaction?  And then she made you something you like and you rejected it?  It seems like you owe her 3 apologies. \n\nYTA", "YTA - you\u2019re ungrateful and rude.", "You\u2019re an insufferable and mean spirited asshole. What the hell is wrong with you?", "OP trained his gf to be like his mum. Well done OP. You throw tantrums and mama brings another snack. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou were rude and ungrateful which upset her then you got upset that she was upset?? Wtf?\n\nGet over yourself and apologize", "Fucking hell, dude, YTA and how do you not know this already? Common human decency just never occurred to you?", "Yta and also an ungrateful little brat. Also, she has to clean in addition to cooking, so you\u2019re lazy too. What exactly do you bring to this relationship?", "I have some issues with food texture, and there was recently a dish that my husband wanted to try. Based on the description alone (ground beef and rice), I knew it was unlikely to be something that I could handle. I told him to cook it anyway, and if I couldn't do it I would make something else for myself. He should get meals he wants even if my stupid brain won't cooperate. \n\nSure enough, I couldn't do more than a couple of bites. Do you know what I did?\n\nI complimented it. The flavors worked really well together. The rice was the exactly the perfect texture (tricky in a one-pan meal). It wasn't something that I could eat, but I appreciated the effort he put in. I know he was still a little hurt, and I did my best to reassure him that he did an excellent job - the texture thing is a *me* problem.", "So let me see if I got this right, your gf busted hump on a dish that from the sounds of it the only problem was that she overcooked it, you were impolite, she went to the trouble of making you a SECOND MEAL which you denied and you don't think you are the problem? \n\nYTA.\n\nAlso wtf you mean you got upset by her packing everything up and cleaning? Wtf else was she supposed to do? Come apologize for putting in too much effort for someone who didn't appreciate it?", "YTA. Beef cheeks are definitely more gamey and not for everyone but you just completely insulted her time and effort and then when she then went above and beyond and made you something she knows you like, you refused to eat it like a snob. \n\nAnd why is SHE doing the dishes after she spent 7 hours cooking for you? \n\nI hope she never cooks another meal for you. You'll learn to appreciate the effort it takes to put together a nice meal when you are eating TV dinners and Ramen. \n\nBtw...the filling for shephers pie is LAMB.", "Also, not really the point but everyone keeps referring to OP as a \u201che\u201d and unless a typo has clearly identified themself as (f).", "YTA, and you\u2019re old enough to know better than to treat someone you love like this.", "Info: what on earth were YOU upset about??? \n\nYTA. You were a jerk and the poor woman still made a second meal for you and you decided to be a jerk AGAIN.", "YTA. \n\nLemme frame this for you \n\n> My girlfriend spent hours cooking a time intensive meal that she warned me not to be judgmental about. I was judgmental, childish, and made a face. When I tried it I insulted the effort she\u2019d gone to. That must have hurt her feelings because she got quiet, which pissed me off. She made me a new meal, something I do like, but I refused to eat it and acted like a child to punish her for having hurt feelings over my shitty behavior. \n\nWhat part of this story do you feel like you were being remotely reasonable?", "YTA\n\n7 hours?????? I get that you're not going to like everything someone cooks, but this is a long ass time and so much effort!\n\n\rI'm giving you more AH points because she made you ANOTHER meal, and yet you rejected that.

If it had stopped at the initial bit, where you didn't especially like beef cheek, hey, it happens.

YTA", "I'm confused as to what you wanted her reaction to be?? She didn't get mad at you or say hurtful things. You insulted her then ignored her. She got quiet and cleaned up, and that's offensive to you? What should she have done, been thrilled about your insults and ignoring her? She even made you a whole second meal and you refused that. I'm so confused what you can possibly think she did wrong in this situation. To be clear, you are very much and completely the AH.", "YTA: She tried to make up for your disappointment by cooking a whole different meal and you dissed her. Might be the last time she ever does, too.", "YTA. \n\n>I got upset by her reaction and headed off to bed without eating. \n\nYou sound like a big baby. She went out of her way to make you something she knew you would like to make it up to you and you pouted like a child. I'm glad she gave your meal to her dog. \n\nIt's a shame, too, because if you're a meat-eater beef cheeks can be pretty great. Also, they don't taste like lamb so your comparison sounds a bit odd.", "Was gonna say NTA until I read that you wouldn't eat the second meal she prepared for you. You were hungry you just wanted to be spiteful\n\n\nYTA", "You are N T A for not eating the food she made if you didn\u2019t care for it, but YTA for insulting her effort and then pouting like a toddler when her feelings were hurt. I bet that beef cheek was delicious!\n\nEven my 6-year-old knows to thank me for dinner and then make himself a sandwich if he isn\u2019t interested in what I\u2019ve made.", "YTA. Simple. You told your girlfriend that all the effort she made was wasted as it tasted the same as something else. It's much like telling a baker who hand makes each cake that you could just make the same thing with box mix.", "OP has a knack for digging a hole and jumping in, then digging a bigger hole underneath that, and burying herself in that. OP, YTA x 2.", "Woman", "You literally did EVERYTHING wrong.  I didn't think you deserve the time for me to make a list to point out out, so I'm pleased this later did.

It\u2019s childish and immature, but it\u2019s the only explanation I can think of", "That's what I don't understand. Why are you upset with her for packing things up and cleaning. Your reaction seems to be that you didn't care for it. You went back to work and said nothing about eating or needing to finish something before you ate. Is she supposed to read your mind? Are you saying you were going to eat it later? \n\nAlso, how did you miss that she was cooking something else for you? She tried to make sure you had a meal you would like and you acted like a sullen teenager.\n\nYTA", "Wrong AITA post, though I just read that one not long ago!", "Honestly, even her initial reactions made her TA.

If the girl had said or did anything whilst doing it, OP would have included that. \n\nReasonably the only thing i can think is the the gf was upset, so OP got angry at the GF being sad to flip the table so that the gf was the one trying to apologize, and not OP. Except the gf flipped it back by not begging OP to eat the second meal she made, she fed it to the dog and ignored OP, so now OP is forced to take responsibility for their actions to some effect.
