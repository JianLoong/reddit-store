Not if he's funtional enough to go to work every day.\n\nYou mentioned that your parents found out about the weed a few years ago which upset your mom, but your brother denied it. Did your parents believe him, or did they give him anither chance and he blew it?\n\nYou may need to tread lightly in how you present this, otherwise you could come out of this looking like a jealous brother.\n\nNTA. They need to know what's going on in their house. If he's asking you for money, he's most likely running out of time to pay his supplier, which could lead to unpleasant consequences for your parents as well.", "Don't give him money, and I'd say don't tell your parents. But definitely confront him about his health and your concerns, because those are real. If he's evasive enough with his answers after that that you're still concerned, I'd tell your parents about the parts of him that concern you. Not the weed. He can have weight gain or depression or financial issues, without weed factoring in", "Thousands a month?! On herb? I legit need it for tourette's syndrome and my seizures as one hit instantly stops my ticks.. all I pay is 150 for five! one gram carts dispensary and it lasts well over a month. I really have to know what he's buying to Warrant even half of that a month!\n\nNo disrespect but I'd recommend a psychiatrist and psychologist, Look into why it's this excessive and why he feels the need to spend that much. He potentially may need to be on medications that calm the nerves similar to herb, But takes a few weeks of adjustment and he has to stick with what works best for him.\n\nBut thousands I just cant wrap my head around that.", "Sounds like coke", "Sounds like he's spending money on cocaine. NTA please say something", "NTA bc it definitely isn't weed. My weed runs cap out at, like, 200 bucks and that covers my roommate and I for 2-3 months. Granted, we're not heavy consumers. A tube of edibles runs around 25 bones, so an entire one of those every single day would run 750. \n\nIf I had to guess, I would say he's pretty far down the line at this point. Addictive drug habits usually start cheap and become more expensive when you need a larger dose for the same high. \n\nYou may want to see about having a conversation or intervention. Something is definitely wrong.", "NTA - but I also wouldn't give him any money. It is just too damn bad he has smoked everything he earns. Seems like he should spend some money on hobbies, going out with friends, traveling, perhaps even a therapist.", "Yes it is none of your business at this point", "Yes, you would be the A.\n\nDon't snitch.", "Something else is going on here. I\u2019ve been a daily weed smoker for years and I don\u2019t come anywhere close to spending a thousand dollars a month. Plus, marijuana isn\u2019t going to make your weight fluctuate; you might gain from having the munchies but it\u2019s not going to make you lose weight. I think your brother has a heavier drug problem since you also mentioned mood swings. My guess is coke or meth. \n\nI personally don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with smoking weed so I wouldn\u2019t tell your parents about that. I\u2019d have a heart to heart conversation with him and tell him your concerns and that you suspect he has a more serious problem. If he admits to a serious issue, it may be time to talk to your parents.

Something is wrong, he might need help, they might need to consider removing him from the house for their well being.", "That's not weed money. Or behavior.\n\nHe has some kind of other problem. And a serious one.\n\nNTA.", "It could be weed,idk what kind of stuff people smoke here but there is weed or concetrates that are same value as coke prices and yes when some people are having weed withdrawls they can get very moody", "None of this is weed my guy. Your brother has some other habits. Keep your dollars.", "YTA telling on him is not the way to help him. All it would do is isolate him more and make him not trust you which means that when he needs help he won\u2019t come to you.

Your parents could have had him paying rent etc from the get go, and didn\u2019t. It\u2019s THEIR business. Now, I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb here and say his problem seems to be more than weed. It sounds like coke or meth. Especially with fluctuating weight and irritability. I highly suggest having a sit down with him. It could also be possible he lost his job and hasn\u2019t told anyone? Doesn\u2019t solve the other issue, but it is VERY unlikely he\u2019s smoking thousands of dollars worth of marijuana a month.. best of luck. I hope I\u2019m wrong.", "I don't have the answers, but I'm concerned weed isn't his only drug. If you run low on money,  you can buy cheaper weed.

I doubt he would be as evasive, Moody, and aggressive if it was just weed. Speaking from personal experience, both as the addicted person and as the family member, tell your parents. My brother is in a similar situation and he got into trouble like that for a while.", "NTA, also probably not weed like everyone's saying. And... did you give him the money? If there's any way to, avoid giving him the money!", "If his weight is fluctuating a lot it\u2019s almost always a sign of hard drug use (all of which cost more than weed).\n\nHe\u2019s either doing blow, meth, or heroin/opiates (very unlikely because using opiates is very noticeable even to someone that doesn\u2019t know the telltale signs).\n\nI would look more at coke than meth because it\u2019s more socially acceptable to use, and it definitely costs a lot more.\n\nHowever, irritability mood swings and overall aggression can absolutely point towards meth. It\u2019s just that meth is pretty noticeable too", "NTA k so your brother sounds like a smart guy. And let me just say there\u2019s no way he\u2019s only spending his money on weed. Even if he likee to buy small amounts and different strands of high grade weed I\u2019d say he still wouldn\u2019t be spending more than 1000/month based off of my own experience with an ex. \n\nNow with my experience watch a friend struggle with addiction\u2026 if he\u2019s dabbling in the nose nachos, he can easily be spending 2000 upwards and would more likely be the cause of weight fluctuations. \n\nYou should keep an eye when he come home to confirm in his behaviour if this is the case.\n\n\u2022wide Pupils\n\u2022sleepless nights\n\u2022inability to find humour in conversation(not laughing)\n\u2022serious and anxious demeanour\n\u2022teeth clenching if he\u2019s done a lot\n\u2022nose blowing or sniffling\n\u2022touching his nose\n\u2022and maybe the most obvious.. lil white pieces in his nose\n\nIf that\u2019s the case yes tell your parent and consider family intervention.", "NTA\n\nI mean... I consider myself to be a heavy weed user and I don't spend more than like $300 on weed per month. I'm not sure how he is managing to spend thousands of dollars on weed to the point where he doesn't have money or remaining weed. \n\nUnfortunately it sounds like he might be using his money to buy a different drug while using weed as his cover up since it's easier for other people to accept and especially since his family already knows. Mood swings and behavior changes CAN happen with marijuana but the spending is what's really convincing me here. Weed just doesn't cost THAT much.\n\nIf he wasn't spending this much money on weed I would probably lean closer to YTA but I'm feeling a bit concerned for him as a stranger. I think if you were to voice your concerns to anyone it would be your parents. You know your parents better than the internet so you make the judgement on how they'll react. I would suggest approaching them about the fact that he asked you for money and that you are concerned about his spending habits and see where it goes from there before discussing the weed/drugs.", "Nta. Also not a weed habit. That's a crazy amount of money he's getting through. It'll be something additional and something he may need help and support with.  Good luck.", "Perhaps this is my ignorance and there exists some top of the line incredibly expensive weed out there that I don't know about?  But it seems to me that there aren't enough hours in the day for a person to consume thousands of dollars of weed per month, certainly not if that person has a job say 8 hours a day where people would notice he was stoned off his ass and he didn't get to retire to the restroom every 15 minutes to take another hit.\n\nTo my mind, your brother's money is almost certainly going toward something else that he doesn't want to tell you about.  Cocaine?  Pornography?  Gambling? Who knows.\n\nThe thing is, you don't know. So it's hard to see the point of telling your folks unless what he's doing is endangering them (as in dealing out of their house) or endangering his life (heroin).

I am not a big weed smoker, but I know weed doesn't clean you out financially like that.

At least where I live (and in many other jurisdictions in the US), there's something called \"forfeiture\" laws.  Meaning, if he IS dealing anything illegal out of your parents house and the cops end up doing a raid, they can seize the HOUSE as being tied up in the crime.  Same thing if he ever borrows their car and deals while he's in that (working in criminal justice for 20+ years).\n\nThat aside, I agree with everyone else - there's definitely more than personal weed use going on.  Speaking as an addict in recovery, he's unlikely to admit to anything and very unlikely to stop doing whatever it is that he's doing because he's in an ideal situation.  Living well for free?  No expectations outside of maintaining a job (which probably won't last much longer if he is doing harder drugs)?  It's every addict's dream.  There's no incentive to stop.  Take away the cushion and let him hit bottom.

I said fuck it, and left him in charge of all the spending; SURPRISE! None of the bills were getting paid anymore after I did. I lost my favorite car (purchased for me by MY dad) because we had to pawn the title to pay bills. \n\nI found out later it was not, in fact, weed our money was going to. I should add here that I also smoked with him and helped purchase it so I knew what the prices were, and that led me to suspect it was a harder substance. His mom REFUSED to believe me when I said that I left him completely in charge of our money when she kept fielding calls about unpaid bills, even AFTER I showed her I had no money on me or my card at all. I'm pretty sure she died not knowing he'd become an addict, but I do know she died no longer believing I was the one at fault for nothing being paid. She had no choice but to come to that realization once I'd left him (with our toddler) and it was still happening. \n\nYour brother is NOT spending thousands of dollars a month on weed; he should no longer be given money!

I\u2019m sure it will be a shock to mom and dad, but it would be a bigger shock to get a phone call from an emergency room saying he overdosed and they couldn\u2019t save him.  I\u2019ve seen family\u2019s go through identifying a loved ones body first hand and you do want want your parents to go through that.

Or he wastes a lot. \n\nSounds like he needs to grow up, pay some bills, and stop getting blasted all the time before he loses his job.

I would ask his friends if there's something going on and see if they're willing to spill.. If he has depression or another mi he may be self medicating in his own way. \n\nConsidering he's asking for money, I would mention that to your parents..not what he spends it on.

I didn't know how often he smoked until I started spending large amounts of time with him. He'd smoke 4+ times a day, which I considered a lot. I know about how much he was paying because he'd talk about it, but it was nowhere near thousands a month. \n\nMy ex would get moody and evasive when he wouldn't get a chance to smoke. His weed habit and his behavior ruined our relationship. He'd tell me he was running an errand, wouldn't tell me where. He'd make multiple trips to the dispensary a week, and I found out later he was meeting up with his \"plug\" too. It was just too much for me. His entire life was centered around smoking, which is typical of an addict.\n\nI think your brother may have something else going on. The fact that he's 33, has a well paying job, but lives at home is a red flag. He's not helping either... I suggest having a conversation with him. He may be using harder drugs.", "WNBTA.

I would speak to him first and see if you can get him to be honest about what's actually going on - before you go to your parents. That step can't be taken back, and will likely lead to him refusing to talk about it at all, and also masking him feel like he can't come to you for help in the future. \n\nUnfortunately, in my experience, one of these three situations is what's actually going on:\n1. He's lying about which drug he's using because he is ashamed and/or doesn't want to be judged/see the disappointment in your faces.\n2. He's smoking up multiple friends who don't chip in weed or cash (is he a people pleaser?

You don't do drugs if you're already happy and healthy emotionally and mentally. Rehab sucks ass if it doesn't vibe with him. Family counseling and individual therapy for him are what he needs. Getting upset will only make him want to do more drugs. I've never been addicted to hard drugs. I smoke weed for pain management, but both my older sisters are drug addicts. Meth made them violent, aggressive, and paranoid. Heroine turned them into part of the floor they'd lay there for hours.

Correct me if I'm wrong; you have a 30 year old man, who is not taking on any financial responsibility, being cared for by his parents, while he's in a well paid job.

If he was early-mid 20s fresh out of college/uni I could understand it. Maybe its different where I'm from but why on earth is a 30 year old man relying on his parents if he: A has a well paying job B pays no bills and C has no financial responsibility. That seems ludicrous IMO.", "I'm not going to lie, as a weed smoker it's kinda sounding like your bro needs an intervention.\n\nIs he OK?

She started off smoking a bit more to help quell her frequent nausea (and yes, she had seen specialists for her GI issues).\n\nAt first, the weed worked great, but eventually she was vomiting so much that she couldn't stand the smell of food, so she would smoke more and more because the weed helps her appetite, right? But then it would be more vomiting. She was acting like a zombie in between paydays because she couldn't eat and couldn't sleep without the weed. She would sit in a shower for hours. She blew through her savings, she was spending whole paychecks on nothing but crackers, gas, and weed products, trying to find something that worked to quell the stomach issues. She didn't want to go to a doctor because they had never been able to find anything wrong before.\n\nI don't know why she was so fixated on weed helping her; I think she was so desperate because it was literally the only thing since she was a child that helped her nausea, and she didn't want to give it up.\n\nSo after being referred by the ER to someone who is researching CHS, and a therapist who has been specializing in this area, she's fine. They basically said she cannot continue to use marijuana or she will die eventually. Yes, she was physically and mentally dependent on marijuana, and it was killing her body.\n\nSupposedly, this happens to a lot more people than previously thought, but since some people are casual and infrequent users, and since there's a very low number of self-reporting cases, it's been hard to pin down. They are seeing it more and more in younger generations.\n\n\n\n\nNot to say that OP's brother isn't using something other than weed. He obviously has a serious problem either way. But yes, weed can make you just incredibly sick, it can kill you, and you can spend thousands of dollars on it if you're young enough, naive enough, or desperate enough.", "The moody could be haha", "Yeah sounds like she's from some ohhlawd it's the devil's lettuce family. No one who's ever been around someone who uses weed would see aggressive behavior and think I bet they smoke weed.", "I think so too. Weed is cheap. He might be onto something else.", "Yeah that\u2019s definitely not cannabis! None of that fits the description of a stoner.\n\nSource: am a stoner.", "Fully agree, but also is an ounce a month really a lot? I smoke\u2026 significantly more than that\u2026", "If he's in high paying work I bet it's coke.", "or any type of high dollar opiate pill or heroin... meth is super cheap  here, heroin on the other hand isnt...", "Eh, meth isn\u2019t as expensive as coke. I\u2019m betting coke", "If it was just that he was smoking a lot of weed, it\u2019d be one thing, but he\u2019s getting into financial difficulty to asking his sibling for a loan. It\u2019s getting out of hand. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to confide in their parents, though perhaps after having a conversation with him in which you make clear that you\u2019re concerned for his wellbeing, and that if he comes to you asking for money again you\u2019re going to have to share it with them.", "That would be only if he was a big time dealer- and even still, only in some states. Otherwise, landlords would be screwed", "Your brother is full of it...fluctuating weight, weed makes you chunky if anything cuz your appetite is being triggered and you're only grumpy if you go days without on a normal high intake. \nThat being said weed also makes you sleepy/tired depending on the strain.\nThis sounds more like he's on narcotics and probably fentynal cux that's what's popular these days..\nMention the cost of aluminum foil being high to your mom and watch her say she spends a ton and goes through it quickly...that's your smoking gun.", "It's not a weed habbit, as others are saying. And lack of weed does not cause that type of situation you're describing. He's doing a harder drug, ran out, and owes someone money. Don't give it to him and ask if he's alright.", "is not weed, coke maybe or meth", "It's highly likely he's using something harder. Or, if it's still weed, it's not just weed. In the US even marijuana is being adulterated with other drugs. If he is using heavier drugs there's what he thinks he's using and what he is actually using as street drugs that aren't mixed with other substances are getting rare", "Do not help him. Change your locks and get cameras.\n\nAddicts when desperate get violent. Call the cops if you have to.", "It's not weed. Don't give him anything.", "100% not for cannabis. Former junkie here, this problem is deeper than that.", "He's not doing pot but something way harder sounds like he is into it bad. I think you need to let your parents know he's into something worse than pot and he needs help. I use pot regularly and don't act like that. Please don't give him money and let your parents know to watch out for their valuables. If you give him money you'll be enabling his habit. NTA", "As a former iv heroin and meth user, plus a heavy weed smoker.... This is not weed alone, I am sorry to say.", "Oooo thats a bad sign", "Definitely not a weed habit... i spend maybe $70 every two months on enough weed for 2 people, if that", "It's not weed or it is weed and he is dealing it in addition to smoking it.", "It's probably not weed. I'm inclined to say coke due to your description, but regardless... Don't give him money for his drug addiction. Also, while his drug habits shouldn't be something you bring up to your parents, this level of addiction would be a problem they will have to interact with on dome level and yes, you might want to warn them. If it's that bad, and he's already being shady, the next step is stealing, which absolutely will affect them.", "I live in Northern California, the weed culture is stronger here than almost anywhere else in the world. I spent years after high school smoking all day everyday and even worked in a dispensary, unless he is buying insanely overpriced weed, he isn't spending thousands month on bud.", "I was thinking more a loan to buy initial inventory but yeah if not - that too.", "Sorry, my comment about the rent was with respect to the relevance about him not paying to live there so his ability to make rent wouldn\u2019t be affected with him being short on funds.\n\nI see how it could have come off differently though.\n\nAnd I agree with you on all that you said here.", "Yeah white or brown.. \nor if not drugs - gambling", "> I mentioned the past because it brought up a huge fight and I wouldn't want to put my parents through that again\n\nWhatever he's addicted to is already causing noticeable health issues, with the weight gain and loss. It's also causing him to spend more money than he has.\n\nIf he hasn't begun stealing to support his addiction yet, he very likely will soon - if he doesn't OD first.\n\nDo you want your parents to have to go through *that*? Because that's what you're saying. You're saying you don't want to put your parents through a difficult conversation, so instead you're willing to let them watch your brother continue to spiral.", "> I think he is an adult who is responsible for his own decisions\n\nSure. And so are your parents, but you're not giving them information they need in order to make good decisions. They need to know what's going on with your brother so they can take steps to protect their valuables if it becomes necessary.", "It feels like it, when I used to smoke half that amount 10 years ago \ud83d\ude05", "My thoughts exactly.", "THIS.\nHe's NOT buying weed", "I was thinking this. Someone definitely can, but not without the people around you noticing. I don't see how you can go broke smoking weed while simultaneously living with people who have no clue you smoke weed.", "I am willing to demonstrate how a person can smoke two or three thousand dollars worth of weed in a month if you're willing to pony up the expense... like between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds of high grade SoCal bud.\n\n... in fact, this sounds like a fun video to make...", "Yeah I call bullshit I smoke weed everyday,  ounce a week probably shit doesn't cost 1000 dollars a month \n\n\nLike I'm not bragging it's disgusting how much i toke but shit doesn't cost 1000 dollars \n\nNot even half that much", "Snoop d o double g would beg to differ", "If he's a smoker, he may also have the problem of smoking his own product to sell, then not having enough to cover the cost of re-upping the inventory.  Smoked his profits away.\n\nBut even then... thousands is insane. He'd have to be buying straight concentrates.", "The money is hardly a little thing you can just handwave away like that.", "I used to have a psychological dependence on weed, I absolutely was moody and irritable especially when I wasn't high. The fluctuating weight does give me pause though, and the sheer amount he's spending", "Also, I know quite a few heavy duty potheads, but even they don't manage to spend *thousands* a month. Does he smoke his weed laced with gold dust?", "My brother was like this whenever he was back on his heroin bullshit and coming down off the high. Perfectly sweet guy when sober, but ugh, hard drugs don\u2019t do anyone any favors.", "Imo and experience weed teathing makes me miserable, moody and sharp. I'm working on that tho. Personal experience is you can grow a sort of \"dependency\" in it", "I wonder if he is smoking down and then ordering a bunch of expensive munchies. The only other thing I could think of was drinking heavily at the casino.", "Hahaha \nI\u2019ll take you at your word, sir", "It also wouldn't be possible to hide a weed habit that severe from parents he lives with. This is definitely something harder.", "No thay checks out too. Because of stronger and stronger strains as compared to like 20 or so years ago, side effects and withdrawal symptoms have been popping up.\n\nThrowing up happens to be one, no appetite, moodswings, etc. They aren't well known however.\n\nI read an article on how there was going to be a bigger study to look into this as already people are talking about this stuff happening to themself or someone one they know. [I also personally know someone where he goes through so many different symptoms when he doesn't smoke...so I'm just on the hunt for answers]", "My roommates' elderly dog gets cranky if she doesn't get to sit with us while we smoke", "It's me. The people you knew were me.", "My guess would be coke, kinda checks all the boxes.", "Weed cut with something by a dealer looking to create an addiction?", "ew. don\u2019t smoke around your pets.", "Me too bud me too", "Yep, was wondering if someone would name it.\n\nOf course, it's not the only option, but it's the most probable.", "CBD is just as good for them as us.", "and THC is toxic to them.", "Yeah but the THC is extremely toxic to them.", "We were giving our dog CBD supplements (periodically in stressful situations, not daily). Our vet told us to stop bc it can cause seizures in dogs.", "I had no idea about that! Never smoked round my pets (I think it's being rude towards them \ud83d\ude05)"]}
