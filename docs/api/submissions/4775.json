Their justification that you still enjoyed the experience it doesn't make them any less wrong for them misleading you by claiming to also participate topless then lie by not doong that after all. \n\n\nNTA", "Most certainly NTA. Your friends stabbed you in the back while you were exposing your front. Not only did they not have the guts to follow through with the plan you ALL agreed with, now they are continuing to mock you and recirculating photos. \n\nTo be honest, you probably need to start recognizing that these people are not your friends. They are being rude, insensitive, and juvenile, all at your expense. At least you now know that they can\u2019t be trusted, and that you can place no faith whatsoever in anything they say in the future. They\u2019ve shown you their true colors, so act accordingly and find some new (decent) mates for your next trip.", "NTA. This is so fucking insane. Who does that to their friend? No one.

Seems like your boyfriend wasn't the only one being abusive. That's just messed up.", "NTA. How funny a prank is is determined by the person on the receiving end. If they don't see the funny side, then it's a bad prank, and if your friends keep digging it up when they know how you feel about it, that's bullying. I'm sure their initial intentions weren't malicious, but they misjudged this and need to own their mistake and apologise.", "You agreed on the basis that you were all going topless. You were tricked and deceived in a rather nasty prank. Pranks are always mean-spirited and this one was too. You consented to one thing and they did another to thing you. That's *always* bad. \n\n>we agreed on a \u2018no holds barred, what goes on tour stays on tour\u2019 holiday. \n\nAnother example of how they didn't give a shit about what you consented to when they distributed and re-circulated the photo. \n\nAlso, you were in a vulnerable state after the break up. They took advantage of you wanting to cut loose after that and conspired to humiliate you and bullied you into taking the photo.\n\nThese people are awful. \n\nYou have *many* reasons here to be aggrieved. NTA\n\nReport the photo to whatever SM platform its on and consider reporting it to the police as revenge porn.

They are the AHs and you need to find better friends", "NTA \n\nThese people aren\u2019t your friends. This wasn\u2019t funny it was borderline abusive. I\u2019m so so sorry they did this to you OP.\n\nThe fact they\u2019re sharing the pics as well?? This is horrendous. I hope they grovel on their knees and if you never forgive them I would totally understand. This is just such a betrayal and a cruel cruel thing to do.", "This has layers upon layers.\n\n>Earlier in the year I split up with controlling ex.\n\nSo you were already feeling emotionally vulnerable after an abusive ex partner, which all of these friends knew about, I assume. \n\n>For a bit of added thrill we all agreed to do it topless. Organisers were ok with it. We did have to sign photo waivers (everyone does)but knew we\u2019d be muddy so unrecognisable and names wouldn\u2019t be on. *Also strength in numbers*. \n\nYou thought you could trust these friends and have a shared bonding experience, this must've felt particularly reassuring, knowing that you are all going to do this \"risky\" thing together. You were excited to share the moment with them. \n\n>I went first, and yes there were a lot of *photos* and cheers. \n\nUm, so what happened to these photos? Do your friends have these, or do strangers now have photos of your boobs because your friends thought it was hilarious to trick you, so only you were vulnerable? \n\n>It was only after they all started finishing, I saw they\u2019d kept their tops on! I was the only one that day!  For the team pic (after the ice bath so mud had washed off). I wanted to get my top but the lockers were far away and I stupidly agreed. So of 6 of us in the pic, only me exposed! \n\nThere is such a thing as peer pressure. Your \"friends\" had already humiliated you by making sure you were the only person who went topless, had lots of photos taken of their boobs, and been exposed to strangers *all because they lied* Also, in fight and flight responses, there is also freeze and faun. You could have frozen up or gone along with the photo because you were in shock, and flooded with adrenaline. \n\n>I was a bit upset, they thought it was hilarious and kept sharing pics on group chat (only us on this).\n\nWhy did they keep sharing pictures of your humiliation when they knew it upset you? They were basically throwing your humiliation in your face over and over again. \n\n>They said I was happy to do it and *wasn\u2019t coerced* and I\u2019d been involved in other wind ups on the others. True but this felt a bit worse.\n\nThey lied. They lied to push you to do something that you wouldn't have done otherwise. *That's  coercion*.\n\nSo they, knowing you had previously been manipulated by an ex, manipulated you into doing something you wouldn't have otherwise done through lies, yet can't understand that could clearly be traumatic, as you're experiencing similar behaviour from people you thought you could trust.\n\nI don't know what other \"pranks\" are played in your group, do they all involve humiliation and cruelty with a dash of gaslighting? If this is par for the course, and could have easily been one of the other women running topless then everyone needs to grow up and realise that this is mean spirited and immature, and will only cause resentment. \n\nIf the other \"pranks\" aren't this cruel to other group members, then you don't have friends, you have bullies.  \n\n>I did try googling pics and only found them several pages in, no names or anything.\n\nUnless the photos you're referring to are the ones of you running, it's the group photo that they agreed not to share, but obviously have, otherwise how are they on the internet? Only exception is if the person who took the group photo shared it online. \n\nYour bare boobs being online is because your \"friends\" tricked you into going topless btw, any photos of them totally covered by clothes doesn't make them vulnerable in the same way at all. Yet another way you've had control taken away from you. \n\n>One of group has just recirculated the team pic having photoshopped Santa hats on them an elf hat on me, and a cheeky Christmas message and I got a bit upset again and we had a row.  They said it had been a bit of fun I fully agreed to at the time and i was making a big deal of it because it hadn\u2019t been shared beyond the group. I don\u2019t believe it has TBF.\n\nYou only agreed because *they lied and manipulated you*.\n\nYou've explained that this photo is upsetting you, yet because they think being mean and manipulating others is hilarious they want to remind you of this horrible incident over and over, and constantly try and convince you that what you experienced wasn't real.\n\n1) You didn't want to do this\n\n2) They lied to manipulate you\n\n3) They're now trying to rewrite history and are pretending that you would have done the course topless even if they hadn't lied, which isn't true. They're trying to rewrite history. \n\n4) They think it's funny to reshare a photo you find upsetting because they enjoy your pain and discomfort \n\n5) At best, their behaviour is wildly immature and cruel. They need to learn that no means no. They need to sincerely apologise, stop sharing the picture - delete it from their phones and ask themselves why they'd rather laugh at the pain and discomfort of a friend rather than admit a mistake.\n\n6) The fact that everyone else in the photo got a santa hat, but you got an elf hat shows that they think of you as \"other\" not a part of the group. This is bullying 101.\n\nI used to have people like this in my life, and I'm a lot happier now I don't. Mean bullying isn't banter. Victimising someone, especially when they've recently been in an intimate abusive relationship is even more abhorrent. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "**NTA** \n\nTricking you into thinking all of you were going topless was bad enough \u2014 but now recirculating photos of you topless is really abusive behaviour. \n\nYou have a right to be mad!!", "NTA you kept your word ,they did not, I mean I am pretty sure if any of them went first & then turned out no one else did it after,  they would feel pretty betrayed also!", "NTA, time to find new friends", "NTA OP.
