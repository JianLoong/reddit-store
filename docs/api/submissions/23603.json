Keira and Isla have the same father, who is actively involved in their lives. However, Makayla\u2019s father is not at all involved and has actively denied her. Since she was 3 I\u2019ve tried to be a father figure to her. Not sure if I am.  \n\n\n  \nI always take my sons to go fishing on the weekends and do other activities that Laila is not interested in. I also do other things with all of the kids together, but never really a father-daughter day with just Laila.  \nI do have a weak heart for Laila, I\u2019ve never really told her no. So when she asked if we could have a father-daughter trip to Paris, I of course said yes. I told my wife and she was fine with it. I think Laila told Makayla about the trip to Paris. Makayla asked if she could also go on the trip with us. Laila said no, It\u2019s just a trip for my dad and me. Makayla then begged if she could also be on the trip, Laila said no and told her to go on a trip with her own father. Makayla was of course upset and went to her room to cry. My wife heard her and went to ask what happened.   \n\n\n  \nOf course, my wife is also upset and wants me to take Makayla on the trip as well. I asked Laila if she was okay with Makayla going with us and she said no absolutely not. Laila also said that Isla and Keira also go on a trip with their father and no one is upset, as well as her brothers going on a trip with just me and that isn\u2019t a problem. I kind of agree with Laila on that. My wife on the other hand will be very upset if I don\u2019t take Makayla on the trip with us.  \n\n\n  \nI asked my sister for advice and she said that it is unfair to exclude Makayla and that Laila can not always have her way. That I should take both or not have a trip at all. I\u2019ve also asked my ex-wife what she thought about the situation and she said that our kids should be my first priority and that it\u2019s unfair to Laila.

That's totally fine.\n\nHOWEVER- you do need to have a sit down, with a reasonable punishment, for Laila her telling Makayla \"to go on a trip with her own father.\" That wasn't okay and Laila is old enough to know better.\n\nThere is also no reason why Makayla can't have a trip of her own. Either with you or with her mom. Ideally that would have been planned in advance but you can fix it. Acknowledge that you guys didn't realize that everyone had a special trip planned but Makayla. Let her pick a place (within reason) that she wants to go to and which parent she wants to take her.\n\nParent/child time is important. Whether it's one on one or one on two. It's important. Remarriages don't change that. But it's also important to make sure that all of the kids are getting a version of the same experience.", "Easy solution. Offer to take M some place of her choice for 1 on 1 time. And take L to Paris. I understand where L is coming from and same with M. The best solution would be to do a one on one trip with them both", "Yta.  You say you have tried to be a father figure to maKayla since she was 3.  But have you really?  Sounds like you are only willing to be a father to her when it\u2019s pleases you and your own daughter.  For Laila to say to makayla to go on a trip with her own father knowing her own father has never been involved is a supremely shitty thing to say.  For that alone, she should not be rewarded with a trip to Paris.  You are raising an entitled brat and and quite frankly a very unkind human being if you allow her to get away with treating her stepsister that way.  Take both girls or don\u2019t go at all.", "Nah yet. Ask makayla if she\u2019d like to have her own father-daughter trip w you. And if you indeed see her as a daughter, tell her. Straighten up Laila while at it. Let her know yoh love maykala as much as her and that her comment was out of line and cruel.", "Than plan another trip with your other daughter.  She will get an alone trip next.  Don\u2019t make this a big thing.  Laila obviously needs time with you.", "NTA. Your bio daughter is entitled to one on one time with her father. Why does everyone else get to spend time with their dads, but your daughter doesn't?  I understand the SD has a deadbeat dad, but that isn't your daughter's fault. You brought your daughter into this world, she is your priority. You do something else with your SD.", "NTA yet.... But I think you need to take a long hard look at what kind of relationship you want with Makayla. I think taking the girls together is out of the picture at this point. You don't seem to be very strong when it comes to sticking up for Makayla and I am afraid this would be the worst vacation of her life. I think throwing them together for this trip would be a disaster. \n\nYes, Isla and Keira go on trips with THEIR father. It is clear that this girl is looking at you as a father figure. What kind of message do you want to leave her with? Talk to her and your current wife, your ex is an ex for a reason and won't have your best interest in this. Whereas, your sister has no skin in this game and probably has the best viewpoint. \n\nMy best advice is take Makayla somewhere special for the two of you and for god sake talk to the girl and let her know that she is important to you.", "NTA I think your ex wife is right. That your kids should be your first priority.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter needs this one on one time with you. She may be feeling a little neglected. She went from being the only girl to having to share you. Your sons still get that one on one bonding time.", "Yes YTA. you chose to be that girl's dad. You chose to be a father to all six children. This is a teachable moment for both girls. For L it's that she must compromise and for M it's that she has a man in her life that would not cast her aside. It's one of those moments that shapes who our children become. \n\nL will have a nice time regardless once she gets there. But this could well be a defining moment for M. She probably already feels insecure about her bio dad tossing her aside. Do you want to do the same?", "YTA and had Laila not said what she said to Makayla, I may have said NTA, but man that girl needs to get some manners and empathy. If Makayla sees you as her dad, which is kind of sounds like she does since you\u2019ve raised her since she was 3, you should take her or at least plan a trip with her . Her situation isn\u2019t like the others and it sounds like you are the only dad she\u2019s ever known. I don\u2019t know, I feel badly for her.", "The trip was planned for you and Laila at Laila's request. You can do another trip another time with Makayla. Just, be sure to actually do so. It's healthy for kids to have the undivided attention of their parent in a household full of siblings.  NTA based on all of it together.  But do call down Laila over her nastiness toward Makayla. You are effectively the only Dad Makayla has, there's no call for her to be cruel.", "Frankly ESH except for Makayla\n\nI understand wanting one on one time with Laila, but Paris, really? There are other less extravagant ways to have daddy daughter time. \n\nLaila for saying what she said and excluding Makayla when she knows her bio dad isn\u2019t involved and you\u2019re her father figure. \n\nAnd finally, your wife - look I get she wants Makayla included (and a trip to Paris? I get it) however Laila should also be able to have one on one time with you without having to compete for your attention. \n\nYou can absolutely do this trip with Laila and not include Makayla but be prepared for it to negatively affect your marriage as well as your relationship with Makayla", "YTA. \n\nThe Paris trip sounds ridiculously extravagant for only 1 child out of 6. \n\nYou do activities with both boys, and consider the 2:1 time sufficient. \n\nYou have parented Mikayla full time since she was 10, but presumably were at least partly involved since she was 8. \n\nWhy does she get excluded from your 2:1 boy time. You only mention that Laila doesn\u2019t enjoy their activities - so presumably she would be welcome if she wanted to join - is Mikayla even invited to those?\n\nLaila\u2019s cruelty to Mikayla should mean the Paris trip is cancelled. She gloated over being taken on the trip and also over having a bio-dad. That\u2019s incredibly mean. \n\nWhy would you reward her bullying by *asking her* if you were allowed to invite Mikayla? Who is the parent here? \n\nUnfortunately with the bullying not resolved, it probably won\u2019t be a good idea to take both girls on a 2:1 trip (potentially to someone cheaper if you cannot afford both girls to go) - otherwise that would be the logical answer. \n\nUltimately YTA for not dealing with the bullying effectively, and also for being dishonest about \u201ctrying to be a dad to Mikayla\u201d for the last 4-6 years. \n\nYou talk about your sons and Laila with the fishing weekends. You say that *Laila* deserves a 1:1 daddy-daughter thing. No where in any of that do you mention Mikayla. Which makes it sound like you don\u2019t consider her your child.", "Why don't you take Laila on a trip and have Makayla plan her own trip with you?", "YTA. Why are you not treating all your kids the same. This includes your son and your daughters. You say you take your sons fishing on weekends but make no attempt to do anything with either of your daughters? YTA for that alone. If Laila wants a trip with just her dad thats fair enough especially after watching her brothers always having guy time, but her comment to Makayla was not ok and there needs to be consequences for it. Make sure Makayla gets a trip too as in her eyes your are the only father figure shes ever had, so treat your daughters the same. And overall just be a better dad to your daughters in general.", "YTA", "| Since she was 3 I\u2019ve tried to be a father figure to her.\n\nNot like this you aren't. Take your daughters to Paris. Otherwise, YWBTA.", "30 years from now, you\u2019re going to have a medical emergency and Laila will call Makayla and say, Dad needs our help. And Makayla will say, you both made it pretty clear I don\u2019t have a dad. And you\u2019ll both be shocked she won\u2019t help. \nThis is why. Shame on you. YTA", "If the next trip you have planned is a trip to Paris with Makayla then it\u2019s fine, but it doesn\u2019t really sound like it. YTA.", "NTA because she asked and was told no and that should be respected - your daughter deserves just dad and her time.\n\nBut you really need to talk to Laila about why what she said to Mikayla was wrong, because she knows she doesn\u2019t have a father to do things with and that was uncalled for.", "NTA.   This is not a family vacation, it is a father/daughter trip.   If your wife feels like Makayla is left out, she should plan a trip with her.\n\nBut curious as to why Laila doesn\u2019t want Makayla to go, do they not get along?", "I'm going to go with NTA, but you are literally stuck between the proverbial \"rock and a hard place\".  On the one hand, if you don't take Makayla, you risk alienating her and putting undue hardship on your marriage.  On the other, if you do take Makayla, you risk potentially ruining your relationship with Laila.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat Laila said to Makayla after she begged to go on the trip is beyond being reprehensible.  I think everyone here agrees to that.  It was cold and cruel and not something that she should be saying to her step-sister.  Especially knowing that Makayla's biological father actively denies her existence.  Clearly the two do not get along well, and I wonder if Laila was telling Makayla about the trip to essentially \"rub it in\" that you two were planning on this wonderful trip to Paris.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, Makayla does need to learn when someone says no, that it's not an invitation to keep badgering them about it.  Laila **does** deserve to have time with you where she doesn't have to vie for your attention with her siblings.  I'm not sure that a trip to Paris is exactly appropriate for that, but that's not for me to decide.  It's your family and your choice.  I can only give my opinion.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can understand your ex-wife's perspective in that you should place your kids first, but when you married your current wife, you also took on those kids knowing full well that you were planning on being a father figure for them.  (Or at least to Makayla.)  Your current wife needs to understand, though, that your kids also need to have time by themselves with you without having her children around.  She shouldn't be placing pressure on you to take Makayla with you when there's no reason why you can't take another trip with her, alone, later.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould you choose to take Makayla on this trip, you will need to sit down with Makayla and your wife together and explain that if you do this and she goes on the trip, the next \"daddy-daughter\" trip that you take with Makayla will **have to** involve Laila as well.  It just wouldn't be fair otherwise (and it sounds like you want to do what is deemed most \"fair\" to everyone involved).  I would also make it abundantly clear that this would not be up for discussion, either.  If Makayla goes now, Laila goes later.  Period.  Vice versa applies too.  If Makayla does not go now, Laila does not go later.  Period.  If you do wind up taking Makayla and Laila finds out that you went on a trip with Makayla later on solo, you can kiss your relationship with Laila goodbye (and rightfully so).  You betrayed her at that point and that kind of betrayal isn't lightly forgiven.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I would have a sit down with Laila and explain that a trip to Paris would be wonderful, however, if she is insistent on Makayla not attending, that she will need to choose a different place to visit so that you can also have money to take a trip with her sister that she didn't want attending.  That she will have to compromise on something, somewhere.  Either her sister goes now and you all 3 go to Paris, or she stays home and Laila and yourself go somewhere more appropriate (for lack of a better word) for a visit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I certainly don't envy your position, OP.  No matter what you choose, someone is going to get hurt.  Just do the best you can to minimize the damage.", "All the parents here are AH    Poor Makayla seems to get nothing special from anyone.", "I want to say NTA but wether or not Mikayla views you as a father figure that is the role you took on by marrying her mother; on the one hand Laila should be entitled to her own father-daughter trip/thing and her indignation at the possibility of Mikayla basically shoehorning herself into her trip sounds justified on the surface, but what she told her about her father was way over the line whether or not he was absent.\n\nThen on the other hand it does not sound justified from your perspective, why doesn\u2019t Mikayla deserve a father-daughter trip? You said yourself you\u2019ve been trying to be a father figure to her, since before she could remember, that should go even when things are tough, shouldn\u2019t it? \n\nI don\u2019t know your money situation but morally speaking I\u2019d say the best thing to do would be to go on two separate trips; seeing as this isn\u2019t possible for just anyone the next sensible option is for Laila to swallow the pill and have a joint trip, IMO having a father-daughter thing more like her brothers\u2019 fishing trips is the fair thing, not a trip to Paris.\n\n I think your ex-wife has your priorities distorted; you\u2019re sharing a life with another woman, who has a child which you from your description helped raise since she was 3 years old; you can\u2019t just dismiss that with blood relations.\n\nI think Mikayla isn\u2019t TA for her expectations, is TA for what she said, your Ex-wife is TA for making you prioritize her daughter over your CURRENT WIFE\u2019S DAUGHTER, to be clear, both are yours.

While you're a father figure to Makayla, you're not her actual father. Spending time with just your sons but taking your stepdaughter on a father-daughter vacation tells Laila that it's not as important to spend time with her as it is to spend time with your sons.\n\nYou told Laila you'd take her to Paris, just her. It's no longer a father-daughter trip when you add another person.\n\nWhile I'm sure your wife would prefer you take Makayla, she said it was fine until M begged to go. Your wife of 4 yrs can't expect your daughter to want to include M in her trip.", "NTA, your daughter asked for a trip with only you, if you take Makayla she will never forgive you and probs go no contact. Is not worth it to ruin your relationship with your daughter to please a wife", "NTA .. it\u2019s clear just from her comment that she\u2019s feeling threatened for some reason. She\u2019s insecure and wants to spend some time with just you. Maybe Paris isn\u2019t appropriate. Maybe someplace else is better.

Laila doesn\u2019t want to share her dad on their trip and she shouldn\u2019t have to. \n\n OP and his wife should take Makayla on a separate trip to her choice of destination.", "Laila is obviously spoiled and has shitty role models.", "I think Makayla feels intimidated by Laila. Makayla is very quiet and keeps to herself. Laila is the complete opposite. Very outspoken, Laila will tell what's on her mind, regardless of if it hurts the other's feelings or not. It is something I'm working on with Laila.", "She shouldn\u2019t have to ask for that. You\u2019re the parent. Now that you know she wants to go on a trip with you, you should ask her to think of places she wants to go and you\u2019ll take care of the rest. You\u2019re NTA for wanting a solo trip with Laila but as the father you have a responsibility to make sure all your kids feel equally loved.", "Wow. This is why YTA.", "Why don\u2019t you plan a one on one with Makayla?\n\nAsk her if she would like this and where would she want to go?\n\nPlan it with her and let her know her input is important to you \n\nNTA but your daughter is", "Why don\u2019t you ask her?", "Your daughter was a straight up shitty person. She shouldn't be rewarded with a trip. You should take Makayla instead of laila", "Why does your stepdaughter, who you live with, get more consideration from you than your daughter? \n\nYou spend your weekends with your sons and poor Layla is shoved off to the side and you focus on Makayla. If Layla doesn't like her it's because she's not getting any of your attention. Taking Makayla on a trip will further diminish your relationship with Layla", "And if Laila asked to tag along or threw a fit about it?", "\"Not sure if I am.\"\n\nBased on this response I would say that would be a NO............but you could be.\n\nBy the example your daughter provided she might not think she can.\n\nYou might have to show the initiative.  That is if you care.", "Your kids shouldn't have to ask for one on one time with their parent. Your own biological daughter had to ask you for it since you couldn't be bothered to want to on your own. Try actually liking your kids.", "Ruining layla's trip with her dad won't change that.", "What she said was so heinous she deserves to have the trip taken away as punishment.", "Plus he see l every other weekend. He lives with m. He does daily things with m. How much does op really get to do with L.", "And her father doesn\u2019t love her.", "Don\u2019t make excuses for Laila. What she said is not an example of someone saying what\u2019s on their mind. She was being unnecessarily cruel to a member of her family. If she had my parents, she wouldn\u2019t be going to Paris after making a remark like that.", "Not doing a very good job.", "OP\u2019s sons don\u2019t get one on one trips with their dad. Why should Laila? He\u2019s the only father figure Makayla has so it makes sense for both girls to go on the trip.", "So Laila is a bully?", "You don't spend time with Layla and live in the same house as Makayla. Absolutely don't let Ms jealousy ruin Ls trip.\n\nHere the problem is that your wife didn't go after Makayla's dad for paternity or child support. She is the one who had a child with a deadbeat and while it was wrong for Layla to bring that up,  it's equally wrong for Makayla to try to go along on your daughter's trip and wrong for your wife to expect that", "I think you need to work with both girls. Laila needs to earn her trip back because she was intentionally cruel, and feels no remorse. Do not reward her behavior. But give her the opportunity to correct her behavior. \n\nMakayla also deserves to feel special and not just tolerate abuse from your bully of daughter. While it would be nice if Laila would share her trip, I don\u2019t think Laila has the capacity to be a decent travel partner to Makayla. \n\nI think you should be the father-figure Makayla needs - offer to do a one on one trip. Waiting for Makayla to suggest it is a cop out. Makayla as you say your daughter intimidates (aka bullies) your stepdaughter. Stop enabling Laila\u2019s hatefulness. Start showing Makayla that she is valued and that you are her parent too\u2026 give her a chance to feel special.", "Right it sounds Like she's shy and quiet.I know I would have a hard time asking myself especially after being asked to go to Paris and being rejected.", "His bio daughter had to ask.", "What makes you think Laila is shoved to the side in favor of Makayla? It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening at all.", "I think you have the names mixed up. \n\nLaila is the bio daughter.\n\nMykayla is the step-daughter.", "We don\u2019t know that he does daily things with Makayla. Just because they live in the same house full time doesn\u2019t mean that OP is a hands on dad to Makayla.", "That's neither OP nor Layla's problem. OP is nor Makayla's father.", "OP stated that he takes his sons fishing every weekend and the only time he spends with Laila is if it\u2019s with her brothers as he doesn\u2019t have any activities to do alone with Laila. So Laila absolutely deserves to spend time alone with her dad just as her brothers do. \n \nOP said he sees his kids on the weekends so that means Laila lives with her mom and Makayla lives with her stepdad (Laila\u2019s dad). \n\nIt\u2019s unfair that Laila only sees her dad on weekends, doesn\u2019t spend one-on-one time with him, yet Makayla who lives with him wants to join on Laila\u2019s trip with dad.\n\nHow do you not see a problem with this?", "calling her jealous when his daughter said something out of line to his step-daughter is insane. his daughter needs to be talked to, wanting one on one time with her dad is one thing. she literally threw it in her step-sisters face that she doesnt have a dad. you dont tear people down in order to stick up for yourself. you do that when you\u2019re inconsiderate & rude.", "His stepdaughter asked to join them. Both girls made a request that indicates they want to go on a father/daughter trip. Now that OP knows that, he should plan a trip with each of them.", "Makayla lives with OP, he spends weekends focused on his boys. Laila asking for a trip and both Makayla and her mom demand she go on Layla's trip, or OP take her on her own trip, which would likely include a weekend and just takes more time away from Layla, when OP spends more time with Makayla in the first place", "No. Laila is getting shoved aside for Makayla, with whom OP lives. OP admits to rarely spending time with Laila as he focuses on his sons on weekends. Laila asked for a one on one trip and now OPs wife thinks he should take her daughter, who asked to join and wouldn't give it up, no wonder Laila snapped.\n\nI bet OPs wife overcompensates for M not having her father in her life", "Even if he is home every evening and having dinner with M everyday that is still more than op\u2019s daughter and sons get. They get 4 days a month with their dad.", "He\u2019s as good as. That\u2019s what you sign on for with being a stepparent to a kid with a deadbeat parent.", "Then boys don\u2019t get one on one time with their dad either. That\u2019s the point. Laila would be getting something that none of the other kids get.", "We don't know what kind of relationship the girls have so I'm not going to assume Layla made the comment out of nowhere. That's the part OP knows about but there's usually more. \n\nWhat we do know is that Makayla spends more time with OP than Laila does and wants to join Lailas trip.", "Living together doesn\u2019t mean she gets special alone time with him. Weekdays are busy.\nHow come all the other kids get a special trip with their dads and she gets nothing?", "I lived with my dad full time and I didn\u2019t have any one on one time with him during the week. I spent time with him on the weekends but I had to share that time with my mom and my sister. Just because he lives with Makayla doesn\u2019t mean he spends one on one time with her.", "OP appears to disagree as he said he tried to be a father figure to M, not a father.", "Laila is getting something that her brothers get that she does not. He spends time with his boys every week. Makayla lives with him. Laila deserves this trip with her dad. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "you dont know that though, he even said she\u2019s quiet &  reserved. he only mentioned doing one on one with his sons because his sons are interested in what he does as in fishing. regardless of their relationship, she had no place to say that & its pretty obvious makayla isnt the one who, \u201cwill tell whats on her mind.\u201d he said that himself. layla could\u2019ve easily told her she would rather it just be her & her dad, but she decided to be cruel. stop trying to excuse a cruel comment made just because he has excuses for her behavior as is.", "It means she spends more time with him than his kids do.\n\nWhy doesn't her mom take her on a trip? \n\nOP isn't her dad. Taking her on Laila\"s trip shortchanges Laila, again.", "I said he spent more time with her, I never said it was one on one time. He's not Makayla's father, her mother should take her on a trip since she's the one who picked an uninvolved person.", "I don\u2019t really see the difference, aside from the orgasm 15 years ago.", "Her brothers share their dad during the fishing trip. What\u2019s wrong with her sharing her dad with her stepsister?", "We don't know the dynamics between the girls. Makayla had balls to think she should join a father daughter trip that she wasn't invited on.", "It\u2019s not the same kind of time. His focus likely isn\u2019t on her and making the day special for her. It\u2019s getting out the door to work and school, homework, extracurriculars, house chores, dinner, bedtime. \n\nMakayla is hurt that all the other kids are getting a dad trip. A mom trip won\u2019t help. Makayla is the junky burden kid whose dad doesn\u2019t love her. \n\nOP is as good a dad as she\u2019s going to get. Plenty of people view stepparents as their parents. That\u2019s what you sign on for when you have a step kid with a deadbeat parent.", "First of all, OP is Makayla\u2019s father. He\u2019s been in her life since she was 3 years old. Her bio dad is not on the picture so OP has been filling the role. Biology is irrelevant here. Second, my point still stands. Most people don\u2019t get to spend time with their parents during the week because it\u2019s all about school and work. Makayla is probably just as much in need of time with OP as Laila is.", "If he felt like a father to M, he wouldn't get his exs opinion, he'd have offered a trip to her. Since his wife suggested taking M on a trip only after M was told no multiple times about joining Layla's trip.\n\nI think Ms mom has done her a disservice; it doesn't seem like she sued for paternity or child support, which I realize are no substitute for being involved in her life but it seems.like her mom did nothing to prove paternity which may have resulted in a relationship with grandparents", "Makayla lives with OP. Why should Laila have to share her dad on her time?", "maybe because they\u2019ve been a blended family since they were kids. & they still are kids, so why are you hostile ? she doesnt need balls to consider them her family. so maybe you need to take a breath friend.", "Makayla still gets more time with OP than his daughter does. \n\nM's hurt is something due to circumstances; the bottom line is she doesn't have a dad and OP is going to damage his relationship with his own daughter if he takes Makayla on her own trip; he said himself that he has tried to be a father figure, which isn't the same as a father. \n\nOP doesn't see her as a daughter though, or himself as her father or he'd have said. He didn't offer M a trip of her own, his wife suggested it, so clearly, he doesn't see M as his own.", "OP isn't her father. \n\nMost people talk to their parents while dinner is cooking and at the dinner table, while watching shows, etc. \n\nLaila doesn't get time with her dad.", "Living together doesn\u2019t mean special alone time or special trips. All the other kids get a special trip. She gets just the everyday. \n\nShe\u2019s going to feel like she doesn\u2019t deserve the love that comes with a special trip.\n\nWhen you become a stepdad to a kid who doesn\u2019t have a dad, you\u2019re signing up to be a father figure. That means giving Makayla the same special trips Laila gets.", "They're still kids. The narrative doesn't indicate when the kids met, just that OP has known M since 3. \n\nM asked if she could join Laila's trip, then wouldn't take no for an answer. \n\nI didnt say she had balls to consider them family but to think she could join Lailas trip.", "If you\u2019re not prepared to see the child of your spouse with a deadbeat parent as your child too, don\u2019t date people with kids", "That special trip is for OP to spend time with Laila because he hasn\u2019t been able to bond with her the way he has with his sons. \n\nMakayla gets daily access to her stepfather, Laila is not able to spend as much time with her dad. OP becoming a stepfather does not mean that he has to take his stepdaughter on special trips with his daughter. OP can plan another trip with Makayla if he wants to spend one on one time with her. The trip to Paris is Laila\u2019s time.", "its pretty obvious its been years since they met, he literally mentioned when he met his step daughter & im pretty sure his kids were around then or sometime around then. it still doesnt excuse what she said, so honestly what you say still doesnt excuse nor explain her cruel behavior. if makayla was that bad, layla could have involved their parents or said or did anything else other than that. have a good night."]}
