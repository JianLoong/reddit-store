Keira and Isla have the same father, who is actively involved in their lives. However, Makayla\u2019s father is not at all involved and has actively denied her. Since she was 3 I\u2019ve tried to be a father figure to her. Not sure if I am.  \n\n\n  \nI always take my sons to go fishing on the weekends and do other activities that Laila is not interested in. I also do other things with all of the kids together, but never really a father-daughter day with just Laila.  \nI do have a weak heart for Laila, I\u2019ve never really told her no. So when she asked if we could have a father-daughter trip to Paris, I of course said yes. I told my wife and she was fine with it. I think Laila told Makayla about the trip to Paris. Makayla asked if she could also go on the trip with us. Laila said no, It\u2019s just a trip for my dad and me. Makayla then begged if she could also be on the trip, Laila said no and told her to go on a trip with her own father. Makayla was of course upset and went to her room to cry. My wife heard her and went to ask what happened.   \n\n\n  \nOf course, my wife is also upset and wants me to take Makayla on the trip as well. I asked Laila if she was okay with Makayla going with us and she said no absolutely not. Laila also said that Isla and Keira also go on a trip with their father and no one is upset, as well as her brothers going on a trip with just me and that isn\u2019t a problem. I kind of agree with Laila on that. My wife on the other hand will be very upset if I don\u2019t take Makayla on the trip with us.  \n\n\n  \nI asked my sister for advice and she said that it is unfair to exclude Makayla and that Laila can not always have her way. That I should take both or not have a trip at all. I\u2019ve also asked my ex-wife what she thought about the situation and she said that our kids should be my first priority and that it\u2019s unfair to Laila.

That's totally fine.\n\nHOWEVER- you do need to have a sit down, with a reasonable punishment, for Laila her telling Makayla \"to go on a trip with her own father.\" That wasn't okay and Laila is old enough to know better.\n\nThere is also no reason why Makayla can't have a trip of her own. Either with you or with her mom. Ideally that would have been planned in advance but you can fix it. Acknowledge that you guys didn't realize that everyone had a special trip planned but Makayla. Let her pick a place (within reason) that she wants to go to and which parent she wants to take her.\n\nParent/child time is important. Whether it's one on one or one on two. It's important. Remarriages don't change that. But it's also important to make sure that all of the kids are getting a version of the same experience.", "Easy solution. Offer to take M some place of her choice for 1 on 1 time. And take L to Paris. I understand where L is coming from and same with M. The best solution would be to do a one on one trip with them both", "Yta.  You say you have tried to be a father figure to maKayla since she was 3.  But have you really?  Sounds like you are only willing to be a father to her when it\u2019s pleases you and your own daughter.  For Laila to say to makayla to go on a trip with her own father knowing her own father has never been involved is a supremely shitty thing to say.  For that alone, she should not be rewarded with a trip to Paris.  You are raising an entitled brat and and quite frankly a very unkind human being if you allow her to get away with treating her stepsister that way.  Take both girls or don\u2019t go at all.", "Nah yet. Ask makayla if she\u2019d like to have her own father-daughter trip w you. And if you indeed see her as a daughter, tell her. Straighten up Laila while at it. Let her know yoh love maykala as much as her and that her comment was out of line and cruel.", "Than plan another trip with your other daughter.  She will get an alone trip next.  Don\u2019t make this a big thing.  Laila obviously needs time with you.", "NTA. Your bio daughter is entitled to one on one time with her father. Why does everyone else get to spend time with their dads, but your daughter doesn't?  I understand the SD has a deadbeat dad, but that isn't your daughter's fault. You brought your daughter into this world, she is your priority. You do something else with your SD.", "NTA yet.... But I think you need to take a long hard look at what kind of relationship you want with Makayla. I think taking the girls together is out of the picture at this point. You don't seem to be very strong when it comes to sticking up for Makayla and I am afraid this would be the worst vacation of her life. I think throwing them together for this trip would be a disaster. \n\nYes, Isla and Keira go on trips with THEIR father. It is clear that this girl is looking at you as a father figure. What kind of message do you want to leave her with? Talk to her and your current wife, your ex is an ex for a reason and won't have your best interest in this. Whereas, your sister has no skin in this game and probably has the best viewpoint. \n\nMy best advice is take Makayla somewhere special for the two of you and for god sake talk to the girl and let her know that she is important to you.", "NTA I think your ex wife is right. That your kids should be your first priority.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter needs this one on one time with you. She may be feeling a little neglected. She went from being the only girl to having to share you. Your sons still get that one on one bonding time.", "Yes YTA. you chose to be that girl's dad. You chose to be a father to all six children. This is a teachable moment for both girls. For L it's that she must compromise and for M it's that she has a man in her life that would not cast her aside. It's one of those moments that shapes who our children become. \n\nL will have a nice time regardless once she gets there. But this could well be a defining moment for M. She probably already feels insecure about her bio dad tossing her aside. Do you want to do the same?", "YTA and had Laila not said what she said to Makayla, I may have said NTA, but man that girl needs to get some manners and empathy. If Makayla sees you as her dad, which is kind of sounds like she does since you\u2019ve raised her since she was 3, you should take her or at least plan a trip with her . Her situation isn\u2019t like the others and it sounds like you are the only dad she\u2019s ever known. I don\u2019t know, I feel badly for her.", "The trip was planned for you and Laila at Laila's request. You can do another trip another time with Makayla. Just, be sure to actually do so. It's healthy for kids to have the undivided attention of their parent in a household full of siblings.  NTA based on all of it together.  But do call down Laila over her nastiness toward Makayla. You are effectively the only Dad Makayla has, there's no call for her to be cruel.", "Frankly ESH except for Makayla\n\nI understand wanting one on one time with Laila, but Paris, really? There are other less extravagant ways to have daddy daughter time. \n\nLaila for saying what she said and excluding Makayla when she knows her bio dad isn\u2019t involved and you\u2019re her father figure. \n\nAnd finally, your wife - look I get she wants Makayla included (and a trip to Paris? I get it) however Laila should also be able to have one on one time with you without having to compete for your attention. \n\nYou can absolutely do this trip with Laila and not include Makayla but be prepared for it to negatively affect your marriage as well as your relationship with Makayla", "YTA. \n\nThe Paris trip sounds ridiculously extravagant for only 1 child out of 6. \n\nYou do activities with both boys, and consider the 2:1 time sufficient. \n\nYou have parented Mikayla full time since she was 10, but presumably were at least partly involved since she was 8. \n\nWhy does she get excluded from your 2:1 boy time. You only mention that Laila doesn\u2019t enjoy their activities - so presumably she would be welcome if she wanted to join - is Mikayla even invited to those?\n\nLaila\u2019s cruelty to Mikayla should mean the Paris trip is cancelled. She gloated over being taken on the trip and also over having a bio-dad. That\u2019s incredibly mean. \n\nWhy would you reward her bullying by *asking her* if you were allowed to invite Mikayla? Who is the parent here? \n\nUnfortunately with the bullying not resolved, it probably won\u2019t be a good idea to take both girls on a 2:1 trip (potentially to someone cheaper if you cannot afford both girls to go) - otherwise that would be the logical answer. \n\nUltimately YTA for not dealing with the bullying effectively, and also for being dishonest about \u201ctrying to be a dad to Mikayla\u201d for the last 4-6 years. \n\nYou talk about your sons and Laila with the fishing weekends. You say that *Laila* deserves a 1:1 daddy-daughter thing. No where in any of that do you mention Mikayla. Which makes it sound like you don\u2019t consider her your child.", "Why don't you take Laila on a trip and have Makayla plan her own trip with you?", "YTA. Why are you not treating all your kids the same. This includes your son and your daughters. You say you take your sons fishing on weekends but make no attempt to do anything with either of your daughters? YTA for that alone. If Laila wants a trip with just her dad thats fair enough especially after watching her brothers always having guy time, but her comment to Makayla was not ok and there needs to be consequences for it. Make sure Makayla gets a trip too as in her eyes your are the only father figure shes ever had, so treat your daughters the same. And overall just be a better dad to your daughters in general.", "YTA", "| Since she was 3 I\u2019ve tried to be a father figure to her.\n\nNot like this you aren't. Take your daughters to Paris. Otherwise, YWBTA.", "30 years from now, you\u2019re going to have a medical emergency and Laila will call Makayla and say, Dad needs our help. And Makayla will say, you both made it pretty clear I don\u2019t have a dad. And you\u2019ll both be shocked she won\u2019t help. \nThis is why. Shame on you. YTA", "If the next trip you have planned is a trip to Paris with Makayla then it\u2019s fine, but it doesn\u2019t really sound like it. YTA.", "NTA because she asked and was told no and that should be respected - your daughter deserves just dad and her time.\n\nBut you really need to talk to Laila about why what she said to Mikayla was wrong, because she knows she doesn\u2019t have a father to do things with and that was uncalled for.", "NTA.   This is not a family vacation, it is a father/daughter trip.   If your wife feels like Makayla is left out, she should plan a trip with her.\n\nBut curious as to why Laila doesn\u2019t want Makayla to go, do they not get along?", "I'm going to go with NTA, but you are literally stuck between the proverbial \"rock and a hard place\".  On the one hand, if you don't take Makayla, you risk alienating her and putting undue hardship on your marriage.  On the other, if you do take Makayla, you risk potentially ruining your relationship with Laila.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat Laila said to Makayla after she begged to go on the trip is beyond being reprehensible.  I think everyone here agrees to that.  It was cold and cruel and not something that she should be saying to her step-sister.  Especially knowing that Makayla's biological father actively denies her existence.  Clearly the two do not get along well, and I wonder if Laila was telling Makayla about the trip to essentially \"rub it in\" that you two were planning on this wonderful trip to Paris.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, Makayla does need to learn when someone says no, that it's not an invitation to keep badgering them about it.  Laila **does** deserve to have time with you where she doesn't have to vie for your attention with her siblings.  I'm not sure that a trip to Paris is exactly appropriate for that, but that's not for me to decide.  It's your family and your choice.  I can only give my opinion.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can understand your ex-wife's perspective in that you should place your kids first, but when you married your current wife, you also took on those kids knowing full well that you were planning on being a father figure for them.  (Or at least to Makayla.)  Your current wife needs to understand, though, that your kids also need to have time by themselves with you without having her children around.  She shouldn't be placing pressure on you to take Makayla with you when there's no reason why you can't take another trip with her, alone, later.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould you choose to take Makayla on this trip, you will need to sit down with Makayla and your wife together and explain that if you do this and she goes on the trip, the next \"daddy-daughter\" trip that you take with Makayla will **have to** involve Laila as well.  It just wouldn't be fair otherwise (and it sounds like you want to do what is deemed most \"fair\" to everyone involved).  I would also make it abundantly clear that this would not be up for discussion, either.  If Makayla goes now, Laila goes later.  Period.  Vice versa applies too.  If Makayla does not go now, Laila does not go later.  Period.  If you do wind up taking Makayla and Laila finds out that you went on a trip with Makayla later on solo, you can kiss your relationship with Laila goodbye (and rightfully so).  You betrayed her at that point and that kind of betrayal isn't lightly forgiven.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I would have a sit down with Laila and explain that a trip to Paris would be wonderful, however, if she is insistent on Makayla not attending, that she will need to choose a different place to visit so that you can also have money to take a trip with her sister that she didn't want attending.  That she will have to compromise on something, somewhere.  Either her sister goes now and you all 3 go to Paris, or she stays home and Laila and yourself go somewhere more appropriate (for lack of a better word) for a visit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I certainly don't envy your position, OP.  No matter what you choose, someone is going to get hurt.  Just do the best you can to minimize the damage.", "All the parents here are AH    Poor Makayla seems to get nothing special from anyone.", "I want to say NTA but wether or not Mikayla views you as a father figure that is the role you took on by marrying her mother; on the one hand Laila should be entitled to her own father-daughter trip/thing and her indignation at the possibility of Mikayla basically shoehorning herself into her trip sounds justified on the surface, but what she told her about her father was way over the line whether or not he was absent.\n\nThen on the other hand it does not sound justified from your perspective, why doesn\u2019t Mikayla deserve a father-daughter trip? You said yourself you\u2019ve been trying to be a father figure to her, since before she could remember, that should go even when things are tough, shouldn\u2019t it? \n\nI don\u2019t know your money situation but morally speaking I\u2019d say the best thing to do would be to go on two separate trips; seeing as this isn\u2019t possible for just anyone the next sensible option is for Laila to swallow the pill and have a joint trip, IMO having a father-daughter thing more like her brothers\u2019 fishing trips is the fair thing, not a trip to Paris.\n\n I think your ex-wife has your priorities distorted; you\u2019re sharing a life with another woman, who has a child which you from your description helped raise since she was 3 years old; you can\u2019t just dismiss that with blood relations.\n\nI think Mikayla isn\u2019t TA for her expectations, is TA for what she said, your Ex-wife is TA for making you prioritize her daughter over your CURRENT WIFE\u2019S DAUGHTER, to be clear, both are yours.

While you're a father figure to Makayla, you're not her actual father. Spending time with just your sons but taking your stepdaughter on a father-daughter vacation tells Laila that it's not as important to spend time with her as it is to spend time with your sons.\n\nYou told Laila you'd take her to Paris, just her. It's no longer a father-daughter trip when you add another person.\n\nWhile I'm sure your wife would prefer you take Makayla, she said it was fine until M begged to go. Your wife of 4 yrs can't expect your daughter to want to include M in her trip.", "NTA, your daughter asked for a trip with only you, if you take Makayla she will never forgive you and probs go no contact. Is not worth it to ruin your relationship with your daughter to please a wife", "NTA .. it\u2019s clear just from her comment that she\u2019s feeling threatened for some reason. She\u2019s insecure and wants to spend some time with just you. Maybe Paris isn\u2019t appropriate. Maybe someplace else is better.

If this is you treat Makayla than your wife needs to protect her from you and your daughter. If she needs to do that than you all need to divorce so she doesn\u2019t have to be around you.

Laila isn\u2019t asking for anything that others in the family haven\u2019t already had - no reason she should have to share her trip with Makayla. \n\nThe best option is probably for Makayla to get her own trip, with her mother. Of course you could take her on one, but if you\u2019re not sure whether she actually sees you as her dad then I\u2019m less sure about that, since it might be Paris that\u2019s the interest for her here and not going with you specifically.", "NTA if you take Makayla on a separate trip of her own", "NTA", "I think overall NTA for not bringing your stepdaughter, but if you consider yourself her father I would offer to go on a father-daughter activity of similar emotional value another time. \n\nWhat your daughter said to Makayla is wrong and she should experience some consequences, but cancelling the trip and rejecting your teenage daughter in favour of another child is going way too far for a stupidly harsh comment that teenagers are known for making.\n\nI would also remember and try to discuss with your wife that it is perfectly normal and acceptable for your daughter to not want to bring her stepsister on a bonding trip. When you bring both boys on a camping trip you are bringing their sibling, and Layla and Makayla are NOT SIBLINGS.

But your children don't necessarily feel the same way about these new people in their lives, nor can you ask them to. What Layla said was wrong, but likely stemmed from feeling scared that her moment to bond with you, without being interrupted by her stepmother or stepsister (who again, are your family more than hers) would get hijacked if stepsister+stepmother pushed long enough (clearly, Makayla thought that pushing and asking mommy would get her on this trip). \n\nSo overall, yes, you need to bond with Makayla, yes what your daughter said was wrong, but in all this drama you should not forget that it also burns down to your daughter wanting her father and reassurance that she isn't being replaced by another child.", "NTA, although Laila\u2019s comments were out of line, it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that she isn\u2019t able to get father-daughter time and wanted to have a special trip with OP.

In addition, just because the parents fall in love with each other doesn't mean that the kids must feel the same, especially when they are only together on weekends. So Layla likely doesn't consider Makayla a sister, and that is perfectly fine.

There\u2019s a level of comfort with living with someone vs seeing them on the weekends when it\u2019s fun. Makayla is likely parented (disciplined, raised, etc.) by OP with none of the fun of being in a family. I\u2019m sure she has chores, bedtimes, etc. From the sounds of OP admitting he has a soft spot for Layla he likely isn\u2019t putting in near the same level of effort in parenting Layla but makes his relationship with her about fun without her doing any hard work other than being his child.  \n\nBeing in a stepparent dynamic myself with steps who would rather the fun weekends than being parented (and have refused to come if there are rules on bedtime or cleaning up behind themselves,  regardless of how much fun things we do), I can understand how things can be complicated from the non-biological and the biological side.\n\nI can see resentment building from Makayla who, from standing on the outside, is treated more like your child in the way of day-to-day life, but not so much when it comes to doing fun things simply because you don\u2019t share DNA. \n\nI can see Layla maybe feeling that you have a stronger bond with Makayla and feeling jealous, etc. BUT that comes with the territory of actually raising someone vs having fun on the weekends. But she also needs to understand that it\u2019s not always about DNA, but more importantly that she can\u2019t bully others and needs to understand how to express her frustration. She\u2019ll soon find out that she won\u2019t have friends, partners, etc. because only Mommy and Daddy will tolerate her selfishness. Or she\u2019ll end up with someone equally as bad. It will likely also show up later in life when you are able to have a relaxed comfortable relationship with your stepdaughter because it was built and not paid for. Your daughter will pick up on that. I\u2019ve been in situations where my partner was much more relaxed with my family or other families with children and can laugh and enjoy himself because the dynamic was built on mutual respect and love and not on him having to entertain them all the time. \n\nI\u2019d be careful OP that you don\u2019t take for granted the more \u201csecure\u201d relationships you have to appease your daughter/sons. I know from experience how hard it is to put in the hard work of the daily grind of being a family with someone all year only to have to wait for a fun weekend or a holiday together because they want to take their children out to do fun things during the summer because are afraid of saying no to their biological children out of fear they\u2019d never see them again\u2026even though every weekend they see them (when they do) is full of fun things. It\u2019ll build resentment with your wife and anyone else living there doing the hard work with no access to \u201cfun daddy\u201d.\n\nLastly, I also see your predicament of taking just Makayla. It might not be as straightforward as people are suggesting. Are you her legal guardian? How do you feel taking her away alone considering how people might be apt to insinuate something inappropriate? I know personally, I wouldn\u2019t take my steps on holiday alone for a number of reasons relating to the fact that I don\u2019t trust their family or them to not twist something as they\u2019ve done it with other people in their family as if I ask them to stop running in a store, they\u2019ll go back and tell Mommy that I was mean to them and it turns into a nightmare. So I decided not to take on having them alone - they have a father for that. \n\nTo be honest, I would understand if you took your boys separate and my thoughts would say that you\u2019re N T A, but it\u2019s incredibly unfair to take your princess away alone and not share time with your \u201cdaughters\u201d when you do it with your boys. Most parents don\u2019t get 1:1 time with each kid unless they have a manageable number. And I can only imagine if you\u2019re stretched this thin, how much time you\u2019re giving to your wife.", "Dude what post did you read because it certainly wasn\u2019t this one", "Makayla was 3 when OP came into her life. A 3 year old is not rejecting OP because he's not her bio dad. Throughout the last 10 years, if he doesn't know if he's her father figure, i think we have other issues.", "I\u2019m thinking more like Paris, IN!", "They hate stepparents here. If the post would've been written by laila \"my dad promised me a trip, but included his stepdaughter too\" everyone would've called him an AH for taking his stepdaughter.", "You say that the bio daughter is \"paying the price\" but how is she paying the price? She is still going on a trip to Paris with her dad. Her brothers aren't getting one on one time with their dad either, they go fishing all together. She can bond with him as well even with her step sister being on that trip. \nShe was cruel by mentioning her step sister's dad in this way and for that she should be punished. If I spoke to my siblings this way, last thing my parents would do is take me on a trip.\nHe was in his SD life since she was 3, he is the only father figure she has ever known. SD doesn't take priority over his bio daughter, he should treat them equally.", "EXACTLY! I hope none of those people adopt. I can only imagine the trauma that could be caused if they had bio children too.", "I mean, a lifetime of weekly cinema trips without you though? You could absolutely argue one extravagant trip is a reasonable \u2018make up\u2019 for that if it doesn\u2019t hurt the family\u2019s finances.\n\nAlso I live in the UK and have travelled to Paris and it absolutely did not cost a grand minimum lmao. Return flights are not \u00a3400 even for 2 people if you do any kind of basic shopping around/are even slightly flexible on dates and where you fly from - you are either lying about being from the UK or you have never flown to Paris from here. It would be like \u00a3300 even for the height of summer holidays (August) for a peak Friday or Saturday flight time. I\u2019ve seen flights for \u00a350 going if you go at a more undesirable time like midweek or out of the school holidays.", "If it didn\u2019t matter with who, then she would likely be asking her mother to take her. OP admits he does a lot of activities with his sons on weekends, and some stuff with all the kids. I think it\u2019s more than reasonable for this girl to want to go on the daddy daughter trip. It\u2019s also reasonable for OP\u2019s daughter to say no, just not the mean way she chose to say it.", "The 2 older girls already go with their dad. It's just Makayla, trying to join Layla's trip that's a problem. Layla spends little enough time with her dad since his weekends are focused on her brothers.", "Yes there could be very complex dynamics at play here. 8 people brought together to meet the needs of 2. Lot more detail needed to understand this. Good luck OP!", "You mean the child that was bullied and doesn't actually have any father or father figure in her life but op and is the only child that doesn't get fun father child trips and outings? That felt sad and left out and asked for inclusion only to be berated and bullied by the spoiled brat that op admits he is never able to say no to so she gets everything she wants? Laila is the one that said something despicable she's an ah that hasn't fallen far from the ah tree that is op", "Op is literally the only father figure she has had and has been as such since the girl was 3 years old. What a bad and ridiculous take", ">And obviously they're okay with \"sharing\" him. And maybe sometimes only one of them goes...\n\nRather they are ok or not sharing their dad doesn't matter. He is still dad to both of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>No, not really. A stepparent is not the same thing as a parent. When you divorce you stop being a stepparent, but you won't stop being a parent when you have your own kids. Plus, and aita won't admit this because the sub is mostly teenagers with no life experience, but almost no one loves their stepkids as much as they love their kids. I'm sure op's wife loves mikayla more than laila (which is completely normal).\n\nThat is not true. If you build up a relationship with your step kid, even if the marriage ends, the relationship with the kid doesn't stop if you don't want it to. It is the samething with bio kids. I have seen plenty of people give up on being parents to their own kids after a divorce. And I have seen pleanty of divorced step parents still very much involved with their step kids life. \n\nIt all comes down to effort. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Is op's wife laila's mom and includes her all the time when she spends time with her daughters??\n\nI would hope so. I would hope she puts in as much efford in to the relationship with all of her step kids as she does her bio ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If she is a threat to his relationship with his daughter, then maybe it will be the best. His priority should be his 3 kids. Always.\n\nWanting your SO to have a healthy relationship with your child should not be threat to his other child. If Laila is so easialy threatened, than she needs to work on herself. Showing care and compassion to another person should not threaten you.", "I understand that, but then he should strike a balance and stop putting anyone over the other. I still don\u2019t think it excuses \u201cexcluding\u201d Makayla (or anyone). \n\nDad should focus more on all of them as his children and not the boys and Layla. Again, I understand that Layla spends little time with him, but does the focus of spending time (with any of them) always have to be going somewhere or doing something? \n\nIf he takes Layla to Paris alone will that really make their relationship better when they return? What happens when she comes back the next weekend? Does he/do they go back to the same situation where he\u2019s going to have to take her away again for 1:1 time because he\u2019s busy fishing again? What then of Makayla? \n\nHe could be doing a lot more with his daughter on a daily basis, but maybe his guilt of the divorce is keeping him from seeing that. Instead of weekly fishing trips or a trip to Paris which is unrealistic in most families (because weekends are also about catching up around the house), he could take them for lunch, or a movie, or a festival in town. Or even board games or something relaxing at home. It doesn\u2019t have to be an all day event focused on entertainment. You can spend quality time without taking them away all day.", "Exactly", "I mean the girl who when she heard that laila and her dad would go on vacation kept pushing to go with them, despite them telling her no. \n\n If laila would've posted \"my dad promised me a trip, but then brought his stepdaughter too\" everyone would've said he is an AH for ruining father daughter trip.", "Exactly what I was thinking. OP has been in this girl's life for 10 YEARS. He's literally the only father figure she has. \n\nThe boys get fishing trips. The other daughters get trips with their dad. Laila gets a trip to Paris. And Makayla gets nothing. Totally seems fair.  /s.", "Op is also the only father laila has and has been in her life since she was born. Kids come before stepkids", ">Rather they are ok or not sharing their dad doesn't matter. He is still dad to both of them. \n\n\nHe is yes. But we don't know if they always go both of them on the fishing trips, or maybe take turns. \n\n>I have seen plenty of people give up on being parents to their own kids after a divorce.\n\nThen how come is op the bad one for putting his kids first? \n\n>Showing care and compassion to another person should not threaten you.\n\nNo, but having your stepsister, who already spends every day with your dad, coming on a trip who is just for the 2 of you would. \n\n> your SO to have a healthy relationship with your child should not be threat to his other child.\n\nIt is in this case as this could ruin op's relationship with laila. Ultimately, he has to put his kids first. Sorry, but as a parent, it's unconcieveable to me that he is even questioning what to do here... his kids should trump everyone else : stepkids, wives, friends etc.", "Moot point as this trip is promised to Layla and OP stated he's not interested in things Layla likes to do so spends his time with the boys, doing guy stuff. She asked for the trip after years of being ignored.\n\nI don't see Makayla as OPs issue; when he's got custody of his own children they should be his priority. To me the bigger problem is that he does guy stuff and excludes his daughter. He's trying to make up for that by taking her to Paris. \n\nHe could do a lot of things but he's not interested in lunch, a movie or festival. While he could include Makayla it doesn't seem like his kids are interested in having her around.\n\nWhile we know she met OP at 3, we have no idea when his kids met her, her mom or sisters or what kind of relationship they have.", "Life isn't fair. The blame is on mikayla's dad. \n\nAnd op and wife have been together for 6 years, even if they knew each other from before", "I see my point went right over your head! Its ok bud.", "Again, I agree with a lot of what you\u2019re saying. But it doesn\u2019t change my mind that he has some sort of responsibility to treat his stepdaughter/rest of the family with consideration. Unless she has rejected him in the past or there are other concerns, I don\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t consider her with some sort of priority when I\u2019m sure he\u2019s taking on the role of being her parent otherwise. Your priority in this situation is not only to your children from previous relationships, but also the family you\u2019re building (you CHOSE to build). Otherwise OP should stay single until he is done the more involved parts of parenting minors. \n\nTrust me, I get the \u201cThat\u2019s not his child so not his responsibility\u201d argument. But like you said, there are deeper issues here:\n\n1. Being a parent means that your kids will likely have different interests than you. While you might bond with some over shared interests, you have to work sometimes to find common ground with others. It\u2019s already easy enough to bond with your child because they\u2019re your child\u2026it\u2019s doubly easy when they have the same interests as you or you see them as your mini-me. This is lazy parenting he\u2019s doing and it\u2019s sad on all accounts. Makayla is not the reason why he doesn\u2019t spend time with Layla. \n\n2. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s interested in getting a burger somewhere or there\u2019s something else he could do. If not, see Point 1. Again, back to lazy parenting/refusing to put in the effort of fostering a real, deep relationship. \n\n3. The trip was promised likely out of guilt. Did OP think about it much? I live in Europe and even from where I am (a short, cheap flight), going away to Paris is a bit extravagant for a getaway, especially if you\u2019re going to have to do it a couple of times a year or once a year to make them happy. Then what if the boys feel like their fishing trips are not enough anymore and want more from him?\n\n4. Let\u2019s be real, holidays are typically to unwind just as much as to bond. And what bonding will they do there that they can\u2019t do at home? I just fear it\u2019ll set a dangerous precedent for everyone else involved. \n\nMy biggest concern is that OP has promised this trip out of feeling bad for neglecting his daughter as a proper parent. But how will this solve anything? Will he need to promise her a trip to Italy next time she\u2019s feeling neglected in another couple of months? Would this not teach him (and his daughter) that this is how their relationship/a relationship is repaired? Also, is this reflective of his relationships with others? What about Makayla who might just be happy with spending time with him without a big trip to Paris? Maybe she expressed interest because she thought this could be him bonding with his girls the way he bonds with his boys together? Or maybe she is a brat and rude and is only interested in a free trip to Paris. But is that not what his daughter is doing as well?\n\nThere are two hurt and neglected children: Layla, who OP committed to having with her mother (provided that he committed to having children) and Makayla who he also made a sort of commitment to by marrying her mother (knowing?) her father wasn\u2019t in the picture. Maybe a bit more thought should have been given to this. \n\nIn a perfect world, OP would have learned to parent his own kids first before bringing in someone else\u2019s children. But that\u2019s not what he chose and life is not that straightforward. if he\u2019s feeling stretched thin with time with his children, in retrospect, he should have thought about getting into this relationship. It\u2019s not fair to his wife and steps to feel like less of a priority when he chose them just the same.  \n\nAnd I guess I see it personally from the other side that weekend visits/trips don\u2019t always foster a deep lasting relationship into adulthood. I know this from seeing it firsthand. Sometimes all the trips, etc. only lead to a shallow relationship into adulthood that is very transactional/non-existent/shallow because the trips to Disney, or the fun weekends, etc. wasn\u2019t a substitute for a parent who read to them at night, raised them, or was just around at dinner time/taught them life basics, or saw them through the daily ups and downs of life. They saw that parent as an ATM or a free trip and any issues were not resolved, but just covered up by doing something fun after not speaking for a long period of time. Only to hit another issue and repeat the cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard situation for OP, but his focus should be on fostering the healthiest possible relationship with everyone he has invited into his life, not just his own children. He might find (as someone I know personally) that DNA means nothing when you\u2019re in a serious situation and your only relationship with your children has been transactional and it ends up being your friends and in-laws that step up with more love and support than your own blood. \n\nAgain, I understand all perspectives and have limited relationships with some of my steps, but only because of their own choosing. I welcomed them all in and included them regardless. I know I\u2019d likely never love them the way I love my own bios (if I had them), but that\u2019s down to the fact that I don\u2019t have a parent/child relationship with them. They\u2019re more like my nieces and nephews who visit once a month, if that. But if they were living with me or I had the opportunity to pour into them and bond with them on a deeper as I would my own children, that would be a different story and I\u2019d never exclude them simply because of biology.", "You said that her going on a trip would be less of an inconvinience than her asking for her own trip. And i said that it's not better, because it's a special father daughter trip.", "What I am trying to say that creating hierarchies like that amongst the children of a family is damaging. OP and Layla have a unique relationship, and it's totally OK to want to honour that and nurture that specific relationship. Saying that her needs are therefore more important and should come first, is different and really messed up. Both children are equally important. They have different and unique situations, relationships, and needs, which need to be addressed, but creating a hierarchy of 'most important child' to 'least important child' is appalling parenting and will end up damaging all the children.", "> Both children are equally important.\n\nWhen they're yours, sure, absolutely. But that's not the case here."]}
