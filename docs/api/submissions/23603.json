Keira and Isla have the same father, who is actively involved in their lives. However, Makayla\u2019s father is not at all involved and has actively denied her. Since she was 3 I\u2019ve tried to be a father figure to her. Not sure if I am.  \n\n\n  \nI always take my sons to go fishing on the weekends and do other activities that Laila is not interested in. I also do other things with all of the kids together, but never really a father-daughter day with just Laila.  \nI do have a weak heart for Laila, I\u2019ve never really told her no. So when she asked if we could have a father-daughter trip to Paris, I of course said yes. I told my wife and she was fine with it. I think Laila told Makayla about the trip to Paris. Makayla asked if she could also go on the trip with us. Laila said no, It\u2019s just a trip for my dad and me. Makayla then begged if she could also be on the trip, Laila said no and told her to go on a trip with her own father. Makayla was of course upset and went to her room to cry. My wife heard her and went to ask what happened.   \n\n\n  \nOf course, my wife is also upset and wants me to take Makayla on the trip as well. I asked Laila if she was okay with Makayla going with us and she said no absolutely not. Laila also said that Isla and Keira also go on a trip with their father and no one is upset, as well as her brothers going on a trip with just me and that isn\u2019t a problem. I kind of agree with Laila on that. My wife on the other hand will be very upset if I don\u2019t take Makayla on the trip with us.  \n\n\n  \nI asked my sister for advice and she said that it is unfair to exclude Makayla and that Laila can not always have her way. That I should take both or not have a trip at all. I\u2019ve also asked my ex-wife what she thought about the situation and she said that our kids should be my first priority and that it\u2019s unfair to Laila.

That's totally fine.\n\nHOWEVER- you do need to have a sit down, with a reasonable punishment, for Laila her telling Makayla \"to go on a trip with her own father.\" That wasn't okay and Laila is old enough to know better.\n\nThere is also no reason why Makayla can't have a trip of her own. Either with you or with her mom. Ideally that would have been planned in advance but you can fix it. Acknowledge that you guys didn't realize that everyone had a special trip planned but Makayla. Let her pick a place (within reason) that she wants to go to and which parent she wants to take her.\n\nParent/child time is important. Whether it's one on one or one on two. It's important. Remarriages don't change that. But it's also important to make sure that all of the kids are getting a version of the same experience.", "Easy solution. Offer to take M some place of her choice for 1 on 1 time. And take L to Paris. I understand where L is coming from and same with M. The best solution would be to do a one on one trip with them both", "Yta.  You say you have tried to be a father figure to maKayla since she was 3.  But have you really?  Sounds like you are only willing to be a father to her when it\u2019s pleases you and your own daughter.  For Laila to say to makayla to go on a trip with her own father knowing her own father has never been involved is a supremely shitty thing to say.  For that alone, she should not be rewarded with a trip to Paris.  You are raising an entitled brat and and quite frankly a very unkind human being if you allow her to get away with treating her stepsister that way.  Take both girls or don\u2019t go at all.", "Nah yet. Ask makayla if she\u2019d like to have her own father-daughter trip w you. And if you indeed see her as a daughter, tell her. Straighten up Laila while at it. Let her know yoh love maykala as much as her and that her comment was out of line and cruel.", "Than plan another trip with your other daughter.  She will get an alone trip next.  Don\u2019t make this a big thing.  Laila obviously needs time with you.", "NTA. Your bio daughter is entitled to one on one time with her father. Why does everyone else get to spend time with their dads, but your daughter doesn't?  I understand the SD has a deadbeat dad, but that isn't your daughter's fault. You brought your daughter into this world, she is your priority. You do something else with your SD.", "NTA yet.... But I think you need to take a long hard look at what kind of relationship you want with Makayla. I think taking the girls together is out of the picture at this point. You don't seem to be very strong when it comes to sticking up for Makayla and I am afraid this would be the worst vacation of her life. I think throwing them together for this trip would be a disaster. \n\nYes, Isla and Keira go on trips with THEIR father. It is clear that this girl is looking at you as a father figure. What kind of message do you want to leave her with? Talk to her and your current wife, your ex is an ex for a reason and won't have your best interest in this. Whereas, your sister has no skin in this game and probably has the best viewpoint. \n\nMy best advice is take Makayla somewhere special for the two of you and for god sake talk to the girl and let her know that she is important to you.", "NTA I think your ex wife is right. That your kids should be your first priority.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter needs this one on one time with you. She may be feeling a little neglected. She went from being the only girl to having to share you. Your sons still get that one on one bonding time.", "Yes YTA. you chose to be that girl's dad. You chose to be a father to all six children. This is a teachable moment for both girls. For L it's that she must compromise and for M it's that she has a man in her life that would not cast her aside. It's one of those moments that shapes who our children become. \n\nL will have a nice time regardless once she gets there. But this could well be a defining moment for M. She probably already feels insecure about her bio dad tossing her aside. Do you want to do the same?", "YTA and had Laila not said what she said to Makayla, I may have said NTA, but man that girl needs to get some manners and empathy. If Makayla sees you as her dad, which is kind of sounds like she does since you\u2019ve raised her since she was 3, you should take her or at least plan a trip with her . Her situation isn\u2019t like the others and it sounds like you are the only dad she\u2019s ever known. I don\u2019t know, I feel badly for her.", "The trip was planned for you and Laila at Laila's request. You can do another trip another time with Makayla. Just, be sure to actually do so. It's healthy for kids to have the undivided attention of their parent in a household full of siblings.  NTA based on all of it together.  But do call down Laila over her nastiness toward Makayla. You are effectively the only Dad Makayla has, there's no call for her to be cruel.", "Frankly ESH except for Makayla\n\nI understand wanting one on one time with Laila, but Paris, really? There are other less extravagant ways to have daddy daughter time. \n\nLaila for saying what she said and excluding Makayla when she knows her bio dad isn\u2019t involved and you\u2019re her father figure. \n\nAnd finally, your wife - look I get she wants Makayla included (and a trip to Paris? I get it) however Laila should also be able to have one on one time with you without having to compete for your attention. \n\nYou can absolutely do this trip with Laila and not include Makayla but be prepared for it to negatively affect your marriage as well as your relationship with Makayla", "YTA. \n\nThe Paris trip sounds ridiculously extravagant for only 1 child out of 6. \n\nYou do activities with both boys, and consider the 2:1 time sufficient. \n\nYou have parented Mikayla full time since she was 10, but presumably were at least partly involved since she was 8. \n\nWhy does she get excluded from your 2:1 boy time. You only mention that Laila doesn\u2019t enjoy their activities - so presumably she would be welcome if she wanted to join - is Mikayla even invited to those?\n\nLaila\u2019s cruelty to Mikayla should mean the Paris trip is cancelled. She gloated over being taken on the trip and also over having a bio-dad. That\u2019s incredibly mean. \n\nWhy would you reward her bullying by *asking her* if you were allowed to invite Mikayla? Who is the parent here? \n\nUnfortunately with the bullying not resolved, it probably won\u2019t be a good idea to take both girls on a 2:1 trip (potentially to someone cheaper if you cannot afford both girls to go) - otherwise that would be the logical answer. \n\nUltimately YTA for not dealing with the bullying effectively, and also for being dishonest about \u201ctrying to be a dad to Mikayla\u201d for the last 4-6 years. \n\nYou talk about your sons and Laila with the fishing weekends. You say that *Laila* deserves a 1:1 daddy-daughter thing. No where in any of that do you mention Mikayla. Which makes it sound like you don\u2019t consider her your child.", "Why don't you take Laila on a trip and have Makayla plan her own trip with you?", "YTA. Why are you not treating all your kids the same. This includes your son and your daughters. You say you take your sons fishing on weekends but make no attempt to do anything with either of your daughters? YTA for that alone. If Laila wants a trip with just her dad thats fair enough especially after watching her brothers always having guy time, but her comment to Makayla was not ok and there needs to be consequences for it. Make sure Makayla gets a trip too as in her eyes your are the only father figure shes ever had, so treat your daughters the same. And overall just be a better dad to your daughters in general.", "YTA", "| Since she was 3 I\u2019ve tried to be a father figure to her.\n\nNot like this you aren't. Take your daughters to Paris. Otherwise, YWBTA.", "30 years from now, you\u2019re going to have a medical emergency and Laila will call Makayla and say, Dad needs our help. And Makayla will say, you both made it pretty clear I don\u2019t have a dad. And you\u2019ll both be shocked she won\u2019t help. \nThis is why. Shame on you. YTA", "If the next trip you have planned is a trip to Paris with Makayla then it\u2019s fine, but it doesn\u2019t really sound like it. YTA.", "NTA because she asked and was told no and that should be respected - your daughter deserves just dad and her time.\n\nBut you really need to talk to Laila about why what she said to Mikayla was wrong, because she knows she doesn\u2019t have a father to do things with and that was uncalled for.", "NTA.   This is not a family vacation, it is a father/daughter trip.   If your wife feels like Makayla is left out, she should plan a trip with her.\n\nBut curious as to why Laila doesn\u2019t want Makayla to go, do they not get along?", "I'm going to go with NTA, but you are literally stuck between the proverbial \"rock and a hard place\".  On the one hand, if you don't take Makayla, you risk alienating her and putting undue hardship on your marriage.  On the other, if you do take Makayla, you risk potentially ruining your relationship with Laila.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat Laila said to Makayla after she begged to go on the trip is beyond being reprehensible.  I think everyone here agrees to that.  It was cold and cruel and not something that she should be saying to her step-sister.  Especially knowing that Makayla's biological father actively denies her existence.  Clearly the two do not get along well, and I wonder if Laila was telling Makayla about the trip to essentially \"rub it in\" that you two were planning on this wonderful trip to Paris.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, Makayla does need to learn when someone says no, that it's not an invitation to keep badgering them about it.  Laila **does** deserve to have time with you where she doesn't have to vie for your attention with her siblings.  I'm not sure that a trip to Paris is exactly appropriate for that, but that's not for me to decide.  It's your family and your choice.  I can only give my opinion.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can understand your ex-wife's perspective in that you should place your kids first, but when you married your current wife, you also took on those kids knowing full well that you were planning on being a father figure for them.  (Or at least to Makayla.)  Your current wife needs to understand, though, that your kids also need to have time by themselves with you without having her children around.  She shouldn't be placing pressure on you to take Makayla with you when there's no reason why you can't take another trip with her, alone, later.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould you choose to take Makayla on this trip, you will need to sit down with Makayla and your wife together and explain that if you do this and she goes on the trip, the next \"daddy-daughter\" trip that you take with Makayla will **have to** involve Laila as well.  It just wouldn't be fair otherwise (and it sounds like you want to do what is deemed most \"fair\" to everyone involved).  I would also make it abundantly clear that this would not be up for discussion, either.  If Makayla goes now, Laila goes later.  Period.  Vice versa applies too.  If Makayla does not go now, Laila does not go later.  Period.  If you do wind up taking Makayla and Laila finds out that you went on a trip with Makayla later on solo, you can kiss your relationship with Laila goodbye (and rightfully so).  You betrayed her at that point and that kind of betrayal isn't lightly forgiven.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I would have a sit down with Laila and explain that a trip to Paris would be wonderful, however, if she is insistent on Makayla not attending, that she will need to choose a different place to visit so that you can also have money to take a trip with her sister that she didn't want attending.  That she will have to compromise on something, somewhere.  Either her sister goes now and you all 3 go to Paris, or she stays home and Laila and yourself go somewhere more appropriate (for lack of a better word) for a visit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I certainly don't envy your position, OP.  No matter what you choose, someone is going to get hurt.  Just do the best you can to minimize the damage.", "All the parents here are AH    Poor Makayla seems to get nothing special from anyone.", "I want to say NTA but wether or not Mikayla views you as a father figure that is the role you took on by marrying her mother; on the one hand Laila should be entitled to her own father-daughter trip/thing and her indignation at the possibility of Mikayla basically shoehorning herself into her trip sounds justified on the surface, but what she told her about her father was way over the line whether or not he was absent.\n\nThen on the other hand it does not sound justified from your perspective, why doesn\u2019t Mikayla deserve a father-daughter trip? You said yourself you\u2019ve been trying to be a father figure to her, since before she could remember, that should go even when things are tough, shouldn\u2019t it? \n\nI don\u2019t know your money situation but morally speaking I\u2019d say the best thing to do would be to go on two separate trips; seeing as this isn\u2019t possible for just anyone the next sensible option is for Laila to swallow the pill and have a joint trip, IMO having a father-daughter thing more like her brothers\u2019 fishing trips is the fair thing, not a trip to Paris.\n\n I think your ex-wife has your priorities distorted; you\u2019re sharing a life with another woman, who has a child which you from your description helped raise since she was 3 years old; you can\u2019t just dismiss that with blood relations.\n\nI think Mikayla isn\u2019t TA for her expectations, is TA for what she said, your Ex-wife is TA for making you prioritize her daughter over your CURRENT WIFE\u2019S DAUGHTER, to be clear, both are yours.

While you're a father figure to Makayla, you're not her actual father. Spending time with just your sons but taking your stepdaughter on a father-daughter vacation tells Laila that it's not as important to spend time with her as it is to spend time with your sons.\n\nYou told Laila you'd take her to Paris, just her. It's no longer a father-daughter trip when you add another person.\n\nWhile I'm sure your wife would prefer you take Makayla, she said it was fine until M begged to go. Your wife of 4 yrs can't expect your daughter to want to include M in her trip.", "NTA, your daughter asked for a trip with only you, if you take Makayla she will never forgive you and probs go no contact. Is not worth it to ruin your relationship with your daughter to please a wife", "NTA .. it\u2019s clear just from her comment that she\u2019s feeling threatened for some reason. She\u2019s insecure and wants to spend some time with just you. Maybe Paris isn\u2019t appropriate. Maybe someplace else is better.

If this is you treat Makayla than your wife needs to protect her from you and your daughter. If she needs to do that than you all need to divorce so she doesn\u2019t have to be around you.

Laila isn\u2019t asking for anything that others in the family haven\u2019t already had - no reason she should have to share her trip with Makayla. \n\nThe best option is probably for Makayla to get her own trip, with her mother. Of course you could take her on one, but if you\u2019re not sure whether she actually sees you as her dad then I\u2019m less sure about that, since it might be Paris that\u2019s the interest for her here and not going with you specifically.", "NTA if you take Makayla on a separate trip of her own", "NTA", "I think overall NTA for not bringing your stepdaughter, but if you consider yourself her father I would offer to go on a father-daughter activity of similar emotional value another time. \n\nWhat your daughter said to Makayla is wrong and she should experience some consequences, but cancelling the trip and rejecting your teenage daughter in favour of another child is going way too far for a stupidly harsh comment that teenagers are known for making.\n\nI would also remember and try to discuss with your wife that it is perfectly normal and acceptable for your daughter to not want to bring her stepsister on a bonding trip. When you bring both boys on a camping trip you are bringing their sibling, and Layla and Makayla are NOT SIBLINGS.

But your children don't necessarily feel the same way about these new people in their lives, nor can you ask them to. What Layla said was wrong, but likely stemmed from feeling scared that her moment to bond with you, without being interrupted by her stepmother or stepsister (who again, are your family more than hers) would get hijacked if stepsister+stepmother pushed long enough (clearly, Makayla thought that pushing and asking mommy would get her on this trip). \n\nSo overall, yes, you need to bond with Makayla, yes what your daughter said was wrong, but in all this drama you should not forget that it also burns down to your daughter wanting her father and reassurance that she isn't being replaced by another child.", "NTA, although Laila\u2019s comments were out of line, it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that she isn\u2019t able to get father-daughter time and wanted to have a special trip with OP.

In addition, just because the parents fall in love with each other doesn't mean that the kids must feel the same, especially when they are only together on weekends. So Layla likely doesn't consider Makayla a sister, and that is perfectly fine.

Paris is one of the most expensive city in France.", "> Idk to me it\u2019s just weird that OP wouldn\u2019t be sure wether he truly is Makayla\u2019s father figure.\n\nIf he\u2019s not sure, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t truly see himself as Makayla\u2019s father, at least not in the same way he sees himself as Laila\u2019s father. \n\nIf OP saw himself as both girls\u2019 father, and Makayla as just as much his daughter as Laila is, then he would have either included Makayla in the Paris trip from the start, or planned a different trip with her.\n\nWe know how Laila, Makayla, OP\u2019s ex, OP\u2019s current wife and OP\u2019s sister feel on the subject of Makayla being part of the trip, but not OP. Does OP actually want Makayla there? Does he want to have a separate trip with her if she doesn\u2019t go to Paris? \n\nI think that the Paris trip needs to be OP and Laila, but there are deeper issues that this family needs to address. It shouldn\u2019t have been left up to Laila to seek one to one time with her dad. OP should have stepped in when Makayla wouldn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer and instead organized a trip for the two of them.", "We don't know if he is parenting her. She was 10 when they got married, and 8 when they started dating. It's not like he raised her from birth.", "\"Since she was 3 I  have tried to be a father figure to her\"", "Is she not a daughter to the man who parents her? That's the crux of this. People on this board are acting like she needs to somehow be better, do better, in order to be worthy of his love, attention, and being treated as a daughter. She doesn't. She is worthy of love and inclusion regardless. If OP is trying to be a father figure when it comes to day-to-day discipline, but suddenly when it comes to an amazing fun treat it's reserved for someone else, someone who said something incredibly cruel, no less.... what message is that for a girl to hear at an age when self-esteem is very vulnerable and messages about how you will be treated, are so quickly internalised?\n\nLayla isn't wrong for wanting one-on-one time with her dad, that is a normal and lovely thing to want. But this is not a zero sum game. Both girls have valid needs, and it is up to OP, as the adult and parent to BOTH girls, to make sure he gives them what they are asking for. One needs inclusion and reassurance, one needs specific and dedicated attention. Yes it's tough but when you have so many kids, these are the most important things you can possibly do. Paris is beside the point here.", "They have been together for 6 years and married for 4. They knew each other, but i'm guessing he was more of \"mom's friend\" than father figure. Either way, he's laila's dad since she was born and he is her actual father, so she comes first.", ">are acting like she needs to somehow be better, do better, in order to be worthy of his love, attention, and being treated as a daughter.\n\nNo one said that she needs to do this and that. We're just saying she is not his daughter. \n\n>If OP is trying to be a father figure when it comes to day-to-day discipline,\n\nWe don't know if he has any say in her discipline. \n\n>That's the crux of this.\n\nNo, the crux of this is if he is willing to ruin his relationship with his daughter by giving in to his wife and his stepdaughter's emotional blackmail. At the end of the day, his priority should always be his 3 kids. Not his wife and her kids. A wife you can always divorce, and her kids won't be your stepkids anymore, but his kids are always gonna be his kids."]}
