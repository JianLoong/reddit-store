My birth mother left us when I was 3 years old and only paid child support to my dad. Her family was completely on our side and they helped my dad to raise me because my dad lost his mom and dad when he was little and he only had one aunt who was terminally ill at that time. My dad sees them as real family.\n\nMy husband Patrick(fake name) (45M) is a retired adult movie actor and if you have ever watched adult gay movies, you most probably have seen him. He retired from the sector at 2016 and he opened his own restaurant near to the University where I did my PhD. I was one of his restaurant's regulars and that was the way we met. Before adult movie sector, he was actually a chef(he has a masters degree in culinary arts) and he started to make adult movies at age of 24 for fun but than he was discovered and he started to work with studios and he was discovered. When his family discovered, they effectively kicked him out and he still gets threats from his birth family time-to-time. He even had to get Restraining Orders against his brothers. Only people that accepted her was her sister(52F),who also doesn't have any ties with the family since she started Medical School. \n\nMy family isn't homophobic in the slightest, when I came out as gay at age 20,the only response I got was \"Ok, what do you want for dinner?\" The problem is, they are really snob about people. \n\nWhen they learned what my husband used to do as a job before the restaurant business ,it was a big fight and I had to cut out everyone but my dad 3 years ago. I didn't block them on anything but I said I don't want them around until they respect my husband or there would be dire consequences. I only saw them at weddings or at funerals of our acquaintances and never went to family events.3 months ago, Patrick proposed to me and I said yes. For the legal purposes, we got eloped but we will have a wedding party in April and we are planning to be a huge one. Patrick is originally Italian and I am Half Greek-Half Turkish and we have a wide social circle and people that we want to invite.\n\nAfter our elopement, I got a phone call from my grandmother. She said she and grandpa wanted to talk with us and asked us to come together. I was planning to ignore it but my husband insisted we had to go. When we went there, they were really apologetic. They said they were wrong about their assumptions and they actually have changed their minds after the first year but they were afraid to approach me and they said they want to pay for all of the wedding party expenses. I got mad. We started to have a fight and yelled a lot if things and left.

You started dating an ex porn star who is 20 years older than you and your family was skeptical. Now, not only did they apologize, they even offered to pay for your wedding and your reaction is to FREAK THE FUCK OUT???? Of course YTA", "YTA", "Is there a tiny possibility that they\u2019re just human beings that made a mistake, it took them time to admit it and had to gain some courage to apologise (perhaps because they were aware of your anger issues)\u2026 and because they knew you\u2019d react.. well. Exactly how you DID react?\n\nI mean.. I understand it hurts when people walk out of your life for no reason, but closing out people that actually try and make efforts because they want back in? That\u2019s absolutely on you.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nWhat exactly did you want them to do? Get on their knees and plead for forgiveness? They apologized and admitted they were judgemental and dealt with things the wrong way and even offered to pay for your wedding party. You admit to having anger issues and seems like you still have not dealt with them. If you want a relationship with your family you can at least meet them halfway here. You are allowed to still be upset but yelling and fighting is not going to help.", "YTA. In this situation. It\u2019s understandable to still harbor resentment. You probably wanted to give them a piece of your mind for some time. But they\u2019ve apologized. \n\nYou didn\u2019t want them around \u201cuntil they respect your husband.\u201d Sounds like they do and are extending an olive branch. Accept it. \n\nLife\u2019s too short and people make mistakes. I\u2019d apologize for the reaction and then close that chapter and move on to a happy new one.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYour family heard about your big news and finally summoned the courage to say something they have been afraid to for years. That doesn't sound like a whim to me.  \n\n\nIt's possible that your grandparents are just people doing the best they can. They reached out and tried to make peace and you kind of slapped them in the face for it.  \n\n\nI would say the next move is yours.", "Yeah, YTA. What else should they do? They realise they made a mistake and offer to broker peace, returning to a united family and scream at them because they want to do that? I don't get you. What is this? Pride? A grudge? Your husband is right, you are wrong, accept their olive branch.", "YTA change should be accepted not yelled at", "YTA\n\nThey are even paying for the wedding as an apology, what else do you want?!", "YTA.\n\nIt was sincere, and it seems to be, then you should have accepted.\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by \u201cyou don\u2019t try mend these things in a whim\u201d?  \n\nWhy don\u2019t you try mend things?\n\nWhy was it \u201cin a whim\u201d?", "Small YTA. I understand your frustration with them. But they apologized and even offered to pay for your party. I think they really mean it. In the end, it is your party. You can invite whoever you want to. Just think about it.", "NTA but not an example of perfect behaviour. You have some anger issues that you may want to work through. \n\nFirstly, I sympathise with your situation, I can\u2019t imagine having those sort of issues. \n\nI don\u2019t really subscribe to the theory that once someone apologises you\u2019re not allowed to react badly and have to forgive them instantly. For me, it\u2019s sort of like victim blaming. However it\u2019s hard to know how justified your reaction was without being there. It\u2019s been 2 years since they changed their mind, meanwhile you\u2019ve been outcast by the family (your choice to breakaway, fair enough, but not your decision for them to kick off about your life) If it were me I wouldn\u2019t expect to be embraced with open arms.\n\nIf you can\u2019t forgive your family, I wouldn\u2019t sweat it. If people are toxic in my life, I don\u2019t want them in it, not matter what the relation. If you think you can get past it - 3 years isn\u2019t huge in the grand scheme of life - work with them to start repairing the damage. \n\nBest of luck", "It\u2019s nice that they\u2019ve decided to try to compensate for their past mistakes, but I understand how it might have seemed kind of tone deaf, like they\u2019re trying to buy your feelings.\n\n\nThey have no idea what they put you through and came to terms with it on their own time, expecting you to welcome them back with open arms, when you are in no way obligated to do so.\n\n\nWe weren\u2019t there so we don\u2019t know how things really went down but it kind of sounds like you\u2019re still feeling really betrayed by the people who were supposed to have your back, and insulted by their efforts to redeem themselves in their own eyes.\n\n\nNTA. You don\u2019t have to forgive anyone you don\u2019t want to. This sounds very frustrating.", "Hey, what a neat backstory here. I love it. \n\nI think you're right to follow your feelings. If you want to make up with them, do so. If you don't want to, don't. This is such a personal matter that only you can advise yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
