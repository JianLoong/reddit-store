I\u2019ve always asked him if he can take me to the airport if it\u2019s a reasonable time but I\u2019ve never asked him to pick me up because I\u2019d get back incredibly late. I\u2019ve always managed to find a way there & back. \n\nI\u2019m an esthetician so I work long hours & it\u2019s manual labor that is draining my body & emotions & because of this I need at least 8 hours of sleep every night to be able to perform my job. I understand not everyone needs a lot of sleep to be productive but I do. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s flight is leaving at 5:45 on Sunday morning & gets back at 11 on Thursday night. He didn\u2019t ask me if I could take him & pick him up, instead he told me the times & expected me to. I said I\u2019d be willingly to take him to the airport because I don\u2019t work Sunday or Monday so I\u2019d be able to catch up on sleep. However I told him I wouldn\u2019t pick him up because I\u2019ll be in bed before 10. He got upset & explained how he has to work Friday too & won\u2019t be getting a lot of sleep either so it\u2019s not that big of deal for me to not get my 8 hours of sleep, if he can do it so can I. I said no, I explained how he never even asked me if I could & shouldn\u2019t get mad at me for saying no to something I was never asked to do. He said it was a bigger ask to take him to the airport then to pick him up based on the times. I told him he could take an Uber home but he complained that would be expensive so he then offered to pay me to pick him up. I still said no unless he can pay me in several hours of sleep I\u2019ll be missing. He said he\u2019ll have to figure it out then because I\u2019m being difficult & the conversation ended there. So\u2026AITA for saying no?\n\nEdit: \n-He only need\u2019s about 5/6 hours of sleep whereas I need 8/9 hours\n-I work 10 hour days doing manual labor & he works 7 hour days at a desk\n-He\u2019s never offered to pick me up from the airport so I\u2019ve always taken an Uber home\n-We live 25 minutes from the airport\n\nEdit 2:\n-I always go to bed before him & wake up after him even tho he goes to work earlier than me & that\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t need as much sleep as I do to function\n-I\u2019ve gone on 2 work trips & each time he\u2019s dropped me off but hasn\u2019t picked me up\n-I stand for 7-10 hours a day performing body treatments, facials, waxing, etc. so I do consider my job manual labor.

Her work may be physically taxing and include the use of her hands, but it\u2019s definitely not manual labor. What you\u2019re describing is just physical activity", "Don't know if he did or didn't. My only point is that Uber can absolutely be very expensive.", "Man my *family* doesn't even pick each other up from the airports haha\n\nGive and take is *extremely* important in relationships but so is respecting the others boundaries and capabilities. OP doesn't feel like she can function and do her job w/o sleep and she's expressed that. The difference in expectations needs to be talked about so they can decide what they value in a partnership and if it's a deal breaker. And even if it is I don't think that makes either of them assholes!", "I mean next time she needs a favour and he says no she shouldn't be surprised. Give and take.", "And she does. Are you fucking blind or just that much of a biased dick for no reason?", "Agreed and seeing as how he doesn't pick her up from the airport I think it's *him* facing those consequences right now. Airport pick ups were not an expectation in this relationship and if he wants it to be that needs to be discussed and then go both ways", "His selfishness won\u2019t work in his favour. If he keeps on being self-centred, not caring about her health or needs, he will soon find himself single.", "Chill. I'm being respectful you aren't.", "My god. You all make it sound like missing a couple of hours of sleep is life and death.", "I'm sorry you're too inept to answer a question.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend has emotional baggage. Most likely, he feels entitled to other services from you that you haven't found out about yet.\n\nTreat this as a red flag.\n\nIdeally, he should have asked, \"Would you please\" and been okay with hearing \"no.\"  \nSecond best, he should have heard, \"Sorry, I can't\" and politely made alternate arrangements.\n\nThe fact that he's trying to argue you into doing what he wants is a clear sign that he loves himself more than he loves you. He has given himself permission to ignore your needs and feelings. Your health and happiness are not high on his priority list.", "\"no\" is a full sentence.

He set the precedence, you are merely following it.", "NTA I used to travel constantly for work and would always check with my partner as to whether it was doable for them to drop me off or pick me up and I always did a cab or rideshare when the timing conflicted with their sleep which was often the case for my return trips.", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s asked, you answered. If you feel like being super generous, offer to split the uber, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to do that. Google maps will tell you exactly what bus to take to get home from the airport.", "My parents have been married for 38 years and my dad still ASKS my mom to drop him off and pick him up from the airport. When we lived farther away and the airport was in a bad area and he was coming back late, he would either drive his car and pay to park or get a cab/Uber home because he didn't want my mom doing it.", "In my family (across generations) picking up and dropping off from the airport is a love language. \n\nI've had situations where I fly in too early, but 2 sides of family compete who will do it instead. They later settle who gets pick up who gets drop off. Cute.\n\nIt's definitely never assumed! And it's definitely the loving response to **insist** no one does it if it's a truly inconvenient time/place.", "I've been married more than 30 years and I STILL ask my husband stuff like this.", "I\u2019ve been with my spouse 42 years and would never just assume he was willing and able to do airport runs. This entitlement boggles my mind.", "He wasn't planning on paying OP the Uber rate.  Probably just fuel money", "Unfortunately he & I have been disagreeing on several things such as I feel like a connivence for him rather an equal partner. I cook, clean, doing the errands, laundry, etc. When we first moved in together I explained how I don\u2019t like to clean or do laundry or cook but I\u2019m willing to split the jobs equally because that\u2019s what a team should do. He refuses to do the laundry because it\u2019s not in our apartment & says he will help with it when we have an in unit but who knows when that\u2019ll be\u2026 amongst several other things", "That all reinforces my belief he loves himself more than he loves you.\n\nAssume things to get worse over time. Do not kid yourself that you can get him to change in a positive way.", "I know right?  I know a woman who chose to use an airport 2 hours away for better airfare but wouldn\u2019t pay $8/ day parking for a week long trip.  She made her boyfriend shlep her, her kids and all their luggage to both drop them off AND pick them up, when he was already house/ dog sitting at personal inconvenience.  Knowing her, she probably also didn\u2019t pay his gas, tolls, or do anything nice to reciprocate.  \n\nImagine thinking your $8/ day was too expensive but your boyfriend\u2019s gas and 8 hours of his life was inconsequential in the name of convenience and saving $56.", "NTA - The expectation of it all is what rubs me the wrong way.  Yes, you two live together and should help and support each other - But!  That doesn't mean you assume your SO will do whatever you want them to without question.", "NTA.  You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries in a relationship.  Good for you.", "NTA - when I\u2019ve been able to drive my husband (boyfriend at the time) to the airport, I\u2019ve been the one to offer. \nThe one time HE declined was when he had to leave early in the morning (3 or 4 am) and I had to work at 7:30am. We lived 50 minutes away from the airport, and my work was only 30 minutes away from the airport. While I should\u2019ve been fine time wise, it was the uncertainty of traffic and waking up extra early he declined.", "Picking up people from the airport is a pain in the ass. Particularly if you are told and not asked. NTA. Don\u2019t expect any rides to or from the airport from him. He will feel he owes you one even if unlike him you ask politely.", "nta. first of all he shouldnt be demanding things of you. to just assume youll do it is so fucked ESPECIALLY since in his place you DO ask. thats not reciprocity. a healthy relationship is based on love, communication, respect of boundaries, and equality.  he doesnt have any problem with you taking an uber home so whats his problem? he thinks hes entitled to your time and effort in a way he doesnt preform for you", "NTA and it's about time people started budgeting regular transportation costs like getting to and from the airport into their vacation budget. I am sorry he's willing to sacrifice your sleep, health and well being to save him the cost of an Uber.", "I\u2019m sorry but the moment he complained an Uber would be too expensive was it for me!! Like excuse me but haven\u2019t you had to Uber home because he didn\u2019t pick you up. You stated you\u2019ve found your own way back and fourth.  So it\u2019s okay for you to pay for an Uber but not him. He said he was willing to pay you? Charge him what an Uber would be!! \n\nSo yeah NTA", "GTFO.\nHe actually thinks that you are there at his disposal for airport runs.\nLook, just because you\u2019re in a relationship that doesn\u2019t mean you are an automatic slave.\nI completely support helping each other out but not if it\u2019s too inconvenient.\nYou are so NTA.\nTell your boyfriend that\u2019s his poor planning is not your problem.", "YTA, you ask him for at least part of this and the other part you don't because you're coming home very late. It's really rude to just flat out deny doing the same for him!", "What\u2019s the point of being in a relationship if exceptions to the norm are completely off the table?", "NTA. My husband flies constantly and he always asks me. If a flight is extremely early or late he assumes he will pay for a car unless I specifically say I\u2019d like to do it anyway (to spend more time with him or if I have nothing to do the next day etc). \n\nAfter 11 years, he always asks, because he respects that my schedule is just as important as his, and, more importantly, he\u2019s an adult who is capable of arranging transportation to and from an airport\u2026 I still drive him most of the time, but he appreciates it rather than expects it. \n\nBased on your other comments, this man sounds like a tall child. He refuses to do his own laundry until it\u2019s more convenient for him? Seriously? I hope you have a good think about what you deserve and whether you\u2019re being appreciated. He\u2019s showing you who he is.", "Nta. I have sleep apnea and a very strict bedtime.

I love my family and friends but have told them all I will not drop off or pick up from LAX. It's insane, the stress of that place is too much. For a few people I will offer to pay for the Uber. For the rest--- just no. Just because I own a utility trailer doesn't mean I'm free to help people move out of and into houses, and just because I own a car doesn't mean I'm free to be the airport shuttle.", "Good point that he will probably wake her up. She should arrange to spend the night at a friend's place.", "OP should stay in a hotel that night, but not tell the boyfriend, so she can get her 40 winks!", "I swear most people on this sun hate their partners", "That is so odd. I\u2019m happy it works for you but if my husband didn\u2019t ask me if I was available to drive him, there is a good chance I might be busy. TBH this sounds more codependent than healthy. Expecting your partner to always be available at your beck and call with nothing else happening in their lives is strange. And I say this as 1/2 of a long married couple where the running joke with our friends & family is how grossly in love we are. But, who knows, maybe you have super specific routines that never change and you\u2019ve memorized each other\u2019s schedules and don\u2019t ever make plans outside of those schedules separately?

You need your sleep. \n\nRefuse to discuss it further with him. He sounds really selfish.", "NTA. but can't he take his car and park at the airport in long term parking?", "NTA.  It sounds like you and your boyfriend aren\u2019t right for each other.", "I feel like I\u2019m in the massive minority here, but I think you should be there for your loved ones. I would always pick a partner or sibling or anyone who needed a ride up from the airport up because that\u2019s something you do for the people you love. I\u2019d be a little upset if my partner didn\u2019t pick me up because they had to work in the morning, but maybe that\u2019s just me.", "NTA.  If he doesn't do for you why does he expect it?  Sounds entitled.  \n\nMy Husband always makes sure his take offs and landings are at a time convenient for me IF he wants me to drive the 1.5 hours, it takes round trip, to drop him off or pick him up.  Otherwise he takes his car and parks or has a friend do it.  Does he have a friend who might help him out?  You are not responsible for his bad planning.", "NTA I would be concerned that a partner I had been with for 5 years did not understand my sleep patterns/requirements.", "NTA. My partner works early, plus does a hard job. He needs his sleep. I always cab home if it\u2019s late. Plus he should have asked, it\u2019s rude to just assume.", "Hell, my parents brought me into this world and still help pay for some of my expenses, and it\u2019s still 100% up to me if I want to help them with airport drop offs/pick ups.", "It\u2019s time for you to start doing your own laundry and let him take care of his own.  Since my husband and I moved in together 25+ years ago, we have always done our own. I\u2019m not his mother or his maid.  When he has no clean clothes he will learn to appreciate everything you do. He sounds like a tool.", "Unless his family, who he's going with is paying for it.", "Then pay for the Uber.", "NTA. It\u2019s sad you have to bring receipts to folks on the internet. Your SO needs to learn that no is a full sentence.", "He can't hire a car to the airport? NAH. (Can you tell I hate taking my husband to the airport? Its ghastly. But, I do it. I wish I had the gumption to tell him to walk home from O'Hare.)", "NTA, my parents have been together for 22 years, married for 17, if my dads flight for a work trip is really early on a weekday/Sunday he will get a taxi, if he gets back too late on a weekday/Sunday he will get a taxi, because he knows that my mom needs her sleep for her job\n\nYour bf should understand the same thing", "NTA. Wild that he doesn\u2019t give you the basic courtesy of asking, nor understand and respect your no. This says a few things about your bf that aren\u2019t very nice. Coupled with the fact he has never done this for you? His attitude is gross.", "NTA. He is a grown ass adult man and he can damn well Uber both ways.", "YTA - I was prepared to say he didn\u2019t ask you, and it\u2019s rude to assume. He\u2019s an AH, but now I see you are an AH too, because, you went on and on about how you are so special and need so much sleep. I hope you are aware that with that attitude, you cannot raise a baby. Kids don\u2019t care if you get over 8 hours of sleep. They don\u2019t often let you sleep in on days off either.", "NTA. Just the lack of respect to not even ask is baffling to me. Also, an uber would be expensive so he offered to pay you instead? Kind of defeats the purpose doesnt it? On top of that, flights can get delayed, if its already at a bad time for you if the flight is on time imagine if its delayed by 2 hours.", "I hate driving to O'Hare with the white hot intensity of one million suns. Midway is a breeze. But how I hate, hate, hate, loathe and despise and get anxiety trying to manage O'Hare Int. Hire a car, a donkey, a bike. Whatever. Leave me out of it please. I will pay for your ride. Just leave me alone.", "She also said that she Ubers home from the airport and doesn\u2019t ask him for rides, so he\u2019s definitely being entitled and presumptive here.", "I read a tweet once that said something along the lines of \"In Chicago we don't say I love you, we say 'I'll pick you up at O'Hare.'\" Lol! I think of it everytime our parents offer to pick us up when we come in", "Op said that they Uber home from the airport and don\u2019t ask him for rides.
