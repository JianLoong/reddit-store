Who i\u2019ll call Mia (17F) and Jaime (16F) (fake names).\n\nFor some background knowledge: \nMy SIL passed away 4 years ago due to cancer, Mia and SIL had a very close relationship. SIL played violin and Mia was interested in playing because of SIL. She was given SIL violin before she passed away.\n\nIts something Mia cherishes greatly.\n\nJaime has been having some setbacks in her behavior and mental health for the past 2.5 years. She\u2019s in therapy, and we\u2019ve had talks. She\u2019s been improving, although its slow. \nShe\u2019s been acting out a lot, arguing, yelling.\n\nMia and Jamie aren\u2019t close, but they usually don\u2019t argue. \n\nNow for the issue at hand\n\nMia and Jamie were arguing about something, that changed into multiple different topics. \nMia made constant jabs at Jamie about stuff she was dealing with. In return, Jamie broke the violin.\n\nMy husband and I were not home when it happened. Jamie admitted to breaking the violin because of what Mia said.\n\nMia is obviously distraught. She\u2019s even more upset with Jamie now.\n\nI\u2019m not defending either daughters, they both said and did stuff they weren\u2019t supposed to. And I do believe both daughters should be punished. \n\nFor Jamies punishment my husband and I cannot agree if Jamie should repay Mia for the violin.  I believe she should, though a new violin won\u2019t make up for the emotional aspect of SILs violin. Jamie doesn\u2019t want to pay Mia back.\n\nHowever my husband doesn\u2019t think she should because of what Mia said. Saying that Jamie is still in therapy so we shouldn\u2019t punish her for what she does, just take her to therapy and talk it out.\n\nHe thinks i\u2019m the AH because Mia started it, and because Jamie doesn\u2019t want to lose her money.

Is repairing it not feasible?", "NTA \n\nShe should pay for the new violin AND both sisters should have some therapy together to talk it out.", "NTA - Difficult because I can see your husband's point about Mia's provocation however he's completely wrong about there should be no consequences for Jamie, she needs to understand that violence and destroying other people's things is absolutely never acceptable. If she gets away with this she'll learn that she can use her issues to get away with things and you'll be setting yourselves up for a world of trouble.\n\nI think the answer is you have to clearly punish both girls. Jamie should absolutely have to pay Mia back for the violin, however, Mia must also receive a punishment fitting her actions and Jamie has to see her being punished also. Both girls should be required to apologise to one another too. If you're still unsure perhaps you can disucss it with her therapist first and take her suggetsion on board.", "NTA\nIf you're concerned with Jamies mental health, maybe you could give her therapist a heads up. Can Jamie and Mia have a session with a therapist to talk about everything?\n\nJamie should pay for a new violin. Actions have consequences and it's a lesson she is going to learn the hard way. Sometimes a sorry isn't enough. Her mental health can't be a justification for everything. Both did wrong but only one destroyed something.\n\nThe violin was important to Mia. I don't think it got destroyed in the heat of the moment. Has Jamie told you why she destroyed it?", "NTA. Teaching that actions have consequences and that you're responsible for your actions, even if you're upset, is a good lesson. Mia should be punished as well though.", "NTA.\n\nBeing in therapy doesn't excuse you from consequences.  Words are different than actions.  She could have done many other things besides breaking an expensive item, not to mention the emotional attachment.  It's more than fair she have to pay back the cost of the item.  The other will be punished accordingly for her own actions, but the loss of property still must be repaid.  Any court would see is that way.", "NTA\n\nBoth messed up, both should receive a punishment.\n\nJamie should repay for the violin - no matter what people say, destroying their property is not ok.\n\nMia should be grounded, because bullying is not ok.", "What did Mia say to Jamie?", "Sisters fight and it sounds like this one got ugly, but letting Jaime off the hook for destroying something of value to her sister is not the way to help the situation. You can punish them both for the words said, but Jaime also needs to pay for a new or repaired violin. And if Mia feels like your husband is taking Jaime's side, that's going to breed resentment.", "NTA Jamie is in therapy. That does not give her a free pass for continued bad behavior. Without consequence, what is her incentive to change her behavior of the last 2.5 years? It sounds like this may be part of Mia's problem with Jamie. Is she often getting preferred treatment because she is \"in therapy\"?", "ESH.\n\n1. Jaime should pay for the violin (if she can\u2019t work for some reason, like being an academic emergency at school, it should come out of any allowance/birthday money/Christmas money she gets)\n\n2. Both children should be grounded for the argument. \n\n3. Jaime\u2019s therapy should be upped to more appointments per week if she can\u2019t control her anger\n\n4. Jaime and Mia should have to attend a group therapy session together to talk it out.", "NTA. IF the violin can be repaired, then Jaime should have to pay for it to be fixed. If it can't, then Jaime should have to buy a new violin. Jaime has to learn that actions have consequences, and even so when you're in therapy. Adults get arrested and charged with crimes even when they are having behavioral issues. No one has the right to resort to violence and destroy property because of mental disability. Not me, not you, not Jaime.", "NTA, but something needs to be done to address how Mia was needling Jamie to set her off. I think both of your daughters need therapy. It's quite common that the siblings of a child with special needs often have a lot of bitterness and anger for how much time their sibling is taking away from their parents. Jamie needs a consequence for her actions, but Mia also needs to learn how to deal with Jamie, and leaving her to her own devices when she's not even an adult isn't fair. She's 17, of course she doesn't know how to deal with someone with mental health issues.", "NTA, but both girls need to be punished, they must be shown that actions including words have consequences. Yes Jamie should be paying for the violin, if she broke something out in the public world under similar circumstances she would have to pay, mental health not with standing. Mia of course needs punishment also for whatever she said, she just didn't ramp it up with breaking stuff.", "Nta", "Jamie is 16, and no matter what was said, or what her current issues, it doesn't excuse her breaking something, intentionally, that held such sentimental value. your husband's suggestion is basically enabling. Jamie absolutely must have consequences for this, beyond therapy. NTA", "NTA. \nMental health isnt a get out of jail free card. \n\nBoth girls need to be punished for their behaviour. probably both need therapy together and separate ly. Dealing with a sibling mental health issues often causes worries and resentment which are over looked by parents who are focused on the child having the main issue.\n\nSounds like everything boiled over fir both of them.\n\nJamie needs to pay for the violin and you need to find a suitable punishment for mia.", "NTA.\n\nShe broke the violin and must learn that there are consequences for her actions.", "NTA\n\nPaying for items you destroy is a great natural consequence.  Having mental issues is not an excuse to break things.  Daughter's fight, they say things that hurt each other, both need to be in trouble.  Both need to work it out, and Jamie needs to pay back the cost of repair or replacement of the instrument.", "NTA  \n\n\nVoilins are expensive and it had sentimental value, she 100% needs to pay back the damages", "NTA. Jamie having mental health issues doesn\u2019t give her a free pass to do whatever she wants with no consequences.", "NTA.  If Jamie doesn\u2019t want to lose her money, maybe she shouldn\u2019t break people\u2019s stuff.  If she broke a stranger\u2019s stuff and ended up in court over it, the judge rightfully wouldn\u2019t care about her excuses or what she wants.", "So if Jamie went into a store and threw a tantrum and broke things.... do you think the store wouldn't require payment just because she's in therapy? There's your answer. She broke it - she needs to buy it!!", "If you break things or get violent instead of using your words, there needs to be consequences. We're civilized humans, not monkeys, and many people should learn that. NTA, I think replacing broken property is reasonable.", "NTA.  Of course Jamie does not want to pay for the irreplaceable keepsake of a deceased family member that she destroyed.  Nothing tastes sweeter than getting away with bad behavior while your victim suffers.  Your husband is setting Jamie up for failure as an adult.  If she learns that she can do whatever she wants within the family setting, she will eventually try that on other people that won't give her a pass.  This definitely needs to be addressed with the therapist, but Jamie needs to learn that her actions have consequences.", "Both daughters should be punished. You will only cause more resentment and enable this behaviour in the further.", "Just ground them. Simple as that. NAH", "She needs to pay to replace the violin. People have verbal arguments and fights. Sometimes the words get inappropriate. But once you escalate it to physical violence or property damage you are definitely now the one in the wrong. She can either come up with the money in a matter of her choosing or her items can be sold to cover the costs. As it is she can never 100% make it right since it was priceless to her sister. Might need to look at more therapy/different therapy because in a couple years this kind of behavior is going to have far greater consequences.", "YTA, for even cogitate the girl not paying for the violin.", "INFO: Was the violin out or in its case?", "ur husband sounds like a liberal sissy definitely not the asshole", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
