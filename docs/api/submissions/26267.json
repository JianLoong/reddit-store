Who i\u2019ll call Mia (17F) and Jaime (16F) (fake names).\n\nFor some background knowledge: \nMy SIL passed away 4 years ago due to cancer, Mia and SIL had a very close relationship. SIL played violin and Mia was interested in playing because of SIL. She was given SIL violin before she passed away.\n\nIts something Mia cherishes greatly.\n\nJaime has been having some setbacks in her behavior and mental health for the past 2.5 years. She\u2019s in therapy, and we\u2019ve had talks. She\u2019s been improving, although its slow. \nShe\u2019s been acting out a lot, arguing, yelling.\n\nMia and Jamie aren\u2019t close, but they usually don\u2019t argue. \n\nNow for the issue at hand\n\nMia and Jamie were arguing about something, that changed into multiple different topics. \nMia made constant jabs at Jamie about stuff she was dealing with. In return, Jamie broke the violin.\n\nMy husband and I were not home when it happened. Jamie admitted to breaking the violin because of what Mia said.\n\nMia is obviously distraught. She\u2019s even more upset with Jamie now.\n\nI\u2019m not defending either daughters, they both said and did stuff they weren\u2019t supposed to. And I do believe both daughters should be punished. \n\nFor Jamies punishment my husband and I cannot agree if Jamie should repay Mia for the violin.  I believe she should, though a new violin won\u2019t make up for the emotional aspect of SILs violin. Jamie doesn\u2019t want to pay Mia back.\n\nHowever my husband doesn\u2019t think she should because of what Mia said. Saying that Jamie is still in therapy so we shouldn\u2019t punish her for what she does, just take her to therapy and talk it out.\n\nHe thinks i\u2019m the AH because Mia started it, and because Jamie doesn\u2019t want to lose her money.

Is repairing it not feasible?", "NTA \n\nShe should pay for the new violin AND both sisters should have some therapy together to talk it out.\n\nEdit: if the violin can be repaired Jamie should pay for that instead.", "NTA - Difficult because I can see your husband's point about Mia's provocation however he's completely wrong about there should be no consequences for Jamie, she needs to understand that violence and destroying other people's things is absolutely never acceptable. If she gets away with this she'll learn that she can use her issues to get away with things and you'll be setting yourselves up for a world of trouble.\n\nI think the answer is you have to clearly punish both girls. Jamie should absolutely have to pay Mia back for the violin, however, Mia must also receive a punishment fitting her actions and Jamie has to see her being punished also. Both girls should be required to apologise to one another too. If you're still unsure perhaps you can disucss it with her therapist first and take her suggetsion on board.", "NTA\nIf you're concerned with Jamies mental health, maybe you could give her therapist a heads up. Can Jamie and Mia have a session with a therapist to talk about everything?\n\nJamie should pay for a new violin. Actions have consequences and it's a lesson she is going to learn the hard way. Sometimes a sorry isn't enough. Her mental health can't be a justification for everything. Both did wrong but only one destroyed something.\n\nThe violin was important to Mia. I don't think it got destroyed in the heat of the moment. Has Jamie told you why she destroyed it?", "NTA. Teaching that actions have consequences and that you're responsible for your actions, even if you're upset, is a good lesson. Mia should be punished as well though.", "NTA.\n\nBeing in therapy doesn't excuse you from consequences.  Words are different than actions.  She could have done many other things besides breaking an expensive item, not to mention the emotional attachment.  It's more than fair she have to pay back the cost of the item.  The other will be punished accordingly for her own actions, but the loss of property still must be repaid.  Any court would see is that way.", "NTA\n\nBoth messed up, both should receive a punishment.\n\nJamie should repay for the violin - no matter what people say, destroying their property is not ok.\n\nMia should be grounded, because bullying is not ok.", "What did Mia say to Jamie?", "Sisters fight and it sounds like this one got ugly, but letting Jaime off the hook for destroying something of value to her sister is not the way to help the situation. You can punish them both for the words said, but Jaime also needs to pay for a new or repaired violin. And if Mia feels like your husband is taking Jaime's side, that's going to breed resentment.", "NTA Jamie is in therapy. That does not give her a free pass for continued bad behavior. Without consequence, what is her incentive to change her behavior of the last 2.5 years? It sounds like this may be part of Mia's problem with Jamie. Is she often getting preferred treatment because she is \"in therapy\"?", "ESH.\n\n1. Jaime should pay for the violin (if she can\u2019t work for some reason, like being an academic emergency at school, it should come out of any allowance/birthday money/Christmas money she gets)\n\n2. Both children should be grounded for the argument. \n\n3. Jaime\u2019s therapy should be upped to more appointments per week if she can\u2019t control her anger\n\n4. Jaime and Mia should have to attend a group therapy session together to talk it out.", "NTA. IF the violin can be repaired, then Jaime should have to pay for it to be fixed. If it can't, then Jaime should have to buy a new violin. Jaime has to learn that actions have consequences, and even so when you're in therapy. Adults get arrested and charged with crimes even when they are having behavioral issues. No one has the right to resort to violence and destroy property because of mental disability. Not me, not you, not Jaime.", "NTA, but something needs to be done to address how Mia was needling Jamie to set her off. I think both of your daughters need therapy. It's quite common that the siblings of a child with special needs often have a lot of bitterness and anger for how much time their sibling is taking away from their parents. Jamie needs a consequence for her actions, but Mia also needs to learn how to deal with Jamie, and leaving her to her own devices when she's not even an adult isn't fair. She's 17, of course she doesn't know how to deal with someone with mental health issues.", "NTA, but both girls need to be punished, they must be shown that actions including words have consequences. Yes Jamie should be paying for the violin, if she broke something out in the public world under similar circumstances she would have to pay, mental health not with standing. Mia of course needs punishment also for whatever she said, she just didn't ramp it up with breaking stuff.", "Nta", "Jamie is 16, and no matter what was said, or what her current issues, it doesn't excuse her breaking something, intentionally, that held such sentimental value. your husband's suggestion is basically enabling. Jamie absolutely must have consequences for this, beyond therapy.

Dealing with a sibling mental health issues often causes worries and resentment which are over looked by parents who are focused on the child having the main issue.\n\nSounds like everything boiled over fir both of them.\n\nJamie needs to pay for the violin and you need to find a suitable punishment for mia.", "NTA.\n\nShe broke the violin and must learn that there are consequences for her actions.", "NTA\n\nPaying for items you destroy is a great natural consequence.  Having mental issues is not an excuse to break things.  Daughter's fight, they say things that hurt each other, both need to be in trouble.  Both need to work it out, and Jamie needs to pay back the cost of repair or replacement of the instrument.", "NTA  \n\n\nVoilins are expensive and it had sentimental value, she 100% needs to pay back the damages", "NTA. Jamie having mental health issues doesn\u2019t give her a free pass to do whatever she wants with no consequences.", "NTA.  If Jamie doesn\u2019t want to lose her money, maybe she shouldn\u2019t break people\u2019s stuff.  If she broke a stranger\u2019s stuff and ended up in court over it, the judge rightfully wouldn\u2019t care about her excuses or what she wants.", "So if Jamie went into a store and threw a tantrum and broke things.... do you think the store wouldn't require payment just because she's in therapy? There's your answer. She broke it - she needs to buy it!!", "If you break things or get violent instead of using your words, there needs to be consequences. We're civilized humans, not monkeys, and many people should learn that. NTA, I think replacing broken property is reasonable.", "NTA.  Of course Jamie does not want to pay for the irreplaceable keepsake of a deceased family member that she destroyed.  Nothing tastes sweeter than getting away with bad behavior while your victim suffers.  Your husband is setting Jamie up for failure as an adult.  If she learns that she can do whatever she wants within the family setting, she will eventually try that on other people that won't give her a pass.  This definitely needs to be addressed with the therapist, but Jamie needs to learn that her actions have consequences.", "Both daughters should be punished. You will only cause more resentment and enable this behaviour in the further.", "Just ground them. Simple as that. NAH", "She needs to pay to replace the violin. People have verbal arguments and fights. Sometimes the words get inappropriate. But once you escalate it to physical violence or property damage you are definitely now the one in the wrong. She can either come up with the money in a matter of her choosing or her items can be sold to cover the costs. As it is she can never 100% make it right since it was priceless to her sister.

Stop excusing her behavior.", "INFO: Do you know how much the violin is worth? The range of price for a full-size violin is anywhere from $500-$500,000+. If your SIL was a professional violinist, it\u2019s likely the instrument is worth in the $10,000-$100,000 range. I just don\u2019t know that your daughter could realistically pay that back.\n\nNow, if it was a $500-$1000 (maybe even a bit more), that is more reasonable for a teen to pay back, but I think it would be insane for a teen to have to pay for a $10,000+ instrument, even if they were at fault. \n\nBoth kids need consequences. Perhaps Jaime should pay back a set amount for the violin or do something that encourages Mia\u2019s pursuits (paying for lessons for a bit, paying for accessories like music stands and sheet music , etc) and Mia should do something that supports Jaime\u2019s mental health struggles (buying her comfort items, paying for Jaime and a friend or parent to have a mental health day, etc). \n\nThey\u2019re kids. They need consequences, I think just not the pay $100,000+ type\u2026\n\nETA: luthier repairs for violins are EXPENSIVE. If it\u2019s a cheaper violin, and depending on damages, it may cost WAY more than the monetary \u201cvalue\u201d of the violin to repair. And you must get a violin luthier - one who repairs other instruments may not even have the specialized tools for working on a violin. If it\u2019s not a crazy amount, may be worth it for the sentimental value, but baseline repairs/maintenance for my instrument costs me at least $200-300 a year, and I get a discount from a luthier friend who does tons of little things for me for free. If you\u2019re getting actual repairs for damage, costs may go up to the thousands.", "I was think, who was it that was said to have made a couple of guitars for Joni. d\u2019oh. It was a character in a book by Jonathan Kellerman.", "Part of growing up is taking responsibility for Mia= apologizing and for Jamie= paying for the replacement.  Not teaching this will for Jamie a disservice since in the real world she will be expected to do such.", "Mental health is not a get out of jail free card: even those who plead insanity get locked up, one way or another. Conseequences are consequences. If Jaime had done this as an adult, and if the damage was valued over a certain amount, it\u2019d be a felony. And her defense would be\u2026 \u201cshe said something mean\u201d? Siblings can drive us all up the wall, even the good ones. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t entitle us to break shit. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA, destruction of personal property is way beyond saying mean things to each other.  I would suggest taking the violin to a luthier to determine if it can be repaired at all, even if it's just enough to use as a display piece in a shadow box.  And any costs can be paid back by Jamie over a specific period of time.  That way Mia has her aunt's violin to keep & Jamie doesn't have to pay a big chunk of money all at once.  \n\nAs far as punishing Mia, it sounds as if she might also need some counseling or therapy too.  I wonder if she's got some resentment towards Jamie for \"getting more attention\", or maybe she's hearing snide/snarky comments from her peers at school about Jamie.  \n\nAside from the violin, you & your husband really should bring this incident up with Jamie's therapist - losing her temper to the point of physical destruction is alarming, IMO.  What's next - grabbing a lamp & hitting whoever has made her angry?  Not good at all.  \n\nI hope you all can get this worked out, sending blessings your way!", "Have you taken it to a luthier to see if it any of it can be salvaged? This needs to happen first. You\u2019d be surprised what a skilled luthier can accomplish. Jamie needs to pay for the repairs or a new violin. No matter what her mental health is like right now she needs to understand as a young adult her actions have consequences. You would not be doing your part as her parents if you did not do this. Mia also needs to be held accountable. At minimum they both need family counseling and she needs consequences. You cannot let her be this awful to someone, anyone. Especially family. This is not going to serve her as an adult. NTA for wanting consequences but BOTH girls need them and Y W B T A if they didn\u2019t get them.", "Therapy can take years and years, is your husband just going to ignore every bad thing she does while she's in therapy as an excuse?  This is ridiculous.  NTAH.", "YTA.  Both daughters need to be punished but Mia should not be rewarded for her actions by receiving a new violin.  Make them both earn the money to repair that violin, with Mia needing to earn at least 40% of the cost because of the insults and being the instigator.", "NTA. She should face a consequence. I'm sure Mia said something terrible but that doesn't justify the destruction of property.", "As the OP reads, NTA.\n\nBut it depends on quite a few things.  Is there constant animosity between the two then this may just have been the straw that broke the camel's back?\n\nJaime broke the violin and should be paying back the cost to repair.  Otherwise you pay and Jaime pays you back which might come in the form of less allowance or cheaper presents.\n\nBut if Mia is regularly mean to Jaime and it's Jaime that had snapped under that pressure... then the broken violin is a consequence of her behaviour.\n\nIt does depend on the whole context of what has been happening at home.  Having mental health issues doesn't give you a free pass and nor everything defers to the unwell person.  Reality is that the whole family is affected.  It may be that you can't all go out because one won't cope so one parent stays home and the other takes the other two to experience the fun stuff so they don't miss out.  But it's not quite the same.\n\nSometimes the one with the issues takes it out on the other kids which is never okay.  There may be a neurodiversity (diagnosed or undiagnosed) on top which complicates things (normal discipline doesn't work as well or at all - the behaviour keeps repeated no matter what the consequences are).\n\nJaime and Mia's relationship isn't very good at the moment.  Therapy with the two of them  probably won't help at this point.  Jaime already probably has a therapist but Mia probably would benefit from one if she's willing to talk to someone.  It may be an external person who she can tell her story to who may be able to give her some strategies to cope with a mentally unwell sibling.  Both how to protect herself and how to not make Jaime worse and also may explain (but not excuse) where some of that is coming from.\n\nI wouldn't be pushing them together because at this point it will probably drive them apart further.  Worst part is that Mia and Jaime could have a really close relationship and be best friends but that may never happen and someone is going to be lonely if they also have a not so good relationship with friends.\n\nOne day they may become close.  Your husband shouldn't enable Jaime as much as he is.  But Mia shouldn't be punished more because she's not unwell.\n\nJaime will eventually learn that her actions do have consequences.  And Mia needs to learn that too.", "Your husband is teaching Jamie that that breaking peoples stuff for her feelings getting hurt is a valid response.

Probably both girls need to be grounded for a couple of weeks or a month.\n\n> Saying that Jamie is still in therapy so we shouldn\u2019t punish her for what she does, just take her to therapy and talk it out.\n\nWell, ask the therapist their opinion. No, I'm serious. Ask the therapist what sort of consequence is reasonable. I doubt the therapist will be on board with this \"no consequences\" plan, and their word will have more weight with your husband than AITA's.\n\nNTA.", "Not encouraging Jamie to payback a violin in an altercation that hadn't been physical until she acted would set a poor standard for the household where Jamie can be violent if someone isn't walking on egg shells with her. I realize that's a bit of an extreme portrayal given Mia said hurtful things, but the fact is that's how it would ultimately wind up.\n\nNTA if you make her pay back a violin.", "NTA. I agree they both need some consequences and Jamie's should be to pay for the violin to be repaired or replaced.  Your husband's attitude of \"...therapy so we shouldn\u2019t punish her for what she does...\" honestly just enables bad behavior if she's never held accountable for things because she's in therapy.

Smashed instruments are harder, but even then, a good luthier can fix a heck of a lot of damage.", "Without knowing what Mia said it's sort of impossible to get a well reasoned response.\n\nI have 2 teen girls and I was the eldest of 5 girls, I know when they argue they can hit really low, saying things that most adults would never say. There are things I can imagine a teen girl saying about her sisters ongoing mental health struggles that I think are truly disgusting. \n\nI guess if you won't detail what Mia said my advice would be that if Mia crossed the line from arguing to bullying her sister over her mental health then I personally don't think she should get the violin replaced. Both girls should get the same punishment for fighting with the additional loss of the violin being Mia's consequence for being a bully.", "Well, this is important context.\n\nDoes Mia also need therapy? Or more attention and more time for her? If family life over the past few years has been centered around Jamie's needs, that seems likely.", "If Jamie has to pay for the violin, what's Mia's punishment going to be? If you just punish Jamie it's going to look like you favour Mia and she can say what she wants and get away with it.", "Probably why she has behavior problems.", "Then you need to go with your husband and talk to Jamie's therapist.

Her husband IS actually trying so I give him some leeway. \nJaime being in therapy is not an excuse, but honestly what Mia expected how it would end? She pushed and pushed and pushed.
