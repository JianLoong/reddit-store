Also, a bit manipulative.  Why isn't your husband factoring in how you feel? Apart from everything else, you live there, too.", "NTA \n\nT is toxic, and if you let him live with you he will cause you a lot of problems and probably never leave.", "NTA.  Do you want someone who can't hold a job, drive, and has been living off their parent all this time? You will never get them out of your home! Yes, feel terrible for their situation but you are not responsible for them, nor should they expect you to be. T is being super manipulative. You and hubby are just 2 people who are sympathetic to someone plight, it doesn't necessitate inviting them into your home for an open ended stay.", "NTA.  Don't do it.  He doesn't have a job.  Won't get a job.  No car.  No license. His father is toxic to him because he is just sitting around at home doing nothing but costing money that he doesn't earn.  Do you really want that in your house?  He'll be piled up on your couch and will be another mouth to feed and clean up after.  You'll have to listen to his pathetic self 24/7.  Save yourself and your marriage and make this a hill to die on.", "NTA\n\nT is an acquaintance to you, not a dear friend.  Some people thrive on drama, and it sounds like T is one of those people.\n\n\"He doesn\u2019t have a job, won\u2019t get a job\"\n\nThey dug their own hole.", "NTA if T is a problem as a Facebook friend I can\u2019t even imagine what would happen in person.  There is probably a good reason T got kicked out and you don\u2019t need that in your life.  They have no income, no transportation, and would have no incentive to ever leave.  You do not need that.  Guilt is a powerful motivator don\u2019t fall for it in this case.", "NTA. And by the sound of it, if you do let him start living with you, good luck getting him to move out afterward. T doesn't seem like a very good person to have around the house, especially since as someone that doesn't have a job and apparently has no motivation to improve their situation in life, they would probably be a horrible example to young kids.", "NTA. T sounds like a problem\u2026and not YOUR problem. The well being of your marriage and family has to take priority over T\u2019s needs.", "Honestly, the background info about him being trans is pretty immaterial to the plot of this story.   Whatever the gender you appear to have some rando friend who've neither of you have seen in years?  Due to some circumstances way beyond anything in your sphere of influence, you have to put this dude up?  Hard pass on that.  NTA \n\nThese are the kinds of things where one has to ask questions and set up very strict boundaries if you do say \"yes\" \n\n1. How long is he staying? \n2. will he pay rent? \n3. Do you even have room?  Where precisely will he stay? \n\nAnd these are the kinds of questions I'd be asking for a really good friend, who I've known for years, and see often.  This is some barely-above-a-facebook-friend old acquaintance.    The mind reels with downsides. \n\nPlus you have kids?? \"Hey kids, here's uncle Rando who you've never met before.  He'll be living with us for the next year, or two, or three\".", "Let me say - I am also a trans man who lived with an abusive FIL for a while and would have been homeless if a friend didn't take us in.\n\nHowever I still say NTA. T sounds like he would be a bit too much to handle. I get he's your husband's friend but you have little ones to worry about as well in this situation.", "NTA \n\nIt's unfortunate but this would likely end your marriage. He's got nothing to contribute but an entitled attitude.", "No, no, no, no, no (I could go on). He doesn't have a job so he will not be able to pay rent, utilities, groceries, nothing. He expects you to financially support him. \n\nHe's full of drama so he will ruin any peace you have in your house. Everything will be about him and whatever perceived slight has happened that day. Moreover, you will be expected to cater to all his emotional needs, all the time. \n\nYour husband should never offer up your joint home to anyone without speaking to you about it first. And he definitely should not allow someone to move in who will contribute nothing positive.\n\nT and husband are AHs, you are NTA.", "Bringing an unemployed stranger you only know online to live with your kids woild have been an actually insane thing to do. NTA", "NTA. T is for trouble. How is he going to contribute to the household and his own living expenses if he won't get a job? Your husband is inviting a stranger who is a mooch into your household without getting any agreement from you. This is going be a disaster that will end very unpleasantly. T is going to cause all kind of dramatics and you and husband are always going to be the bad guys. If your husband insists on letting him in it will lead to a huge stress that your marriage may not survive. If you have doubts now, wait till after he's there and there is no escape from him.", "NTA -- don't let them move in. They will never leave.", "Yeah NTA. First of all, declining to do someone a massive favor is never wrong - it\u2019s a favor, not an obligation. \n\nSecond, to save them from a problem visibly of their own making is never, again, an obligation. It\u2019s ok to say no when you know their request is gonna cause problems in your own life. We are all allowed to tell a dog owner to stop leaving their shit on our lawns, figuratively speaking.\n\nThis all applies if your read of T is correct, btw. If you tweaked some facts to make them look worse, well, that\u2019s on you.\n\nA final note: I don\u2019t find it appropriate for people to demand of their spouse their acceptance for inviting someone they don\u2019t know well to live in the house. \u201cIt\u2019s my house too\u201d is not valid.", "This would be a deal breaker for me.
