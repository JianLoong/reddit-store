I assume you're doing the best you can.  \n\n\nIf you do follow up on this, we usually use 72 hours (3 days) for minimum advance notice for short-notice changes.  The thinking is that people rarely make good decisions on-the-spot and need time to work things out.  It prevents emotional decisions and be pressured in the moment.\n\nChanges in parenting days often require a minimum of 1 week's advance notice, usually 2 weeks.\n\nAnd parents are usually asked to keep conversations to text or email, so that conversations can be tracked if they need to go to court or arbitration.  That eliminates the \"he said / she said\" of changing memories in voice conversations.  \n\n\nHope that helps!", "Did you get a certificate of baptism? Normally, it has to be issued by the parish and as everyone says, they usually only do these at the church or they can come to the hospital if the child is sick.", "Personally I'd be freaking out. I don't necessarily believe in black magic or voodoo, but those who practice it Isiah don't have the most honorable intentions. Possibly look into talking to a lawyer? IDK of anything can be done to keep your child away from that kind of stuff, but at least a lawyer might be able to tell you what you can do.", "Convert to Pastafarianism and see if  they have any form of baptism", "What part? The lack of communication or the lack of permission?\n\nHe should have communicated but he didn't do any harm to the kids.\n\nUnless religion or grandparents have any legal implications he doesn't need your permission", "Maybe the kids dad wanted to baptize to protect them from the black magic?  But why not in a church.", "mainly because black magic isn't a thing.", "They have the exact amount of rights when it comes to religion. OP can't tell him he can't baptize the kids. Because she doesn't have more rights than the ex. Simple.\n\nI know plenty of people who didn't suffer any emotional damage due to religion. My partner for instance (I also didn't, but I didn't live in a religious household so I'm not considering myself in the equation).", "Then how did he have them present if this was during your parenting time.", "Of course he did.  Why would he schedule it on her parenting time?  It is something he wants no matter how weird it sounds.  \n\nHe can choose to take them to church just like she can on her time.\n\nHe can pick babysitters and friends just like she can on her time.\n\nShe doesn't get to override his choices just because it isn't what she would do.", "Send CPS there.", "Nope you didn't say they're not his but youre sure acting like they only belong to you. \n\nYou're posting in AITA and complaint when someone doesn't agree with you... Pmsl", "HE IS A PARENT TOO! It's not that hard to understand, you don't get to dictate everything. Christ how dense are you?", "I was notified a day prior to the event . That was planned on my day with the kids", "I would personally un-baptize them and make a huge show if it on social media so everyone knew....", "Right. This is important information. Did his family push the baptism? Because in a lot of latam, baptizing children catholic is just what you do. (Source: I was born and live in latam). Still, the situation is weird all over, and my greatest concern would be what it means for those strangers who are now the kids' godparents. Did they get any rights with it or something?", "Honestly I was stuck. He was abusive and controlling I was dealing with DV and control and manipulation for many years I finally got to courage to get away a couple years ago and he opened up a case . It was a whole thing", "You're right. A proper Catholic baptism is generally always performed in a church or by the parish priest at home but only in certain circumstances and you're also right about not baptizing non-Catholics. You don't necessarily need to be a regular church goer, but you do need to be a member of the local church or have the local priest send a recommendation if the sacraments will be performed in different parishes.", "In an emergency situation (fear of imminent death, etc), anyone can baptize anywhere, according to Catholic rules. All you need is water and the words.", "Yeah I seen them receive half sheet certificates at the end I didn\u2019t not see them prior and did not sign anything saying I was ok with this being certified", "He just told me he \u201cwas from over seas and he paid him to come \u201c after the fact", "You\u2019re absolutely correct", "I consider myself agnostic , I grew up going to Christian Saturdays school as a kid, going to catholic funerals only. Then as a tween my mom tried Jehovahs witness, honestly couldn\u2019t say any of them made me figure out god any better . So I feel agnostic is the best word for what I believe.", "It really did Thankyou", "They did not give one to me no.", "Also they didn\u2019t shake hands with me at the end like I felt un included in the entire event tbh.", "Voodoo is a whole religion. Its much more than the Hollywood version of poking dolls and sacrificing chickens. It is not synonymous with black magic or ill intentions", "yeah, who cares? If he was doing any harm to the kid, like circumcision, that would have been different. But nothing was done to the kid so who cares?", "You have to paint a noodle on the forehead of the accepting with starchy spaghetti water.  \n\n\nRAmen", "Yeah that\u2019s a thought I had too! \n\nBut indeed, if it were to protect them from any Uhm\u2026 \u201cstray black magic darts\u201d then why not do it in a real church setting. \n\nWhich had me consider the possibility of maybe them using some kind of backwards spin on an actual Catholic (sounding) ritual? It would sound official to a layperson, but actually be an opposite ritual of the real baptism. Not sure if that\u2019s possible - don\u2019t know enough about it. Wouldn\u2019t put it past them though.", "Just because it isn\u2019t recognized by western society doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a thing.", "Not understanding your question. He called me the day before the event and asked me if it would be ok I specifically followed up by asking him if it would be at his home. Because 1 his family is not reliant all and that made me wonder , 2 his father is into black magic and I knew they would try to do something like this , to \u201cbless the children\u201d or something his father uses a lot of holy water in his practices. It\u2019s super deep and he\u2019s to explain cause you were not personally around the household like I was", "I\u2019ve thought about it but I\u2019m just worried it\u2019ll go nowhere", "How can you determine that\u2019s how I act ultimately from one issue I\u2019ve had ?", "You\u2019re missing the point I think . That\u2019s ok everybody is entitled to their own opinion and I respect yours . Thankyou for your input", "You should have said no, not on your day with the kids. Or you should have been responsible for bringing them to the event where you would have realized this was not what you thought was happening. You had a choice here and while you were lied to, you still allowed this to happen on your custody time so you played a role in it as well", "Ok so you was still told and you still brought them over so why are you mad that they got baptized you could have said no", "You need to stand your ground you said it was ok he lied ESH", "I understand the abuse and being trapped.  I am happy you got away.  Is there a way you can protect your children from him?  I know they won't listen to witchcraft, but use the abuse?", "Take them to a priest for his opinion. The paperwork can't be legitimate either. The Catholic Church takes a dim view of this sort  of thing", "That's okay, a visiting priest can still make arrangements to perform a baptism at your local parish. The fact that this one didn't tells me this is not legit. He lied to you about where the baptism was taking place. He's still lying.", "Yeah, I see this all the time. See if you can get a psych evaluation through the courts based on this scenario. Do you have a lawyer?", "Ill intentions indeed", "I'd love that. Considering the love I have for pasta maybe my parents actually did that when I was a kid xD", "My initial reaction to this was, everyone knows what a baptism entails so it isn't likely they could pass off some weird ceremony as a baptism.  Then I realized they aren't religious and not everyone has been to tons of baptisms and studied the practice so maybe?  I mean one of the key parts is to deny the power of Satan and his empty promises (paraphrasing) on behalf of the child explicitly.  And the godparents have to say a creed from the Bible usually.  But if they just promised the kids to their supreme god it could be anything I suppose.", "I don't care about western or eastern. Black magic isn't a thing. An imaginary being in the sky isn't a thing either. Just like growing a coin from behind's a child's ear also isn't a thing. You can perform all the hocus pocus you want in a child. It makes absolutely no difference.", "If you knew this then it is something that should have been brought up with the courts during the custody discussions and have rules put into place. In the absence of any rules about religion then he can choose to do what he wants to do.\n\nJust like you can.  \n\nAlso as a note, not all religions require that baptisms take place in a church.  They can be done in homes, rivers, hospitals, parks.....anyplace really.", "And you\u2019re not wrong , I agree with you for the most part I could have said no and should have. But seeing how exited my girls were for it made me feel bad. Assuming my kids knew about it already and had extravagant dressed picked out already. \nTheir father and grandmother made me feel ambushed to be honest .", "The problem is when I was with him I never made any police reports about the abuse . So it all got swept under the rug in court. His father also hired the lawyer that fought the case on his end and it was an asswhooping I\u2019ll tell ya", "Exactly. Sounds murky as hell to me. No pun intended.", "Haha, well at least we are in agreement about the imaginary being in the sky. \ud83d\ude07\n\nThere are enough angles to this topic to write a thesis\u2026 but hey, if that\u2019s your bottom line and you\u2019re happy with it, I\u2019m happy for you.", "I don't blame you for not saying no. It's called compromise. You can tell them that next time any changes have to be approved in advance or something like that.\n\nBut you are way overreacting over this whole black magic thing... -.-", "You need to find your north pole. Decide what you believe and then enforce your rules. Even if your black magic-practicing FIL has recruited total strangers to guide your children through their spiritual journey. Even if your girls are excited to be offered up as brides of Satan, or whatever happened in that ceremony.\n\nSeriously, what else will you allow to happen to your girls just because someone else wanted it? Grow a backbone and start protecting your children."]}
