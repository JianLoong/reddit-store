That said, African enslaved people brought the religion to Cuba, where it merged with the Catholic faith there, and then on to Mexico, where it's merged and evolved somewhat again, but still enmeshed with the Catholic faith.\n\nFrom the [newworldencyclopedia.com](https://newworldencyclopedia.com) entry on Santeria: \n\n>The birth of Santeria in Cuba was primarily due to this convergence of Yor\u00f9b\u00e1's religiosity and Catholicism. When slave owners observed Africans celebrating a Saint's Day, they were generally unaware that the slaves were actually worshiping the Orisha. The slaves' Christian masters did not allow them to practice their various west African religions; however, the slaves found a way around this by masking the Orishas as Christian saints while maintaining their original identities. Today, the terms saint and Orisha are sometimes used interchangeably in the Santeria community. The common bond between the Lukum\u00ed Orisha and the Catholic saints has become a part of Cuba's religious culture. The word Santer\u00eda (Way of the Saints) was originally a derisive term applied by the Spanish to mock followers' seeming over devotion to the saints and their perceived neglect of God.\n\nWhile there are some practices in Santeria that may seem like witchcraft, it's simply super ritualistic.... they believe in one Eternal power (God, or Olodumare), and don't really adhere to the idea of \"Satan\" or a black and white version of good versus evil. Many of the rituals involve animal sacrifice, which frankly is why I think a lot of white Christians think it's barbaric/witchcraft/black magic, but generally speaking, blood sacrifice is pretty common in many religions, including Christianity (ffs, the entire religion is named after the victim of the ultimate blood sacrifice). \n\nAnd just like \\*any\\* religion/belief structure, there are people practicing it in good faith and with good intentions, just like there are people who are not. That includes Christianity, Wicca, Santeria, and most any other religion on the planet.", "There is no rooting of any sort of witchcraft in Christianity. All witchcraft is anti Catholic in the strongest sense. I don't really care about black or white. It's all evil.", "Right? That is exactly what I was thinking.

I would suggest that if you want your kids Baptised in eithe the Catholic Church or a Protestant Church you talk to the dad and arrang\u00f7 for anotherBaptism.  Getting Baptised multiple times is not going to hurt the Child andwill produce a document to show Baptism in eithe denomination.  Just think about it.", "Well, I had a million dollars", "Yeah I guess .

I would also use this as a way to get what is needed when ex has the kids, and you have something planned. This should go both ways.", "Technically, untrue, but the Church likes to to avoid nasty recrimination, potential civil suits which come to nothing but cost cash, etc.  None of my friends who are priests would deny such a baptism.", "Not so sure. But I think you need to officially leave the religion. I heard it\u2019s somewhat complicated too because the church of course doesn\u2019t want to lose patrons (and revenue)", "Very fair comment", "It\u2019s used for divination, to cast away negative energies, & cleansing but I strictly remember him telling the people that would come to throw these eggs near people houses they were using the egg for in which they wanted bad things to happen to them.", "Thankyou I appreciate you realizing the problem at hand", "Yeah maybe I should edit this to witchcraft instead of black magic cause people are hating that I used that word", "Santeria and Catholicism do go hand in hand in many places since each \u201cOrisha\u201d is represented by a Saint.

My ex and I agreed on some changes to when we had kids on certain holiday time.  One of us had certain ones odd years and the other even years.  One year, this one holiday he ended up having to work all weekend.  I asked him to trade years and he agreed.  But when he married his third wife (I was no. 1) she tried to take it on herself to decide for us when we would have the kids each.  So the next time I would have had the kids they made sure not to be home.  I called and called but cell phones were not great back then and when I did get him on the phone he said his wife told him this and that on the visitation business.  I told him we made an agreement and she had no say.  But I added that from this time forward we would stick to the visitation.  I was madder than a wet hen.  But later on down the road, on my weekend, his family was preparing for his father's funeral.  I let the kids stay with dad because it was their grandfather and all.  During the weekend, they had errands to run so I met them and got the kids for a couple of hours and then they went home with dad.  So I do understand that issue very well.  \n\nMy ex and I shared legal custody--decision making.  He never really discussed things with me about the kids.  (NOTE: When we divorced, I agreed to let him have the kids because the school system was where my daughter had been going since childhood but also because I could not win the custody in court and we would have been back and forth for years because he did not want to pay child support. I got a lot of back lash from people that did not understand I wanted my kids to not have to deal with that.)  He had our son tested for Autism at 11 but failed to let me know the appointments changed to earlier and did it without my knowledge.  The step mom was very new to the situation (barely 3 years married to my ex) and did not know my kids at all and they took her word for things.  So I understand from that point as well.   Needless to say, she wore the pants in the family.
