The more information you have the better you will feel and the better you can be there for your kids.", "Well worst case scenario is, he baptized the kids because he\u2019s planning on doing something sacrificial. Typically in black magic rituals, you offer \u201cblood of an innocent\u201d which roughly translates to a child. By the child being saved he may see it as a way to save their souls from eternal damnation. \n\nBest case scenario is he\u2019s just doing it because he\u2019s having a change of heart?", "Well, yeah, but sadly no court will care if the kids are being indoctrinated into a \"mainstream\" religion.", "You get it.", "Well actually four is because they're able to remember. I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nBut I mean you're supposed to get baptized again, if you got baptized the wrong way, anyway it says that in scripture so I don't see what the fuss is about.", "Could be hoodoo/voodoo or Santeria. Pretty weird but often common in the southern US or South America, the Caribbean, etc etc", "If there's Catholicism at the root, I'm assuming they practice some form/version of Santeria, which is pretty common (and the two pretty enmeshed) in Mexico. I personally wouldn't call it \"black magic,\" and most of the practitioners I know don't consider it that, but outsiders, particularly white outsiders, often do.", "It's definitely not Catholicism, though. Witchcraft of any sort is a big no no. And you can tell this was not a Catholic baptism because it was done at a house. Catholic baptisms are always, always done at the church, unless the person is in the hospital or something.", "And that matters why?", "If the Baptism was by an actual Catholic priest, it should have been preceded by classes for both parents, and take place in a church, usually during mass (location exception for dangerously ill infant or similar emergency circumstances).\n\nAny actual Catholic priest that performed this ceremony should be reported to the bishop of your local diocese for discipline.\n\nGet the Baptism certificate OP, as it will have the info you need. (They probably don't have one).\n\nIf these people are claiming it's a Catholic baptism, then the \"godparents\" should be also be reported to their own local parish. This is excommunication level stuff.\n\nMy guess is that it is not any kind of baptism in the eyes of the Catholic church. NTA and if you are a practicing Catholic, feel free to schedule a baptism in the Church that includes the Godparents of your choosing.", "Did an actual priest get inside the trailer to perform this?\nIf not , it was more symbolic and it's now on him and Godparents to guide the children and teach them the religion.", "Santer\u00eda?", "Right and a priest would have to speak to BOTH parents. Especially for the records and registration in Their Diocese", "Yeah. This post is an overwrought nothing burger. She needs to get over it and move on.", "This is straight up bigotry. You don\u2019t know anything about things like voodoo and you\u2019re calling practitioners dishonorable. What\u2019s wrong with you.", "I know a lot but I don\u2019t understand everything . What an arrogant comment", "That was creepy to ready id love to know more so I couldn\u2019t be less worried though haha", "Fair point", "But I thought Santeria WAS witchcraft and not something entwined w God fearing beliefs, yet you mention that in Mexico they are enmeshed, can you explain? For my own info plz? As I am thoroughly confused now. Ty. \ud83e\udd79", "I went to Catholic school, I\u2019m very aware that Brujer\u00eda isn\u2019t *catholicism* itself, but she keeps saying it\u2019s black magic, when in reality brujer\u00eda is very rooted in Christianity and Catholicism cause of those pesky \u201cmissionaries\u201d. Calling it black magic is flat out wrong, and i highly suspect it is Brujer\u00eda since she said her sons grandfather is from Ixtapa where it\u2019s more commonly practiced. She\u2019s making some gross assumptions calling it black magic is all I\u2019m saying. Black magic implies it\u2019s some evil scary witchy thing when it\u2019s, again, HEAVILY rooted in Christianity.", "It was a joke.", "Think OP\u2019s husband was maybe raised in one of the Santer\u00eda traditions?", "Honestly it\u2019s hard to know because of the language barrier which everyone is very aware of with me being a non Spanish speaker . What\u2019s exactly is Latam?", "At first I was going to say... no church will baptize a child without permission from both parents. If it's found out that a child was baptized without a parent's permission (someone lied, someone was coerced, etc.), the wrongful party could be banned from the church. At least this is how it works in most Catholic churches.\n\nBut this sounds like a slapdash ceremony in Hillbilly Land. Nothing official or anything that can be taken seriously. Consider filing for sole custody though because this sounds like a horror movie in the making.", "A dude in priest clothes came . Don\u2019t know how authentic he was because didn\u2019t hire the guy myself . Did the entire ceremony and what not .", "Wouldn\u2019t be surprised", "I don\u2019t think I would have allowed it for my kids tbh. But at least you were present I suppose. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You're correct. I did the research and apologize if I offended anyone.", "You're absolutely correct. I fell into the Hollywood trap of voodoo dolls and black magic as a representation and did some reading.  Thank you for bringing it to my attention that I was being small minded.", "Canada is not California.\n\nIn the US, both parents have separate rights and the other parent cannot interfere. Religious instruction is generally one of those rights.\n\nOP has no legal standing to prevent her ex from getting the kids baptized in nearly all American states.\n\nThe only thing the ex did wrong was doing it on OPs day. But it appears she consented to that.... So there is likely no cause of action here.\n\nNot legal advice. Not a lawyer, don't play one on TV. I just know a shit ton about custody orders.", "Sorry but legally nothing you can do as he\u2019s the parent as well. I\u2019d honestly say take it back to the court and see what they say.", "Short for latinoamerica. And I'm going with NTA, because the very least you deserve is an explanation. Ask your kids, chances are they got one on at least who the godparents are (my bet is extended family you haven't met), if they've seen them before and if they'll see them again.", "According to Catholic doctrine, anyone -- including a non-Christian -- can validly baptize if done with the right formula and intent to baptize. It's illicit -- you're not supposed to under ordinary circumstances and can be punished for it -- but that doesn't make it invalid.", "Get the baptism certificate. Report it to the bishop of your local Diocese. The Catholic Church has a vested interest in not having this type of baptism, and anyone who facilitated it by misrepresenting your position is subject to excommunication.", "It doesn't sound real to me, just symbolic.", "I like your openness and illness to learn. I'll upvote your first comment due to this", "You should have sat down and talked to your kids if they were old enough to understand. \n\nAlso, the size of his house has absolutely no bearing on anything. It\u2019s obvious you really dislike this man, but keep it to relevant facts.", "Yeah his mother is from Oaxaca, dad is from Ixtapa . Godparents are extended family friends that are probably decently familiar with the kids but I guess some commenters feel I do have a right if it\u2019s an actual catholic ceremony to choose but also me being non religious I don\u2019t really have a say in what he chooses tondo but when it\u2019s on my day with the kids that\u2019s when it is an issue I had the right to say no . But I didn\u2019t . Maybe next time I should just put my foot down .", "That's awful!!", "You absolutely did have a right, and I think it's very kind you allowed it. As far as I know, the church can't baptize children if their parents don't explicitly agree, which is why I said this situation flies right over inappropriate and square into fantastically weird. \n\nThere're a lot of people here who aren't actually religious but follow religious traditions, so beware of the first communion", "You absolutely had a right, and dude should be sending you flowers for not stopping the whole thing there and then. As a matter of fact, I had no idea that you could baptize children as catholic without both parents actively agreeing, even if one of them isn't religious. I have an inkling you can't, actually, and your ex stretched the truth to skip you over. As I said, NTA, and you were very kind to him and his family for allowing it. Beware of the first communion, because that's the next stop in Catholic religious tradition.", "Thankyou for understanding. And yes I try my best to be kind . Always."]}
