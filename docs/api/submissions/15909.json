It sounds like your partner is loving and supportive and you are conflicted about leaving when you've just got to where you want to be.  It might be time to sit down with your partner and figure out what you want your future to look like.

Also, did you and your partner look into the differences in cost of living between where you are now and the new city? Things can be quite expensive in the NYC tristate area and there\u2019s a chance that this $15k raise would really only just offset the rise in expenses.", "NAH but you have to consider telling your boyfriend you support him in taking this position that's good for him, but he'll have to move without you. It's not really fair to either of you to force each other to give up a good paying job.", "NAH\n\nA similar situation happened to my partner and me about 12 years ago.\n\nI'd been in a job I loved for about 7 years. I completed a post-grad qualification and received an internal promotion & pay rise as a result.\n\nMy partner was on a training scheme related to his PhD. When the scheme ended he was supposed to be taken on as a permanent member of staff. Unfortunately, NHS funding being what it is they told him with about 6 months to go that they had no money to keep him on.\n\nThis bombshell came a few months after my promotion. Fortunately, he managed to find a new job very quickly. Unfortunately it was 200 miles away. \n\nAfter a bit of soul searching we agreed that he would move without me and that if, after 3 months, he was happy in his job I would give my notice. If he wasn't happy he could come back and I would support him until he found something else.\n\nI ended up moving to join him after 6 months. I won't lie. It was hard leaving all our friends and a job I loved but ultimately it (he!) was worth it. We have built a great life here.\n\nPerhaps you could try a similar process? This would allow you to get some useful experience in your new job before you move. Alternatively, if he decides the new role/city isn't right for him he has something to come back to.\n\nGood luck whatever you decide to do.", "NAH, at least not yet, but this is something you two are going to have to have long and difficult conversations about and figure out what's the best way forward for you both.\n\nThere's no right answer, every possible outcome will require a sacrifice from one or both of you; this sort of thing is firmly on the tougher side of being in a relationship. Just try to come at this from a place of logic and mutual kindness and empathy, and be open to fully learning and working through one another's feelings.\n\nBest of luck to you both!", "NAH time to wip out the ol' pros and cons list and have an adult conversation. \n\nOr get petty, don't communicate and break up.

Low enough that him going from $45k to $60k would actually result in more money?", "NTA. You've worked very hard for this job for a long time. It's understandable that you don't want to give it up.", "NAH - have you looked into positions similar to what you do now in the new city?  If you're an hour from NYC, there will certainly be shelters and other places that can use help.  The experience you're getting now will help open doors, and I bet the management at your current place could help you with contacts if you decide to move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What is the cost of living difference? Cause if he is gaining $15K and your are losing it, that is a wash. If the cost of living is substantially higher, then you guys will actually be losing money on this move. \n\nPlus are you guaranteed to land a job in your field? What if it takes a few months, can your partner pay all expenses on his own?\n\nYou guys need to do research and have some real conversations before doing anything.", "So he gets $15K more but you lose $15K so what's the purpose of this? If it's hour drive from NYC it's probably more expensive too. Are you going to just drop your Masters? \n\nLose-lose to me.", "NAH.  You guys have conflicting opportunities and the destiny to make $90K a year as a couple regardless of which option you two ultimately select.  Neither of you are acting like pushy jerks about it, and you seem to both care about your partner's happiness in making this decision.\n\nIt'd be a good idea to look at the cost of living and quality of life you'd have in hypothetical city b vs where you are now and see if that makes this choice a little more obvious.  Since switching schools would probably be painful at this juncture the fact that his accepting would probably involve some element of living apart (unless you're fully online) that should be considered also.", ">My plan was to stay here while I finish out my master\u2019s degree (one more semester)\n\nI'm also concerned about this. OP, is your boyfriend expecting you to quit your job \\*and\\* drop out of your master's program? That's not a reasonable request at all. Finish your education, keep your job while you do, then reassess whether you want to move to be with him. \n\n(My wife and I had to spend a semester living in different states due to similar circumstances while I was in grad school, but we managed long distance so we could each still do what was best for our education and career.)", "NTA especially since you are one semester away from finish your master\u2019s degree.

Nevermind the fact that you will likely be losing 15K from your compensation (and taxed at a lower marginal rate I'm guessing, so in total you two will be losing out on more take home amount). This is on top of losing your professional advancement, and likely higher cost of living. New York is great, but I personally wouldn't make that move.", "NAH, but if you have doubts, you need to say sooner than later, so he doesn't get it set in his mind/excited about it more than he already is. \n\nIt sounds like your combined income stays the same and you would have to have the stress of losing your new job, and have to move, to a place that is likely more expensive to live in than wherever you are now. (I've heard NYC is expensive as hell to live in)", "Emmm.... long distance? Seriously, why does it always have to be either or? Either one person loses their job, or they break up. Why?

I think on balance NAH but bordering on N T A because your partner might be a bit TA if this is meant to be a super committed marriage-like relationship for not immediately declining the job himself. I know if I were in his position I'd be saying to my wife like \"my boss offered me this raise so obviously I told them we can't move in the near future because of your new job so I'd have to decline\". But that really depends on what your expectations are of your relationship at this point.", "NAH\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here \n\nCan you manage a long distance relationship for a year or so, geo-batching it for a while and getting together when you can?", "You need to look up how far 60k goes in New York state.
