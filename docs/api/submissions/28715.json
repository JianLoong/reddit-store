Some from foster care and some through an agency as infants. I'm one of the infant adoptees. My birth mother did not want to have children and found out later in the pregnancy so she was unable to terminate me like she wanted. She left me a letter stating this to me. And I think the only reason she did is my parents were always big on being honest and leaving communication open for our birth parents and she wanted to close it with me for good. My parents were upset that I read that letter at 12. My birth mother was... harsh in it.\n\nAnyway, my parents have always been involved in the community for adoptees. They felt it was good for us to be around others so it was normalized and so we could (hopefully) have friends who would understand.\n\nI was never the most comfortable around the group and I never understood why until recently.\n\nSo now that I'm a teenager I get to do the mature kid group where we can go without parents and siblings. I always knew adoptees have different perspectives and ideas on how things should be regarding adoption. My siblings and I all feel very similarly but from the group alone I knew it was not the same for everyone.\n\nThe older group I now sit in on is... a lot, and honestly I have very different views from everyone in it.\n\nThey all believe open adoption should be mandatory and birth parents should be obligated to meet with the children they surrender. They all say they have two moms/two dads or whatever combo when their adoptive parents are added into. I only have two parents. There have been some heated debates over my saying that. Some of them don't believe adoption should be a thing at all and we should find a way for kids to retain their original birth certificate and have adoptive parents essentially be caregivers without the legal parent title. I agree that it would be right for some. But I do not want the woman who gave me up to be the only mother I could ever have. I love my parents. I'm glad my birth certificate that I use shows them and not someone else I don't know. I'm also glad I don't have to meet the woman who gave birth to me. I have zero interest.\n\nThe whole thing has been stressful and I told my parents and told them I no longer want to go, and that includes the overall group. My siblings were all in support of that and so were my parents. They actually all decided to stop going.\n\nSome other members of the group (parents and adoptees) were annoyed that we stopped going and when they asked why I told them. They said I shouldn't walk away from people who understand me and I need a support network of adoptees. My parents cut their connection to me but I know they think I'm all kinds of shitty for pulling out of the group.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697038921, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175h4y9/aita_for_no_longer_wanting_to_attend_a_group_for/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don\u2019t *understand* you at all. They\u2019re using blanket statements to justify behavior in a situation you cannot relate to at all. The only thing you have in common with them is being adopted. \n\nThe terms and circumstances in your situation are realistically harsh and for them to marginalize your feelings is terribly self righteous of a group to do. How they don\u2019t understand that many who give up their children for adoption do so without ever wanting to meet them is baffling.", "NTA. You don't need to subject yourself to this kind of pressure just because of some supposedly shared experience which, as you've explained, really isn't all that shared or agreed upon.", "NTA. It's a support group. If you're not finding it supportive, it makes no sense to continue attending.\n\nIf you decide you want support related to your adoption sometime in the future, you can go back or, better yet, find a new group.", "NTA - its funny they say you should attend a group full of people who 'understand you' when clearly they don't.", "NTA. Mother and Father are verbs as much as they are titles.  Your parents were parents in every way that mattered to make the person you are today.  \n\n>They said I shouldn't walk away from people who understand me \n\nFrom their statements, they have no understanding or willingness to understand your perspective and your experience.  It seems like they are focused on proving your feelings wrong to make their feelings 'right'.  \n\n>and I need a support network of adoptees\n\nThey need a support network of adoptees who agree with them and you were in the way of that. If you, your parents, or any of your siblings are still having issues then it might be beneficial to look into individual therapy.", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThe purpose of this sort of group is to find support and understanding.  It sounds like this group is giving you neither of these things, so there is no reason to go.\n\nThere are as many attitudes as there are circumstances, regarding the adoptee's rights vs. the parent's rights.  I would say that the bottom line is that if the birth mother doesn't have a chance to remain anonymous, in some cases they would choose to terminate.  So \"adoptee rights\" could lead to those adoptees never being born.", "Definitely NTA, you got what you needed from these meetings/therapy and you are beyond that. You made it clear you love the parents who have adopted you, they are your parents. Everybody has a different path of healing, nothing is linear. I'm happy you have a family who loves you!", "NTA\n\nI did not find your age mentioned... but you sound quite mature and knowing what you feel and want.\n\nI was adopted as a baby  (Germany) . Adoptions were done anonymously then . The mother might leave a letter with the adoption office of the city but if the child never asks about it it will never be handed over.\n\nMy parents told me about it when I was maybe 8 or 9 . I never felt abandoned by my birth mother. I understood why she felt she could  not  keep me. Instead I felt special that my parents \"selected\" me above the other potential adoptees. \n\nI never contacted this office. I never ever felt the urge to try and find my birth mother. She gave me up - her loss, not mine. I had the \"bestest\" family ever, with a brother born kind of miraculously  5 years after me. \n\nWe were family. My adoption never played a role in my life. And I was always surprised and hurt when a \"friend\" of Mom's mentioned it whenever we met.  Thankfully, due to living quite far away, it was only every other year. I still wonder why she never got over the fact.\n\nLater in life I thought about having children myself and if I would adopt, too, if I could not conceive myself. I might have adopted but only a baby and never done an \"open adoption\" as they are called in Germany. I guess I am selfish enough to want to be the only Mom in my child's  life. \n\nIn short: Yes, you are adopted. But this NOT a trauma you have to live through again and [again. It](https://again.It) is just a fact like being born by a C-section - it has nothing to do with your everyday life. Move on.", "JFC. Of COURSE you can walk away. You do not like these people, or at least the views they're expressing. (It's interesting to me that these folks think they should express edicts regarding every single adoption on the planet. Don't they understand that these are very personal choices for all the people involved?) It is in no way your responsibility to keep hanging out with people you don't seem to like, and whose ideas you strongly disagree with. You seem like a really cool person. Find your own crowd, and best of luck. NTA. And also, I'm very, very sorry your bio parent wrote you that letter. It was incredibly unkind, and unfair, of her.", "NTA. Fellow adopted at birth person here, with adopted siblings to boot, the concept of this adoptee group is fucking WEIRD to me. Like I never felt \"misundersood\" by friends because I was adopted, maybe it is something beneficial for kids adopted later or coming from foster care? I'm a lot like you I have no interest in my birth parents (apparently they're cops? Gross.) And anyone advocating removing my parents from my birth certificate would get an earful.", "NTA. Sounds like you and your parents are in agreement that this group no longer serves you or makes you happy. You are not obligated to continue relationships forever with people you don't like. You do not have to care what these people may think about you. As you've seen, people often get to choose family and these other adoptees are not people you want to be in yours so cut them out and don't feel bad about it.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation for the group, it's meant to be a place to help people through what they're struggling with re: adoption. Everyone's story is different and the issue it seems like this group isn't validating your story as legitimate. Since your adoption experience looks different from theirs they aren't hearing you. There's no reason to keep going to a support group that doesn't support you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He knows all the info and where all the documents are and I leave it up to him.", "NTA-You have a support network of adoptees. They are your family. You don\u2019t need to subject yourself to people who clearly cannot and don\u2019t want to understand you. You have people who understand you, your family.", "NTA for certificates and the view in parentage it depends on case Basis imo,it is severe what you experienced,extremely so.\n\nWell that is more or less beside the actual point though you don't feel comfortable in that group and that is the important thing,thankfully your family has your back,so don't let someone you barely know dictate what you have to do", "NTA\n\nI am an adoptee, also as an infant.\n\nMy parents took me to some kind of support seminar group thing when I was about 12 or 13. It was so awkward. It really felt to me that some of the children in that group of adoptees had lives that were so focused on the fact that they were adopted that it was a HUGE part of their identity.\n\nI still remember a boy in the group, I believe his adoptive parents were the leaders of the seminar, talking about how he never in his life felt the same as any other child because he was adopted. I was gobsmacked at that! I never went back to that group either, it wasn't for me.\n\nBeing adopted is part of my identity, but not really much of it. I have been friends with people for years and they have never known I was adopted because it just never came up.", "NTA. You are a teenager and social group has a right  to demand you spend time with them if you don't want to. Particularly if you find yourself and your values at odds with them. Frankly this group sounds like it is bordering on being  cultish. Your parents may have some right to be disappointed that you chose to leave but to think you are \"all kinds of shitty\" for pulling out of the group is just wrong. Stick to your guns, and if your folks give you shit for your decision, give it right back to them (politely--but very firmly.)", "NTA.  I've been part of a \"support community\" before that I had to distance myself from because people in that group make it their whole identity, while to me it's just part of who I am.

Imagine how awful it would be for a kid desperate to meet their birth parent and it's enforced so they know it will happen, but said birth parent treats them like shit?", "It really isn't. I think adoption is one of those experiences that is completely individual. Adoptees within the same family can disagree on adoption. We don't share a hive mind or anything like that. And sometimes it's really aggravating when people speak like we are.\n\nI especially hate the implication that I must be excited to turn 18 and \"meet my real mom\" because I have, I live with my real mom, I have been raised by my real mom.", "Thanks. I'm happy I have my family too. My parents are amazing and my siblings are great even when they annoy me lol.", "I agree it largely depends on that and I think just overall personal view. My siblings would all say they have two parents, our mom and dad, and even the ones who know their birth parents wouldn't really consider them their parents. But I know others in the same circumstances would absolutely consider them all parents. Really just shows it's not the same for everyone.", "That's how I feel. My parents never made us feel othered by being adopted and I was the same as other kids. We were all just kids and a family. Being adopted came up for sure, but I never felt different from others. Even seeing my siblings have contact with their bio relatives never made me feel different from others generally.", "My parents support me and even left the group with me. It was other adoptive parents and other adoptees in the group who have been giving me/us shit. My parents shut their contact with me down.", "Yes! Like I fully support people feeling a different way and would never say anyone is wrong for their feelings on their adoption journey. But it's not all that I am. Never has been.", "No, but sometimes people paid for food for everyone to eat.", "They\u2019re looking at it from the rights of the child, not the situation or even the perspective of the person who gave them up for adoption in the first place. They want to somehow make things unfold in a way that puts more responsibility back on the birth parent, but that negates the entire reason of why many choose closed adoptions\u2026some people are set in one mindset, and one mindset only.", "Well there goes my theory about why they were so resistant to you leaving. I guess they just took it very personally."]}
