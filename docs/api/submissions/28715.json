I agree that it would be right for some. But I do not want the woman who gave me up to be the only mother I could ever have. I love my parents. I'm glad my birth certificate that I use shows them and not someone else I don't know. I'm also glad I don't have to meet the woman who gave birth to me.

It was supposed to be a completely closed adoption but she was able to get a concession for a letter a year.\n\nAfter he turned 18, her final letter had all of her contact info and her real name, everything about his extended bio family if he was interested in making contact.\n\nHe wasn't. She's unhappy, but she says *frequently* that she takes it as a sign that he has the family he needs, and she never wanted him to feel *obligated* to reach out. What would be worse than this silence, to her, would be some kind of forced relationship.", "But the group doesn\u2019t care about you they care about pushing their agenda and opinions on you. Bonus points if group is able to convert you to their agenda. Leave with peace and take a break.\n Three of my children were adopted, foreign, awful conditions. We have pictures and notes from bio mom but notes aren\u2019t comforting.  I explained it as some people aren\u2019t wired in their brains to be parents and they either were smart enough to give up the children or someone else was protecting the child. That doesn\u2019t make the bio parents bad people it just makes for not great parents. Lucky for you ( and your parents) good parents were found for you. We did find some adoptees who have opinions like our children and those are ones my children talk to about adoption. People from the group you attended don\u2019t see or understand that not all bio parents are wonderful people, unfortunately the group is too small minded to listen to your opinions.  You\u2019ll find people like you probably in weirdest way but you are not alone.\nYou are in a great family, they are lucky to have you, be proud of who you are inside and out. Just don\u2019t let the group bore into your brain and make you doubt yourself. All families are different that\u2019s our family motto. Your family is different, special and perfect .", "I think the key perspective here is that you've known since you were 12 that your bio-mom isn't someone that you wish to have in your life. She was very clear that she didn't want a relationship with you ever, and her choice of words let you know that she wasn't the kind of person you want in your life. You have a closure that many adoptees your age don't have.\n\nI think some of your peers might be stuck on ideas that their bio-parents were too young to take care of them, or too poor, or too ill. That their adoption was about inability rather than outright rejection. And so they haven't thought through the ramifications of trying to build a relationship with someone who isn't interested. You can't force someone to like you, much less love you, and trying to do so isn't healthy and won't lead to happiness. And some people never learn that lesson, adopted or not.", "NTA OP. My best friend is an adoptee. Her parents were super honest about it. Her support group was her friends. In fact, ive been her support through everything. You can build a village. Their situation is not yours. And thats ok.", "If it's about the adoptee, why don't your feelings matter?", "Or the other side: my sibs-in-law chose to do a closed adoption because the open ones had requirements like \u201cyou have to participate in joint Christmas and Halloween parties.\u201d They\u2019re Orthodox Jews. Three guesses as to why this was unacceptable. \n\nI\u2019d honestly say anyone wanting mandated Open adoptions is ethnocentric to the extreme, as the current setup is not designed to work with minority cultures or faiths. Are they going to enforce the bios only going to appropriate kosher or Halal places? How about dressing appropriately for the child\u2019s culture when visiting? Will they arrange holiday visits appropriate for (and catered in accordance with) the child\u2019s culture and beliefs?\n\nBecause right now they assume a typical American family. When the adoptive family is from a different culture, they can\u2019t do open simply because the current versions are so hostile to minority cultures.", "This support group is honestly doing a terrible job! It should have anticipated the various backgrounds and opinions on adoption. Is there a therapist mediating these meetings, or is it just a sort of \"youth group\"?", "I can\u2019t imagine how naive a lot of these kids are? It\u2019s so heartbreaking that you had to be exposed to the realities that can exist in such a harsh way at such a young age, but you\u2019re right that the people who love you are the ones who matter. I hate that these kids, best case scenario, would meet their bio parent(s) and then have to deal with the devastation of knowing someone who wanted them COULD NOT keep them because of circumstances. It also breaks my heart that these kids\u2019 families are essentially hearing them say \u201cyou\u2019re not my real family/ you don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nAdoption IS such an individual experience with such varied traumas people can or can not have that to say a single foster/ adoptee would or should have the same experience or outlook as any other is wild to me.\n\nGood luck to you, and I hope you can be proud of yourself for having your own back and (likely) the backs of your younger siblings who could have been exposed to this toxic mindset that an adopted family isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d and that their bio parent will be out there waiting for them and that any reunification would magically be whatever they want it to be vs emotionally complex and a potentially traumatic let down.", "If your biological family sucks then you build your logical family. One of the better things about getting older is getting more power to choose who you want in your life. That group seems dogmatic and into groupthink. If there\u2019s no room for your experience then there\u2019s no good reason to keep them in your life.", "You are a wise one.  I am so happy that you have such a wonderful family.  Set this works n fire, kiddo!", "My apologies for misreading your post and assuming your parents did not support your decision. Good for them.", "The terrible thing is in the US more and more women will be forced to give birth and have the weight over their head that a child may come looking for them(if they choose adoption).  \n\nBecause the rights of the (parasitic) fetus outweigh the rights of an autonomous female and then after she's forced to give birth to an independent being(baby), she's required to raise it OR give it up for adoption.  But if these cult adoptees have their way, she'll never have her autonomy back.  \n\nFirst she's merely an incubator and then she's the Mommy whether or not she wanted to be one.", "Some of the mothers may have been traumatized and chose to give birth to the result instead of the other option. They do not want to relive the trauma by seeing the kid again. No consideration of the parent at all. I get adoptees wanting to know where they come from, but they should understand that not all birth parents want to see the child. That is why there are closed adoptions.", "You bring up a good point about how sometimes in adoptions the reverse happens. Sometimes the adoptees choose to stay anonymous so it\u2019s a difficult road either way.", "*world, not works"]}
