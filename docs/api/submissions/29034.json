In the past, he's made a lot of comments about my body and insecurities that worsened my body image and eating disorder at the time. For example, he'd call me a Halloween skeleton when I had anorexia and a prostitute when I wore patterned stockings. In the beginning, I'd just take it and even try to go with his comments at the time (run an extra lap, cover up, etc.) But overtime, I grew tired of it and would insult him back (call him out for his baldness, hygeine). It's not great, but it's the only way to get him to stop most times. He has this type of insulting, where he relentlessly makes fun of you and does not stop till you give him a strong reaction. Ignoring him usually makes him follow you and get other family members to join him. \nRecently, I came to visit him and my mom and he saw that I was wearing these leggings (gymshark amplify leggings in pink for reference). This was hilarious for him because he though the outline part below my butt looked like underwear. Usually I'd just brush it off, but I felt very uncomfortable that my dad was pointing and commenting on my butt and told him \"that makes me really uncomfortable that you're making fun of my butt- can you stop?\" My mistake because he continued to laugh hysterically and it came to the point where he lifted my hoodie from behind to further point at my butt. The relentless berating was back.\nI snapped at that point and called him \"disgusting, old man\" and went on about how this was why my brother in here highschool was getting in trouble for touching girls inappropriately and saying rude, inappropriate things about their body - through my dad's influence (which is all true, he gets in trouble regularly because of those reasons). The comment seemed to get to him and he immediately got offended saying, \"You can't call me that, I'm your father... It's different when I do it to you - I'm allowed to do it because I'm your father. Family members are allowed to joke around with one another like that.\" My mom later said it was not right, but never denied him when she was sitting right there when everything happened. I don't regret standing up for myself, but am wondering if AITA  and went too far for calling him a \"disgusting, old man\"?

Point out to him it's WORSE for a father to do that to their own damn kid that another woman, way way worse. being a father doesn't give you the right to harass your kid, talk about them sexually, talk about their butt or generally abuse them verbally. \n\nHis behaviour is turning his son into the kind of kid who touches people inappropriately. he's learned that from him, in his own home, he's turning his son into a predator and when that eventually causes real trouble he'll always have to remember he and his disgusting behaviour is the reason his son got in trouble. Or he could grow up, be a man and stop treating ALL women like this and teaching his son the same thing before it's too late.", "NTA\nLook at the role modelling he\u2019s done for your brother.. clearly he\u2019s a dirty old man.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, you even have an eating disorder and he cannot help himself. It is good you stand up for yourself, and you should continue to do so. \nYou dad sucks. I am sorry you have such a sucky dad. He sounds like a bully, who bullies you because you are his child and in the seemingly \"weaker\" position.", "NAH.  his position as father gives him a higher responsibility to respect you and role model proper behavior to build you up and show your brother what proper behavior is.  Instead he's reinforcing a double standard that's having a negative effect on you both", "Yes, you are.\n\nStanding up for yourself and clapping back is fine, it's probably what he wanted as he has been trying toughen you up the only way he has ever known.\n\nImplying gross sexual imposition where it doesn't exist, especially from your father, is so far over the line I wouldn't blame him if you were completely cut off and unwelcome going forward.\n\nGrow up and apologize or continue on your spiral of self pity and 'empowered' self destruction.\n\nIt may sound overly dramatic but the pattern is clear and undeniable once you've seen it enough, which you aren't old enough to have done.\n\nMock it or take it, but don't say you were never told.", "Thank you for your thoughtful reply. I've sat down with my mom a couple times in the past, but she usually gives in to his decision.

Would honestly appreciate advice if you have any. Most of the time, he does the opposite of what people tell him to do and I'm afraid to trigger an adverse reaction. I think the going around and making fun of and harassing girls is b/c my dad + it's the popular thing in his highschool friend group now (who watch Andrew Tate and misogynist podcasts)", "7 days.", "Thats really good to know. \n\nGoing no contact with family is always valid if they are detrimental to your mental health (I did it to my bigoted family so my kids wouldn't experience the harm I did growing up) so make sure to place your own wellbeing above that of anyone else.\n\nSending virtual fist bumps \ud83d\udc4a to keep on smiling", "In terms of your brother, I'd suggest that you give him advance notice: that you let him know that you want to have a serious conversation about your relationship and concerns that you have. \n\nI'd advise that you meet him at a neutral place - not at his home where your Mom and Dad might be hanging around. Maybe take him out for a coffee or something. \n\nI'd then share with him about how your Dad's behaviour has made you feel and the effect that it has had on you. I would hope the penny would drop from that and that alone - but you may want to encourage him that he has the potential to be whatever he chooses to be. And, more particularly, he has the potential to do and be better. \n\nI would hope that a direct, reasonable, grown up conversation would have an effect. If not, you may need to set really clear boundaries as to what you are and are not willing to accept. Alongside that you should describe consequences - and, if you do go this route, you need to hold your nerve and do what you said you would do. \n\nFundamentally, you are in the right. Their behaviour is so far from acceptable and you should not have to put up with it again. The good news is, now you are an adult, you have your own place, your own support network, and so you don't have to tolerate this any more.", "Thank you for insight- I didn't even consider kids yet but that is a valid point I should start thinking about. I'm glad you've prioritized your kids and own wellbeing. I honestly couldn't imagine having kids around my parents with the way they are now \n\n\ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude01"]}
