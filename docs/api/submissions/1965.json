{"id": 1965, "submission_id": "yrh2hq", "title": "AITA for calling her unbearable?", "selftext": "My wife has sensory issues. She's never been to a doctor for these issues so it's truly self diagnosed. She thinks that since she hates loud noises and doesn't like being looked at that she has sensory issues. Not trying to discredit her or anything but it's over the top some days. Like if two people are talking at once she gets super overwhelmed and irritated. Or as mentioned above, if anyone or any **thing** is looking at her, she gets self conscious and pissed off. \n\nOn to the real issue. I got a dog about a year ago. Her name is Lola and she is a Corgi. She's very energetic and needy but training is going well. My wife has a cat, whom we have had for like 4 years I believe. She has always had a problem with my dog. Reason being is the fact that my dog is needy. She loves being touched. She wants to follow us everywhere. She whines when she wants attention She will sleep on any article of clothing we have on the floor that has our scent before sleeping on her dog bed/kennel. She is constantly sniffing the air/floor whenever we are eating and often sniffs the trash can or litter box. But my wife has an issue with most of these behaviors. Mostly the whining but due to the resentment she has gotten from the whining, she takes issue with the dog sleeping on our clothing or even sniffing around whenever we have food. It irritates her to no end. So like whenever the dog starts walking around sniffing us when eating, my wife uses an irritated tone to tell her to get out of the room. Or whenever my wife sees her sleeping on our clothing, she immediately takes the clothes away and says she is \"fucking sick\" of constantly having dog hair on her clothing. I could almost understand if she didn't get as pissed as she does. \n\nOn to the big problem.. yesterday we ate dinner in our bedroom while watching a movie. As soon as Lola saw we had food she came out of her kennel and started sniffing the air and dead pan staring at us while we ate and whined a few times. My wife starts fidgeting but doesn't say anything. Lola starts inching closer to us while staring at my wife because my wife was closest. My wife looks at me and says \"you want to speak to her? Since you get pissed whenever I do.\" I told her to just ignore her and act like she isn't there. So my wife just gets up with her plate and says \"I don't fucking want a dog staring at me while I'm eating! I don't even like it when people stare at me so why should I change how I feel or fake it till I make it to accommodate to your dog?\" I told her she was being fucking unbearable. She takes off and doesn't come home. I'm being told I'm an AH for disrespecting my wife's feelings. AITA?\n\nETA: I don't want this pushed solely off in my favor here so there are a few things I want to point out. I want legit judgement, not biased. My wife wants to get in to therapy but we are trying to save for a house so it's my fault that she hasn't gotten it. I have mentioned a few times whenever she suggests it that we are trying to save for a house so that is my fault that she hasn't yet been to therapy. She will get her therapy eventually however. As for the clothing on the floor issue.. my wife is very tidy. None of her clothing are ever originally on the floor but mine are. Lola does reach up and take my wife's clothing off of the hooks in the closet and makes nests out of them. We do not have a closet door.", "created_utc": 1668091421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrh2hq/aita_for_calling_her_unbearable/", "score": 434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's never been to a doctor for these issues so it's truly self diagnosed. She thinks that since she hates loud noises and doesn't like being looked at that she has sensory issues. Not trying to discredit her or anything but it's over the top some days. Like if two people are talking at once she gets super overwhelmed and irritated. Or as mentioned above, if anyone or any **thing** is looking at her, she gets self conscious and pissed off. \n\nOn to the real issue. I got a dog about a year ago. Her name is Lola and she is a Corgi. She's very energetic and needy but training is going well. My wife has a cat, whom we have had for like 4 years I believe. She has always had a problem with my dog. Reason being is the fact that my dog is needy. She loves being touched. She wants to follow us everywhere. She whines when she wants attention She will sleep on any article of clothing we have on the floor that has our scent before sleeping on her dog bed/kennel. She is constantly sniffing the air/floor whenever we are eating and often sniffs the trash can or litter box. But my wife has an issue with most of these behaviors. Mostly the whining but due to the resentment she has gotten from the whining, she takes issue with the dog sleeping on our clothing or even sniffing around whenever we have food. It irritates her to no end. So like whenever the dog starts walking around sniffing us when eating, my wife uses an irritated tone to tell her to get out of the room. Or whenever my wife sees her sleeping on our clothing, she immediately takes the clothes away and says she is \"fucking sick\" of constantly having dog hair on her clothing. I could almost understand if she didn't get as pissed as she does. \n\nOn to the big problem.. yesterday we ate dinner in our bedroom while watching a movie. As soon as Lola saw we had food she came out of her kennel and started sniffing the air and dead pan staring at us while we ate and whined a few times. My wife starts fidgeting but doesn't say anything. Lola starts inching closer to us while staring at my wife because my wife was closest. My wife looks at me and says \"you want to speak to her? Since you get pissed whenever I do.\" I told her to just ignore her and act like she isn't there. So my wife just gets up with her plate and says \"I don't fucking want a dog staring at me while I'm eating! I don't even like it when people stare at me so why should I change how I feel or fake it till I make it to accommodate to your dog?\" I told her she was being fucking unbearable. She takes off and doesn't come home. I'm being told I'm an AH for disrespecting my wife's feelings. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Currently you aren\u2019t doing this with a dog and you need to.", "So basically your poor wife is training a dog and a grown ass man who isn\u2019t capable of training a dog or even picking up laundry off the floor??? Tell your wife if she wants out of the dumpster fire of marriage she\u2019s in I\u2019d donate to her go fund me.", "Probably a few cute little \"tricks.\"", "Ah. Yeah, that would be really annoying to me too. Can you close the closet door? Or train Lola to *not* do that?", "Is she making full on, getting ready for puppies nest or just pulling the clothes down and laying on them? But either way, YTA because you don\u2019t care that the dog is purposely pulling down her clothes that she keeps put away because it doesn\u2019t bother you. \n\nI told my partner if he wanted a dog, 100% him. If that dog pulled down my clean clothes and nested in them, there would be hell to pay because I already said I wasn\u2019t taking any active role besides walks and dinner. And I\u2019m not re washing clothes caked in fur either because how could they get covered if I put them away?\n\n Train the dog. And get your wife the help she deserves instead of torturing her with the dog and then \u201csurprise pikachu face\u201d when you don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t properly deal with her emotions.", "Get a child gate or closet door, that would be annoying to me if my dog started pulling my clean clothes out of my closet to sleep on them. Also, your wife wants therapy, get it for her. Also kennel your dog when you eat", "Oh that makes it SO much worse. The fact that you are saying this and not realizing how much of TA you are is... YTA", "I hope your soon to be ex wife never comes back. You're a bad husband who puts his selfishness and laziness above her peace. It's disgusting.", "So she's biting clothes and yanking on them until they fall? Then lays and rolls on them?  So the clothes being ripped, stretched out, slobbered on, wrinkled, and covered with hair and dog smell is just.... Okay to you?  I'd be livid.", "Agreed. A dog will sit inches away and sniff as close to your plate as possible and beg if you don\u2019t teach them. \n\nOur dog has a mat and knows the command \u201cgo to the mat\u201d. That\u2019s where he stays while we eat. I don\u2019t think we could get him not to look at us, but calmly lying down 15 feet away from us is a lot more comfortable than sitting two feet away begging.", "I\u2019m the same way, I\u2019ve trained my dogs with a no beg command and they actually have to practically go out of my view or room. I can\u2019t stand it. It\u2019s not that hard to curb this behavior and I don\u2019t get how Op just ignores it. Among many other things they ignore.", "He thinks she's unbearable to live with, but want to buy a house before like... Working on making her bearable?", "Dogs aren't cheap, either. He's ok with that expense but not with spending money on his wife's health.", "I second this. I have sensory processing disorder and am sensitive to sound on a good day. I have an ear infection now, and it was bad last night. I almost had a legit breakdown because my husband wanted to talk to me,  the fridge was making a weird sound, the dryer was running, and there's a non-stop whooshing noise in my ear. OP should be very grateful his wife has the self control to not snap at him.", "That\u2019s the exact one I\u2019m thinking of", "In that case that someone should say no right out.\n\nI'm not trying to defend op, he is clearly the asshole here.\n\nBut if you say \"Ok, but it's 100% you responsibility\" then that is a yes.", "It sounds to me like there are clothes laying around on the floor and the dog lays on them. That's typical dog behavior to be comforted by the scent of their owner(s).  And I've never seen a dog that won't beg with their eyes. Not all dogs are fully trained in a year either.\n\nI'm sure the cat also trips up the owners at times.  That's part of having a pet.", "And the real reason YTA comes out. You are putting you wanting to buy a house, which you aren\u2019t even ready to do, above mental health help that your wife needs now. You call her unbearable, but block her from getting help she wants, which seems to be floating into financial abuse on your part if you can unilaterally stop her from getting into therapy.", "Wow. You really are TA. You say she\u2019s undiagnosed implying that it\u2019s not legitimate but it\u2019s really because you\u2019re cheap and aren\u2019t willing to prioritize her health.", "YTA for this reason. Your wife\u2019s health is more important. She\u2019s not making it up - she\u2019s really struggling and you need to have empathy and compassion for her.", "If I was your wife id leave you for that statement alone. YTA", "Have you looked online for sliding scale services or free services?  If you have insurance, it might be covered through that as well.", "Ding ding ding ....here is the answer.  You say it yourself, it's on you.  Take her to therapy and take your dog to training", "\u201cSo that\u2019s on me\u201d he says as if this isn\u2019t straight-up abusive", "Imagine actively denying someone therapy and then calling them unbearable. Jesus YTA", "You\u2019re 100% the AH. Your responses have not given me any confidence. I\u2019m currently in this situation with my housemate where she doesn\u2019t look after a dog that\u2019s hers and none of my responsibility but yet she ruins my things so I have to tell her off. I\u2019ve had to throw things away because they were ruined by her dog. \n\nYou not training the dog that you so desperately wanted and who needs ridged structure and training and it falls onto your wife who doesn\u2019t even want the dog because if someone doesn\u2019t do it, it\u2019s going to bother her.\n\nAlso refusing your wife from medical care is legitimate abuse. It sounds like she really needs help and is asking for help but you\u2019re out right telling her no because you want to save for a house? If anyone I knew did that to me, I\u2019d outright cut them out of my life.", "So you bought a corgi, even though she probably didn't want one, but her legitimate need to get mental health is a luxury? YTA", "If you can't afford therapy for your wife (literally her health) but you can afford a dog you wanted, you are a complete piece of trash.\n\nAlso, how much are these 'sensory issues' or just her being pushed to the edge by being refused therapy by her husband, and having an untrained dog make a mess everywhere and stare at you while eating?", "Dude right now is the worst possible time to buy a house send your wife to therapy first, save for a house still but a smaller amount so your wife can get the therapy she needs\n\nEHS you for prioritizing a home purchase above your wife's mental health \nYour wife for redirecting her anger at the dog for doing dog things", "Hey OP, guess what? You're an AH, a terrible husband, and bad dog owner.", "Are you kidding??? You value a pile of brick and glass over your wife\u2019s mental health and wellness? You deserve all of her complains and then some, YTA majorly", "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f this is y ur an ah", "That doesn't make for a supportive husband that prioritizes his wife. Maybe she's sick of being second fiddle to everything you want.", "YTA. How incredibly selfish of you!", "This alone makes you TA. A raging, gaping chasm of an AH.", "YTA She should leave you. Then she won\u2019t have to deal with your annoying dog, or you, and she\u2019ll be able to get therapy!", "That\u2019s his own fault then and ridiculous. At least if she gets a diagnosis she can pursue management etc. prob be happier in general.", "He really has no right to complain then", "So next time YOUR dog trips her and she falls and breaks her coccyx, will it still be hilarious? Will you still prevent her from getting treatment? Will you still mock her for being hurt by your out of control dog?", "My goodness! The more you talk, the more I am solid on my answer. YTA.", "What happens when you land on the dog instead of your ass and you have a huge vet bill because Lola got hurt? What if your wife is seriously injured? Will that still be funny? Or will no one get proper medical attention because you\u2019re saving to buy a house?", "If the corgi is underfoot it\u2019s dangerous. Not funny. We get upset at people for not looking at where they\u2019re going, and if my cats know to not be underfoot, your dog should too.", "I\u2019d suggest working on training her sooner rather than later. They\u2019re incredibly smart but need training and structure. Corgis are known to be like this. Prob wasn\u2019t the best breed to get while living with someone who can\u2019t handle that. But I think with proper training you could at least get her to stop doing it to your wife.", "No. It\u2019s not funny, and when the dog is older, it\u2019s going to injure your dog too. \n\nStop being a shitty dog owner - it\u2019s hurts your dog, your wife, and you.\n\nYour relationship with your dog will be so much better if you maintain good training.\n\nYta", "Cancer and not being able to have a dog look at you are not even close. Talk about apples and oranges.", "What training lol. Op has said that the dog literally pulls out her clean clothes, and he doesn\u2019t care because it doesn\u2019t bother him and he doesn\u2019t care if his and her clothes get covered in fur. Hope his wife gives him a dose of reality.", "The dog has a crate. Why hasn't OP thought to crate the dog when they're eating?", "Honestly agree, but also depends on the agreement before getting the dog. If she didn\u2019t want it/made it clear that if they get it he has to train/be responsible for the dog then for sure he\u2019s the asshole. You dont get an animal inbred for generations to be needy and expect a person who hates attention to just put up with it.", "My sessions have always been right around 150$-300$ tops. A corgi is around 1500-2000 if you go to a reputable breeder. That\u2019s a minimum of 5 higher priced sessions for a cheaper priced corgi or a maximum of about 13 sessions for cheaper therapy and a higher priced corgi.", "My thoughts also. He's going to be giving half that money or house to his wife when she becomes his ex wife", "Yeah, he claims the training is going well, but the fact that she's still begging after a year proves that is a lie. Even the approach is wrong: \"pretending she's not there\" does nothing to discourage the unwanted behavior.", "Oh God I misread that part and thought it said she doesn't do that. I would be losing my shit.", "No wonder the wife is pissed. OP needs to train the dog he wanted so much not to make a complete mess everywhere!", "I would lose my shit if my dog was tearing my clothes off the hanger. My cat LOVES to sneak into the closet and tantrum about and would find holes in the bottom of my pant legs or maxi-dresses. Regrettably you can\u2019t train a cat so I had to put a lock on the closet so she couldn\u2019t fish it open with her paw anymore.", "Yeah. In that case he really needs to get the dog and himself trained. I do stand by that comment.", "I doubt she\u2019s yelling. Women have to strengthen/deepen their voices often when giving commands to dogs to make them more likely to listen. She\u2019s probably just doing that. Which is why Lola listens- she\u2019s commanding and consistent. Hubby is, in doggo\u2019s mind, a pushover.", "I admittedly have no issue with her sleeping on the clothes so I haven't tried correcting the behavior. The closest has no door. It's like a big entry way looking opening.", "My ex's dog was a contentious little shit about my rules. I have a picture of him after I told him to go inside because he was barking at people from the patio and he laid down with his front paws JUST over the threshold. And he knew I'd get onto him if I could touch him with my foot while eating so he'd sit at exactly the right distance to be able to lean away from me if I marked my boundary and then *leeeaaaan* forward when I put my leg down. He was a sassy boy. I miss him.", "Yeah my dogs even know to stay out of the kitchen while I'm preparing their food. I say OUT and they know where the imaginary line is. Of course they still try to be under my feet at first but as long as they listen when I tell them what to do I can't fault them for trying lol", "I understand that", "OP said the dog drags his wife's clothes out of a closet or rips them off the hangers to make nest to sleep on. \n\nAnd, all the years I spend raising cats,not one ever made me trip, so that I don't see as being part of a pet owner..", "\"She's self diagnosed\n\n... because I keep talking her out of going to see a professional where she might get a formal diagnosis.\"", "Yep - she can't even get fucking diagnosed most likely because OP won't let her get therapy and treatment she needs to start the process.", "Lola will get her vet visit. Wife won\u2019t get her hospital visit.", "It\u2019s just horrible how therapy isn\u2019t an option because they are saving up for a house, but buying a dog (of a more expensive breed, with the added vet and other costs is totally fine because that\u2019s what OP wanted. Shows where his priorities lie.", "Lol, imagine getting a divorce over not being able to have a dog sit and stare at you and sniffing the air while you eat. Talk about a first-world problem.", "Nono that\u2019s her sensory problems she\u2019s not allowed to get help for. Not a completely reasonable boundary or problem to have with an animal. I mean the dog doesn\u2019t steal HIS clean clothes cause he leaves dirty ones laying around for the dog to nest in so why does it bother her??? /s", "I\u2019ve trained my cats and they know the word no and I snap my fingers when they are on a surface they\u2019re not allowed on and they jump down. They can be trained but it\u2019s a bit harder than dogs. One of mine still sneaks onto the counter when we go to bed lol \ud83d\ude44", "Fully agree.", "So you're messy AND you aren't training your dog.  I don't blame your wife for leaving.", "Are you serious? She never wanted this dog, and you are basically encouraging the dog\u2019s bad behavior. The things she does would drive me crazy, and I don\u2019t have sensory issues. This is exceptionally inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, support her in getting therapy to help her cope with her sensory sensitivities rather than what YOU want (a house). It almost seems like you\u2019re trying to sabotage her with that and the dog.\n\nVery firmly YTA.", "So what are you training her to do besides maybe sit?", "Changing to YTA.. you *know* it bothers her to get dog hair all over her previously clean, hair-free and wrinkle-free clothes but you don\u2019t care so you just let the dog waltz into the closet and keep pulling the clothes down. What the fuck dude. How selfish is that?", "So you don\u2019t care that your wife has an issue with your dog\u2019s poor behavior just because it doesn\u2019t bother you. Do you even care about your wife or her feelings?", "dude YTA, you are failing your wife AND your dog. Dogs need training and boundaries to feel safe, that's why she's so needy she has 0 structure from you. Don't get a dog if you're not willing to put any effort into actually being a good dog owner. As for your wife you're actively preventing her accessing treatment that would change her life, a house can wait another year, hell who actually wants to buy in this climate anyway?", "Are you TRYING to make your wife hate your dog?\n\nYTA. And a bad dog owner.", "Can you afford a fucking Baby gate then? Do you care so little for your wife that it never occurred to you to attempt any kind of intervention to increase the wife's comfort? And what about Lola? Do you think Lola genuinely understands why one of the humans she lives with is always agitated and scolding her? She doesn't recognize the activity as forbidden or a transgression because her primary human does not teach her that it's a transgression. Lola probably exists in a constant state of anxiety trying to understand why the woman is upset with her! It would benefit her so much if you would train her to respect your wife's boundaries even a LITTLE, because the dogs home would not be constantly half filled with rising tension!! No wonder the poor girl whines and seeks reassurance constantly. She can sense the never ending undercurrent of negativity in the home and you can't be fucked to do anything to help your wife cope and thus calm the household. YTA man, to your wife AND your dog!", "train your dog and your wife won\u2019t resent you dude", "Dude you are such an AH and a bad dog owner too. Train your damn dog. A year into owning them and they pull things off hangers and shelves, whine and beg for food, and is seemingly just waiting for the right moment to get into the litter box. Train. Your. Dog. \n\nAnd stop blocking your wife from getting help.", "YTA", "Do you even care about your wife? Why did you get a dog knowing your wife would not be okay with these behaviors?", "Can you buy a baby gate for the closet so you did can\u2019t go in there?  I realize that you love your dog but you are doing both the dog and your wife a disservice by not training the dog and by discouraging your wife from getting therapy.  You must know that your wife\u2019s mental health issues are unbearable to her.  The house can wait.  YTA", "You do know you\u2019re a terrible dog owner, right? Why did you even get the dog if you weren\u2019t going to care for it properly.", "Do you care more about your dog than your wife? Because that\u2019s the impression I\u2019m getting here.", "Good god YTA. who cares if you don\u2019t mind. Your wife does. It\u2019s your dog. Train your damn dog.", "ok but SHE DOES and she also lives there. Are her needs and preferences not important?", "Why the fuck are your clothes on the floor?! Stop being a slob and pick up after yourself. It\u2019s clear your dog started this habit because you kept you clothes lying around. YTA for being a slob, not training your dog AND hindering your wife from getting the therapy she clearly needs because you have put your WANTS above her NEEDS.", "Why don\u2019t you care at all about what your wife wants?"]}
