{"id": 1965, "submission_id": "yrh2hq", "title": "AITA for calling her unbearable?", "selftext": "My wife has sensory issues. She's never been to a doctor for these issues so it's truly self diagnosed. She thinks that since she hates loud noises and doesn't like being looked at that she has sensory issues. Not trying to discredit her or anything but it's over the top some days. Like if two people are talking at once she gets super overwhelmed and irritated. Or as mentioned above, if anyone or any **thing** is looking at her, she gets self conscious and pissed off. \n\nOn to the real issue. I got a dog about a year ago. Her name is Lola and she is a Corgi. She's very energetic and needy but training is going well. My wife has a cat, whom we have had for like 4 years I believe. She has always had a problem with my dog. Reason being is the fact that my dog is needy. She loves being touched. She wants to follow us everywhere. She whines when she wants attention She will sleep on any article of clothing we have on the floor that has our scent before sleeping on her dog bed/kennel. She is constantly sniffing the air/floor whenever we are eating and often sniffs the trash can or litter box. But my wife has an issue with most of these behaviors. Mostly the whining but due to the resentment she has gotten from the whining, she takes issue with the dog sleeping on our clothing or even sniffing around whenever we have food. It irritates her to no end. So like whenever the dog starts walking around sniffing us when eating, my wife uses an irritated tone to tell her to get out of the room. Or whenever my wife sees her sleeping on our clothing, she immediately takes the clothes away and says she is \"fucking sick\" of constantly having dog hair on her clothing. I could almost understand if she didn't get as pissed as she does. \n\nOn to the big problem.. yesterday we ate dinner in our bedroom while watching a movie. As soon as Lola saw we had food she came out of her kennel and started sniffing the air and dead pan staring at us while we ate and whined a few times. My wife starts fidgeting but doesn't say anything. Lola starts inching closer to us while staring at my wife because my wife was closest. My wife looks at me and says \"you want to speak to her? Since you get pissed whenever I do.\" I told her to just ignore her and act like she isn't there. So my wife just gets up with her plate and says \"I don't fucking want a dog staring at me while I'm eating! I don't even like it when people stare at me so why should I change how I feel or fake it till I make it to accommodate to your dog?\" I told her she was being fucking unbearable. She takes off and doesn't come home. I'm being told I'm an AH for disrespecting my wife's feelings. AITA?\n\nETA: I don't want this pushed solely off in my favor here so there are a few things I want to point out. I want legit judgement, not biased. My wife wants to get in to therapy but we are trying to save for a house so it's my fault that she hasn't gotten it. I have mentioned a few times whenever she suggests it that we are trying to save for a house so that is my fault that she hasn't yet been to therapy. She will get her therapy eventually however. As for the clothing on the floor issue.. my wife is very tidy. None of her clothing are ever originally on the floor but mine are. Lola does reach up and take my wife's clothing off of the hooks in the closet and makes nests out of them. We do not have a closet door.", "created_utc": 1668091421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrh2hq/aita_for_calling_her_unbearable/", "score": 1262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's never been to a doctor for these issues so it's truly self diagnosed. She thinks that since she hates loud noises and doesn't like being looked at that she has sensory issues. Not trying to discredit her or anything but it's over the top some days. Like if two people are talking at once she gets super overwhelmed and irritated. Or as mentioned above, if anyone or any **thing** is looking at her, she gets self conscious and pissed off. \n\nOn to the real issue. I got a dog about a year ago. Her name is Lola and she is a Corgi. She's very energetic and needy but training is going well. My wife has a cat, whom we have had for like 4 years I believe. She has always had a problem with my dog. Reason being is the fact that my dog is needy. She loves being touched. She wants to follow us everywhere. She whines when she wants attention She will sleep on any article of clothing we have on the floor that has our scent before sleeping on her dog bed/kennel. She is constantly sniffing the air/floor whenever we are eating and often sniffs the trash can or litter box. But my wife has an issue with most of these behaviors. Mostly the whining but due to the resentment she has gotten from the whining, she takes issue with the dog sleeping on our clothing or even sniffing around whenever we have food. It irritates her to no end. So like whenever the dog starts walking around sniffing us when eating, my wife uses an irritated tone to tell her to get out of the room. Or whenever my wife sees her sleeping on our clothing, she immediately takes the clothes away and says she is \"fucking sick\" of constantly having dog hair on her clothing. I could almost understand if she didn't get as pissed as she does. \n\nOn to the big problem.. yesterday we ate dinner in our bedroom while watching a movie. As soon as Lola saw we had food she came out of her kennel and started sniffing the air and dead pan staring at us while we ate and whined a few times. My wife starts fidgeting but doesn't say anything. Lola starts inching closer to us while staring at my wife because my wife was closest. My wife looks at me and says \"you want to speak to her? Since you get pissed whenever I do.\" I told her to just ignore her and act like she isn't there. So my wife just gets up with her plate and says \"I don't fucking want a dog staring at me while I'm eating! I don't even like it when people stare at me so why should I change how I feel or fake it till I make it to accommodate to your dog?\" I told her she was being fucking unbearable. She takes off and doesn't come home. I'm being told I'm an AH for disrespecting my wife's feelings. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In that case he really needs to get the dog and himself trained. I do stand by that comment.", "I doubt she\u2019s yelling.

She doesn't recognize the activity as forbidden or a transgression because her primary human does not teach her that it's a transgression. Lola probably exists in a constant state of anxiety trying to understand why the woman is upset with her! It would benefit her so much if you would train her to respect your wife's boundaries even a LITTLE, because the dogs home would not be constantly half filled with rising tension!!

They lay in another room while we eat completely out of sight. A begging dog is one of my biggest pet peeves. Also your dog pulls your wifes clothes out of the closet and makes nests out of them? Why are you allowing her to do that? No wonder your wife doesn't like the dog. And who prioritizes buying a house over their partners mental health?

Did y'all even talk about it??\n\nYTA for not actually training your dog. You say she needs it, but clearly you're not doing it.

And by extension making \\*your\\* problem, \\*their\\* problem.\n\nLastly, YTA for prioritizing house over mental health.

I feel like dogs are like children if you don\u2019t want them/don\u2019t like them then you shouldn\u2019t have one because that can lead to mistreatment.

I\u2019m autistic/adhd and sensory issues are so HARD. The way he blew hers off bothers me, like good for him that he doesn\u2019t seem to have them, but he doesn\u2019t get to act like she\u2019s blowing them out of proportion just because his experience isn\u2019t the same.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to save for a house and see a doctor to help with the sensory stuff, hell, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to be spending a shit ton to see a doctor occasionally. The most cost put in will likely be for evaluations at the beginning, after that it\u2019s pretty much maintenance. Also, I think her ability to live comfortably should be more important than being able to buy a house asap. Help with sensory issues can make it so much easier to function and live comfortably. For me, being overstimulated by noise can lead to overheating, which can lead to nausea and even throwing up. No idea what it\u2019s like for her, but if it bothers her as much as it seems to I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Her frustration is understandable, especially since the dog clearly is having behaviors (like whining/begging) reinforced by someone, likely OP.", "Can't understand why anyone was on OP's side before the edits. He dismissed his wife's sensory issues as if they were just made-up/ exaggerated, without having any basis for disbelieving her. He seemed to think his dog's behavior was fine, and wife was just over-sensitive for objecting to it. All of those are extremely annoying and a sign of an untrained dog. When OP said \n\n> I don't want this pushed solely off in my favor here so there are a few things I want to point out. I want legit judgement, not biased.\n\nI literally laughed out loud.
