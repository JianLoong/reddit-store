We just instantly clicked on every level and he is still the best person I know. Unfortunately when we tried dating, my dad found out and made a huge deal about him being in college and dating his \"young\" daughter from high school. I couldn't understand it as we were only 5 years apart and absolutely the same age maturity wise, but dad did not approve and apparently the cursing out / shaming tactics worked on him and he regretfully broke up with me. He said he was cursed out by my dad, called a groomer and that he is taking advantage of me and he do not want to feel like a creep. It broke my heart, but I guess I focused on finishing high school and moving the hell out, so I can be with him in college. Unfortunately by the time I went to college, he was with his girlfriend, who he stayed together all throughout college and so on, and yesterday was their wedding. I am not gonna lie, I congratulated him but I felt really sad by that because I feel that should have been me. I have never met another man like him and I am developing some unhealthy jealousy towards his now wife. But I am working through this and also have created some daddy issue due to my resentment towards my dad.  \nNow to the hypocrisy part. My younger brother who is in high school, came out like a year ago. My family was very supporting and celebrated his journey. Especially my dad, who in the past had said some homophobic remarks have really done a 180 and have been very supporting to my brother and is very protective of him, except who he dates. See my brother has dated few guys who are considerably older than he is and for some reason my dad is perfectly okay with it. The final straw for me was his latest date that he brought to the wedding. My brother is now dating a guy who is 31 (14 year old difference) and my dad took photos with them together all really happy. I just couldn't take it so when we got home, I exploded on my dad on how he could allow my brother to be in relationship with significantly older guy but had a problem with me dating a few years older. He says that my brother is a man and its different for daughters and I won't be able to understand. I asked if his older boyfriend is now not taking advantage of my brother and he said that I am being homophobic by questioning their relationship. I in reply said that he is overcompensating of his previous homophobia by condoning pe\\*\\*philia now. Well he got angry and kicked me out and then told my brother about that. Now both of them are not speaking but I don't think I have said anything wrong here.

A 17 year old dating a 31 year old is even *worse.*  \nYour dad is overcompensating and your brother is blind in love (or in lust).

Save yourself first. Get therapy.", "Nta but tbf it is very weird a 21 year old would want to date a 16 year old but its also weird a 31 year old  is dating a kid fresh out out high school. So I see your point. It's incredibly questionable for your dad to be okay with it. \n\nI do think you took out your jealousy and anger about the ex abd his wife out on your dad tho.", "Your dad was right - college dude scoping out a 16 year old is a fucking creep and you dodged a bullet. \n\nDad should have kept that same energy- your brother\u2019s date is a fucking CREEEP. Probably afraid he would get hit with the homophobe card if he tried. \n\nYou would both probably benefit from dating people who dont have to resort to seeking out minors or barely legal folks because no one their own age is interested in them.

Your younger brother is in high school? And he's dating someone who is 31??!\n\nUhhmmm!!? Call the cops??", "NTA - It is very unfortunate that somehow your dad may be so worried about being perceived as homophobic, he isn't protecting his son the way he should be. A person isn't automatically more mature or ready for more serious/adult relationships because they're gay; 17 is 17 and 31 is... well, yeah, a predator.\n\nI understand you're angry about the double standard and how it affected you, but that anger has absolutely nothing to do with your brother, don't put that on him. Save the anger for dad for another time (and definitely for therapy as well) and approach them both with concern for your brother's safety and well-being.", "ESH- yes a 21yo guy should not be dating a 16yo KID.  Same with a 31yo and a 17yo.  Anyone over 19yo should not be dating people 17 or younger.  \n\nYou bother were groomed by older people, neither is ok. Your Dad was only worried about you getting pregnant at 16 most likely.!", "ESH. You were groomed a 16 year old with a 21 year old? Y\u2019all had nothing to really build a foundation on. What life experiences have y\u2019all shared at that point?\nYour brother same thing.\nYour dad should view it the same and handle it the same. It won\u2019t make your dad homophobic if he is literally doing solely for age reasons.", "ESH\n\nHe was correct when you were underage\n\nYour brother may be over the age of consent, but it is definitely a questionable and gross age difference", "I thought we had a sweet home Alabama situation based on that headline", "NTA.\n\nYour dad was understandably protective of you, but didn't listen to you and acted pretty harshly.\n\nNow, he condones a relationship that is probably dangerous for your brother. You're absolutely right to be upset.\n\nAs far as your brother goes, it may be hard to reach him, especially from your position.", "I think that your father is attempting to do right by both of his children, he rightfully protected you from a potentially dangerous predator and in his eyes, he's now trying to support his son, who has ventured into a relationship he may not like but can't really say much about. This is a huge problem, that doesn't have an easy solution. \n\nIf he were to do the same to your brother's BF, it wouldn't be perceived as a problem with age so much as a problem with 2 guys being together.\n\nThe past homophobic comments + not being okay with a new BF = Homophobe \n\nDoesn't matter if it's true, doesn't matter if he's trying to protect his son, he'd be labeled a homophobe from the son for sure, and I think that is exactly what he's trying to avoid happening. \n\nI think this dad is trying to ensure his son doesn't go NC for being homophobic.\n\nNAH, hopefully dad figures out a way to make it clear he only has an issue with this ridiculous age gap and not any other part.\n\nAssuming of course that this is what he's thinking and not that he's being ridiculously hypocritical.", "Both of y\u2019all are fucked", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As a 21yo, I would have stayed the hell away from anyone under 18yo, that's just asking for trouble. Maybe you had and still have rose tainted glasses about the guy.\n\n31yo with a 17yo is even worst. The difference in age (14yo) have nothing to do with it, it's the age of both of you and your brother that is the issues. Few people will care about a 14yo age difference if the two people are 30yo and 44yo. But at 17yo, yes it matter. It's sound like your father is ashamed of his homophobia of the past and so his guilt make him fear of objected to anything about your brother's romantic relationship. \n\n>He says that my brother is a man and its different for daughters and I won't be able to understand.\n\nThat's a sad reality.

You\u2019re dad is right, it\u2019s creepy. You say five years isn\u2019t a lot, but would you date a mature 11 year old at 16? No you wouldn\u2019t. At 16 5 years is literally a 3rd of your life. It\u2019s a lot. But you\u2019re brother\u2019s relationship is gross & I agree with you completely that your dad is being a hypocrite and unfortunately is letting some disgusting things happen by supporting that relationship, especially when he reacted the way he did to yours. Only thing I can think is that he believes he has to support it or that means he\u2019s homophobic (and I base this on his own comment to you).", "NTA\n\nDouble standards suck. I think he's being protective of you but that doesn't make it right.  There is also the law to consider, depending on when one is considered an adult can make age gaps in younger couples illegal.", "You can't make a blanket statement that covers everyone. I know some 16 yo's who are a lot more mature than some 21 yo's, male and female", "As many gays as i know, it seems to be a thing in gay community. Since the dating pool is much smaller then big age gaps are quite common. At least that has been my observation.", "how is she TA here?", "Completely agree. There are laws about this for a reason. Even if she feels like the level of maturity they had were on the same level, it's not. Same goes for the bothers relatioship.", "how is she TA here?", "I agree, but a 31 year old man dating a 17 year old boy is even ickier, which is OP's argument. Both are/were inappropriate relationships.", "Good. They are the exception, not the norm.", "Yeah, but you CAN make the statement that it's illegal.", "Doesn't make it any less creepy or inappropriate. Her brother is still a minor.", "I guess its a juvenile argument coming from an adult tho. She should have realized by Now the dude tried to groom her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I never they are the norm. Just that it is possible", "Her bro is in hi school. Bro's crush is 31. 14 year difference between bro & his bf. That makes bro 17. That is illegal.", "Not always. In a number of American States the age of consent is 16, and I believe it is also 16 in the UK. Do I think it's okay for a 21 y/o to date a 16 y/o? Hell no! But it's not necessarily illegal. Should be, but isn't.", "No, no, I'm saying BOTH situations are illegal and more than a little gross.", "I think there's a stipulation with that. It's called the Romeo and Juliet law and it deals with couples close in age where one is a minor and the other isn't, but it generally caps at 4 years age difference."]}
