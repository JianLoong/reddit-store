We just instantly clicked on every level and he is still the best person I know. Unfortunately when we tried dating, my dad found out and made a huge deal about him being in college and dating his \"young\" daughter from high school. I couldn't understand it as we were only 5 years apart and absolutely the same age maturity wise, but dad did not approve and apparently the cursing out / shaming tactics worked on him and he regretfully broke up with me. He said he was cursed out by my dad, called a groomer and that he is taking advantage of me and he do not want to feel like a creep. It broke my heart, but I guess I focused on finishing high school and moving the hell out, so I can be with him in college. Unfortunately by the time I went to college, he was with his girlfriend, who he stayed together all throughout college and so on, and yesterday was their wedding. I am not gonna lie, I congratulated him but I felt really sad by that because I feel that should have been me. I have never met another man like him and I am developing some unhealthy jealousy towards his now wife. But I am working through this and also have created some daddy issue due to my resentment towards my dad.  \nNow to the hypocrisy part. My younger brother who is in high school, came out like a year ago. My family was very supporting and celebrated his journey. Especially my dad, who in the past had said some homophobic remarks have really done a 180 and have been very supporting to my brother and is very protective of him, except who he dates. See my brother has dated few guys who are considerably older than he is and for some reason my dad is perfectly okay with it. The final straw for me was his latest date that he brought to the wedding. My brother is now dating a guy who is 31 (14 year old difference) and my dad took photos with them together all really happy. I just couldn't take it so when we got home, I exploded on my dad on how he could allow my brother to be in relationship with significantly older guy but had a problem with me dating a few years older. He says that my brother is a man and its different for daughters and I won't be able to understand. I asked if his older boyfriend is now not taking advantage of my brother and he said that I am being homophobic by questioning their relationship. I in reply said that he is overcompensating of his previous homophobia by condoning pe\\*\\*philia now. Well he got angry and kicked me out and then told my brother about that.

You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. You\u2019re a victim\u201d\n\nHoly gas light Batman. \n\nY\u2019all Redditors need to check yourselves.", "No one seems to have that problem with my brothers bf.", "I think this age difference is inappropriate: 17 and 31 is just too big no matter what. 16 and 21 is also not cool\n\nbut the reason a smaller dating pool makes larger gaps more acceptable is this: in a large dating pool, why would an older person want to date someone younger and not their age? likely because they have some immaturity that people their age don't tolerate, and that's why they're single. but if the dating pool is smaller, being single can not be because of a flaw but because of the small dating pool", "Maybe where you live, but not around here. \n\nCreepy and gross in the eyes of pretty much everyone? Yes. Illegal? No.", "I think the dad acting like this is about homophobia is a red herring.\n\nIf the ages are all of a sudden appropriate - then dad was lying when he broke OP up from that relationship years ago.", "so you knew this guy for how long?", "Everyone here has a problem with it, it\u2019s extremely weird that your dad doesn\u2019t.", "And that is a separate issue altogether. For what it's worth, as far as I have read in here there doesn't really seem to be a lot of support for your brother not being protected.\n\nYour Dad was right in how he approached your situation and *extremely* wrong in how he's approaching your brother.\n\nThe problem isn't that you were prevented from seeing that guy, the problem is that he isn't preventing your brother. \n\nYou are right to point out the double standard, but only because it could have helped to protect your brother. It hasn't and that is disappointing.\n\nYou seem awfully caught up on this one guy. That's just something you're going to have to let go. There's every chance that you're measuring any current guy against the fantasy of what you believe your old flame would have been instead of what the reality of it would have been. Of course no guy is the same as him, no other guy is him.", "It varies wildly by state. The Romeo and Juliet laws that exist in some states provide an exemption to the age of consent for kids who are BOTH under the age of consent or separated by only a few years. For example, in a state where the age of consent is 16 and the parties involved were 15 and 17 or both 15, the law would probably cover that. In a state where the age of consent is 18 and the parties were 16 and 19, again, probably covered (IF there is a close-age exception, which is not true in all states). \n\nBut if the age of consent is 16, then the age-gap law doesn't apply at all to anyone 16 or older. So for instance, in Washington state the age of consent is 16. That means it's perfectly legal for a 16 year old to have a sexual relationship with ANY other consenting person over the age of 16. Doesn't matter if they're 17, 25, or 62. Gross? Yes. Illegal? No. \n\nAnd if that shocks you, wait until you find about how many child marriages there are in the US. Perfectly legal ones, too.", "I'm in Australia and unless the older partner has authority over the younger partner (such as being a teacher being the main example) our age of consent is 16 in all but two states (where it's 17).  My understanding is that in a lot of Europe it works similarly with the AoC being a pretty unambiguous 16 or 17 with exceptions generally being as above.  AoC being pinned at 18 is very much a US media thing rather than an actual global standard (even among westerns english speaking countries).", "Not gross to me. Just not buying that a 16-year-old is the same as a 21-year-old.", "Who? the guy I was interested in. I said he was cousin of my friend so know him since he was a teenager himself. My brothers bf is only in the picture for last 6 month perhaps.", "That\u2019s not true of every state.

It's really hard to make laws like that at the federal level if it can't somehow be tied to interstate movement and commerce. Marriages have to be recognized in other states, so they have a handle for that. But teens having sex in their own state would be super hard to make a federal law about, unfortunately.", "f'real\n\nop met her boyfriend when, like, he was fifteen and she was ten? he as sixteen and she was eleven? he met her as a pre-teen, watched her grow up, and then entered a relationship with her?\n\nIT'S ACTUALLY SO MUCH WORSE THAT YOU KNEW HIM SINCE HE WAS A TEENAGER"]}
