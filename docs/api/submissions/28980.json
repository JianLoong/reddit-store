His father\u2019s family has this tradition where each year one of the aunties or uncles will host the christmas. So for past three years his aunty has been hosting Christmas. The first time i went there they asked me to bring something, i made my special goat leg roast and everyone seemed to love it. I will admit i am from muslim family, we dont celebrate Christmas and i am from a different culture and i only know how to cook south asian food. I Dont eat pork and not big fan of lamb so i made something i liked and know how to cook. Everybody seemed to like it and nothing was left. Anyway, the first time i went i asked where is the toilet my partner and  showed me the toilet and i used it. next  Christmas his aunty decided to host it again, she asked me not to bring any goat or anything south asian as its not christmasy, asked me to bring a simple salad. Honestly i just always fuck up salad and the way i make my salad is spicy and is very south asian. So i bought salad from super market and took it( i was being a bit petty). Anyway, this year i had to go to the bathroom, so i asked my partner to be sure, where is the toilet and he shows me and i use it. After 30 minutes she pulls me aside and asks me not to use that toilet and shows me the one i should use, she said it was her new guest toilet. I didnt think of it much, we left after a few minutes. Again next year she is hosting the Christmas AGAIN, this year she says no one eats store bought stuff, just buy some fruits like water melon and berries and stuff. I live two hours drive away from her place and summer in Australia is absolutely horrible, so picked fruits that wont be a go off. Anyway i reach the venue, we spend the time and then i have to use the toilet, so i see everyone using the one i used the previous year, all the family members, i felt insulted, so i asked her which toilet should i use, my mother in law told me to use the one everyone was using but the aunty literally jumped and said no no, use the other toilet, thats the guest toilet. I saw my mother in law went pale. I told my partner your aunty literally reminded me the movie \u201cThe Help\u201d. He couldn\u2019t believe me so to test he went and asked his aunty which toilet to use, she said the family one. On our way home i decided not to attend the family Christmas anymore, first of all there is no food for me,everything they have to eat is ham or bacon based so i basically get to eat a sad piece of chicken and i felt she doesnt want a brown person in the house. As much as it is for my dignity i dont want to cause her any discomfort in her own house. My partner told me she has some mental disorder and I shouldn\u2019t take it to heart as it causing her to behave that way and I shouldn\u2019t disrespect his family tradition but i just cant bring myself to go there anymore.\nAm i the asshole for refusing to go to his family Christmas, am I imagining stuff?", "created_utc": 1697368094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178d3oo/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_christmas/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And, you have a husband problem. Ask him if family tradition includes racism and being disrespected by your own husband. \n\nNTA.", "Hey OP? \n\nCome by my place for Christmas, I\u2019d love to try your goat leg roast! \n\nAlso, we might have a ham, but also lots of chicken and other things. We have one toilet, so you\u2019ll have to share with everyone else\u2026 also, we\u2019re not very religious, so it\u2019s more an excuse to have a party and a good time. There will be alcohol, but don\u2019t  drink it if don\u2019t want to, I have heaps of different softies and sparkling waters since I rarely drink alcohol!\n\nAlthough, you might want to avoid the trifle, it\u2019s mums speciality, (and it\u2019s really good!) but as she\u2019s gotten older, she seems to up the sherry a lot! We advise all designated drivers to avoid it just in case!\n\nAnd yeah, you are totally NTA - tell your other half to man up and defend you - she\u2019s behaving inappropriately and I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA - it\u2019s not disrespecting his family traditions to expect to be treated like everyone else.  \nShe is insulting you by making you use a different toilet and a mental disorder doesn\u2019t excuse that.  \nIf you want to take food you could make a ginger bread house or Christmas Tree ?  \nPut it in an esky you won\u2019t have to worry about it going bad in the heat and Christmas in Australia does tend to include ginger bread (Just don\u2019t put ice in the esky)", "NTA. Your partner should be standing up for you and this is clearly a racist household. The pettiness with the salad is a little silly but (and I say this as an Aussie with a big family who also rotate christmases between the aunties), they absolutely should be accommodating your dietary needs, especially if they are religious. Not doing so is racist, and the last I checked that wasn\u2019t a mental health problem, just a shitty person problem. Sorry they\u2019re not being nice. Perhaps you could offer to host and treat the whole family to some lovely Asian hospitality. Multiculturalism is incredible, I\u2019m sad they\u2019re not appreciating you and your likely very delicious food.", "NTA, it\u2019s totally like \u201cthe help\u201c however, Based on how many Christmases you\u2019ve been to, this relationship seems to be on the serious side of the spectrum, going forward, if his family decides to keep this tradition up, how will you handle this situation\u2026 the blatant disrespect can\u2019t just be tolerated, are you never going to attend another Christmas? Or spend it together with your partner? It\u2019s seems he\u2019s going to keep going to the aunts house if she continues to host. If this relationship continues, I\u2019m assuming there will be wedding bells in which the aunt will be your aunt as well\u2026 so at this point, if you don\u2019t show, it\u2019s going to be the to one set the precedent that her behavior is tolerated and accepted. I would suggest going but setting down some ground rules, between you and your partner, should you both show up and this is her behavior, how will you both handle the satiation, and how will you explain it to everyone else so that they know it is no longer tolerated. For example, use the same bathroom everyone else is using, should she have a reaction, you can state loudly in front of everyone this was the one everyone else was using why am I the only one to use a different one. And make her explain her behavior. Bring a dish, who gives that it\u2019s not Christmassy, make what you want to share with the family cause that\u2019s was Christmas is about to share and being together family. If she says something, call her out on it. If you continue to let her behavior happen, she\u2019s going think you\u2019re going to continue to accept it. If you really want to be Christmassy, then bring dessert?  At this point, if she\u2019s not showing respect to you as a person you have no obligation to do the same in her home, in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nI hope your partner is going to support you here.  Perhaps this year a different aunt or uncle needs to host Christmas.\n\nAs Christmas is not that important to you, you can just send your partner and you just stay home.\n\nBut you'll have some thinking to do if you decide to have kids.  They will want to celebrate Christmas as your partner will be expecting it.  Then he will want to take them to Christmas lunch to see the kids grandparents.  Will you just let him go, or will you be going to.  This will be more relevant when they are toddlers and older rather than when they are little babies that you might still be breastfeeding.\n\nYou need to have a chat to your partner about where he stands with his aunts disrespect of you.", "So, your partner wants you to believe that a mental disorder has caused his aunt to be\u2026.racist? That\u2019s\u2026one explanation. Or she\u2019s actually just racist. You don\u2019t have to accept that kind of behavior from anyone, let alone a family member.

Your partner is a raging asshole for bringing bigots into your life and making excuses for them.", "NTA His family is awful and almost certainly racist. The fact that no one seems to be telling the aunt off or hosting an alternate event is a problem. If you marry this guy, you should never let your kids be around this woman without you present\u2014clearly no one else will defend them.\n\nThat said, for future events/relationships, when you\u2019re invited to bring something to a holiday dinner, you don\u2019t bring a main dish (unless you\u2019re specifically asked to)! Bring a side\u2014a vegetable or a rice or bread based dish\u2014or bring an appetizer or a dessert. If your host is known for something or particularly proud of a dish, don\u2019t bring something that competes. Bonus points for finding out what else is being served and bringing something that coordinates. But turning up for Christmas dinner with a whole roast of your own without coordinating with the host is kind of rude.", "NTA. Racist old people exist, unfortunately it's part of life, and avoiding them is the best policy. The real problem is your partner. He needs to get a damn spine and stand up for you. I'd be a dick about the whole tjong and play The Help every night from now until Christmas. \n\n\nPlease please please send racist auntie a \"whites only restroom\" and a \"colored restoom\" signs for her bathroom for Christmas. Get your favorite relative to video her unwrapping it, and you can laugh at her from the comfort of your own home. \n\n\nI wish you were here - I throw a multinational Xmas party with halal food for my Muslim cousins, and you'd have a blast. We even play Christmas (and Hanukkah) carols from different cultures (including one in Arabic which was really hard to find).

She's a racist jerk.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly I tried to see both sides but that family confuses me. Why would they make you use a different toilet as if your piss/shit is radioactive? Having a mental disorder isn't an excuse.\n\nBut on the other hand they shouldn't change up the food to accommodate you superficially since they are the ones in the majority. They could still be more tolerant though and not ask you to bring salad or fruit?
