His father\u2019s family has this tradition where each year one of the aunties or uncles will host the christmas. So for past three years his aunty has been hosting Christmas. \n\nThe first time i went there they asked me to bring something, i made my special goat leg roast and everyone seemed to love it. I will admit i am from muslim family, we dont celebrate Christmas and i am from a different culture and i only know how to cook south asian food. I Dont eat pork and not big fan of lamb so i made something i liked and know how to cook. Everybody seemed to like it and nothing was left. \n\nAnyway, the first time i went i asked where is the toilet my partner and  showed me the toilet and i used it. next Christmas his aunty decided to host it again, she asked me not to bring any goat or anything south asian as its not christmasy, asked me to bring a simple salad. Honestly i just always fuck up salad and the way i make my salad is spicy and is very south asian. So i bought salad from super market and took it( i was being a bit petty). \nAnyway, this year i had to go to the bathroom, so i asked my partner to be sure, where is the toilet and he shows me and i use it. After 30 minutes she pulls me aside and asks me not to use that toilet and shows me the one i should use, she said it was her new guest toilet. I didnt think of it much, we left after a few minutes. \n\nAgain next year she is hosting the Christmas AGAIN, this year she says no one eats store bought stuff, just buy some fruits like water melon and berries and stuff. I live two hours drive away from her place and summer in Australia is absolutely horrible, so picked fruits that wont be a go off. \n\nAnyway i reach the venue, we spend the time and then i have to use the toilet, so i see everyone using the one i used the previous year, all the family members, i felt insulted, so i asked her which toilet should i use, my mother in law told me to use the one everyone was using but the aunty literally jumped and said no no, use the other toilet, thats the guest toilet. I saw my mother in law went pale.\n\n I told my partner your aunty literally reminded me the movie \u201cThe Help\u201d. He couldn\u2019t believe me so to test he went and asked his aunty which toilet to use, she said the family one. On our way home i decided not to attend the family Christmas anymore, first of all there is no food for me,everything they have to eat is ham or bacon based so i basically get to eat a sad piece of chicken that i have to pick off another dish  and i felt she doesnt want a brown person in the house. \n\nAs much as it is for my dignity i dont want to cause her any discomfort in her own house. My partner told me she has some mental disorder and I shouldn\u2019t take it to heart as it causing her to behave that way and I shouldn\u2019t disrespect his family tradition but i just cant bring myself to go there anymore.\n\nAm i the asshole for refusing to go to his family Christmas, am I imagining stuff?", "created_utc": 1697368094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178d3oo/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_christmas/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your partner should be standing up for you and this is clearly a racist household. The pettiness with the salad is a little silly but (and I say this as an Aussie with a big family who also rotate christmases between the aunties), they absolutely should be accommodating your dietary needs, especially if they are religious. Not doing so is racist, and the last I checked that wasn\u2019t a mental health problem, just a shitty person problem. Sorry they\u2019re not being nice.

Or spend it together with your partner? It\u2019s seems he\u2019s going to keep going to the aunts house if she continues to host. If this relationship continues, I\u2019m assuming there will be wedding bells in which the aunt will be your aunt as well\u2026 so at this point, if you don\u2019t show, it\u2019s going to be the to one set the precedent that her behavior is tolerated and accepted. I would suggest going but setting down some ground rules, between you and your partner, should you both show up and this is her behavior, how will you both handle the satiation, and how will you explain it to everyone else so that they know it is no longer tolerated. For example, use the same bathroom everyone else is using, should she have a reaction, you can state loudly in front of everyone this was the one everyone else was using why am I the only one to use a different one. And make her explain her behavior. Bring a dish, who gives that it\u2019s not Christmassy, make what you want to share with the family cause that\u2019s was Christmas is about to share and being together family. If she says something, call her out on it. If you continue to let her behavior happen, she\u2019s going think you\u2019re going to continue to accept it. If you really want to be Christmassy, then bring dessert?

Bring a side\u2014a vegetable or a rice or bread based dish\u2014or bring an appetizer or a dessert.

I have a goat leg in the freezer and now I know exactly what I'm doing with it!\n\nAlso I'm so sorry you were treated this way. You sound like a lovely, generous person and you deserve better.", "Yes. Really, they shouldn\u2019t be going at all. Invite everyone else to OP\u2019s place.", "I mean, in my family we\u2019d be trying to figure out how many things we could ask you to bring every holiday \ud83d\ude06. \u201cIs it rude to ask her to bring the goat and the samosas?\u201d", "Well I would come!!  Except I am in Canada and the logistics would be a bit dicey!  But we\u2019re I local, I would absolutely love to be there", "Good for you! If we were on the same continent I\u2019d invite y\u2019all over for dessert!", "I would definitely! I love to cook and my goat roast and my biriyani is very loved. i used to sell when i lived near a big town. Everybody loved them, mostly Australians. \n\nI know when you go to Christmas i cant be that fussed about halal butcher or anything (after moving to australia and this town i live, which is so far away from any halal shops).\n\nI try to accomodate as much as possible, i will scrape out chicken and veggies from salads (all of the food would have pork product), i would also have to be mindful so i dont scarpe everything off, so usually i eat before going there or after.", "It was very very embarrassing, when she pulled me aside.", "Doves are delicious!", "Thank you! I hope you enjoy it.", "I would love that, i love cooking and it makes me really happy to share my food with my family. You can ask me to bring as many things as you like. Would love that!", "Honestly should have moved to canada, so many lovely people.", "Plenty of halal butchers here and the regular butcher I go to has separate fridges for halal and kosher meats. \n\nAnd homemade biryani is the best!", "I would travel to you for goat leg roast and homemade biryani. NTA, everyone has a different menu for Christmas and you put in so much effort to have it be belittled.", "The sad thing is SHE is the one who should be embarrassed because she is a racist old dinosaur and her views have no place in the world", "Well thank you very kindly!  I think so too!", "Perfect! I think now is should have moved to canada or usa!"]}
