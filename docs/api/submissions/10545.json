I was leaning the opposite until I saw that they have been together longer than your BIL and his partner.", "Well, you left out a very important piece of information here: how long have your stepsister and her boyfriend been together?\n\nBecause I'll be frank: the \"engaged and married couples only except for this one long term relationship but nobody else\" thing doesn't really hold water. \n\nIt's your wedding and you're entitled to invite (or not invite) whoever you like, but you don't get to complain about the consequences/fallout of making that kind of choice. If your stepsister's relationship is long enough to consider long-term, you *are* disrespecting that relationship with your decision.

Modern etiquette expects you to treat couples who are cohabiting as though they are married, regardless of the legal status of their relationship.\n\nSo does your fiance's brother live with his bf?

They count as married for social purposes. They get invited together.\n\nSo YTA.\n\nAnd it seems like the reason you don't like your stepsister's bf is that your fiance insulted his nephew, and got called out for it?

Suck it up and move on.", "YTA because boyfriend/girlfriend is not \"+1\". A +1 is an open invite to bring a guest, a partner is invited by name. I hate the idea of \"no ring, no bring\". I know people together 10+ years with no plans of getting married and people engaged after 6 months. \n\n\nIf you don't want to invite him, don't invite him. If you don't want to invite partners, ok, but that's basically saying \"When you come to celebrate our love, you can't have the person you love with you\". \n\n\nAlso, how many people will your step sister know there? It's a bit different when there is a group of friends who all don't have their partners invited...if your step sister is not close to your family at all, except parents, that could basically be her sitting on her phone the whole time or occasional awkward small talk.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If it IS serious enough, OP can clarify but she still got an NTA from me so it's not like my vote would change.", ">Since she was 17-18, so about 15 years\n\nI'm sorry in what world is 15 years not a committed long term relationship??\n\nShe should have been honest instead of making up excuses.", "15 years?!? YTA and your post is very misleading.", "Then you're definitely the asshole.", "That's kind of unfair then. I'm all for inviting who you want to your wedding but if you're going to make an exception for fiancee brother Bf of 11 years then you can't use time together as the reason and that was a bit misleading from your post. It sounded like SS and her bf had been together less time.", "Yeah YTA. If you stuck rigidly to only engaged/married couples, you wouldn\u2019t be. It would be odd and people may not be a fan if they couldn\u2019t bring their partner, but it\u2019s a fair decision. You allowing your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother\u2019s boyfriend but not your stepsisters (who she\u2019s dated longer!!) makes it personal and rude.", "Yes. I get that. It doesn\u2019t seem like they were close. Thing is, we don\u2019t know why the BF turns off both groom and bride. I wish OP would have included this. Edit: Thank you folks. Changes all. I was thinking ( and wrongly so) SS\u2019s BF had issue with fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother. How wrong I was.", "Probably because op assumes her ss has the same view on marriage time-line as she does and thus is mad op is getting married before her.", "She's judging stepsister and stepsisters boyfriend's relationship saying if op's devaluing of\nTheir 15 years together makes ss feel like op is devaluing the relationship then ss and boyfriend didn't have much of a relationship. She's not talking about her and her step sister's relationship with that rude line.", "I think OP left out that information intentionally because it looks bad lol.", "I don't think it's misleading. She never said she's not inviting the boyfriend because they haven't been together long enough or something. She said it's because they don't get along with SS boyfriend (and because she's not that close to SS). It's got nothing to do with duration of relationship. Maybe the boyfriend did something to OP or her fiance? And the mom also siding with SS gives me golden child vibes, also OP says SS is jealous of her and her relationship. Either way it's their choice.\n\n(Also 11 years is not the same as 5 years. Yes I'd consider 5 years a long term relationship, but 11 is not the same by the way)", "It\u2019s always suspect when the key factors are omitted from the OP and then the truth trickles out in the comments.", "> shortened version is that my fiance and my stepsister's boyfriend got into a major argument because my fiance (or my bf, we weren't engaged then) said something about her boyfriend's nephew at an event. Stepsister's boyfriend made a big show and humiliated my fiance in front of everyone, not even in private\n\nOP is mad because her fianc\u00e9 said something mean about the bf\u2019s nephew and he got called out in front of everyone", "Because the groom bullied a literal child and the boyfriend told him off for it and the groom was humiliated because he got called out for his shitty behaviour", "There's a good word for those kind of people. I believe it's a combined word that involves synonyms for donkey and cavity.", ">Since she was 17-18, so about 15 years\n\n15 years.... Not 5 .... 15 years..\n\nShe's making excuses instead of being honest and acting like an adult.", "I think that's just a difference in how we're reading the post.\n\nThe way I read it was that they said no plus 1s except for this one couple who have been together for 11 years. That indicates to me that OP puts more weight on long term relationships. OP never mentioned in the original post how long SS and BF were together. OP only says that SS used that couple as an example to disagree and then was told that they don't get along with her bf and \"they're closer\" (I'm not sure if that means physically or friendship wise). That's where it felt fuzzy to me. I'm happy to chalk it up to OP didn't think to put it in plus difference in the way its read but it is something OP should be aware of.\n\nI 100% agree that OP can invite whoever she wants and shouldn't invite anyone they don't want but it should be made transparent and she'll have to accept hard feelings in some places.\n\nIt could be golden child vibes on the moms part. Or she simply doesn't understand why the fianc\u00e9e's brother can bring his 11 year relationship along but SS can't bring her 15 year relationship along. Like me, OPs mom may have assumed that they were allowed due to the length of their relationship, only to find out its because OP and the fianc\u00e9e like his brothers fianc\u00e9e more\n\nEdit: I saw your parentheses after the fact and had to ask where you got 5 from? OP says 15 years SS and BF were together. That's a big difference from 5 and is longer than 11 years... so you're right... 11 years is not the same thing as 15 years. My parents have been with each of their SO's that long. 15 years is a long time and I'd consider that basically married", "Wow. Spot on.", "Thank you.", "I am so glad I got the information. I changed my vote. Omitting stuff like this is an AH move!"]}
