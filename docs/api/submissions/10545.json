I was leaning the opposite until I saw that they have been together longer than your BIL and his partner.", "Well, you left out a very important piece of information here: how long have your stepsister and her boyfriend been together?\n\nBecause I'll be frank: the \"engaged and married couples only except for this one long term relationship but nobody else\" thing doesn't really hold water. \n\nIt's your wedding and you're entitled to invite (or not invite) whoever you like, but you don't get to complain about the consequences/fallout of making that kind of choice. If your stepsister's relationship is long enough to consider long-term, you *are* disrespecting that relationship with your decision.

Modern etiquette expects you to treat couples who are cohabiting as though they are married, regardless of the legal status of their relationship.\n\nSo does your fiance's brother live with his bf?

They count as married for social purposes. They get invited together.\n\nSo YTA.\n\nAnd it seems like the reason you don't like your stepsister's bf is that your fiance insulted his nephew, and got called out for it?

Suck it up and move on.", "YTA because boyfriend/girlfriend is not \"+1\". A +1 is an open invite to bring a guest, a partner is invited by name. I hate the idea of \"no ring, no bring\". I know people together 10+ years with no plans of getting married and people engaged after 6 months. \n\n\nIf you don't want to invite him, don't invite him. If you don't want to invite partners, ok, but that's basically saying \"When you come to celebrate our love, you can't have the person you love with you\". \n\n\nAlso, how many people will your step sister know there? It's a bit different when there is a group of friends who all don't have their partners invited...if your step sister is not close to your family at all, except parents, that could basically be her sitting on her phone the whole time or occasional awkward small talk.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That indicates to me that OP puts more weight on long term relationships. OP never mentioned in the original post how long SS and BF were together. OP only says that SS used that couple as an example to disagree and then was told that they don't get along with her bf and \"they're closer\" (I'm not sure if that means physically or friendship wise).
