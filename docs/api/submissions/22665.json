{"id": 22665, "submission_id": "15423ep", "title": "AITA for trying to get my daughter to switch schools?", "selftext": "My ex and I share custody of our 12 year old daughter, Kelly. She was 3 when we split. We have a court order that we have to share the cost of her education (through her graduating high school) and we have a 2 yes, 1 no policy. We did this as we always intended for her to attend private schools, which is quite the investment. Plus, she\u2019s both of our kid. Kelly\u2019s been a private school that focuses in STEM. It\u2019s K-12, so she\u2019s been there since kindergarten. She loves it. The only issue has been it\u2019s a bit of a drive (45 minutes) and they don\u2019t have busses. We\u2019ve tried to find carpool situations but the only person from the school in our area moved a few years ago. No relatives nearby to help. We tried hiring someone to drive her but they weren\u2019t reliable. Still, it\u2019s been worth the sacrifice. \n\nImportant note, Kelly lives with me during the week and sees her dad on the weekends. I am the one who brings her to and from school. \n\nLast year, I remarried. My husband brought 2 children into the relationship. They\u2019re 16 & 17. Both attend a private school in town. Similar issue with no bussing, we also don\u2019t have their own cars as we can\u2019t afford that. My husband is a widower, so he\u2019s their only parent. He starts work at 6 am, so it\u2019s up to me to get the kids to school every day. It has been a bit of a mess trying to get everyone there on time. My step-children\u2019s private school doesn\u2019t have before or after school programs and starts after Kelly\u2019s. It\u2019s a tight squeeze to get her there, then get back to their school. \n\nAfter much discussion, my husband and I decided it\u2019d be for the best for Kelly to start at her step-siblings\u2019 school. We talked to my ex about it and he was very hesitant but said if Kelly wanted it, he\u2019d be on board.\n\nKelly doesn\u2019t want to. This school doesn\u2019t have a STEM program. She doesn\u2019t want to leave her friends. She asked why her step-siblings don\u2019t have to move to her school and I said it\u2019s because it\u2019s more than my husband can afford. I\u2019d chip in, but I can\u2019t afford to pay 2.5 tuitions (the half being what I pay for hers). Plus, they aren\u2019t into STEM or science, which is what the school heavily focuses on.\n\nKelly is refusing to go. I\u2019ve tried talking to her, bribing her, etc. She isn\u2019t budging. Therefore, neither is her dad. It\u2019s frustrating and I\u2019ve voiced that. I even tried the compromise that it\u2019d just be until her step-siblings graduated (2 years!!) and she said, then I can easily put up with this for 2 years.\n\nNow she\u2019s been at her dad\u2019s and says she\u2019s not coming home until I drop the matter. I said I want to talk about it more but she refuses. AITA?\n\nEDIT: As it\u2019s come up several times. Prior to me, my husband and his kids lived closer to their school. Now, they live with me and that\u2019s out of walking distance. \n\nMy step kids are on financial aid for school. We have a mortgage. It isn\u2019t just the cost of the car but gas and insurance. Yes, I can afford my daughter\u2019s tuition and a driver at one point, but I was splitting the cost with my ex, who makes far more.\n\nEDIT 2: The money saved from going from 2 homes to 1 has gone to medical debt from his wife dying of cancer, plus helping me pay off my mortgage. We don\u2019t have the money. There\u2019s no public transport. No one is willing to take them.", "created_utc": 1689789511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15423ep/aita_for_trying_to_get_my_daughter_to_switch/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You decided it would be best for YOU.\n\nYour daughter has a valid point.  Why does she have to give up everything?\n\nGet the older kids their school permits and a used car to drive themselves to school.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You have a child who actually LIKES going to school, and you pull her out because of your stepchildren. Ask your husband to drive his own kids before work, instead of neglecting your own.", "You can afford three kids in private school and to hire a driver but can't afford cars for the teenagers?\n\nThat's laughable. Get them cheap banger cars like most teens get or tell them to save up and buy their own car like the rest.\n\nBut you can absolutely afford a car, just maybe not one as nice as your apparently lifestyle would be accustomed too.\n\nAnd YTA. It's sounds like she's in the better school and it wouldn't be such a tight run if she was dropped off a bit earlier (not a hardship for her). You can't just uproot her social life, aspirations (STEM) etc like that because it's easier for your new family (which she didn't get a say in). Maybe you should switch so she lives with her dad in the week and you at weekends to make school transport easier or hire a better/more reliable driver for her. But she should stay in the school she's in, why should she get a raw deal because it's inconvenient for you and your new family when she as your bio daughter should come first. If hubby can't afford his kids school fees that's his problem not hers.", "YTA. Sounds like you are prioritizing your stepkids and new husband. Poor Kelly.", "YTA. You are prioritizing your husband and stepkids.", "> Now she\u2019s been at her dad\u2019s and says she\u2019s not coming home until I drop the matter.\n\nSounds like you need to reverse the custody agreement?\nLet her dad drive her to the STEM school everyday.\n\nHow did you husband manage with his kids before marrying you?", "YTA. Your husband said he would agree IF she WANTED to. She doesn\u2019t so he\u2019s not agreeing. 2 yes 1 no remember. His vote is no bc she didn\u2019t want to. Drop it and move on. Now the question becomes how did your husband magically get his 16 and 17 year old teenagers to school before you got married and took over it. He had it figured out before.", "What did her dad say? If you switched the schedule and she stayed with him during the week, could he take her to school?", "YTA\n\nIt's not best for Kelly at all. It's convenient for you. You made the offer and the other two parties involved, including Kelly, who's the one who's opinion matters the most here, disagreed. You lost. Move on. \n\nFind a different way for her or the older kids to commute if that's the problem. You mentioned there is nobody else in the area who goes to Kelly's school. What about the step-kids' school? Is there anyone they could carpool with? Do they have any friends who drive to school who might be willing to pick them up? If they can't be dropped off at the school early, can you drop them off at a friend's house who they can then carpool with? Can you get a taxi service daily?\n\nFind a different solution. From your daughter's perspective, you're prioritizing your new family over her. I'm sure this isn't your intention or how you feel, but it's how it's being perceived by her. You got a new husband with new kids and suddenly Kelly is a problem and has to uproot her entire life to conform with the new family. You've already damaged the relationship and her trust in you just by suggesting and pushing the school change. If you force the issue your daughter is going to be extremely resentful to you and might never trust you again.\n\nAnd to the \"you can put up with it for 2 years\" point, 2 years is 17% of her entire lived life so far. It may not sound like a long time to you, but for her it's an eternity. And if you think back to that age, those 2 years are going to include the beginning of High School. That's an incredibly formidable period in a kid's life. Don't make her give that up just to be more convenient for your new family. She's right: if you don't think 2 years is that big of a deal, then you can deal with the inconvenience for 2 years.", "YTA. Your step children\u2019s education is not your financial concern. It is for their father to deal with alone. If he can\u2019t afford private school for his children on his salary alone, then it is them that should change schools. \n\nTrying to manipulate your daughter into  to sacrificing her education and happiness for your new family is frankly wrong, and an incredibly selfish ask from you. \n\nJust wait until your daughter asks to live with her father full time, and you have to pay child support, and your 1/2 of tuition too. And wait until your daughter wises up to your selfishness, and decides she no longer wants a relationship with you.", "YTA. Kelly is in a STEM focused private school yet you made a decision with her step-father to relocate her to a different school because it\u2019s more convenient for him and his children. Both you and him are total AH. I\u2019m glad that her father is on her side.\n\nKelly is 12. She should he a priority over everyone else in that family yet you\u2019re putting everyone else before her. Why didn\u2019t you relocate to be closer to her school? You\u2019ve had 7 years to figure that out. \n\nIMO Kelly should be with her dad on weekdays and you can get her on weekends since you\u2019re willing to jeopardize her STEM education.", "YTA\n\nDon't uproot her life any more than you already have.\n\nIf the step kids go to school in town, there must be busses they could take or friends they could ride with. Or you can easily drop them off while dropping her off. They are old enough to sit in a cafe alone or do homework for awhile at a friend's house near their school. Think outside the box. \n\nYou cannot convince me, given that you are paying private school tuition for her that there are not solutions you won't consider.\n\nI feel like there is something else going on here.\n\nEspecially if you previously could afford a driver for her.\n\nEdited to add this: I ALREADY SAW YOUR EDITS AND EXCUSES!", "YTA - I spent a lot of time reading your responses to the comments.\n\nIf you truly loved your daughter, you would drop the petty divorce crap and let her stay with your husband during the week. \n\nIf you think that doing this is \"losing to your ex\" Then you have already lost because you clearly care more about yourself than your own daughter.", "YTA.\n\nAlso this isn't what's best for her, this is what is best for you so it's not a great look like you're doing this for her. You're not, you're doing this to make things easier for yourself.\n\nAt this point I'd drop it, she clearly doesn't want to switch and you're not going to get her Dad on board as a result. Take this as a loss and figure out another solution.", "YTA. As others have said this isn\u2019t about what\u2019s best for Kelly it\u2019s about what\u2019s best for you and that is incredibly selfish. She\u2019s been at this school for YEARS, has friends there, and it is probably setting her up to have a really successful career in stem and now just because it\u2019s easier for you to not have to drive her 45 minutes away you want to take all of that away from her? You need to figure out a way to keep getting her to that school because THAT is what\u2019s best for her not ripping her away from her friends and the program she loves. If there\u2019s no one else who can drive her to school and you can\u2019t get her step siblings even a used car then find someone who can drive your step siblings to their school or figure out some sort of public transportation, or even get them bikes if it\u2019s too far to walk. There are plenty of other solutions rather than forcing your daughter to leave her school just because it\u2019s easier for you.", "YTA.  \n\nI can think of a handful of simple solutions off the top of my head.  A beater car they drive to school together.  Dropping them at a friend's house nearby on your way to drop your daughter.  Put the older kids in an uber, or another car service.  Putting up with it for two years.\n\nI know you have excuses for all of these.  Set the \"it's impossible\" attitude aside and just get it done.  This is what parenthood is.  This is the job.\n\nIf you put your child, who loves her school, last on your list you are TA indeed.", "YTA. You are putting Kelly's education in jeopardy if you relocate her to the other school. Especially that you are not getting any approvals from Kelly's father. If he says no, it's a complete sentence. You had some time to figure things out with the transportation. You are choosing to deny Kelly's goals over your stepchildren's.", " Absolutely YTA. Either you suck it up and drive her for two years, or she lives with her Dad so she can go.  Her education and social life is a priority. This is what a good parent does. I spent years driving my three kids to different schools and activities. You just need to make it work.", "YTA as someone who went to a STEM school it is very much a big deal. The opportunity I was given from attending a school like that was something I was truly grateful for, knowing I given that chance. You may think it\u2019s unfair for your daughter not to give up her school but you have to realize that she is also only 12 years old, your daughter has been in that school for a very long time, which means she has built a community, friends, programs that she\u2019s interested in and she actually loves it. A lot has changed for her at such a young age and you\u2019re asking her to give up even more.\n\nOP Knowing how much your daughter loves and values her school, did your husband and yourself not think of this before hand? Actually sit down to think of the logistics of moving your step kids away from their neighborhood that is close to their school, to your child being driven to school and other activities? These are also things that should\u2019ve been figured out during your blending process.\n\nI will say forcing this issue will only cause resentment from your bio child regarding you and your new family.", "Info - what was your husband doing before he met you?\n\nSo he lived closer. Was this not figured out beforehand? Kids are 16/17, you couldn\u2019t wait two years to move in?", "YTA Stop trying to force her to do something she clearly doesn't want to do because it's at your inconvenience", "YTA. Great way to show your kid who is more important.", "YTA. I was a private school kid and would have never forgiven my mom if she had forced me to switch schools for her own convenience. I picked my school because of the computer science courses they offered and the Academic Decathlon program, both of which were some of my best memories in high school. Your daughter will probably make wonderful memories and have tons of unique opportunities at her STEM school. As a parent, you should be trying to give your daughter as many opportunities to succeed as possible.\n\nYou need to either let your ex have your daughter during the week so he can take her to school, or tell your husband to take care of getting his own kids to school. Can he start work later in the day and take them himself? If it's truly not possible, can his kids go to public school? If your answer is \"absolutely not\" because you don't want to pull them away from their friends and opportunities at the current school, consider why you want to do that for your own daughter.\n\nDo NOT take something away from your daughter due to your husband and his kids.

Why not get married after two years?  Pretty crappy parenting, it sounds selfish and all about what you want to make you new family happy. You should have left your new guy with his kids to live closer to their school until they're completed, then gotten married when life would be the same for your kid.", "Maybe your daughter can live at bio dad's on weekdays for school instead so he can take her to school and pick her up? And she can spend weekends at yours instead?\n\nLife is hard when you have to move and make new friends. And to also have an unstable family situation as well. It's understandable that stability and friendship are important to your daughter. Rebuilding a social network can be difficult. I'm glad her bio dad is on her side and prioritizes her happiness.\n\nIt sounds a bit like you might prioritize your new family over your daughter. Maybe it will be better if daughter lives with bio dad instead on weekdays. \n\nMy 2 cents. (Slight YTA.

No bus? School closed? Then I got dropped off and just had to wait outside until the school opened. That was common practice. Lots of kids standing outside before the school opened because it worked with their parents schedule. \n\nI empathize with you. You have a lot on your plate and are trying to make things work but wanting your daughter to move schools is NOT in her best interest but yours. I agree with another commenter: you have a child who loves going to school and you are gonna take that away from her.", "So he lived closer. Was this not figured out beforehand?

This isn't just a kid being upset about potentially leaving her friends, it could affect her future opportunities too.\n\nBut based on your custody agreement, it doesn't really matter what reddit thinks. If you try and pester your daughter to change schools, she's likely to just dig her heels in harder.

She was 3 when we split. We have a court order that we have to share the cost of her education (through her graduating high school) and we have a 2 yes, 1 no policy. We did this as we always intended for her to attend private schools, which is quite the investment. Plus, she\u2019s both of our kid. Kelly\u2019s been a private school that focuses in STEM. It\u2019s K-12, so she\u2019s been there since kindergarten. She loves it. The only issue has been it\u2019s a bit of a drive (45 minutes) and they don\u2019t have busses. We\u2019ve tried to find carpool situations but the only person from the school in our area moved a few years ago. No relatives nearby to help. We tried hiring someone to drive her but they weren\u2019t reliable. Still, it\u2019s been worth the sacrifice. \n\nImportant note, Kelly lives with me during the week and sees her dad on the weekends. I am the one who brings her to and from school. \n\nLast year, I remarried. My husband brought 2 children into the relationship. They\u2019re 16 & 17. Both attend a private school in town. Similar issue with no bussing, we also don\u2019t have their own cars as we can\u2019t afford that. My husband is a widower, so he\u2019s their only parent. He starts work at 6 am, so it\u2019s up to me to get the kids to school every day. It has been a bit of a mess trying to get everyone there on time. My step-children\u2019s private school doesn\u2019t have before or after school programs and starts after Kelly\u2019s. It\u2019s a tight squeeze to get her there, then get back to their school. \n\nAfter much discussion, my husband and I decided it\u2019d be for the best for Kelly to start at her step-siblings\u2019 school. We talked to my ex about it and he was very hesitant but said if Kelly wanted it, he\u2019d be on board.\n\nKelly doesn\u2019t want to. This school doesn\u2019t have a STEM program. She doesn\u2019t want to leave her friends. She asked why her step-siblings don\u2019t have to move to her school and I said it\u2019s because it\u2019s more than my husband can afford. I\u2019d chip in, but I can\u2019t afford to pay 2.5 tuitions (the half being what I pay for hers). Plus, they aren\u2019t into STEM or science, which is what the school heavily focuses on.\n\nKelly is refusing to go. I\u2019ve tried talking to her, bribing her, etc. She isn\u2019t budging. Therefore, neither is her dad. It\u2019s frustrating and I\u2019ve voiced that. I even tried the compromise that it\u2019d just be until her step-siblings graduated (2 years!!) and she said, then I can easily put up with this for 2 years.\n\nNow she\u2019s been at her dad\u2019s and says she\u2019s not coming home until I drop the matter. I said I want to talk about it more but she refuses. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
