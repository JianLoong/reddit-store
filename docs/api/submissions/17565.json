He texted me throughout the day that he wanted to cook and we discussed recipes but he never mentioned he would need more ingredients or anything. I just spent a lot of my money on groceries and I told I\u2019m I was worried about bills and to just use the peppers we have at home. After I said that my boyfriend wouldn\u2019t talk to me the rest of the phone call and when I got home I was met with lots of attitude. My boyfriend was saying how important it was to get that specific pepper and me not getting it ..according to him means I don\u2019t care about him and I no longer support him in his cooking and what he likes to do. \n\nI offered to help my boyfriend cook and he declined and after he was making it into a huge deal I offered to just buy it with my rent money (that\u2019s the only money I had left) and he declined that too. He then stormed out and bought the pepper with some quarters he had and made it a point that he had to use quarters to buy the pepper which apparently was another issue for him. All of yesterday he was going on being mean and saying things to belittle me. The way he is acting is like I did something so horrible against him and our relationship when I just suggested to use what we already have at home. Last night he was yelling at me when I was already upset about how he was treating me. \n\nI thought it was something very small and not a reason to act that dramatic over but he won\u2019t let it down. The way he is treating me is like I cheated or did something so horrific to him. And when I told him he is being way over dramatic and there is no reason to treat me that way over something like that he told me I\u2019m invalidating his feelings and just said things to make me feel more horrible. Like if he didn\u2019t get something I asked for I would never treat him that way because it\u2019s not that huge of a deal and I wouldn\u2019t treat him like shit over it like he is doing to me\u2026 or am I wrong for thinking that?", "created_utc": 1684412013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kxe2u/aita_for_not_picking_up_an_ingredient_from_the/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are both making a big deal out of something so small. This relationship is not going to last", "INFO: what kind of pepper did he request, for what dish, and what type of peppers did you have at home?", "NTA - I\u2019ve been there with money where yes, a small thing would mess up the bills/gas needed to get to point A and point B. It was so bad that I\u2019d calculated mileage and gas and planned for the fluctuation of cents and stopped using AC in summer or heat in winter because every penny was counted. Every stop was planned because if I ended with .05 cents in my account it was a good day. \n\nSo I can see how, stressed and not wanting to stop/detour, \u201cwe just got peppers\u201d means \u201cno, I can\u2019t stop and get that. You know how I feel about x finances\u201d. \n\nNotice he knows you\u2019re stressed about money and doesn\u2019t offer to pay for the pepper? Transfer you money? \n\n\nIf it had been me, I\u2019d be disappointed and frustrated, and I\u2019d either go get it myself if it was critical or I would reroute my cooking plan. It\u2019s not the end of the world. \n\nHis reaction is over the top. His anger is over the top. His silent treatment is too much.

You are confused. \n\nThis is the time to get your essentials together and plan to leave because it will not get better. He will improve if you threaten to leave, but for a while. This is surmountable, you can leave, you can start over.", "So... there are two ways to read this as far as I'm concerned, and it depends on which read is correct to determine whether or not you are TA.\n\n1. Your boyfriend is completely overreacting and throwing this whole thing out of proportion because he wants to break up with you but he doesn't want to do the breaking up.  He wants you to break up with him so that he can be the victim.  If this is the case, you would not be TA.\n2. You have a habit of disregarding your boyfriend's wishes or belittling him or invalidating him in ways that you may or may not realize that you're doing it.  Maybe he's brought it up and you ignored it because you didn't think it a big deal (and you wouldn't accept that it was a big deal TO HIM).  Maybe he never brought it up and let it build and build until he hit his breaking point.  If this is the case, you would be TA.\n\nMy advice would be to have a serious conversation where the two of you REALLY talk about the important things and, more importantly, you take some time and really listen to your bf, and even if you don't view a situation that way, understand that HE DOES, and maybe put your own ego aside and understand that you might be wrong here.", "This feels kind of ESH. He is super over reacting, red flag territory here, but for fucks sake how much is a pepper? \n\nInfo: does he work? how often do you tell him that there is no room in the budget for what he is looking to do? what was he cooking that could only use one specific pepper?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you were having a conversation, he asked for something (the pepper), you provided an alternative (use what we have) and he didn\u2019t push back or explain why the ones at home wouldn\u2019t do (unless you have a typo in there and meant to say that he \u2018didn\u2019t\u2019 talk to you for the rest of the call?

If this pepper situation is the only instance then he\u2019s way over the top. I suspect there is much more going on for him either inside or outside the relationship. Either way, you should not accept being treated like this. \n\nI\u2019d say talk it through and work out what the actual issue is. If you can have a respectful conversation and it\u2019s something you can work on together, great.
