Lucy(19F) and Bill(23M). Lucy is a bit of a hot head and always complains about everything. Starting from the age of 16 we started leaving her at home for family vacations. This is because she would start complaining as soon as we start the booking process. She\u2019s always picky about food and will only go out to eat if it\u2019s a place she likes. As a result she gets left at home half the time when we go out to eat. \n\nBefore she left for college, she had a falling out with her highschool friends. Now that she\u2019s back for break, she was upset because she had a falling out with her new college friends as well. \n\nThis thanksgiving, I invited over her boyfriend and my son\u2019s girlfriend. Lucy proceeded to offer snide remarks about everyone\u2019s cooking while forcing her own dish onto everyone\u2019s plates. Her boyfriend looked visibly upset and uncomfortable and has broke up with her some time after the thanksgiving. \n\nShe came to us crying about how her friends left her and now she got dumped. I was already kind of upset with her over how she handled thanksgiving dinner. I told her that she\u2019s the reason people leave her and that nobody wants to be around someone that just complains all day. I told her that I felt bad for her bf who was just trying to be as respectful as possible. \n\nNow she\u2019s been crying in her room for a while and my wife thinks I was unnecessarily mean to her. I told her that I was done with her just dissing everything in sight and she needs to know she\u2019s the reason for her relationships failing. \n\nAITA for telling her she is the reason people don\u2019t want to be around her?", "created_utc": 1701048054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184qskc/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_shes_the_reason/", "score": 3696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How did you get to the point of her staying home for family dinners and vacations? Did you have a  conversation where you told her why she couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t go? Did you just tell her she was staying home? How is this the first time she\u2019s finally hearing this?", "INFO: When did her behavioral problems start, and what did you do about them besides leaving her out of things?", "Welp, if you were willing to leave your daughter at home at age 16, I'm gonna bet that you stopped trying to parent her a fair while before that. When kids have social and communication problems, which she clearly has, you help them change that  or get them help if you aren't able to, so YTA. Yeah, she causes things to happen, but you seem to have done nothing to help with this behavior and are just rubbing it in her face to avoid it being a natural outcropping of your dismissive and non-proactive attitude toward parenting when she was younger. Could you have helped for sure? Nope, nothing is certain, but this kind of extreme self defeating behavior comes from somewhere, and I bet a therapist could have helped her sort some things out.", "\nMy question is this: Why did you wait 19 years to start parenting your daughter?\n\nHere\u2019s why: You\u2019ve invited her on multiple vacations, and it sounds like she\u2019s complained about each and every one. I\u2019d like to point out that many people are unable to go on vacations, for financial or medical reasons. She didn\u2019t even give some of these vacations a chance. She refuses to eat anywhere that isn\u2019t on her list of approved restaurants. It doesn\u2019t sound like she has any neurological or sensory processing disorders, or dietary restrictions that can\u2019t be accommodated by an alternate restaurant. She had a falling out with her friends in high school. If that was just a one-off, it might not have been her fault. But factor in the falling out with college friends, and it seems that she might be the culprit to a failed friendship. She behaved more like a toddler at Thanksgiving than an adult. Judging by her behavior after being dumped, she has absolutely no coping skills.\n\nYTA. Not for saying what you said, but for waiting nearly two decades to start parenting.\n\nEdit 1: One of the reasons I make explicit assumptions is because it allows OP to better see my train of thought, and correct any incorrect assumptions. \n\nEdit 2: In another comment OP mentions that his daughter has been diagnosed with ADHD which can cause emotional disregulation, resistance to change, and sensory issues. Given this information, my judgement does not change, but my reasonings somewhat do. OP has still failed to parent, IMO. In this case, a parent not capable of providing emotional support and tools for regulation, coping, and self-expression should do their best to connect their child to a provider who can teach them these skills. \nOP also says that Lucy is on a low-dose medication. Speaking from personal experience, and the experience of my sibling, ADHD medication does not always work, or doesn\u2019t work wholly (In my brothers case, it calmed his outward symptoms, but didn\u2019t help with the anxiety, resistance to change, or emotional disregulation). In my case, it had the opposite effect of what was intended. \n\nMy judgement stands, and OP is free to correct any incorrect assumptions.", "NTA for telling your daughter she\u2019s the problem. YTA for not solving the problem when she was younger and instead going the easy route by leaving her behind instead of being a parent and correcting her bad behavior.", "YTA. I don't think leaving her at home because she's annoying was the right way to address her behavior. Have you made any effort to figure out why she does the things she does? It sounds like it's more complex than just \"complaining,\" and excluding her from family vacations when she was a kid is a fucking awful way to parent your child.", "\u201cMy 16 year old became annoying so we abruptly started cutting her out of the family, now she\u2019s crying because I told her she\u2019s unlovable, AITA?\u201d", "INFO: OP, has your daughter been evaluated for a mental health or personality disorder? \n\nHer behavior isn\u2019t exactly alarming, but it is very telling that she makes everyone in her life uncomfortable.

There\u2019s no sense in everyone being miserable just because she is  \u2014 help her get the help she needs to be less miserable.\n\nYTA though for not thinking before you addressed the situation. That could have been handled a bit more delicately.", "I mean, so here's the thing.  She's the Least Common Denominator in all her relationships.  So she \\*should\\* be looking inward here.  However, you're also the parent and instead of talking this through with her over the years you just ditched her like everyone else.  Do better.  Go console her and give her a hug.", "NTA\n\nI have an older child who is like this. She's been in therapy for years, in and out of treatment centers, a half dozen medications, psychiatrist and psychologist. \n\nNothing has stuck. \n\nAt some point, I had to take a step back and enforce boundaries. \n\nIt was, for all intents and purposes, an abusive relationship. \n\nShe was raised in the same house, with the same rules and same schools - same everything as her siblings. \n\nHer siblings are happy, well adjusted and functional young adults. \n\nSometimes, it's something inside that makes them so unhappy with the world.

Nothing you said was helpful in anyway. Call me crazy but has anyone actually asked Lucy why she is so pessimistic about everything? Teenage angst is real & it comes from somewhere. Appears no one has addressed this issue before now? \n\nYou basically told Lucy the one place where she should feel safe & loved unconditionally is not safe & there are conditions. We left her home & went on vacation \u2026 why? You are the adults! Help her fix the problem! \n\nSorry but YTA \u2026 go talk to your daughter or let your wife handle it.\n\neta \u2014 or get her actual help.

It's been 3 days, I feel like you could narrow it down a bit.)\n\nIt strikes me as strange how willing you were to just not include her on things like dinner and vacation. I get being frustrated. But what did she do while the rest of you enjoyed your vacation? When you ate out? If you thought her negative attitude was a problem for her - and I'm not arguing this fact - the time to address it was years ago. \n\nAll that _plus_ the way you said it wasn't helpful. YTA", "She sounds like a menace. Who the fuck brought up this brat? Oh, right.\n\nYTA bro. Your reaction to your daughter acting up is abandonment and your guidance amounts to bullying. Who knows what else kind of fucked up shit is going on in your household that helped her become so chronically negative.", "While Lucy is technically an adult it sounds like most of her issues started as a teenager. Unless you gave her other tools to address her combativeness beyond leaving her at home do you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with her then YTA.", "YTA for not getting her the therapy she needed when she was younger and instead just left her at home when it was inconvenient to you.  \n\nSeems the apple didn't fall far from the tree.", "YTA it\u2019s so crazy to me that you\u2019re writing this post directly after your argument , while your daughter is still crying in her room! It\u2019s not normal to lose friend groups like that, she\u2019s probably not well adapted to keeping friends and being a pleasant person to be around, as you loved to bring up throughout your post. But if we\u2019re talking about your actions as a Father? You\u2019re absolutely the asshole. The main reason she is maladapted is because of parenting(which is fine, no parents are perfect) , but you choose to tell her some crushing truths in the rudest way possible instead of your priority being helping her improve as a person, and then you\u2019re going to the internet to post about your daughter to see if \u201cyou\u2019re the asshole\u201d.\n\nthe thing you should be focusing on is \u201chow can I help my daughter be able to form healthy long lasting relationships, that will then improve our family relationship too\u201d", "NTA for telling her this. Might be the asshole for not telling her this sooner.", "YTA, how do you expect someone who has her family literally give up on them before they are an adult to act? You aren\u2019t capable of raising children in a way that makes your life the easiest and therefore even though her frontal lobe isn\u2019t developed you took the easy way out.

She clearly has some emotional/mental health issues, and rather than try to get her help and support her through them, you\u2019ve just completely thrown in the towel.

YTA for not dealing with this when she was younger. I would suggest that she get in therapy to understand why she is always so negative. It's very hard to be around people like that.", "YTA. This has been going on for years, it's negatively impacted relationships in & outside the family. Why have you not stepped up and helped her by looking into professional resources?

You've brought her up to be the family scapegoat. She wants to be heard, and the more dismissive you are of her feelings, the more strident she becomes. Have you ever tried listening and talking her through the big feelings? Ever? Or do you take the easy way out and just leave her behind when she's too difficult for you to handle? I'd go as far as to say her staying at home is probably her holiday from you.\n\nMaybe it's *her* behaviour, but when it comes down to it you're the parent. YOU are the ultimate reason people don't want to be around her. Try listening to her for once.", "Esh you for not sorting this much earlier, your response was just to leave her home? P", "NTA for what you said but kinda one for letting it go on for this long before saying something to her", "NTA for being honest about why she is the problem. YTA big time for only bringing it up when shes' hit rock bottom. First year of university is a hug transition and was an incredibly lonely time for me. She was probably really excited about coming back to spend time with her family and friends. For a relationship she must've relied on to end after losing both her college and highschool friends, you only affirmed the worst for her when the wounds were fresh.\n\nYou should have waited until she was mentally more stable and had a kinder approach about droping the bomb. I.E: suggesting that she open up her mind to her preferences when making new friends. You're also the asshole for taking out some of your personal resentment against her. You should have said this bc you care for her and want her to make long lasting friendships, not bc you're sick of her attitude.", "I\u2019m torn because you probably had no idea what to do and had no idea how this part of her personality would progress. Parenting is just one crazy experiment after the next. \n\nMy daughter is 8 but is exactly the same way. I\u2019ve sometimes said that as a family we all had PPD that\u2019s never gone away. We are working on getting her evaluated because I feel like this all may be part of a larger mental health concern. She picks fights constantly and hates most things and is our little grumpy girl but I couldn\u2019t imagine just giving up and just not taking her with us. Not now or ever. Her whole self is part of the family, even when she is difficult and demanding and volatile. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I think seeing a therapist would help. For the whole family collectively and for her individually.", "Dude, you should have told her that years ago when the complaining started. No, you are not the AH for saying it now.", "NTA. You're the parent and some of the tough choices you have to make include breaking tough news like this to your kids. The truth hurts and it's better she learns it now than further down the line. She's reaping what she sows. Let's hope she learns from this.\n\nYou should've put her in her place long before this past thanksgiving dinner though. You allowed it to fester.", "Wow she seems like a miserable person who takes that out on everyone around her, I would go get her psychologically evaluated. She might actually have something going on with her mental health. I\u2019m sorry to you, as well as her bc that\u2019s a sad way to live for the both of you.", "NTA. How is it she has never learned to consider how other people feel? She needed to hear this years ago. Friends must have mentioned it to her on their way out.", "ESH but leaning on NTA.

Likely you wanted to yell at her all the time, nobody actually talked to her and worked her through these things when she was growing up. Instead you abandon her and leave her likely with so many insecurities that she\u2019s trying to get some sense of control in her life, but overreaches because she probably is having a panic attack all the time. \n\nAnd then you insult her. You don\u2019t try and offer support or show any positive way of working through this.

If it started when she was 16, what\u2019s the trigger?\n\nIMO, excluding her is only making things worse. And by letting it go on this long, you\u2019ve made it even worse. \n\nGetting help for her will probably be very difficult now.

TOTALLY just me faking it to get drugs. WTF kind of drugs would they even give me for that anyway.\n\nBut, no, yeah, it's all totally because I have BPD and therefore cannot be trusted no matter how many times my PCP has said \"Dude, she's fucking sick\".", "Woo! I'm not alone, BPD, PTSD, depression, anxiety and autism", "I have BPD and it's frustrating when people characterize it as 'crazy woman disorder' like they see something on the news about a crazy ex girlfriend and immediately everyone jumps to BPD. Or someone is acting in a manner more associated with NPD or ASPD or even HPD but is written off as BPD.\n\nI have had to explain so many times that BPD is not when someone lacks empathy, it's when they feel too much and then their brain implodes from it.\n\nLike, most normal humans have, say, a really thick shield around the parts of the brain that deal with emotion and this shield allows them to experience emotion and recieve emotional stimuli and deal with other people's emotions without going haywire. Someone with with BPD lacks that shield and so every time an emotion hits there is no buffer. You're feeling it at full intensity. It's like a raw wound. Your brain then floods you with stress and fear hormones and then your reactions become much, much bigger, more intense, and more unhealthy than a normal person's. The crux of helping manage BPD is learning emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal communication. All of which contribute to the brain shield I mentioned earlier. So someone with BPD isn't born with that brain shield which is why they react so extremely or assume certain things or what have you and thus must work to actually make that brain shield themselves with a therapist. It's kind of like if you have a hot stove and burn yourself on it. You have an automatic reaction to the pain and to want the pain gone ASAP. Same with BPD, except the pain is emotional and it's *all the fucking time.*\n\nAlso everyone claims BPD makes someone super manipulative and it's rather annoying because I get it, if you get into an arguement with someone and the person responds \"okay okay I'm sorry I'm really sorry you're right and I'm wrong and I'm always wrong and bad and you're always good and right sorry I really shouldn't have argued with you sorry\" yes, it does sound manipulative. And while I've been able to avoid this behavior after years of treatment, I can also say that when I *did* respond like that, I actually fucking meant every word. I actually believed that. \n\nAnd I definitely can trace it right back to a certain parent of mine's behavior themselves.\n\nBut the disorder is highly misunderstood and it sucks because then a bunch of people don't get the help they really really need.\n\nI feel bad for this girl.
