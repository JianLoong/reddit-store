I mean, the kids may as well live with you full time. Golfing 5 days a week?She's being selfish. She chose to have those 2 kids, she needs to step up and take care of her own children instead of pawning them off on you constantly. It's not fair to you, the kids, her husband or your husband.", "NTA. You're right in everything you said to her and it was a long time coming. She's not talking to you anymore, but I'm sure she'll try to contact you like nothing happened and have you watch the kids again. Stay strong and keep saying no. You have your own mental health and your own marriage to worry about. \n\nAlso, in future, please do not devalue yourself so much. You don't have to beg for money from someone who is using you for labor. Where I live, you can get $15-$30 an hour for babysitting two kids. And if someone is golfing all the time, the definitely have money.

They are her kids, you don't owe her anything. Don't watch the kids anymore and don't feel guilty. They are your mother's responsibility, not yours.", "NTA this is a manipulation tactic.  She\u2019s trying to black mail you by denying you visits to your siblings unless you agree to watch the kids.  She can afford a vacation but she can\u2019t afford to provide money for her children\u2019s food?! That means she can\u2019t actually afford a vacation.  If you give into to her demands and look after her children at your own expense so that she can go on a vacation then where will it end? At what point will you have the right to say no to her demands? She\u2019s cutting you of for refusing but the alternative is giving in and having to be willing to Sacrifice your time money and energy at her whim for the rest of your life. Is that really a better way to live than what she\u2019s doing now?  Make sure your siblings know you love them and they can call you anytime but you will not be manipulated into raising them so that she can steal your youth from you.  I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s pulled this whole \u201cI\u2019ll cut you off unless you let do whatever I want whenever I want it\u201d. That\u2019s not love and you\u2019ll never be able to do enough to earn her appreciation and make her realize that you deserve some respect.  It sucks but you really need to stay strong and refuse to baby sit anymore.  Some time away from her might help you clear your head and decide what you will and will not accept going forward", "NTA. You aren\u2019t *obligated* to provide ANYONE with FREE childcare, regardless if they are family or not. Your mom is \u201cliving her best life\u201d at the expense of your own.

My mom had me at 17, then had my half brothers when I was like 20-24. \n\nI never met them bc the stepdad moved a lot for work and i was a poor college student. \n\nOne day out of the blue my mom calls and says she has t had a vacation in years, doesn\u2019t know anyone she\u2019s trusts for the boys, and would I come to her state for like $500 and an iPod. The iPod was just new at the time and she lived in a McMansion. I jumped at the chance to meet my brothers AND get swag.\n\nI got there, they left, I tried to vacuum and my brother had a meltdown. He\u2019s autistic and she never once mentioned it. He punched me in the face and flushed my weddings rings (turned out to it be true, he stole the rings but for a week I thought he flushed them). \n\nI was livid. They tried to use their wealth like, who cares about your tiny diamond ring we\u2019ll buy you something better! Then when that didn\u2019t work it was \u201chow could I be so mean to my brothers\u201d. Then it was \u201chow dare I send a swear word in an email to step dads phone when corporate doesn\u2019t know he took his phone out of the country\u201d! LOL bro, if corporate didn\u2019t know how did I know that was a thing? \n\nNeedles to say they flew home on their original date and I was waiting at the door bags backed. I took their cab to the airport and never saw them again. \n\nShe didn\u2019t care about my brother having a meltdown for two weeks because she neglected to tell me he was special needs. I had to call every pediatrician and get a crash course in autism over the phone while he threw shit at me and damaged the house and my little brother was hiding in his room crying. Even at like 5 you could tell the youngest was parentified so hard bc the second the oldest was asleep he was \u201ccooking dinner\u201d by opening frozen chicken nuggets and putting them in the microwave AND SETTING THE TABLE! \n\nEven at like 20-something, and no kids of my own, I knew that was deeply fucked up.\n\n All my mom complained about was how I endangered her husbands job with a sweary email and what do I care anywhere I got an IPod.\n\n\nUgh, your kids? That\u2019s why!", "NTA \n\nYour mom sounds pretty selfish. Those are her kids. She decided to start over, that does not mean you need to give up your youth to raise them.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom needed to hear the truth that her actions are affecting everyone. She's prioritizing herself to the point it's negatively impacting her marriage, her children, and your marriage. Like you said OP, she's probably going through a midlife crisis because she missed her prime years when she had to raise you, but she decided to have you and her responsibility as a parent is to raise you. Now that she's had 2 more children, it's still her responsibility as a parent to raise them, not you and it's caused you to miss out on some of your prime years too and lose friendships along the way. \n\nIf your mom contacts you OP, please set boundaries with her that she cannot just keep pawning her children off to you to watch. That you will only watch them if you have agreed to it, and that you expect compensation for your time watching them. \n\nAlso question OP, your mom is out golfing 5 days a week, most likely for hours on end and it seems like she has little interaction with her kids during the week, except maybe on the weekends, do they still acknowledge her as their mother (like do they ask about her or wonder where she is)? The seem like they're 6 and 3 from your post.", "Thank you. That\u2019s how I\u2019m starting to feel and what I\u2019m starting to think but I know I owe that woman my life and I just feel bad for what I said to her.

But you also can\u2019t control her reaction - you can only control your own actions. How she chooses to react to your completely reasonable actions is on her, not you.", "Sadly she doesn\u2019t seem that concerned about upsetting you. Or her husband or kids for that matter.", "It's ok to upset people when they try to take over your life to make things more convenient for them. Mom needs to devote some time to the kids instead of playing golf all the time.", "I know im making leaps of judgement but this is the leaps of judgement subreddit. I think you're NTA. But also the fact that this is causing tension in her marriage and she's still going on a week long trip is fishy to me.", "Thank you!"]}
