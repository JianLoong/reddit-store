I had to call every pediatrician and get a crash course in autism over the phone while he threw shit at me and damaged the house and my little brother was hiding in his room crying. Even at like 5 you could tell the youngest was parentified so hard bc the second the oldest was asleep he was \u201ccooking dinner\u201d by opening frozen chicken nuggets and putting them in the microwave AND SETTING THE TABLE! \n\nEven at like 20-something, and no kids of my own, I knew that was deeply fucked up.\n\n All my mom complained about was how I endangered her husbands job with a sweary email and what do I care anywhere I got an IPod.\n\n\nUgh, your kids?

People don't have endless patience.", "She can afford to play golf 5 days a week but refused when you asked for a contribution for food shopping when you have the kids for a week during her golf vacation?   Wow.  You don\u2019t need to feel bad at all about refusing to be used", "Ok I didn't even read after I heard that you are dealing with mental health issues. Why TF would your mother put this in you when you are already struggling? That's not fair to you, or the kids. I have a nice trifecta of Anxiety, Bi-Polar Disorder, and Depression, and on a bad day I wouldn't be able to care for an air plant, much less two humans. NTA", "NTA.  Your mother is awful.", "NTA I'm sorry that you've reached that point. I imagine it wasn't an easy decision to make as you feel for your young siblings. However, one thing I learned in therapy is that sometimes, you have to take care of yourself first, before you can help anyone else. \n\nPlus, you're correct. She needs to take care of her children and make other arrangements that don't include you. Her lack of care is detrimental to all her children.", "NTA -- It sounds to me as though you said exactly what needed saying.", "Stay strong Op. You are NTA.\n\nSome parents learn ways to manipulate their children that lasts into Adulthood. You have been taught a History where your mom is your Savior and that you 'OWE\" her. That is not healthy . You do NOT owe her your time and life which by your own acct. she's beens taking  away. Stay strong and see how much better you like life when you are in control of your time.", "NTA. Good that you stood up for yourself. Also sounds like your mom is having a an affair", "NTA. Golf is a pretty expensive hobby yet she doesn\u2019t have enough money to give you to help feed the kids?", "I don\u2019t get it. You should be living your own life. Not even a question.", "NTA.\n\nShe can't afford to pay you but can pay green's fees to play golf several days a week?", "Why can she afford golf (expensive hobby) but not childcare? NTA.", "NTA - can afford a holiday but can't pay you a few hundred dollars to feed her own children that she's dumping on you. \n\nThe children also have a father who I assume is capable of caring for them. Why is he not stepping up? Ludicrous. \n\nShe'll continue to use and abuse you until you put your foot down.", "NTA. You said what needed to be said. Now don\u2019t back pedal. Do not watch the kids anymore.", "NTA\n...do you want a hug?", "NTA. Your mother can't afford to go on a week-long golf trip with her friends but she can't afford to help you buy groceries for her own children? She needs to get herself together.", "While originally, I\u2019d agree with you, she is also hurting her husband with her behaviours (who works unbelievably long hours to pay for their house and the children and even her) and is available in the evenings. He\u2019s not to be at fault here at all, he does what he can when he can and he\u2019s very apologetic to me and feels awful for all of this. I\u2019ve had the children 5 days in the past week, was due to have them again tomorrow. We have tried to all sit her down and express that we are worried about her because this recent behaviour is completely out of the ordinary for her.", "He does take care of them when he is home and able to do so. I couldn\u2019t fault him at all.", "I have stated this in the comments, but incase you missed it. He works very long hours during the week, and he always has done. This was agreed upon and has always been the case with my mum. He takes care of them whenever he can. As soo as he\u2019s home from working atleast 12 hours per day he cooks dinner for them and handles them and he\u2019s just so extremely tired and beaten because he usually has his wife there doing it with him and now she\u2019s withdrawn from him completely also. He feels as though he\u2019s having to try and keep his marriage afloat while working and then having the responsibility of the children when he\u2019s not working. He gets absolutely no chill time what so ever.", "NTA\n\nSorry OP but strongly disagree.  No one asked you if you wanted to be born obviously so her decision to have a child (you) comes with the reasonable expectation she take the actions necessary to support that decision. \n\nNow she\u2019s had more children and had been dumping her responsibilities to be a mother on you.  \n\nNope. \n\nYou were correct to call her on it.  She can rely on her spouse and/or hire a nanny.  You are not her mommy stand in. \n\nIf you would like to visit your siblings I\u2019d suggest reaching out to your stepfather if your mother will not communicate with you.  \n\nIf told no by both then you may have to wait to reconnect with them until they are older.", "No one owes their parent(s) their life, you do not owe her yours. She chose to bring you into this world, and she was obligated to care for you because of that choice. While you can be grateful, you do not owe her anything just for being born or raised", "You don't owe her your life. She is your mother and supposed to take care of you. Instead she had you looking after her younger children when you were young. Now she is putting her children over your marriage and your time. She is not even paying you. She has been taking advantage of you.", "You are giving her too much credit. You should not place too much emphasis on her opinions because she\u2019s been very entitled to your help and probably will continue to be. You\u2019ve been a bit of a doormat for her and have not sufficiently prioritized your own interests up til now. You don\u2019t owe her your life and I hope that you\u2019ll get some help with your mental health so you can understand that. If nothing else, your spouse deserves to have you on their side rather than always putting your mom first.", "You don't owe her anything in fact she owed you a good life and didn't seem to provide or attempt to provide that to you.", "Stop thinking that way. She had sex. You were the result. She was legally obligated to take care of you once she had you and kept you. Those were her choices that she made. You don't owe her for that. You didn't *ask* to be born and don't take on a contractual obligation from being born. You owe her only in kind as she gave and gives you love and respect and support as able and within reason and boundaries.", "I think you have been misinformed or brainwashed by mom. Parents have a responsibility to the children that they chose to bring into this world. Children do not have the same responsibility to be a slave to their parents. Somehow you have it backwards. You don\u2019t owe her anything for birthing you.", "Your mom is being unreasonable, how can she afford a golfing trip and to go golfing each week when she can't afford to feed her own kids?\n\nGolfing isn't a cheap hobby,and if she is going that often is she at least working because if she's living off her husband...that would be entire other conversation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: we 100% sure she is golfing, right?", "While Mom is playing golf??? Think about this, She is using you.", "Is it dark by then?  Most leagues play once a week and end around 8 or 9\n\nThey also cost money.  Id see if there are grass stains or dirt on her tees.", "Please see a counselor.  Let them read this reddit post or your comments.\n\nYou are a people pleaser and you are parentified.\n\nYou should NOT blow off your friends for your mom unless it's an actual emergency...which is emergency room visits, emergency surgery...not \"teeing up\" to the 19th hole.", "At least one parent is being a parent. Good for him. You are entitled to your life, you want to travel and other things before you have kids\u2026 well how are you supposed to do that?", "Thank you, I missed this.", "It\u2019s still his job before it\u2019s yours.  His chill time is honestly irrelevant.  He has two kids too.", "And I understand people pleasing living in a household where you are the parent more than the actual parent tends to do that. You'll get more confident in saying no and it no longer hurting you to do that.", "This crossed my mind too. Mum can afford an expensive hobby like golfing 5 days a week and a golfing vacation but not food for her kids. Sounds suspect", "You are not responsible for a grown woman\u2019s feelings/emotions.  She chose to have you.  Parents are supposed to take care of their kids.  She didn\u2019t do you any favors.  You owe her nothing.\n\nGood for you for setting boundaries.  She needs to take care of her kids.  SHe had money to golf and go on week long trips but she doesn\u2019t have money to pay you or to give you to feed her kids??? Make it make sense. \n\nDo not allow her selfish behavior to continue ruin your mental health or your marriage.", "You didn't upset her, you inconvenienced her. She is using her children to manipulate you. Ask yourself what you are doing to your marriage. These children have a mother and a father. You are not their parent. Block her, she will try and crawl back soon enough but the answer needs to stay a firm 'No'. NTA", "She probably knows you get upset at upsetting the people you love ... and pushes your buttons because of it \u2639", "It\u2019s important to understand that you can love someone but they might not be healthy for you. Them being upset because they are being overly entitled doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s justified. Sometimes it\u2019s best to love people like this from a distance.", "Get over it, for your own good.. Getting upset isn't helping you live a happy life, and your mom is manipulating you. \n\nShe 100% contributes to your mental health issues. \n\nWork on yourself and let her bond with her children.", "One thought for you\u2014is it possible that your upbringing(by your mother!) caused you to feel so strongly responsible for your loved ones\u2019 emotions? Because it seems to me that you feel this responsibility more than most\u2026and more than is healthy for you. These feelings leave you vulnerable to manipulation.", "I understand that it may be upsetting, but from what you've described she is neglecting her children and that's not fair to your siblings, nor is it fair to you to have to play Mom for your siblings.  \n\nYour stepfather is an adult, and can fight his own battles regarding his relationship.  But he should also be putting his foot down too.", "Honestly, it doesn\u2019t sound like she cares about your feelings. Why should you care about hers? You didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t absolutely true, and you weren\u2019t insulting.\nYou are bending over backwards for someone who would never return the favour.", "Op should think of it this way: Mom's golf is not more important than OP's marriage.", "I used to work in the tennis world and saw this kind of thing more than people would think. People using their sport as their cover for their affair."]}
