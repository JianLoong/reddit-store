There are lots of classes you can take, probably including some online. \n\nFor rear facing car seats, you have to learn how to use your seat\u2019s angle indicator. For front and rear facing, you need to know how to use the LATCH lower anchors, and you need to know how to lock the seatbelt once kids reach 40 pounds (or 65 minus the weight of the seat). You also need to know how to use the upper LATCH tethers, and you need to know how to make everything tight. It doesn\u2019t apply to this scenario, but you also need to know that rear facing straps should be at or just below your child\u2019s shoulders and forward facing straps should be at or just above your child\u2019s shoulders. And no more than a 2 finger gap between buckle and baby once the child is buckled in. \n\nWhile that is a bit of a list, I was trained on all that when my oldest child was born 10 years ago. The only refresher course I had was installing the car seats a million times.

The seats can be removed, it's just a hassle.", "Googling told me ISOFIX involves solid metal connectors from the car seat, always fixed distance. With no lateral wiggle. LATCH uses soft tethers that you have to tighten, like I said already. Clicking in the buckles to the anchors is just step one before you remove the slack. It seems LATCH came first and the two are mostly compatible with each other, but not the same, like I said. \n\nYes you have to level the base. There is no guarantee that the seat automagically know the design and angle of your car seat cushions. You have to level it. And for infants, you also have to change the angle based on weight (e.g. under 7 pounds, between 7 and 22, and over 22 pounds).

They offer the solution to OP, and OP agrees. None of what is happening in any way applies to any laws you are familiar with. I'm going to be honest and say I don't know either, but u do know there are different laws in child care, and even in those cases they typically don't correlate to two individuals engaged in a transaction. \n\nFact is, unless they have something in writing, the likely hood that they can get the car back in the case of a separation is possible but not likely if the laws don't allow for it in your state, it's also possible OP doesn't want it in that case, and she's not harmed in any tangible way other than the income lost as part of the loan repayment. \n\nThere are anecdotes from other nannies in this post that aren't legal issues, but issues of what is considered normal practice. \n\nBut you also touched on commercial use, which you are wrong, unless, of course, she is transporting the kids in some way to make money off the kids.

Did I miss where family vacations are the exception to laws about car seats?", "NTA, it's your work car.\n\nTwo bits of advice, though.\n\nFirst, learn how to install them. \nTwo, can you afford two cars on a nanny salary? You really wanna check how taxes, insurance and all that jazz figures into your bottom line.", "NTA\n\nShe does not get to control what you do with your vehicle unless she's the one whose name it is in and she's paying all the expenses.", "nta. you made the right decision. I'm disappointed (and a little horrified tbh)  in your mom for pressuring you to prioritize her convenience over the safety of the kids you care for. yes, take some time to learn how to properly install the seats because moving or adjusting the seats may be an unavoidable issue in the future.", "NTA - you can\u2019t be coerced into doing something. Secondly can none of your family remove car seats?? This is essentially a work car and you are right to keep it like that.", "NTA.  This car had nothing to do with your mom.  Her anger at you for denying this request is unreasonable.\n\nBut...Your employers are also TA for insisting that someone else buy a car they don't need and will get limited use of.  If they can afford private child care they should provide a vehicle for the nanny's use at no cost to the nanny.\n\nI imagine your mom is irked that you are paying for it.  What will happen if you decide to quit?  Will the \"repossess\" your car?", "No, not at all.  The Ford Explorer is essentially your work vehicle.  You're absolutely right in that removing and re-installing the seats could be potentially catastrophic should you make a mistake and not re-install them correctly.  If your mother was so hell bent on taking just one car then why didn't she offer to rent a bigger vehicle for your Christmas gathering?  NTA.", "NTA.  \n\nBut your job is child care. You absolutely 100% need to know how to properly install those car seats confidently, how to spot when they\u2019re not properly installed and fix it, etc. You never know what could happen, as you said, and their lives depend on you knowing those seats inside and out. Please take the time to learn.", "NTA. installing 1 car seat is a pain let alone 4. I would also say no lol", "NAH.\n\nHonestly don\u2019t know why you\u2019re raising this in here. Nobody\u2019s an asshole in this situation. You aren\u2019t confident in installing a car seat so you don\u2019t want to do a thing; you mother thinks that looks like a perfectly straightforward thing to do and is frustrated that you won\u2019t look into doing it. The whole thing is just a basic human interaction, nobody\u2019s been an asshole. I think you could probably have taken the seats out for the Christmas thing, and find someone competent in fitting seats to put them back in for you when you\u2019re done. Clearly it\u2019s not something that you can do on the regular, but it doesn\u2019t seem impossible for it to happen on special occasions.", "NTA\n\nIt's like owning a business truck and a personal vehicle. You don't drive the work truck around to tote buddies in you use your personal car for that", "NTA kinda weird how she immediately tried to say you\u2019re being dramatic and the car was probably dirty. Your mom sounds like a real peach \ud83d\ude24\n\nBut you need to also learn how to install the car seats. In case of ANYTHING. What happens if you need to rent a car while yours is being repaired? Knowing car seat safety is the difference between life and death. \n\nPlease read some of the comments and see just how amazing car seats are. Children survive crashes that the parents don\u2019t. You sound like a really good nanny btw! You literally have a separate car seat vehicle for the kids \ud83e\udd7a That\u2019s actually super cute.", "I'm so confused why you don't just learn how to install the car seats. If you can't find an official manual and/or tutorial on the actual car seat models you're using (which should be online somewhere) then ask the parents for a crash course on it. Surely they'd be willing for the sake of their kids.\n\nThis should just be a nonissue. If this is your job and for the safety of these kids, you should learn how to do it...", "NTA but please learn how to fit the seat yourself in case you ever need to.\n\nAlso be wary of those with industry connections advising you only they can teach you or that you need to buy a safer seat etc.\n\nMajor manufacturers push these campaigns and groups and also try and push more expensive seats such as \"rear facing is safer\" when the peer reviewed data (the 2007 Henry study) was retracted as being unsafe to be relied on.", "You're a nanny and don't know how to install a car seat?\n\nI mean, you're NTA for this specific situation, but you seriously need to learn how to properly install a car seat.", "No way! This is your living. Car seats are a pain. If your mum wants a big car, you\u2019re not stopping her from buying one", "NTA. I\u2019m a CPST and know how to install my kids car seats, personally I wouldn\u2019t have uninstalled them for a thirty minute drive. They\u2019re work to get in and out and the amount of work isn\u2019t worth the whole idea of taking one car.", "NTA for this issue as your mother was being unreasonable and agressive. \n\nBut I'm confused about everybody saying it takes a lot of time to put on and remove car seats. My car is an older model (has reached majority) and has ISOFIX so car seats install is 2 minutes tops. Same for my folks far newer model. \n\nThe most difficult to install would be the 9mo if it's rearfacing, and I wouldn't advise to remove it at all. But the others? You really need to learn how to do them!", "NTA\n\nI think you need to check if the family that you provide Nanny services for can legally take payment for the vehicle. They should be supplying the vehicle in my opinion which is not that of a lawyer.", "Don't know why so many people assume that the OP is never planning on learning how to install the seats or that she's incompetent and helpless. I wouldn't want to deal with that bullshit right before a family vacation either. Also, the parents should have shown her already.", "NTA.  Your mom sounds spoiled. like everyone always does what she wants.  No is a word that sometimes has to be told to parents also.", "YTA If your too incompetent to take on the challenge of installing and uninstalling a car seat then you are too incompetent to be responsible for the lives of 4 kids. This isn't an oil change, car seats need to be designed with the absolute common denominator parent in mind exactly because childrens lives are at stake.  I'm not saying it's not a pain and in most cases it's not worth removing, but for a family event, once or twice a year, when you have the car that solves the problems but aren't willing to utilize it, yta. It's your car. You should have done exactly what your mother said, and then told the parents what you did and request that they take a look to make sure you did it right. You would then not only have the skill, but you would be in a better position to understand how those seats work and identify if they ever become loose or tampered with / compromised. That would make the children safer and the parents would be grateful.", "I agree that OP should know how to remove and reinstall them. Once she knows how much of a pain it can be, she will for sure not want to remove and install three car seats in order for them to all travel together in once car.", "If Mom wanted to use OP's car so badly she could have taken out and reinstalled the car seats herself. As a mother, ostensibly she's already done this before. \n\nOP sounds like a responsible employee to me. She's not convinced she could get the seats back in properly so she's not taking that chance by removing them. \n\nI think it was fair of Mom to ask, but also fair of OP to say no.", "You're actually insane if you think the minor inconvenience of driving 2 cars instead of 1 makes op an asshole. Your entitlement is mind blowing.", "Phew, I\u2019m glad someone else picked this point out too. Never mind the AITA issue, the biggest AH here are the employers taking obscene advantage of OP. She\u2019s paying for working equipment. I hope she\u2019s claiming it all on her taxes!", "As a mother of also 4, this is totally weird. I just know from experience that the nanny uses your car. Period. Otherwise don't ask the nanny to drive the kids around.", "I hope they pay for gas", "No, she's allowed to do whatever she wants with the car, she just needs to be able to be available to ferry the kids around while she is on the clock, which doesn't seem unreasonable for the course of work of a nanny. She is making her own car unusable by not learning how to do a basic task.", "Why is it any of your business? And secondly, I\u2019m sure she can find good use for an SUV after the job ends. What a weirdo", ">Installing car seats correctly is not easy\n\nThis is crazy to me. Just run the seatbelt through where the seatbelt goes and anchor it.

Had to replace the two car seats when it was very obvious that nothing was wrong with them. \n\nI don't even like buckling my niece/nephew up on my own I'm so paranoid.", "Thank you! If she quits in a year before it's paid off, whose car is it? Did this couple pay outright, or is OP paying them money they put towards a loan that is boosting *their* credit while doing nothing for OP? Are they paying for gas and mileage?

Just a heads up.", "Not relevant.", "It's only taking advantage if they're not letting her drive the car when not using it for work. Which isn't the case. As far as I can tell, she's only keeping and driving the Civic so she doesn't have to take the booster out if she wants to drive a friend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo-one made her apply for a job she didn't fit the requirements for. Seems like they found a solution that fits everyone.", "Except that's not the reason she gave. She said specifically that it's her car to do with as she wishes. If her reason in the post was \"this is a work car and I don't feel comfortable driving it for non-work reasons,\" then absolutely NTA. But her reason was that she didn't know how to accomplish a task that is not only quite easy to accomplish, but also one that she should know how to do considering her job.", "NTA. I second this. It wasn't until I realized I needed to kneel on the base and pull the tightening strap as hard as possible that I could get the < 1 inch movement in the car seat. At that time in my life it would give me anxiety seeing how loose and poorly installed some acquaintances' car seats were. At least when it was my SIL's car I was comfortable asking if I could tighten them for my nieces to a correct amount.

I don't think I would trust a nanny with my children if they couldn't figure out how to put a car seat in.", "I think OP is NTA but you and others are right that it is a good idea for OP to learn. You never know when something might get screwed up. And you want to be able to spot check the seats.\n\nMaybe have the fire department show you when you have time to arrange with the parents to also check the seats. That way you get one run through with the FD (just in case the parents have made mistakes), one run through with the parents, and you have the parents assurance that they are installed correctly.

Maybe call and ask?", "Requirement for the job was having a car. She didn't have a car, but they wanted her as the nanny. Not enough to purchase a 2nd car that they own for a nanny to use, but enough to help op get a great deal and help finance a vehicle that would make it possible for her to do this job. I would assume that op also wanted a vehicle for personal use such a said family chrismas trip. Assuming the deal on the car was a good deal, op is still getting paid and will have a valuable car out of this, not to mention even if she didn't use the car for anything else securing the nanny wage with it could easily pay off.", "Why would they just give her a car for free lmao", "I mean, nanny\u2019s typically get paid pretty well.

Con men are committing a crime even if their victims voluntarily hand over the cash.", "But it does affect the mom. OP drove in both scenarios, so taking two cars means that a second person has to drive, which means a second person is paying for gas and a second person has to remain sober to drive. She has to pay roughly the same amount for gas in both scenarios (assuming 15 miles of city driving each way, it's a difference of around $1 in gas between rated fuel economy of the the Civic and the Explorer assuming the national average, but around $2.70 for the extra gallon spent by car #2). Yes, they didn't want to drive at all when she was driving in either scenario. If we take the car seats out of the equation, almost nothing changes for OP if she drives the Explorer vs the Civic, but things get easier for the other driver.", "Guess it depends on the seat.

Nothing made me agree to getting our minivan faster than 2 carseats in the hatchback, I was very anti minivan for a long time.
