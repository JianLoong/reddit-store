There are lots of classes you can take, probably including some online. \n\nFor rear facing car seats, you have to learn how to use your seat\u2019s angle indicator. For front and rear facing, you need to know how to use the LATCH lower anchors, and you need to know how to lock the seatbelt once kids reach 40 pounds (or 65 minus the weight of the seat). You also need to know how to use the upper LATCH tethers, and you need to know how to make everything tight. It doesn\u2019t apply to this scenario, but you also need to know that rear facing straps should be at or just below your child\u2019s shoulders and forward facing straps should be at or just above your child\u2019s shoulders. And no more than a 2 finger gap between buckle and baby once the child is buckled in. \n\nWhile that is a bit of a list, I was trained on all that when my oldest child was born 10 years ago. The only refresher course I had was installing the car seats a million times.

The seats can be removed, it's just a hassle.", "Googling told me ISOFIX involves solid metal connectors from the car seat, always fixed distance. With no lateral wiggle. LATCH uses soft tethers that you have to tighten, like I said already. Clicking in the buckles to the anchors is just step one before you remove the slack. It seems LATCH came first and the two are mostly compatible with each other, but not the same, like I said. \n\nYes you have to level the base. There is no guarantee that the seat automagically know the design and angle of your car seat cushions. You have to level it. And for infants, you also have to change the angle based on weight (e.g. under 7 pounds, between 7 and 22, and over 22 pounds). If the car seat is a convertible, you might also have to adjust the level.

They offer the solution to OP, and OP agrees. None of what is happening in any way applies to any laws you are familiar with. I'm going to be honest and say I don't know either, but u do know there are different laws in child care, and even in those cases they typically don't correlate to two individuals engaged in a transaction. \n\nFact is, unless they have something in writing, the likely hood that they can get the car back in the case of a separation is possible but not likely if the laws don't allow for it in your state, it's also possible OP doesn't want it in that case, and she's not harmed in any tangible way other than the income lost as part of the loan repayment. \n\nThere are anecdotes from other nannies in this post that aren't legal issues, but issues of what is considered normal practice. \n\nBut you also touched on commercial use, which you are wrong, unless, of course, she is transporting the kids in some way to make money off the kids.

And if they tell her to do so they should get a professional to teach her how to. That is a big liability to take. In an emergency she can still use the car- as she CAN take them out- then inform her employer to be available to reinstall them. But it is not something you install unless you have to. If her other car breaks down and she uses this one and has to take one seat out I would suggest the booster seat as that is the easiest one. But I would NOT suggest then trying to install it herself.\nThe liability she has is a childs life- not her own child- someone else's child."]}
