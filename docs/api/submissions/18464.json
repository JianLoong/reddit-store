I of course accepted even though I lived 2 states away. I made time to attend every bridal shower, bachelorette party, rehearsal dinner etc. \n\nMy hometown is a few hours away from the town the wedding was in so each time I travelled I either drove a few more hours to stay with my parents or stayed on a family members couch. For the wedding, this was not an option since so much family was coming into town, all the guest bedrooms and couches were already spoken for so i planned on getting a hotel room for the night of the wedding. \n\nThe bride asked me a few weeks in advance if I needed a hotel room since she was blocking off rooms for the band and said she would block off one extra room for me. When I called the hotel they had only one extra room besides the ones she blocked off for that night so I triple checked with her that one room was for me. She assured me one was so I changed the room into my name and put my card on file. \n\nMy boyfriend also drove from two states away to come to the wedding with me and brought my dog since no one would be home to watch her. We planned on leaving her in the pet friendly hotel during the wedding and checking on her every few hours since the hotel was super close to the reception. This was also by boyfriends first time meeting my family so we were excited. \n\nThe day of the wedding the bride tells me that I no longer have a room at the hotel because they did not book enough rooms for the band so they would be taking mine. I informed her that my boyfriend and my dog we\u2019re already on there way to check in to the hotel and she basically said sorry they can\u2019t check in. All other hotels close to the area were booked solid for that night and the only available room was over 30 minutes away and $300 more than what I paid. I let her know that I spent a lot of money to travel back and forth for her wedding and didn\u2019t have the money even in my account to do so. She asked me to find somewhere else to stay, which I tried but with my boyfriend, my dog (who doesn\u2019t get along with other dogs) and I, there was literally nowhere. She told me she didn\u2019t know what to tell me so I told her if I no longer had a hotel room that I would be asking my boyfriend and dog to head back to my parents house hours away and I would be leaving the reception early to go home too. \n\nShe was very upset with me but I felt like I had no other choice and I feel as though it has ruined our relationship. The manager at the hotel informed me that since my name and card were already on the reservation that nobody else could check into my room and the bride had to send one of the band members to the other hotel that was farther away and more expensive. \n\nAm I the asshole for not giving my room up?", "created_utc": 1685374389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uy3y8/aita_for_not_giving_my_hotel_room_up_at_a_wedding/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were nice about it. And it was the brides fault. She should\u2019ve made sure. And you asked her numerous times to confirm. So the bride is the asshole not you.", "NTA. You put so much out to participate in a wedding where you were basically a last minute stand-in. The bride should be grateful you didn't just skip the wedding.", "NTA.  That was her fuckup and she tried to guilt you into solving the problem she created.", "NTA, lots of stress with weddings AND travel. You\u2019re a better person than me since I would\u2019ve said screw it and not gone if someone had given away my room.", "Nta it\u2019s the bride\u2019s fuck up and they should book another room somewhere else and offer to cover the difference at LEAST. The fact she has the audacity to ask you move hotels and pay more for her mistake is very telling. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t go because she isn\u2019t valuing you at all, the band is more important.", "Wait. Book  hotel rooms for the band?", "NTA. You checked.", "NTA.", "NTA at all.\n\nHer failure to plan correctly is not your problem. The time to figure this out was well before the day of the wedding.", "NTA. No one's fault but the brides.", "NTA this was her mistake not yours. You paid for the room she didn\u2019t.", "NTA as it wasn't her room to give away especially as you'd had the foresight to change it to your bame", "Nta, I would have not even shown to the wedding and did something with my bf", "NTA.\n\nAnd I'm betting another guest demanded an extra room, so she pulled a 'shuffle' and you got the low card.\n\nI'd also rethink whatever gift you got her to be the cheapest possible option?", "NTA\n\nDon't go to the wedding, return the gift", "NTA you booked and paid for a hotel room, it\u2019s not your fault she didn\u2019t plan appropriately.  If the closest hotel is 30 minutes away then that\u2019s where the band has to stay.  Or I would have canceled the reservation and left immediately, not into the reception, unless she was then booking me another room at the far hotel at her expense.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not only did she guarantee you multiple times that the room would be yours, she also kinda inconvenienced you making you last minute second choice bride's maid.

I wouldn\u2019t be \u201cleaving early\u201d - I just would have driven home!", "Yes. Not sure if the band was coming from out of town or what but she had booked and paid for their hotel rooms.", "Yeah, I was thinking the same. This happened to me maybe 10 years ago. I went to a friend's wedding out of state, and I think we had booked a 2- or 3-bedroom cabin where the wedding was for 3 of us (2 women, 1 man, all single). When we got there, we were told that a bridesmaid or someone in one of the families needed the room we booked. We ended up with a 1-bedroom and had no choice because they'd already let the other people check into the room we had paid for. I don't think we even got a discount or anything to make up for it. It's crazy how common this seems to be. NTA", "This was all the day of the wedding so I did still go. She ended up buying the band member the room farther away that was more expensive.

I deleted it when it got too much attention bc I was afraid the bride would see it.", "That\u2019s definitely why I considered being TA but my only option from there was to leave the wedding and go home early and she didn\u2019t want that either. I tried to find other places to stay but it wasn\u2019t fair for my boyfriend to sleep on the floor of someone\u2019s home that he was just meeting for the first time\u2026 She ended up fronting the cost for the room farther away for the band member.

I had it copied in my notes and decided it was time to post it bc I don\u2019t care anymore lol", "I mostly just got worried because YouTube channels were messaging me asking to use it in their videos. It didn\u2019t have a million comments on it but enough to make me nervous. It\u2019s still an entertaining story. I don\u2019t understand why you care so much", "I\u2019m definitely a hypochondriac lol but I do have a few health issues. That has nothing to do with this though. I posted this a few months ago and actually got nervous that the bride would see it bc it blew up so I deleted it.
