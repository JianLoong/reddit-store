You had no right to inform anyone that Amber has autism, especially at such a loud volume.

That's inappropriate as well.", "YTA this was a shit show. \n\nYou revealed your employee\u2019s private health information. \n\nYou decided TikTok would be a more effective punishment for the customer (AND AMBER) than just taking over and addressing it privately. \n\nIs this woman a regular? Is she gonna come in again and again?\n\nYou could have just stepped in and asked Amber if you could give her a hand, sent her to do some bullshit task in the back, then followed up after privately. You could\u2019ve told the customer thanks for the feedback, but we think Amber is a great employee with a more extensive knowledge than anyone else here. And you could\u2019ve defused the situation by thanking the teen girl for her concern but that you have it under control and to please move on. \n\nInstead you decided to play main character and blow this up in a really silly way that did your store more reputational damage with a valued employee than that customer leaving a yelp review ever could.", "YTA\n\nYou handled this terribly and you're fortunate that you didn't get into trouble for your behaviour. You escalated the situation immediately by accusing the customer of bullying Amber when you should have just taken over the transaction and explained that Amber might be quiet but she's a dedicated and valuable employee. \n\nThe fact you continued to aggressively push your view when the customer tried to defend herself because you were being filmed is disgusting. Corporate was correct, you should have told the teenagers to stop filming and the customer had every right to complain about how incredibly unprofessional you are. \n\nAnd on top of that, you, without permission, told everyone about Amber's autism. That isn't your place. I feel sorry for poor Amber here, not only did she receive a complaint, her own supervisor told her personal information to a store of people *and* whoever happened to see that video. \n\nWhile I think you had good intentions, they were spoiled by your complete and utter lack of tact and the fact you immediately went on the defensive.

Then, to top it off, you notice a busybody person pulling out their phone to record what is NOBODY else's business or concern and you decide to keep turning up the drama???!!!!!!!!  What WERE you thinking?!!!!   \n\nKnowing that cashiers get chatted up, a LOT, you put Amber in the position of possibly discomfort in being on the registers in the first place!  I'm not saying that because she can't handle it, as it seems she is a very gifted member of the staff.  I said that for HER comfort.  NO ONE enjoys working the registers, but knowing her specific needs, I'd think you wouldn't stick her in the direct line of fire with impossible customers.  Everyone failed her that day, from manager to customer to busy body bystander!", "Yeah ESH - I'm pretty certain you were trying to do the right thing by amber, but I imagine making the huge scene was literally the last thing she wanted. \n\nWoman was definitely obnoxious and your heart was in the right place, but ultimately you've probably made a rod for your back and made the situation worse. Uncertain about stopping the teenage filming, but I can see why it would go against corporate policy.", "ESH\n\nIt's not your place to share Amber's situation with random strangers, much less turn her into a bludgeon to attack this asshole woman with. What you should have done is nod at the woman and tell her you'll speak with Amber, then tell Amber \"*don't worry about any of that, some people suck and just want to cause problems.\"*\n\nInstead you turned her struggles into an internet meme, possibly opened your store up to litigation from multiple sources (both the woman and Amber depending on local laws on filming, business liability, and defamation), and caused bad press all around INCLUDING to Amber's reputation.", "soft YTA. I worked at a grocery store and received tons of customer complaints over minute things. Managers know that most of these complaints are baseless and their job is to diffuse. Also, she had no clue Amber was autistic and just thought a cashier was rude. Next time \"I'm sorry you felt that our cashier was rude. She's autistic and doesn't do small talk. I apologize that she upset you\" would go a long way compared to accusing her of bullying a cashier", "YTA firstly in the confrontation itself like yes complaining about a lack of small talk is super obnoxious but really a simple \"We dont insist our employees stop and chat, they are simply here to assist with your shopping\" literally covers it. Suggesting any complaints is bullying is ludicrous and bringing up Amber being autistic like that is unfair to her as well as the customer tbh. This is such a crappy remark to have made. \n\n>I tell her I\u2019m sorry that you feel like people with disabilities don\u2019t deserve jobs because you feel like everyone should carry on a conversation with you.\n\nThis is a big reach, some jobs do actually require small talk and friendly chat I agree with you that cashier is not one but come on to say she doesnt think people deserve any job because she thinks this is one where you make polite conversation... also you clearly exaggerated because of the camera. \n\nAlso I agree with the 80 year old, why tf does everything have to be filmed no doubt you both wanted to go viral and be the big heros \"saving\" the disabled woman (by announcing her information to both customers and the camera). \n\nJesus christ how have you not learned to handle a complaint better than this.", "You used this situation to selfishly try to look like a hero, instead of handling it properly.

No those kids won't listen to you anyways. (But you're cvd)\n\nThat lady sucks. Who would actually complain about not having small talk and who doubles down after conflict about it??", "NTA. For better or worse, everyone knows in today's age that you risk being filmed and blasted on social media if you're being an ass in public, and this time it seems well-deserved. People know enough about autism now to understand someone's poor social interaction skills shouldn't automatically be assumed as mere rudeness. This customer judged someone who was just trying to do her job and the woman experienced natural consequences. Also, unless your store has a policy not allowing filming on the premises, there's not much you can do about teens recording an encounter. The company is being an asshole for caring more about a judgemental woman being filmed than a customer saying an autistic person shouldn't be allowed to work with the public in the store. It's flat out ableism, and the company's actions make it seem like the customer had a point.", "NTA.  That customer complained and she needs to own it.  A cashier needs to check the customer's products and accept payment... that is all.  Is there anything in the corporate guidelines saying a customer is owed a conversation?\n\nI am currently a cashier and I get it, especially after COVID and a hurricane in Fl, some people are shopping bc they need human contact.  I am ok with that, but I do not feel they are owed that.  They can go volunteer locally, they can talk to their neighbors or their family.\n\nGeez, this is ridiculous.  Amber is a super valuable person and the store should do what they can to keep her and that includes NOT siding with the customer in this case.  Plus, if the customer didn't want to be filmed being an idiot, then she should have behaved better.\n\nEdit:  You didn't have to throw out the info about Amber being autistic; Amber could just be person who doesn't talk much for any reason.", "Gotta love it when entitled customers get called out. NTA.", "NTA for the question of the recording, but you probably could have handled the situation a but better. If you had calmly explained the situation to the customer as opposed to immediately escalating the situation, it probably would have gone over much smoother. I\u2019m sure even Amber would have preferred a calm discussion as opposed to yelling.", "You clearly are fond of Amber, sympathize with her, and that clouded your judgment. I think that is getting overlooked. You were protecting your \u201cwork family\u201d and someone you see as needing protecting. \n\nBUT the other commenters are right that you escalated the situation. The recording never would have happened had you handled things calmly and less like a protective bear looking after a cub. \n\nAs for the recording/recorder, yeah, I sympathize with you. Corporate types can tell you that you should have told them to stop, but honestly? In today\u2019s world? You stand a better chance of reaching the moon, by flapping your arms, than getting someone to stop filming, once an incident starts. And THAT is why it is so important to make sure things don\u2019t escalate to incident level.\n\nEDIT: Voting, YTA. Just I can see how this mistake came about.", "NTA keep standing up for your employees, we need more people who are willing to do that for the people under them in the workplace.

One of the worst customers I've ever had complained of similar things and despite the whole shitshow she caused over a tiny thing, my employees diagnosis was never talked about. I placated and apologised and promised to talk to the employee and dealt with this customer telling me how awful and incompetent I was just so I didn't clear it up with her by telling the diagnosis.", "This was my first thought as well.\n\nAmber\u2019s privacy was violated and that\u2019s the real issue here.\n\nNot some nonsense about an entitled customer and teens with an iPhone at the ready.\n\nI\u2019m going with YTA on behalf of Amber", "Yea i agree, this was a mess.", "Many people view antisocial body language as rude I'm autistic myself and I understand that. I'd expect my manager to not exculate the situation and put me in an even worse position.", "I agree. \n\nI think you should have the option to chat if you want, but there is not a requirement to hold lengthy conversations about topics with them. And if that were the case, nothing would ever get done!", "Sorry, that's not a reason to allow a customer to go off on her.", "You said that they got a complaint an employee was not \u2018doing a great part of their job\u2019, then proceeded to say that customer service generally includes being friendly and approachable; The customer perceived Amber as rude which is contrary to her role. Hence my response. With Ambers disability, it would not be part of her job to make eye contact and small talk with the customer. You are right, OP should have said staff aren\u2019t required to make small talk and left it at that.", "Being chatty and engaging in some customer service level small talk are really two different things in my book.", "Customer service is not something that I as an autistic person would EVER do. Because I would not be good at it. That is literally torture every day. And yes, it is part of the job, and if she cannot do it (not necessarily the small talk but being polite and at least acknowledging the small talk, smiling, and making eye contact) then that is NOT the job for her. Same as someone in a wheelchair is not going to work in construction, sorry, not sorry, but someone with autism should not be in customer service unless they can force themselves to be friendly and make eye contact and at least give a friendly non-committal chuckle or whatever to the small talk. (I do not necessarily think this is necessary for a cashier, just ring the crap up and bag it and maybe give a friendly hello, but talking about customer service in general)", "As someone who just doesn't do small talk, I disagree.   I have had cashiers try to call me out for not reciprocating their \"friendliness\" and, while I never complain to management, I always feel that they just don't understand boundaries."]}
