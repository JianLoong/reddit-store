But whatever.\n\nThere\u2019s two entrances to his house, the front door and the kitchen door.\n\n\nEvery time we hop out the car, he enters through the kitchen door an immediately locks it (which we don\u2019t know the password) and when I try to open it, he points to the front door, which is literally 20 feet away.\n\n\nToday it happened again, and I asked him. Told him \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just enter through there? It\u2019s easier.\u201d Since it\u2019s closer to our parking spot.\n\n\nHe replied with \u201cBecause, I want everybody to go through the front door.\u201d\n\n\nI then reminded him that he didn\u2019t go through the front door. He then proceeded to ignore me asking him a few more times and shut himself in his room to do who knows what.\n\n\nIt makes no sense. It can\u2019t be because he wants it to be clean, because he enters it with the same shoes I do and leaves it on the mat anyways. Which is what we all do. Not only that, he just\u2026 immediately locks it after he gets in. Like no hesitation. It\u2019s completely on purpose. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s to give him some sort of power or gratification.\n\n\nAlthough I could be just being an asshole by making it into a big deal. To me, it\u2019s just strange and I want to know why, so it became a big deal eating away at me. It\u2019s been going on for a little over a year now. But to others it may be such a small deal that it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\nI\u2019m not going to give up on this. I\u2019m going to keep asking him from now on.

Maybe dad wants a record of the kids coming and going for custody issues? \n\nEither way, it\u2019s super weird so he should at least provide his family with a reasonable expectation.", "NTA: he uses it to as a power thing and to see when you leave/enter. (OP in comments said there's a ring on the front but not kitchen door). Along with the other concerning stuff you said in the comments, is it possible to live with your mom? You're old enough for the court to care about your input.", "NTA  I'd honestly get an Uber and go back to your mom's place the next time he does it.  Your dad is on a strange sort of power trip.  I'd tell him it can end, or he can start seeing a lot less of you.  It's almost kind of dehumanizing, like, 'oh, sorry, the help uses the side door'\n\n INFO: Does that door lead to a room in the house that you're not allowed in, like dads office/study?", "Question: does your younger brother also have to use the front door? And does he have the same visitation arrangement as you? Do either or both of you have a bedroom at this house?

It means there's stuff that you can't think of because you lack the necessary information to even formulate the idea.\n\nOthers said security reasons, and it actually sounds both valid and likely. But for all we know it could be a coping mechanism for past trauma or ocd, and certainly not something he might want to discuss with his children. Or, again, something completely different that none of us can think of because we don't know the situation and what led to it.\n\nYes, it's weird. Now let your dad be weird and use the front door. He's human. He's not perfect. He can have weird habits, and this is innocuous enough that it isn't worth it to keep nagging if you were already told that you won't be given an answer.

It\u2019s such a weirdly miserable and awkward feeling. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if your dad is on a power trip or doing something sketchy, but either way, this isn\u2019t an okay way to treat your kid.", "At this point if you refuse to go, the only way he can make you is through the courts, I think.  You need to check out custody laws in your area.  If you go full time at mom\u2019s he would have to give more support.", "NTA - This sounds like a passive-aggressive 'my house' scenario.\n\nThere is a belief that \"family\" and owners can enter through side doors while GUESTS only enter through the front. If they are angry that they cannot claim you both as 'ThIeR kIdS' and your mom corrected their previous attempts, this could be their passive-aggressive way of giving you and your brother the finger (for what, not standing up for them? telling your mom?? who knows... but psychologically it's a thing and it fits).\n\nLike... 'you don't want to be part of the family so we will treat you like strangers' mentality.

Also NTA", "NTA\n\nThis seems like a power thing and while he's your dad, creating unreasonable expectations isn't healthy.\n\nTry to understand his position. Is this something he's decided or his new wife? If you have step siblings, do they also have to enter through the front door?", "YWBTA if you continue pushing at this.  The front door isn\u2019t that far away.  I don\u2019t see the benefit of forcing a confrontation on something like this.

No, I don\u2019t think this issue is worth the likely result you will get if you nag him incessantly about this.  To me that seems to be an out of proportionate response to your dad\u2019s idiosyncrasies.  So I think that yes, if you proceed to nag him about this you WBTA.  My guess is if you don\u2019t bring it up but just observe closely you will figure out the reason.  Unfortunately, once you do figure it out there is a chance the reason could be creepy or disturbing. And if it is, that is when you need to plant your flag.", "That would bug me too, but at the same time it's not nice to purposefully go against them. \n\nThey just have a weird rule that doesn't hurt anyone, 20 meters take 10 seconds to get to. But you would be provoking them repeatedly over a silly rule, that's kind of TA. I don't think it's worth hurting your relationship over this, but at the same time I get how grating it is to see things that do not make sense every day and never get an explanation. \n\nMaybe you can see it as an exercise in flexibility, getting used to there being things you don't understand but follow to show respect to your parents?

Check with r/legaladvice they might be able to help.", "Alternating weekends and alternating holiday days. Stepmom works from home as does dad. His office is upstairs in a room, hers is right in the open next to the kitchen.", "My thought is that it\u2019s a weird power dynamic. Like he wants to be reassured he has at least SOMETHING over me to tell me no to.", "Ah. I think it\u2019s something between your stepmom and dad upon coming home. Just guessing since her office is right there, there\u2019s no cameras, and the laptop thing. You probably don\u2019t actually want to know. \n\nBut you could always press your face against the window to find out. Could be potentially traumatizing though.", "This sounds most likely, they probably have a private moment since her office is right there. They sound nuts though", "I\u2019m allowed in the kitchen. Just not specifically through the door. Her laptop is always shut down when not in use anyways.", "It all does sound deeply dysfunctional. \n\nOPs asserted a couple times in other places that he thinks it\u2019s just his dad exerting power which kinda lets us know what type of person he is. \n\nThe custody situation is bonkers and weird and him putting his wife above the kids mom just seems like even more of a control grab.\n\nI bet that\u2019s HIS door and he\u2019s the only other one allowed through it so she will always know to be waiting on the other side when it opens. Could just be a kneel or a bow, but it\u2019s definitely a private thing.", "I meant the laptop thing with brother you mentioned in an earlier comment, not her laptop. \n\n I could be wrong obv since I don\u2019t know where your stepmom is when you finally make it into the house but that\u2019s my best guess", "Yeah,but they could work out a different protocol for when the kids are there. It's right to not include the kids, but they need to stop being weird and change it when they are visiting, instead.  Also, she's a shitty domne if she is abusing her daughter and prone to losing her temper. Never abuse, and have control over your temper. Those are vital things. \nOk, he could be the dom, too, I dunno. But either way, the worst ducking thing is using their CHILD'S laptop, their still underage child, to fuck around with pornography. It's not like they can't afford their own laptop, sounds like. That's over 9,000 kinds of not ok at all."]}
