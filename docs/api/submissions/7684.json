I really need some outside advice to see if I was really in the wrong\n\n\nI (42M) have a 19 year old daughter with epilepsy. It was a pretty recent development and we've just now managed to get used to it and have it managed. I was downstairs one evening searching for my reading glasses when I heard her say she was going to take a bath.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of fruitless searching, I went upstairs to see if I left them up there. That's when I heard a loud noise from the bathroom, like something fell. I knocked a few times and asked if she was okay, but I didn't get a response. I waited another minute before opening the door and finding her seizing and slipping under the water. What I heard was her knocking over some of the shampoo bottles when she began to shake. Her mouth went under and I freaked out. I held her up until she stopped seizing and then pulled her out of the water entirely. The bathroom isn't very big so I carried her to her room right next door and laid her down on the floor with a pillow. I started shouting for my wife for her meds and to bring a phone in case we needed to call EMS.\u00a0\n\n\nShe was naked, so I found a robe on her floor and threw it on her. She woke up after a few minutes, confused, and we gave her the medicine. My wife and I sat with her for probably an hour while she came back to her senses. I wanted to go to the ER, but my kid is stubborn as heck and wouldn't go. After a while, we all calmed down and left her alone to get dressed and relax.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was after that, when we were going to bed, that my wife had an attitude. I asked what was wrong and she snapped. I was told that I should've shouted for her immediately when I realized what was happening. It was okay for me to have held her up in the bath, but it was inappropriate and disgusting that I carried our naked daughter to her room and that I put a robe on her without my wife being there. She said she would've handled the situation since our daughter was nude. Obviously, I panicked and I didn't think anything of it. I told her that it was my daughter in an emergency situation and that it didn't matter. It wasn't ideal for me either but it was just my kid.\u00a0\n\n\nShe told her parents and mine over the next few days and the results haven't been pretty. My wife's parents are furious and my FIL called me every name under the sun for \"looking at his granddaughter\". My MIL and my parents were more understanding, but did say that next time I should get my wife because it would be more appropriate since our daughter was naked and that seemed perverted. My daughter said that she didn't mind that I helped her instead of her mom and didn't feel weird about it, but our families have not let up.\u00a0\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674081962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fkua7/aita_for_pulling_my_daughter_out_of_the_bathtub/", "score": 588, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone in that state can pull water into their lungs and be drowning/losing oxygen to their brain in less than 30 seconds.\n\nYour wife sounds horrendous and I have some very strong, and not very nice words to describe your FIL. (that could be my own FIL trauma projecting though)\n\nYou responded quickly and decisively in a crisis and because of it, your daughter didn't drown.\n\nI am *livid* on your behalf, not gonna lie. What. The actual. Fuck.\n\nNTA\n\nI think the reason I'm so pissed about this on your behalf is that it infuriates me to no end all the bullshit stigmas attached to fatherhood of girls, as a dad of my own two daughters, and this is prime example of it.\n\nNext time you should let your daughter potentially drown in the time it takes mommy to come to get her, so you can preserve her *modesty*. Clearly, you must be some kind of creep. /s  \n\n\nUgh. What a load of horse shit.", "How are you the AH for not letting your adult daughter, naked or not, drown? \n\nMy heavens.\n\nNTA", "Yikes. All those adults are very creepy for sexualizing a medical emergency like that. Creepy \ud83d\ude2c\n\nNTA. A naked body doesn't have to be anything sexual, and you carrying her naked to her room was only a dad caring for his daughter during a medical situation. There is nothing more to it than that.", "You are a hero. Your FIL and your wife are assholes. I'd be having serious chats with my wife about her frankly bizarre notions. Interesting that she and HER father have the weird sexual hang up, no?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a stretch, but was your wife sexually abused?\n\nMaybe by her father?\n\nIt\u2019s pretty weird to me that that whole family is sexualizing this. Like, I can put any two of my family members in this position and think the way they think.\n\nEdit: take these as thought questions, I don\u2019t want a response.", "NTA your wife needs fucking therapy for sexualizing your daughters emergency. How dare she", "So first of all I've been trying to read through all these comments because this blew up really fast and I didn't think I'd get all this support. I was really starting to doubt myself with all of the negativity I was getting from my wife and FIL because the last thing I want is for anyone to think I was trying to sexualize my daughter. That's my little girl. I appreciate all of the support and I'm really feeling pretty good at the moment. \n\nI'm going to have a long, probably very emotional talk with my wife about what's going on with her and this reaction.  But now that I'm sitting here at work with some time to think things over and seeing what other people have to say, I'm starting to think something is amiss that I should've handled way earlier before this incident happened. \n\nWhen the kids were babies (we have two daughters and a son), she would always insist on bathing them and changing their diapers. I was a young dad and never really thought much about it because I wasn't exactly volunteering for diaper duty. Looking back, I should've said something about that because it is very weird that she would get upset whenever I'd try to help out by bathing, changing, or dressing them. I assumed it was because I didn't do it right or was cutting into her time with the kids, so I never really thought about. It never occured to me that it was some sort of demented mistrust. I certainly never thought it would lead us to this situation. \n\nAlso, for those of you that asked, I don't think it's a cultural thing. We live in the US, in the Midwest. While I know it isn't common to see your adult kids naked, I also never thought I'd get backlash for taking her to her room. Maybe it's just my wife's family. I've never heard her family protest what we do with the kids, but we've also never been in this type of situation before for me to know their reactions. My FIL and I will need a talk too because I knew I wasn't in the wrong to begin with, but this post really confirms it. If I had to do it all over again, I would because my kid got to see another day. \n\nThank you all for all you've said and done. My daughter is doing just fine and I'm trying not to involve her in the drama. While she didn't have an issue with me seeing her like that, she has been very embarrased about what her seizure caused between me and her grandfather. \n\nI've also made it a point to encourage her to maybe shower instead of bathe. Better safe than sorry. \n\nThanks again everyone!", "Your wife and her parents are D I S G U S T I N G", "NTA. You saved your daughter from drowning. More concerning what type of man your wife and  her family think you are?", "NTA - your wife and her family sound NUTS! . Are they from a culture where a female is better off dead than being seen nude by her father as he attempts to save her life? The only person who\u2019s opinion matters here is your daughter\u2019s. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s business.", "NTA- you went into parent mode. You saved her from drowning and covered her up once she was safe and comfortable away from water.

You saved your daughter's life. WTF is wrong with your family, especially your wife? It must be very hard to breathe up there on that high horse. You were very brave and everyone should be grateful. Nothing perverted here, and I am speaking as a former family therapist who treated sexually abusive families-I know what perversion looks like, and this ain't it.", "NTA. What the hell??? Your daughter's life was in real danger and your wife is angry that you briefly saw her naked during her *seizure?* That's absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. I really hate the way nudity is viewed these days especially in situations like this. I have a daughter and if I wasn\u2019t immediately right there I would hope that her dad would help our daughter himself in this situation. People  for some reason like to make things creepy or gross when they aren\u2019t\u2026. \n\nIt actually makes me really upset for you that you\u2019re now getting these accusations for simply wanting to save your daughter from a potentially dangerous situation.", "Wow, NTA. Not at all.\n\nIf you, her father, shouldn\u2019t be saving her life while she is naked because it is \u2018inappropriate\u2019.. they\u2019d lose their shit over the idea that doctors and surgeons see naked people all the time, what perverts!\n\nHas she ever had a Pap smear before? /:\n\nA naked body is not inherently sexual, especially not when it\u2019s a medical issue.", "NTA You, your wife and daughter need to research SUDEP (Sudden Explained Death in Epilepsy). My nephew died as a result of a seizure 5 years ago. When an epileptic is seizing the last thing you need to worry about is modesty  I suggest you all make an appointment with her neurologist to or contact CURE to learn more.", "Uhhhh she's your daughter, you probably saved her life. At that point it doesn't matter who she is, you did the absolute right thing. \n\nI think they are telling much more about themselves than anything to do with you, and showing a possible inherent distrust of you. They would prefer risking her life... For what? \n\nOnly your daughter's opinion matters here. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nYour wife and family are ridiculous!  I\u2019m offended for you that they would take a medical emergency and turn it into something perverted/ sexual.  Has your daughter said anything about you seeing her naked?", "NTA.  Daughters survival trumps all of these other thoughtless complaints.   Wife and family clearly have no understanding for the facts of life.  They are ignorant of the medical situation and they have proven themselves assholes for all of the abuse and name calling rained on you.  Who doesn't know that survival is more important than social custom?", "NTA. She's your child for goodness sakes, and she was in very real danger of drowning. Two additional points need to be made. Is your wife strong enough to carry a grown woman out of the bathroom? Second, I'm sure your daughter is grateful for you to have come along when you did and that you acted as you did.", "NTA WHAT??????? It's your daughter and she could have DROWNED? Who has an attitude like that and for shame on your wife and everyone else involved. They all being very creepy here.", "NTA. They're the ones making it sexual for some reason. There was an emergency situation and you reacted. You could've saved your daughters life because of how you handled it. You covered her as soon as she was in a safe location.

She was a nice person. The only one that seemed interested in talking to me. So naturally on woodshop day in school, I would look forward to seeing her. Then one morning, she didnt come in. And everyone was acting different. Off. Turns out she was taking a bath that morning and seized. She drowned.  \n\n\nNTA. Seriously, all of your family members are pieces of crap. Seriously they have some serious issues.  All that matters is that your daughter is safe. She might not want to be taking baths without some sort of safety precautions in place. If she is good with you, then that's all that matters. I would tell all of the family members that said what I did was inappropriate that they can kick rocks and I want nothing to do with them going forward. Some people are truly disgusting.", "Good god - def NTA. Your daughter has a medical issue and you basically saved her life. Then you carry her to her room and get her clothing. Oh - and you did all that because of course all you wanted to do was ogle her. WTF is wrong with the ppl in your family???", "I mean, you\u2019re her father. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a random stranger. I understand there\u2019s privacy etc, but it was an emergency situation. Why does it sound like they don\u2019t trust you around a young girl, who\u2019s your daughter? That seems really off to me.

Seriously, what TF.", "Something is wrong with each and every one of them. \nNot you. \nHow dare they sexualize you providing EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE for your seizing daughter IN A BATH. Something is wrong with THEM,  not you. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour wife and her father are messed up prefering for your daughter to be put into danger just so that you don't carry/see her nude? It's your daughter ffs, there's nothing sexual about it. If my FIL had that reaction, I wouldn't want him near my daughter (and/or wife) by himself ever again. That seems like projecting. Red flag due to messed up views or a flag pointing to a possibly dark past of sexual abuse between your wife and FIL? Why else would the both of them share that reaction?", "So your daughter was having a medical emergency and you helped remove her from a dangerous situation and your wife has an issue with it? \n\nNTA, what does she propose you do if she had not been home, simply hold her above water indefinitely?", "NTA.\n\nYour wife sure is though. You dadreflexed and saved your daughter\u2019s life and all she is focusing on is the fact that she was nude?? \n\nSo many emergency incidents happen in the bathroom of the home.

I'm epileptic and I don't take sitting baths for this reason, I choose to shower only. Much less risk of drowning.

There are fathers out there who care for their adult disabled daughters and see them naked. Mothers who do the same for their sons. Your family has the problem not you.", "NTA. The fact that your family doesn't trust you around your daughter is concerning. Especially your wife. I'd call that a pretty big red flag. Your daughter has a dangerous condition, and this will likely not be the last time you find her in a compromising situation if you continue to take care of her through this. Frankly, the person whose opinion matters the most in this is your daughter's, so as long as she is comfortable with it, I don't see that you did anything wrong.\n\nAs for \"should have shouted for your wife immediately,\" I disagree. Having her help your nude daughter when possible is likely more appropriate. However, the immediate concern in this situation was to make sure your daughter was not in danger of drowning, which she was, and which you saved her from. If you had waited for your wife, she might have gotten a lungfull of water during the wait. That is far too steep a price in my mind.", "NTA. It was an emergency situation and you made what I would do as well if I had a daughter. In my opinion your wife is the asshole here. You are together for 19 years at least, and she does not trust you?", "NTA!!! What kind of bull crap is this! You saved her, I bet your wife wouldn't have been able to carry her to the bedroom, or pull her out of the tub. I can not believe that they would make you feel bad for saving your daughter. You are a hero and nothing less.", "NTA, you didn't want her drowning.  You wife probably would have needed your help anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou saved your daughters life, fuck \"appropriate\". How would it have been more important to just hold her while you wait for your wife when your daughter is STILL naked, instead of moving her to safety and getting her covered up? They can all get bent. How does your DAUGHTER feel about it? That's the important opinion.", "NTA.\n\nNudity shouldn\u2019t be something so taboo and sexualized.

To essentially accuse your of abusing your daughter when you were saving her freaking life is so disgusting that there just aren't words.  Some major apologies are owed to you.

You got her out of the situation and cared for her, including covering her.

I really need some outside advice to see if I was really in the wrong\n\n\nI (42M) have a 19 year old daughter with epilepsy. It was a pretty recent development and we've just now managed to get used to it and have it managed. I was downstairs one evening searching for my reading glasses when I heard her say she was going to take a bath.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of fruitless searching, I went upstairs to see if I left them up there. That's when I heard a loud noise from the bathroom, like something fell. I knocked a few times and asked if she was okay, but I didn't get a response. I waited another minute before opening the door and finding her seizing and slipping under the water. What I heard was her knocking over some of the shampoo bottles when she began to shake. Her mouth went under and I freaked out. I held her up until she stopped seizing and then pulled her out of the water entirely. The bathroom isn't very big so I carried her to her room right next door and laid her down on the floor with a pillow. I started shouting for my wife for her meds and to bring a phone in case we needed to call EMS.\u00a0\n\n\nShe was naked, so I found a robe on her floor and threw it on her. She woke up after a few minutes, confused, and we gave her the medicine. My wife and I sat with her for probably an hour while she came back to her senses. I wanted to go to the ER, but my kid is stubborn as heck and wouldn't go. After a while, we all calmed down and left her alone to get dressed and relax.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was after that, when we were going to bed, that my wife had an attitude. I asked what was wrong and she snapped. I was told that I should've shouted for her immediately when I realized what was happening. It was okay for me to have held her up in the bath, but it was inappropriate and disgusting that I carried our naked daughter to her room and that I put a robe on her without my wife being there. She said she would've handled the situation since our daughter was nude. Obviously, I panicked and I didn't think anything of it. I told her that it was my daughter in an emergency situation and that it didn't matter. It wasn't ideal for me either but it was just my kid.\u00a0\n\n\nShe told her parents and mine over the next few days and the results haven't been pretty. My wife's parents are furious and my FIL called me every name under the sun for \"looking at his granddaughter\". My MIL and my parents were more understanding, but did say that next time I should get my wife because it would be more appropriate since our daughter was naked and that seemed perverted. My daughter said that she didn't mind that I helped her instead of her mom and didn't feel weird about it, but our families have not let up.\u00a0\n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA  You acted entirely appropriately in the situation.", "NTA, your wife and her family are complete perverts though. Idk, I feel like I might be getting divorced if my wife suggested I was getting off to my epileptic daughter, or had ulterior (sexual) motives, after literally saving her fucking life. But that's just me. If your wife wanted you to wait to save her life, she's a terrible mother. I feel like something is missing from this story.", "NTA\n\nNot only is the suggestion that you did anything wrong completely insane, but I'm assuming when your wife told her parents what happened the onus was less on the fact that you saved her child's life, and more on the fact that you saw her child naked.  That they appear to have forgotten she's your child too is just baffling.     \n\nTheir reaction is just not normal.  Even your own parents' comment that it seemed perverted is ridiculous.  No wonder you're confused.  I don't even know you and I'm confused on your behalf.", "Nta, tell your wife to stop being ridiculous. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA: You saved your daughter from drowning. Why is your wife so insecure? You are a protector of your daughter. Of course, you\u2019re going to suspect something is wrong, when you hear a loud bump and she\u2019s not responding. You knew something was wrong and acted. It seems you acted on impulse. The bathroom was small, so you moved her to her room. You didn\u2019t want her hitting her head and doing further injury to herself, while convulsing.

Would your FIL have let her be in danger or would he have rescued her? Would he have looked at her 'that way'? Ask him that. What about male medical professionals? Are they perverted? I'll have to tell that to the surgeon who saved my life and the nurses who cared for me afterward. \n\nAny perversion is in the minds of those who are telling you not to care for your daughter.

And what about your wife? If it were a boy child, would she be expected to wait for your assistance so that it wasn\u2019t deemed perverted? Of course not, that\u2019s ridiculous! I\u2019m really saddened that men have to put up with the awful assumption that they\u2019re predators in public & with strangers, but to be subjected to that within your family is disgusting.\n\nI\u2019m pleased that your daughter is with you on this. I honestly think that this is a hill to die on \u2026 both for you and your daughter (and any other children you have).

I don\u2019t see what your wife had to gain from this other than to rally to troops to pile on your further. If your daughter is 19 I can only assume that you\u2019ve been together a long time. This is such a betrayal and I feel gutted for you.", "NTA. As a 23yo woman, I don\u2019t care who\u2019s pulling me out of the water. Mom, dad, MIL, FIL, BIL, the neighbor, a hamster, just get me out. You put a robe on her, and in no way was this situation sexual AT ALL. You saved her life. \n\nTalk to your daughter. Ask her if it made her uncomfortable, and if it were to happen again, if she\u2019d prefer you to wait for her mother or EMS. If she needs an apology, give her one, but however she feels about the situation matters most. Then relay the game plan to your wife. Daughter doesn\u2019t care who pulls her out? It\u2019s not your wife\u2019s problem or right to be angry. Jesus. I could not imagine being angry with my husband saving my daughter in any circumstance. Or anyone for that matter. Just help my child. Good grief.", "NTA.\n\nI think it\u2019s disgusting that your family thinks of this situation as perverted instead of life-saving.

If anyone, regardless who they are to me, was seizing in the water like you described, I would do the same thing.

If your wife and her parents are seriously thinking you were inappropriately looking at your daughter when she was having a seizure they are disgusting.  You moved your daughter from an unsafe environment where she could have drowned in the bath to a safer environment where you could monitor her and you covered her as soon as you could.

Your daughter did not mind and that's really the only person's opinion that matters.

It's not like you let yourself in to ogle her body like your wife and FIL are making out?! And I'm sure in this situation you didn't even have time to think about the fact that she was nude/look at her body anyway because you'd have been more focused on keeping her head above the water... I seriously can't see the problem, or where you'd even have had the time to see much of her body, even then, it's a body. We've all got one. Nothing necessarily sexual about it. Especially when it's your daughter in a medical emergency.

NTA.", "By the wife and her family\u2019s logic, if the daughter\u2019s heart had stopped, does that mean OP couldn\u2019t rip off his daughter\u2019s shirt to apply a defibrillator to her chest?  Imo, modesty kind of goes out the window in a medical emergency.", "Absolutely agree. I was a CNA for awhile and saw more nude old people than I can count. Was it ever sexual? No. In medical emergencies people who try to sexualize the situation are absolute creeps. What was he supposed to do? Keep the shower curtain closed, listen to his daughter drown while screaming for his wife? Like you said this is a dad saving his daughter, the fact people are calling him a pervert is disrespectful and disgusting to OP. NTA", "Yeah exactly.  \n\nYour kid is in a medical emergency.  You should have sat there and let her die rather than save her and see her naked.  \nFucking bullshit.  \n\nNTA.  \n\nI don't care about genders, if the choice is between see me naked or maybe watch me drown myself, please go ahead and pull my ass out of the tub.", "I guess giving anyone CPR is outta the question since he might touch a boob. \ud83d\ude44", "Now that you made a point of it, yes it is rather interesting, that hadn't struck me at first.", "Omg good point. My grandfather was a predator and this sounds like the kind of reaction my aunt would have to similar situations.", "It's like they don't trust OP around his daughter.", "If that's not the case, I wonder if that suggestion might actually put the events into perspective for OP's wife. After all, if she finds the idea that her father could do something like that ridiculous or insane, then she might realise that's how OP feels about this situation with their daughter.", "Ding ding ding\nThey are the only ones upset by this.", "no kidding, the way his FIL's mind goes straight to \" looking his granddaughter that way\" when OP was trying to keep his daughter alive speaks volumes...like...does he see his own daughter that way?", "It's sickening. Seconds literally matter in this situation.", "Seriously! And sexualizing a father\u2019s heroic parental instincts to protect his kid! Why can\u2019t good dads just be good dads!!!", "Unfortunately, showers come with their own danger when it comes to falling and other fun stuff.  I'd recommend a shower chair and some grip bars for the wall.", "I honestly don't know why your wife's family is sexualising it, of course you wouldn't be thinking those thoughts.\n\nYou saved their daughter/granddaughters life and that should be the main thing.\n\nAlso if the mother didn't hear the crash, would she of heard you yell?\n\nAny normal dad would have done what you did and wouldnt have taken the risk, your mind was just on saving your little girl.", "The key thing is that your daughter is safe and most importantly still alive. Everyone should be happy about that. There's a damage to your wife and her family that has warped their view of the situation, which is making them overlook that your wife didn't realise something was wrong until you'd already gotten your daughter out of the water.", "Having read this response coupled with what your FIL said about \u201clooking at his granddaughter,\u201d I\u2019m starting to get a really uncomfortable vibe from your wife\u2019s family. This might be completely wrong, and I don\u2019t want to jump the gun, but it sounds like your wife has either had some sort of sexual abuse herself, maybe from FIL or another family member. Or she\u2019s been brought up by her family to believe all men get aroused by naked women even if they\u2019re related. There\u2019s definitely some trauma there. And the fact you said she didn\u2019t trust you with your kids even as babies is a really worrying sign. I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s so pissed off about what happened and made it weird. It would make sense if she was abused in some capacity herself, or witnessed abuse why she has an issue with what occurred when you saved your daughters life. She\u2019s still wrong about it, but if that\u2019s the case I can understand why she reacted the way she did at least. Keep us updated OP if possible.", "I'm wondering if your wife has somepersonal trauma around the issue. My hubby changed diapers and bathed both our kids. He still cuddles with our 5 year old girl, and when she had a fever induced seizure the doctors told us to strip her down. I never once thought it was inappropriate, assuming someone will do that means taking your mind to some dark places where no reasonable person would go. Personally I'd like an update after you talk to wife and FIL.", "You are such a good dad.", "You\u2019re such a good dad. Don\u2019t let them get into your head. It\u2019s such a bizarre reaction to you saving your daughter\u2019s life.", "Please do update us!", "You sound like a saint. Their insinuation is so sick and deranged that if anyone went anywhere near that with me, conversations would be very different. Your daughter is lucky to have you.", "NTA \n\nBut I do wonder if your wife is treating your kids the way she wishes her mom had treated her. Maybe she wishes she had been protected from her dad. \n\nCould your FIL be projecting his perversions onto you? If he abused your wife growing up, it would explain a lot about both his reaction and hers.", "Thank you for this reply.", ">A naked body is not inherently sexual, especially not when it\u2019s a medical issue.\n\nThe whole comment is correct, especially this part.", "Even strangers, if a defibrillator is ever needed to be used on someone who\u2019s down, the shirt comes off and even the bra if it\u2019s going to get in the way of the pads. \n\nNudity doesn\u2019t mean a damn thing when seconds count and a life is on the line!", "Let the daughter drown so that FIL and wife don\u2019t worry about him /s", "This here", "Yeah, my sister is intellectually disabled and walks around the house naked FAR too often, but there\u2019s nothing sexual about it.", "From the sounds of it hold her head above water, but don't look at her, and then somehow call her so she can drive home and deal with it?\n\nYeah, that makes sense. /s", "As an EMT we carried shears to cut clothes off.", "I had an emergency at home and called an ambulance. My pyjama pants I was wearing had massive rips in them and I was commando underneath. Male paramedics picked me up and put me on my bed to treat me.\n\nI did not care one iota that he could see part of my bum - I was in emergency levels of agony and that\u2019s all my mind was occupied with.", "At the end of the OP, he said his daughter didn\u2019t mind that he helped her and didn\u2019t feel weird at all about it.", "She is not a prude she is a perv for implying that him helping his daughter when sik in any way would be a sexuall event. For emlying that he would EVER look at his daughter in a sexuall way.\nShe should be ashame!!!\n\nHe did the exact right thing.... took her away from the whater.  2 yers ago a neighbour of mines daughter drowned in the tub from an epeleptic seizure.\n\nShe should really be greatful of him for taking such good care of their child.", "This! The family is the one acting sketchy. Wtf. A woman almost dies in the bath and they are mad her dad saw her in the nude? Wtf. Somethings missing.", "This was my thought exactly....what happened in that family for them to assume anyone would look at their daughter that way. I can't even imagine anyone reacting that way to a father saving his daughter.", "Exactly. When someone projects some twisted crap like that on something, the first thing I wonder if what skeletons they have in THEIR closet. I would watch out for grampa, now!", "Someone has a history of perving but I don't think it's the op. \n\nIt's grandpa.", "This is what I was going to comment. Even if he called his wife to come, would she be able to lift her in the first place? There is no way I could lift an adult out of a bathtub.", "I do not understand wife\u2019s response. The man literally saved his daughter\u2019s life and should be praised by everyone in the family. Absolutely NTA and there is nothing to be said for wife and IL\u2019s behavior.", "Explain how the wife\u2019s response was understandable", "This!\n\nThere is such a thing as male carers who have to wash and bathe naked clients. They're not sexualising their client, they are just getting the job done.\n\nPeople who are sexualising this are really twisted, they should be thankful OP was there.", "Also who would say the wife would've heard him. She didn't hear the crash or she would be upstairs running like OP was.\n\nAre they suggesting OP should  leave the daughter drowning and search the house for the mum.", "But it would have been his fault if his daughter died!  What is wrong with these people??? This was a f\u2019in emergency! My aunt has epilepsy. I\u2019ve seen her seize; it\u2019s scary. Good job Dad! NTA", "Exactly this.\n\nI would pretty much never say a woman should be singing a man's praises but if there's any case where they should...\n\nliterally saving her daughter's life seems a good occasion as any.", "I'm just going to tag on here to address something OP said: \n\n>It was okay for me to have held her up in the bath, but it was inappropriate and disgusting that I carried our naked daughter to her room and that I put a robe on her without my wife being there. \n\nThis is STILL patently ridiculous. In an emergency situation people do not think about stuff like this, nor should they.", "Exactly\n\nIn those situation *literally* every second matters!", "I guess they forgot that the only other option would\u2019ve been OP letting his daughter get hurt or die. Wife and FIL owe OP an apology at the minimum.", "And like logistical question.... Would your wife be able to carry your adult daughter?\n\nLike all in all this is really a disgusting response to a frightened father saving his daughter but like I'm trying to think wtf she'd do like clothe her then call you in to carry her???\n\nAnd like if she's so worried about her daughter's privacy WHY TELL EVERYONE???\n\nNTA", "In a situation like this....that kind of thought would never even cross my mind!  All I would be thinking would be Omg...thank God you were upstairs and saved her! Wtf is wrong with these people?????", "I have had to lift a seizing child. I can't imagine a grown woman who is wet up and out of a tub.\nI guess if wife isn't home he is supposed to let daughter die.", "Exactly, I couldn\u2019t be with a spouse who did this to me.", "If I was naked and started having a life threatening event of some kind, I don't think I'd give a shit who saw me naked as long as they were helping me. \n\nIt's not like OP barged in and stared at his daughter to be creepy. He knocked, didn't get an answer repeatedly, and then entered to find her about to drown. He saved her life. Its his _daughter_. He bathed her and changed her diaper when she was a baby (I hope). Is it maybe a bit awkward because she's grown? Eh, maybe, but it's not like he chose the timing of her seizure. \n\nNTA obviously", "Every single CPR class and lifeguarding class I've taken has had the exact same mentality.\n\nIf they are embarrassed, good.  Because that means they lived to be embarrassed.", "It is extremely concerning to me that FIL refers to OP's daughter as *his* granddaughter, as if she belongs to him and OP is just a babysitter. What the fuck?", "My SIL is blind and impaired both physically and intellectually. She also has seizures. She normally lives in a \u201cshared living\u201d type situation, but she spends some holidays and weekends with us. Showering has to be done seated and supervised to avoid what happened to OPs daughter. I don\u2019t know how you would feel anything but proud that they are such great caregiver.", "Oh it jumped out at me, because it seems like they both automatically assume that a father will be sexually attracted to his daughter and would want to act on it. Which is concerning but the implications of that are FIL was attracted to the wife and acted on it", "Ugh :(", "Yes OP this would be the best solution! This way there's plenty of things to hold onto, and she can sit more safely. I wish you luck on talking with your family, and I'm so glad your daughter is safe! You're a fantastic father, keep looking out for your loved ones!", "You might want to consider sharing this thread with your daughter.\n\nShe knows you saved your life, but 19 is pretty young to have to deal with the kind of grossness your wife is bringing to the table. It would likely help her deal with that if she reads the thread.", "Exactly! I mean I could understand if they were of the SO register or something but she could have drown", "Absolutely.", "I absolutely thought this too.", "My daughter is 12 and I\u2019m not sure I could lift her out of the tub while she\u2019s having a seizure and I don\u2019t consider myself weak.", "And they owe the daughter an apology, too - considering that the message that they just conveyed to her is that it would've been better than her to die than for her own father to see her nude body.\n\nSeriously, we as a society need to get over this hang-up over seeing other people nude - especially in the opposite biological sex.", "They need to give you a written apology!", "> I was naked and started having a life threatening event of some kind, I don't think I'd give a shit who saw me naked as long as they were helping me.\n\nEveryone likes to think, \"Oh when I have an emergency I'll just get properly dressed before getting on with it!\"  Lots of people don't understand words.", "I also asked OP if his wife has a history of being abused, assaulted, or exploited, because I agree her response is extremely concerning and frankly disturbing.\n\nEdit: OP posted a followup comment about 20 minutes before your post, did you see it?  Wife was strangely opposed to him even changing the kids' diapers when they were little.  This is sounding more and more suspicious...", "I'd also show the wife and FIL.", "I think grandpa needs to be on the registry", "His wife wouldn't have been able to lift her out of the tub and he would have had to get involved anyway. Plus, he wiped her a$$ as a baby, he was respectful and covered her with a robe. I'm not sure why the wife is so upset and getting everyone in the family involved. It sounds like she has some serious issues.", "Oh my god this is getting bad"]}
