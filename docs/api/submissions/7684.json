I really need some outside advice to see if I was really in the wrong\n\n\nI (42M) have a 19 year old daughter with epilepsy. It was a pretty recent development and we've just now managed to get used to it and have it managed. I was downstairs one evening searching for my reading glasses when I heard her say she was going to take a bath.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of fruitless searching, I went upstairs to see if I left them up there. That's when I heard a loud noise from the bathroom, like something fell. I knocked a few times and asked if she was okay, but I didn't get a response. I waited another minute before opening the door and finding her seizing and slipping under the water. What I heard was her knocking over some of the shampoo bottles when she began to shake. Her mouth went under and I freaked out. I held her up until she stopped seizing and then pulled her out of the water entirely. The bathroom isn't very big so I carried her to her room right next door and laid her down on the floor with a pillow. I started shouting for my wife for her meds and to bring a phone in case we needed to call EMS.\u00a0\n\n\nShe was naked, so I found a robe on her floor and threw it on her. She woke up after a few minutes, confused, and we gave her the medicine. My wife and I sat with her for probably an hour while she came back to her senses. I wanted to go to the ER, but my kid is stubborn as heck and wouldn't go. After a while, we all calmed down and left her alone to get dressed and relax.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was after that, when we were going to bed, that my wife had an attitude. I asked what was wrong and she snapped. I was told that I should've shouted for her immediately when I realized what was happening. It was okay for me to have held her up in the bath, but it was inappropriate and disgusting that I carried our naked daughter to her room and that I put a robe on her without my wife being there. She said she would've handled the situation since our daughter was nude. Obviously, I panicked and I didn't think anything of it. I told her that it was my daughter in an emergency situation and that it didn't matter. It wasn't ideal for me either but it was just my kid.\u00a0\n\n\nShe told her parents and mine over the next few days and the results haven't been pretty. My wife's parents are furious and my FIL called me every name under the sun for \"looking at his granddaughter\". My MIL and my parents were more understanding, but did say that next time I should get my wife because it would be more appropriate since our daughter was naked and that seemed perverted. My daughter said that she didn't mind that I helped her instead of her mom and didn't feel weird about it, but our families have not let up.\u00a0\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674081962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fkua7/aita_for_pulling_my_daughter_out_of_the_bathtub/", "score": 5045, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone in that state can pull water into their lungs and be drowning/losing oxygen to their brain in less than 30 seconds.\n\nYour wife sounds horrendous and I have some very strong, and not very nice words to describe your FIL. (that could be my own FIL trauma projecting though)\n\nYou responded quickly and decisively in a crisis and because of it, your daughter didn't drown.\n\nI am *livid* on your behalf, not gonna lie. What. The actual. Fuck.\n\nNTA\n\nI think the reason I'm so pissed about this on your behalf is that it infuriates me to no end all the bullshit stigmas attached to fatherhood of girls, as a dad of my own two daughters, and this is prime example of it.\n\nNext time you should let your daughter potentially drown in the time it takes mommy to come to get her, so you can preserve her *modesty*. Clearly, you must be some kind of creep. /s  \n\n\nUgh. What a load of horse shit.", "How are you the AH for not letting your adult daughter, naked or not, drown? \n\nMy heavens.\n\nNTA", "Yikes. All those adults are very creepy for sexualizing a medical emergency like that. Creepy \ud83d\ude2c\n\nNTA. A naked body doesn't have to be anything sexual, and you carrying her naked to her room was only a dad caring for his daughter during a medical situation. There is nothing more to it than that.", "You are a hero. Your FIL and your wife are assholes. I'd be having serious chats with my wife about her frankly bizarre notions. Interesting that she and HER father have the weird sexual hang up, no?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a stretch, but was your wife sexually abused?\n\nMaybe by her father?\n\nIt\u2019s pretty weird to me that that whole family is sexualizing this. Like, I can put any two of my family members in this position and think the way they think.\n\nEdit: take these as thought questions, I don\u2019t want a response.", "NTA your wife needs fucking therapy for sexualizing your daughters emergency. How dare she", "So first of all I've been trying to read through all these comments because this blew up really fast and I didn't think I'd get all this support. I was really starting to doubt myself with all of the negativity I was getting from my wife and FIL because the last thing I want is for anyone to think I was trying to sexualize my daughter. That's my little girl. I appreciate all of the support and I'm really feeling pretty good at the moment. \n\nI'm going to have a long, probably very emotional talk with my wife about what's going on with her and this reaction.  But now that I'm sitting here at work with some time to think things over and seeing what other people have to say, I'm starting to think something is amiss that I should've handled way earlier before this incident happened. \n\nWhen the kids were babies (we have two daughters and a son), she would always insist on bathing them and changing their diapers. I was a young dad and never really thought much about it because I wasn't exactly volunteering for diaper duty. Looking back, I should've said something about that because it is very weird that she would get upset whenever I'd try to help out by bathing, changing, or dressing them. I assumed it was because I didn't do it right or was cutting into her time with the kids, so I never really thought about. It never occured to me that it was some sort of demented mistrust. I certainly never thought it would lead us to this situation. \n\nAlso, for those of you that asked, I don't think it's a cultural thing. We live in the US, in the Midwest. While I know it isn't common to see your adult kids naked, I also never thought I'd get backlash for taking her to her room. Maybe it's just my wife's family. I've never heard her family protest what we do with the kids, but we've also never been in this type of situation before for me to know their reactions. My FIL and I will need a talk too because I knew I wasn't in the wrong to begin with, but this post really confirms it. If I had to do it all over again, I would because my kid got to see another day. \n\nThank you all for all you've said and done. My daughter is doing just fine and I'm trying not to involve her in the drama. While she didn't have an issue with me seeing her like that, she has been very embarrased about what her seizure caused between me and her grandfather. \n\nI've also made it a point to encourage her to maybe shower instead of bathe. Better safe than sorry. \n\nThanks again everyone!", "Your wife and her parents are D I S G U S T I N G", "NTA. You saved your daughter from drowning. More concerning what type of man your wife and  her family think you are?", "NTA - your wife and her family sound NUTS! . Are they from a culture where a female is better off dead than being seen nude by her father as he attempts to save her life? The only person who\u2019s opinion matters here is your daughter\u2019s. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s business.", "NTA- you went into parent mode. You saved her from drowning and covered her up once she was safe and comfortable away from water.

You saved your daughter's life. WTF is wrong with your family, especially your wife? It must be very hard to breathe up there on that high horse. You were very brave and everyone should be grateful. Nothing perverted here, and I am speaking as a former family therapist who treated sexually abusive families-I know what perversion looks like, and this ain't it.", "NTA. What the hell??? Your daughter's life was in real danger and your wife is angry that you briefly saw her naked during her *seizure?* That's absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. I really hate the way nudity is viewed these days especially in situations like this. I have a daughter and if I wasn\u2019t immediately right there I would hope that her dad would help our daughter himself in this situation. People  for some reason like to make things creepy or gross when they aren\u2019t\u2026. \n\nIt actually makes me really upset for you that you\u2019re now getting these accusations for simply wanting to save your daughter from a potentially dangerous situation.", "Wow, NTA. Not at all.\n\nIf you, her father, shouldn\u2019t be saving her life while she is naked because it is \u2018inappropriate\u2019.. they\u2019d lose their shit over the idea that doctors and surgeons see naked people all the time, what perverts!\n\nHas she ever had a Pap smear before? /:\n\nA naked body is not inherently sexual, especially not when it\u2019s a medical issue.", "NTA You, your wife and daughter need to research SUDEP (Sudden Explained Death in Epilepsy). My nephew died as a result of a seizure 5 years ago. When an epileptic is seizing the last thing you need to worry about is modesty  I suggest you all make an appointment with her neurologist to or contact CURE to learn more.", "Uhhhh she's your daughter, you probably saved her life. At that point it doesn't matter who she is, you did the absolute right thing. \n\nI think they are telling much more about themselves than anything to do with you, and showing a possible inherent distrust of you. They would prefer risking her life... For what? \n\nOnly your daughter's opinion matters here. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nYour wife and family are ridiculous!  I\u2019m offended for you that they would take a medical emergency and turn it into something perverted/ sexual.  Has your daughter said anything about you seeing her naked?", "NTA.  Daughters survival trumps all of these other thoughtless complaints.   Wife and family clearly have no understanding for the facts of life.  They are ignorant of the medical situation and they have proven themselves assholes for all of the abuse and name calling rained on you.  Who doesn't know that survival is more important than social custom?", "NTA. She's your child for goodness sakes, and she was in very real danger of drowning. Two additional points need to be made. Is your wife strong enough to carry a grown woman out of the bathroom? Second, I'm sure your daughter is grateful for you to have come along when you did and that you acted as you did.", "NTA WHAT??????? It's your daughter and she could have DROWNED? Who has an attitude like that and for shame on your wife and everyone else involved. They all being very creepy here.", "NTA. They're the ones making it sexual for some reason. There was an emergency situation and you reacted. You could've saved your daughters life because of how you handled it. You covered her as soon as she was in a safe location. Your daughter doesn't feel weird about it, why would anyone else?\n\nYou sound like a very caring and attentive father and your daughter is lucky to have someone like you in her life to help her through this.", "NTA\n\nThe only disgusting people are your wife and FIL with their dirty minds, not the father trying to help his daughter.", " Some 35 years ago I made a friend in woodshop. She was a nice person. The only one that seemed interested in talking to me. So naturally on woodshop day in school, I would look forward to seeing her. Then one morning, she didnt come in. And everyone was acting different. Off. Turns out she was taking a bath that morning and seized. She drowned.  \n\n\nNTA. Seriously, all of your family members are pieces of crap. Seriously they have some serious issues.  All that matters is that your daughter is safe. She might not want to be taking baths without some sort of safety precautions in place. If she is good with you, then that's all that matters. I would tell all of the family members that said what I did was inappropriate that they can kick rocks and I want nothing to do with them going forward. Some people are truly disgusting.", "Good god - def NTA. Your daughter has a medical issue and you basically saved her life. Then you carry her to her room and get her clothing. Oh - and you did all that because of course all you wanted to do was ogle her. WTF is wrong with the ppl in your family???", "I mean, you\u2019re her father. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a random stranger. I understand there\u2019s privacy etc, but it was an emergency situation. Why does it sound like they don\u2019t trust you around a young girl, who\u2019s your daughter? That seems really off to me.

Seriously, what TF.", "Something is wrong with each and every one of them. \nNot you. \nHow dare they sexualize you providing EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE for your seizing daughter IN A BATH. Something is wrong with THEM,  not you. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour wife and her father are messed up prefering for your daughter to be put into danger just so that you don't carry/see her nude? It's your daughter ffs, there's nothing sexual about it. If my FIL had that reaction, I wouldn't want him near my daughter (and/or wife) by himself ever again. That seems like projecting. Red flag due to messed up views or a flag pointing to a possibly dark past of sexual abuse between your wife and FIL? Why else would the both of them share that reaction?", "So your daughter was having a medical emergency and you helped remove her from a dangerous situation and your wife has an issue with it? \n\nNTA, what does she propose you do if she had not been home, simply hold her above water indefinitely?", "NTA.\n\nYour wife sure is though. You dadreflexed and saved your daughter\u2019s life and all she is focusing on is the fact that she was nude?? \n\nSo many emergency incidents happen in the bathroom of the home.

I'm epileptic and I don't take sitting baths for this reason, I choose to shower only. Much less risk of drowning.

There are fathers out there who care for their adult disabled daughters and see them naked. Mothers who do the same for their sons. Your family has the problem not you.", "NTA. The fact that your family doesn't trust you around your daughter is concerning. Especially your wife. I'd call that a pretty big red flag. Your daughter has a dangerous condition, and this will likely not be the last time you find her in a compromising situation if you continue to take care of her through this. Frankly, the person whose opinion matters the most in this is your daughter's, so as long as she is comfortable with it, I don't see that you did anything wrong.\n\nAs for \"should have shouted for your wife immediately,\" I disagree. Having her help your nude daughter when possible is likely more appropriate. However, the immediate concern in this situation was to make sure your daughter was not in danger of drowning, which she was, and which you saved her from. If you had waited for your wife, she might have gotten a lungfull of water during the wait. That is far too steep a price in my mind.", "NTA. It was an emergency situation and you made what I would do as well if I had a daughter. In my opinion your wife is the asshole here. You are together for 19 years at least, and she does not trust you?", "NTA!!! What kind of bull crap is this! You saved her, I bet your wife wouldn't have been able to carry her to the bedroom, or pull her out of the tub. I can not believe that they would make you feel bad for saving your daughter. You are a hero and nothing less.", "NTA, you didn't want her drowning.  You wife probably would have needed your help anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou saved your daughters life, fuck \"appropriate\". How would it have been more important to just hold her while you wait for your wife when your daughter is STILL naked, instead of moving her to safety and getting her covered up? They can all get bent. How does your DAUGHTER feel about it? That's the important opinion.", "NTA.\n\nNudity shouldn\u2019t be something so taboo and sexualized.

To essentially accuse your of abusing your daughter when you were saving her freaking life is so disgusting that there just aren't words.  Some major apologies are owed to you.

You got her out of the situation and cared for her, including covering her.

I really need some outside advice to see if I was really in the wrong\n\n\nI (42M) have a 19 year old daughter with epilepsy. It was a pretty recent development and we've just now managed to get used to it and have it managed. I was downstairs one evening searching for my reading glasses when I heard her say she was going to take a bath.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of fruitless searching, I went upstairs to see if I left them up there. That's when I heard a loud noise from the bathroom, like something fell. I knocked a few times and asked if she was okay, but I didn't get a response. I waited another minute before opening the door and finding her seizing and slipping under the water. What I heard was her knocking over some of the shampoo bottles when she began to shake. Her mouth went under and I freaked out. I held her up until she stopped seizing and then pulled her out of the water entirely. The bathroom isn't very big so I carried her to her room right next door and laid her down on the floor with a pillow. I started shouting for my wife for her meds and to bring a phone in case we needed to call EMS.\u00a0\n\n\nShe was naked, so I found a robe on her floor and threw it on her. She woke up after a few minutes, confused, and we gave her the medicine. My wife and I sat with her for probably an hour while she came back to her senses. I wanted to go to the ER, but my kid is stubborn as heck and wouldn't go. After a while, we all calmed down and left her alone to get dressed and relax.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was after that, when we were going to bed, that my wife had an attitude. I asked what was wrong and she snapped. I was told that I should've shouted for her immediately when I realized what was happening. It was okay for me to have held her up in the bath, but it was inappropriate and disgusting that I carried our naked daughter to her room and that I put a robe on her without my wife being there. She said she would've handled the situation since our daughter was nude. Obviously, I panicked and I didn't think anything of it. I told her that it was my daughter in an emergency situation and that it didn't matter. It wasn't ideal for me either but it was just my kid.\u00a0\n\n\nShe told her parents and mine over the next few days and the results haven't been pretty. My wife's parents are furious and my FIL called me every name under the sun for \"looking at his granddaughter\". My MIL and my parents were more understanding, but did say that next time I should get my wife because it would be more appropriate since our daughter was naked and that seemed perverted. My daughter said that she didn't mind that I helped her instead of her mom and didn't feel weird about it, but our families have not let up.\u00a0\n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA  You acted entirely appropriately in the situation.", "NTA, your wife and her family are complete perverts though. Idk, I feel like I might be getting divorced if my wife suggested I was getting off to my epileptic daughter, or had ulterior (sexual) motives, after literally saving her fucking life. But that's just me. If your wife wanted you to wait to save her life, she's a terrible mother. I feel like something is missing from this story.", "NTA\n\nNot only is the suggestion that you did anything wrong completely insane, but I'm assuming when your wife told her parents what happened the onus was less on the fact that you saved her child's life, and more on the fact that you saw her child naked.  That they appear to have forgotten she's your child too is just baffling.     \n\nTheir reaction is just not normal.  Even your own parents' comment that it seemed perverted is ridiculous.  No wonder you're confused.  I don't even know you and I'm confused on your behalf.", "Nta, tell your wife to stop being ridiculous. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA: You saved your daughter from drowning. Why is your wife so insecure? You are a protector of your daughter. Of course, you\u2019re going to suspect something is wrong, when you hear a loud bump and she\u2019s not responding. You knew something was wrong and acted. It seems you acted on impulse. The bathroom was small, so you moved her to her room. You didn\u2019t want her hitting her head and doing further injury to herself, while convulsing.

Would your FIL have let her be in danger or would he have rescued her? Would he have looked at her 'that way'? Ask him that. What about male medical professionals? Are they perverted? I'll have to tell that to the surgeon who saved my life and the nurses who cared for me afterward. \n\nAny perversion is in the minds of those who are telling you not to care for your daughter.

And what about your wife? If it were a boy child, would she be expected to wait for your assistance so that it wasn\u2019t deemed perverted? Of course not, that\u2019s ridiculous! I\u2019m really saddened that men have to put up with the awful assumption that they\u2019re predators in public & with strangers, but to be subjected to that within your family is disgusting.\n\nI\u2019m pleased that your daughter is with you on this. I honestly think that this is a hill to die on \u2026 both for you and your daughter (and any other children you have).

I don\u2019t see what your wife had to gain from this other than to rally to troops to pile on your further. If your daughter is 19 I can only assume that you\u2019ve been together a long time. This is such a betrayal and I feel gutted for you.", "NTA. As a 23yo woman, I don\u2019t care who\u2019s pulling me out of the water. Mom, dad, MIL, FIL, BIL, the neighbor, a hamster, just get me out. You put a robe on her, and in no way was this situation sexual AT ALL. You saved her life. \n\nTalk to your daughter. Ask her if it made her uncomfortable, and if it were to happen again, if she\u2019d prefer you to wait for her mother or EMS. If she needs an apology, give her one, but however she feels about the situation matters most. Then relay the game plan to your wife. Daughter doesn\u2019t care who pulls her out? It\u2019s not your wife\u2019s problem or right to be angry. Jesus. I could not imagine being angry with my husband saving my daughter in any circumstance. Or anyone for that matter. Just help my child. Good grief.", "NTA.\n\nI think it\u2019s disgusting that your family thinks of this situation as perverted instead of life-saving.

If anyone, regardless who they are to me, was seizing in the water like you described, I would do the same thing.

If your wife and her parents are seriously thinking you were inappropriately looking at your daughter when she was having a seizure they are disgusting.  You moved your daughter from an unsafe environment where she could have drowned in the bath to a safer environment where you could monitor her and you covered her as soon as you could.

Your daughter did not mind and that's really the only person's opinion that matters.

It's not like you let yourself in to ogle her body like your wife and FIL are making out?! And I'm sure in this situation you didn't even have time to think about the fact that she was nude/look at her body anyway because you'd have been more focused on keeping her head above the water... I seriously can't see the problem, or where you'd even have had the time to see much of her body, even then, it's a body. We've all got one. Nothing necessarily sexual about it. Especially when it's your daughter in a medical emergency.

I say this as an American.", "I wish I could upvote this a million times", ">Seriously, we as a society need to get over this hang-up over seeing other people nude -\n\nSeeing our own children nude while doing our jobs as parents. \n\nI mean wtf? This is his child who it doesn't indicate she was ever upset about this. He even covered her as soon as it was safe to do so. \n\nJust seriously what and I cannot stress this enough in the actual fuck is wrong with people?", "In iambic pentameter", "Interesting enough, I wonder if the mother is more upset that she wasn\u2019t the hero\u2026", "It's a bloody damned if you do damned if you don't. If you don't, you're a deadbeat, if you do, you're a pervert. The stories I've heard of people calling the police on fathers taking their kids to the park has made me lose all hope in society.", "Fear of sexual deviancy has obliterated male role models in children too. The percentage of male teachers in US public schooling? 3%.", "Exactly! He was saving his daughter's life. There is nothing sexual about seeing a child naked, adult or not.", "yeah unless OP has a pervy history you\u2019re probably right. It\u2019s such an extreme reaction for an entire family to have", "The problem with a seat is the person is likely to fall off during a seizure, and is then it's in the way for them to hit while seizing and makes it harder for someone to take get them out. It could cause more harm then good", "Depends on the type of seizure and how long the person has been experiencing them. With proper medication, some epileptics can feel \"off\" before a seizure hits, and ideally you want them to be familiar enough with their condition and body that they might be able to identify warning signs of an upcoming seizure. However, some simply can't and this is when service dogs can be very useful as they can alert ahead of time so the person can get to a safe area.", "Symptoms are different in different people, and not all seizures are alike. It\u2019s worth her asking her doctor.", "Oh yeah, very good point.", "When I worked in palliative care this was a reasonably common occurrence. Lots of elderly ladies with fungating tumours, also a lot of prolapsed uteruses. Shame is a killer.", "Sounds like wifes father also has issues. Maybe OP should be asking him why??", "You never heard someone say the dad shouldn\u2019t bathe or change or clean their baby daughter? The first time I heard that wow. \ud83d\ude24", "His wife and in-laws seem the kind of people who would've berated him for feeling sad that he lost his daughter had he actually waited. They're absolutely disgusting people to the core", "Thank you. That was random.", "And that is a HUGE problem.\n\nI spent years fighting to get my son a male aide.  The women were teaching him to greet people with hugs or kisses.  Absolutely not appropriate.  He had never seen a urinal.  I couldn't take him to the men's room.  Family bathrooms don't have them.  He had no male role model at home.  \n\nThings changed for him when I was finally successful.  The contrasting point of view also helped me see things for my son differently.", "And the sounds\u2026 the sounds are the worst part for a bystander, imo. (My sister has epilepsy, and holy shit, the sounds she makes when she\u2019s having a seizure\u2026 it gives me chills just thinking about it)", "These things can be complicated. People forgive their abusers, abusers gaslight bystanders to divert attention, maybe FIL got the story second-hand... But it feels more likely that she learned this hang-up from her parents.", "I was at a female relative's house with my daughter  who was still getting the hang of potty training and wiping properly after #2. She went to the bathroom and when she was done, she yelled out \"dad can you come wipe me please\". The relative jumped up to go do it... and i stopped her. She tried to argue that it was weird for me to do it because I'm a guy. Nevermind this was the 2nd time my daughter had met this woman so which would have been weirder?", "My husband collapsed in the shower once. The thud was so loud and I ran to the bathroom. His eyes were rolling back and he was unresponsive. It was terrifying. The first thing I did was pull him out of the shower (which, afterward, I probably shouldn't have, but I was just doing what seemed right in the moment). The next thing I did was try to see if I could get a response. The third thing I did was scream for help and for someone to call 911. About the 8th thing I did was cover him up. \n\nWhen someone you love is in danger, you aren't thinking about them being naked. You just want to get to them and get them help. It is really only after things normalize that you remember they are naked. \n\n(Husband is fine. Turned out to be a vasovagal syncope. But every time he drops the soap in the shower, I feel a grip of panic. And this was more than 10 years ago.)", "And what if she wasn\u2019t home? Just wait there holding her up in the water for a few hours?", "Truly. The wife doesn\u2019t sound like the type to sprint to a call for help on the first attempt.  Could have been a minute or more.  Than when she gets there another 30 seconds to a minute to determine what to do.  All that on top of the time it took for the dad to react.\n\nThis is pure craziness.", "this is where my brain went as well...", "I just said this ! Why are they making something totally innocent gross?", "Dude, good point. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.", "I've replied with similar sentiment. I'm glad I'm not the only one concerned about this. Even if it wasn't the father-in-law, somebody in that family likely suffered sexual abuse from a relative or someone in a caretaking position.", "I admit, that thought has crossed my mind.", "Yes!!! This never gets talked about. The first time my partner had one it was in the middle of the night and I woke up to him screaming bloody murder. I was terrified. I also didn't realize seizures can sometimes induce an almost hallucinatory state. He would jump up from the seizure and make the craziest sounds I've ever heard. I was always terrified it would happen and a police officer wouldn't realize what was occuring and tase him (or worse).", "This is life goals right here. \n\nI may or may not have giggled at the thought of \"dropping the soap\" having a whole different scary meaning for you than the usual one that comes up with that phrase. I know it's not funny that it makes you panic but I try to find the humor in things to make me feel better. That was the first thing I thought of sorry.", "My daughter has two dads. I guess she'll just have to drown.\n\nNTA. Sorry, OP, your wife is a monster and her opinion of you is embarrassingly and insultingly wrong. She and her dad need to apologize. They are gross.", "Which I imagine is one of her favorite lines!", "She either never heard the items drop or the commotion of dad getting kid out of the bath or she heard it and didn't check. So....", "Right? FIL assumed a father of a girl (which he also is) would be checking his child out instead of being concerned during a medical crises. Something is wrong with them to even think a father could view their child that way ever.", "The sounds my sister makes are like the sounds of the creepy kid from the grudge. It\u2019s haunting.", "According to OP's wife neither her or the daughter could help, it'd be gross and disgusting. They'd have to call the closest male neighbour for help. I see OP's wife like Ivan Drago in Rocky IV: \"If he dies, he dies.\""]}
