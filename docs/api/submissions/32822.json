His older brother is married with 3 kids.\n\nA couple months before we had our first born, his brother cut off his family. Basically cut off his parents. He did this because the kids weren\u2019t being \u201cdisciplined\u201d properly by my inlaws while bil and his wife were working. He wanted them (4 and 6) to do chores during the week and them to be punished if they weren\u2019t listening. My mil and fil did not feel comfortable punishing the kids and would just simply tell them no and redirect. They had been watching the kids most of their life for 40+ hours a week. Lots of overnight stays as the kids parents were moving to a new house.\n\nSo my BIL took the kids away and let the other set of grandparents watch them all day to show them \u201chow to be productive\u201d. It has since been a year and a half since they left and have only made a handful of family appearances but not the kids or the wife just my bil. \n\nWell they randomly announce they had their third son and need someone to watch him when they go back to work. So acting like nothing has happened, the bil is asking his parents if they could potentially watch him. He is also taking all their Christmas presents from last year that his parents had saved. He is really trying to get all he can get from his parents, and his parents are just eating this up because they can finally see the grandkids! The rest of the family can see he is lying and using them to get free daycare for the new baby. \n\nWe have all told them BIL is just going to do this all over again when the baby gets school age. My husband and I  are still upset that they haven\u2019t come to see our now 18 month old at all yet. They also spread lies to family saying we weren\u2019t allowing them to see the baby etc. it really hurt our feelings because we were there for them when they had their first two kids. \n\nHis parents invited them to Thanksgiving, and they didn\u2019t come. They now are saying they might come to Christmas. Again my mil and fil are accepting them like nothing ever happened. They are buying his family presents and giving them money to make up for the lost birthdays and holidays. Meanwhile my husband and I have gone to see them almost every week because they were so heart broken over losing their other grandchildren. \n\nSo with all this said my husband and I just want an apology from them to their parents. We also want an apology to us for ignoring our first child and for spreading lies to the family. If they could just apologize we would be okay with them coming back. They are telling everyone just to act like nothing happened. \n\nMil and fil have invited them to Christmas and we told them if they come we are not. We also said if she watches their baby without getting an apology or some kind of resolution that we won\u2019t be coming around anymore because we won\u2019t let our child be around toxic behavior. \n\nAll MIL can say it\u2019s her son she has to accept him back.

You are in no position to demand apologies.", "YTA...Not for the first part, you're allowed to attend and not attend whatever you want.  However, not allowing your child to be around them if they don't demand an apology?  Ridiculous. That's none of your business.  Your demands are adding to the toxicity.", "Info: did the BIL spread the lies, or your husbands parents? \n\nThere is one point which bring me to say YTA: your MIL and FIL are grown up adults. You can say what you want and voice your opinion, but dont make them choose. Just say \"we will only visit you when BIL is not there, including the holidays\" and be done with it. There are conflicts in the family, with these kind of ultimatum, you are stirring the pot instead of navigating yourself out of the drama. You will never get any apology from manipulative BIL, and your parents in-law will always be at an unconfortable in-between-place. Just draw the line and communicate it to grandma and grandpa and be done with it. Dont add more drama on top of it.", "I have found that sometimes, for the sake of family harmony, we must swallow our pride and accept that people suck.

Some just a little but because they are bring prideful and some a whole big bunch because they are bring users and emotionally abusive to their elders.\n\nFor you, OP, I think it's best for the sake of the parents to perpetuate family harmony. It's what the parents probably want.\n\nI'm going to get a metric ton of downvotes for this, but I believe that holding a grudge doesn't do anyone any good here.", "YTA for telling grown adults what to do in their relationships, especially when there's so much dysfunction in this extended family.  What you want wouldn't resolve any of it, it would only increase it.  \n\n\nYour emotions are your business.  If you are having feels about your in laws relationship with their son's family, that's your issue.    \n\n\nIf it is any consolation, the BIL is the biggest AH in this mess.   The BIL sucks, but you shouldn't let that bring down your relationship with your in laws.", "Don't do that to your MIL and FIL. The others treated them horribly, and you issueing an ultimatum is treating them horribly. Everybody needs to stop hurting the grandparents here.

You don't want your children to think that enabling the BIL's bad behavior is how people should act when confronted with such. \n\nThen you have to consider what sort of bad behavior on part of your children would your ILs then enable by accepting it.

Thank you for your perspective", "No, he has not. In fact he will not call or text or speak in person to us or his sister because he thinks we are all against him. That is what he told his parents at least.", "Uhh sounds like he  might be having some kind of mental health crisis if he's not normally like that, but man I would be doing everything I could to minimize my interaction with him.
