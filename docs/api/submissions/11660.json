But the booking process took a while. Plus it was pretty costly.\n\nWell, we are leaving in a week and I have created a set of rules for the trip. For example, no sleeping in past 8 a.m. (rope dropping ), wear sneakers only (due to a lot of walking), etc.\n\nI sent my sisters this list today so they could know what to expect. They didn\u2019t take it too well and said that I was being very overdramatic and that this wasn\u2019t needed. I told them that this definitely was needed to get the best experience out of Disney world. We got into an argument over it and now they are saying they no longer want to go on the trip.\n\nI thought that making this list of rules would make things easier for everyone and make it a more enjoyable time, but maybe I was being a bit dramatic, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678148764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kjejy/aita_for_making_a_set_list_of_rules_for_a_disney/", "score": 5946, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You will not need to rope drop every day. You'll also want to enjoy evenings at each park. It's a marathon not a sprint- you have tons of time.\n\nAlso for perspective- to rope drop you probably need to be at security by 7:30 which means leave your hotel by 7 which means 6am alarm. That is not doable daily.", "YTA. Your sisters are presumably not children. They can make their own decisions about what shoes to wear and if they want to sleep in while on *vacation*, they are perfectly entitled to do so.

How old are you all? If you're old enough to go to Disney alone, you're old enough to take care of yourselves. 10 days of waking up at 8 AM and doing Disney all day sounds horrendous.

No, not even remotely necessary. \nGo one day on your own if that\u2019s a must for you, but don\u2019t demand others make rope drop. \n\n\nSuggesting good walking shoes is smart. Demanding them is an AH move. \n\n\nWhen it comes to making sure everyone has a good time at Disney it\u2019s best to let each person have a \u201cmust do\u201d item.

One each and the other friends kinda suck it up and join in on that ONE thing.

Are you guys down for that? \n\nBut you booked a vacation and told grown adults that they can\u2019t sleep in and will be on their feet all day in lines so they have to wear approved footwear. To be honest, that doesn\u2019t sound fun to everyone. You really should have checked or booked and said you plan to get up at 8 am and if they don\u2019t want to, to arrange a time/place to meet each day.

I plan the Disney trip for my extended family. If you want to do everything, you need to be disciplined and scheduled. Your sisters may not care about doing everything. That\u2019s totally fine and probably, normal. I don\u2019t know though because I\u2019m not normal. \n\nThis is how I handle a family that does Disney differently than I do. I tell my family what I have scheduled each day, which is based on the attractions and dinner reservations they requested (and I am the appointed trip planner). I am happy to go with them, I *want* to go with them but if they aren\u2019t interested in the daytime schedule, I do it myself and we do restaurants and night shows together.

Having to be up early all or most days to maximize time at an overcrowded park and having a plan.

You\u2019re absolutely drained from the sun, walking around all day, and probably from whatever life / job you\u2019re taking a vacation from. 10 days is a lot of time to cover all of Disney World, it\u2019s various parks and Orlando\u2019s other attractions. \n\nMaybe have a conversation before the three of you go and explain you\u2019re excited about the trip, want to make the most of your time but remember this is about spending time with your siblings before your personal wants.

Planning the trip doesn't give you power over their clothing choices and you need to find a compromise on when you want to wake up.

I'd understand the 8am thing if you were only going for 3 days but you're there for 10 days so it's excessive to expect adults to not enjoy a lie-in on vacation. Your \"rules\" are spoiling the mood.

Perhaps you can head off early and keep your phone with you, let your sisters lie-in and meet you at a specific location in the parks once they arrive themselves?", "YTA.  The second you got to plan the trip you made a list of rules and treated them like children who don't know how to behave and are too stupid to figure out how to dress themselves.  Also, this is supposed to be their vacation too, not just yours.  It's 10 days, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be the end of the world if one of them slept in until 8:30 on one of those 10 days.

I\u2019m guessing you all have cell phones and working brains. You can head out to the park at 8am and do whatever the heck it is that prevents you from sleeping in and they can catch up with you. The only thing you have done is make it clear that you plan to be insufferable on this trip. You are going to be there for TEN DAYS. That is enough time to explore the park at your leisure. Send your sisters a message apologizing for letting your Disney Adult Excitement get the best of you, tell them the evil witch\u2019s spell has been lifted and they can prick their fingers on spinning wheels and wear glass slippers if they want since it\u2019s their vacation to do what they want with.", "YTA, are they 12?", "YTA.

At 10 days, you can stay the majoirty of it in bed even.", "Yeah YTA I get it you want to make the most but 10days waking up super early will not be a fun trip. At least one or two days should be a more relaxed spending it either at your hotel if staying on property or exploring Disney springs. \n\nOnly sneakers? I get being comfortable but there are other non sneaker shoes, I\u2019m a Disneyland annual pass holder and have been comfy in boots and ballet pumps, even worn ballet pumps in Disney world. \n\nIf you want to wake up for rope drop every day then you do that but let your sister go in later if they want.", "holy shit, if someone told mnem I couldn't sleep past 8am on my VACATION, I wouldn't want to go either.

I\u2019m sure that some days you can do things like the rope drop and some days people can sleep in and just do things at their leisure.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been on enough vacation me to know that everyone wants to do them differently.  I\u2019m a planner too and try to schedule everything but I usually pay for it after a while when I realize for whatever reason it\u2019s not going to be possible.  Then it\u2019s time to sit everyone down and decide what\u2019s most import to everyone and plan around those things.  I\u2019m sure compromise will solve everything.", "NTA.

We make it a point to do pretty much *everything* everyone wants to do. We have *never* had to be at any park at rope drop to do so in any of the times we\u2019ve gone, and if we ever got there during the early magic hours it was because we had specific plans (breakfast reservation, getting to Galaxy\u2019s Edge before ride lines got long).

If you miss out on something, you can always go back at some point. \n\nSome years back when I took me, husband, son, and niece, I told everyone to do a little research and for each park pick the One Thing I Must Do Or I Shall Die, and we'd make those the priority, and everything else was gravy.

You can make recommendations, like recommending they bring sneakers for days with lots of walking, but dictating what they can and can\u2019t do on a vacation kinda defeats the whole point.

Im spending close to 15k on this trip, I\u2019m not gonna waste my time. For most people this is a once in a lifetime trip, no one wants to hear people whine about sore feet or miss a bunch of rides because they didn\u2019t get there early enough. \n\nOn the other side they kinda suck since you\u2019ve said you\u2019re paying for it and aren\u2019t bothering to even listen to why you need these rules.

How much did you pay to go on those 5 rides?", "You wasted your $.", "Think about that for a minute. You were there for 8 hours and rode 5 rides. Even taking into account walking time, that\u2019s more than an hour in line per ride. \n\nAnd yeah, Spring Break is a madhouse now: all the hotel prices are significantly higher - like 50% more, if not higher, than the week before or after - and crowds, before the park reservation system was implemented were among the busiest all year, it\u2019s a blackout date period for all but the highest tier Annual Passholder (and individual day tickets have high surge pricing in them), the same as the week from Christmas Eve to New Year\u2019s Day. \n\nDisney World is not like that any more.", "Unfortunately add the price increases etc and you basically have to have a drill Sargent plan laid out if you want to do anything\u2026anyone I know whose been in the last year or so has had to preplan like crazy", ">Stayed til 7 and went on at least 5 rides.\n\nPeople aren't unironically thinking that going on 5 rides over the course of 8 hours is a good time, are they?\n\nJeez, I'll stick with Vienna's Prater.

I would be crying at that.\n\nWhich is why savvy people get to the park a little before opening, and riding many rides before others show up. (Those that 'ahem' arrive at 11.) Then when others are still coming through the gates, you're ready for lunch at 11 before the food services get crowded. When others are eating lunch, you're hitting the rides or a parade, then leaving the park about 1:00. \n\nBack to the hotel for a dip in the pool and a nap, then eat a light dinner at the resort and back to the park about 5 PM.  As you arrive, note the families who tried to stay all day (after arriving 'late') as they make their way out of the park, kids squalling from no naps, and parents ready to commit ritual hara kiri. Here you are, fresh as a daisy, and ready to have fun until they kick you out at park closing. \n\nDisney is an expensive vacation that requires planning and teamwork to fully get the most of.

I walked onto FOP more than once on a Sunday.

Then you do whatever else you want in that 40 minutes and pop in the line at the scheduled time for a short wait. I don't know the exact timings but I remember it only helping a bit.

Just came back from Disney on a sister trip December 2022 and let me tell you NTA. \n\nSure you could bend it if you want that you are going at rope drop but they can come later in the day but this truly isn't too unreasonable when it comes to the days you're visiting the parks. It's packed at all times of day, and the line wait times are killer if you don't have Genie+ or dash pass (we only got it because a friend of mine worked there). The parks are hilly due to the structures underneath and the sitting accommodations are sparce. If you can find wiggle room in the rules great. I'd market it as advice and the itinerary.

Once you account for sitting to rest, and / or meals, not to mention shopping, that doesn\u2019t leave a high number of rides. \n\nAnd there\u2019s a *lot* of walking.

If they want to sleep in then have a compromise of meeting up later.  Explain why you think the shoes portion is important, but don't make it a rule.

I am very local to Disney and even WE don\u2019t find it as nice anymore.  There are no slow times. You must plan.  It is set up to reward those with the most cash and is not an affordable family vacation for the average person anymore ( honestly, we like vacationing at Dollywood better!).  \n\nIf I were OP I would tell the others what I know.  Encourage early wake ups but not demand. \n\nMaybe set a tentative schedule with 3-4 days out of the 10 well planned for early wake ups for the high demand experiences / rides.  I would also leave 3 days at least completely open ended for sleeping in, pool time at the resort, maybe casually hitting lesser known Orlando attractions ( Gatorland anyone?).  Or even just sleep in, get a nice lunch experience at a nicer restaurant and then hit a park just for the fireworks.  Then the last few days for other theme parks ( Universal or SeaWorld\u2026 probably wanna dodge Legoland on an adult trip). \n\nThat way you get a few hyper planned early days and everybody else doesn\u2019t feel as if they have been drafted into the Disney adult army. You can\u2019t go balls to the wall, park open to park close every day.  You gotta intersperse it with relaxation time.  Maybe get yourself some treatments at the Grand Floridian Spa.\n\nForgot to add : Soft YTA.    You can plan, but for goodness sake have consideration for the others.  There is a way to do this.", "Yep, I do Disney this way (get there early- do as much as possible before lines get too long). This was disneyland, but I had some friends meeting me there- whom I advised to just get one park and not park hopper for the day, but they insisted- that I warned them to get it all in they would need to be there right when it opened and had a plan. I call them morning of, and they were just sitting down at Denny's to eat breakfast. I just went in and did like 6 rides before they even got there. They were not able to do all the rides they wanted.  I don't understand paying that kind of money to not maximize time- but they are adults and everyone is different. you can only control what you do.", "The catch is that it's usually most crowded then so you can optimize your time and hit the most rides early then stack lightning lanes for your return, then the lines die down again after the evening shows.  It's much better to rest mid day then miss the evening at the park IMO. Unless you want to go 8am to midnight, you gotta pick some hours to miss, so I pick the most crowded and hottest (at DW, at least).", "What's a rope drop?", "It's miserable if you plan it like that.\n\nI've done it unplanned, and it is less stressful and still fun.", "I feel like we'll be lucky if we take our kids once or twice. It's a lot of money and quite the hassle. We really hate big crowds and spending lots of money lol! Of course our kids are four years apart so trying to decide when to go is difficult. We want the youngest to be able to remember it and the oldest to be young enough to still really love it. Luckily the Star Wars stuff will still be enjoyable for the oldest when we make it. But the expense and the prospect of waiting in lines all day really makes us keep postponing Disney World... You bet we'll be waking up early every morning when we have tickets for DW, maybe we can sleep in on the universal days! But I wouldn't deem to dictate when a group of adults wakes up or what they wear on vacay. I wouldn't go with people unless they also wanted to make the most of it. Park days are full days and then we'll plan more relaxing days before and after our park days.", "Nah. I live right next to Disney and this isn't true.\n\nIt's totally depends on what day and time of year you go. If you go during winter, spring break, and first half of summer, its gonna be packed, especially weekends. But there are good days to go where say, a ride like everest takes only 30 minutes to get on. You just usually have to go on a weekday to get short times.\n\nAlso you should have done a little research before going. Flight of Passage is Disney's most popular ride right now. It's had a 3 hour line wait (weekends) for like 4 years now. It's nothing new. I waited 6 hours when it first opened.. you probably should have gotten in line for that AFTER the safari.. they won't kick you out of line when that park closes.\n\nRope dropping in my expirence doesn't make a huge difference. It only works for one right. After like an hour after opening, the lines become long. Me and my friends stopped rope dropping because it was pointless.\n\nSo I'm going to say op is TA because both obviously don't care about rope dropping, and going for the rope dropping doesn't make a huge difference anymore. Even if it does, when you force non morning people to wake up early, you wont get a good experience out of it. No need to make rules like they're children. I guarantee they can fit in all the rides they want if they're arrived at 11am. How do I know? Because I do it all the time.", "The Genie pass is only $20 per person to add to a ticket but it completely changes your whole day.

I think you have to plan it out if you\u2019re going to maximize both your money\u2019s worth and the amount of fun. \n\nBut even I\u2019m not making my friend wake up before 8am every day.

Woof.\n\nI'm sorry you had the parks ruined for you in such a way. I'd never go back, either. What a nightmare.", "Does it matter though. Their sisters aren't children. If they want to flip flops, let them. Policing people and what they wear is weird.", "That really says a lot about the location if the only way to truly enjoy it is to get there super early.. it\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s a beautiful place in nature, but if it is a capitalist nightmare, and it cost out the nose to be there?

The lines weren't too bad, so there was very little waiting.", "I think OP is gung-ho about doing everything at the parks (no sleeping in, going at 8am when parks open, comfortable shoes) and if her sisters wear fashionable shoes that aren\u2019t comfortable to stand after 12 hours a day they\u2019ll want to quit early each day. \n\nThat\u2019s like another sister planning a hiking trip and the others want to wear platform boots. They\u2019re going to cut the hikes short and ruin the \u201cplans\u201d. Wearing reasonable shoes aren\u2019t policing people.

And that's okay! It's just a case of managing your expectations of what you think your sisters want from this trip.  \nThey may not be that invested in Disney or the park, or not as much as you are. Getting the maximum value out of the park in terms of rides, rope drops etc. may not matter to them- they may just want to be able to unwind, experience the atmosphere, ride a few rides. Mostly, they may want to just have a trip with you, and be able to relax and enjoy a nice two weeks with all three of you, and be able to look back on the trip with a sense of joy and happiness.  \n\nIf you have things you want to do at the park, absolutely go for it. But definitely don't expect your sisters to join in on every part of it, especially not the early morning events/repeated ones. Invite them along without pressure, or let them know some of your plans (\"I'm going to be doing the rope drop on these days if you'd like to come!\") and arrange to meet up after for coffee or breakfast/lunch.  \nHave the experience you want, but let them have the experience they want, too.

His feet dried out immediately and he never got blister..", "Try the Clark's brand of sandals. I use those when cruising and they are comfy. Those and my crocs.", "It's where you get there before the park opens to one of the very first people in line.  Don't know if they still do, but they used to have an actual rope to hold people back until  it was time.", "I really wanna upvote for the Clark\u2019s suggestion, they\u2019re amazing, but I also wanna downvote so so badly for the Crocs.", "Yikes. Thank you, I'm not a Disney person.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 \nWell, my crocs don't make my feet smell if I'm sweating in them for a long period of time, like the Clark's do.", "IMO the best time to go was 10 years ago. It's become increasingly difficult to have some kind of flexibility in your day while also being able to hit the rides you want. FastPass used to be free, now there's various tiers for it AND you have to pay? \\*shakes cane\\* \n\nThat being said, there's still a lot you can do that involves minimal waiting in line. Some of the best parts of Disney are the hidden gems you stumble upon when you least expect it.", "ugh like \"Gifted/gifting\" as a verb. Drives me spare, but it's here to stay.", "This is it exactly! My wife and I are pretty laid back travelers. We pick a couple things where we\u2019re required to be there (ticketed events, reservations), then have a list of things we\u2019d like to do just so we know the options, but aside from our required events, we go with the flow and leave space for slow starts, meeting locals and spontaneity.\n\nWe were going to Europe awhile back at the same time as our close friends. They wanted to travel our UK leg together but when they presented us an itinerary that was timed to the minute. We told them, don\u2019t expect us to follow this and we might do a couple of these things together, but it\u2019s the antithesis of our travel style. \n\nThere were some things we were going to do no matter what that they didn\u2019t want to. Ok, no big deal for us, we can meet later. They were upset at first until we told them, they could do whatever they wanted and to not let us hold them back as we would do the same. It\u2019s just weird to me that people take offense that you have different interests at times and don\u2019t have to spend every second together. We kept saying, we\u2019re giving you the opportunity to have the trip you want and we\u2019re not upset at all about it, we just know the trip we want too.", "I just wander off haha. Everyone knows I'll be back so I go do my own things. Especially abroad when everyone just wants to see tourist traps.", "Op, YTA. A list of rules on vacation. Screw that. Rope drop is meaningless now with early hours. I will have ridden several rides by the time rope drop happens.\nHave become a capitalist nightmare? Hahaha. The \"magic\" disappeared in the 1980's, if it ever had it. The last 2 trips I planned to Disney, spouse plans everything usually, had no plan and went way smoother than our \"planned\" trips.\nEdit; clarity and fast fingers.", "OK, I love Disneyland/Disney World (I was just at Disneyland last weekend), but this made me laugh."]}
