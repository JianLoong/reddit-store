But the booking process took a while. Plus it was pretty costly.\n\nWell, we are leaving in a week and I have created a set of rules for the trip. For example, no sleeping in past 8 a.m. (rope dropping ), wear sneakers only (due to a lot of walking), etc.\n\nI sent my sisters this list today so they could know what to expect. They didn\u2019t take it too well and said that I was being very overdramatic and that this wasn\u2019t needed. I told them that this definitely was needed to get the best experience out of Disney world. We got into an argument over it and now they are saying they no longer want to go on the trip.\n\nI thought that making this list of rules would make things easier for everyone and make it a more enjoyable time, but maybe I was being a bit dramatic, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678148764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kjejy/aita_for_making_a_set_list_of_rules_for_a_disney/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You will not need to rope drop every day. You'll also want to enjoy evenings at each park. It's a marathon not a sprint- you have tons of time.\n\nAlso for perspective- to rope drop you probably need to be at security by 7:30 which means leave your hotel by 7 which means 6am alarm. That is not doable daily.", "YTA. Your sisters are presumably not children. They can make their own decisions about what shoes to wear and if they want to sleep in while on *vacation*, they are perfectly entitled to do so.

How old are you all? If you're old enough to go to Disney alone, you're old enough to take care of yourselves. 10 days of waking up at 8 AM and doing Disney all day sounds horrendous.

Are you guys down for that? \n\nBut you booked a vacation and told grown adults that they can\u2019t sleep in and will be on their feet all day in lines so they have to wear approved footwear. To be honest, that doesn\u2019t sound fun to everyone. You really should have checked or booked and said you plan to get up at 8 am and if they don\u2019t want to, to arrange a time/place to meet each day.

I plan the Disney trip for my extended family. If you want to do everything, you need to be disciplined and scheduled. Your sisters may not care about doing everything. That\u2019s totally fine and probably, normal. I don\u2019t know though because I\u2019m not normal. \n\nThis is how I handle a family that does Disney differently than I do. I tell my family what I have scheduled each day, which is based on the attractions and dinner reservations they requested (and I am the appointed trip planner). I am happy to go with them, I *want* to go with them but if they aren\u2019t interested in the daytime schedule, I do it myself and we do restaurants and night shows together.

Having to be up early all or most days to maximize time at an overcrowded park and having a plan.

You\u2019re absolutely drained from the sun, walking around all day, and probably from whatever life / job you\u2019re taking a vacation from. 10 days is a lot of time to cover all of Disney World, it\u2019s various parks and Orlando\u2019s other attractions. \n\nMaybe have a conversation before the three of you go and explain you\u2019re excited about the trip, want to make the most of your time but remember this is about spending time with your siblings before your personal wants.

Planning the trip doesn't give you power over their clothing choices and you need to find a compromise on when you want to wake up.

I'd understand the 8am thing if you were only going for 3 days but you're there for 10 days so it's excessive to expect adults to not enjoy a lie-in on vacation. Your \"rules\" are spoiling the mood.

Perhaps you can head off early and keep your phone with you, let your sisters lie-in and meet you at a specific location in the parks once they arrive themselves?", "YTA.  The second you got to plan the trip you made a list of rules and treated them like children who don't know how to behave and are too stupid to figure out how to dress themselves.

I\u2019m guessing you all have cell phones and working brains. You can head out to the park at 8am and do whatever the heck it is that prevents you from sleeping in and they can catch up with you. The only thing you have done is make it clear that you plan to be insufferable on this trip. You are going to be there for TEN DAYS. That is enough time to explore the park at your leisure. Send your sisters a message apologizing for letting your Disney Adult Excitement get the best of you, tell them the evil witch\u2019s spell has been lifted and they can prick their fingers on spinning wheels and wear glass slippers if they want since it\u2019s their vacation to do what they want with.", "YTA, are they 12?", "YTA.

At 10 days, you can stay the majoirty of it in bed even.", "Yeah YTA I get it you want to make the most but 10days waking up super early will not be a fun trip. At least one or two days should be a more relaxed spending it either at your hotel if staying on property or exploring Disney springs. \n\nOnly sneakers? I get being comfortable but there are other non sneaker shoes, I\u2019m a Disneyland annual pass holder and have been comfy in boots and ballet pumps, even worn ballet pumps in Disney world. \n\nIf you want to wake up for rope drop every day then you do that but let your sister go in later if they want.", "holy shit, if someone told mnem I couldn't sleep past 8am on my VACATION, I wouldn't want to go either.

You shouldn\u2019t set rules for adults on vacation for what you think is best.

I\u2019m sure that some days you can do things like the rope drop and some days people can sleep in and just do things at their leisure.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been on enough vacation me to know that everyone wants to do them differently.  I\u2019m a planner too and try to schedule everything but I usually pay for it after a while when I realize for whatever reason it\u2019s not going to be possible.  Then it\u2019s time to sit everyone down and decide what\u2019s most import to everyone and plan around those things.  I\u2019m sure compromise will solve everything.", "NTA. Everyone saying YTA is seeming to skip over the fact that is is a Disney world trip.", "YTA. Look. I enjoy Disney. I was just there with my sister a couple months ago. We make it a point to do pretty much *everything* everyone wants to do. We have *never* had to be at any park at rope drop to do so in any of the times we\u2019ve gone, and if we ever got there during the early magic hours it was because we had specific plans (breakfast reservation, getting to Galaxy\u2019s Edge before ride lines got long).

They are just going to piss everyone off. This is a vacation. It\u2019s supposed to be fun. You are trying to unilaterally dictate everyone\u2019s clothing, mood (\u201cno negativity\u201d), and agenda.

If you want so many restrictions and rules, maybe you need to take the trip by yourself.", "You made a list of rules that suited only you, not all of you together.  That really is a group discussion.  And this is a VACATION.  One they are paying for as well, so they will go for what they want to go for to enjoy the VACATION.

I\u2019m like you, and I can tell you if you try going two or three days in a row from open to close, it really burns you out, even for someone like us.  A lot of people find a good balance by alternating between hard and light days.  Also in ten days you will have done every ride easily (unless you have no strategy).

If you miss out on something, you can always go back at some point. \n\nSome years back when I took me, husband, son, and niece, I told everyone to do a little research and for each park pick the One Thing I Must Do Or I Shall Die, and we'd make those the priority, and everything else was gravy.

I'm a rope-dropper all the way, no effing way am I sleeping in but that doesn't mean everyone else has to get up with me. You're killing the vibe for this trip.

You can make recommendations, like recommending they bring sneakers for days with lots of walking, but dictating what they can and can\u2019t do on a vacation kinda defeats the whole point.

Im spending close to 15k on this trip, I\u2019m not gonna waste my time. For most people this is a once in a lifetime trip, no one wants to hear people whine about sore feet or miss a bunch of rides because they didn\u2019t get there early enough. \n\nOn the other side they kinda suck since you\u2019ve said you\u2019re paying for it and aren\u2019t bothering to even listen to why you need these rules.

At least that\u2019s how it comes across.", "Oof I picked the wrong field lol. Honestly, I\u2019m with you in that your rules are the best way to do Disney, but maybe your sisters don\u2019t care as much. If they\u2019re adults you probably can\u2019t dictate what they do/don\u2019t do.

However, even the four parks of Disney can be fully experienced in max five days? That leaves plenty of wiggle room for the siblings to sleep in and join later or hang out by the pool and have a character meal at the hotel (assuming it\u2019s on property) instead. \n\nSource: I\u2019m from that area in FL and multiple friends have worked for the mouse.

Would much rather spend my vacations laying on a beach even if it's a little crowded then standing in line.", "Yeah, when I visited Animal Kingdom I arrived at 6:45am.

To me doing 10 days is just insane to also try to open and close the parks. \n\nMy BIL and his gf could only afford to do 2 days in parks so they did park hoppers and opened and closed the park each day. Did everything they wanted to. This trip is bonkers.", "When did you go? I went to Disneyland in 2022 and I wouldn\u2019t describe it as chaos.

They\u2019ve just gotten so crowded and expensive it\u2019s just not worth it. \n\nYou can get a VIP tour that\u2019s pricey and get cuts. Or stay in the hotel and get a magic hour in one park.

Of course people are entitled to make rules.  The only dispute here is whether OP is entitled to make them for this vacay, and whether the ones she made are reasonable, and that\u2019s entirely between her and her sisters.  There\u2019s nothing onerous about making a rule: we do it all the time, and that\u2019s my point.  Whether we have the right to, and whether our rules are reasonable, is a separate matter.

It was very crowded and even with the Genie thing it was kind of hectic. The interface of the Genie is also not very good imo. I honestly blame lack of planning on my part with when we scheduled it and where to eat, etc. when I last went we could just go to a food court thing, but a lot of the places to eat now need a res. We still had a good time, but since we rope dropped we were dead by 4pm and left before the fireworks. I will say before 11 am the park was very manageable and lines moved quick. We also got pics with Winnie the Pooh!", "Your examples are terrible. If you\u2019re talking about your house, your car or your property, you obviously get to make the rules. \n\nNone of that applies when going on vacations with friends.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to tell other adults what to wear, what time to get up and other nonsense. This goes even if you are paying. You can tell them something like they are not allowed to get a smoking room and they are not allowed to use the mini bar.", "What is absurd is someone thinking it is ok to make rules for other adults unilaterally on a shared trip. This is a split vacation, they all get a say in any arbitrary rules. OP thought they would just acquiesce to her rules for their vacation, that's not how it works.", "If your goal was to say something absurd, you accomplished that!", "Oh god you were there with the high school bands, that\u2019s why it was chaos. They are pushing mobile order in the parks hard right now, which is why it can be harder to find places to eat. When we were there one quick service place had a 20 minute wait just to get in the door so you could wait in line but if you made a mobile order they could push you through faster. \n\nReservations have gotten harder to find for sit down restaurants although I don\u2019t think Disneyland releases all the openings at once.

She might need to hear, \u201cNobody\u2019s doing that.\u201d  But all she\u2019s doing is trying to structure the vacay in the way she thinks best:  I would object too, and not go if she insisted.  But she\u2019s not an AH for putting that foot out.  If it gets cut off, she\u2019s going to have to live with it.", "Even in a wedding, one person doesn\u2019t get to unilaterally make the rules. The bride has to get approval of the groom and the groom has to get approval of the bride. Also, it depends on if a parent or parents are paying for the wedding.
