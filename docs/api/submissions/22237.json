That's weird how does that work?\" To try to feel out if they clearly know what they are talking about or are just saying something they saw.

Im an information sponge though, so if its something that interested me, I'll always look it up, not cause I want to confirm what they said, but cause I want to learn more about it.  \n\nIf its boring to me, and I have no interest in whatever they told me, that is pretty much the only time I definitely won't look it up, cause I could care less.", "Eh, I can see how anxiety could lead someone to do that. Doesn\u2019t make her not an asshole, but it very well could be a bad coping mechanism to try to squash down any sort of uncertainty that pops up.
