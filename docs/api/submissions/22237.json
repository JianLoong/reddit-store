A lot of time I\u2019ll just say ok and google it to just double check. Do you think that is rude ? Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: my husband is right most of the time. Here is an example\nYesterday I told my husband I saw a silverfish (a bug) in our tub. I told him\n I\u2019m Worried we have a leak because I saw the bug. He said that is just a bug that likes humidity so it wouldn\u2019t be crazy to see a bug in a tub sense there could be condensation on the pipes.\n(About 2 years ago we thought we had a leak in the same area called a plumber to check and they did not find a leak). \n\nSense I\u2019m still anxious about a leak I looked it up on google to see if a silverfish would mean we have a leak. Google didn\u2019t have a conclusive answer. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve always had anxiety and I was dismissed a lot as a child because of my anxiety and so a lot of times I feel like I have to look myself because of it. \n\nThe trust isn\u2019t necessarily against my husband he\u2019s mostly always right but more of an anxiety response.\n\nI hope this answered most questions", "created_utc": 1689361237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zoy5i/aita_because_everytime_my_husband_tells_me_a_fact/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to get yourself to therapy for your anxiety and work on the automatic second guessing. You're demonstrating a lack of trust in your husband so of course he thinks it's rude.", "YTA. \n\nI have a friend who does this.  Its annoying as fuck.   Like, unless he has a history of just making shit up, why do you do that?\n\nWhat if you told him a fact about a friend of yours, and he immediately texted that friend to confirm.  Would you like that?\n\nWhen people do this, whether it is your intention or not, you are indicating that you think they are making things up or lying.", "Yes, if you're doing that for truly everything, then YTA. Why did you marry somebody who's competence you fundamentally don't trust?", "YTA - it'd be better if you looked it up to learn more about it. If it is only to check that he wasn't lying to you, that's rude.", "INFO: Does he often give you facts that are incorrect?", "info: how often is he right? if he is generally right, then YTA unless he says something really akward that you truly want to know more about.", "Every time?? Like if he says bring an umbrella its gonna rain you won't believe him?? Cause if so.. YTA", "How often do you search the things he says? And why do you feel the need to search it? This sounds like more than just a trust issue. You two need to talk to each other about this.", "INFO there is, in fact, context needed because; \n\n>just don\u2019t trust him if he gives me a fact\n\nLike, wtf? Why are you always questioning him? Must be some reason? \n\nFeeling as if Op is leaving context out because it reveals them as an AH.", "YTA that is pretty rude and very annoying. It would be one thing if it was a one off or super important but doing it constantly is just irritating.", "YTA\n\nyou shouldn\u2019t be doing it in front of him because the vibes you send out just spelled distrust. Also, internet could be wrong. Unless you are checking some scientific articles or something, hopefully you are aware that even wiki can be wrong.", "YTA \n\nOf course it\u2019s rude. What would you think if someone fact checked every little thing you said, right in front of your face, for no reason at all? Jeez it\u2019s a non-stop display of you distrusting your husband and kind of implying he\u2019s an idiot.", "Not enough info for an asshole determination.\n\nIs your husband frequently wrong about the things he says? Is he a stupid person? Is he known to make up random shit for shits and giggles or to trick you intentionally? Does he believe the earth is flat? Does he eat glue sticks?\n\nWhy do you need to fact check him so frequently? If this is a default behavior that occurs frequently, it would definitely become demeaning and annoying, and would demonstrate a lack of trust.\n\nI'd stop talking to you eventually.", "Unless the fact is something malicious (e.g. some sort of false discriminatory statistic or something) then YTA. If it's just a short fun fact, who cares whether it's true or not?", "Depends\n\nIs he right 99% of the time? Then maybe it's a little insulting that you don't trust his word. If not, check away.", "Can you not look these things up yourself first before asking your husband? It seems backwards that you bring something up to him, he responds, but then you have to double check him. I get that it\u2019s your anxiety but it is a clear insult to your husband to not take him at his word as well", "I had to google this to check, but yes, YTA. Fact.", "YTA unless your husband is a known idiot. Your marriage sounds taxing as hell either way.", "Unless he's the type who tells you ridiculous things and calls them facts just to mess with you, yeah, it's pretty rude. You're essentially saying *you're lying/wrong I'm looking that up.*\n\nWould you like it if he did to you every time you said something to him? YTA.", "I cant judge this without more context.\nMaybe YTA if you do it every single time.. me and my husband do this sometimes if the fact is particularly interesting/astounding. But if it was every time that I told him something, I'd begin to think he thought I was stupid.", "Think it depends how you go about it. The simple fact you look a fact up is NTA, if you make a big dog and pony show out of it, or nitpick at some minor details, then YTA", "If you do it right in front of him, yes, it's rude. Is he in the habit of saying a lot of stupid shit he passes off as fact that he needs double-checking after? It wouldn't be so bad if you positioned your googling as \"oh, this is very interesting, I'd like to find out more about it and so imma Google it for more in-depth info!\" But making a show right in front of him is a slap in the face. Or do you do it later, in private? In which case, he doesn't need to know.\n\nINFO: so, which is it?", "YTA. You said he\u2019s mostly right so it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s a BSer otherwise it\u2019d-make more sense. It does seem very disrespectful and rude. Atleast have the tact to not google it right away in front of his face.", "Soft YTA if it really is every time. It's one thing to double check with the bug issue but if he says something that doesn't really matter you don't need to go fact-check it. That would be just irritating to anyone. \n\nHowever, a lot of men don't want to hear that they might be wrong about something and it's a silly ego thing. I suspect there is some of that at play as well. Additionally, he really should be more understanding of your anxiety and stop being so sensitive.", "If he is mostly right it is a asshole move.\n\nYTA", "YTA, if most of the time the info he gives you is correct, WHY do you double-check?", "It's annoying AF, you're basically saying you don't trust what he says.\n\nYTA", "INFO: has your husband told you untrue \"facts\" in the past?", "INFO- really there is a lot of context necessary to know if this is needed or not. Some people triple down on insisting they are right even when you know they are wrong and you show proof. Those people you can never really know if they're accurate or blowing it out their ass. So in cases like that, no you wouldn't TA, he needs to get over it and demonstrate he was a reliable source.  If he's not habitually wrong then double checking  him all the time would make you TA.", "YTA, my sister does that all the time to me and it\u2019s so annoying,", "INFO\n\nAre these just in general or facts that not everyone knows? It's not rude to look up a fact but there's a lot of information missing.", "INFO: How often is he wrong? If you are doing it because he is wrong most of the time then that's one thing, but if he is usually right and you do it it is annoying.", "If you're only going to trust your own research why do you ask him anything to begin with?", "YTA. If you don't trust him, then don't ask him. I would find it highly insulting for my partner to ask me something, not believe me and then go to google to verify. Especially given the fact he's right most of the time. Also, when he does NOT know, does he say that?", "Why ask him shit of you aren\u2019t gonna listen and trust him? YTA I\u2019d get pretty damn tired of being fact checked all the time", "YTA. Having to double check everything he says on google has to be so damn annoying for him.", "INFO\n\nWhat make you think you can't trust the facts your husband tell you?", "Well if you do this a lot, how often is he right and how often is he wrong?....if he almost always is right, and you're still doing it I can see that coming off as rude.  If he's almost always wrong, I totally see why you do it and maybe he should fact check first before spewing disinformation.", "NTA\nIt's not about if your husband is right or wrong. You just want to double check the info. If he's annoyed maybe wait until later to check? Honestly, if more people looked for a 2nd source like you we'd have a lot less idiots in the world instead of believing everything at face value.", "INFO: How long have you been doing this and what percentage of the time would you estimate he is wrong?", "NTA.  since so many people are misinformed these days there\u2019s nothing fundamentally wrong with looking for confirmation of information from multiple sources before accepting it as factual.  (Given the types of information silos people tend to trap themselves in, it\u2019s actually advisable.)", "NTA. My wife and I always fact check each other. That way we both get to be right at the end of the day. It's not necessarily about trust. I trust my wife with my life. It's more about having our facts straight.\n\nIn the scientific world, this is called peer review. It makes things more credible to have multiple sources giving the same findings. It can be applied to anything from chemistry to just what color the sky is.", "This is interesting as I sonetimes do this as well.\n\nMy thought process is if I know something is true then I say its true. If I think its true then I say I think its true, if I'm not sure then I say I'm not sure etc etc\n\nOn the other hand my wife will say its true whether she knows it, thinks it or isn't sure.\n\n(On a phone so excuse the brevity)\n\nA few times she turned out to be wrong so I started googling and telling her the right answer (because then she'll know the correct answer and be pleased...) this annoyed her and since what I was asking was usually minor I stopped correcting her", "NAH. If it helps your anxiety to check things out online, he can live with it. It's not rude. I can see how it might offend him, but he has to realize it's not about him. (his behavior of just thinking it's rude doesn't rise to the level of being an a.h.)", "NTA.  My Dad was an expert \u201cknow it all\u201d while I was growing up.  I realized as I got older that a lot of his facts and stories were just ways for him to feel important and they were indeed bullshit.  I mean absolute bullshit.  Google and YouTube became the great bullshit leveler.", "Yta", "I hate when my wife does this but NTA just annoying", "You seem asphyxiating", "NTA\n\nThere's nothing wrong with confirming new information. Unless you're going \"nuh uh you're WRONG,\" like rubbing it in his face. That's rude.", "NTA... Google is your vice, embrace it.\n\nIm the same way, i double check google and my gf gets annoyed at it. A lot of times i am not looking to see if she or i am right,... but fishing for more information, to see if there is a more complete answer. Its a great learning tool and ive gotten addicted to using it.\n\nfyi... kitchen is the best place to ask stupid questions.... lots of great suggestions to store food, substitue ingredients, timer, advice etc.", "NTA. Those people who always spurt out nonsense, trusting their relationship will carry them forward, are toxic people. As far as i understand from what you wrote, you dont fact-check everyone in your life; but just your husband. He must has been spurting a lot of bs for a long time, that, causing you to force yourself into fact-checking him.\n\nRub it in his face, keep it up till he understands it is not a cool behavior.", "He is the man, everything he says is true.

You're projecting your own experience onto different people, with no evidence it's similar (or that the husband is a 'bullshitter') . I could as easily say this is MY Dad - who does constantly check facts, in an obnoxious way. \n\nHe does it in his case, because he wants to try to catch us as 'mistaken'. He likes dragging people down, to feel good about himself. But this story ISN'T automatically my Dad - and nor is it automatically yours. Some people on Reddit don't seem to realise that, when they're commenting. \n\nIf we take our Dads out of it, however - I will say I can still understand why would naturally get irritating for many people (if they are generally correct about their facts/not trying to bullshit).

I don't know why he still talks to you.", "You say that it's an anxiety response because you were often dismissed as a child, but I wonder if you've thought about this from your husband's perspective? In a way it's very dismissive of him to fact check everything, because it's showing that you don't trust him to be right. \n\nNow as others have said, people can be wrong about stuff-- and in general it's a good thing to confirm information for yourself rather than blindly trusting what others say. But I can also understand how this would be hurtful for your husband when it happens over and over. \n\nSo soft YTA, and I wonder if you are seeing a counselor or anyone to help with your anxiety? At the very least I suggest you be a bit more open with your husband about it, tho don't try to dismiss his feelings if he shares how it affects him.", "I mean, i have to make anything up due to lack of information. Thats how assumption works; trying to put some sense in an action by making up most possible scenarios. \n\nIn this case, it only makes sense if he was bs'ing all the time.

That doesnt make sense.\n\nAnyway, didnt search comments but if she confessed, then theres something off with her reasoning.", "thats a lie,\n\nshe said she looks up to ease her anxiety,..that could include looking for more info."]}
