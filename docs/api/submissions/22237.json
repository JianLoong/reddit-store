Have an honest talk with your husband about your anxiety. \n\nAs a personal anecdote, I had severe OCD (now mild-moderate with years of therapy), and I used to do this to my husband (and other people) all the time because I was truly terrified of doing/saying/understanding anything wrong. He was rightfully annoyed when he thought I never believed any facts he shared, despite him being right most of the time. Once I started working on my OCD, I was able to cut down on the amount of fact-checking I do, and he was able to better understand what was causing the fact-checking behavior. If you're in a similar situation, the issue is likely in communication, and the need to start (or continue) working through your anxiety.", "NTA trust but verify.

But if they have a fun fact to share then I want to know everything else they know about it because I just like to talk and learn about stuff I don\u2019t know.

I have bad OCD which triggers my anxiety, if I have any question about something, I have to research it because having a better understanding, helps ease my OCD & anxiety. \n\nOP should articulate to her husband why she googles everything and explain that it\u2019s from being doubted and it\u2019s not personal to him. She\u2019s just looking for more clarity. If he understands that it\u2019s not about him, he shouldn\u2019t take it personally. She needs to address the need to google everything with a therapist.

When it affects your life, and if it affects those around you it's probably long overdue.

OP needs to stop asking her partner until she gets treatment. The lack of trust shown, while seemingly small and anxiety driven, is serious and unhealthy for relationships. It's going to end in resentment. Our personalities are just a chemical balance, a lack of trust due to anxiety disorder is still a lack of trust.

You need that extra reassurance because you've relied on it for so long it's become like a coping mechanism for your anxiety and it's a natural response to everything. If you don't, a therapist would be helpful. Especially DBT. And if you haven't, sit down with your husband and explain why you do that. Open up to him with your trauma and how it's affected you in life and about your anxiety. With needing that extra reassurance I describe it as, when you think you locked the door/closed the garage (something like that) but you're not entirely sure so you go and check just to make sure you did. Or when you're playing a video game and it's not one of those automatic saves and you made so much progress, and when you go to exit the game you double save it by clicking save game and save and exit. Or when you're a kid and you finished your work and your teacher looks it over to make sure you answered all the questions. Sorry this is long.

It helps to get feedback. \n\nIf nobody was impolite about it, all should be fine, but I guess everyone takes feedback differently. Some may take it as a criticism of their character, others may take it as a heads-up on their sources.

It isn\u2019t about fact-checking, is it?  And you know that so quit being obtuse.\n\nIt is about being rude.  You don\u2019t go Google something after asking for a question so much *that it actually becomes an issue*.  \n\nI hate when people try to act like they don\u2019t know what the real argument is about.

Being able to input the correct search terms, being able to interpret the information correctly. After all, you're only human too. \n\nMy point is, you can Google til your heart's content, but when you start allowing those things to properly change your mind about whether or not you need surgery.. or let's say a recent example of vaccines etc then I'd say it's a problem, no better than the q-anon crowd who believes everything they see online or anti vaxxers who think that Chinese nano-bots are being injected etc etc because, I'm sure you could find sources on Google for these things to be true even though they're clearly not. \n\nI do have anxiety as well and before I go to the doctor I will Google and learn tons of stuff about all sorts of ailments, and then I go to the doctor and I turned out to be wrong about everything because I didn't see the most simple answer sitting right in front of me. The doctor did though, because that's their job. Most doctors barely like to treat fellow doctors because of they try and treat themselves, so imagine a sudden influx of thousands of patients who are also trying to do this, minus the 15 years of medical training and experience to go with it. \n\nTL;DR; Being informed is great, being a pain in the ass acting like you're the only one who has Google is annoying"]}
