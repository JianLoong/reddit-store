I couldn\u2019t imagine being that selfish. Ever. I would make it so that my husband spent all the time he wants with his grandmother. Without hesitation. Not even a question. That\u2019s just a huge red flag.", "Thank you all for the kind words. I am going to stay.", "Absolutely NTA but your wife sure as hell is. How cold hearted is this woman that she gets mad at you for wanting to spend what will be your grandmas last Christmas with her.", "NTA but your wife's attitude so early on in the marriage isn't a very good sign for the future. \n\nWas she always this selfish or is this the first time you're seeing her like this? \n\nNot sure how old she is but assuming she's an adult, that's old enough to understand the huge difference between the last Christmas with a loved one vs the first of many Christmas with your in-laws. \n\nI'd love to know if she'd \"compromise\" if it was her relative the one that was facing their last Christmas.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry to hear of your news.

One Xmas, my sibling and I debated to visit our grandparents because there was a snowstorm coming.  We woke that morning and said screw it.  Let's go.  My boyfriend at the time (now husband) even offered to drive, but we told him to stay with his family.  It is like we knew this was to be special to us.  He totally understood and defended my decision against his upset mother.   Dove the two hours, stayed until a hour before sunset and caught the beginning of the storm pulling into our hometown.\n\n...My grandfather died January 5th right afterwards.  He had been sick of a long time but had been fine at Xmas.  We were the only grandkids to see him before he passed because the others were scared off by the storm threat.\n\nMy sibling and I are happy we told the risk.  The pictures from then give us comfort every year since.

Your wife really should be more understanding.", "NTA Your wife needs to take a step back and see the big picture here as well as be more supportive during this time.

Spend as much time with her as possible, take pictures, make memories, show her love, and make sure her last days are filled with joy!

In the first year of marriage when I loved and adored this man I wouldn't have even asked him to make that decision, I would have demanded we, together, spend as much time with her as possible. Even now with all of the hard feelings, resentment, anger, and hurt there is between us I would still do this. \n\nLosing someone you love is so hard, your wife the person you have committed your life to and vise versa (especially so newly married, when the love is at it's strongest) should be doing everything possible to ease this pain for you.", "NTA.

Anytime things are getting really bad I make sure he's on the next plane out to see here and help with the kids. Even if it's during the holidays. I stay home with the kids/pets and make sure home is running smoothly so he doesn't have to worry even more. My entire extended family supports him and his sister and even send her gifts or donates to her gofundme. My grandmother isn't doing well as of late and he suggested that we make weekly visits to help out and bring dinner once a week.\n\nI really hope your wife is just \"having a moment\" because this isn't how someone treats the love of their life.", "NTA. She's the selfish one. When you have someone close to like say your grandmother dying as a partner you should be supportive to help out your spouse.", "I don't think my partner knew his dad was dying. But the day his dad died, me and him were hanging out and he got the call at like 10am. I went with him to the hospital. I sat downstairs in the main waiting room just knitting. I didn't pressure him to be with me at the time. I just sat there to be there for him. Our best friend drove the two hours from his school to be there. And we just sat downstairs and waited. And his dad passed and we then distracted him with food and a movie and just being there for him. When you have close family that is terminally ill, you should be able to spend as much time with them as they allow you too. \n\nI couldn't see my dad's mom much before she died because I had no way to make the two hours drive to see her in the nursing home she was at. My mom's mom didn't want us to drive all the way down to see her in the nursing home because she didn't like people seeing her that way. \n\nMy brother died very unexpectedly. Like medical issues and the doctor sedated him on his back while he was throwing up so we're pretty sure he aspirated his throw up. He went in for a blockage in his intestine on a Friday and he was dead on Sunday. But four weeks before he died my mom went down and spent two weeks at my dad's house to get away from home for a while and she got to spend time with my little brother because he was in a home down near my dad. So my mom got two weeks of hanging out with my little sisters and my brother and my dad and stepmom and I'm so glad that she has those memories. Because she came home and he died two weeks later.", "You guys are amazing. Sending love \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Get a therapist or a divorce lawyer. This is MAJOR lack of care.", "NTA cherish whatever time you have left with your grandmother.", "NTA but I would be looking long and hard at the person you married. You really ok with being with the kind of person who would deny you 1 last Christmas with your grandmother?", "NTA.\nI had the same situation with my grandfather last year for Christmas. We had just had our first child in August and I wanted a memory of them together. \nMIL hated it, I didn\u2019t care. I regret nothing and am so grateful we were able to spend time with him before he was really sick and passed in March. \nIf your wife was in the same position, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d choose her family over yours. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have such sad news at Christmas time. I hope you get to spend a bit of extra time with your grandma xx", "I\u2019m worried for you, because if your wife truly/honestly/sincerely believes that you are selfish to want to be with your terminally ill grandmother, you need to run. Her reasoning and values are warped and you cannot expect her to put you or anyone in your life ahead of herself.\n\nGood luck to you\n\nNTA", "NTA - your wife sucks", "NTA\n\nIf you love your grandma, which I guess you do, go see her. You never get those moments again. Just be aware there might be bad blood between your wife and you. I\u2019d still do it. Because you very soon may never again have time with her.\n\nI ended my relationship with my then boyfriend over my grandma, who had cancer. I asked him to not expect much texts/phone calls from me, because I\u2019d be visiting her. He agreed. Guess who freaked out because I didn\u2019t text often enough? \n\nI spent my last evening with her in the guest room arguing with the fucker. I\u2019m still angry at him for those 3 hours. It\u2019s time I lost. I would give everything to get them back. Yes, I am crying right now. I miss her. \n\nDon\u2019t waste your time with her. It\u2019s precious.", "NTA your wife is absolutely despicable! \nIf it were me I would be insisting my husband spend as much time with his Gran as possible!", "Spend the Christmas with your grandmother.  You will regret not doing so if you cave to your wife, because no woman who has that little human decency is going to be in your life long term.  Be with your family, and then when that has passed you can talk to your wife about whether she plans on treating the vacuous hole in her soul or whether you'll be leaving her to find some other poor man to victimize.  NTA- you should really evaluate whether your wife is the kind of person you want in your life- I certainly wouldn't.", "NTA. This reminds me of the post where the wife was mad because her husband (the OP) wanted to take one last vacation with his recently diagnosed terminally ill niece instead of going on a Parisian vacation that they were planning. Mind you nothing had been purchased, it was all still in the planning stages. She told OP that she adamantly refused to go because she wanted to go to Paris. I\u2019m sure you can guess that everyone tore her apart which is nothing she didn\u2019t deserve.\n\nIf my husband came to me with this dilemma, of course I\u2019d want him to spend the time with his grandmother. Give her one last happy memory with the whole family before she dies. Time is one thing you can never get back. The regret will eat you alive.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with the same advice I left for the other post. Spend that time with your family and divorce your wife. She\u2019s sounds heartless and I guarantee she\u2019d be kicking up a sh&t storm if the roles were reversed.", "NTA I lost my last remaining grandparent (my Nana) in April. I'm so glad I spent the time with her that I did. Have your Christmas, make it a happy one, and keep those memories in your heart. Good luck, OP, and much love to your grandma.", "This wife, needs to become an ex. The gal to be anything but sympathetic to you when your grandma has weeks/months left to live and you want to spend her last Christmas with her is completely unbelievable. \n\nSounds mean, but kick her to the curb and anyone else who claims you're in the wrong. Nta", "NTA your gramma is not going to be with you for much longer. It\u2019s not a maybe. It\u2019s a fact. \nYour wife is not reasonable to expect for you to want to miss what little time you have with her.  \nMarriage is supposed to be about supporting each other.", "Definetly NTA. I wish I could have one more Christmas with my grandma, enjoy!", "NTA, I didn\u2019t spend enough time with my grandma before she passed. I regret it everyday", "NTA. Your wife needs to learn to compromise. That means realizing all her own dreams for a perfect Christmas have to wait an entire year because it's less important than a dying family member. It's sad she can't see what's required of her for you two to reach a compromise. That's all there is to it, she's failing her vows, plain and simple.", "NTA\nYour wife is acting incredibly selfish. She's showing you zero empathy. Hope you stay home & spend Christmas w/your grams. If you don't, you'll probably regret it for yrs to come.

Sorry to hear about your grandma.", "NTA your wife is not having any empathy or sympathy here and that\u2019s a bad sign.", "NTA and your wife is a jerk. You have years together, grandma only has now. She could offer to stay with you, or travel alone, but she has chosen to be selfish.", "NTA - Prepare yourself. The doctors try their best to be accurate, but they can easily overestimate or underestimate the time. My family member (also cancer in her liver) was told she probably had 3 months to live, but she died just under 3 weeks later. Spend the time you can with your grandma.", "I\u2019m going to be the voice of dissent here-NAH\n\nOne of my best friends was in almost this exact situation. They had just gotten engaged, agreed to Thanksgiving with her family & Christmas with his. The day after Thanksgiving, her grandma found out she only had weeks left. She convinced her fianc\u00e9 to spend Christmas with her family, and they would do both holidays with his the next year. Mid-January, his mom had a heart attack & died on the spot. \nThey both lost a loved one, but at least she got those last two holidays with her grandma; he hadn\u2019t seen his mom in months. \n\nThere is no easy answer here, but the point is that we never know when the last anything is occurring. Don\u2019t take time for granted.", "NTA.  I would be concerned about your wife's lack of empathy, though, and her attempt to emotionally manipulate you by deflecting and calling *you* selfish for wanting to spend one last holiday with a dying family member you love.  It's very stressful to know you're about to lose somebody you love and instead of easing that burden she is choosing to add to it.  That's so far from okay that I would question the type of person I married.  \n\nA few years ago, my MIL's health declined rapidly and to the point we found out it was most likely her last Christmas just a few days before the holiday.  My husband and I live several states away.  I wasn't able to get plane tickets home, but I managed to kennel the dogs (had to call 5 different kennels to find room), find a hotel room (nearly impossible), and I informed my husband we needed to go home for Christmas.  He actually wasn't convinced and thought he'd go visit solo sometime later in January, but I insisted. My MIL usually hosted Christmas Eve and the entire family still planned on going over there and I knew she wasn't up to hosting and none of them would think to bring food, so I also cooked and packed an entire holiday meal into a cooler that would only need reheated once we got there.  My FIL and MIL went to church and got home to us on their porch waiting for them, right before the rest of the family arrived.  My MIL was so happy she wept.  My husband got one more holiday with his mother, which meant the world to him.  She passed away a few days into January.\n\nI will add to the above that my MIL was always incredibly shitty to me.  We're talking 20 years of nasty.  I physically dreaded any time spent with the woman.  But that last Christmas wasn't about me, it was about supporting my husband and trying to keep his regrets to a minimum.  That's what marriage is:  supporting the person you love.", "NTA\nThis is just a terrible circumstance where there's really no other choice and your wife should be happy she hasn't been in a situation like this ever.", "NTA. Spend the time with your grandmother. Your wife is being selfish expecting you to drop everything for her own family.", "NTA\n\nMy wife's dad was diagnosed with cancer before the holidays. We had planned to host my family for Thanksgiving. It became just me hosting so she could go have last Thanksgiving with her dad. We both went to his place for Christmas. Neither of us will ever regret that decision, nor will my family ever even consider being upset about it.", "NTA your wife is way out of line. It's the last one with your grandma. Your wife's family is probably more understanding than your wife", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re facing this loss, and I\u2019m so sorry your wife isn\u2019t able to support you and offer love and empathy. I\u2019ve been married a while, and we usually spend a particular holiday with my in-laws. A few years ago, I was in the exact position you are, but with my dad. We knew it was our last holiday, and we spent it with my family. My in-laws were absolutely supportive. Why can\u2019t your in-laws celebrate with you a different time? This is also a thing we do.", "NTA - this makes me think of when my grandma was dying from cancer, she wanted to see me, so I rented a car and drove down to see her for 2 days. \n\nMy ex (at the time my hubby), was livid I spent the money to go see her when 'she's dying and you going down isn't going to bring her back so quit wasting money'. \n\nI said screw him, went down and had an amazing 2 days with her. It was the last time I seen her, and it was worth all the money I spent.", "NTA but your wife is for not understanding. I just can't imagine anyone not understanding what you're going through, especially your wife.

I hope it's a very special Xmas for you and your family", "NTA\n\nAs a past oncology nurse things can sometimes happen very suddenly and unexpectedly with cancer. Be with her, it\u2019s the last chance you have to talk to her and try to make everlasting memories you can cherish.

I have lost BOTH my PARENTS to cancer and for any Holiday that was going on, my husband INSISTED that I spend the time with them. He would tell me my memories and my heart needed to be there and that we still have a lifetime to celebrate together, so a year of focusing on each of them was what was needed.  He also said he could never forgive himself if he made me choose between them or him at such a horrible time.", "NTA at all!! I'm really sorry for your grandmother, mine passed away early this year and I spent all the festivies plus our birthdays with her because I knew they were going to be our lasts together.
