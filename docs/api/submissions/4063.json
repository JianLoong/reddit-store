I couldn\u2019t imagine being that selfish. Ever. I would make it so that my husband spent all the time he wants with his grandmother. Without hesitation. Not even a question. That\u2019s just a huge red flag.", "Thank you all for the kind words. I am going to stay.", "Absolutely NTA but your wife sure as hell is. How cold hearted is this woman that she gets mad at you for wanting to spend what will be your grandmas last Christmas with her.", "NTA but your wife's attitude so early on in the marriage isn't a very good sign for the future. \n\nWas she always this selfish or is this the first time you're seeing her like this? \n\nNot sure how old she is but assuming she's an adult, that's old enough to understand the huge difference between the last Christmas with a loved one vs the first of many Christmas with your in-laws. \n\nI'd love to know if she'd \"compromise\" if it was her relative the one that was facing their last Christmas.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry to hear of your news.

If she does, this is her last Christmas.

One Xmas, my sibling and I debated to visit our grandparents because there was a snowstorm coming.  We woke that morning and said screw it.  Let's go.  My boyfriend at the time (now husband) even offered to drive, but we told him to stay with his family.  It is like we knew this was to be special to us.  He totally understood and defended my decision against his upset mother.   Dove the two hours, stayed until a hour before sunset and caught the beginning of the storm pulling into our hometown.\n\n...My grandfather died January 5th right afterwards.  He had been sick of a long time but had been fine at Xmas.  We were the only grandkids to see him before he passed because the others were scared off by the storm threat.\n\nMy sibling and I are happy we told the risk.  The pictures from then give us comfort every year since.

I'm sorry about your grandma. Make all the good memories you can.", "NTA. Your wife really should be more understanding.", "NTA Your wife needs to take a step back and see the big picture here as well as be more supportive during this time. It\u2019s also bothersome that she said the decision was yours but then threw a fit when you didn\u2019t make the decision she wanted.", "NTA- OP please please please don't let your wife bully or guilt you into leaving, these are the last moments you will have with your grandmother, you will never get them back. Spend as much time with her as possible, take pictures, make memories, show her love, and make sure her last days are filled with joy!

In the first year of marriage when I loved and adored this man I wouldn't have even asked him to make that decision, I would have demanded we, together, spend as much time with her as possible. Even now with all of the hard feelings, resentment, anger, and hurt there is between us I would still do this. \n\nLosing someone you love is so hard, your wife the person you have committed your life to and vise versa (especially so newly married, when the love is at it's strongest) should be doing everything possible to ease this pain for you.", "NTA.

My husband and I live several states away.  I wasn't able to get plane tickets home, but I managed to kennel the dogs (had to call 5 different kennels to find room), find a hotel room (nearly impossible), and I informed my husband we needed to go home for Christmas.  He actually wasn't convinced and thought he'd go visit solo sometime later in January, but I insisted. My MIL usually hosted Christmas Eve and the entire family still planned on going over there and I knew she wasn't up to hosting and none of them would think to bring food, so I also cooked and packed an entire holiday meal into a cooler that would only need reheated once we got there.  My FIL and MIL went to church and got home to us on their porch waiting for them, right before the rest of the family arrived.  My MIL was so happy she wept.  My husband got one more holiday with his mother, which meant the world to him.  She passed away a few days into January.\n\nI will add to the above that my MIL was always incredibly shitty to me.  We're talking 20 years of nasty.  I physically dreaded any time spent with the woman.

I couldn't afford to stay in a hotel and staying in his guest room would have been a burden. My dad was given months by doctors. He always acted tough if I was around so I knew he needed space between my visits.\n\nI couldn't drive two states away often enough and when he passed, it was upsetting. He went faster than expected. My stepmom is still traumatized by his passing, he went late at night and she was all alone. His hospice nurse was supposed to start a few days later.\n\nOp, can you imagine being with your wife's family when you receive that call? OPs wife might be angry now, but I can imagine the resentment if that happens.", "I was just in that boat, but mine didn\u2019t make it to thanksgiving.

Go and spending time with your grandma.\n\nI would suggest that you call your in-laws directly and explain to them the situation.  It's the polite thing to do, and you can share with them the gravity of the situation.", "NTA op. In my family and many many others - we all have conflicts to schedule when holidays come. You are NTA to want to change plans this year and be with a dying loved one. Hopefully your in laws would understand. \n\n(What if you had to work? What if you were the in doctor? What if you had a multi month job out of country? What if you where bedridden and had to stay home?)\n\n\nSo many times people have to miss Christmas - and kind, loving people understand , and make up the lost time another time. Your wife is being incredibly selfish to not let this one go this year and be with grandma", "NTA.  I would do the same.  If your family has not already, consider contacting hospice for help with Grandma.  They were a huge help with several of my family members at their end of life weeks/months.  They can help keep Grandma comfortable and improve quality of life towards the end.  For my grandparents they provided hospital beds when needed and nurses to help with care which allowed my grandparents to stay in their homes all the way to the end.  \n\nI hope for peace and comfort for you and your family.", "Amen!!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
