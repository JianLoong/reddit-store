I couldn\u2019t imagine being that selfish. Ever. I would make it so that my husband spent all the time he wants with his grandmother. Without hesitation. Not even a question. That\u2019s just a huge red flag.", "Thank you all for the kind words. I am going to stay.", "Absolutely NTA but your wife sure as hell is. How cold hearted is this woman that she gets mad at you for wanting to spend what will be your grandmas last Christmas with her.", "NTA but your wife's attitude so early on in the marriage isn't a very good sign for the future. \n\nWas she always this selfish or is this the first time you're seeing her like this? \n\nNot sure how old she is but assuming she's an adult, that's old enough to understand the huge difference between the last Christmas with a loved one vs the first of many Christmas with your in-laws. \n\nI'd love to know if she'd \"compromise\" if it was her relative the one that was facing their last Christmas.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry to hear of your news.

One Xmas, my sibling and I debated to visit our grandparents because there was a snowstorm coming.  We woke that morning and said screw it.  Let's go.  My boyfriend at the time (now husband) even offered to drive, but we told him to stay with his family.  It is like we knew this was to be special to us.  He totally understood and defended my decision against his upset mother.   Dove the two hours, stayed until a hour before sunset and caught the beginning of the storm pulling into our hometown.\n\n...My grandfather died January 5th right afterwards.  He had been sick of a long time but had been fine at Xmas.  We were the only grandkids to see him before he passed because the others were scared off by the storm threat.\n\nMy sibling and I are happy we told the risk.  The pictures from then give us comfort every year since.

Your wife really should be more understanding.", "NTA Your wife needs to take a step back and see the big picture here as well as be more supportive during this time.

Spend as much time with her as possible, take pictures, make memories, show her love, and make sure her last days are filled with joy!

In the first year of marriage when I loved and adored this man I wouldn't have even asked him to make that decision, I would have demanded we, together, spend as much time with her as possible. Even now with all of the hard feelings, resentment, anger, and hurt there is between us I would still do this. \n\nLosing someone you love is so hard, your wife the person you have committed your life to and vise versa (especially so newly married, when the love is at it's strongest) should be doing everything possible to ease this pain for you.", "NTA.

Anytime things are getting really bad I make sure he's on the next plane out to see here and help with the kids. Even if it's during the holidays. I stay home with the kids/pets and make sure home is running smoothly so he doesn't have to worry even more. My entire extended family supports him and his sister and even send her gifts or donates to her gofundme. My grandmother isn't doing well as of late and he suggested that we make weekly visits to help out and bring dinner once a week.\n\nI really hope your wife is just \"having a moment\" because this isn't how someone treats the love of their life.", "NTA. She's the selfish one. When you have someone close to like say your grandmother dying as a partner you should be supportive to help out your spouse.", "I don't think my partner knew his dad was dying. But the day his dad died, me and him were hanging out and he got the call at like 10am. I went with him to the hospital. I sat downstairs in the main waiting room just knitting. I didn't pressure him to be with me at the time. I just sat there to be there for him. Our best friend drove the two hours from his school to be there. And we just sat downstairs and waited. And his dad passed and we then distracted him with food and a movie and just being there for him. When you have close family that is terminally ill, you should be able to spend as much time with them as they allow you too. \n\nI couldn't see my dad's mom much before she died because I had no way to make the two hours drive to see her in the nursing home she was at. My mom's mom didn't want us to drive all the way down to see her in the nursing home because she didn't like people seeing her that way. \n\nMy brother died very unexpectedly. Like medical issues and the doctor sedated him on his back while he was throwing up so we're pretty sure he aspirated his throw up. He went in for a blockage in his intestine on a Friday and he was dead on Sunday. But four weeks before he died my mom went down and spent two weeks at my dad's house to get away from home for a while and she got to spend time with my little brother because he was in a home down near my dad. So my mom got two weeks of hanging out with my little sisters and my brother and my dad and stepmom and I'm so glad that she has those memories. Because she came home and he died two weeks later.", "You guys are amazing. Sending love \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Get a therapist or a divorce lawyer. This is MAJOR lack of care.", "NTA cherish whatever time you have left with your grandmother.", "NTA but I would be looking long and hard at the person you married. You really ok with being with the kind of person who would deny you 1 last Christmas with your grandmother?", "NTA.\nI had the same situation with my grandfather last year for Christmas. We had just had our first child in August and I wanted a memory of them together. \nMIL hated it, I didn\u2019t care. I regret nothing and am so grateful we were able to spend time with him before he was really sick and passed in March. \nIf your wife was in the same position, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d choose her family over yours. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have such sad news at Christmas time. I hope you get to spend a bit of extra time with your grandma xx", "I\u2019m worried for you, because if your wife truly/honestly/sincerely believes that you are selfish to want to be with your terminally ill grandmother, you need to run. Her reasoning and values are warped and you cannot expect her to put you or anyone in your life ahead of herself.\n\nGood luck to you\n\nNTA", "NTA - your wife sucks", "NTA\n\nIf you love your grandma, which I guess you do, go see her. You never get those moments again. Just be aware there might be bad blood between your wife and you. I\u2019d still do it. Because you very soon may never again have time with her.\n\nI ended my relationship with my then boyfriend over my grandma, who had cancer. I asked him to not expect much texts/phone calls from me, because I\u2019d be visiting her. He agreed. Guess who freaked out because I didn\u2019t text often enough? \n\nI spent my last evening with her in the guest room arguing with the fucker. I\u2019m still angry at him for those 3 hours. It\u2019s time I lost. I would give everything to get them back. Yes, I am crying right now. I miss her. \n\nDon\u2019t waste your time with her. It\u2019s precious.", "NTA your wife is absolutely despicable! \nIf it were me I would be insisting my husband spend as much time with his Gran as possible!", "Spend the Christmas with your grandmother.  You will regret not doing so if you cave to your wife, because no woman who has that little human decency is going to be in your life long term.  Be with your family, and then when that has passed you can talk to your wife about whether she plans on treating the vacuous hole in her soul or whether you'll be leaving her to find some other poor man to victimize.  NTA- you should really evaluate whether your wife is the kind of person you want in your life- I certainly wouldn't.", "NTA. This reminds me of the post where the wife was mad because her husband (the OP) wanted to take one last vacation with his recently diagnosed terminally ill niece instead of going on a Parisian vacation that they were planning. Mind you nothing had been purchased, it was all still in the planning stages. She told OP that she adamantly refused to go because she wanted to go to Paris. I\u2019m sure you can guess that everyone tore her apart which is nothing she didn\u2019t deserve.\n\nIf my husband came to me with this dilemma, of course I\u2019d want him to spend the time with his grandmother. Give her one last happy memory with the whole family before she dies. Time is one thing you can never get back. The regret will eat you alive.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with the same advice I left for the other post. Spend that time with your family and divorce your wife. She\u2019s sounds heartless and I guarantee she\u2019d be kicking up a sh&t storm if the roles were reversed.", "NTA I lost my last remaining grandparent (my Nana) in April. I'm so glad I spent the time with her that I did. Have your Christmas, make it a happy one, and keep those memories in your heart. Good luck, OP, and much love to your grandma.", "This wife, needs to become an ex. The gal to be anything but sympathetic to you when your grandma has weeks/months left to live and you want to spend her last Christmas with her is completely unbelievable. \n\nSounds mean, but kick her to the curb and anyone else who claims you're in the wrong. Nta", "NTA your gramma is not going to be with you for much longer. It\u2019s not a maybe. It\u2019s a fact. \nYour wife is not reasonable to expect for you to want to miss what little time you have with her.  \nMarriage is supposed to be about supporting each other.", "Definetly NTA. I wish I could have one more Christmas with my grandma, enjoy!", "NTA, I didn\u2019t spend enough time with my grandma before she passed. I regret it everyday", "NTA. Your wife needs to learn to compromise. That means realizing all her own dreams for a perfect Christmas have to wait an entire year because it's less important than a dying family member. It's sad she can't see what's required of her for you two to reach a compromise. That's all there is to it, she's failing her vows, plain and simple.", "NTA\nYour wife is acting incredibly selfish. She's showing you zero empathy. Hope you stay home & spend Christmas w/your grams. If you don't, you'll probably regret it for yrs to come. Wife is 100% TA.\nHope you share this post w/her, reading the comments would be beneficial for her. \nSometimes ppl can't see the error of their ways, until its literally spelled out right in front of them.", "Propose to go for a visit next year to make up for not going now and call yourself and explain the situation  to  your in laws.  If they are half decent people  they will understand.  Nta"]}
