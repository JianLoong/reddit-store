They should both be aware now that you don\u2019t act like a fool in other peoples homes, so good on you.", "NTA - you're not wrong. Alice does not deserve another chance. This wasn't a \"mistake\" - it was something she did deliberately. What is her next mistake going to be? She didn't know she couldn't take and pawn your jewelry? She didn't know that your credit cards are for you, not her? She thought taking your car without asking and wrecking it is okay, just a mistake?\n\nYour son is finally \"getting some\" so he's willing to follow her to her parents house rather than admit she's in the wrong.", "NTA \n\nHonestly, it was a mistake to let Alice move in in the first place - such arrangements rarely work out. You were more than reasonable and Jake is still very immature. As long as you are patient with him and able to calmly explain your decision, he will understand sooner or later.", "Why do they need to move in together when they don\u2019t have the money to buy an apartment?

She had a party at your house without asking(did she ask your son? If yes and he decided not to tell you, there's another one) She let the party get out of control. When she and her friends were asked to leave *by the person with more claim to the house, the owners daughter* ...she refused. She trashed your house. Did anything get stolen?? She put a minor child in an upsetting/dangerous  situation.\n\nThat is a whole smorgasbord of poor decisions they are trying to pass off as a little 'whoopsies'.\n\nHe's an adult, and can follow her if he finds this type of treatment towards his sister, parents and his home acceptable. Keep communication open and be supportive in a hands off way. Tell him your door is always open (for him). I have a feeling that a GF that likes to get trashed with her friends while he's at work....is going to get old, fast.", "NTA she is taking advantage and  your son is young and dumb when it comes to his girlfriend right now.let him stay with her for a while no harm done. He won't stay mad forever.", "NTA - Alice needed to go. Jake is an adult and can make his own choices where he lives.  Don't be surprised if he shows up needing a place to stay in the near future.", "NTA\n\nAlice needed to go. Your son is going to have to learn the hard way.", "NTA. That was completely rude and irresponsible.\n\nWhere were Jake and your husband in the middle of the night so they didn't view this?", "NTA...call your sons bluff and let him move out...seems like a win for everyone", "NTA \n\nAlice is disrespectful and should be apologetic. You gave her a place to stay and she clearly didn\u2019t value that.\n\nYour son is acting like a child and should understand your position.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need that kind of trouble. She's disrespectful and doesn't deserve to live in your house. Not only that, but she could have caused you legal problems. Cops could have been called due to the noise and anyone that left there drunk and crashed would be on the home owner. \n\nIf your son wants to be immature and choose his gf of 8 months over his family, let him! Hopefully he'll learn his lesson eventually.", "NTA. this is an excellent time for Jake to spread his wings and stand by the woman he  \"loves\".\n\nhe should absolutely go move in with his GF's parents.

Please do what you feel you need to do for a happy life. We are here if you need us.\" then that be the end of it.", "NTA \n\nShe disrespected you and your family.

Invite someone into your home and they turn it into party central while you're trying to earn a living. Who wouldn't love that? But hey, give them another chance, right? Because everyone deserves to have their house trashed twice. No, darling, you stood up for your home and family. NTA.", "NTA. If your son chooses to go with his girlfriend, I hope he shows their home more respect than she did to yours. He will hopefully realise how inappropriate her behaviour was when he lives separately to you.", "NTA of course,  but let me get this straight:    \n\nThere were adult male strangers, drunk, in your home, playing loud music and generally causing chaos...while your 17 year old probably cowered in her bed with a pillow over her head for who knows how long, before she called you?    And if your son wasn't there, that means your 17 year old was the only family member in the family home for some period of time, while potentially dangerous activities were going on in the house.\n\n...and the girl who orchestrated it all, and who has been peripherally in the life of your family for less time than a full-term pregnancy thinks she deserves another chance?   To live in your home? \n\nI hope your son would listen to you if you told him to run.    Or show him this thread, because I know I'm not the only one saying this.\n\nNTA, and  I hope your son will come to see that this is not a healthy relationship he is in.   He's having a relationship with a spoiled, bratty party-girl who doesn't want to grow up.", "NTA, not to mention that they could have put your daughter in danger or uncomfortable situations. A bunch of drunk  belligerent 22 yo people, and I assume some were guys? How long until one of them started putting the moves on your teen girl?", "NTA\n\nYou are not in the wrong. Please don\u2019t back down or Alice will make you her doormat for the entirety of her relationship with your son. \n\nThis is probably your sons first serious relationship and his instinct is to defend his partner. Some lessons can\u2019t be taught, this is a lesson you have to let your son learn on his own, that even his romantic partners have to respect people\u2019s boundaries and adhere to basic common courtesy. \n\nExplain that your home is not his partners private nightclub and he can\u2019t be angry at you for not allowing his partner to treat his sister and parents as her personal doormat. \n\nWish him well with his relationship and tell him your door is always open for visits.", "Your son is being absurd, he'll grow out of it. Trust him to come back to you later, just keep reiterating that her behaviour and decisions were beyond disrespectful and the trust has been broken.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe did not make one mistake. Is was a long row of mistakes that led to that situation.\n\nBut honestly, for the relationship with your son, you could have handled the situation better. Sitting down with the two of them and having a talk about trust that is gone and has to be rebuild", "You're NTA, but you kicked his girlfriend out after one strike.
