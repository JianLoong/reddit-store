At this point it was like 1 in the morning.

Tilly explained that Alice invited her friends over to the house and they're all getting drunk and \"acting crazy\" and refusing to leave. I told Tilly to stay put and I'd come home.\n\nI had to leave work and I immediately drove home. I could hear the music booming from the house 2 blocks away with how loud it was I went ballistic as soon as I got through the door and yelled at all of Alice's friends to leave or I'd call the cops.\n\nAlice was drunk and argumentative, as angry as I was there was no reasoning with her or having a proper conversation and she went to sleep.\n\nThe house was absolutely trashed. I called my husband so we could make sense of the situation.\n\nWhen Jake got home, I told him what happened. I told Jake me and his dad agree that Alice can't stay here anymore, and she needs to be out by the end of next week.\n\nJake protested and said we're being unfair and that it's just one mistake and she deserves another chance. He got really upset and stormed off.\n\nAlice moved back in with her parents the next day. Now Jake is talking about moving in with them and is avoiding us.

I assume she wasn't staying with you because of problems at her own home, and you were far more generous, kind, and cool than most parents would be by welcoming her into your home. She took advantage of that and it is absolutely fair for her to face the music. Especially because she showed disregard to not only your home and your job, but she also put your underage daughter in a really tricky situation. I'm sure that was a hard phone call for Tilly to make \u2013 I remember being a teenage girl and narcing on cool older girls was the absolute last thing I would have wanted to do. I probably would have only picked the phone up if I was seriously freaked out.\n\nAs far as Jake goes \u2013 he'll come around, even if he's mad at you for a little while first. Just remind him that you love him and give it time. You're not kicking him out, after all, and you asked her to leave with good reason. But also, this is a good teaching moment for him! We all end up being a little self-involved while we figure adulthood out in our early twenties. It's good to be reminded every once in a while that being an adult comes with boundaries, expectations, and consequences. Better for him to learn that lesson now from his parents who love and support him than later from someone who wont extend the same.", "You are in the right.  Alice had a loud, drunken party at 1 a.m. with your 17 year old daughter in the house.  Giving her another change isn't going to fix that level of irresponsibility, poor judgement, inconsiderateness, and entitlement.\n\nAllowing his GF to frighten and perhaps endanger your daughter isn't going to improve your relationship with Jake.  You being an responsible adult he can respect, rely upon, and look up to is the way to go here; succumbing to his unreasonable demands because if you don't, he's making threats that he'll leave and he might not like you is not the way to go.\n\nJake is 22.  If he wants to make like a grown-up and have his own place where he lives with his GF, swell.  Let him support himself, find suitable housing, and take on adult responsibilities.   \nBut the expectation that his parents are supposed to put up with his GF trashing their home in the course of a drunken party because he waaaaants her there, and if you don't give her another chance he'll leeeeeave reflects immature thinking and childish demands that you really shouldn't be indulging.  That would not be a good way to help Jake grow up and become mature and independent.\n\nAlice is his problem, not your problem.\n\nNTA.
