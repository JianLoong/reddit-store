Honestly, even if your husband was doing all of the work and you weren\u2019t pregnant, it wouldn\u2019t be their place to butt in and start talking about how you were being lazy. If they want to lighten your husband\u2019s workload, suggest that they stay at a different house next time. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not Muslim so I\u2019m not 100% sure about this part, so feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t think that fasting is necessarily going for weeks without any food at all, iirc there are just specific times that you fast during (sunrise to sunset i think??), so it wasn\u2019t like your husband was literally starving to death while he had to make meals for others.", "NTA.

She\u2019s more likely jealous of your equal and loving partner. It sounds like a classic example of a man being congratulated for doing what may be considered a minimum for a woman.

Yes, and that's most likely the point, to be able to better appreciate the blessings you have.\n\nYou both were doing your established routine.

When it comes to housework and childcare it seems that men are praised for doing more than nothing and women are criticized for doing less than everything.\n\nHere's my story: when our child was born,\nboth my husband and I would continue to work full-time, and we agreed to share childcare like this: I would be the \"primary parent\" Sundays through Wednesdays, and he would be the \"primary parent\" Thursdays through Saturdays. The \"primary parent\" would basically do all the childcare that day (take him to and from daycare if it was a workday), dress him, meals, bath, and bedtime, so: everything. The primary parent could ask the other parent for help\nwhenever they wanted, and this was not uncommon and the non-primary parent never said no. This worked great for us, and our son was cool with \"Mommy-days\"\nand \"Daddy-days.\"\n\nHere's the kicker: I got many comments about how great it was that my husband was doing so much childcare. NOT ONCE did I get any comments about how great it was that I was doing EVEN MORE childcare than he was -- since every week had four\nMommy-days and three Daddy-days. \n\nWhenever I got one of these comments, I'd say something like, yes, my husband is a wonderful father and it's great that he does the childcare three days a week -- but I do it four days a week and last I heard, four was greater than three (and I'd remind them that we both worked full-time), so where were the kudos for me for doing even more childcare than my husband? \n\nEvery single person I said this to would look at me like I was insane, and the worst mom on the planet, for asking for praise for taking care of our child. EVEN THOUGH THEY PRAISED MY HUSBAND FOR DOING LESS THAN I DID.\n\nYup, sexism is alive and well. Sigh.", "NTA - That is not your friend. Time to cut that off and move on with your life.", "NTA - she is not your friend if she thinks that way about you.

That's exactly it. She's jealous.\n\nBloody sick of people calling men saints or heroes if they do basic adult shit. Having chores? Oh, who'd be doing them if he lived alone? WATCHING his kids? What the hell is that?

In healthy relationships, there are times when one partner needs to do a little more or roles need to be adjusted to reflect what is happening in their lives.
