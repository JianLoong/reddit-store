I offered. \n\nMy husband and I are muslim, my friends are not. It's ramadan but I'm pregnant, and our daughter is only 4 years old so my husband is the only one who is fasting this month. I'm also on maternity leave so I'm pretty much at home most of the time. \n\nMy husband and I generally split cooking, doing the dishes etc. Our division of chores have not changed during ramadan because even if I were fasting, we would still have to cook 3 times a day for our daughter. For example, when my husband makes lunch or breakfast it'd generally be for me and our daughter but when we had guests it included them as well. And obviously our iftar meal would be for everyone. Same situation when I cook. I make breakfast and lunch for myself, our daughter and guests, iftar meal for everyone. \n\nAfter they leave, my friend sends me a message, thanking us for letting them stay at our place. She specifically thanks my husband for all the amazing meals and company while he must be exhausted, and that he was such an amazing dad and husband for doing so much work during Ramadan. \n\nThe tone of the message sounded a bit odd to me, but I just brushed it off. However recently one of our mutual friends told me that my friend said my husband is a saint for \"doing so much work when he must be so tired while I don't pull my weight. He cooks, cleans, does the laundry and even looks after the kid when she goes out at night.\".  \n\nI guess this made my friend think that I'm lazy, because who makes their husband who is fasting do chores? I guess she thought I should be the one doing all the cooking and the cleaning because I'm not fasting, so I must be having an easier time than him. \n\nIt didn't matter that I was cooking half the time, it's not enough apparently. Also my husband and I alternate days for going to the mosque for taraweeh, which is the explanation for the \"when she goes out at night\" bit. \n\nI feel a bit upset, and I did send her a message asking whether everything is alright. She replied saying our mutual friend shouldn't have told me what she told her in confidence, but that she stands by everything that she's said. I'm honestly a bit upset.

Wow\u2014some friends you have. How things are divided between you and your husband is your business. But also, you are growing a human and it seems they didn\u2019t take that into account.

I would email back and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry that a marriage where the husband puts in equal labour is so strange to you that it actually worries you.

While your guests stayed with you, both yourself and your husband carried on with your normal routine, where you both shared the cooking and other household chores and go to taraweeh?

She should be grateful that you extended the invitation, not talking about you behind your back. You are pregnant.

She was happy to accept hospitality when her accomodation fell through but took it upon herself to involve herself by commenting on another couple's relationship.
