The irony is, the mom tattled to your mom. And neither your mom nor your dad realized the hypocrisy in that, while simultaneously lecturing you about \u2018tattling\u2019. \n\nAlso, racism needs to be reported. Your mom\u2019s an ah, as are the girls, and the other mom. \n\nAlso, it sounds like racism isn\u2019t their only problem. Calling the teacher a C? That\u2019s super concerning. Her parents know she has a problem that is big enough to have suspensions and therapy, so they know what she\u2019s like. But her mom still called to complain about you, which is bullshit.", "NTA.  But your mom is.  She's as racist as the girls that got suspended. The girls are repeat offenders who displayed horrible behavior, and your mom is all concerned for their feelings.\n\nIt's like the star quarterback who SAs an unpopular girl and everyone is like, \"He's got such a bright future. It would be a shame to ruin it over one mistake!\"", "The parents aren't doing everything they can to make the girl less mean. They are still allowing her to be in a racist friend group. They are trying to minimize the behavior by interfering with school consequences. They are coming after you (the victim) through your mom. I'd guess the parents are where the bully/racist girl got her ideas. NTA", "NTA. Also props to the teacher who took quick and decisive action. Your parents are just trying to keep things smooth and peaceful, even if it means that someone else gets hurt. Lots of people do that, and it's part of why the world really sucks sometimes. \n\n\"Tattling\" and \"standing up to bigots\" are not the same thing. You took a moral stand here and should be proud of yourself.", "NTA, but your mom sure is. I hope you show her this at some point in the future so your mom learns that she has been judged and found wanting (in terms of basic humanity and empathy).", "The fact that any parent would actively teach their child to ignore bigotry is beyond my comprehension\u2026 A minor joke is one thing, but a run of jokes or the dog eating comment (which is not a joke) becomes unacceptable. To proceed after being shut down makes it more necessary that the perpetrators be reprimanded. Failing your classes (because you\u2019re too busy being a stupid bully) is not a free pass to be a bad person. On the contrary, it should make you want to be a nicer person, since most people won\u2019t want anything to do with you if you\u2019re both dumb and mean; only other stupid people.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Your parents are wrong. The girl\u2019s mother is wrong. The three girls were total AHs. Only your teacher reacted appropriately to this situation.", "As an Asian person currently living in a predominantly white country, I sincerely like to shake your hand. Not sure if your parents actually understand  how racism works and how their lax attitude is enabling it, but you (and your teacher) seemed like good, decent person. NTA. Please ask your parents why they don't have a problem with their friend's daughter needing a lesson on basic human decency.\n\nAlso, regardless of whether that girl was going through 'hardship' (read:bullsh*t), does not give them a licence to be racist.", "NTA. They\u2019re awful and there are zero tolerance policies for a reason. You actually did them a favor, teaching them this lesson now.

Is racist AF.", "NTA everyone is going through something its not a license for unethical or immoral behavior that they know is wrong", "NTA. Your mom and dad are racist if they defend racism. Absolutely keep reporting racism and bullying. Hate and harassment do not have to be physical to harm someone or push them to unalive themselves. You did not \u201ctattle\u201d on them.

The OP has 2 awful parents.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA they are clearly racist. The teacher and the school were having none of it and your mom and dad are awful for defending their actions and generally saying its not a big deal. Does your mom even know clearly what happened? Or did she just hear a \"lesser\" version from the girls mom?", "They lost any right to empathy when they chose racism, and I think the problem isn't going to be rectified by therapy when the girls are all attached at the hip.

Don't take that crap from anyone. Your parents are wrong on this one. Maybe, just maybe, those girls will think twice before being so obnoxious.", "NTA you don't use racism as a outlet for your stress unless you're a racist.

Better they find out now that this isn't acceptable than when they're adults.", "God I forget just how hideous middle school kids can be. NTA, their racist asses need to be taught a lesson.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is the TA for telling you to shrug off racism against Japanese people and especially jokes on Asian eyes is very offensive. \n\nI had three girls in middle school make fun of my ethnic vegetarian food that my mom made for me every day. And for using my hands to eat the food. They called me Typhoid Mary for the rest of the year. As well as calling my culture backwards and barbaric. \n\nWhen I showed them the house I lived with my grandparents, they called me poor and classless that I lived as a joint family with aunts and grandparents. \n\nI called them out on their BS, when they used their hands to eat pizza and fries by asking them to use forks to eat the dish. They said no, so I countered their logic back to them, that they used to insult me. \n\nThey used to make fun of me for not being able to pronounce Kansas and Iowa right. Called me lots of names for not having \u201cproper\u201d English. I did not have any idea of politics, slang or the references they used. \n\nAfter that, I had my own table to eat my food in peace. I ate with my hands and rarely used spoon or fork, except for eating salad. \n\nSo, yes, when I came to US, I did face instances of bullying. It hurt as an immigrant, it hurt that no one my age at that time saw why I was struggling. I was young and I\u2019m in an unknown country far away from my family, I can\u2019t understand a word of English and they expect me to catch onto everything American related quickly?\n\nI had some kind souls help me out. The librarians were the only ones who understood and gave me books to improve my English. My eighth grade teacher helped me assimilate by letting me redo the essays and taught me all the slangs and pop culture afterschool. And the dos and don\u2019ts like privacy, personal space and independence. \n\nThese girls deserve suspension. In my case, it took till I fought back during gym class to have my bullies suspended. I pulled her hair and left a bald spot in my attempt to fight back because she was pinning me down and I pulled at her hair and completely ripped it so she would let me go. \n\nThe school determined that I had acted out of instinct. She got suspended and had to wear a wig for the rest of the year. \n\nThis is my personal experience. I did have a nice group of supportive Americans in college and grad school though. \n\nIf you see any more instances of bullying, please don\u2019t stay silent. No one stood up for me till I fought back. My mom got me some nice food for fighting back. \n\nIt will start out like this, taunts and insults. Then it would turn physical, she almost choked me in the locker room. It takes a toll on you. \n\nThank you for standing up. The world needs more people like you.", "Sorry, but I think your mom is very much in the wrong here.  \n\nYou can have lots empathy for someone who has problems. That doesn't mean that you should tolerate the person's bad behavior, especially racist or bigoted behavior.  Tolerating it gives the person a terrible message, the message that the awful things they're saying are OK with others. That they're OK with you.\n\nGoing to the teacher was the right thing to do. Behavior has consequences.  The people who did something wrong are the two girls, not you.\n\nNTA", "NTA .
