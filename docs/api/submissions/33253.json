My husband passed away recently, and we had this beautiful wedding jewelry set that was gifted to me by him. Now, his family is pressuring me to give it back, but it's not as simple as it sounds.\n\nFirst off, the jewelry wasn't some family heirloom; it was a gift from my husband. He knew I came from a less affluent background, and he always tried to make me feel comfortable in his world. The jewelry set was a symbol of our love and commitment, not just a shiny accessory.\n\nThe real issue here is the strained relationship I've had with my in-laws from the start. My husband was from a wealthy family, and they never fully accepted me because of my modest background. They were always polite, but you could sense the judgment and the subtle digs.\n\nNow, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law are insisting that I return the jewelry set. They claim it holds sentimental value to the family, but I can't shake the feeling that it's more about their disdain for me than any genuine sentiment. I'm stuck in this moral dilemma \u2013 do I honor my late husband's family wishes, or do I hold onto this piece that means so much to me?\n\nThe tension has escalated to the point where they're threatening legal action, and I'm afraid I might end up losing something that means the world to me. On one hand, I want to respect my husband's memory and our relationship, but on the other, I don't want to be seen as the villain in this family drama.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for standing my ground and keeping the wedding jewelry set, or should I just give in to my in-laws' demands and avoid making a difficult situation even worse?\n\nFirst Edit/Update: I made a mistake in my story. The jewelry set was picked out and paid for by my husband but my sister-in-law collected it for him it give it to me.\n\nSecond Edit/Update: Thank you guys for the advice. Thus situation has been putting me under a lot of stress. It's even worse when trying to plan a funeral. My friends have taken some of the funeral load because of my health being at risk. I'm going to get a lawyer right after the funeral this Wednesday.\n\nThird Edit/Update: I took you guys advice and searched through his study to find the receipt/invoice for the set. I found it in a file in his safe. It contains all the details of the purchase, including things that I didn't even know. I took it and the set and plan to give it to one of my friends so they can't get access to. By the way, no, my in-laws don't have any spare keys or access to our home. I have 8ft walls around our yard, cameras and security system. We also have neighbourhood watch chat just in case of any suspicious activity. Also his will was read the day after his death. It stated I was the sole beneficiary of all his assets, before and during our marriage. That includes our home, cars, investments, etc.", "created_utc": 1702861641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kwfqh/aita_for_not_returning_my_deceased_husbands/", "score": 2655, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They wanted it, and more importantly, they didn't want her to have it. She never got it back. \n\nFor the time being, consider moving all easily portable valuables into a safe location like the safe custody room at your lawyer's office, or a bank box.
