HE abandoned his toddlers at the pool so HE could go get drunk.  What he did is incredibly unsafe, and he should not be taking his children to pools if he isn't watching them.  So, you know, they don't drown.  Don't feel bad, you have done absolutely nothing wrong.  If this happens again, don't bother waiting to call the cops.  Call immediately, because unsupervised children around water can easily die.  I did some lifeguarding when I was younger, and you should be the last line of defence, not the first.

He was negligent.", "NTA\n\nWas the plan to bring the kids back home totally hamered after a day at the bar ?", "NTA. The only thing I might suggest doing differently is calling the cops earlier - once you realized they were totally unaccompanied during the day, it would be appropriate to call and report child abandonment. You are not a child-care provider, and this was a really unsafe decision by the dad.", "Definitely NTA. He did abandon for an entire day so he could drink and then take them home. You 100% did the right thing.", "NTA. You should not have done anything differently other than not calling the cops immediately. The father was lucky that you were gracious enough to allow him the twenty minutes that you did. No one is allowed to drink and drive. Full stop. You potentially just saved multiple lives by stopping this disgusting excuse for a father from leaving with those poor kids. Who in the hell leaves 4 and 5 year old kids alone NEAR WATER???? The negligence and entitlement here is appalling. I'm so sorry for those kids. \n\nThank you for notifying the authorities. CPS needs to know that this is going on in that home.

Hopefully the super dad wasn't thinking of driving them home, in which case glad you did call the police.", "Honestly as a life guard in the 80s a lot of parents used the pool for free babysitting - but generally only for kids more like 8-11 who could swim well.

Leaving a 12-13 year old would technically be younger than allowed but if they're good swimmers, sure. But a 4 and 5 year old?!?!? Straight up negligence.", "He had beer on his breath.  He wasn\u2019t safe to drive them.  NTA and thanks for looking out for them!", "They have much bigger problems, obviously", "Also you prevented them go with a drunk dad (especially if he intended to drive) may have saved them.", "NTA.

Maybe parent(s) chose not to bring them... but maybe CPS intervened and they were placed with other family. Maybe they moved, or went to a different pool.

I'd assume it's really difficult to keep a 4 and 5 year old with you without anyone noticing they're kidnapped. \n\nAs for pools? One doesn't fuck with that shit. Kids need to learn how to swim with their clothes on before they go in a pool unsupervised. It's far far far too easy to drown in a pool as a kid.

Then double that chance.....", "Lifeguards are there to save people from drowning, not to babysit kids", "The lifeguard doesn\u2019t know who came with the kids.

By the time they notice they\u2019re not going to meet their dad, they\u2019re out and away from the pool and the lifeguard isn\u2019t watching them.\n\nPeople who have an interest in this sort of thing keep an eye on unaccompanied kids.\n\nThe biggest risk is from the water itself, but it isn\u2019t too remote that they could have been a missing persons report too.", "NTA but I understand your guilt, I mean, those kids could be in a much worse situation now.

This man is not responsible, he was drunk and left his near toddler aged children  unsupervised and alone in a public pool to go get drunk.\n\nIf the kids got taken away from him it\u2019s not your fault- They were in the custody of an unsafe, neglectful parent.\n\nIf you suspect a child is in danger it\u2019s much better to speak up than just hope it\u2019s nothing and being proved wrong in the worst possible way.", "I'm far more concerned about the potential drunk driving issue. How was he getting them home from the pool?", "Surprised the police didn\u2019t breath-test him on the spot, before he even started his car \u2026", "I always wondered whether kids actually would just follow a stranger, after all the educating and focus on kidnapping\u2026 and what are the actual stats? How many kids actually get taken?", "Sorry, this is ridiculous. A vanishingly small number of children are kidnapped by strangers in the US", "NTA. I work at a library and parents try to pull this all of the time. They send the kids, under 13 and below, up to the children floor. \u201cMa\u2019am/Sir, your children need to be supervised.\u201d I have had to explain multiple times that staff aren\u2019t babysitters. In OP\u2019s case daddo leaving not only could have come back finding the kids drowned but what if someone decided to take those kids home! I really don\u2019t like people. \u2639\ufe0f", "NTA, that's very foolish and dangerous for him to leave his kids alone in the pool, even when there's a lifeguard. He is an AH for leaving his kids like that and expecting you to be a babysitter.", "NTA. MY GOD. this gave me an feeling of panic to read. Not only could those little kids drown, get freaking kidnapped, but mr. beer breath was gonna drive them home?? You\u2019re in zero way the asshole here. The dad was being horrible and irresponsible. I don\u2019t know one other adult who\u2019d be totally cool leaving preschool aged kids alone.", "NTA\n\nHe did abandon his kids in a place that isn't safe for their age. If he hired someone to watch them, it would be alright, but he plopped them in the water and went to get drunk. He sounds like a horrible father", "NTA, it's not like you had any way of knowing if or when anyone would show up to pick them up.  They had already been left there, against the rules that you have concerning children that young. For all you knew, they had been abandoned.", "Nooooooooope, NTA, and you should have also called CPS (although the cops probably did anyway). I\u2019m a former child protection worker, and you wee not at all in the wrong here.", "NTA", "Even if the father had come back before the pool closed, he would have been putting their lives in danger. Yes there was a lifeguard there (you), but that same lifeguard has to watch *everyone* and can't be expected to be able to giving this 4 and 5 year old the kind of attention that safety demands at their age.\n\nNTA", "Also to add to your comment, he shouldn't be drinking and driving with them either.", "It\u2019s *very* easy to kidnap a kid that age. Just go up to a little kid and say, \u201cyour mom told me to pick you up\u201d and most of them will just go with you. Take them to a van, give them a lollipop with some sleep medication, and then sell them off to a trafficker.  Or abuse them, or kill them, or pimp them out, or what have you.\n\nThe US freaks out about kidnapping because we learned about this in the 80s when there was an epidemic of missing children and serial killers. You scoff, but I hope your country never sees what ours did then.", "I was at a childrens\u2019 museum once.  A woman was freaking out because her 3-yr old grandson just took off and she couldn\u2019t find him.  I saw him hiding a few minutes later, and told him, \u201chey, your grandma is looking for you.  Can you come with me to go find her?\u201d  He took my hand and calmly walked with me and we found his grandmother. I could have walked out the door with him and no one would have noticed.", "It\u2019s not just an American thing, and it\u2019s not just recent. Look up the case of the Beaumont children in Australia.", "\u2026when most kids are supervised by their parents or teachers until they\u2019re old enough to reliably understand stranger danger. \n\nHow many kids go missing when you control for supervision at young ages?", "It might be small, but imagine if it were your child.  I work in a small town, and we recently received a report that someone was trying to lure 7-8 yr old boys into his truck a few weeks ago.", "5 and 4???? Left alone even after closing??? NTA NTA NTA. Those kids could have drowned, been kidnapped, anything!", "NTA.  This is absolutely worthy of a cps or police call.  Hopefully, the police will get cps involved.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately, some parents are confusing a lifeguard as a babysitter.  Parents are going to the pool to socializing (drinking) and not watch their children.\n\nSorry this happened to you", "NTA. If something happened to those kids how would you be able to contact their father.", "NTA NTA NTA. If the rule is that children cannot be unaccompanied, then he failed. A pool is the last place to consider as a free babysitter, especially with children under the age of 15. He's just upset that you called him out on leaving his kids alone. You did the right thing to have police be alerted that he is okay with leaving his small children alone at a pool being watched by a stranger, while he is drinking alcohol elsewhere.", "NTA.\n\n1. They were unsupervised when you found them.\n\n2. He's drunk, belligerent, and apparently negligent enough to think leaving two very young children unsupervised at a public pool is acceptable. They could easily have drowned, wandered off, gotten kidnapped, etc. They didn't need to leave with him.", "That's not a bad thing under the circumstances. Hopefully they have another parent or family member who has their head on straight."]}
