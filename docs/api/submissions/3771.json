And you are not a professional nanny.  Forget that there was a swimming pool involved.   This father abandoned his children.  That he came back later (drunk) to try to retrieve them means nothing.  You were 100% correct in calling the police.", "NTA.  You had no idea when or if the father would return and not only did he break the rules of the pool he left very young children alone in a dangerous environment.  Who knows what other dangerous places this \"father of the year\" is leaving his children so he can go get his beer fix.", "Nta. You\u2019re a paid life guard at a pool not an after hours baby sitter. 4+5 year olds are just babies and should have NEVER been left alone to begin with- let alone at a pool. You did the right thing because chances are this isn\u2019t the first time the kids were left alone.", "NTA - You couldn't know it would only be ten minutes. If the kids were older I would be willing to give a bit more grace, but 4 & 5 are far too young - and in a pool of all places! Those kids could've gotten into serious danger in just ten minutes. They shouldn't have been left at all, and the dad coming back so quickly doesn't negate that. You were right to be so concerned.", "4 and 5?\n\nThese situations are no joke. If anything bad happened to any of the kids, the judge would probably find it a fitting punishment to make you and the dad share one prison cell for a long time.\n\nNTA", "Maybe dad doesn't understand why lifeguards exist, but kids die in pools.  4 and 5 are young enough that they may not be strong swimmers or fully understand the risks they are taking.  Plus, when he finally does show up, he has clearly been drinking and presumably was going to drive them home at an unknown level of intoxication.  Getting the police involved was the best thing you could have done.  NTA", "NTA. The dad was drunk. Are you really questioning your decision?", "Thanks, I really feel sorry for the kids. And they didn't show up again in the pool and I have the feeling it's my fault they had no more pool for the summer...", "an alcoholic, neglectful and abusive parent is the sort of parent who does that.   \n\n\nOP You are NTA.  In fact, you should have called the PD the second you realized the kids were there unsupervised.", "You are right. I should have, I was worried and tired and didn't think about it. Thanks.", "If their dad didn\u2019t get his shit together, it\u2019s for the best they had no more pool. 5 and 4? They could easily drown or be kidnapped or have something horrible happen to them. And you may be there to prevent the drowning, but you wouldn\u2019t know if a strange man taking them away was their dad or not.", "Honestly you did the kids a favor, a pool is a very dangerous place for an unsupervised 4 year old.", "> I have the feeling it's my fault\n\nNo.  It's their irresponsible \"father\"'s fault.  HE abandoned his toddlers at the pool so HE could go get drunk.  What he did is incredibly unsafe, and he should not be taking his children to pools if he isn't watching them.  So, you know, they don't drown.  Don't feel bad, you have done absolutely nothing wrong.  If this happens again, don't bother waiting to call the cops.  Call immediately, because unsupervised children around water can easily die.  I did some lifeguarding when I was younger, and you should be the last line of defence, not the first.  The no unsupervised under-14's rule is there for a very good reason, and you should *never* feel bad about enforcing it.", "NTA. Your pool is not a daycare for his kids. \n\nWhat he did was abandon them for the day. He was negligent.", "NTA\n\nWas the plan to bring the kids back home totally hamered after a day at the bar ?", "NTA. The only thing I might suggest doing differently is calling the cops earlier - once you realized they were totally unaccompanied during the day, it would be appropriate to call and report child abandonment. You are not a child-care provider, and this was a really unsafe decision by the dad.", "Definitely NTA. He did abandon for an entire day so he could drink and then take them home. You 100% did the right thing.", "NTA. You should not have done anything differently other than not calling the cops immediately. The father was lucky that you were gracious enough to allow him the twenty minutes that you did. No one is allowed to drink and drive. Full stop. You potentially just saved multiple lives by stopping this disgusting excuse for a father from leaving with those poor kids. Who in the hell leaves 4 and 5 year old kids alone NEAR WATER???? The negligence and entitlement here is appalling. I'm so sorry for those kids. \n\nThank you for notifying the authorities. CPS needs to know that this is going on in that home. If he did this at your pool, how many other risks has he taken with his children's well-being? He is a degenerate alcoholic. You choose not to enable that. You did the right thing.", "NTA - no way are you the asshole and you did the right thing.  Maybe if the kids were a little older (over 10 yrs old) then MAYBE I could see letting them go to the pool by themselves, but not to be left there alone while I'm down at the bar.  That's methed up!!", "NTA", "NTA.  I'm hoping you didn't see the kids or the father anymore because they were removed from the home!  This man left a 4 and 5 year old alone at a pool!!!  Oh yeah, he didn't abandon them - the was at the nearest bar.  Unbelievable.", "NTA x100. That guy abandoned his children at a place they could easily have died. Plus he comes back to get them late and drunk.", "Those babies were left alone in a pool all day so their father could go and drink. That is unacceptable and just negligent behavior. You called the cops like you're supposed to because those children could have been abandoned for all you know. The rules clearly stated that no one under 14 can be allowed, and it was closing time. That's what you do when parents don't come to get their kids. You call the cops. Unfortunately, when I worked in daycares, this had to happen. Sometimes, I'm sorry you had to experience that, but you did nothing wrong. Hopefully those kids are safe. nta", "NTA. Lifeguard of more than 15 years and every facility I have worked at has had the written policy that children left unattended 15 minutes after close were to be given to the care of proper authorities, i.e police. \n\nNext time though record the license plate number and report him for drunk driving with kids in the car to 911. You should never try to detain adults, it can put you in a lot of danger. Yes we want to keep kids safe, but I\u2019d never ask or want my employee to put themselves in a position where there might be injured or targeted. \n\nDefinitely check in with your supervisor on how they want you to handle it in the future. They should have a very clear policy on how to handle unaccompanied children.", "NTA - you probably saved those kids from getting in the car with a drunk driver.  He is a negligent parent at best.", "My nieces (3 and 5) can swim circles around me and I never let them go farther than a couple feet. NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nThat dad was putting his kids in danger so he can go get drunk in the nearest bar... The situation in itself is quite clear that police needed to be called.", "NTA\nThis guy sounds like a really poor parent", "NTA.  you would be the AH if you don\u00b4t call the police", "NTA - when the alternative is \u201cMan arrested for negligent homicide after found in bar next to public pool where 5 y/o drowned\u201d you do what you have to. \n\nThat man was AT BEST negligent.", "NTA maybe you saved them from having their lives further endangered by getting driven home by a drunk. Hopefully they weren\u2019t there again because they were in a safer environment.", "NTA, That sounds like an incredibly neglectful parent, and what happened at the pool is probably only the tip of the iceberg. I hope the police officers took it seriously and really investigated the situation perhaps called CPS.", "OP=NTA\n\nAs soon as you knew they were left alone, you should have called the Police.\n\nThe father broke the rules, created liability for the Public Pool and endangered his children.\n\nPLUS he made you work for free after your shift was over, babysitting his children.\n\nFor you personally, the liability issue is the biggest thing--What if they got hurt and he tried to sue you?  Someone like this takes no personal responsibility.  Also, he was probably legally intoxicated at this point. Was he walking home(I Hope)?\n\nBe glad they haven't been back, this situation would have only got worse.  Hopefully, those kids are safe.", "NTA here that would be a call to child protection especially when he showed up with alcohol on his breath", "NTA. Then who knows what the drive home while he\u2019s intoxicated would have gone. You\u2019re an angel. You saved them.", "I was a lifeguard during HS and college, parents treat you like a captive babysitter and try and leave their kids all the time. We would just immediately eject the kid with the parent when we saw them leaving.", "You needed to call the police!!", "Sounds like he was gonna drunk drive them home.  NTA", "NTA.  Hopefully your contacting them triggers a CPS report as those children are neglected.", "If you had not called he would have driven them home drunk. Likely CPS will be involved to make sure the children will be properly supervised in the future, which is good. You could have saved 3 lives. You did good. NTA", "NTA. Surprised you waited that long. Hopefully the super dad wasn't thinking of driving them home, in which case glad you did call the police.", "Honestly as a life guard in the 80s a lot of parents used the pool for free babysitting - but generally only for kids more like 8-11 who could swim well. They were always picked up before closing though. That was a tough situation to handle and I don\u2019t think you made a bad choice. NTA", "NTA You did absolutely the right thing - particularly since the dad turned up with beer breath.", "WTF?\n\nYou waited TOO LONG to call the police. You should have calmed the minute you noticed a freaking 4 year old was alone at the pool. There is no ambiguity here. You messed up A LOT.", "Similar, as a by today's standards feral child in the early 80s, my Mom would let me and a few friends bike to the pool together starting around age 8, once we'd passed our swim lessons. \n\nI would NEVER have been left unguarded at the pool that young though, and if pool rules had required an adult, she would have respected that.\n\nNTA here, I would have been tempted to report as soon as I knew the kids had been left without the required supervision.", "I'm absolutely blown away at their ages. Leaving a 12-13 year old would technically be younger than allowed but if they're good swimmers, sure. But a 4 and 5 year old?!?!? Straight up negligence.", "He had beer on his breath.  He wasn\u2019t safe to drive them.  NTA and thanks for looking out for them!", "They have much bigger problems, obviously", "Also you prevented them go with a drunk dad (especially if he intended to drive) may have saved them."]}
