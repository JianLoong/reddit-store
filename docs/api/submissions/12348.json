Or at least say something like, \"oh, not mine, but mom's right here and she's raised a great kid I love to support\" or something. Either take the detachment farther and praise mom for raising good kids that you come out and support, or call them a stepkid. We all know stepkids are stepkids and what that means. GF would likely prefer that, tbh.\n\nI'm a step-parent, about as much as you are. My stepkids are my boyfriend's, and they both have different moms. We are not married, but we've been living together for a while now. They might not be my kids genetically, but in the same situation I just say, \"she's my step-kid.\" The reason that sounds better, is because you're claiming the kid while acknowledging that you're not biologically responsible for it. It creates a separation, while still claiming the kid.", "ESH.\n\nYou\u2019re going to be in these kids\u2019 lives for more years, yes?\n\nYou need to be a lot more tactful.

Keep in mind that as a mom, she needs to look out for the best interest of her children. Why would being with a man who avidly rejects the notion of being their dad be something she's okay with?", "NTA   I get why this is an awkward question. On one hand you don\u2019t want to overstep and claim a relationship that is not 100% technically true, but on the other hand all the stranger wanted to know/do is make small talk with some other parents - not get to the bottom of your familial relationships. Anna is \u201cyours\u201d in the sense that you weren\u2019t just there cheering on some strange teenager ~ the kid lives with you, and has done for most of her life.

Those poor kids had to grow up without a dad, because you never acted like one. No wonder they don\u2019t see you that way. You are like, the prime example of a shitty step-dad.\n\nThe fact that they aren\u2019t blood related to you means nothing if you were dating their mom for almost their entire lives.

I\u2019m not saying you have to be or be called their father, but dating a woman with 2 children when you don\u2019t like kids enough that you have this reaction is a choice you made freely.

Can you imagine how that might make them feel? If you're with their mom for a decent amount of time enough for it to be a serious relationship then they are your kids, whether you want them or not, because when you date their mom the kids come with it. Just my opinion.", "YTA. She asked if you were the parents. She didn't ask if you were the bio dad. Dude you've been with these kids for 12 yrs.

You have been in their lives for 12 years and the 'father' figure in the household for 9. I really think they should mean more to you than 'your girlfriend's kids' at this point.  \nLook at it from the other side. Imagine your Dad wasn't in the picture but your stepdad was ever since you were 6. If when you're 15 someone asked him in public \"Is this your son?\", and he abjectly denies it.

Understandable if they don't call you dad, so it's just as likely they would get up upset if your refer to yourself as their dad before she did.\n\nBut you should have a family conversation about what role you play in their family to avoid this happening again, if you are confused as an adult imagine how confusing it is for the kids.", "YTA.

In my opinion if the kids don\u2019t care and are happy and comfortable that\u2019s all that matters. Maybe i\u2019m weird but I grew up with cousins who didn\u2019t start calling their step mom, \u201cmom\u201d until two years ago.

I don't see anything wrong with your relationship with them by itself as you describe it. The problem is you *went out of your way* to clarify she was not your daughter. That's ugly because it *sounds* like you hate the idea so much that you couldn't bring yourself to just give the socially acceptable \"yeah\" reply.\n\nStill, I kind of get it and I don't think it's super serious (definitely A-holish though). I also have the \"bad habit\" of wanting to use the exact correct terms when talking even when it's unimportant/not socially the best option.

My dad was with my stepmom for 10 years after my mom died, and is and was a nice woman, but more like a favorite Aunt than a mother, because that's what my brother and I wanted. It would have been rude for her to start calling me her daughter, because that's not how I wanted our relationship to work. I'm glad that you got what you wanted but not everyone is like you.", "Yes I'm a \"father\" figure for them but they still don't see me as their dad and that's fine for all of us.

At maybe age 10, my reaction was definitely not \"oh cool, not personal then\", it was more like \"why does my parent care so little about his kids that he chose a partner who does not like kids\". \n\nIt did not have, uh, good long-term effects on those relationships.", "The problem, for me, is how he responded, especially using \u201cjust\u201d.

Are you the direct biologic progenitor to that kid? Are you the legal guardian to that kid? Are you the generally accepted, informally responsible person for this child?\n\nPut yourself on a different role. \n\nIf this was your niece, would you say \u201cno, she\u2019s not mine; she\u2019s my sister\u2019s kid\u201d?

We make assumptions about what people mean about the question all the time. That doesn\u2019t make those assumptions correct.\n\nYou do have a relationship with the child; you live with them and interact with them most days.

Lol.", "I don't think you were being malicious just honestly answered and there is nothing wrong with that. Do the kids even call you dad?", "I think the difference in my situation was a) I didn't know my stepdad didn't want kids until I was an adult myself, and b) his reason for not wanting kids wasn't that he didn't like them (he did, he was a teacher) but that he knew he couldn't handle the worry and anxiety that comes with parenthood.  I really respected that.  I think not wanting kids doesn't inherently mean you don't like kids.  It's ok to not want kids but to enjoy being around them.", "Yeah it seems it.

My complaint isn't that the posts aren't real. My problem is that the judgement is so obvious and low effort and terrible creative writing.\n\nIf someone makes up a scenario and posts it, but its nuanced and occupies a gray area and legitimately splits the community on judgement, I enjoy that. Its a testament to the poster's talent for writing and creativity. Things like this just make me think asshole, whether its real or not.\n\nDo better either way.", "I don\u2019t see it as minimizing though, just for clarification. Him saying:\n\nOther person: so is that your daughter\nHim: no, that\u2019s her kid, not mine\n\nThat kind of sounds worse to me. I guess tone would matter here. But I don\u2019t see the reason for lying to strangers.

When we first started dating I was very clear I wanted nothing to do with being a parent, that I wasn\u2019t someone he could count on for anything for his kid, if he was looking for a stepmom he needed to look elsewhere.

But just because she doesn't call you Dad, doesn't suddenly mean you aren't seen as one. I mean, jfc, you're literally in her drawn out family pictures. Of course she views you as a father - there was just never the expectation to call you anything other than your name.\n\nLet's say you did get married? Would you suddenly expect her to call you pa? Probably not.
