Or at least say something like, \"oh, not mine, but mom's right here and she's raised a great kid I love to support\" or something. Either take the detachment farther and praise mom for raising good kids that you come out and support, or call them a stepkid. We all know stepkids are stepkids and what that means. GF would likely prefer that, tbh.\n\nI'm a step-parent, about as much as you are. My stepkids are my boyfriend's, and they both have different moms. We are not married, but we've been living together for a while now. They might not be my kids genetically, but in the same situation I just say, \"she's my step-kid.\" The reason that sounds better, is because you're claiming the kid while acknowledging that you're not biologically responsible for it.

Anna is \u201cyours\u201d in the sense that you weren\u2019t just there cheering on some strange teenager ~ the kid lives with you, and has done for most of her life.

Those poor kids had to grow up without a dad, because you never acted like one. No wonder they don\u2019t see you that way. You are like, the prime example of a shitty step-dad.\n\nThe fact that they aren\u2019t blood related to you means nothing if you were dating their mom for almost their entire lives.

I\u2019m not saying you have to be or be called their father, but dating a woman with 2 children when you don\u2019t like kids enough that you have this reaction is a choice you made freely.

You have been in their lives for 12 years and the 'father' figure in the household for 9. I really think they should mean more to you than 'your girlfriend's kids' at this point.  \nLook at it from the other side.

Are you the direct biologic progenitor to that kid? Are you the legal guardian to that kid? Are you the generally accepted, informally responsible person for this child?\n\nPut yourself on a different role. \n\nIf this was your niece, would you say \u201cno, she\u2019s not mine; she\u2019s my sister\u2019s kid\u201d? No, even though it\u2019s be more appropriate than what you did. If it were your niece, you would acknowledge your connection to the kid by saying \u201cthat\u2019s my niece; we\u2019re so proud of her!\u201d You would not deny the relation *to the child directly*.\n\nIf you were a nanny, and they asked if that was your kid, it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say \u201cno; she\u2019s my employer\u2019s kid\u201d from a factual perspective, but it is sure as shit weird, and not addressing your relation to the child. You\u2019d say \u201cI\u2019m her nanny; she\u2019s doing really well!\u201d You\u2019d correct the possible assumption of biological relation (because you\u2019re not wrong that it can be implied) but you are affirming your relationship with the child they asked about, rather than denying it and, at most, putting it removed and through another person.\n\nThe question is asking for information on how you are connected to the kid; that\u2019s all. We make assumptions about what people mean about the question all the time. That doesn\u2019t make those assumptions correct.\n\nYou do have a relationship with the child; you live with them and interact with them most days. Whether it\u2019s one more like a parent, more like a coworker, or more like a roommate, you have a relationship with the kid. The fact that you first and foremost went to denying that is what makes you the asshole.", "But it\u2019s not their kid. OP was telling the truth.
