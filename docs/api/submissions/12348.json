Or at least say something like, \"oh, not mine, but mom's right here and she's raised a great kid I love to support\" or something. Either take the detachment farther and praise mom for raising good kids that you come out and support, or call them a stepkid. We all know stepkids are stepkids and what that means. GF would likely prefer that, tbh.\n\nI'm a step-parent, about as much as you are. My stepkids are my boyfriend's, and they both have different moms. We are not married, but we've been living together for a while now. They might not be my kids genetically, but in the same situation I just say, \"she's my step-kid.\" The reason that sounds better, is because you're claiming the kid while acknowledging that you're not biologically responsible for it. It creates a separation, while still claiming the kid.", "ESH.\n\nYou\u2019re going to be in these kids\u2019 lives for more years, yes?\n\nYou need to be a lot more tactful.

One one hand you don\u2019t want to overstep and claim a relationship that is not 100% technically true, but on the other hand all the stranger wanted to know/do is make small talk with some other parents - not get to the bottom of your familial relationships. Anna is \u201cyours\u201d in the sense that you weren\u2019t just there cheering on some strange teenager ~ the kid lives with you, as has done for most of her life.

You have been in their lives for 12 years and the 'father' figure in the household for 9. I really think they should mean more to you than 'your girlfriend's kids' at this point.  \nLook at it from the other side.

She might be cool with it or it might absolutely cut her up.", "Yeah you don't have to like kids in general and can care about your own in sync with that, but, how do the kids feel?  Do they love him?  If they do does he love them back or just going through the motions.  \n\nMy experience (I know there are lots of scenarios), is that my husband currently loves his step daughter, calls her his step daughter, and my daughter has said she wants to change her name because she loves him more than her own dad.  \n\nIt sounds like the wife really wants like a family unit and he's just like I'm here.  I \"like\" my kids, but I don't \"love\" them, is how I have interpreted this post.\n\nHe's not wrong, maybe just needs to revaluate his role in all this?", "I gather from para 2 that the children don't view him as Dad either.\n\nAnyhow, the key thing is: the girlfriend needs to take ownership of this situation. She's dating a guy who doesn't want to have kids / her kids. If that's an issue, she needs to break up.\n\nBut I don't hold OP to the same std, because 9 years or 9 months, one can't manufacture feelings. \n\nAs long as he's willing to play a fatherly role, it's okay that he doesn't want to be Dad. It's not okay for the girlfriend to have discovered it just now - it's a conversation she needed to have had with OP a loooong time ago, and have monitored the relationships continuously."]}
