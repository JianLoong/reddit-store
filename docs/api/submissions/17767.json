For the wedding and rehearsal dinner it was important to us to have no kids (less than 18) at either except a couple of our 15-16 year old cousins. I found out recently my parents had invited one of my dads cousins to the rehearsal dinner (she is not invited to wedding) who is around 13 or 14 because one of her parents wouldn\u2019t be able to come to the rehearsal dinner otherwise. (They are out of town guests) This was done without consulting me or my fianc\u00e9 and we have close cousins who we told no they couldn\u2019t bring their kid and those cousins then couldn\u2019t come to rehearsal dinner because of that. We figure an exception can\u2019t be made here as we didn\u2019t make one for our close cousins kids and have therefore asked my parents to uninvite the kid from the event. They obviously are frustrated because I agree inviting and then uninviting someone isn\u2019t the nicest but I have told them they can place all the blame on me.

You get to choose who you want at your wedding. On the other hand, 14 isn't exactly a screaming, disruptive child.

I'd much rather take my 13 year old somewhere cool and have some fun. Listening to adults do boring tall for 3 hours while drinking is not fun for most teens", "Your parents should never have invited this child, no matter who's paying.

Would it really kill you to be kind to this kid?", "NTA. The family from out of town did not receive an invite for the wedding for their kids but brought them anyway knowing one adult would have to stay with the kids which is why your parents extended them an invite without asking. Not invited to the wedding also means not invited to the rehearsal dinner. You could decide to invite only people who have names starting with a vowel if you want and then let in every C name as an exception and it wouldn\u2019t matter. The invite list is the invite list and if you sent a wedding invite for only the adults, then the kids weren\u2019t invited no matter who your parents wanted to ask. \nRegardless of who is paying, it is your wedding and rehearsal and you had agreed to the terms before hand.

You decided to make your wedding 'child free' which is completely within your rights to do so. The rehearsal dinner, however, is hosted by your parents, therefore, they get to decide who can come or not come. They made a decision to allow this teenager to come to the dinner they are hosting, probably because your dad wants to spend some time with members of his family, one of which wouldn't be able to come without the teen.

Many wedding parties now have people who have never met because some of them aren't within striking distance.
