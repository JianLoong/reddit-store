That said, you may cause a scene. (Yes, I get that your mom is the one really causing it, but hear what I'm saying.)\n\nI had something similar happen at a funeral, and it wasn't until it was over that I knew it had happened - it was done quickly and behind my back. If I had a do over, I would have just sat in the back with my mom. The deceased don't care where we're sitting. If you want to bring your dad up front, by all means. You could just sit with him wherever, though.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "Sit with him in back.  If you invite them, would your other siblings join you?", "Absolutely NTA for the sentiment. But be ready for a huge meltdown from your mom. She might cause a scene, so it\u2019s something to consider.", "NTA for sure but you'll have to deal with a lot of drama after. I'm not saying it's fair that you would have to deal with a lot of drama after, but that's the situation. Your mom could start yelling at your dad or creating a scene. She does not sound like someone who reacts well to not being in control. \n\nAnother option is for you to go back and sit with your father at the back, which sends a significant message, I think. Maybe just go with your gut and what feels right. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.", "YWBTA, in terms of optics, if nothing else. \n\nIf you bring your dad to the front, then mom gets to make a scene about him and how badly HE behaved at the funeral. That's not fair to him.\n\nIf you sit in the back with him, then the meltdown will be about YOUR behavior,  which is fair because it's YOUR decision. And that will kick down the door for other people in your family to question why YOU don't think he's a monster. And that starts a conversation your family probably needs to have. \n\nI'm so sorry for the loss of your brother, and I hope this a gateway for your family to heal.", "YWBTA to bring your father to the front family mourners bench and start a ruckus. Far better for you to sit in the back with your father. Let the other mourners and family interpret that as they will.

Sit in the back with dad. Tell anyone who asks that: mom insists that my father, the man who tried to be there for myself and brother, sit in the back.", "NTA\n\nThis is a tough one. You\u2019d be doing right by your father, his family, and yourself to make them feel included, and acknowledged, by inviting them up front.\n\nOn the other hand, it could create a very ugly scene that would leave everyone, yourself included, even more devastated on a very difficult day. \n\nMaybe the best thing you can do for yourself, and your dad\u2019s family, is to embrace them when they are there. Spend time with them. Go find them \u201cin the back\u201d. Be open to them. If you share in each other\u2019s grief and forge a stronger bond, you\u2019ll be honouring yourself, your brother, and your father.\n\nThe most important thing you can do the day of the funeral is give comfort to those sharing in the loss of your brother, and let them comfort you. \n\nYou are all extremely fragile at the moment; spending time being present with each other is what is going to help you find a balm for your grief. It\u2019s ultimately not about where everyone sits or your physical proximity to each other or the service; but how emotionally close you get to each other that day.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss and for your mother\u2019s difficult behaviour. May you find comfort in your family.\n\n(Edited: first sentence for repeated word)", "NTA I\u2019m sorry your bro died. I\u2019m sorry he had a rough go. Your mom sounds exhausting. \n\nYou can take a stance if you\u2019re up for the scene. Personally I\u2019d prefer to remember my brother on the day of his funeral reflectively.  Where everyone is sitting really doesn\u2019t matter much. Your mom controlling those aspects demonstrates a sad, unhinged person at work. Let her crazy shine.
