For the past 3 years, we have been consistently trying for a child. We have been unable to get pregnant until 6 months ago. \nAround this time, my sister (32F), who we\u2019ll call Mary, got engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor. Of course I was delighted and agreed. We started planning some wedding things like her bridal shower, which she wanted to hold on the morning of the baby shower my best friend was planning for me.\n(My sister is well aware of our troubles conceiving and knew that this baby shower was a big deal to me.) \nHowever, my best friend is extremely flexible, and I wanted my sister to be at the shower, so we moved the shower to the next day. \n\nThis past Saturday was supposed to be the wedding shower and Sunday was supposed to be my baby shower. Unfortunately, Seth and I suffered a stillbirth. Of course I didn\u2019t expect the whole family and bridal party to change their plans but I did cancel the baby shower and regretfully informed everyone about the stillbirth. The last week I\u2019ve been pretty upset and depressed, thus, I asked one of the bridesmaids to complete the finishing touches of the bridal shower. She agreed.\n\nOn Friday, I announced the stillbirth and the baby shower being cancelled and I began to return gifts that quite a few people had already sent who wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. Mary called me after she heard about everything and asked that I didn\u2019t return things so that she could have them for her new house as bonus gifts (including things with my son\u2019s name on them.) I told her her no and that I wouldn\u2019t be attending her wedding shower and know my whole family is turning against me. She said that I ruined her bridal shower and that I divided the family. I don\u2019t think I am, but am I the asshole for not letting my sister have my baby\u2019s things and not returning them? Am I the asshole for not going to to my sisters bridal shower since I am grieving and don\u2019t need the dress and judgement?\n\nNote: I found out that I was pregnant before her engagement. The baby shower date had been set before the bridal shower date, we changed the baby shower date because I didn\u2019t want to ask family and friends for gifts 2 times on the same day. (Though I know they would have been happy to do so.)", "created_utc": 1669520864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5qpri/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_bridal_shower/", "score": 1022, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
