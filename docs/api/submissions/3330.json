For the past 3 years, we have been consistently trying for a child. We have been unable to get pregnant until 6 months ago. \nAround this time, my sister (32F), who we\u2019ll call Mary, got engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor. Of course I was delighted and agreed. We started planning some wedding things like her bridal shower, which she wanted to hold on the morning of the baby shower my best friend was planning for me.\n(My sister is well aware of our troubles conceiving and knew that this baby shower was a big deal to me.) \nHowever, my best friend is extremely flexible, and I wanted my sister to be at the shower, so we moved the shower to the next day. \n\nThis past Saturday was supposed to be the wedding shower and Sunday was supposed to be my baby shower. Unfortunately, Seth and I suffered a stillbirth. Of course I didn\u2019t expect the whole family and bridal party to change their plans but I did cancel the baby shower and regretfully informed everyone about the stillbirth. The last week I\u2019ve been pretty upset and depressed, thus, I asked one of the bridesmaids to complete the finishing touches of the bridal shower. She agreed.\n\nOn Friday, I announced the stillbirth and the baby shower being cancelled and I began to return gifts that quite a few people had already sent who wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. Mary called me after she heard about everything and asked that I didn\u2019t return things so that she could have them for her new house as bonus gifts (including things with my son\u2019s name on them.) I told her her no and that I wouldn\u2019t be attending her wedding shower and know my whole family is turning against me. She said that I ruined her bridal shower and that I divided the family. I don\u2019t think I am, but am I the asshole for not letting my sister have my baby\u2019s things and not returning them? Am I the asshole for not going to to my sisters bridal shower since I am grieving and don\u2019t need the dress and judgement?\n\nNote: I found out that I was pregnant before her engagement. The baby shower date had been set before the bridal shower date, we changed the baby shower date because I didn\u2019t want to ask family and friends for gifts 2 times on the same day.

I can't even fathom. Those baby gifts are not hers. They're yours. It's very polite of you to return them - I don't think this was strictly necessary because the *last* concern *anyone* should have right now is whether they get a refund on their gift for a child who didn't survive. You'd be within your rights to put it all in a trunk for a future child, or throw it on a bonfire if that's how you feel. The important thing right now to anyone with a teaspoon of brain cells is *supporting you and your husband as bereaved parents*. SCREW Mary's bridal shower.", "NTA. First, I\u2019m truly sorry for your loss. Your sister is callous to ask for the gifts people gave you for your baby.

NTA! Mary is horrible to not only expect you to still come to the wedding shower after thing trauma but to have the absolute callous nerve to ask for the baby supplies for your deceased child!

Why on earth should she get the gifts from YOUR cancelled baby shower? I think that is a request in the poorest of taste, at the very least. It could be construed as fraud with a meaner mindset. As for not going to her bridal shower, well, I imagine that after having lost a baby you had been hoping for for 6 years, you would be pretty distraught and not in a position to show up with a happy face. Anyone with as much as an ounce of empathy would feel this way. You didn't ruin anything. You suffered a terrible loss, and instead of sympathy and condolences, you are receiving flack. What a bunch of AHs they are. So sorry for your loss.", "No, you\u2019re absolutely NTA. \nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss. \nReturning the gifts is the appropriate thing to do.

I might consider holding off on sending everything back right now though, especially things with a name on them. You might find down the line that it's comforting to have a baby blanket or plushie to hold on to. I know it's a lot right now and clearing everything out can feel like a way to cleanse the space, but it's also worth considering what you may appreciate in the future. Maybe hand an item or two off to a family member who can store them in case you want them back later-- just a suggestion. \n\nYour sister is WAY out of line. I'm so sorry you're going through all of this.", "NTA\n\nSo sorry for your loss. How can your sister be so insensitive to your loss? I will propbably go NC with her and carry on with life.", "NTA.

You don't need these AH making you feel bad about something so petty. I'm sorry but a wedding shower is pretty effing petty and trivial compared to the death of a child. Sounds to me like your sister is an unsympathetic AH and so is your family. They're toxic and uncaring. I think it's time you start thinking about cutting these people out of your life, since they find a bridal shower and gifts more important than the loss of your child. The very thought of asking for the gifts when you're mourning your child...I'm disgusted!", "NTA.

You have just lost a child, you are grieving and your sister is only thinking of herself...  Your sister and family behaviour is appalling in so many way... When she gets pregnant then she can get her own baby shower, with her own presents. I would keep some of the items with the baby's name though (e.g. blanket) (if you prefer ask those who gave it if it's OK),  because even if you didn't get to have him/her long, it was your child and those items mark his/her existence into your life.", "NTA. \n\nOh my dear, no.\n\nHoly shit balls, your sister (and possibly your family) are horrible people.\n\n1.

You are afraid of being judged???\n\nInfo: how *is* the rest of your family handling this?\n\nTime to circle to wagons and go NC.

You even made sure her bridal shower was being taken care of while you and your husband are processing your grief, and she has the audacity to ask you for your gifts and complain that you ruined her shower?

I am so sorry your family is awful.", "NTA, but your sister sure is.\n\n1. She planned her bridal shower for the same day as your baby shower, forcing you to give up the date you wanted even though you set that date first, and she knew it. That reeks of jealousy and a need to upstage you.\n\n2. You and your husband just had a severe and very recent loss, and your sister is.... Angry because you *lost your baby* and you're in need of some family TLC while you grieve?\n\n3. Your sister is mad because you're not putting her first, like you did with your baby/bridal shower date issue. I'm guessing this is a pattern where she's used to getting her way.\n\n4. Your family are being flying monkies, siding with her, while you're grieving the loss of your child, because she got them all up in arms about her slight lack of attention.\n\n5. This is the grossest one. Your sister has the *audacity* to say you should hand over whatever baby gifts you received that she wants, even with your child's name on them, regardless of how you feel.\n\nYeah, N T A OP, not at all. I sincerely hope you take the time and space that *you and your husband need* to grieve your loss.

But she still shouldn't have said a thing, because this is one of times that you can think something and never say out loud to absolutely anyone. She was purely a horrible human for the way she treated you, there's no excuse for that.
