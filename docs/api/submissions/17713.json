We have passes to a local amusement park and have been going twice a week since they opened.  My husband likes to try every ride in the amusement park at least once, and this year the park added two new rides. He has been looking forward to going on both of them for some time. One ride is in the general park, while the other is situated in the kids area. \nMy kids don\u2019t like fast rides.  The 6 year old just broke her wrist yesterday and is in an arm cast.  My other child just dislikes fast rides and gets anxiety leading up to going on them - so avoids them altogether lately.  \nToday, we got to the new ride in the kids area and adults must be accompanied by a child in order to ride.  My husband asked both girls if they would ride with him and they both declined.  The new ride is a smaller roller coaster and while it doesn\u2019t look to be super fast, it does have a few small hills and twists.  He was practically begging one of them to go with him but they both held their ground.  Now he is pissed.  He has called them selfish and has told them that if they don\u2019t want to do the things he wants to do, he will stop doing the things they like to do. He repeated it several times and was/is visibly pissed. My oldest was upset and stopped talking. My youngest was crying saying \u201chow can you expect someone with a broken wrist to go on fast rides?!\u201d  He took it personally and kept repeating how selfish they were, how he needs to correct their behaviour, etc.  I tried to hold my tongue until we got home but had to interject because he was becoming mean (we had gotten a pop and the six year old was thirsty - she asked for a sip and he said no, she could wait 20 minutes until we got home and could have water).   \nAt home he went upstairs and lay in bed with his back to the door.  The kids got ready for bed and the youngest asked where her dad was. I told her he must\u2019ve fallen asleep.  Usually he hugs and kisses them before bed.  The oldest didn\u2019t want hugs from him tonight.  \nFinally I heard him get up.  He came to their rooms and said goodnight and just started to walk away.  I made a comment about how ridiculous he was being and he just glared.  Then the youngest said to him that \u201ckids should choose if they want to go on rides or not\u201d and tonight they didn\u2019t want to go on that ride.  Then he went off again about how selfish they had acted and he was only asking for one simple request - but now that he didn\u2019t get what he wanted, he will not give them what they want.  I snapped and told him that the youngest JUST BROKE HER ARM and didn\u2019t want to go on a fast ride with a cast on, and the oldest doesn\u2019t like the anxiety felt before going on fast ride, and hates the feeling on the ride.  I said he is acting ridiculous and to grow tf up.  \nI know he will say something to me later about how I don\u2019t have his back - but to me this is ridiculous. should I have backed him up?", "created_utc": 1684544488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mdi0e/aita_for_defending_my_kids_against_their_dad/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only selfish person here is your partner.  He\u2019s behaving like a child.  Throwing a tantrum, threatening to not do things his kids like if they won\u2019t go on a damn ride?  Both of your kids had perfectly legitimate reasons to not want to go, and he kept pressuring them like he was at best a teenager.\n\nMy only question is this: why the hell did you wait so long to back your kids up?  You should have been shutting that mess down as soon as he started pressuring them.  They\u2019re way too young to let their father lean on them like that!", "You\u2019re husband is bullying your kids. No means no! You should feel proud your girls held their position of NO!

How can you even think that you're in the wrong here?\nGrowing up I would go on the wild rides with my mother. She and I loved it. Later I was the ride junkie with my youngest daughter, the wilder the ride the better for us. Then she started to have anxiety issues around 10yrs old and I lost my mini me for rides. You know what I did? I took her to the doctor first obviously, but at the parks I hugged her and went solo. I didn't bother with kids rides, I'm not a kid and their seats are to small\ud83d\ude09.\n\nYour husband is a bully. He verbally abused your kids. He's acting like a child because he couldn't go on a kids ride? And when he couldn't he berates you and your kids? Does that seem reasonable to you? Then he goes and sulks in his room like a child. Even children understand if they can't do everything on 1 visit and it sounds like you guys go multiple times so he can look forward to the next trip.....for a children roller-coaster \ud83d\udc76.

What he's doing is bullying and emotional abuse, you get that right?

I'm concerned he doesn't have protective instincts or selflessness in his body whatsoever.\n\nHis priorities are clearly focused on riding ALL the rides instead of on being a good father. He is so weak in patience, empathy, and compassion that if he doesn't shift his priorities in a healthy way asap, he will sooner or later lose the girls.

That's psychological abuse.", "Girl no you should not have backed him up and you have the patience of Job cause he would have gotten his a** handed to him at the amusement park.

A freshly broken bone is often painful.  Jiggling it around on a roller coaster can hurt, even in a cast.  Not to mention, you have to learn to manage your cast - the first day, the poor kid is probably knocking it into things (which can hurt) and adjusting to the weight of it.  Making them go on a ride that\u2019s going to throw a whole bunch of velocity changes at their awkward, heavy, and possibly painful arm is cruel.  If the kid wanted to go, that should be their choice as long as it\u2019s safe, but the kid doesn\u2019t want to.", "Editing to add judgement: NTA.", "She said no. She doesn't need a reason. he needs to accept the \"no\" even without a reason", "He absolutely does, but that doesn\u2019t mean the reason is invalid.", "I didn't say invalid. I said irrelevant.", "Literally not irrelevant.
