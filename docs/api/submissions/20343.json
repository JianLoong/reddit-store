{"id": 20343, "submission_id": "14g9pp7", "title": "AITA for \"parenting\" my SILs kid?", "selftext": "My SIL, my brother and their kids are/were staying with me temporarily. There's no issues at all outside of their youngest, 6m. He has anger issues, ADHD, ODD and is being evaluated for a slew of other things. Like bipolar, PTSD, and ASD (he started acting out after being bullied heavily at school). He can be quite the handful. My SIL gets touched out QUICK and she has expressed to me multiple times that she isn't stressed because of her kid and what he's doing, but stressed because she's tired of being looked at like a failure from the adults surrounding her (pretty sure she's talking about me and my husband). \n\nNow.. the way my SIL handles it is to ignore it. If he starts throwing a tantrum, she purposely ignores him. She says \"I ignore him because it makes him evaluate his emotions and he will come back and apologize once he's calmed down\". And as much as I hate to agree with her, that is how it plays out. He will act out, she will completely ignore him and he will come back after and apologize and be all better. But I can't stand it. Neither can my husband. I'm tired of this kid freaking out. I'm tired of this kid yelling or knocking things over to get attention.\n\nSo yesterday he starts going off and she immediately starts to ignore. I ended up stepping in and speaking to him. My SIL looks at me and says \"what do you think you're doing?\" And I tell her \"we are trying things my way today because I can't do this anymore. If it doesn't work, I will stop.\" I then go to the kid and pick him up. He fought it at first but then slowly just started crying instead of freaking out. After he calmed down, I put him down and he ran out of the house and hid. My SIL was panicked because we couldn't find him for a solid 30 minutes before he ran to his mom and again, apologized. So same end result really. She then looks at me and says \"you ever touch my fucking kid again and I will make sure your ass ends up in prison. You don't hold a kid down you fat fuck.\" And leaves. My brother is pissed at me and so is the rest of the family for \"traumatizing someone else's kid\" (they only heard one side). My brother has since come back to grab all their stuff. AITA?\n\nETA: her fat comment doesn't bother me. I am fat. I'm 380lbs on a good day. She said that I was suffocating him to strike fear. Given my size, that's probably what it looked like. She CLAIMS her son's therapist and evaluation team are the ones who told her to ignore him when he gets like that. I personally don't believe it.", "created_utc": 1687455641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g9pp7/aita_for_parenting_my_sils_kid/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't touch other people's kids, don't interfere with their parenting, ESPECIALLY if that kid has additional needs that should be dealt with in a certain way. Imagine if you were already upset and someone grabbed you out of nowhere and wouldn't let you move? \n\n'we're doing it my way today' is so sanctimonious and undermining and basically gross. If you wanted to do something like this, you talk to the mother beforehand to see if she's down. If not - don't do it. \n\n'same result really'.. Aside from the child disappeared for a period of time? Aside from the additional stress for the child? Aside from the terror a mother must feel when a child runs off like that? I'm not surprised she had more to say than she did - you would never be around my child ever again if you'd done that.", "YTA. Your SIL has been quite clear about what she does and why it works. They are working with professionals so it\u2019s quite likely she\u2019s following their exact guidance. But nooo, you decided that your random ideas must be better and made the situation way worse and actively dangerous for the child.\n\nIf you can\u2019t handle having her kid around you can ask her to leave. What you did was horrible and completely inappropriate, and from what she says bordering on violent.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is implementing the processes given to her by her kid's therapist and evaluation team. You held down a kid who has already been traumatized by bullying, has diagnosed issues, and then RAN AWAY at 6 years old so that you couldn't find him for 30 minutes.\n\nReally, I'm shocked your SIL didn't call the police when her 6yo ran out of the house and was missing for 30 minutes.  I would have.\n\nI N F O: where did your SIL get her method of handling her son from? A therapist or some sort of program associated with his diagnosis?\n\nYour SIL's methodology sounds extremely similar to what was taught to me when dealing with a high-emotions 6yo with similar issues.", "A 400 lb holding down a tiny 6 year old, yeah I can see how horrifying this would be for the child that he hid himself out of fear......yta", "YTA. You're not looking out for you SILs kid; you're annoyed with his behaviour. This is a **you** problem. You also didn't receive consent from your SIL to try your tactic, you just imposed your will, which makes you doubly TA.", "YTA\n\nYou obviously have no idea about the psychology behind this approach.  \n\nEveryone, EVERYONE, has a reaction to stress, frustration, anxiety, fear ect.  Generally they lead to a fight or flight response.  Flight responses would be going to a different room, curling in a ball and crying, listening to music or watching tv.  But in a fight response, they will lash out at others and break things. \n\nIf you yell or try to discipline a child that is already in a fight mode because they can't cope with what is going on around them, you will make that reaction worse because you are causing more stress, frustration, anxiety, and fear.  But if you ignore them, they can relax, calm down and shed those stressors.  The fact that he is apologizing shows once he is calm he recognizes his errors.  It is by far the best way to deal with the situation.  \n\nYou should not have gotten involved in something you know nothing about.  If you don't like her parenting choices you are free to ask her to leave your house but interfering has only made things more difficult.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, you can't parent ODD the way you would parent a typical kid. There's a lot of research on this.\n\nSecond, you cannot restrain a child, particularly one that's not yours. ~~That borders on abuse, and, in fact, may be considered abuse by your local social services organization.~~  Just read that you're 380 pounds  - a 380 pound adult vs. a 6-yo child. THAT is abuse! Your SIL is right.\n\nThird, HE'S NOT YOUR KID. You have no right to discipline him.", "Info: why are/were they living with you? As a favor to them/you or were they your guests?\n\nRegardless of that, you're an AH. The info will just let me decide the range of YTA.\n\nThe kid's mom told you specifically that his therapists advised her to ignore him during his episode and that works. Not only does it work, but it's the *right* way of dealing with a child who has the specific mental health issues like he does.\n\nNot only did you ignore that completely, but also basically TRAUMATIZED a 6yo. \n\nYou picked him up, basically telling him that he will have minimal bodily autonomy unless he calms down. That's majorly messed up. Poor kid, can't imagine how stifled he must've felt \n\nYTA. A major one.", "INFO how long were you holding him for? Why did you start holding him at all when you started off saying you were going to talk to him? Were you holding him tightly, and was he trying to get away/want to be put down?", "YTA. \ud83d\udcaf if you can\u2019t hold a kid down against his will. there were other ways to handle it like leaving the room or telling your sister she\u2019d need to find somewhere else to live. You can\u2019t hold a kid down. You probably scared him to death if he has trauma from past issues or abuse. Your sister is dealing with it the way she knows will work either because she\u2019s done research or talked to his doctors or because she\u2019s his mother. You already said that she felt judged by you. There\u2019s nothing worse than feeling judged by other parents or people. Kids don\u2019t come with manuals. If it was me I would have pried you off my kid. What if he had ran out and gotten hit by a car or was never found. Your poor sister. You owe her a deep sincere apology.", "If I was your sister-in-law, I\u2019d hit you in the side of the head with a pattern because my first instinct is to fight but since you said you\u2019re 380 I have to have an advantage and there\u2019s no way I can beat anybody\u2019s ass that\u2019s 380", "YTA you're a fucking adult, they're a kid, you probably did fucking traumatize him into silence.", "YTA so your sister in-law is going with the advice of the professional i'll repeat, a professional who has trained for these type of situations and clients has given your sister in- law a strategy which she is sticking too, it is working and you 'don't agree with it' and ignore that advice despite you not having any right too nor have any training, preceded to restrain the child (restraints are arguably a last ditch effort and nearly every good trained professional says that) and eventually he just gave up because of course you overpowered him your an adult, and that was apparently 'dealing with it' in your very much non-trained eyes also i'm laughing at 'personally i don't believe it' who cares if you believe it or not", "YTA This is coming from a SPED teacher that is certified in CPI restraint.  You did an unsafe and dangerous restraint that could seriously injure the child especially considering your size. Numerous children have DIED because of improper restraint done by untrained individuals like yourself. \n\nPlus, he went and hid, so it did not work. As soon as you released him, he engaged in hiding behavior which means YOU terrified him. Congratulations on breaking any trust he had in you.", "YTA, it is understandable that you are frustrated with the behavior, however the mature thing to do would be to sit down with your SIL and brother and talk to about it, not jump in the middle of an already escalated situation. If your nephew is being evaluated for numerous conditions, it sounds like his parents are being advised by professionals on how to handle his behavior. If it is negatively affecting your household you are within your rights to ask them to find other accommodations, but you are not within your rights to physically restrain him. It sounds like your way caused way more issues. It\u2019s not your call how to parent him, your only recourse is to tel him it isn\u2019t working for you and ask them to leave.", "If her son has ODD it is likely that his therapist and team has told her to ignore it. I\u2019m a teacher, have taught kids with ODD and been to multiple sessions about it and it is the number one thing I\u2019ve been told to do", "So you restrained him? YTA. Don\u2019t restrain someone else\u2019s child, especially when you have no training on how to do it safely. The kid ran and hid most likely because he\u2019s terrified of you now. He probably won\u2019t feel safe again around you and your SIL has every right to be pissed. She may never trust you being around her child again. Don\u2019t touch other people\u2019s kids, and especially don\u2019t restrain them. Improper physical restraints can lead to injury or death. That child probably has already had to deal with a lot considering the diagnoses, and he\u2019s only 6 ffs! You are not his therapist or doctor, you are not his parent, you do not know what his treatment plan is, just leave the child the hell alone, you seem to consider him more of a nuisance than actually seeing him as a human being.", "Yta. Let his therapist \"train\" him.", "YTA. Your SIL\u2019s method appears to be working. The fact that the method annoys YOU has no relevance at all. She is the parent you are not. And that\u2019s pretty much the end of your relationship with your brother and his children. And as a general observation, in my opinion, it\u2019s never a good idea to raise your kids in another adult\u2019s house. It always leads to conflict.

If you don't put wood on a fire, it will stop burning. But what seals it for me is that you said if someone did that to your daughter, you would lose your shit.  You were not trying to help.  You were annoyed and determined to teach him a lesson you would never be allowed to be taught to your own kid.", "YTA.  You said that her approach works and yet you still stepped in.  And your approach was physical.  I get that you didn't physically hurt him but you don't touch a child at all without their parent's permission.

They need to understand that this doesn't always work, especially in circumstances like living in someone else's home.\n\nYou, on the other hand, suck for not confronting them before implementing your parenting strategy. You say there are no issues apart from your nephew, but you don't say anything about discussing his behavior, laying down ground rules and consequences. In that respect you crossed a line, even though it's your house. \n\nEvery adult in this situation needs to learn how to communicate calmly and effectively. All of you get an F for this subject.", "[deleted]", "NTA....this is causing YOU STRESS in your HOME!!! I understand the kid has a lot of issues, but damn how much can a person take?

Your SIL's response was completely out of line. It sounds like you were trying to help in a situation you knew was difficult for your SIL, and she responded with threats and insults. That's not okay. You were in a tough position\u2014having to watch your SIL struggle to deal with her child's difficult behaviors and feeling called upon to help\u2014but your reaction was strictly out of concern for the child.

That being said, you should have maybe tried to talk to her first about an alternative way to deal with him. Every parent does things differently and it really wasn\u2019t your place to step in. BUT, it is your house and you are letting them stay with you. I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with tantrums every day either and you have every right to make the rules in your own home.

I don't think ignoring the kid is great, maybe the mom could have directed him to a corner and then ignore him so at least he's in a safe place and not being destructive. But since you did your thing I don't think they are gonna trust you. Sounds like a sucky situation, just be glad they're out of your house.", "YTA, so where's your degree in parenting or psychology?", "Yta. If someone touched my kid, it\u2019d be a different post on legal advice. The audacity to take action. I\u2019d slap the shit outta you lol", "YTA,\nAnd a bully. Hope that your nephew recovers from your sections, and it honestly sounds like you're very judgemental. \nYou're not going to the appointments for her sin, SHE IS, you need to back the hell up and rethink your own actions.", "Congratulations on becoming a talking point at therapy for years to come!", "YTA, and you\u2019re lucky if your SIL doesn\u2019t have you charged with assault and endangerment.", "She\u2019s right. YTA. I\u2019ve worked with special needs kids and you don\u2019t want to give them attention during meltdowns as it reinforces their behavior. Waiting it out is the best option as he isn\u2019t hurting himself or others.", "As someone who works in special education, I cannot even begin to describe how wrong this was. You retraumatized that child, against his mother's wishes. You should be ashamed of yourself. And you claim to have professional training? Thank god you don't work in the field. Never touch her child again. People like you are why we have such a hard time getting parents to trust and work with us. \n\nYTA, btw. I cannot believe you needed to be told that when you physically held down a child.

How bout it Reddit?\u201d", "Op, I have ODD, ADHD, Autism, BPD, Bipolar and many other things. While you're way may work as he gets older(this is what my mom and bf do now if I have a meltdown/episode) it is not a good idea to do that to a child. It may cause him to not only fear you but fear touch and with children with these problems it is best to ignore it as it will make them deal with themselves. YTA, and really need to look back on your actions and their future consequences", "What you personally don\u2019t believe doesn\u2019t matter. Ignoring the behavior is a common behavioral therapy tactic.", "Bottom line, it\u2019s not your kid. Don\u2019t touch another woman\u2019s kid, I don\u2019t care who you are. You have a problem with her kid, take it up with her. It\u2019s not to your liking? Well then either suck it up or they need to find another place to stay. There is never an excuse to put your hands on someone else\u2019s child.\n\nYour parenting style just seems like you think you know better than everyone else, including mental health professionals, even though what they\u2019re doing is clearly working as you admitted. Same parenting style I see from every shitty parent ever. \n\nYes, there are kids that are more complicated than others. It\u2019s idiotic to think there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to children, especially when it\u2019s not even your kid and you think you know him better than his own mother.", "YTA. You and my sister in law would be great friends. Her issue is that I don\u2019t feed my 3 & 5 year old ice cream late at night. Oh I also don\u2019t give them soda. She feels bad for my kids that they have a mom like me. \n\nHere\u2019s a tip, mind your business. Not your kid. I love that you think you know best based on nothing. You don\u2019t see the kid all day everyday like they do. You don\u2019t take him to his appointments and talk to his doctors. Back off.", "YTA. You know their issues before you took them in. You shouldn\u2019t have taken them in if you can\u2019t take the sons outburst. You should have respected your sil parenting since she has consulted doctors and will be the one dealing with it for life. You\u2019re just a spectator and will not be involved in his sons life growing up. Your sister is right that it\u2019s exhausting to be surrounded by people who judge their parenting skills and yes,  youre one of these people judging her. Sadly you weren\u2019t really concerned about your nephew . you\u2019re more concerned about the noise he is making which you find irritating and you want it to stop. Im sure you mean well.  It\u2019s really not your place.", "They need to leave. They are going to damage your marriage by setting you against each other. Those episodes don\u2019t go away. \nOnly thing you can do right now is leave the room till it\u2019s over. If it\u2019s during dinner, take your plate and leave the room.

It's like making your skin crawl, head explode, and you feel like you're suffocating. Especially hugging when you're not ready for it. And even that is not a good explanation of it. \n\nYou're one of those people who think they know better when they truly know nothing at all.\n\nBut hey, you got the kid out of your house, that's what you wanted, right? Doesn't matter what damage you've done emotionally and psychologically to him. You got your way.", "YTA. Ignoring tantrums has been the tried and true method for dealing with them . Also he's not your child so you have no business trying to discipline him. You have now traumatized and more than likely the trauma will affect him for years to come .", "Omg YES.  You are a TOTAL ASSHOLE.  YTA all the way.", "I'm afraid that things wouldn't have ended so kindly had I been the mother in this situation. Where do you get the audacity to grab a child that isn't yours. That sounds criminal. You should be ashamed that you even thought that was appropriate.", "I am appalled by what she told your family, she's TA for that, hands down.\n\nI think you should've discussed with her ahead of time that the tantrums were causing you distress as well, and discussed different options for how to handle said episodes in your home BEFORE trying to take over like that. You're TA, but I'm my opinion JUST BARELY. \n\nListening to ANY child scream for any length of time triggers anger/frustration IN EVERY ADULT I HAVE EVER KNOWN. Her disregarding that because her child is diagnosed with alphabet soup is her fault. Even with neurodivergent children there are better ways of dealing with problems than just ignoring the child. She needs to be working on coping skills to prevent the tantrums, not just dealing with them as they happen. Minimizing triggers, sensory deprivation accessories, stimulating toys, a space to be loud when needed, a communication board to point out problems when verbalizing feelings or problems is hard, and skills to help calm down would all be better uses of her time than IGNORING HER SCREAMING CHILD. You may be TA for taking over parenting a kid that isn't yours, but she's equally TA for not learning how to properly parent her own kid. At 6 tantrums should not be so frequent, or last so long, that you have to feel the need to take over.", "What the mother does, doesn't work. Even a neurodivergent 6 year old should not be having tantrums at such a frequency, to such lengths, for enough time to make someone else feel the need to step in and parent their child. It could very well be possible the child is seeing professionals who are telling mom how to work on the problems and mom is just 100% done and doesn't care anymore. Now, I agree OP is TA for parenting another person's child, but SIL should also be TA here for not knowing how to take care of her own child.", "Amen", "you can't delete other peoples comments on reddit jsyk", "What she should do is file assault charges.", "I appreciate your measured approach. However, it sounds like the behavior plan was shared with her. She just \u201cdidn\u2019t believe it (that the therapists would say to ignore it)\u201d", "I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re not the arse for wanting peace. But you can\u2019t step in. Just step away.", "Don't even get me started on how limited the brain capabilities of a \"normal\" 6 year old are on emotional regulation. Emotional regulation isn't an inherent skill we are born with, it's learned from what we are taught.

You are not qualified to have an opinion.", "It doesn't matter if you agree with his treatment plan or not, you do not EVER touch someone else's child unless they ask you to.  You're lucky she's not pressing assault charges against you.", "I really hope they file assault charges against you.", "YTA\n\nWe were kinder to dogs and cats who wanted to actually BITE and/or scratch us at our clinic than you were to your damn nephew.  Restraint is so very easy to do wrong, especially when there is that significant weight difference, and it's not the answer for fear behavior.  Did you even give a passing thought to protecting his airway?  Keep an eye on his color to make sure he was breathing appropriately while you restrained him and he panicked?  \n\nI'm neurodivergent as well, and being restrained would definitely get me into the fight or flight mindset in a major way.  Touch sensitivity is not uncommon with us, which makes what you did even worse.  You're lucky that once you relaxed your grip he was more interested in flight than popping you one.", "I don't know much about ODD, but if this kid is getting evaluated for PTSD, I'm guessing the bullying was very severe, and it seems likely to me that there could have been some physical aspect to it, so I can just imagine a kid who struggles with that being triggered into a panic attack from what OP did.", "Yes you are right, OP should have told them get out the moment kid starts having a breakdown and parents decide to ignore it. I'm just glad OP brother had the good sense to leave, go make somebody else miserable by ignoring your child.", "I have been care taker in a mental hospital for 8 years, and it was the 'pro' approach everyone at all levels was told to use especially with kids with autism when they had a tantrums/meltdowns.  \nIt's very important to work as a team in this kind of case, and people like OP (a total amateur), who decide to totally improvise without consultation with the rest of the team, destroy all the work that was done.", "Look into Nurtured Heart and keep your hands off of kids. Yes his team told her that.", "Oh but she said same end result really so no harm no foul right? /s (I\u2019m so mad at this woman I could scream)", "When and at what time did the mother go looking? I have 7 year old autistic nephew. Whether I, you or YouTube pissed him off he's not running out that house without an adult behind him. She saw her son ran out the house, saw him running for the front door and not immediately run behind him? Lol just cray cray.", "Exactly, thank you for writing this. As a teenager I was in a residential home for troubled adolescent boys and restraint was one of the methods used. However it often wasn't carried out correctly and sometimes the staff even had patients restrain each other, which led to some (thankfully minor while I was there) physical injuries, but I know some people that I'm still in contact with from the facilty developed trauma and stuff from being improperly held. Restraint isn't something to mess around with and the fact that OP is doing it untrained to a small child is unbelievably fucked up.", "Borderline? Nah that's just straight up assault.", "I have a 5 year old with ASD. I would be right behind him and it was inferred that this mother was too. And as the caregiver for my son, I know how fast he is and if he wants to hide, it can take awhile. I am unsure what your relationship with your nephew is or how often you have taken care of him or any other child but children are quick and good at hiding.

It's really shitty and I'm not saying sometimes it isn't the only option (because it sure can feel like it), but in this situation especially, it shouldn't have even been considered.\n\nRestraining a person, especially a small child, is just not something someone should do, but especially if they have no idea what they are doing.", "That\u2019s cool, I did too. In fact I also did a BA in psychology, I\u2019m still not a psychologist though and wouldn\u2019t be qualified to say whether or not this is or should be part of a child\u2019s treatment plan for the diagnoses this particular child has or is suspected to have.
