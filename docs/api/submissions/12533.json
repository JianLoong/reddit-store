{"id": 12533, "submission_id": "11tyw6l", "title": "AITA for telling my son I don\u2019t care how he or his girlfriend feels, she was insensitive and downright rude and she\u2019s banned from my house?", "selftext": "I\u2019m dad to Helen who is 30 and Andrew who is 20. For context: I\u2019m 50. They both have the same mother, but she and I are divorced. Both my kids have basically lived with me full time since the divorce around 15 years ago as my ex moved abroad. \n\nAnyway, Helen is autistic. She wasn\u2019t diagnosed until she was 20 and is what I think she calls high functioning? Basically, she describes it as not hindering her life in any way regarding working and living independently, but she is more emotionally sensitive about some things than others, can be repetitive sometimes, sometimes struggles a bit in social settings and she has described herself as perhaps coming across as socially awkward. Helen is very vocal about being autistic and gets frustrated when people have stereotypes about how autistic people should look or act. She says it irritates her that she describes herself as \u2018normal looking\u2019 and people assume that you can\u2019t be normal or have an ordinary job if you\u2019re autistic. She went to university, got a bachelors and a masters and got a decent job and has her own house just like anyone her age. \n\nAndrew knows this. I know this obviously. I\u2019m very proud of Helen of course and of my son as he is currently in university pursuing the degree he\u2019s always wanted and is very proactive about his future but I\u2019m disgusted with what his girlfriend said about Helen. Basically, he\u2019s been dating Megan for 3 months and he introduced her to me and Helen at a dinner. She asked Helen about herself and kept saying stuff like \u2018wow that\u2019s pretty good for an autistic person.\u2019 It went from what could have been genuine misunderstanding to pure ignorance and sarcasm. She kept being rude, dismissive and actually spoke down to Helen in a baby voice. I asked her politely to leave as it was disgusting and upset both me and Helen. \n\nI\u2019ve told my son that I don\u2019t want his girlfriend in my house. He said it\u2019s unfair and that I need to \u2018chill.\u2019 He kept pushing and pushing and I said that I don\u2019t care how he feels or how Megan feels she\u2019s banned from my house. I even had to pull the \u2018it\u2019s my name on the mortgage card\u2019 and he\u2019s since gone crying to his mother and is staying with his maternal grandmother who is harassing me. She\u2019s acting like I\u2019ve kicked him out but I haven\u2019t. My ex-wife has told me to get over myself and that not everybody is gonna understand what it\u2019s like being autistic.\n\nI also need to point out that Andrew has told me Megan feels she has nothing to be sorry for and is calling me an \u2018old, insensitive bastard.\u2019 It appears my son feels the same.\n\nI\u2019m getting flack left right and centre accusing me of playing favourites when I\u2019m not. I just think my daughter deserves basic respect. Helen says Megan was rude and disrespectful so why should I let someone like that in my house. AITA?\n\nETA: Megan acted like Helen was a baby, an idiot basically and was mocking her. I thought at first she didn\u2019t understand but she was genuinely being rude and mocking her. Helen does not have limited understanding or a reduced mental capacity like some people may have so it was entirely inappropriate and downright offensive.\n\nAlso, Helen doesn\u2019t live with me. She has her own house which I did mention, I apologise for not making that clearer. She came over for dinner so she could meet Megan for the first time like I did. It was at my house and Helen came over after work on the night in question. I actually spent hours making a meal and dinner from scratch as I was excited to meet my sons new girlfriend and it was all wasted.\n\nAnd yes, Helen was greatly offended and upset. It upset her so much she was crying. I actually have had to comfort her and I\u2019m still doing so as she is feeling absolutely horribly depressed about it.\n\nYes, Helen and I tried to educate Megan hence why we thought it was maybe misunderstanding. She ignored it completely and went into a full offensive. And no, I don\u2019t get her motivations either. I didn\u2019t raise my son to tolerate people like this, hence why I\u2019m disgusted in him too.\n\nI also like to think I was a pretty good dad when they were kids. I always provided for them. I was always there. They were always first. They were treated equally. I helped them transition with their mum living abroad. I paid for their mum to come over and visit and let her stay in the house. I paid for them to visit her. I was incredibly fair and understanding I think. I\u2019ve always loved them both equally.\n\nAnd no, my son has never displayed any signs of being abusive or narcissistic before. He has always gotten along with his sister so I don\u2019t know where this is coming from.", "created_utc": 1679076638, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tyw6l/aita_for_telling_my_son_i_dont_care_how_he_or_his/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
