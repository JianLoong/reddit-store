However, my mom and my wife (36F - Aria) just do not get along. They're entirely different people. But they usually respect each other enough not to cause problems about it.\n\nFor the context: Aria and I have two daughters. I gave birth to our with our second child when covid began. Aria is a critical care doctor (basically, she works in the ICU). She was supposed to stay home for a while and help me out but the pandemic stuck and since her line of work was heavily needed, she went back to work.\n\nDuring the pandemic, especially the beginning, she was almost never home because she was scared she would transmit the virus to me or our kids. Even when she did come home, she kept her distance. We had to spend a lot of time apart but we talked constantly and she helped me through those days. She spends a lot of time with us now and I'm happy we're past those scary times.\n\nI invited my family over to our house for an early Christmas this year (we can't really travel around the holidays with our kids and Aria's schedule). My mother kept hitting me with comments indicating Aria abondoned me when I needed her the most. I'll give you examples:\n\n- How can she even make up for the lost time with kids? She was barely around at all.\n- You're practically a single parent at this point\n- You really have gone through so much. Not many women could handle being left alone with two kids like that. Most people would even get a divorce over something like this.\n-You're being too alturistic and sacrificing yourself for someone who doesn't deserve it.\n\nI told my mother to stop these comments a few times. She did not. So I snapped. I told her she had no idea what she was talking about. That I knew from marrying Aria came with these challenges and I am fine with it. And I told her if she kept making these comments about one of her hostesses, she would have to leave.\n\nMy mother called me an AH and said she was just looking out for me and doing what mother are supposes to do.
