I did the conversion for that, and it's $2768 USD...per month. That's a lot for just spending money, especially considering how low Thailand's cost of living is.", "That's over $2700 USD which is a lot of fun money even in my high COL area. Totally reasonable to cap it and perhaps a job would suit her well. Seems like she has too much time on her hands and is looking for more money to spend to fill it. \n\nShe'll keep moving those goal posts if you let her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  I looked it up and you are giving her more in allowance per month than the average Thai ANNUAL salary.  Sounds like you don't have kids since you used SAHW, not SAHM, so aside from disability, there is nothing preventing her from getting a job.", "Do you know how much a Gucci bag costs? How can you expect her to impress her friends on so little? /s\n\nNTA.  Sit her down and ask her what is she spending her money on that this is not enough.  That is a lot of money even in the US, to have just for fun money.", "NTA.  Tell her to get a job or she gets no spending money.  Do you have kids? Is she disabled? Why isn't she working?", "INFO: What is she spending so much money on?! Sounds like you\u2019re giving her roughly $2700 American dollars per month (translated from THB), which is more than I make in my full-time job as a copywriter. It sounds like she\u2019s blowing tons of cash each month.", "NTA and I would drop her spending money down to 50K THB for having the audacity to complain. Time to get a job, sweetheart!", "NTA what\u2019s she buying in Thailand that she needs almost $3000 in US dollars?", "NTA, if she is just a SAHW and not a SAHM with kids involved there is absolutely no reason why she can\u2019t work to earn more spending money. You are already so much nicer than me, lol. Unless there was a reason for my SO to stay at home I would never give them that much money to do nothing, and if they complained it would be the end of that.", "NTA.  Well handled OP.  I\u2019m proud of you.", "She gets more than double my own spending money after taxes and rent and still complains, what?", "Well, I\u2019m assuming you knew she was materialistic when you married her, right? Or is this some sudden change in personality? \n\nIf the former, this is what you signed on for. \n\nIf the latter, then you need to have a serious conversation about what has changed/if it\u2019s medical and how you want to live going forward.", "Not enough info it Depends\u2026.. if 100k thb more is literally nothing to you then she might have a point. \n\nBut in general its a lot more money for disposable spending than most have.", "INFO\n\nAre there small children at home all day?", "I don\u2019t even understand why she has spending money. She\u2019s your wife, not a child with an allowance.\nI\u2019ve been a sahw for a year and now I\u2019m sort of part time sahw and would I fuck have an allowance.\nInstead I just use my brain and spend what is reasonable or needed and fits in our budgets.", "You give allowance to your wife?!?", "INFO: How much fun money/allowance do you spend for yourself every month? (Or do you just buy things whenever you want it?)\n2700$ is a lot. But if you spend 10k$ every month on your hobbies then i understand her better. I am a strong believer that the money for fun in a mariage should be equal. You can argument about if she should work or not, but that should be another discussion in my opinion.\n\n/edit: by the way, i have 200$ allowance :D", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I live on less than that now.\n\nNTA", "Totally this!", "Or she can get a job, like you said she already gets above the normal average for their area.", "Its about what i get paid for 8 hours of work", "Read the comment about the actual definition of an allowance. She also gets $2800 USD a month in Thailand, a baller ass apartment\u2019s monthly rent in that country is a quarter of that. So he\u2019s giving her a lot of money to spend no questions asked post all actual living expenses.", "Normally, I\u2019d be kinda weirded out by this, too, but it does seem like he\u2019s paying all the bills and gives her tons of spending money, more than I make in my full-time job. And she doesn\u2019t even have to work.", "Websters Dictionary: Allowance- \u00a0a sum regularly provided for personal or household expenses\n\nI think it fits. She's not a child, but she is a dependent. The money is not used for living expenses, it's personal spending money with no budget attached.", "I give an allowance to my GF. She doesn't work, I pay all the bills, she gets an allowance to spend however she wants. What's wrong with that? It keeps her from having to ask me for things and gives her more independence, plus is easier to budget for than just paying for whatever she wants.", "Its relative to their earnings\u2026.. \n\nif OP makes $2.7k USD per day of work then this is well within their budget.", "Then ofc YTA \u2026.. if you make 100k thb per day of work then 200k thb for a month of your wifes spending shouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "Calling it an allowance is the weird part to me. My ex sahw didn't want to work and I had money to support that, but she felt insecure about not having any money accessible to her. Since financial abuse is a thing obviously. So I gave her X amount and she could do whatever with it. I didn't call it an allowance though. Just financial security for my partner as an individual not just the financial security of the partnership", "I think it\u2019s because in western culture people associate it with kids. In other countries they probably see it as the actual definition.", "Not if she is spending it recklessly , gold digger comes to mind. Maybe he wants to save for retirement or future kids. We don\u2019t have all that information.", "Since OP appears to be giving her Thai money, I\u2019m wondering if maybe the word allowance is just a language barrier thing, idk.", "Even if you didn't call it an allowance, that's what it was though? There's a specific term for giving a family member a sum of money for their own use every month or week, that term is an allowance.", "I guess you don\u2019t understand relative to earnings \u2026. \n\nEveryone spends some money on frivolous things they just have different incomes.\n\nA good example would be if mark Zuckerberg complained that his wife spending 500k was too much on shopping when in reality this is loose change to him and less than what he makes in a day.", "It's just a word.  Aita threads always read way too much into things.  Everyone acts like dawn linguistic detectives.  My mom and dad both budgeted fun money and they called it their allowance.  No one e was a abused."]}
