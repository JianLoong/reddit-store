In that time, she has started to go through menopause. I understand about the changes that she is going through, but it seems that she is being eviler and more uncaring than I was led to understand about this change. So yesterday she yelled at me about not being able to find a washcloth. I was finishing an email for work when she yelled to my office about not finding a washcloth. After yelling back and forth about a minute, I I told her that the spares were in the guest bathroom, since that is the largest storage closet, we have in the house. She got angrier and said she looked already. Now, I was getting pissed so I went to the closet and got her the washcloth.\n\nJump too today. I went to the garage to work on a backpack I am using for ruck training. As I was walking back in the house, I noticed that my favorite pair (and nearly daily wear) hiking boots were covered in mud. I mean the only part of the boots that were not caked in dried on mud were the top of the ankle supports. It's as if they were dunked in mud. I knew I had not done that because the last I wore them was when I went to the office two days ago. So, I walked in the house and asked my wife if she knew how my boots were covered in mud and she said, \"Oh yeah, I wanted to work in the backyard, your boots were there so I put them on, it's no big deal.\" I told her they were caked with dried mud, and she said, \"well I'll get around to cleaning them sometime.\" At that point I lost it. I said \"I recognize that you are going through changes, that was really fuXXed up. The least you could have done was told me but to just throw in the garage and be like, oh well, that's foul as hell.\" She mumbled sorry and then went back to watching TV.\n\nAITA for yelling at her about the boots?", "created_utc": 1678839551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rfrfv/aita_for_yelling_at_my_wife_about_boots/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The action that I took was yelling at my wife about using (without asking) a pair of boots and then damaging the boots and not telling me\n2. The action might me a asshole because I forgot that she was going through menopause and that her hormones are changing.

But regarding your wife:  I feel for her.  That was me several years ago.  I wasn't nice to my husband or anyone else.  Anything would set me off.  And I mean ANYTHING.  I also had horrendous hot flashes.  I eventually saw my doctor about it and thankfully she had a lot of great suggestions on ways to treat it.  Please encourage your wife to talk to her provider.  I eventually had to be on a hormone replacement therapy which I took for many years.  There are other medications that can also help as well as supplements.  Every person is different so if one thing doesn't work, she needs to try something else.  The only real AH statement you made was saying that you understand about the changes.  I'm sorry, but you don't.  The only person who can truly understand is the one experiencing them.  I hope your wife can find the help she needs.  It made the world of difference for me.  I hope it does for her.", "INFO: But isn't it easier to clean the mud off boots after it has dried? \n\nI'm not sure why you blame her inconsideration on menopause; why not just call it what it is and talk about it with her?", "Without knowing more about your relationship in general, I'm going with ESH. You and your wife need to learn to communicate without getting into a screaming match. She may be going through some stuff, but that's not an excuse for yelling at you. And you don't even have a bunch of extra hormones running through your system. Calm the f down, both of you.", "ESH. Dude. It's mud on boots. Those are easy to clean up and she obviously needs to go on some medication to help ease the symptoms but you yelling at her over dirty boots is petty", "NTA, if she had any plans of cleaning them they would\u2019ve been clean by the time you went to use them.", "YTA.  YOU decided to engage in a shouting match over washcloths.  YOU decided to be confrontational over boots.  BOOTS. And to boot, you blamed a social fauxpas on her lifes change.   Why not try to be a better person and understand the utterly incredible life changing event taking place within your wife's body and shut your mouth for a change.", "NAH - she has KTHS. \n\nThat stands for \"Kill The Husband Syndrome\". Anyone who has been through menopause knows exactly what I mean.\n\nLittle things about you that never annoyed her are now reasons for her new attitude. It sucks, but if you can hang in there, it will get better.\n\nFrom someone who's been there.", ">In that time, she has started to go through menopause. I understand about the changes that she is going through, but it seems that she is being eviler and more uncaring than I was led to understand about this change.\n\nYTA for this alone.
