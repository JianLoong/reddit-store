This came after I spent serious time and effort and money on everyone else and they apparently all assumed that someone else had gotten something for me so none of them did. What the hell was that toothbrush about anyway??? I cooked dinner every night for my sons and I have very good dental hygiene, it couldn't have been a hint--20 years later I STILL get confused and upset when I think about it.\n\nSo yeah, OP, fuck that noise.

Surely your husband at least does the clean up afterwards?\n\nSo no, NTA for saying \"enough\". Sit down with your kids and find out what traditions they like best. Then do those, but share the workload.\n\nBut spitefully taking down your stocking is kinda... childish. Leave it up and be graceful about whatever ends up in there on Christmas morning.

(I got special large Christmasy fabric bags).   (2) limit gifts - something they want, something they need, something to wear, something to share, something to treasure (yearly ornament).  The fun ones are from Santa, with the \u201cneeds\u201d from mom and dad.  (3) engage the other adults - after one too many times explaining why the elves didn\u2019t move when I was too tired to remember- traffic to the North Pole, etc, my husband has taken that on.   Just straight up ask him to take on certain tasks.  (4)  My kids are just a few years older than yours and pull out the decorations themselves and go to town.  Is the house fully decorated?  No.  Are the lights above the garage?  No.  But we will still be merry, and my mental health will be better to celebrate with them!  So if taking down the stocking makes it better for you, do it!

The adults are trying to avoid feeling the guilt they are feeling for damn good reason by asking you to put it back up. Do what you will. You're an adult who knows your mind. If they rescue the stocking and fill it with stuff on their own, let them. You deserve that plus a week at a spa resort with all the bells and whistles while they take care of the kids and deep clean the house for you. Otherwise, leave it in the box in the garage (or wherever that gets stored the rest of the year).", "NTA. It literally made barely any difference to them if your stocking is there or not. If they\u2019re not going out of their way to put something thoughtful in it then what\u2019s the issue of you taking it down?\nI think they\u2019re projecting on the issue. The removal of the stocking is a literal representation of their thoughtlessness and they don\u2019t like being called out.", "I wish I could banish the whole stocking thing altogether.", "NTA\n\nI feel greatly for you. This has always been my mother. Her stocking has always been empty come Christmas morning. My dad never put anything in it at all. It wasn't until a year or so ago I realized how much that must suck and started to fill it with the help of my younger siblings. Im proud of you for standing up for yourself, I wish my mom wouldve done that instead of just being sad in silence.", "NTA - It really is tiring doing it all yourself. I don't have kids, it's just myself and my husband, and I still get tired. I eventually stopped mailing out Christmas cards. A few years ago, I stopped putting up outdoor decorations. This year, I've only baked one thing so far. At least my husband and I do fill stockings for each other with thoughtful things and get each other presents. If your family wants your stocking back up, they should actually put in some effort.", "My father must be the most thoughtful husband in the entire world. He always gave my mother a beautiful piece of jewelry for Christmas as well as things she would never buy for herself. I\u2019m going to go have a good cry because this our first Christmas without my mother. Oh yeah and I\u2019m single because nobody could ever compete with my father for husband of the century. \n\nMen \u2026. Do better. (NTA)", "NTA. If they want, they can locate your stocking, hang it up on xmas eve, and make your day a little more magical. The kids are too young to know any different. As long as they see mama smiling and enjoying their excitement, they will be happy. \nI hope you get a chance to enjoy the magic you create for everyone else.", "INFO: when you say your family is fighting you on taking down your stocking and not asking for anything, who do you mean? Your extended family? Husband? Does this include the kids?\n\nN T A for feeling frustrated and unappreciated that you\u2019ve been left doing the brunt of the work. And also N T A for not wanting to go all out.\n\nBut I feel like the real issue is that you\u2019re using taking down the stocking to indirectly communicate your frustration at your family. Nobody wins with that. You need to tell your family to get their shit together and contribute if they want a more elaborate Christmas.\n\nTbh, you sound like my mother. She was and is COMPLETELY justified for being mad at my dad for not pulling his weight, but also it sucked as a kid. Not the lack of going wild for holidays, but because of the passive tension.\n\nYour kids don\u2019t need an elf on the shelf, but if you resent the holidays they WILL pick that up as they get older.", "All your family would need to do would be to put in some good effort to appreciate you. That's it.\n\nBut unfortunately, they'd have to examine what selfish fucks they've been, and that CANNOT happen. So instead, they berate and gaslight you.\n\nNTA\n\n-from a former fellow stocking afterthought sufferer", "Okay, so you are the magic of Christmas. You are essentially that Christmas spirit and the Little Spirit of Christmas because you do everything and get nothing. Good for you for standing up and saying no, because seriously, every year, we women do everything for Christmas and get basically nothing in return. And if we do get gifts, it's not really gifts that we want or like. It's what they think they have to get us. I mean, if I get one more soap or candle or bath bomb, I'm going to scream! You are not selfish. You are finally saying no enough is enough, and I'm done. They are only saying anything now because they're realizing how much you do and how little they ever contribute, and it's making them feel bad and guilty.  Which isn't what you were intending, but if that's what they are feeling, then that's on them, not you. The kids are little and don't pay attention to anything as long as they have things in their stocking from Santa. NTA", "YTA. You need to talk with your family and start delegating. You can\u2019t take on everything and expect others to step up. It doesn\u2019t work like that. You\u2019ve created a habit and others benefit from it. If you want people to start showing up for you, you need to talk to them and make that clear. This hissy fit is just that. This is not how we get our needs met, this is passive aggressive", "NTA. They know what they do sucks, they just don\u2019t want you to make them feel bad.", "There's a bad Christmas movie for every situation haha", "Congratulations on missing the point.\n\nShe's not pissed off because she's not getting gifts, it's because she does all the work (decorating, gift giving for teachers, family, mail man..) and gets nothing in return.", "I think she's trying to show him that if she doesn't buy the kids Christmas gifts then they have no gifts because he doesn't help out.", "My birthday is close to Christmas. One year, my boyfriend at the time got me three different robes for b-day/xmas.", "I can't stop laughing that skit,  this is so true!!!!", "I immediately thought of this skit! It\u2019s sad, funny, and true!", "I literally just bought a robe for myself for my dec birthday\u2026from goodwill. \n\nYay!", "I got a waffle maker.  Not once in 20 years did I convey any message about wanting to make a waffle  much less having a necessity for maker.", "I came here just to see if this skit had been posted!", "Yeah, I actually fall into this camp. Decorations are nice, but I don\u2019t care! And to set a super high bar every year and then feel resentful that others aren\u2019t matching your effort\u2014well, do they share your values? If not, what\u2019s this really about? Not feeling valued in general?", "Yeah\u2026 like I said, grow up.  Who does she THINK does all the Christmas work in every other house, the elves? No, it\u2019s done by the adult(s) who want it to happen.  She wants it to happen, but she wants OTHER people to also want it. That\u2019s not how any of this works.", "Man, it's really depressing to see so many people (mostly ladies) being hitched with so many thoughtless partners. Also, NTA.", "I actually want fuzzy socks but nobody buys me gifts anymore. I\u2019ll get an afterthought gift from son and DIL and younger son is broke and lazy. When they were little my mother bought presents to give me from them, which was super sweet. Now that my kids are grown I kinda hate Christmas.", "Not sure honestly. My daughter insisted on putting my shoes out this year. I told her I'm too old to get presents.\n\nWell. I got broth.", "A bag of potatoes! Marvelous!\n\nCheers to really bad presents, that make you go 'Huh?!?!' for years and years to come.", "The rest of the family clearly only wants it when SHE does all the work. It shouldn't work this way, they should all be pulling their weight if they want to make Christmas magical.\n\nThey clearly want Christmas to 'work' because they're shaming her for not wanting to partake in the gift giving!", "NTA. \n\nSo, hey. I run all the bookkeeping at my house.\n\n Yes, I do it with  Quickbooks (that should be a bumper sticker!). \n\nYes, I organize most of the presents, all the baking and about half the decorating.  Husband wraps. Yay! \n\nYes, there's a set amount for each of us and our grown kids. And...I just get him cash for the amount the family allots  for me, or tsf to his (small) personal checking account. He can spend more from what he's saved from his birthday gifts or whatever. \n\nNo, I don't have my own personal checking, because I'm in CHARGE OF IT ALL. Evil laugh... That's how we roll. \n\nJust saying, it ain't rocket science to get gift money for you to the person who should spend it on your behalf. And yes, he does my stocking, too. \n\nGeez, people.", "I totally get you and this same treatment, but I just figure (my husband) I buy stuff with his account all the time! so I don't mind since its christmas, birthday , anniversary, mother's day all year long :)", "Not at 4 and 2 but OP and husband don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re resolving the issue, so sooner or later the kids will get that Christmas makes Mommy resent Daddy", "At least she wasn't gifted a vacuum cleaner!\n\nYes, I got a vacuum last Christmas. Ugh...", "Wait, did he get you a shotgun or a gun rack?\n\nBoth are bad, I'm just confused.", "My big Christmas gift this year was a barely used treadmill that we bought off of a friend a few weeks ago. That friend, my husband, and two other friends got it into my basement and reassembled. I'm happy as a clam, and it's definitely something that I wanted.", "In our house we call those bowling balls, from that episode of The Simpson where Homer bought Marge a bowling ball with his name on it for his birthday.", "I think the joke from Wayne's World was about the gunrack.", "On the other hand, my dad has an (8 year) girlfriend I don't like very much.  When I give my dad christmas/birthday presents she usually says \"you just bought that so you could inherit it eventually, right?\".\n\nAbsolutely not, they're things I thought he'd like.  He uses most of them pretty often.  I'm in my 30s so I can afford decent gifts."]}
