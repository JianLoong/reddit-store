Leave him a handy list of all the people/things you have been purchasing for all these years and then put your feet up. You deserve a break.", "NTA.  Celebrate the day with your children, spoil them rotten, and ignore anyone who makes no effort for you. Include the kids and people like the mailman, garbage man, and teacher (they do a lot for you! And it's lovely that you appreciate them!) but yeah, don't go above and beyond for people who don't do anything for you.\n\nAlso, can I suggest that you get gifts \"from the kids\" that are only addressed to you with the money that you save from buying stuff for everyone else, and you fill your own stocking with cute little treats and enjoy it by yourself. Like, you've earned some nice stuff! Those expensive but really nice chocolates and biscuits you can only justify getting at Christmas, a cute jumper, silly socks, a pamper kit/spa day, a new computer game, or whatever it is you're into!\n\nHave a good Christmas OP, I wish you and your children all the best <3", "NTA. If the kids even notice/ask, then there's any number of ways to explain it without disrupting things, or even reinforcing things.\n\nIf your family is one where the stockings are filled by 'Santa', then it's easy enough to say something like, \"oh, I already have so many gifts coming from you and your Dad and everyone else, I barely even know where to put them all! So this year I wrote to Santa and told him that I don't need any more presents, and what would make me happiest would be if he could give the things for my stocking to other kids instead\" etc.\n\nBe wary that your husband (and the other family members) may be using the kids as a cover for their *own* discomfort at seeing you 'break tradition' (this year it's no stocking, what will it be next year, no tree?). Might be worth asking if that is really what is going on.", "From one over exhausted, only person who puts in any effort mum at Xmas to another, NTA!! I feel exactly the same this year and I'm just not participating in the farce. My husband is getting exactly the amount of effort he puts in, zero, and I've gone to town on just my kids. I've told family we're doing Xmas alone at home which is exactly what I want and I feel so relaxed.", "NTA. Nothing is stopping them filling and putting up a stocking for you and each other if the grown ups getting trinkets is so important to them. You're taking care of your kids, which is all you're required to do: anything beyond that should be group contribution, so they can contribute or shush.", "NTA cuz I have BEEN THERE, sis. It all came to a head one year when the sum total of my Christmas gifts was a cooking pot and a $5 electric toothbrush. Like not even a good one like Oral-B or whatever, this was a $5 Colgate disposable toothbrush that you had to just throw out when the battery died. I was just like, what the ACTUAL fuck! This came after I spent serious time and effort and money on everyone else and they apparently all assumed that someone else had gotten something for me so none of them did. What the hell was that toothbrush about anyway??? I cooked dinner every night for my sons and I have very good dental hygiene, it couldn't have been a hint--20 years later I STILL get confused and upset when I think about it.\n\nSo yeah, OP, fuck that noise. Good for you on getting out before your own \"toothbrush\" moment.", "NTA. But sometimes moms/wives put themselves into the exhaustion position by trying to \"do it all\" to start with. Kids don't need an advent calendar (or dad can go buy it for them). Cookies don't need to be baked (or dad can bake with the kids), and Elf on the Shelf is a stupid thing some asshole started to make moms feel guilty if they don't do it right.\n\nAnd why are you planning and cooking Christmas dinner by yourself? Surely your husband at least does the clean up afterwards?\n\nSo no, NTA for saying \"enough\". Sit down with your kids and find out what traditions they like best. Then do those, but share the workload.\n\nBut spitefully taking down your stocking is kinda... childish. Leave it up and be graceful about whatever ends up in there on Christmas morning. Why would you need to feel bad about what gets put in there, or doesn't? *It's not your responsibility.*", "Info: when you say you're not getting anybody presents, are you including your children in that?", "NTA,\nI think that maybe a conversation is due with your husband. He needs to be more thoughtful and show he cares more.", "INFO: Did you try and speak to your husband and family members first that you'd like them to make an effort and help out more? \n\nYou're NTA but some people are really bad at gifts and need to be assigned things to do.

Also...speak the heck up and DELEGATE. But...you can't micromanage and insist everything is done your way.

If they want to do something nice for my parents, great.  Regardless, we now have a relaxed holiday doing what we like, eating what we like, and with no forced expectations.\n\nIf your family (aside from your little ones) want the \"Christmas magic,\" they need to generate their own magic and contribute so that EVERYONE  - and that means you, too - gets to enjoy the holiday.\n\nAnd DO NOT cook a full holiday meal.  Make every adult contribute to the meal.  Who cares about the perfect holiday meal??  Whoever does can make (or buy) those parts that have meaning to them.  I myself like snacks.  Charcuterie.

When it came to stockings, he and I went in halves on my son's stocking, he and my mom would go in halves on my stocking, and I would entirely do my mother's stocking.\n\nMaybe it is time to force a new routine on your family. Maybe, you and your husband should switch up each year which kid you are each going to take care of with gifts stocking and all. One year you take care of your son and he takes care of your daughter, and the next year you switch it around and you get the daughter and he gets the son. As for all of the adults in the house, I think it's time to put names in a hat, everyone draws a name and that is the person they have to completely concentrate on for gifts and the filling of a stocking.\n\nYou are already learning that there does not need to be a kabillion hand baked treats, and millions of decorations everywhere for to feel festive and wonderful in a house. It also absolutely would not kill the other adults in their house to help with the making of the Christmas Day feast.\n\nIt's easy to feel burnt out, when you feel that you are being taken advantage of, and truly underappreciated.

But it hella sounds like you DO in fact care, and you are taking your stockings down to show them how this whole thing is upsetting for you. \n\nThis doesn't make you an asshole, so I'm not changing my judgement but maybe consider having an adult conversation with all the other adults about how to Christmas in this house.\n\nYou know, talk about your expectations, hear the expectations of the other adults in that house, talk about how you want this season to be for the kids. In a lot of households it's pretty common for the adults to not gift each other, or to pre-plan bigger gifts, or to limit spending on the gifts, heck, some families even do a \"secret Santa\" style gifting procedure, or maintain wish-lists so the other relatives know what everyone would want or like.

There\u2019s more than one other adult in the house, and they can\u2019t collectively fill a stocking? Really?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s spiteful at all to take down the stocking so that she isn\u2019t reminded for yet another year that no one can be bothered. Telling her to essentially suck it up because no one owes her gifts but she should still act as if they will is not a great take.", "I also can't shake the feeling that she does all these things but like... no one really expects her to, or not to that extent, or at least no one would be upset if it wouldn't reach the extreme levels of *perfection*. \n\nOP, if your family is pressuring you into doing all this - Ew. Fuck that.
