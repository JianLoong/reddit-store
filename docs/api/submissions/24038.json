Well, yesterday he came into the kitchen and asked about the redecorating, as he can see stuff in the bar and bathroom. I explained what I was doing.\r  \n\r  \nHe FREAKED out on me, saying that i'm trying to force him back into being a girl by painting everything so feminine. We went back and forth for over an hour, with the conversation ending with me telling him that he can either suck it up or move out and pay rent somewhere. My dad also made him sign a renter\u2019s contract, even though he wasn't paying rent. I made sure to bring this up, saying that if he wanted to fight about it then I can give him his 30 day notice. \r  \n\r  \nFYI- his areas are not being turned pink, except the bar he uses as a kitchen.

My dad\u2019s side believes that my grandma left me the house because I always loved it and she knew my pink dream for it, so I shouldn't have to wait because someone doesn't even pay rent on it. \n\nThe house is in my name, was left to me, and I just really really want to decorate it. I love how every room comes together and it's exactly how I wanted it. I\u2019m going to be disappointed if I don\u2019t go through with it. And my dad has spent so much on it already.

In fact the clothing for children in the 19th century was almost always white, since, before the invention of chemical dyes, clothing of any color would quickly fade when washed in boiling water.\"\n\n\"A dress parade, held in 1949, at the famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, caused a stir among attendees due to the vibrant pink tones in the dresses and garments. The journalists and critics of the time, seeking to know Mexican designer Ram\u00f3n Valdiosera's inspiration, asked him about the origin of the color. The artist simply replied that that pink was already part of Mexican culture, which the New York fashion critic Perle Mesta then described as Mexican Pink.\"\n\n\"The First inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953), when Eisenhower's wife Mamie Eisenhower wore a pink dress as her inaugural gown, is thought to have been a key turning point in the association of pink as a color associated with girls. Mamie's strong liking of pink led to the public association with pink being a color that \"ladylike women wear.\"\"\n\n\"The transition to pink as a sexually differentiating color for girls occurred gradually, through the selective process of the marketplace, in the 1930s and 40s. In the 1920s, some groups had described pink as a masculine color, an equivalent to red, which was considered for men but lighter for boys. But stores nonetheless found that people were increasingly choosing to buy pink for girls, and blue for boys, until this became an accepted norm in the 1940s.\"\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink\n\nIn essence, your cousin's an idiot who needs to stop assuming everything everyone does is deliberately meant as a slight against him.

That STILL wouldn't make you the asshole, obviously, but I'm just trying to work out what might be going on.\n\nI have a cousin whose parents really suck, and all this cousin's childhood their parents would force them to have everything pink.

So that cousin spent a long time *hating* pink, because it's so strongly associated with their parents' attempts to control them.\n\n(they like pink, now, when they choose to wear it)\n\nI wonder, maybe it might be worth it to sit down with your cousin and say something like, \"Hey, you know I love you, as you *are*, and I would *never* want to try to force you to change.  I want to understand a bit better - is there a particular reason you feel so strongly about pink?  Like, I really like pink, but I know some people will use pink as, like, a girlifying weapon [or however you want to phrase that]...?\".

He expects you bend to his whims about the decor of YOUR house? While living there your rent-free? Hell no. Decorate YOUR house however the hell you want. Your cousin can, indeed, either suck it up, or move out and go pay rent somewhere else. \n\nTwo. Your cousin is being ridiculous. Pink is just a colour. The whole idea of \u201cgirl colours\u201d and \u201cboy colours\u201d is completely made up (in fact, prior to about the 1950s, it was actually reversed - pink was a \u201cmasculine\u201d colour because it was like \u201clight red\u201d and red was associated with anger, masculinity, and strength, and blue was a \u201cfeminine\u201d colour because it was associated with the Virgin Mary.)\n\nOh, and your maternal family is insane. You are not transphobic for decorating your own damn house your preferred colour. And you shouldn\u2019t be expected to bow to your cousin\u2019s (who, again, you are letting live with you for free!) every demand or be called transphobic. He and your maternal family don\u2019t get to use accusations of transphobia as a stick to hit you with until they get their way. \n\nI\u2019m surprised your cousin is being like that tbh.

He may be uncomfortable with the color, and his feelings are valid, but that's his issue that he needs to work on. Its YOUR house that your painting colors YOU like. He can't demand someone not paint their own home the colors they want especially if hes not contributingto anything financially. Certainly not for 2 years and after its already been paid for. You painting your house pink and colorful isn't going to turn him into a girl anymore than its going to turn your boyfriend into a girl. He has to know that. He can't just cry transphobia and have a tantrum cause he's not getting what he wants and it's terrible your mom's side is enabling that behavior. I just really don't like when people take serious issues to try and manipulate people into giving them what they want.

I did not say the things you are accusing me of saying at all. I think the fact you keep seeing words that I did not say is deeply concerning, and you should get help.", "Yeah honestly I thought it was closer to that but couldn't solidly remember so I just over estimated to be safe since it kept the point the same", "I understand but somethings just are.
