Moreover, this happens in a childish manner with other group apps instead of just talking it out. At the beginning of the year, we maybe should have discussed what Alex needed and asked at every party where there might be accessibility bottlenecks.\n\nI know it can be terribly frustrating if you can't participate in something due to a lack of accessibility and our association just doesn't seem to have been accessible enough.

Instead of being appreciative of what you've tried to do for him, he pushes for more. And you can't change the notion of the club to be about him.", "NTA. At this point your reasons are because of Alex's behavior and personality. Not because they are in a wheelchair. You are all doing your best, with the limited knowledge you have, to accommodate Alex. If it's not enough for them then while that sucks. It's just that. It sucks. \n\n\nDon't let Alex stop your meet ups, especially the ones that are social and outside the organization. If they say they aren't able to make it then...well thats just one they will have to miss out on.\n\n\nYou guys have put in the effort. If it's not enough for Alex then they need to help find compromises or places that can accommodate that are also within everyone's budget. It should not be up to you guys and a game of \"how about this place\" after all the previous efforts you e already put in.", "NTA\nSounds like you all tried your best to be as inclusive as possible but it's just never good enough. \nIt's a shame our world still isn't more accessible as a rule, but that is hardly your fault.", "INFO- In HR in the US when you accommodate someone you go through interactive process.  This sounds entirely one-sided...you come up with ideas and Alex vetoes it.   Have you asked Alex what spaces work for him and his wheelchair?  Have you brainstormed ideas together that could include everyone?  Have you simply say down and talked about these challenges?", "NTA, though I\u2019m not sure I would impose any negative moral judgement on Alex either. This was all around just very uncomfortable to read, and I hope no friendships were broken.", "NTA. You tried to accommodate him as well as you could and unfortunately there were things outside of your control that limited your ability to do that. People not wanted to be around him has nothing to do with the wheel chair and everything to do with the AH that's in it.", "Info: have you had any social events that are wheelchair accessible? If so how often do these occur?", "Nah; it\u2019s rubbish for Alex that they can\u2019t access the same areas as you although you\u2019re trying to be inclusive. Maybe you should do a meet up in the accessible pub occasionally though, even if it\u2019s just for a drink and not everyone can afford it regularly. I don\u2019t think anyone is an ass though, you\u2019re trying to accommodate but the world isn\u2019t ready yet", "YTA, when you accepted this person into the association, a responsibility came with it. One of those responsibilities is making sure that every person can be at an activity and that members don't exclude each other.", "YTA - it's not his fault that wheelchair accessability is so bad where you are , you should be lambasting the venues that aren't. You've been given a window into the problems that wheelchair users face, and your response isn't to help, isn't to promote more accessabilty, or search out solutions.
