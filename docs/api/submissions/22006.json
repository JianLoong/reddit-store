Have been where you are, sadly you just have to accept that if you treat him how he deserves (honestly just boot him from anything you guys are in), there are going to be some people who think you're treating him this way because of his disability and will not be dissuaded from that view.\n\nIf he only has a physical disability with no mental component, then it sounds like he's using it as an excuse for his poor behaviour, either as unconscious learned behaviour or a conscious decision.
