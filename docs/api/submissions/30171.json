In reality they're the same thing, redditors are just hypocrites. The only thing you need to make sure when using nepotism is that you're daughter isn't a dumbass and doesn't abuse the position given.

A good way to pay it forward would be to have your daughter also right your girlfriend's son a recommendation from a friend recognizing wholesomeness and desire for education and to be part of what's going on.
