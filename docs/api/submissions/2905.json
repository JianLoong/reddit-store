Now the parents know that whoever they left in charge is not satisfactory to be left in charge, and your smug stepsister gets to worry about how the parents will react to her thumbing her nose at the rules.\n\nIt's just too bad you didn't give her a smug look back when she made her little comment about how you couldn't take a joke.\n\nThere are lots of parents who don't appreciate their kids having unwanted guests over when they aren't at home.   I never disrespected my parents in that way, and I know for a fact that they wouldn't have taken such an action very kindly.\n\nOne of my siblings tried to plan a party for when my parents were going out of town (I was already moved out), but they caught wind of what my sibling was planning so they waited for my sibling to leave, changed the locks, and went on their trip.  I don't even know where my sibling went while they were on that trip but no party happened while they were gone at their home!", "NTA - stepsister broke the rules, not your problem if she gets into trouble over it.", "Snitching cuz someone smirked while you were covered in mud?  What are you 6? YTA", "NTA. All you did was post a picture. They don\u2019t know what petty means if they think that was petty.", "You both sound delightful.", "She broke the rules. NTA", "NTA- Honestly if you want someone to cover for you and keep your secrets you are NICE to them. My sisters on numerous occasions broke rules and I absolutely sold them out over it because they were not kind to me.", "YTA. If I came home, covered in mud, I would expect some form of a comment from my brother, more than likely at my expense, because it would be funny. To them. It's not like they knew how bad your day was, they're just reacting to the information they currently had. She wasn't being vindictive, mean, mocking, or purposely trying to make you feel bad, she just reacted to what she saw, which she found funny. Realistically, would you have told on your sister if she hadn't smirked? OR did you do it because you wanted her to have a bad day like you did? Being petty and getting her in trouble when she just had 2 friends over watching a game, not like they were having a party, is a huge overreaction to a smirk and it makes you look vindictive.", "Yes, yes you\u2019re TA. Let\u2019s not pretend you care about the rules, you wanted to get her in trouble arbitrarily.", "YTA - I love all the people stating N.T.A because your sister broke the \"rules\". Its pretty much expected for friends to come over when parents are on vacation. Everyone stating N.T.A sounds like a bunch of fun. Also, you fell in mud and you're upset because your sister \"smirked\"?? thats perfectly reasonable and if anything, pretty small. Obviously, she should not make fun of your hard day, but come on now. Would not be surprised if this put a bigger wedge in your relationships. I would not want to spend a second with you.", "ESH. And this post reinforced my childfree status lol", "Soft YTA. I'm sorry you had a bad day, i get why you were pissy, but your parents are on their honeymoon and this wasn't an emergency so you didn't need to be making them deal with some squabbles when they're on their honeymoon and you're about to graduate.\n\nAlso, your stepsister might have smirked at you, but it sounds like she was just chilling with some friends. They hardly threw a rager in your livingroom.\n\nedit sp/a word", "YTA and so is your sister. Feels like you're both little sh..", "YTA. Mind your business and don\u2019t be petty. Handle the issues you have by talking about them. Don\u2019t snitch just to get revenge. \n\nMy sister was constantly snitching on me for every tiny thing that I did. I was constantly in trouble and now I don\u2019t talk to any of my family. Let her live her life. You\u2019re too old for this shit.", "NTA\n\nShe violated the rules.", "NTA", "NTA, but you definitely didn\u2019t help the situation with her not liking you.", "ETA. Seems like you had a bad day and yes your sister was petty to smirk at you and i understand tit for tat but you went abit further then her by tattling to your parents. Its not like she was having a party and honestly if the roles were reversed you wouldnt have laughed at her for falling in a puddle? \n\nYou said you dont have many rules because your just about to graduate so this means your both nearly adults, seems like the pair of you both need to grow up abit more and stop being petty towards each other.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA and this is ridiculous. She FAFO with mom's rules. She's mad that you got back at her by being an informant, lol. Maybe put a bug in her mom's ear about needing cams in hidden corners. And make sure you aren't breaking the rules...", "NTA. I can't imagine not caring if my sister fell in the mud.", "Nta 1 she didn\u2019t respect your parents rules 2 it sounds like there\u2019s underlying issues that happened before this and if she\u2019s hateful towards you why cover for her  3 you telling your parents doesn\u2019t make you an ah in my opinion either because your stepbrother isn\u2019t there to be \u201cin charge\u201d and 4 everyone even kids have bad days there\u2019s grown adults out there doing way worse then \u201csnitching\u201d how anyone is saying yta and they sound childish themselves", "YTA revenge isnt the answer and petty", "A better question is why the fuck do you care? You and your new sister need to grow the fuck up.", "Wait. How did she mock you? Sounds like you just had a shit day and wanted to take it out on someone else.", "NTA. Rules are rules. If she wants to be a bully then she can learn to suffer from the consequences.", "YTA- it was funny that you were covered in mud. They responded normally and you decided to be very overdramatic. I\u2019m sure your parents are happy with you, but good luck having your siblings help you out anytime soon.", "NTA", "ESH. I get the impulse, I've done it too. The righteous vindication is glorious. Not a great habit, mind you, but your impulse control is still developing. You had a shitty day, your stepsister was making it worse, you spread the pain around. Vindictive? Yes. Earned? Mostly. A good choice? Not really. But actions have consequences, it might behoove you to examine your consequences.", "Sofy ESH you were trying to hurt eachother over nothing\n\nSnitchimg on something like that is petty when you're almost adults\n\nAnd life will be easier for you if you learn not to make drama", "Are we really going to qualify a \u201csmirk\u201d as not being nice to somebody?", "you must not have siblings\u2026", "Yeah. My brother got some beer when he was underage, and my parents were both out of town (I think he would've been a sophomore or junior in high school). He let me know about it, and I immediately told my parents because I did not want to be the adult in the house for several drunk high schoolers.", "Sounds like some hormonal teenager shit.", "plus, she fucked it up for everyone. the parents honeymoon is ruined and now all three of them have to lose their freedom AND hear their parents mouth \ud83d\ude12.", "that doesn\u2019t matter because we all know that\u2019s not what this is about\u2026", "Doing something because it is the right thing or what you believe in is the right thing.\n\nBut the step-sister just 'smirked' at OP? Either OP has a very acrimonious history with their step-sister, OP has some issues from another source, or OP is really very petty.\n\nI think OP should reflect upon their familial situation if they blow up at THAT.", "OP said they don't like each other, and the sister even mentioned \"can't take a joke\".\n\nTo be honest, if it wasn't for this last take, I would've agreed with you. But I understand my position can be fairly contested.", "But they're not siblings, they're teenagers who only recently became stepsiblings. They weren't raised together and you can't really expect them to have that sibling bond and tolerance for each other.", "That\u2019s literally what the poster asked about. I didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t petty, but it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of complete asshole.

Ive known both quite a while and we've lived together for awhile too.  Of course they're family lol I was just being petty IG in calling them that", "fuck siblings. evb knows you don\u2019t snitch when y\u2019all both could\u2019ve gotten in trouble .", "she didn\u2019t gaf about the rules, she was just mad cs her stepsister smirked at her \ud83d\ude2d..", "Ah, that does put a different spin on things! Sorry for assuming, with the wedding so recent I assumed a shorter amount of living together. There's a very different vibe and very different sense of boundaries when stepsiblings meet when they're older.\n\nI'd vote ESH, petty but kind of deserved lol!", "It\u2019s okay to be hurt and upset. We were all kids once. If the sister hadn\u2019t broken the rules, there wouldn\u2019t have been this problem.", "YTA. And you know it. That's obvious from your own comments.", "YTA she didn\u2019t mock you anywhere in your story.", "YTA.\nOkay she broke the rule but claiming she mocked you? I\u2018m sorry but bad days happen and if you see a video of someone falling in a puddle you might laugh too. Well now you fell into one, had a messy face (luckily you were not injured!) and wanted to make her evening as bad as yours which was petty of you. You should apologize for being petty and that just because you had a bad evening didn\u2018t gave you the right to destroy hers too just because she smiled and didn\u2018t say anything. You would had been justified if she really mocked you and made jokes but she didn\u2018t.", "YTA unless I missed something... You said your sister smirked only? She didn't point out your state to her friends or make fun of you in any way? She didn't even laugh out loud? I can't mentally make the jump from \"I'm covered in mud and my sister smirked (cause I most likely looked hilarious) so I tattled on her for having two friends over watching a game\". I completely understand having a horrible day but I think perhaps you may have taken it all out on one person in your frustration.", "YTA. Being a tattletale isn't a good look.", "NTA. Just tell them it was just a joke, cant they take a joke, like ever. For sure for sure, what ever. Oh my god Becki...", "Info: did she actually mock you as your title says? Your story doesn't even have her saying anything to you.", "It's not a joke unless everyone is laughing\n\nMaybe you were petty, but what comes around goes around\n\nNTA", "You reap what you sow. I always have to laugh at people who get in trouble after they literally are acting like complete and total jerks. Especially in front of their friends together favor. You are not the asshole. And don\u2019t let them convince you otherwise.", "NTA. Since I am petty, I would have done the same thing. \ud83d\ude02", "ESH!!! You were both petty.", "I love it", "If the situation would be reversed I\u2018m sure op (and honestly many people) would had smirked too. I would had asked if she is ok or wants to talk but I don\u2018t know if I would had managed to not have a quick smile first.", "oh hey i think our avatars are lil buddies!", "Its hard for me to explain but she aways does that little smirk when making someone.  Ive seen her do it whenever something embarrassing happens but wants to be quiet about it"]}
