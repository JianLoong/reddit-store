You are not being unreasonable and asked in a polite manner proposing reasonable compromises.  Having a son with ADHD, her response is not overly surprising since they get very invested in their coping techniques.  If there is an HR department like you mention, this is a good place to try to come to some resolution or this will not end and/or you will be reported and have to deal with this from a defensive position instead of a problem solving position.", "NTA - I\u2019d request to move. If that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019d escalate to my manager.", "NTA. You made perfectly reasonable suggestions.\n\nHer management system would absolutely destroy any ability to work for anyone else, let zlone alone those of us also with ADHD.  No reason why she couldn't use earbuds or switch to a different her-only means of notification. \n\nHopefully you can have a word with her boss.", "NTA...If it's bothering you, it must be bothering others as well.  I'm sure she does have struggles, but there must be a better solution.", "NTA. She doesn't have the right to interfere with other people's functioning to mitigate her disability. That's unreasonable and she needs to come up with a better solution. In addition to your proposals, devices like Fitbits can be set up with vibrating alarms that wouldn't disturb anyone else, for example. You should lodge a complaint with HR over the work disruption this causes.", "Nope. Her coping mechanisms are making everyone else\u2019s work experience harder.
