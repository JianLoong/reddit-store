I absolutely agree that OP is NTA and should follow the proper order of issue reporting in their company, which is generally first talking to the co-worker (which OP has done), then direct supervisor(s), then HR. OP also needs to document absolutely everything, noting dates, times, conversations and witnesses of anything related to the issue. OP shouldn\u2019t complain on behalf of others though. They need to voice their concerns themselves or it will look like they\u2019re \u201cganging up\u201d on the employee.

ADHDers are literally blind to time.  10mins and 10 hours can feel the same to us.  This is akin to asking someone not to use their wheelchair.\n\nWhile other ADHDers may function with less intrusive accomodations, some of us need something jarring to break our hyperfocising.  Maybe ask hear to use ear buds would be a compromize but do not mistake the fact that they are trying to work around a disability that is constant and modern work is the worst environment for it.", "Also, as someone who does this same thing (sets alarms and reminders to help time manage) but who ALSO HATES NOISES, especially alert sounds, I use an Apple Watch with haptics. Doesn\u2019t bother or startle me or anyone else!", "Baby-tattling is ALWAYS the answer.", "Because what works for you works for every ADHDer?", "I also have ADHD and used alarms for time management. NTA, I have three alarms in my working day like check points, in my activity band? Basic SmartWatch? ( Mi band of Xiaomi). It only vibrates, it is practically silent for the rest of the people. Maybe you could suggest this option. (One new costs like 35\u20ac).", "Not to mention that other people in the office may have ADHD as well, perhaps undisclosed or undiagnosed. If I was her coworker, as someone with ADHD who received a late diagnosis, this environment would have probably cause me to rage quit.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Exactly. Maybe it's different for others but my ADHD seems to make me way more sensitive to random noises than most folk so I'm honestly surprised the co-worker doesn't appreciate the impact it's having on others.", "As someone with ADHD, I totally get the need for alarms. Personally I prefer reminders where they vibrate/take up the screen just to make them less obtrusive. I'm so self conscious I could never have my alarms at full volume in the workplace, and as someone also autistic, having a loud blaring noise going off at random repeatedly sounds like an absolute hellscape.", "And as another ADHD-er, if I had to hear alarms go off all of the time, I would never be able to focus! I don\u2019t think enough people realize that a \u201creasonable\u201d accommodation means just that.", "Can you charge toe phone at your desk?. When you have lunch, \u201cfeed\u201d your phone, too", "And CC or BCC HR on the email", "Everyone is trying to do their best.\n\nWhen your coping mechanisms impact others, things need to be adjusted", "I feel personally attacked haha \n\nI got one of them alarms that has the colour, so you twist it round and then mine is pink and you can visually see how much time you have left \n\nThe noise isn\u2019t too jarring but does beep \n\nBut it works because I feel too \u201cguilty\u201d adding more time cause you can see it with the colour if that makes sense it just works better for me than being able to hit a snooze button", "I don\u2019t know if I have anything but I fucking love vibrating alarms for everything! Let\u2019s my mind be clear and not worry about time in the moment.", "I was really annoyed to have bought a knockoff Fitbit only to find that I could not program it to receive my reminders or alarms. Other than the fitness stuff it seemed to only have the kinds of functions where you'd rather have your actual phone in your hand.", "I have a Fitbit, and ADHD. A daily vibrating alarm is the only way I've been able to stick to a new habit I've never been able to stick to long term. I do snooze the alarm until I am able to do the task, but it is definitely quieter than a regular phone alarm.", "comment-copying spam/scam bot", "I have to leave mine ringing until I do whatever the thing is because if I turn them\noff  I will forget they have gone off literally 3 seconds later. But sometimes even then after a few minutes my brain tunes out the sound of the ringer lol", "Me with my 5 wake-up alarms", "The watch vibration is enough to wake me up in the morning. I don\u2019t use sound on my phone almost ever but use a bunch of alarms for different things. I think this is a very good compromise that would work well.", "That very much depends on the backstory of everyone involved here. \n\nOP said that the co-worker has shared with her how hard she finds managing her time. That suggests they have an amiable relationship and that there was some trust there.\n\nPresumably that trust felt betrayed when OP then asked her to stop using the very strategies she had confided in her about needing. Sure, there are compromises that could be reached, but maybe the conversation felt confrontational and the co-worker got defensive. People with ADHD are more likely to feel betrayed, not to mention say things impulsively. Maybe OP isn\u2019t as diplomatic as she thinks she is even if she is calm and kind.\n\nOP asked if she was T A and the answer is no. If the co-worker is serious and goes to HR first, OP hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. There\u2019s no suggestion that the co-worker would lie about the interaction - she\u2019s just upset about it. So it would likely backfire on her.\n\nIf OP has enough of a relationship with the co-worker to be able to clear the air and get things resolved without needing HR, that seems like the best solution to me - but that depends on their relationship. \n\nThat also maybe depends on what country this is. I\u2019m applying European \u201csort your shit out yourselves\u201d HR rules here, I have no idea about North America.", "H", "Look at PillPack. They put your meds into a strip of packets with the date and time they are to be taken printed on them along with the medication and dose. Handy when traveling too. \n\nThey ship them to you a few weeks before the date that you need to start that roll.", "Those giant, ugly pillboxes are a life saver!  I've used one for 10 years and I still forget sometimes, ugh - they make me feel so old!", "omg what I will have to look for these", "they make pill bottle caps that tell u when u last opened it! super helpful definitely recommend. some of the fancier ones u can *also* set an alarm on if ur so inclined", "I had a client one time that when he took his pills would turn the bottle upside down. Then before he went to bed, would reset all the bottles for the next day. He took tons of pills for various things and said it was the only way he could remember if he took them all or not.", "We use the pill boxes *and* an alarm on our phones but since mine is paired with my fitness watch -  it's on vibrate so it doesn't bother anyone but me.", "it absolutely works lol. I tend to wake up a bunch at night and in the morning, and when I lived with family they had cats and they'd hear the bottles rattle they'd all come running! definitely can't forget taking my meds when I'm mobbed by kitties :)", "Until they start tricking you into taking your pill twice.", "I got mine at Rite Aid and it fits their bottles, but you can also search \"timer medication cap\" or \"timer medication bottle\" and there's all sorts of different kinds available at different price points :) I bought some for my brother's mom off amazon I believe. they even have some that just stick on to the side of the bottle and you flip a switch once a day, then reset at the end of the week. I hope you find some that work for you!!", "This is genius!", "It's definitely the coolest, most wholesome way to remember to take it. I will let my son know about this trick if he needs a reminder.", "thanks for the information, I will look into this asap!"]}
