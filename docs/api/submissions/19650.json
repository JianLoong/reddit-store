She has a right to her alarms and you have a right to be able to hear your clients. Unfortunately, peace and quiet are impossible in a cubicle environment.

If the request comes from management and is a reasonable accommodation for her medical condition she has no excuse for complaining to HR.", "NTA. I have ADHD and even with medication I still regularly misses tasks. Use my iPhone alarm a whole lot too, but at work I change the settings to vibrate. She can also use other ways to remind herself - putting every task in Google calendar, use sticky notes, there are ADHD friendly task pads she can buy on Amazon, just to name a few.

The cheapest one is like $150 and she could probably find a used or refurbished one for like $100. I know that\u2019s still a lot for some people but if this is as vital as she claims, it seems like a good investment. Timers vibrate the watch on your wrist so it\u2019s pretty much impossible to miss them and even I can\u2019t hear it, just feel it.

They should not have to change their environment to be able to do their job without interruption.

The person causing the disruption is the one that needs to take action to resolve the problem. I absolutely agree that OP is NTA and should follow the proper order of issue reporting in their company, which is generally first talking to the co-worker (which OP has done), then direct supervisor(s), then HR. OP also needs to document absolutely everything, noting dates, times, conversations and witnesses of anything related to the issue. OP shouldn\u2019t complain on behalf of others though. They need to voice their concerns themselves or it will look like they\u2019re \u201cganging up\u201d on the employee. Workplace accommodations are usually available to help people do their jobs effectively, but should never have a negative impact on others. OP and other commenters here have made some great suggestions, but it sounds like Ms. ADHD is behaving a bit entitled here because not only did she reject them out of hand, she did so rudely. \nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m a mid-level people manager for a multi-billion dollar corporation in Canada and this is how situations like this are dealt with, the key is to document everything and follow the proper channels to address the issue, not run from it. I would never ask an employee to just move away from the problem, I admit that it\u2019s an easy way out for OP but the root problem has to be dealt with to ensure a respectful workplace environment for everyone. \n\nAlso, did you check between the couch cushions? \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude01", "I would also go to HR first, for these reasons and also to head it off when coworker inevitably goes with her version of the story", "I would second the part about leaving out the ADHD.
