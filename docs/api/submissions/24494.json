But asking you last minute to put your self in huge debt so he can have a lavish wedding (which is not a necessity) is insane.

No. He waits until afterwards and then expects you to cave.\n\nThis is utter crap.  Sure he supported you emotionally, and you can do likewise for him.

And I\u2019m sorry it he was not there for you - he was there for what he could get out of you!", "I  so sorry this was how you found out how little they all think of you, what a heartbreaking moment. \n  \n  You absolutely deserve better, the decision to cut ties (at least for the foreseeable) was correct and I\u2019m glad you can move onwards and upwards with your kid. \n  \n  NTA - no need to doubt yourself.", "*and our parents agreed.*\n\nlol wut? Who plans on paying their long term care expenses?", "NTA. If he wanted you to pay for his wedding, he should have discussed it with you in advance. If he couldn\u2019t afford the wedding he wanted, he should have downsized it.", "NTA.   I didn't realize  sibling support came with a price tag.\n\nEven if you were rich, I wouldn't have paid for his wedding, maybe he should save like other couples do or cut costs", "How did this conversation get anywhere past \u201cI don\u2019t have anything like that kind of money lying around?\u201d", "NTA\u2026.wait, what?   Who tells some one else that you are paying for their wedding?  And the parents agree?   If you cannot afford a 20,000 wedding, you do not have one.  I am so sorry for you.  Do not feel guilty about not giving your brother the money.  You can feel sad, disappointed and everything else about this situation and what it has done to you and will do.", "NTA your brother and parents have some nerve. You shouldn't feel guilty.", "NTA. What makes him think this is your responsibility!? You\u2019re a wounded vet. With a kid. He can pay his own way in life. That\u2019s assumed. I thought.", "No. He needs to pay for his own wedding...but usually the brides family pays for most of it. It seems crazy that they would ask you to.  I'm not really sure why your parents would want you to pay either. He needs to stand on his own now....", "That is a powerful quote.", "Like what the actual fuck? \n\nI guess OP didn't read the fine print of supportive brother contract where he agrees to pay $$ per interaction...bill due at bros wedding.\n\nOP is way better off without these entitled leeches \n\nNTA", "I liked the part where THEY decided that HE should pay the ENTIRE bill without asking him first.", "My favorite part (by which I mean the most fucked up part) is how *the parents* just volunteered OP's money to the brother just like that. No prior discussion, no finding out whether or not OP even *had* the money. No, they just decide to give away OP's money. And then the brother just expects OP to quietly comply with this whole arrangement. \n\nOP, I'm so sorry you're being put through this, and you're definitely NTA.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Something is definitely missing.", "Right?

Looks like he needs a life lesson.", "I'm honestly starting to think so, She's always been a very rude and nasty person to me and has made claims I have more money that I don't tell anyone about because I don't talk about my money. I just live under my means and always put my son first and I don't spend my money on dumb stuff (except Warhammer stuff) but yea I'm still gonna take a few more days before reaching out to him", " I am waiting for my payout but it'll only be around 10,000 then 4500 a month after that, the VA is a fun time to deal with.", "Not the OREO lol", "  The support he gave me after the military was some financial help around 5000, which I did try to pay back several times after I got a steady job and such but he never took it. After reading some comments and looking back at some things I truly feel like its his wife pushing him more towards this behavior but I'm still gonna take some time before talking to him agian.", "Agree. I don't think you cut off someone you love so quickly.

I was imagining a flat version of \" No angel.\"", "1. You and your brother had a great relationship, even if you are different\n\n2. You help with the wedding\n\n3. BAM, out of the blue he asks for $20k ???\n\n4. Some people can be very manipulative.  Maybe she wants a new car.  A new kitchen\u2026\u2026oh, your disable brother has a lot of money.  I hear disabled vets get a lot of $$$.  You\u2019ve done a lot for him so ask him to \u201cpay you back\u201d.  \n\n5. Or, you left key info out of the story but I doubt it.  \n\n6. If you choose to talk to your brother, instead of trying to prove who is right, ask him simply, where did you come up with the idea to ask me for $20k and why?   Don\u2019t argue about whether he should have or shouldn\u2019t have asked, just ask him where it came from.

Your brother\u2019s entitled behavior sounds so bizarre that he may be having (or soon have) some break with reality issues. He was a good friend to you in the past.

Thank him for the support the gave you when you needed it.\n\nIt sounds like that will pay for a 25% or so of the wedding debt.   You are paying him back what is owed.", "This is true. I think I needed to think about it more before I typed out my original comment. Thanks for replying.", "#4. Where do people get the idea that VA disability is a lot? I assumed this is what happened, as it's happened with folk around my hubby too. Just where doesthis idea come from??"]}
