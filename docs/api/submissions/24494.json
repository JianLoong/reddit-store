But asking you last minute to put your self in huge debt so he can have a lavish wedding (which is not a necessity) is insane.

No. He waits until afterwards and then expects you to cave.\n\nThis is utter crap.  Sure he supported you emotionally, and you can do likewise for him.

Especially family members asking. They should have an idea of what the vet went through that led to compensation in the first place, and be happy for the vet that they got what they were entitled to.\n\nFor context though, I was visiting my family when my brother-in-law opened a letter with over $60K in disability comp.

You are not responsible for your brother's financial matters. Your parents took it upon themselves to decide that you would pay for all of your brother's wedding? Where do they get the temerity to think that they have that kind of authority over you? Fuck it, you know what you should do? Go to mom and dad's house this weekend with some friends and some survey equipment, and just start doing some bullshit measurements. When your father comes out to find out what you're doing, tell him you're arranging to sell his house so you can pay for brother's wedding.

You are not obligated to pay for anything other than what you want to pay for.  Your brother has lost his mind and is the AH.  You, most certainly are NTA. Again, I am sorry you had to go thru this.  Thank-you for your service. I wish you well in the future.", "NTA. Wow, I am so sorry that your family is so crummy. Your brother made the choice to get $20k in debt for a wedding.

If bride/her family expected a lavish wedding, they should be right there picking up the bill.\n\nIf OP wants to help his brother he could give him a generous gift of whatever he can afford. Not pay for the whole thing if it would just shift the debt from brother to OP.\n\nAnd if OP gives them a DIME they better not be taking a honeymoon. (Our parents helped, but hubby and I paid for more than half of our wedding ourselves, and we budgeted the wedding so that no debt was involved by anyone, we could still furnish the house we just bought, and we didn\u2019t take our honeymoon until we\u2019d been married for two years so we could pay for it in cash.)", "Great idea! I got married in a \"micro wedding\" at a beautiful place. I don't see a need to accomodate a bunch of mostly strangers. Getting married during the pandemic was a blessing for me to be honest."]}
