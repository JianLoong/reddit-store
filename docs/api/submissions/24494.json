In addition to all of the other comments.... why isn't her family chipping in?  \n\nIn reality, they already have paid for all of this up front.  It's paid for, maybe on a credit card.  They can pay it off over time.  Definitely not your responsibility.  Springing that on you?  Nope.  I'd go NC for a while too, see how things go.  But I don't thnk I'd go with a \"Forever\" mindset.  He may come back to reality someday.  Hopefully soon.  Thank you for your service.", "NTA. Even if you had the money he'd have no right to ask for it. Like you said, it wasn't your wedding. It was his and he chode ti spend so much money on it. If he didn't have it, he shouldn't have spent it. That's just common sense.", "I think it would still be a good idea to give them a couple thousand, or however much you are willing to pay, just to affirm to him that you are still friends. \n\nBut yeah, the wedding putting him in debt is totally his problem, and wanting money from you that you don't even have is just an asshole move.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely positively NTA!! Your brother is being ridiculous! He\u2019s supported you mentally, emotionally and physically (?) but never financially by the sounds of it. Why should you be responsible to pay for $20K freaking wedding? Why does he feel so entitled to money (that you don\u2019t have btw) just because he\u2019s been your biggest supporter and friend??  I wonder if this is coming from his new wife honestly! If this is a side of him you\u2019ve never seen, makes me wonder!", "I would put out your prosthetics, put it in his hand and tell him.\"sell it, I think I can walk only on one leg, but if you need more sacrifices from me, tell me\"", "INFO : Did the help your brother gave you include financial expenditures in the 5 figures? I cannot comprehend how else he would think you owe him $20K.", "NTA but reconsider cutting all ties based on one conversation. Is it worth losing your best friend? After things cool, have a conversation with him about why you can't financially help him. Tell him you hope he understands and that you don't want to damage the relationship over money.", "NTA\n\nYour brother wants you to just GIVE him $20k for a party.  That's outrageous.", "Your brother is an idiot.  Borrow 20k that you can't pay back for a wedding!?  Sounds like he needs a life lesson.  Help him out with the lesson, not the money.  NTA.", "People spend too much damned money on weddings.  They aren't what's important, and the $$ causes all kinds of strife like this.  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It is strange that he has been a good brother al this time and suddenly pulls this.  Is something else going on you are not aware of?", "NTA. Ehy\nIle he was a hood brother this is beyond crazy. Crazy amount of money, and crazy to ask you to pay for it. \n\nYou should always have a wedding you can afford.", "who the hell asks people out of the blue for $20k like it\u2019s on-hand? Lol NTA", "NTA, if he doesn\u2019t have the money for a big wedding, don\u2019t do anything big.! Immediate family could\u2019ve been okay! And to pay it all, yeah I would say no as well. Tell him to man up and pay for his own debt cause you didn\u2019t marry that woman, he did!", "Bro...no, NTA AT ALL.  Your brother can go fuck himself with a rusty dido.", "NTA.  \n\nIt's crazy how people view a retired (medically or otherwise) Veteran as a piggy bank to be raided for anything and everything.\n\nI  can't stress this enough, you are not the asshole here.", "NTA. He knew the costs going into it and instead of thinking to himself that someone (you) would bail him out he should\u2019ve curtailed his spending to something more manageable. I mean, if the had asked well before hand and had you plan it would you have gone to a $20K extent?", "NTA at all.  Your family sounds weirdly entitled and frankly insufferable. While it was great of your brother to be there for you when no one else was that by does not mean that you owe him $20,000 that he *chose* to spend.  Definitely go no contact with these people.", "NTA Not now, not ever. \"Hey, I've been good to you all of  these years, now give me more money than you have saved in your  life to pay for my wedding & all of the  personal choices  I made in the ceremony\". WTF? And your parents agreed... no doubt because they knew the collection  plate would be pushed their way if you refused. They all suck, don't feel guilty.", "Hold up....you're a single dad and you're disabled and your whole family thinks you should cover a 20k wedding for your brother to a woman you don't even like? What is wrong with them?! You are NTA, cut them all off and take care of you and your child.\nAnd thank you for your service.", "Your not the AH. And I agree with cutting off all ties with him. Not only did he want you to pay it back, he also threw back everything he did for you in your face. In my opinion, that\u2019s not something family should do. It was his Decision to have such a big wedding knowing all the consequences of it.", "Nta and I can\u2019t believe the nerve of him to demand that after the ceremony like who does that? You certainly aren\u2019t obligated to fork out 20k for someone else\u2019s wedding doesn\u2019t matter who they are and it\u2019s so cheeky that your brother would go ahead with all the plans even though he can\u2019t afford it to guilt trip you into paying", "I never understand people who want to spend what they don't have on a wedding. NTA", "NTA", "NTA You plan the wedding you can afford. If all you can afford is small ceremony and reception, that's what you plan. You don't go 20K into hock for a party and ask your brother to pay for it.\n\nIf you need a to take a break from you family for a while, by all means take a breather. You can decide how much, if any contact in the future when you've had time to think it over.", "NTA, if you don't have the money why on Earth are they insisting you pay it?", "NTA.  You certainly don\u2019t owe him and you can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have.  Curious if you asked him why he feels you should pay?", "Nta- people do (or should do) kind things because they want to, need to, like to. Not because they\u2019re stacking up \u201cpoints\u201d to cash in. Would it be nice for you to pay him back someway? Sure it would be. But asking you last minute to put your self in huge debt so he can have a lavish wedding (which is not a necessity) is insane. The fact your unsupportive parents agrees make me think you were always a backup plan just incase, or some one they could bum money off of incase he got rich/powerful. I say what you did was good. Your parents don\u2019t seem to respect or care for you at all and your brother showed his true hand, only helping you out for a return. He\u2019s either not gonna do shut for you anymore when you take him back or he\u2019s going to hound you any chance he can for something in return. You don\u2019t owe anyone kindness or money no matter what they do for you, unless you agreed upon it prior.", "NTA.  Come on.   He waits until after the wedding to ask.  He approaches you with your parents too?  So the three of them together decided you should pay.  Not he should take out a loan, not they should put a second mortgage on their house, not he should ask you waaaay before the wedding if you can contribute, not sorry honey we can\u2019t afford it.  No. He waits until afterwards and then expects you to cave.\n\nThis is utter crap.  Sure he supported you emotionally, and you can do likewise for him.  If he ever gets in a fight with his wife, he can come over for a beer with you.  When he gets a promotion at work, you two can go out to celebrate.  But this?  I supported you so give me cash now?  That isn\u2019t support. That\u2019s seeing a meal ticket.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t give him a penny, but if I did, I would want a written agreement that says if he ever pouts about the amount. or makes comments that it isn\u2019t enough he owes it all back to you.", "NTA . How the actual H\\*\\*l does this have anything to do with your Parents deciding how you spend YOUR money?\n\nI'm sorry but your Family is messed up if they all think YOU should pay for your Brother's Wedding !! If he can't afford to marry, then he is a major AH to think someone else will pay for for it.\n\nPlease don't feel guilty, you've already made a big sacrifice for your Country and you now have a LO to look after.", "This whole thing is batshit crazy.  NTA, not at all", "NTA- he seems like a good brother but i\u2019m baffled he would ask that of you. he is the one who made the conscious decision to have an expensive wedding that he could not afford. why should he expect you to foot the bill for his unwise decision? his wife is probably the reason why it was that expensive in the first place, the one you didn\u2019t approve of. don\u2019t feel bad about it, he put you in a tough position. why do you owe him $20k for him going to your bootcamp graduation?", "You\u2019re not the asshole, but I don\u2019t think you should completely cut ties with him. You should explain to him and your parents that that was an outrageous amount of money, and that you didn\u2019t even have it. If you were to cut anyone out, your parents would be OK but I don\u2019t think you should cut out your brother.", "Holy shit! Nta!! What on God's green earth? Did you get some kind of veterans pay out they were hoping to cash in on? That is outright insane.", "So he decided that you should pay for his wedding\u2026.and your parents agreed?\n\nI\u2019m missing something here, because this is incomprehensible behavior from people w/o brain tumors.\n\nNTA- if this is accurate, none of these people are worth having in your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
