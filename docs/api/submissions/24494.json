But asking you last minute to put your self in huge debt so he can have a lavish wedding (which is not a necessity) is insane.

No. He waits until afterwards and then expects you to cave.\n\nThis is utter crap.  Sure he supported you emotionally, and you can do likewise for him.

If you guys really had that kind of amazing friendship, and he always refused money talks, what brings him to bring up you giving him 20k?\n\nI'm not saying you should've stayed, leaving is fine because you felt hurt by the question and everything.  But if he really was as good to you as you said, shouldn't you maybe try and talk and figure out what's -really- going on?\n\nEven if it really is just a crushing debt weighing him down, maybe he just needs help figuring it out.  That doesn't have to be monetarily, but even just a fresh perspective on the debt.  Something to lighten the load emotionally.", "NTA. People assume that veterans with injuries such as yours have alot of money lying around which usually isn't the case.

You don't need to understand this--no one is ever going to, anyway. Just free yourself of knowing these thieves who want to parasite off you.

You saying you won't pay for it is not what will cause your relationship to break down. It's him making an incredibly unreasonable ask. It would be ridiculous for you to do that.\n\nETA: Just to be clear, my hypothetical scenario where he asked you ahead of time to help out is just me trying to think of how this situation could ever be not ridiculous.", "NTA, your brother decided to spend money he didn't have on a wedding but choose to anyway!", "NTA.

Where's the logic in that?", "NTA.... WTF\nIt's very presumptuous of your brother and family to think that you should pay for the wedding. You're a single Dad who has a physical disability. Why would your brother even think that, and better yet have a conversation with your parents and then they all agree?\n\nOkay yes I get it your brother has been there to help you but when a family is in crisis that's what you are suppose to do. (Ok so it doesn't always happen....ok anyhow) That doesn't mean you look for a payback. You help and do it out of love and concern to be sure the person is healthy mentally and physically.\n\nWhat he and your family is doing is wrong.

I can understand making a big debt you can't really afford for things out of your control or really bad luck or because of a necessity, but a wedding is nothing like it.
