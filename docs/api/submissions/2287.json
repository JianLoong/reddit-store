I still don't notice anything besides the tension this has caused. We're all Christians, but his mother is extremely superstitious, and my fiance believes everything she tells him.\n\n So tonight after my fiance got home from work, she told him that last night, she saw a tiny dragon fly by her window, and that therefore, the dragon statue brought the demon in and it needed to be thrown away. My fiance told me this and I told him that we can be rid of it when we give it to my mother. He told me no, it had to he thrown out, and if it was given to my mother then I would be responsible for anything that happened to her, and the sin would be on my hands. \n\nI told him that I don't believe that it is the dragon, and that it was a good thing repentance was a thing because if it started on my mother, she could throw it away and I can repent. But I'm not throwing it away, and if he did, there would be issues. He said that there would be issues, then. \n\nI told him if he's not going to stand up for me about a stupid dragon, then how can I trust that he will stand up for me later? He said that was ridiculous, and when I pointed out to him that hes not exactly showing me that I can trust him, he got really quiet and went to bed.\n\n I already have had to pass up the opportunity to safekeep my grandfather's collection of vinyl records because she believes that they somehow host demons, too, and a lot of them were irreplaceable, rare copies. I haven't been able to admit this to my grandpa, who asked me to keep them safe and make digital copies for him because he now lives with my uncle and is being cared for by my family, and he had to get rid of most of his belongings because there wasn't room for all his things.\n \nShould I just throw the dragon away just to keep the peace?

He and my grandmother were leasing two storage units full of their things. Grandma passed away from cancer in 2019 before I met my fiance. Us, my grandfather, and my cousins all cleaned out the smaller storage unit and we sorted through things we would keep and things we would throw away--mostly my grandmother's things. I got a lot of things--3 out of my grandma's 4 Christmas trees (she had 3 small ones and one large fiber optic one that my cousin wanted to have in exchange for me keeping the smaller ones), my favorite porcelain doll from my grandmother's collection, a hot chocolate machine, a chocolate candy maker set, some crafting materials, and her Christmas xylophonium.  My grandpa also gave us some of his camping gear he can't use anymore plus his weed eater. We own a jeep and stuffed that thing full and were originally going to come back foe the records and a box spring to replace our broken one. However when we told MIL about it, she said that we are not allowed to even bring the vinyls on the property--not even the shed. We decided if she was going to put her foot down it wasn't even worth it to go back. Grandpa stopped paying for that storage unit in July of 2021, so the vinyls have likely been auctioned off. I don't think I could ever forgive myself, my fiance, or my MIL for that one. \nHowever I should clarify that my grandpa did not tell me to take them.
