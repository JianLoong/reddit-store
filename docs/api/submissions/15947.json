All this over a 24 hours difference?", "NTA, but in your situation I would tell him to go ahead on the flight he chose and you can meet him later when your work schedule allows. Maybe that\u2019ll help the pieces click into place? My husband and I have to do this periodically bc like you, I have a strict coverage issue at work, and he is a business owner that absolutely forgot what it\u2019s like to be in an office environment with P&Ps to consider. So we do the best we can, but to avoid frustration for us both and sometimes that looks like me meeting him there. Hope that helps.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI swear, I don't understand people who can't understand what they're told the first time.  It seems as if he just flat out enjoyed getting you to the blow-your-top stage.", "NTA. Repeated disrespect makes most people lose their cool a bit.", "NTA. What\u2019s up with your husband? My wife was a school administrator and had limited windows of time where she could go on vacation. We simply planned around it. Yes, that usually meant paying more for flights, but that\u2019s the deal. Is he jealous or somehow seeking to undermine your career?", "NTA at all. Has your husband always had his head shoved up his ass like this, thinking only of himself and never of you?\n\nHas he always just ignored the realities and practicalities of your job for whatever suits him better to believe?\n\nI'm sort of wondering how long this has been going on. One of the first things you learn when you have a nurse in your life is that plans do not get to be made spontaneously nor can you can just randomly change dates.\n\nMarriage counselling may well be a good idea, because he just isn't listening to or regarding a single thing you say.", "NTA. My husband is an ER doctor and his July time-off requests were due this month, too, and we also have a trip planned in July. I know better than to even bother looking at any flights in June, that would just be dumb, as I know what his schedule is and when his requests were due. If your husband wanted a trip that started in June, he should have planned for that last month. If he didn\u2019t realize it, that sucks, but it doesn\u2019t mean that suddenly the normal guidelines of your work don\u2019t apply.", "NTA, his field might be more easy going compared to yours.\n\nBut still having one hour to leave work and go to a airport? Naah that's not reasonable in my opinion", "NTA. Gah what is with the button pushing. He needs to let it gooooooo or you\u2019ll be goooooooooone.", "You need to start doing something that really annoys him, and then renegotiate.   NTA", "NTA. He already knew that you couldn't leave on 6/30, and you only snapped at him after prolonged harping/repeated comments. TBH, it seems like he didn't take you seriously until you finally snapped at him - which is a serious issue that's 100% on him to fix, not you.", "NTA. At this point it's only partially about your work. The other factor here is that *you drew a line.* You said No very clearly and he ignored it. Many times. \n\nIt's disrespectful to you as a person. He needs to hear you when you say no. No June, no 4pm, no no no. It seems like he thinks that he can get around your No with enough pushing. Clearly, you being sweet and gentle about it wasn't going to make him stop. What else can you do but harden your No and snap at him?\n\nAnd of course he's cranky. He tried to push on something he thought would give under pressure, and instead he got bitten. Boo hoo, his actions had a consequence. Maybe next time he thinks about being selfish he'll remember the mild discomfort he's experiencing now.", "NTA.    What part  of \"I cannot  get June 30th off\" does he not understand?\n\nCall in sick day before  your vacation???  Don't do that, it just pisses off your coworkers.....especially if they can't cover your shift", "NTA. Your husband is being selfish, childish & disrespecting your career & the boundaries you very clearly set. Boo hoo if he has to wait a whole 12 extra hours to leave for vacation (ummm seriously why is this even an issue??!). Grow up, man.", "You're not the asshole. Your husband is the asshole for trying to just get what he wants and not caring about your job. You have expained it multiple times and it seems he isn't listening. Maybe it be better for him to just go on vacation by himself.", "NTA you should have kept your cool, but sounds like he was pushing it. Still, you should apologize for snapping at him, that was a little unhinged", "Yeah, my wife used to snap at me. Now she is my ex.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have commitments  and responsibilities you can\u2019t get out of. He sounds very immature. I\u2019d tell him to the the flight and you will meet him there if going on that particular flight is so important to him. Being nagged and repeatedly disrespected is exhausting so many a little separate time would not be a bad thing! I know I would be avoiding him if he continued with his childish antics.", "NTA- at all. Sorry, but is he three? Cannot remember information you told him already? He's not respecting your situation or feelings. C'mon. Not cool. You seem so stressed about it, too.", "NTA, it\u2019s a one day difference. he needs to just accept that you can\u2019t take off the extra day & leave it alone. you\u2019re planning your vacation around your career not the other way around!", "NTA\n\nNot sure how long you have been married or working for this particular employer, but hubby isn't listening. \n\nAdditionally, is it possible he already bought non-refundable tickets for 6/30? (I've got a spouse who would have done this as well;)\n\nI'd not bring it up again and just focus on the fun things you'll be doing starting July 1. \n\nHe'll adjust and move on. And hopefully never try this maneuver again.", "Being a nurse is hard enough without having to deal with this childish BS.  I know because I have 25+ years working as a registered nurse.  Give him the option of either leaving for your trip together as planned or he may leave a day early and pick you up at the airport the next day.  How long have you been with your husband?  NTA.", "NTA!", "NTA. Sorry to do the wild reddit speculation thing, but is it possible he resents your working? Does treating you like a goddess mean keeping you financially dependent on him?", "Oh hell f*ing NO! NTA - He truly doesn't give a Frick about your job or your work ethic. Not sure how long you have been married but you might need to think things over especially if this isn't the first time.", "You sound like me when people dont bloody listen and it really annoys the hell out of me too so I get why you would be pissed and he clearly isn't listening at all or respecting that. He slightly deserves your attitude when he's not listening or taking your job seriously. It's not hard to just arrange plans on the time you got off\n\nNta", "So let him be cranky. You certainly have had to feel upset enough at his behavior and he didn\u2019t mind offending you.", "12. 12 hours. 6p vs 6a.", "I would, but the trip from the airport to his parents' house is about 90 minutes. Coming back to pick me up would just irritate him even more.", "He actually treats me like a goddess- except when it comes to my career. With any other subject, my very whim is his command. For some reason, me working has been an issue for a couple of years... my schedule is never convenient, he doesn't think the admin values me enough, I work too hard... and on and on.", "Hell I need a full 24 hours to prepare myself tbh, one hour is nothing.", "No, she really shouldn't. If he can't figure out what being married to a nurse means after however long they've been married that's on him and she's quite right to be incredibly frustrated and snap.", "Second marriage for both of us. Together 6 yrs, married for 2. Both in our 40s. He's a retired Navy Chief, so it boggles my mind that he isn't understanding a career that dominates your whole life.", "He definitely would prefer if I was a stay at home cat mom, but there is no financial abuse. I have access to everything and can spend whatever I want. I just give him a heads up if it's over $100 so that he knows, since he pays all the bills. He has never held money against me. When he was finishing his degree a few years ago, I was the primary breadwinner and he remains grateful that I supported us so he could fo back to school. Now that he makes so much, he wants to make sure I feel cared for financially. I've been poor my whole life, so the financial freedom is still tough to get used to. He encourages me to spend money if I seem hesitant. I often joke that I am a trophy wife.\n\nI do think he resents anything that takes my time and attention away from him, though. He needs a lot of attention, lol, and is not shy about asking for it. I can do whatever I want, he just prefers if I let him tag along or chauffer me. I am well aware of how possessive that sounds, but it's more like the 5 year old who wants to go shopping with mommy than a jealous partner issue.", "Your SO is apparently a child, so I hope you're not having sex with him, as it's illegal to have sex with children.", "Wow, which is really like a 3 hour difference if you factor in sleep", "Then let him choose.\nGo as you want and drive 90m to pick me up the next day or wait and go with me like we planned.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYour bottom line is and will remain, that you cannot flex your schedule. Any choices he makes despite clearly knowing your situation is his problem.", "Why are you so scared to irritate him? Life has irritations. You're his *wife.*", "Oh, honey. That's a HUGE red flag, that you working is such an issue. Do you make more than him?", "And do you really love your job?", "Well, he\u2019s probably right about admin not valuing you and being overworked. (One of my good friends is a nurse.) And hey it would be great if people only got sick between 9-5 on weekdays. But that\u2019s the way it is.", "Can't imagine running from work to the airport, i need some me time after work to unwind and such.\n\nBut 24 hours atleast to make sure you have everything everything is ready things like that", "Just because someone is wrong or in this case - an asshole, doesn't mean the other party has the right to loose control of their emotions and belittle them. Taking ownership of that is the mature thing to do and a step towards making a bad situation better.", "I just spit my Jack and Diet Coke across the room! Thanks for the levity! I needed the laugh!", "I'm not scared to irritate him, I just prefer not to. I love him and want him to be happy. He's my happy place and we so rarely have conflict.", "Nope. I make about half what he makes. We don't need my income, which is probably why he is so dismissive of my job.", "I absolutely do. It's the best nursing job I've ever had. My coworkers are awesome. I am one of the most requested nurses by all the providers in the group, so I must also be good at what I do. I feel like I always have the opportunity to learn something and hone my skills. On top of that, I get to interact with children all day, so my heart gets very full.", "I dont mind doing that, but if the flight is at 6, I would need to leave by 4 to get to the airport by 5. I told him I can't leave work before 5. Over and over and over.", "No, in this case she absolutely did have that right. I don't know if you're being purposely dense like the husband, but nurses really do not have that flexibility. She CANNOT leave on 30/6. She has TOLD HIM THIS multiple times. So the fact that he KEEPS COMING BACK TO IT puts him beyond asshole territory. She should not have to apologise for that snap.", "Cool, but marriage will have conflicts. As long as you stand your ground on what's important to you. You sound overnice, but I don't actually know you so... Anyway, so take an Uber when you arrive. Problem solved!", "But you're a *nurse*, does he even understand how skilled you are and how important your work is? Ugh.", "OMG are you married to my husband? I do informatics now but always when I was nursing it was I work too hard, why can\u2019t I just drop everything and leave on time, it\u2019s never convenient, he was always very dismissive of my job.", "I suspect - and this is just a guess based on your comment that he treats you well in most areas but is very negative about numerous aspects of your job\u2014a job you love\u2014that he's jealous of how much you love your job, or uncomfortable w/some other aspect of it.", "Great! You say that he treats you like a goddess. Explain to him what your work means to you-- much like you did to me here-- (no matter how annoying your boss might be to him) and tell him that you need him to treat your work just   like a goddess. Tell him it's an extension of yourself, even with its irritations, because it brings you happiness, fulfillment and joy. Tell him that it makes you blossom into the person that you are--- that he loves so much. Tell him he needs to respect it. Tell him not to forget that tomorrow, either, lol\n\nAlso, tell him what you told me about him being your happy place. Tell him that conflict between you upsets you and you need for him to continue being your happy place. Like *really* stress it. And if he continues baiting you on subjects you've already talked to him about, then you know he's trying to instigate conflict. And that's *not* a happy place.", "NTA. Your husband is being really unfair to you by disrespecting what you have told him around your availability.", "Good thing you stand your ground honestly", "Well, I live in a world in which generally partners love each other and regret hurting each other. Getting snapped at hurts, even when it's understandable and you deserved it.", "You are probably right. He likes having my full attention and my job takes up too much of my time and energy. In hindsight, he probably felt like I was prioritizing my job over our time together. I kinda am, so I can't really fix that. He's just going to have to deal with it.", "Oof, NTA, if he's jealous of your job being important to you, that's a huge red flag. Does he show signs of codependency or control in any other areas? Does treating you as a goddess ever involve doing things for you that you didn't ask for and expecting you to be grateful?"]}
