In hers, if a person needs something that you have, you give it to them. I mine if you need something you get a job, get paid, and buy what you need. \n\nWhile I earn most of our income, my wife runs a dayhome, takes care of our kids, and the house. We take our money and pay our bills, put some away for emergencies, our retirement, kids education, etc. We also keep an account for traveling to visit her family or paying for her mom and dad to visit us. \n\nMy wife has given away a bunch of my stuff because her family needed it. She gave my trekking backpack to one of her cousins because he needed a backpack. She could have bought him a $30 Costco backpack instead of giving away my $400 backpack, which he promptly got stolen. \n\nThe last straw was my laptop. I was away for the weekend at a friend's wedding that she did not want to attend. Her auntie was visiting and said that my wife's brother needed a computer for schoolwork. Since all I ever did was play games on it she gave it to her brother for university. I tried to get it back. She said it would be rude. I explained that the only reason all she saw me do with it was \"play games\" that was because I was home. When I leave in the morning and take it with me it is to go earn money doing a job I am paid for. \n\nShe said I didn't have to talk to her like she is dumb. But she refused to ask for it back. \n\nI replaced it with money from the travel fund. Which means that we will not be seeing her parents this Christmas. \n\nShe is pissed. She said that I took money that belonged to both of us to buy myself something. I asked her here the money should come from. Should I take it out of our retirement? Our kids education? Does she want to out off replacing the furnace with winter almost here. I said I could cancel that if she wanted. \n\nShe said that I could have just put it on the credit card. I asked her to explain where the money to PAY the credit card would come from. \n\nShe thinks I'm treating her like an idiot. I think she needs to stop giving my things away.", "created_utc": 1697644857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17au81b/aita_for_replacing_any_property_of_mine_that_my/", "score": 3068, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But as soon as it affects her suddenly its a big deal?     \nI would be spitting blood if someone gave away my computer! Aside from the value and inconvenience what about the lost data, files, photos? The stored financial data? Stored passwords? I'd have driven round there and demanded it back!", "NTA - your wife is being ridiculous, hopefully not being able to see her parents will be the wake up call she needs.\n\nBTW, you need a firm, hard boundary: she is to NEVER give away anything of yours without your explicit permission.  Let her use you as the heavy if necessary, but she cannot give your stuff away without your permission.\n\nWhat if your laptop contained important work information that had no other backup.  Does  she want your to be fired?", "NTA Your wife needs to stop giving away your things to family and friends. If she wants to give her stuff away, fine and fair, but she has no business being \"generous\" with other people's belongings. She created this problem, she can fix it by stopping what she's doing. Until then, you will continue to replace these items that go missing by her hand thru the only discretionary spending account you have.", "Your wife is an idiot. Your stuff is not hers to give away. You should have made her get your laptop back. Make her get a better job and use her own money, and give away her own stuff. You need to set hard boundaries with her.

We now live in different countries.\n\nNTA.\n\nPeople like that don't see it as a character flaw, after all, it's not their stuff, so they don't see the theft as their responsibility.", "Your wife needs a class on finances. She really doesn't understand money if her \"solution\" is to take on debt to replace stuff she didn't have to give away. She needs to understand that when she gives away money, she's trading years of *your life* for her family's comfort. Years *you* will have to work in your 60s, as an old man, so her family doesn't have to work right now.  She needs to see what $10,000 looks like when given away vs invested for 20 years.  \n\nAnd you both need couples therapy for communication.  You are NTA, she is, but things won't improve with some education for both of you.", "NTA\n\nThe real solution is to sell off her property until you recoup the costs of her generosity. But given her ideas about credit cards being free money, I\u2019d say you have a bigger financial issue in your marriage.\n\nPersonal property is the property of the individual owner, it\u2019s not joint marital property just because you\u2019re married. She needs to learn the difference. Maybe offer to return the new laptop if she gets yours back before you cannot return it?", "NTA - you have expressed previously that this is not okay. Discuss it and explain she may not give away your things without your explicit prior permission. You need to respect her culture but she needs to respect yours as well. \n\nHer family may pressure her about this. I think that being very direct with them explaining the reason she cannot visit is that she gave away something that should not have been given away and you had to pay to replace it. She is embarrassed to bring it up, I\u2019m sure but they need to understand that pressuring her for things has consequences to them as well. \n\nI would perhaps go to counseling yo somebody aware of her culture to build some mutual understanding as this seems like a huge divide.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nShe is stealing from you. Wives can absolutely steal from their husband's. It has no value to her, so in her head, she can give it away.

I don\u2019t care if there\u2019s a cultural difference or not, you don\u2019t just give away something that belongs to someone else, with or without asking. That\u2019s just a respect thing.

You're not treating her like an idiot - you have valid arguments, etc. - but she sure is acting like one.  This has got to STOP.  She gave away the laptop you use for work!  Enough already!", "NTA.

You need to sit her down and explain to her that it is *illegal* to take something that she does not own and give it to someone else.

If she wants to give shit away she better make sure it\u2019s hers to give. You are absolutely doing the right thing by taking it out of something that she alone needs.

And you two need to see eye to eye whenever this stuff comes up. \n\n\n\nWhat about giving her a personal account where she can save precisely for that? She has a job. \n\n\n\nAlso, she needs to learn to manage money and finances better, and she must learn that when either mutual or someone else's funds/stuff is involved, she can't unilaterally decide. Same as you. You can't decide to take the funds from the account. \n\n\n\nShe also needs to learn that family is important to an extreme. But your partner is the most important of all,  that's your new family. She needs to learn to be diplomatic whenever her relatives ask for help and then talk to you, suggest alternatives, and the like. \n\n\n\nFinally, I'd ask for the computer back myself. Say that this is the last time she gives something of yours away. It should have ended with the backpack, to be honest. \n\n\n\nYou respect her stuff. She needs to respect yours.

The security risk alone of having work and personal documents (like tax returns and social security statements) at risk for identity theft would make me incandescently angry. NTA.

I don't want to jump to conclusions but she could have a drug problem", "NTA and I imagine her family members would be embarrassed to accept anything if they knew you didn't want her to give it away.\n\nI hate to use the phrase teach her a lesson, but in this particular case I think it was necessary, and she has to learn that you don't have unlimited money to give stuff away like this.", "What culture would this be? It would be a complete shambles if everyone gave someone else\u2019s stuff away.

JFC I'd divorce over that.  She needs to stop giving your things away.  If anything you're under reacting.\n\nEdit.  Also I'd point out to her family what's going on and that it's unacceptable and asking them not to accept your possessions without checking.", "NTA but to your knowledge, does your wife have basic money sense? Like does she work? Does she understand credit or anything like that?\n\nI\u2019m just shocked that she would give away a work-trailed laptop and not connect that you need it for work. Or that you need to use money to pay credit cards off.", "You are treating her like an idiot.

Once you do that, people will stop accepting your stuff from your wife.", "This is a lesson that\u2019s going to be hard learned by your wife. NTA.

There's no way around it and sugar coating it is just useless.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like your wife is very loving towards you, otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t feel so compelled to gift your shit away. Do to her what she has done to you so she\u2019ll see how it feels and move accordingly.", "NTA but getting her to change is going to be difficult unless she can stand up to her family. Have you tried turning the tables on them by saying you need so and so when you're at their place?

SIL is showing off something, wife was saying the other day she needed one as well!!!", "Nta", "NTA \n\nSuggest to her that she sell her own stuff to make up the money difference.

You need to lock up all your items. NTA", "She is an idiot though which is why you have to talk to her like a 5 year old.  Absolutely nta.  Make sure you take the backpack money too though and not just the laptop money", "NTA. \n\nYour wife doesn't understand the value or use of very basic items, nor does she understand how money works. You aren't treating her any certain way, you are simply replacing what she is giving away using money. There isn't another way to get a computer besides money, and putting it on a credit card is still money. \n\nI don't know how you can get through to her, but if she still doesn't understand that giving away a computer that you use daily for work needs to be replaced using MONEY, I'm not sure you can. So I suggest having a new conversation about finances. I'd tell her straight up that anything she gives away will be replaced using that money, and just as she buys things that are for HER, you can buy things that are for you. You don't give away her stuff, so she can't give away yours. If she can't grasp that, then you need to separate your finances- bills are covered first, then you each keep a percentage of your paychecks/you give her a bit from yours to buy your own items, and X, Y, Z is for savings and other shared expenses. Then you each have your own money and your own stuff. \n\nGood luck, because trying to explain the concept of money to an adult feels like an impossible challenge.", "Info:  Does she ever give away her own expensive items, or just yours?", "NTA\n\nYou are right, be relentless with her.", "NTA but it sounds like you guys (she) needs counseling. \nSomething isn't clicking in her head that she's missing the impact of her generosity. I wonder if rather than just generosity it's keeping up appearances (showing her success). Either way, this won't go away on its own.", "NTA. Neither of those things were hers to give. She gave away your work laptop! I hope there wasn't anything confidential on that thing.", "NTA. Helping is one thing. Stealing is another. If she's giving it away without your permission,  it's stealing. And believe  it when I say her family now sees y'all as easy targets for the scam. They come to your place when you're not there to go shopping.", "Nta the reason she thinks you\u2019re treating her like an idiot is because she IS an idiot\u2026.who the hell just gives shit away?? at least her dumbass actions have some repercussions", "NTA.

Nuclear option I know", "Well, if your wife won't ask for the computer back, can't you just go to the auntie's house and tell her how much you NEED a computer?  Apparently the rule is she has to give you one!!  (kidding.  using the vacation fund to pay for a new computer seems pretty reasonable. NTA)", "She doesn\u2019t want to be treated like an idiot but let\u2019s be honest, she\u2019s acting like an idiot!  Like you should just be able to pluck money off the money tree to pay for a new laptop.  The fact that you made it clear that you don\u2019t want her giving away your things should have stopped it but she obviously won\u2019t change unless there\u2019s a consequence she doesn\u2019t like, such as delaying your vacation.

The two items you specifically mention are an expensive trekking backpack and now your laptop. Both items she may have perceived as things you used to take time/divide your attention from her & your family. \n\nSo I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s more deliberate than just, oh, someone needed it?  Just a thought. If that\u2019s the case, then you guys will have some work to do in counseling.", "Is she only giving away YOUR stuff or does she give hers away too?", "[removed]", "NTA, your wife is an idiot.

The computer blows my mind, I have so many confidential things on my computer I would be livid if someone gave it away.", "NTA. \n\nI would be furious, she gave your laptop away when you didn't have a chance to either backup important files or clear any sensitive information. I realize Auntie may not be able to get through your login to access anything, but it still seems like a big risk. I would absolutely insist on getting it back to do a factory reset. \n\nAnd you need to have a sit down where you tell her that she absolutely has to stop stealing from you. It's just ridiculous, she's literally stealing your property so she can be the hero to her family. She is treating you with so much disrespect. \n\nThis is really so much bigger than just the items. If my spouse was treating me with so much contempt and being so manipulative, I'd be having serious thoughts. Good luck.", "NTA.  But a lock for your closet.

In hers, if a person needs something that you have, you give it to them. I mine if you need something you get a job, get paid, and buy what you need. \n\nWhile I earn most of our income, my wife runs a dayhome, takes care of our kids, and the house. We take our money and pay our bills, put some away for emergencies, our retirement, kids education, etc. We also keep an account for traveling to visit her family or paying for her mom and dad to visit us. \n\nMy wife has given away a bunch of my stuff because her family needed it. She gave my trekking backpack to one of her cousins because he needed a backpack. She could have bought him a $30 Costco backpack instead of giving away my $400 backpack, which he promptly got stolen. \n\nThe last straw was my laptop. I was away for the weekend at a friend's wedding that she did not want to attend. Her auntie was visiting and said that my wife's brother needed a computer for schoolwork. Since all I ever did was play games on it she gave it to her brother for university. I tried to get it back. She said it would be rude. I explained that the only reason all she saw me do with it was \"play games\" that was because I was home. When I leave in the morning and take it with me it is to go earn money doing a job I am paid for. \n\nShe said I didn't have to talk to her like she is dumb. But she refused to ask for it back. \n\nI replaced it with money from the travel fund. Which means that we will not be seeing her parents this Christmas. \n\nShe is pissed. She said that I took money that belonged to both of us to buy myself something. I asked her here the money should come from. Should I take it out of our retirement? Our kids education? Does she want to out off replacing the furnace with winter almost here. I said I could cancel that if she wanted. \n\nShe said that I could have just put it on the credit card. I asked her to explain where the money to PAY the credit card would come from. \n\nShe thinks I'm treating her like an idiot. I think she needs to stop giving my things away.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I will also add that Chinese people aren't stupidly generous or anything - we only give these things away when they don't have any particular value or meaning to us, so don't feel bad when someone gives it to you when you appreciate it more than they do.  I once gave my mom my cheap netbook years ago while she was visiting me because she thought it was the cutest computer that she had ever seen and she had just retired her own old computer and could use another one - the act cost almost nothing to me but meant everything to her.", "I would say I'm not giving anything away but rather helping people in need.

But OP is not us, different people have different points if view, and sometimes time and complacency contribute to lack of good judgment.\n\nI just suggested OP take this as an opportunity to start a dialogue. You made your point, you believe your solution can work long term, I disagreed and offered reasons why I suggested a dialogue is in place and how couples suffer from miscommunication after the passing of time.\n\nAll you're doing is just telling me why YOU can't imagine being with someone like that without addressing anything that I said before. So with the limited I formation we have are you suggesting he leave her? Or continue to \"punish\" her by taking money from the travel fund?\n\nI'm confused as to what you're trying to achieve by continuing this train if thought, I mean I am all for discussion and a free exchange of ideas where we can see if we understand each other, find a solution and be better for it but all I am reading is you telling me how irresponsible and financially illiterate another person is with no sense of positive resolution in place.", "Actually we don't know point #2. That's a inference. Those family members might have absolutely no clue that these items were taken without consent.", "I think what u/RandomGuy_81 means is to talk to her and say clearly:  \u201cI need the laptop for work and will have to replace it.  If you won\u2019t ask brother to give it back, I will need to take money from the travel fund to replace it.

That was the discussion portion of it.", "The same way that she talked to him before giving away his computer? Why is it that he has to follow rules but she doesn\u2019t?", "He did talk to her.

She said to go into credit card debt. Using money from a holiday fund makes more sense than going into debt.", "He did talk. She wouldn\u2019t ask for the laptop back.

I agreed and went into the store to buy my groceries and something for them. And then when I was at checkout I looked behind me and lo and behold, the woman that was with the guy that asked me for help was standing there with cheap booze in her hand.

Just give her stuff to HIS family. It stays in the family right?

How on earth is that disrespectful but essentially stealing his laptop isn't??", "They bought you a home? Ya well nevermind lol", "[deleted]", "Did she talk to him before giving away his stuff?  I think she established precedent."]}
