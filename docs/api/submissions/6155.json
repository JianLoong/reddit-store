{"id": 6155, "submission_id": "1008uc3", "title": "AITA for leaving home early after my stepmom cut me out of family pictures?", "selftext": "I (26f) decided to visit my dad this weekend for New Years, he was having some of my extended family over and I did not visit during Christmas so it seemed like a good time to go. A few hours after I arrived my ex stepmother dropped by and said she had a gift for me. She handed me an envelope and inside were a bunch of cut out pictures of my face. She had decided to go to my dads (she has a key still) and get some of the family photos and then cut me out of some of them. I looked at my dad because I had no idea what to say or what was going on and he just sat there laughing it off. My exstepmom then told me that she thought I could use these for my scrapbook (i have not had a scrapbook since I was 12). They didn\u2019t really explain anything after that and dropped it. \nThis is not the first time it has happened, there were pictures in the past you could tell I was cropped out of when she would edit them before getting them printed. I would remember taking pictures on family vacations and then when she showed us what she printed I wouldn\u2019t be in any of them or just my shoulder or a peice of hair could be seen. I have never said anything when she did this in the past as it was her camera and she was paying for the prints so I knew I didn\u2019t have a say in it and would bring my own camera instead.  \nBut this time she went through the few family pictures that I am in from events, vacations and even the professional ones she forced us to go to get done and cut me out. \nThey have been divorced for a while and she is engaged currently so I don\u2019t know what sparked this. She also suffers from depression so I\u2019m not sure if she was having a hard time or something happened that caused this. No one has said much about it. \nI stayed for a few hours and then called my bf and asked if he could pick me up because I felt weird about the situation. I didn\u2019t say goodbye because I didn\u2019t want them to ask me to stay or cause a fight and I really didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \nBut now I\u2019m getting texts from my family upset that I shouldn\u2019t have left and I\u2019m overreacting it\u2019s not a big deal because it wasn\u2019t all of the pictures just some of them and some were duplicates that we didn\u2019t use anyway. My dad is upset because my sisters are disappointed that they didn\u2019t get to see me much before I left and I didn\u2019t say goodbye to them. \n\nAITA for not staying to see family after my stepmom gave me an envelope full of pieces of my face cut out from family pictures?\n\nEdit: for those asking is there is more to the situation or what I did to her to make her upset, we have always had a rocky relationship. After she married my dad when I was 9 she desperately wanted me to call her \u201cmom\u201d and wanted me to spend Mother\u2019s Day with her. I have a mother and told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and had to spend the time with my mother knowing my mom would be hurt if I did these things. My mom was already not thrilled that my dad was remarried and did make the relationship btw my stepmom and I harder. After that my stepmom seemed hurt and over the years has done things to make me feel excluded or just prioritized her daughters and her family over mine. It\u2019s a really complicated relationship but I have never been the type of kid that screams or gets upset or anything I am shy and introverted and I hate confrontation so I have never called her out for anything but usually just try to talk to my dad about it. I do try to be nice as she\u2019s my sisters mom and I try to keep the peace but this was too much to ignore this time so I left.", "created_utc": 1672536794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1008uc3/aita_for_leaving_home_early_after_my_stepmom_cut/", "score": 1835, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry.", "What a psychopathic show of dominance.", "Your ex step mom cut you out of photos, handed you the heads she cut out and all your father did is laugh, sorry your step mom needs psychiatric help and for you father to laugh and not stick up for you makes him an ah. For those saying to you it's not a big deal, it is and it's very upsetting for you, they are ahs. The only one not an ah is you. Your family need to think exactly how they'd feel if they were in your position and not one person told your ex step mom she is a lunatic and force her out if the house. I'd go no to very low contact with them all.", "Baffling shit. NTA, she sounds like a psycho. My petty self would either return the favor or hot glue my faces onto something expensive of hers.", "NTA. This isn't her depression. This is a personality disorder or some weird kind of competitiveness.", "Well you say she suffers from depression so maybe that explains it bcuz she doesn\u2019t sound well on the head, I personally wouldn\u2019t attend any events she\u2019s at anymore because frankly it sounds bizarre and more than a little creepy. NTA.", "NTA.  WTF?  Why did your dad not stop this?  Why does an ex-stepmother still have a key?  It isn\u2019t difficult to change the locks.  And why is your family acting like you did something wrong when you left after such an insulting and ridiculous situation. \n\n I\u2019m sorry.  It sounds like your family has some serious dysfunction if this seems normal to any of them.", "I so much want to take some of your family photos and PhotoShop in Cruella de Ville in over your ex stepmom's face in them. The woman is batshit crazy.", "Your ex-stepmother sounds unhinged and mental. What would prompt someone to do something so strange and cruel? And your family thinks you should forgive her? Why on earth would you do that? NTA, I say forget all of them.", "NTA. She has issues, but depression isn't what causes this.", "NTA and I\u2019m outraged on your behalf, OP. And don\u2019t give her sock because she\u2019s sometimes has depression. Being depressed does not justify being nasty.", "NTA.  I think what she did sucks and can see why you left.  I think it might have been nice if you had said goodbye but that's a call I am not going judge as I wasn't there.\n\nThe one thing that does make me wonder is why does the ex-stepmom still have a key to dad's place?\n\nAt this point, I am wondering why you are still in contact with your father's ex?", "AND the woman still has a key to the house!!!!

I thought the Allies dismantled it properly.", "bot account", "NTA for OP\n\n(NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA)\n\n*Alarmed\\_Jellyfish555* ,  your last paragraph sums it up perfectly. The fact that ex Mc Nastystepmum (Ex-McN) had been allowed to keep her keys to her father's house is ridiculous. OP probably has many similar incidents to talk about while she was growing up with this vile woman, if this is how she treats OP in public.\n\nAnd then laughing when Ex-McN shows up & gifts the cut out heads of OP to her for scrapbooking (which OP hasn't done since she was a child- poor attempt at normalising Ex-McN!)  shows how weak OP's father is & how little he thinks of OP.  It's heartbreaking to see this done to OP.\n\n***OP, none of this is normal or acceptable behaviour even to a stranger let alone a daughter!*** You have every right to cut off relations and go NC/LC, if you wish, it's ok to keep yourself safe from such people.", "Oh just read the stepparents sub. There are a lot of nasty stepparents on there. They view the child as a physical manifestation of their spouses past relationship. Instead of just not dating a parent, they take their jealousy and anger out on the minor kid that can\u2019t help who their parents are. I use that sub frequently (with another account) and my comments get removed if I even hint at a criticism towards a stepparent. Stepparents get a bad rep for a reason - which sucks for me because Im a damn good stepmom.", "I love this. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude04", "NTA! NTA!

I don\u2019t know how long she was your stepmom or what your relationship with her was like for that time. If it wasn\u2019t actively awful (since you don\u2019t say she was a witch from the beginning), then is there any chance she actually thought she was doing something nice, but misguided? Like, did she remember \u201cOP used to like to scrapbook, maybe I can collect some pictures for her use in her scrapbook\u201d and her depression/oddness just didn\u2019t click with her that it would come across hateful? Just, the way she made a point to come over and say \u201cI have a gift for you\u201d doesn\u2019t completely track with most of the jealous/hateful stepparents we read about here.\n\nIf you think there\u2019s even a chance she didn\u2019t mean it as awful as it came across, it might be worth a short conversation to let her know. \u201cHey, stepmom, I didn\u2019t say anything the other day because I was too stunned, but I want you to know that it\u2019s really hurtful that you would cut me out of all the family pictures. It feels like you don\u2019t want me to be in the family, which is extra weird since you and Dad are divorced and you\u2019re engaged to someone else.\u201d Maybe she\u2019s just in a really weird place, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be able to tell her how she made you feel. And if she WAS trying to be hateful, you\u2019ll be no worse off than you are now, and you can go LC or NC at that point.", "NTA what your ex stepmother did was psychotic and the fact this wasn't a family blow up to defend you, was your cue to leave. No one at that gathering cared about you or your feelings, so why be there?", "How would these family members feel if they were \"gifted\" envelopes full of their faces that had been removed from pictures?!?! Very bizarre. NTA", "NTA.  This is just weird.  If I were you, and this is me being petty AF, scatter all the heads on a table, take a picture, and then post it on fb with an explanation that this was given to you by your ex-stepmother in front of your family, who claim it is no big deal and are telling you to get over it.  Ask the fb world what they think.  Tag your dad and any family members calling you an asshole, with a note so others know that they think you are overreacting.  Getting apologies start coming in, along with pleas to take the post down.\nEdited to add any of ex-stepmoms new family will also see this and see how psycho she is, so make sure to put in context of her cutting and editing you out of pictures during the whole relationship", "So this psycho lady heaps mental abuse on you for years,and when she tries doing it again when you're an adult,they made at you?\nYeah, NTA. But your \"family\" clearly are", "NTA! Why is everybody getting at you about it, and not at your very unpleasant-sounding father and ex-stepmother?", "I don't think anyone is an asshole.

Seriously, what the Kentucky fried fuck.", "nta. has your father always been this much of a weakling though?", "I\u2019m not sure you need to be around either of them much.

The gathering where OP\u2019s dad laughed and did nothing when he knew about this strange and malicious act toward his daughter.\nEx stepmother is fucking unhinged. Dad is an apathetic pig. And OP is NTA.", "She still has a key because after the divorce she and my dad had thought it would be best if they both had access to each others house in case the girls left anything behind. She stays in contact with me usually she will text me or call me every few months (she only stated doing this after I moved out and didn\u2019t visit as often) I usually don\u2019t talk to her if I don\u2019t have to and I thought after the divorce I would never have to but she seems to think that because they were married for 11 years that she still gets to be a part of my dads family. She gets really upset when some of my family members like, my dads brothers family, refuse to talk to her. She\u2019s told me that she wishes everyone would treat her the same as when they were married. It\u2019s a really odd situation that I\u2019ve been trying to avoid which has made her much happier now that I don\u2019t go as often but her happiness makes her also reach out to me and tell me she\u2019s so happy I moved out and made it on my own.

The times he has tried to talk to her she has run away or locked him out. Like once I overcooked the entire carton of eggs because my dad wouldn\u2019t get up to make breakfast (I was 10/11) and she saw I wasted the eggs and ran away for 3 days and would call him screaming at him for not being on her side. And then after that point I wasn\u2019t allowed any friends at the house because this happened during a sleepover I had with one of my friends, I was just trying to make us both breakfast since dad wouldn\u2019t get up and we had an egg maker so it wasn\u2019t unsafe.", "*Lots* of people live with depression without being totally fucking evil.", "I\u2019d want to punch dad in the face", "Well I\u2019ll tell you this.
