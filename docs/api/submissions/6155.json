A few hours after I arrived my ex stepmother dropped by and said she had a gift for me. She handed me an envelope and inside were a bunch of cut out pictures of my face. She had decided to go to my dads (she has a key still) and get some of the family photos and then cut me out of some of them. I looked at my dad because I had no idea what to say or what was going on and he just sat there laughing it off. My exstepmom then told me that she thought I could use these for my scrapbook (i have not had a scrapbook since I was 12). They didn\u2019t really explain anything after that and dropped it. \nThis is not the first time it has happened, there were pictures in the past you could tell I was cropped out of when she would edit them before getting them printed. I would remember taking pictures on family vacations and then when she showed us what she printed I wouldn\u2019t be in any of them or just my shoulder or a peice of hair could be seen. I have never said anything when she did this in the past as it was her camera and she was paying for the prints so I knew I didn\u2019t have a say in it and would bring my own camera instead.  \nBut this time she went through the few family pictures that I am in from events, vacations and even the professional ones she forced us to go to get done and cut me out. \nThey have been divorced for a while and she is engaged currently so I don\u2019t know what sparked this. She also suffers from depression so I\u2019m not sure if she was having a hard time or something happened that caused this. No one has said much about it. \nI stayed for a few hours and then called my bf and asked if he could pick me up because I felt weird about the situation. I didn\u2019t say goodbye because I didn\u2019t want them to ask me to stay or cause a fight and I really didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \nBut now I\u2019m getting texts from my family upset that I shouldn\u2019t have left and I\u2019m overreacting it\u2019s not a big deal because it wasn\u2019t all of the pictures just some of them and some were duplicates that we didn\u2019t use anyway. My dad is upset because my sisters are disappointed that they didn\u2019t get to see me much before I left and I didn\u2019t say goodbye to them. \n\nAITA for not staying to see family after my stepmom gave me an envelope full of pieces of my face cut out from family pictures?", "created_utc": 1672536794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1008uc3/aita_for_leaving_home_early_after_my_stepmom_cut/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely NTA this is twisted and idgaf about her depression. To cut you out of any pictures is sick but then to collect the cutouts and give them to you is absolutely insane.
