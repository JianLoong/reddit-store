I have never liked Sarah. In my opinion she is extremely manipulative and controlling of Mike. We've had many disagreements in the past but this was the last straw for me.\n\nMike and Sarah got married at the courthouse and a few months after that, I proposed to Macy. Originally we weren't going to have a wedding but Macy decided she wanted the memories with both our families. Of course Mike was going to be on my side and Macy considered putting Sarah on hers.\n\nWe went out to eat with a friend of ours one night and the topic of the wedding came up. He told us that Sarah was furious when we decided to have a wedding because it made her look bad and they had gotten married first. Our friend didn't want to be in any arguments with them so I didn't confront Mike or Sarah about it. \n\nWhen I asked Mike to be in the wedding he said yes and asked about Sarah. I told him she wouldn't be in it because Macy was putting her two sisters and 2 childhood best friends. When he told Sarah this, it apparently sent her into a maniacal rage, anxiety attack, emergency therapy appointment, and loss of sleep. She then shows up at our house and has a come apart. Some of the things Sarah said include: why would I even want to come to your wedding?, I told my other friends and Mike's parents and they don't like the way you're treating me, I had to pay extra for an emergency therapy session because of this, I don't know why I\u2019m the one left out, you're doing this on purpose, if Mike is in it then I should be in it, and other hateful comments. She also said she didn't like the fact that Mike would be walking another woman down the isle and she should get to walk with her husband.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of that I couldn't bite my tongue anymore. I told her this wedding isn't about you, to quit playing woe is me, and her behavior was way out of line. She said that she's being left out so what does it matter. She leaves and I get a call from Mike saying \"my wife is being mistreated here and you know she's upset how could you say that?\u201d Later he calls and says she doesn\u2019t want him around me, he shouldn\u2019t be in the wedding party, and to call him in a month. \n\nThey both came back the next day to talk and seemed more understanding. Mike apologized and asked if he could still be in the wedding and I said yes.\nSarah is still invited just not in the wedding party.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692270017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tk4ee/aita_for_not_putting_my_best_friends_wife_in_the/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
