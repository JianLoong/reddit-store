I have never liked Sarah. In my opinion she is extremely manipulative and controlling of Mike. We've had many disagreements in the past but this was the last straw for me.\n\nMike and Sarah got married at the courthouse and a few months after that, I proposed to Macy. Originally we weren't going to have a wedding but Macy decided she wanted the memories with both our families. Of course Mike was going to be on my side and Macy considered putting Sarah on hers.\n\nWe went out to eat with a friend of ours one night and the topic of the wedding came up. He told us that Sarah was furious when we decided to have a wedding because it made her look bad and they had gotten married first. Our friend didn't want to be in any arguments with them so I didn't confront Mike or Sarah about it. \n\nWhen I asked Mike to be in the wedding he said yes and asked about Sarah. I told him she wouldn't be in it because Macy was putting her two sisters and 2 childhood best friends. When he told Sarah this, it apparently sent her into a maniacal rage, anxiety attack, emergency therapy appointment, and loss of sleep. She then shows up at our house and has a come apart. Some of the things Sarah said include: why would I even want to come to your wedding?, I told my other friends and Mike's parents and they don't like the way you're treating me, I had to pay extra for an emergency therapy session because of this, I don't know why I\u2019m the one left out, you're doing this on purpose, if Mike is in it then I should be in it, and other hateful comments. She also said she didn't like the fact that Mike would be walking another woman down the isle and she should get to walk with her husband.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of that I couldn't bite my tongue anymore. I told her this wedding isn't about you, to quit playing woe is me, and her behavior was way out of line. She said that she's being left out so what does it matter. She leaves and I get a call from Mike saying \"my wife is being mistreated here and you know she's upset how could you say that?\u201d Later he calls and says she doesn\u2019t want him around me, he shouldn\u2019t be in the wedding party, and to call him in a month. \n\nThey both came back the next day to talk and seemed more understanding. Mike apologized and asked if he could still be in the wedding and I said yes.\nSarah is still invited just not in the wedding party.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692270017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tk4ee/aita_for_not_putting_my_best_friends_wife_in_the/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That girl might be up to something.", "NTA Sarah sounds like a petty and selfish person, not someone I would want in my wedding either.", "NTA - it would be best for everyone if Sarah did not attend", "NTA. Sara appears to have mental health issues related to emotional regulation. They came back later to apologize, and all is well. You handled it well.", "At the end it sounds like Mike found his balls and said something to Sarah fuckin finally lol.", "NTA but honestly why do you even still want to be around Mike. He has no spine when it comes to his wife.", "NTA-Sarah sounds unhinged.  Make sure someone is on point to control her.", "NTA, but it may be time to tell Mike that until his wife has her shit under control, you can't be a part of his life, because that makes her a part of yours. Her behavior is overblown and unhinged, is in no way normal or acceptable, and it's now negatively affecting you and your wife-to-be  in ways it never should. You love him, you're there if he really needs you, but you need distance from her. And unfortunately, that means from him.", "NTA but uh this is insane and why is Sarah still invited??", "No, you don\u2019t need ushers for Sarah.  You need security.\n\nNTA", "100% this!", "NTA and several people have already mentioned it, but you need to have someone at your wedding who takes on the responsibility of keeping an eye on Sarah and short circuiting anything she might do to disrupt your wedding.\n\nIdeally it would be someone who is NOT in your wedding party, both since her husband is and the fact people in the wedding party could be distracted by other activities.", "Would Sarah be in your inner circle if she and Mike divorced or he passed before her?  There's your answer.\n\nWedding party is for the very closest people to the couple.  These are people who are physically closer to the couple as they say their vows than their parents.  It's usually a very select group of siblings, best friends, closest cousins and maybe nieces and/or nephews.  Sarah does not apply.\n\nTons and tons of SOs sit in the appropriate pews while their partners are sitting and standing at the altar, watch their partner do the exit procession and first dance together, and rejoin them immediately after that.  She'll survive, just like they did.\n\nSounds like the issue is she's going nuts about him being partnered with someone else, not about her being hurt upon learning that she isn't all that close to you.   This is for her to work out.", "NTA. She\u2019s coo coo for Cocoa Puffs. I was a bridesmaid in a wedding and my husband wasn\u2019t in the party. My husband was a groomsman in a wedding and I wasn\u2019t in the party. That\u2019s how life is. Couples aren\u2019t necessarily a package deal. Stick to your conviction; you definitely don\u2019t want her involved.", "Remove Mike from the wedding. Sarah is going to make your fianc\u00e9e miserable. NTA.", "It better have been a truly heartfelt apology from both Mike and Sarah. Sarah should have taken responsibility for her own mental health and taken back everything she said the day before. Mike should have admitted that OP did not mistreat Sarah.\n\nI would have another talk with Sarah and Mike. They had both better convince me that Sarah will not pitch a fit at the wedding. She needs to promise that she will not come if she feels upset before the wedding and will leave immediately if she feels her emotions rising during the wedding. Mike needs to promise that he will not allow Sarah to distract him from his role in the wedding and he will have someone on standby to help Sarah in case she has a mental health crisis.\n\nAll of the above is assuming we still have an interest in having both Mike and Sarah there. I would seriously consider uninviting Sarah, uninviting both Sarah and Mike, and removing Mike from the wedding party, with or without a regular guest invitation.\n\nOP, your first next step should be to talk to Macy. She needs to know what is going on and needs to be a part of making the decision on how to proceed.", "Agreed. I know it\u2019s difficult, but with Sarah in the picture, the friendship with Mike isn\u2019t going to last anyway. Make a clean break before it ruins your wedding.", "I bring it up because last year I officiated a friend's wedding, the bride invited her Mother but they had a pretty problematic past.\n\nOne of the jobs the planner got was to keep her Mom away from her during the wedding, lmfao."]}
