Yes, you should call the fire department or the police. If you called the police, and are in the states, you could call for a well check and tell them you are concerned for who ever is living there. Call when the smell is really bad so they can smell what your smelling. Good luck OP!", "NTA... HOA's aren't experts, if you feel something is wrong and the HOA won't help call whoever is most likely to find the source of the problem", "NTA, you shouldn't have bothered with the hoa at all, just call the fire department. Hoas have no expertise or legitimate authority", "NTA. Those are 100% NOT dead animal smells. Most likely meth lab, maybe cooking up other drugs but if you're getting sickly sweet/chemical smells, usually meth. You need to call on that ASAP. The chemicals used are so flippin hazardous\n\nSource: I am a former addict.", "NTA- I would call the fire department at this point or public health", "NTA, but don't call about an \"animal\" or a \"weird smell\" bothering you. Can them and tell them your neighbor is operating a meth lab. That's what the smell is.", "NTA...your safety and reasonable enjoyment are more important than ANYTHING your HOA says.", "NTA - however, at this point you need to CYA with the HOA.  I suggest sending a certified letter (keep a copy and take a picture of you sending it) with a timeline of the scents, your various contact with said HOA regarding your concerns, their responses, and finally a directive that you are contacting the various public safety and public health officials.  \n\nI would also look at finding a lawyer who specializes in rental law.  Because the reality is, the odds are the HOA owns/manages the building\u2019s structure and infrastructure.  And they have an inckling about wha the cause is and they don\u2019t want to FIX said issue.", "You being safe is more important than coming off as an AH at this point.

There's a real risk of explosions if that's the case. \n\nBe safe and f the HOA", "NTA If you think it's a dead animal or an animal in general call animal control/game warden not the fire dept. If you feel it's chemical related call the fire dept.", "NTA. Call the fire department.  Let them know where it is coming from.

Ammonia? Someone is making meth next door.

Call the fire and/or police department next time you smell it.  This could be really dangerous.", "NTA you need to call, who knows what you are being exposed to, and everyone else in the building.

You\u2019re not trying to call someone to be a dick; you\u2019re calling because you are concerned for your safety, their safety, building safety, etc. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a second to call, and I agree that you should wait until the smell is real strong again and then call. I\u2019d also document when you can remember the smell, what the smell was, and how you reported it to the HOA.", "1) let\u2019s say that there IS an issue with something dead between the walls that is caused by another owner, there SHOULD be something within the HOA bylaws that allows the HOA to force the owner to fix the smell and stop his/her/their actions that have caused the NUMEROUS instances (hence the written list of dates) \n\n2) however, if the issue is the infrastructure, OP needs to have a paper trail to a) show the HOA he is serious about taking this further, which should hopefully motivate them to actually DO something before he calls in the city/county.  Knowing that they could be fined ON TOP OF having to pay to fix the problem is a good motivator to get things done\n\nAnd \n\nb) provide all of this to his Insurance company is case something worse happens between now and when they figure out what is going on (ex if it\u2019s electrical and there is a fire, HIS insurance can go after the HOA for payment especially if his insurance company can show that the HOA knew they there were issues)."]}
