You\u2019re not trying to call someone to be a dick; you\u2019re calling because you are concerned for your safety, their safety, building safety, etc. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a second to call, and I agree that you should wait until the smell is real strong again and then call.

Knowing that they could be fined ON TOP OF having to pay to fix the problem is a good motivator to get things done\n\nAnd \n\nb) provide all of this to his Insurance company is case something worse happens between now and when they figure out what is going on (ex if it\u2019s electrical and there is a fire, HIS insurance can go after the HOA for payment especially if his insurance company can show that the HOA knew they there were issues).", "NTA - I feel like there is some potentially sketch shit happening in the condo to your left.

Not to mention, those chemicals or whatever is making that smell, could be damaging to people breathing it in.  If your HOA wants to do nothing, then you are perfectly within your rights to call, it's potentially a safety issue, at this point.  \n\nAlso, not likely, but I'd like to point out, when past serial killers had bodies and were doing sketch shit up in their places, people complained about really bad smells for long periods of time.  Sooooooo, not going off the deep end and telling you there's dead bodies there, but I feel like you're warranted to call it in.", "NTA. Check your HOA bylaws \u2014 it sounds like someone is on a power trip and cares more about aesthetics, because it is hella sketchy/likely illegal to fine you for calling an ambulance and not allow you to call the FD. There\u2019s probably something in there about appealing decisions or objecting. \n\nSince they\u2019re spiteful and will likely retaliate, CYA by contacting the HOA and noting the dates you\u2019ve noticed the smell, actions that have been taken (evacuating, meeting with them, checking for wildlife), and that they have been unwilling to provide a good quality of life for you. Keep a copy for yourself and send it via certified mail and require a signature. \n\nThen call the cops the next time you smell anything weird. Tell them exactly what you smell, what you saw when you caught a glimpse into their place, that residents had to evacuate at one point it was so bad, and \u2014 this is important \u2014 that the HOA has refused to take action or let you call before, but you are extremely concerned and need officers ASAP. \n\nThere\u2019s an HOA, but you are a property owner and you need to protect your investment. If you call and there is an issue the HOA will likely turn it on you and say it\u2019s your fault for not doing anything, so you need to cover all your tracks and make sure everyone knows the steps you\u2019ve tried to take. \n\nTBH I\u2019d be wondering who lives in that unit and how they\u2019re related to someone on the HOA board \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f My apartment had to be evacuated a few years ago because the cops were concerned that a meth lab a block away could explode \u2014 and that was within 15 minutes of knowing it was there.", "NTA.

In your shoes what I would do is first, pack up a to go bag with your important papers, birth cert. Social Security card, insurance information, HOA information. Etc.

Houses where meth has been cooked can be condemned. The poisons released sit in vents and stay there being poisonous unless abated. Abatement is expensive. And now likely every unit that shares vents will have to have some form of costly cleanup. Who pays?  The HOA and, when that isn\u2019t enough, a special assessment to the homeowners. And then it often has to be disclosed to future buyers, which lowers everyone\u2019s home value. \n\nMy guess if the HOA strongly suspects it\u2019s a meth lab or the occupants are meth addicts, but if they don\u2019t *know* for sure, they can keep blaming dead animals.
