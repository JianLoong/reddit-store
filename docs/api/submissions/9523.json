Yes, you should call the fire department or the police. If you called the police, and are in the states, you could call for a well check and tell them you are concerned for who ever is living there.

That's what the smell is.", "NTA...your safety and reasonable enjoyment are more important than ANYTHING your HOA says.", "NTA - however, at this point you need to CYA with the HOA.

You don\u2019t need their permission to be safe.", "Yeah.. I didn\u2019t want to cloud judgement by assuming this directly, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking as well. We got a glimpse into their doorway a few weeks ago and it was horrifying in there.", "Same!!", "This, 10000%", "Why does OP have to do all of this before calling the FD? I'm asking because I own an attached home with an HOA, and I would probably have called the non-emergency line at the FD before even talking to the HOA.", "Thanks! I definitely agree on covering myself with this. They fined me two years ago for having an ambulance come twice in two days when I had grand mal seizures - they are SPITEFUL, and moving isn\u2019t an option right now.", "It\u2019s much less of needing permission, and more fear of consequence - I mentioned in a previous comment they fined me for having two ambulances come in two days when I experienced a series of grand mal seizures. They are incredibly spiteful, and selling/moving isn\u2019t an option at the moment.", "I was also thinking meth. OP - it\u2019s a valid concern, and a safety concern. You\u2019re not trying to call someone to be a dick; you\u2019re calling because you are concerned for your safety, their safety, building safety, etc. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a second to call, and I agree that you should wait until the smell is real strong again and then call. I\u2019d also document when you can remember the smell, what the smell was, and how you reported it to the HOA.", "1) let\u2019s say that there IS an issue with something dead between the walls that is caused by another owner, there SHOULD be something within the HOA bylaws that allows the HOA to force the owner to fix the smell and stop his/her/their actions that have caused the NUMEROUS instances (hence the written list of dates) \n\n2) however, if the issue is the infrastructure, OP needs to have a paper trail to a) show the HOA he is serious about taking this further, which should hopefully motivate them to actually DO something before he calls in the city/county.  Knowing that they could be fined ON TOP OF having to pay to fix the problem is a good motivator to get things done\n\nAnd \n\nb) provide all of this to his Insurance company is case something worse happens between now and when they figure out what is going on (ex if it\u2019s electrical and there is a fire, HIS insurance can go after the HOA for payment especially if his insurance company can show that the HOA knew they there were issues).", "NTA - I feel like there is some potentially sketch shit happening in the condo to your left.  I don't want to assume, but worst case, could be a drug making thing, they use some harsh chemicals.  And that can be a very dangerous situation for you and your neighbors.  Not to mention, those chemicals or whatever is making that smell, could be damaging to people breathing it in.  If your HOA wants to do nothing, then you are perfectly within your rights to call, it's potentially a safety issue, at this point.  \n\nAlso, not likely, but I'd like to point out, when past serial killers had bodies and were doing sketch shit up in their places, people complained about really bad smells for long periods of time.  Sooooooo, not going off the deep end and telling you there's dead bodies there, but I feel like you're warranted to call it in.", "NTA. Check your HOA bylaws \u2014 it sounds like someone is on a power trip and cares more about aesthetics, because it is hella sketchy/likely illegal to fine you for calling an ambulance and not allow you to call the FD. There\u2019s probably something in there about appealing decisions or objecting. \n\nSince they\u2019re spiteful and will likely retaliate, CYA by contacting the HOA and noting the dates you\u2019ve noticed the smell, actions that have been taken (evacuating, meeting with them, checking for wildlife), and that they have been unwilling to provide a good quality of life for you. Keep a copy for yourself and send it via certified mail and require a signature. \n\nThen call the cops the next time you smell anything weird. Tell them exactly what you smell, what you saw when you caught a glimpse into their place, that residents had to evacuate at one point it was so bad, and \u2014 this is important \u2014 that the HOA has refused to take action or let you call before, but you are extremely concerned and need officers ASAP. \n\nThere\u2019s an HOA, but you are a property owner and you need to protect your investment. If you call and there is an issue the HOA will likely turn it on you and say it\u2019s your fault for not doing anything, so you need to cover all your tracks and make sure everyone knows the steps you\u2019ve tried to take. \n\nTBH I\u2019d be wondering who lives in that unit and how they\u2019re related to someone on the HOA board \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f My apartment had to be evacuated a few years ago because the cops were concerned that a meth lab a block away could explode \u2014 and that was within 15 minutes of knowing it was there.", "NTA.  Calling the fire department is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  You already tried all the other avenues open to you with no success.  Let professionals handle it.", "NTA. If this is a maybe meth lab like others are saying I would definitely call ASAP, especially if you share a wall with them. The fumes are toxic and highly dangerous, we had a meth lab in our town literally blow up a few years ago.", "Call the police for a possible method lab in operation.  The labs are an incredibly  dangerous explosion hazard.", "NTA. Please call. Probably dead bodies in a barrel in there", "NTA. HOA. is playing it down. Meth house resale or even trying to clean is a joke. Make sure the insurance is up to date. Know of a hole building that got blown up. Only to find the condo building insurance. Hadn't been updated in years. Wasn't pretty one unit was paid for and owner dropped the homeowner's policy.", "Did the police inspect the end unit? I thought Meth as well but it could be a hoarder instead. NTA. You cannot live like that. I assume you own the unit, otherwise talk to your landlord.", "I can't imagine an HOA can legally fine people for using emergency services.\n\nNTA, you've got to protect yourself and the HOA isn't doing its job.", "Call the fire department if the HOA won't deal.

Either option, it\u2019s obvious something not great (or perhaps even legal) is happening in their unit. Thanks!", "If your house is getting fumigated with meth byproduct your health and the health of any children nearby are in danger. Please call for help now, an HOA cannot forbid you from using emergency services", "WHAT?? How is this in any way legal?", "That's completely abnormal. HOAs dictate things like property appearance and maintenance, they should have no involvement AT ALL in access to emergency/first responder services. I would get a property lawyer ASAP. That fine acts as intimidation in influencing people to not get medical attention. It is so far beyond the scope of a normal HOA.", "In this case, if it's meth, it's a safety issue! The fumes are toxic and explosive! I highly suggest you read up on the dangers of meth. If you call FD or PD the next time you smell it and you get fined, you get fined. Get a copy of the report (that's public info) and take the HOA to court. I'm positive they'd lose, talking to a lawyer is free and you might get more back than your fine.", "I watch a lot of true crime, and that's like the first thing that popped into my head, lol.  But yeah, either way, something weird is up.  I hope the situation gets handled quickly, for you and your neighbors sake.  Keep us updated!", "How will they know you called the fire department? It could be any tenant calling. Thr FD isn't going to the hoa and telling them apt.4 called us! \n\nPlease call immediately bc those fumes are hazardous", "This is something you need to mention to the fire department. In your shoes what I would do is first, pack up a to go bag with your important papers, birth cert. Social Security card, insurance information, HOA information. Etc. Your medications, and a suitcase with clothes for at least a week. If there is a meth lab, it's very likely you'll be asked to leave immediately due to having a shared wall, and possibly the entire set of units will be asked to evaluate too. Meth is nasty stuff. It's toxic, explosive, and a major fire danger.\n\nYou should have have a drug task force number for your area. As well as a fire marshal. I would recommend contacting both of them and informing that your HOA is very retaliatory. Ask if you can remain anonymous. Or that the Fire Marshall come in and do a standard inspection to which maybe they discover the issue for themselves and that would leave your name out of it all together.", "It\u2019s a huge safety concern!!", "Also, get those neighbors together and take over the HOA. Change the bylaws and governing documents. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/10fgrkx/how_i_gutted_my_hoa/", "HOA board president here. OP, your HOA is BEYOND out of line. Like, so far beyond they can't even see the line anymore. The only things I've ever done when it came to emergency response/maintenance/access was waived the fines for improper paperwork related to repairs on a water leak (repairs involved trenching the yard and started before the HOA was informed. I walked over just to see wtf was going on and why there was a backhoe and giant pile of dirt in the yard, saw the pictures of the damage to the house, and told the rest of the board that we weren't fining that house that day). We've had ambulances, fire trucks, police all come through for various things at various points and it never once occurred to me to issue fines for that!"]}
