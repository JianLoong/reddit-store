You could be describing a service at my church.\n\nYou are welcome to participate in any service to the extent that you choose - or not. If you just want to sit quietly in the back and watch, that's OK. I'm sorry that someone from the church you visited called you out for not participating - that's AH behavior at any time, but it's particularly obnoxious at a memorial service.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI am not Catholic but what you described sounds like what I saw at my grandparents funerals. \n\nAt both I, and other family members, simply sat in our seats. I did stand for the hymns, I needed to, those benches are hard. \n\nNo one said anything to me or any of the other non-practicing family other than condolences.", "NTA.\nBy your description it was a Catholic ceremony.  If they was to be AH and call you out, that's on them.  If their faith is so weak that a single person failing to go through their rites and mumbo jumbo bothers them, they really should consider if they are really Catholic.", "NTA. \n\nI went to a religious school as someone anti-religion. And you know what I did during monthly mass? Exactly what you did - sit quietly. And you know who told me that was the appropriate way to handle myself? My religion teachers and even the dang priest. \n\nYou were there to mourn the loss of someone who died. The funeral being religious wasn\u2019t up to you and you are in no way obligated to participate. You are there to pay your respects to the dead, not to the church\u2019s deity.", "NTA you were there for a funeral, not to attend mass. Really rude for them to say anything to you.", "NTA. As long as you are respectful, there are no issues. My Dad's entire family is Catholic, we are a different religion. Obviously I have been inside a Catholic church for many events. I participate some and refrain from some, depending on my comfort level.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't there for the religious aspect, you were there to pay your respects to a friend.  Everyone has the right to express that however they see fit, whether it's prayer, singing or just quiet contemplation.  \n\nI'm not sure how you can make a spectacle of yourself by sitting quietly.  The member of the church who made the comment obviously missed the point of the whole ceremony.    \n\nIn the same situation I would do exactly the same as you .  I find it hypocritical to participate in any religious activity which means nothing to me and disrespectful to those who do.", "NTA. You were there to pay your respects to the dead. The living, and their views on religion were not your own. So you abstained. You were just being honest with yourself - and those around you.", "NTA. I\u2019m an atheist too, and I\u2019m uncomfortable taking part in religious activities too. Even being in a church is weird. When I am in a church or synagogue or the like, I tend to do the standing, sitting, and maybe kneeling motions because I feel awkward and want to blend in, but I don\u2019t really say anything. I think it\u2019s ok you didn\u2019t do this though, especially since you were sitting near the back, so your lack of movement would not have been particularly noticeable.", "I was raised Catholic. I went to a good friend's very Catholic wedding and was familiar with the rituals involved but because I no longer practice, I respectfully remained seated and quiet.  No one commented. Probably because everyone was focused on the actual wedding ceremony. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It is perfectly acceptable for someone attending a church service not to sit, kneel, get up etc. It is quite normal for churches to get non-religious visitors who don't participate. As long as you're not actively disrupting the service, you're fine. The person who criticised you was a busybody.", "NTA\n\nYou attended a memorial to say goodbye to a friend, not to participate in a religious ceremony. You were under no obligation to participate in the activities, and your choice to remain silent and seated in the back was the most respectful thing you could have done", "NTA. You're attending a memorial service, not going to Sunday church/mass and holding yourself as a believer. Nothing wrong with quietly sitting. It's unreasonable in 2023 to expect that everyone who would show up for a memorial service would be of the same faith, and requiring them to go through the motions is encouraging hypocrisy.", "NTA, however, it might have been easier to stand up and sit down when everyone were doing that and just stay silent. That\u2019s why I do in religious events in order to be respectful without feeling like I\u2019m a part of a religion I\u2019m not.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t disrespecting their religion and say quietly and towards the back. You weren\u2019t in anyway disruptive. You have the right not to participate and just say goodbye to the person that had passed", "NTA. I say this as someone who typically follows religious traditions, you did nothing wrong. You were there to mourn your friend. Churches should be more welcoming and they should be glad you even made the effort to be there. They were probably just waiting for the right moment to go off on someone to feel up on their high horse.", "NTA because you did nothing wrong.\n\nI was raised in a family that went to church 3-4 times a week (I guess that makes you a better christian?). Came to my senses as I grew up and rarely step foot in churches nowadays. When I do, I do what you did, sit in the back and stay quiet while they do their thing. Occasionally you get the \"holier-than-thou\" person that tries to make a fuss, but 99% of people don't care as long as you don't cause a disturbance.", "NTA\n\nI was raised Catholic and I still do not know all the random phrases and choreography that happens in a service. But I do know that everyone should be welcome in the church. It\u2019s not your fault for not knowing how to participate and frankly I think it would be MORE of a mockery to try to play along when you wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it very well.", "NTA. This person should have been paying attention to themselves and their mouth.", "NTA - NAH\n\nPlenty of ppl don\u2019t participate in religious activities while in the church, and it was only a funeral so the involvement expectation should be lowered \n\nBut if you were just sitting the whole time while people were standing, kneeling, etc. I could kinda see how someone could take offense that. It\u2019s none of their business which is why NTA but it\u2019s reasonable enough to make me lean towards NAH.", "You're NTA. If he was concentrating on what he should be concentrating on, he wouldn't have noticed what you were doing or not doing. It was very rude of that person to say anything to you. No one gets to tell someone else how to demonstrate grief. I wonder how he would have liked being asked if Jesus would be speaking to someone that way.", "NTA. The person that opened their mouth was in the wrong and missed the entire point of why everyone was there. Weddings and funerals involve people that are not religious and it\u2019s ridiculous to expect non-religious people to participate.", "NTA.\n\nI used to be very religious up to when I was 20.. atheist for the last 12 years and never regretted it.\n\nBut I know the drills alright.\n\nIn any case, you're fine. That's just the vocal toxic part of the community, so just brush it off and don't worry about it.\n\nI don't see how any religious person in their right mind would prefer you to blindly mimic the religious gestures, which carry so much meaning for them, rather than respectfully being fully present in your own way. \nEven the ppwho called you out would prolly agree if they took 2 seconds to look past their bigotry and entitlement. \n\nYou did good to take time and give your presence and time to their memory.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been there plenty of times, personally I limit participation to standing and sitting and would  consider anything beyond that to be hypocrisy as it's not my faith though I'm happy to respectfully stay on the outskirts so to speak as the faithful carry on.  The person who called you out seems a little overzealous, in my experience, excluding more evangelical type churches where they consider it their duty to proselytize, most folks understand and will leave me be.  Tolerance is a 2 way street.", "NTA.  I've been in almost the exact same situation as you.  I almost always refuse to attend such events, but even when I do attend, I don't do [all the stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvhYqeGp_Do) one might be expected to.\n\nI'm perhaps \"lucky\", though, in that I've had joint issues for over four decades at this point, and pretty much everyone who knows me knows that standing up and sitting down are activities that take some effort on my part, and I *cannot* kneel (without screaming, anyhow).\n\nNobody has ever called me out on this, not to my memory.", "NTA\u2014sounds to me like one person took issue with how you participate but I\u2019m quite certain 95% of the people there either didn\u2019t notice or were appreciative of your presence in support of your friend. Any other response is just noise, and is in no way your problem.", "NTA, most churches have back rows where you can sit respectfully without fully participating. And no one will be truly offended if you quietly excuse yourself and step outside.", "Would they have expected a Muslim to have participated in religious actions that are counter to their beliefs? No, definitely not. So why should they expect a non-religious person to pretend?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I went to multiple private religious schools, I went to church every Sunday (my mom worked there), and had friends across various religions who would take me to their church services. And at every chance I got, I would ask parishioners, teachers, and ministers what I should do during their service since I'm an atheist. All of them said to do what you did: sit down, stay quiet, and be respectful. You did absolutely nothing wrong and I'm sorry that some nosey busy body called you out for it.", "No, anyone there who objected to you sitting politely and quietly is TA.  You might want to consider standing when others stand, because 1) it\u2019s seen as respectful, and then doesn\u2019t mark you as not belonging (so you don\u2019t have to deal with AHs) and 2) that way you don\u2019t get stiff from just sitting and changing positions is less boring than just sitting still. But not required. Or, if it is required that strongly, it\u2019s a *them* problem.  But, seriously don\u2019t kneel if you don\u2019t want to.  Many agree it\u2019s disrespectful in many ways, to require, or to do it, in someone else\u2019s religion.  \n\nAt my synagogue, at each and every standing time, my rabbi says either, \u201cplease rise, if able and comfortable doing so\u201d or \u201cplease rise, in body or in spirit\u201d.  More service leaders should copy him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I had the opposite experience; I have been to a lot of Catholic and Christian funerals that had a lot in common in form and expectations. And then an acquaintance of mine died suddenly and her family put on an atheist memorial service. It was a shocking death of misdiagnosis leading to missed cancer and then having a month to live once it was detected. She was 26. I was 24. It shook me a bit. And then the unfamiliar form of the memorial shook me quite a bit. I remember feeling almost terror at the lack of a kneeler by the open coffin, the lack of seating, and the lack of anything I knew to do to pay my respects after telling her family I was sorry for their loss. I think I would deal better now, but finding yourself in an alien setting when it comes to heavy things like death can be very disorienting and uncomfortable.", "NTA nobody should try forcing their religion onto others. You don't feel comfortable doing some religious ritual then you don't have to. Swap it around and say some Pagan witches would expect let's say Fundamental Evangelical Christians to participate in Wiccan meditation. Many wouldn't feel comfortable doing that at all and that's okay.", "NTA you were respectful. As a fellow atheist, I would have done the same thing", "YTA When at an event that has scripted participation for everyone, you do the minimum so as not to distract others and to show respect to the person/reason why you are there. Standing when others stand, sitting when others sit, kneeling when they knee, bowing your head while they pray, that's the least you can and should do when at these kinds of events. \n\nAnd no, these kinds of services aren't targeted exclusively for others within that faith. Nobody's asking you to fake anything. Just do the minimum to show your respect.", "Guess they never heard \"judge not lest thou be judged\" before, huh?", "YTA - a funeral is not the time to take a stand on religion. If you don\u2019t believe in a higher power, then it won\u2019t kill you to go through the motions. Instead everyone looked at you as if you were a protester.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We don't even really out right talk about it to other people unless asked because we respect other people's beliefs. They should not have confronted you like that.

Shame on THEM for choosing a memorial ceremony to call you out on the basis of your participation.", "NTA. I have family members and friends who are Catholic.  I was baptized Catholic but was raised as a Lutheran. I have been to the Catholic church many times, but mostly for weddings and funerals. I refuse to kneel.

I also don't stand all the time just because it annoys me. LOL.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you were being rude or making comments or rolling your eyes.

Good on ya!\n\nOP, while I 100% agree with u/\\_mmiggs_\\, I have also found that people have wildly differing ideas about what\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d in these situations. I\u2019ve seen vicious criticism for non-believers who don\u2019t participate in taking communion as often as I\u2019ve heard people state that it is deeply offensive to participate in a sacrament for a faith you do not share. I therefore suggest you try your best to not worry to much about the criticism you received - there\u2019s just no guarantee that you can avoid offending some people 100% of the time.

It doesn't draw attention the way always remaining seated does.", "I think that sitting quietly is definitely respectful of OP -- no need to say the responses, sing the hymns, etc. if you don't believe.  And no need to kneel.  But yeah, sitting while everyone else is standing might draw attention.  To be clear, I don't think it's required that OP or anyone else stand if they don't feel right doing so.  But if everyone is standing and one person is sitting, then attention might get focused on that one person in a way that was not OP's intent.\n\nOP, I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry that someone confronted you so rudely about your attempt to attend and be respectful.", "It\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do when you\u2019re not familiar with the service. I had to attend mass for a class in college and while I was raised Lutheran and knew most of the liturgy, there are some words and music that differ.

Is that not more disrespectful? \n\nI'd argue that even a full and proper believer has the right to just be there and participate solely in their mind. Some ppl have bad days, some ppl have invisible injuries. What the person who called them out did was unfounded and projecting their insecurities.

I'm not Wiccan and I would go and do what would keep me from standing out from the rest of the crowd. \n\nDon't get me wrong, if the OP decides NOT to go to any religion based events again, that's perfectly acceptable, too. But if they \\*do\\* go, the bare minimum should be done to show respect towards that religion. If someone can't do that, then they shouldn't go at all. But if you're there, you bow your head during prayer. No one says you have to pray.", "I don\u2019t know what that entails, but if it just requires me to stand at certain times i\u2019d say yes.

If I'm a member of the satanic church and at my funeral people kneel for Satan, would you really expect my catholic parents to do kneel for Satan or are they not supposed to attend the funeral of their own child? \n\nHonestly as long as she didn't talk during their prayers and just sat quietly through the entire thing I just can't see anything wrong with that. \n\nAs an atheist I do not mind pretend-praying or kneeling at religious services but I don't think anyone should expect it of me.", "Looks like some Presbyterian churches have kneelers, from a quick google.", "Maybe Episcopal? Presbyterian churches don\u2019t kneel or have built in pads for kneeling.", "NTA. I feel similarly about religion and I do not participate regardless of the event.

Maybe most don't but some clearly do.", "you are really jumping through hoops desperate to make a point", "You're trying too hard to justify disrespect.\n\nIf she was to go to a mosque, would she go \"nah mate don't want to take my shoes off, thanks\"?\nProbably not. You comply as you don't want to be disrespectful.\nSame thing with standing up a few times. It's not a big ask, it's a ridiculously mundane task you can perform to show respect.\n\nShe chose to make the funeral about her. It's not the time for ego."]}
