For context, I own my apartment, and I do not have much money to spare on repairs if something goes wrong. I'm trying to remove the guest bed from the guest room to turn it into an office for him so he has his own space in our apartment, and my dad, who has uninstalled my bed many times, offered to help. \n\n  \nMy boyfriend, however, was offended by me accepting my dad's help and insisted he could do it instead. However, he has a track record for being clumsy and breaking things. He has broken multiple things around the apartment on accident, and I don't feel comfortable with him dismantling the bed because I want to keep it in good condition to sell it and do not want to damage the floors or walls. He became very upset that I refused to let him dismantle it. I have my reasons though. Over the summer, he ended up damaging something badly in my parents' house, which I spent nearly 2000 dollars to repair. I never told him because I love him and did not want him to feel bad because it was an accident, but I ended up telling him now to help explain why I feel uncomfortable with him dismantling the bed.\n\n  \nHe became even more upset, asking me what else I've lied to him about. I felt so hurt because I thought me not telling him was the kind thing to do, especially since he does not have a lot of money and would have felt bad if he knew. I feel like this blew up in my face and now he does not trust me even though this is the only thing I have ever hidden from him. Am I the asshole for hiding this from him? Should I have told him about the damages earlier? Should I entrust him with these household repairs and hope nothing goes wrong this time?

It\u2019s just a matter of unscrewing everything.If you\u2019re more comfortable with your dad doing it though then he should listen.", "NTA. Look how he keeps turning this around to be about your reaction to his actions, and never his actions themselves. He IS, in fact, clumsy. Maybe he can do better, or maybe he needs to stop trying to prove himself in an area he's not actually competent in. Plenty of men are not \"handy\" with stuff, can't fix things, and get along fine in life. You were trying to protect him because you did not think he could handle the truth and now he is embarrassed by the truth, exactly as you knew he would be, but trying to deflect that to you. No need to be soft with him anymore. You can simply say, \"Sorry I did not tell you sooner, but I am telling you now that what you try to fix, you destroy. Deal with it.\" EDIT to add, no, you should not trust him to repair any of your things until he has successfully repaired many things of his own.", "NTA. It's your stuff. You are doing a lot, going out of your way for him. This whole project is FOR him. It sounds like he feels inferior because of the circumstances in the relationship, and he's hanging his \"manhood\" on this project. Frankly, I think you should really look at this behavior. When things start going this way, with accusations about \"lies,\" pouting, and basically demanding he can do whatever he wants with your things because otherwise it's hurtful and your fault, there are bigger issues at play than this bed.", "You're NTA for not telling him the cost of fixing his mistake.  But you would be TA if you lied to his face about having to fix it.  I'd love to know what he was working on to cause $2K in damage, that he didn't realize was damage.  I'm imagining a bad tile job that had to be re-done.\n\nBut I can't let you get away with saying  disassembling a bed is a \"major household renovation.\"  Even converting the spare bedroom to an office is not a \"major household renovation.\n\nYour used bed frame is not worth anywhere near $2K. But it is yours and it's OK for you not to want it ruined.", "I\u2019d say y t a  for hiding the damages from your bf; lying is never good in a relationship, but you came clean to prevent further damage. I think letting him dismantle the bed simply because he wants to would be catastrophic. You\u2019re going to risk thousands in damages again for his ego (you mention floors and walls). My son had a pro workshop from Home Depot when he was a kid, sounds like that\u2019s the safest bet for your bf. NTA", "NTA.  You probably should have told him when things went awry.  Job assignment isn't a matter of trust.  It is a matter of outcome.  If he can't do the job to your satisfaction he doesn't get the job.  However, the facts should be presented without accusation and with more than appropriate concern for feelings.", "NAH because I think all parties here have good intentions, but there is a failure to communicate.\n\nYou shouldn't have hidden the cost of the damages from his last job from him. I think you meant well, but that puts him in a really awkward spot of having broken something at your parents' house, costing you a lot of money, and then having no way of knowing or helping to rectify it. I would feel terrible in his shoes, only finding out about it the next time I offered to help. \n\nEven if it wasn't your intent, picture it from his side. He is just trying to be helpful, but now he finds out that 1) you view him as incompetent, and 2) you view him as too poor to fix his mistakes, and don't value him enough to even let him know when something has gone wrong. He probably feels like your entire family thinks he's a dumbass.\n\nAs a result of keeping that secret, you're now overreacting to his next offer to be helpful. Disassembling a bed is pretty easy. If it's a big one with a heavy headboard or built-in storage, it can be a little harder, but it certainly doesn't qualify as a major renovation.\n\nIf anything, he could help your dad, since it probably takes two people to move the bigger pieces anyway, and then your dad would still be there to help make sure it goes smoothly.", "NTA. It\u2019s an ego thing that you shouldn\u2019t entertain. Let your dad do it. If he truly wanted to help and wanted to be involved why wouldn\u2019t he just offer to help your dad? I will say it was wrong of you not to tell your boyfriend about the damages he caused when they happened though. Using something he was unaware of to justify your decision was just not a good move.", "YTA for hiding the truth. Refusing to tell someone about the mistakes they make denies them the opportunity to learn from them. And given you've hidden something this major from him, he has every reason to be distrustful of you.\n\nSecrets are easy to keep - at first. But they have an annoying tendency to come back and bite you when you least expect it. On the topic of mistakes, there's a lesson here, too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe suggest that he works together with your dad although something as simple as dismantling a bed may be a one-person job.", "NTA. He sounds super sensitive. \n\nIf he's careless do not trust him with repairs. Common sense.", "Thank you for this thoughtful response, I appreciate this. I am going to take this approach from now on, I thought I was doing a kind thing by paying for the damages when he was struggling a lot financially, but now that it is being used against me, I will be less kind and soft about these things with him, especially considering how many things he has broken around the house in addition to the major one with my parents", "Yes, I realize I've left out a few details here. We will be doing more than just dismantling the bed. It will be opening up some of the walls to give him more space as well and installing shelves, etc. to make the place more comfortable for him. Maybe not major renovations, but he wants to do the whole thing himself, we just so happened to begin arguing over the bed frame, so I focused on it more in my post.\n\nHe actually ended up damaging a motor vehicle of my parents' by crashing into it. He didn't know it was damaged at the time, but my parents had to get it repaired as it stopped working. This wasn't him fixing something, but it was a case in point about him being clumsy. There have been actual household repairs which have not gone smoothly. He tried to fix our bathroom a while back and installed a shelf unevenly, he has broken the shower curtain a few times, broken glass items in the house, and others. He even tried to fix my glasses that wouldn't open properly on one occasion and scratched them, so I had to get new ones. It's not only household repairs, when he insists that I just trust him for any aspect, when I give him the benefit of the doubt, something goes wrong. In the kitchen, I would not eat the food he made because he does not know how to cook. When he insisted he did and to just trust him and try it, he gave me food poisoning three times on separate occasions. I know he is a very competent person in other aspects of life, but he is not \"handy\".\n\nI also never lied to him about having to fix it, I simply never mentioned it, and he never asked. If he had asked, I would have told him.\n\nThe bedframe definitely does not cost 2K, but, I am in graduate school right now, and even selling it for 100-200 would help me with groceries for a week."]}
