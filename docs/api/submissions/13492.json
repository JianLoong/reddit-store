We will both do better in the future.\" If nothing maybe you could have plans when she is over for dinner so your husband can deal with meal prep and his mother?\n\nDoes your husband share cleaning and house maintenance duties?

He is clean but his parents were hoarders so his experiences learning to clean are vastly different from my own. My mom is overly tidy and has several standard rituals around cleaning that are, IMO, overkill. But our upbrings have shaped us to an extent. Like sometimes, he does not independently think to put his dishes in the dishwasher right away or to wipe down and sweep the kitchen after use, cover his plate in the microwave and wipe down the inside of the microwave once a week, but if we are doing the activity together, he mirrors what I do and is super proactive in the process if he knows what to do. I on the other hand, have carried some of my mom's over the top habits. For instance, I will tidy a little everywhere I go without thinking about it. Sometimes, I will throw out a paper towel or load his cup in the dishwasher thinking he is done with it when he is not. For me it relieves a small amount of anxiety I have from breaking the cleaning rituals that were passed down to me. I am by no means as tidy as my mom but I am very conscious of the rules I am breaking at all times and feel ashamed that my home is NEVER as clean as my family members' homes.

You\u2019re definitely NTA. \nI\u2019m so sick of women making other women, especially MIL\u2019s and people who are supposed to be close to you, feel guilty for having a messy house. A clean house is not the epitome of womanhood like so many weirdos would like to think! The son she raised could lend a hand if he wanted but probably relies on the weaponized incompetence that his own mother taught him to use. And since when is a clean house the marker of a happy home? Once the baby comes, it will be even messier. But the thing is, that\u2019s not a bad thing, that does not mean you\u2019re failing in any way, it means there\u2019s life in your home and as an older woman, your MIL should know that. It\u2019s actually a blessing to have a messy home because it means it\u2019s lived in, there\u2019s love in the house, and soon, happy kids who like to play with their toys. She should learn to stop shaming other women and learn how to uplift them and help them enjoy the parts we\u2019re told we should stress about. This might be out of left field, but I watched a video about a family with a sick child who was declining and could no longer play with her toys. It just really puts everything in perspective and makes you realize what a blessing it actually is to have a messy home. Bc that home will still be there once the kiddos are grown and out of the house, and you\u2019ll have plenty of time to make it clean and neat and exactly how you like. But it\u2019s just not something to stress about, so next time your MIL gives you shit, which she probably won\u2019t bc you did a great job of shutting her down, tell her to shut it bc at least your home is a house filled with joy. And if it bothers her so much, why doesn\u2019t she pitch in to help? You are pregnant after all, it would be very normal for her to help you clean. \nAs for your husband, he sounds like he\u2019s pretty immature. I hope this isn\u2019t how he reacts to most issues that arise. I would just show him this thread when he cools down so he can see how in the wrong he was, and how he has to put that ego of his aside now because he will soon have a baby, and with a baby there is no room for your own ego anymore.
