Someone at my school got caught with vodka, in a clear water bottle, and was so drunk they told on themselves. School is now confiscating any water bottles that aren't completely clear and see-through. Along with the contents in it.\n\n2 days ago I went to school with a metal water bottle that holds ice for 24 hours because warm water quite literally makes me gag. I was told that it must be a clear water bottle and that it had been that way since the start of school however I have been bringing this water bottle since the start of the 1st semester, all teachers have seen it, and nobody has gotten on to me. She then proceeded to say the next time she sees it she will take it from me. \n\nI have multiple doctors who have given legal documents to the school saying I may have unrestricted access to a water bottle at all times, the water bottle may have anything like Gatorade, liquid iv, kool-aid packets, etc to promote me to drink so my heart doesn't start attacking my body. The whole point of clear water bottles is to make sure we have WATER and nothing else which is pointless with me. If others were to see me with unclear contents in my bottle they would assume favoritism which is why I dont agree with it. \n\nSo AITI for getting pissed when she threatened to take it and withhold it from me all day?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That has worked for me", "NTA but you need to learn how to drink room temperature or even warm water.", "Nope it's completely clear, has no smell unless you really try hard to smell it. You could do 50/50 water and vodka and even with smelling it you would think its water.", "Already been talked to, legally they have to abide to it according to doctors documents. They are refusing to accommodate me at this point. The person wanting to take it is the dean of school, who loves to find any way possible to get me in trouble for whatever reason.", "You\u2019re 100% within your rights to make the school accommodate your disability. They may have some flexibility with how they accommodate you, as in allowing you water but also making you have a clear water bottle. They\u2019re being a$$holes if they do that, but they are still allowing you to have water even if it\u2019s not in the form you prefer. Technically they could probably ask for medical documentation that you medically need cold water. Again that\u2019s an ahole move but they could go that route. \n\nI don\u2019t see how your hospital can possibly sue though.", "that\u2019s what got me, the kid was drinking vodka from a clear water bottle, what\u2019s restricting water bottles to only be clear and see through going to do when the bottle with vodka was already clear and see through?", "Yes I have a 504, parents are involved and administration does not care.", "Severe POTS, severe heart block, and inappropriate sinus tachycardia. The main issue is the POTS which keeps me dehydrated 24/7 and the worse it gets the more I will start to pass out and be unable to walk.", "My 504 says I may have a thermal water bottle and anything in it that may help me stay hydrated of course it's a lot more specific in the documents but thats what it says once you summarize it all down. My school is new and small, we don't have a cafeteria students have to bring their own food so getting ice isn't an option. I know exactly what's on my 504 because I was required to be there for the meeting to put accommodations on it that we all agreed to, and they agreed to what my 504 said about the water bottle and the contents inside it. All employees in the school are very aware of these documents, they simply do not care. Sueing the school wouldn't be a hassle at all for us considering they are not following legal documentation that they have agreed to follow.", "I have sensitivity to certain textures and feelings (temperature being one of the triggers). I also have chronic migraines which get worse if I don't have something cold to drink.", "Did you even bother to read the entire post? There is documentation, and the metal bottle is to keep the liquids cold.", "It is documented by a medical professional. According to doctors, I may have anything on me to promote hydration which includes a metal water bottle to keep the water cold considering I have sensitivity issues and can't stand warm water. I don't want to do this because in the past when I did have a clear water bottle with colored liquids they accused me and the teachers of having favoritism and allowing me to get away with things. So technically according to legal documents I am not breaking any rules.", "It was actually the superintendent/dean of the school that made the threat to take it from me. They are also aware of the required accommodations because they helped with updated the 504 not a week ago.", "It isn't an option for me...I quite literally gag from it from sensitivity. I have even thrown up once because of it. Doctors documentation says I must have cold water, not only because of the temperature sensitivity but also because it helps keep my chronic migraines at bay and help regulate my temperate (a symptom of one of the heart conditions I have is not being able to regulate body temp). I am on the spectrum, not enough to hender my learning capabilites, but enough to cause hypersensitivity to sounds, textures, and certain feelings like warm water.", "I didn\u2019t think so. Of course NTA regardless, but especially since their rule makes no sense to begin with!", "Sounds like they'd rather be dean of the unemployment line instead.", "According to my 504 because it's so specific, they have to allow a thermal water bottle, anything that may be in that water bottle, and they have to allow me to have cold drink at all times because it is said in the 504. There is no way of them finding a loophole in the documentation that would allow them to not accommodate those specific things. By not allowing it they are simply just breaking the law. Where I live hospitals are allowed to take legal action against unaccommodated 504s because it is considered a harm to the persons health.", "Contact a lawyer, honestly. If you are in the US they are in direct violation of the ADA and the lawyers are \"we get paid if you win\" and live for easy cut and dry cases like this.

Don't fuck around with them letting your frustration and quality of life be affected, get a lawyer and they will cut this crap out real fast.", "Is this need in your 504?! They can face legal issues. Keep going up the chain. I\u2019m so sorry you are being treated this way!", "Does your doctor say you need access to cold water? It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re denying you access to water but the container you want to bring that isn\u2019t clear and keeps your water cold. You may want to have your doctor write that you need COLD water rather than just saying you prefer it. Medical need is what determines how schools, businesses, etc.. accommodate you, not your preference. I think your school is being too much for making it an issue but they aren\u2019t legally required to do above doctor recommendations. \n\nYour parents need to get the doctor to write a note saying you require cold water. The school could actually come back with they give you access to ice all day to keep your water cold. \n\nNTA for trying to get the school to accommodate you, but they have flexibility in how to do that.", "I have vasovagal syncope. I wish i knew in highschool because i had problems with nearly fainting and when i got diagnosed i was told laying down and drinking a lot of water would help me. Schools are weird with water bottles because kids like the one in your post abuse it. But, that doesn't mean they have to punish the whole student body", "If it\u2019s written in your IEP then it is legally protected. Make sure you tell your parent what is going on and feel free to remind school staff of the IEP.", "Per the post the documentation doesn't specify a metal water bottle, OP states they are to have free access to water, which they do.", "Does it explicitly state a metal water bottle? I'm not saying I don't think you should have it, i'm stating any and all accomadations have to be spelled out explicitly", "Yes its written very specific in my 504, they are very aware of it, they just don't care.", "Yes, the doctor has put into legal documentation that I need cold water and I may have it in a thermal cup to keep it cold. This is because of sensitivity issues with temperature which makes me gag when drinking room temp water or warm water. So they are very aware that I must have cold water.", "They can\u2019t drink warm liquids due to gag reaction, as per the post. There\u2019s only one flask material that maintains cold temperature, and that\u2019s metal. They most likely have that in the documentation if it\u2019s that big an issue.", "Yes it does. It says I may have anything needed to promote hydration including: thermal water bottle, Electrolyte packages, liquid IV, kool-aid, Gatorade, etc. If it may help me drink water I am allowed to have it.", "Where are you located? I know in the US there are organizations that help with this kind of stuff. May need to threaten with a lawyer.", "Then I'll edit my original comment. I know it's a hassle but you may want to keep a copy of that with you for when administration oversteps", "We actually threatened with a lawyer today, that helped a bit but they still aren't accommodating me.", "The phrase your mom wants to use is \"I've never owned a school district before\".", "Then tell them you want their instructions in writing and take them to court. They probably assume you guys are bluffing or something because usually schools freak at the word \"lawyer\" in the context of them breaking the law"]}
