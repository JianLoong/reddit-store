This is by choice, I know ppl say 'you'll change your mind' but I genuinely never want to have children. I have 8 nieces and nephews who I adore, but they're exhausting. Honestly don't know how parents do it.\n\nI'm neurodivergent (autism and ADHD), which comes with the super fun reality that I have sensory issues, issues with executive function, and the innate need to recharge by spending some time alone. I work 35 hours a week and study full time so my free time is limited and incredibly important to me. I've experienced autistic burnout and it's AWFUL so I'm always concious of managing my energy levels.\n\nMy eldest sister T (38F) doesn't understand, I've struggled talking to her about it because she says 'aren't we all a bit autistic' and disregards my needs. We live one street apart, and im the one with no kids so she usually asks me to help with the kids. She often asks me to to pick the kids up, which is fine since they're school age and usually they just hang out and watch TV, and I get to stay in my own home. It becomes an issue when she asks me to watch them at her house. In the past, when she's asked me to watch them she's always been out longer than she's said by HOURS. There's been several instances but for the sake of succinctness I'll tell you one\n\n\nShe asked me to stay at her place and put the kids to bed while she went out for dinner with friends (her partner was at work). She told me she'd be home by 10. I ended up falling asleep on her couch and woke up  around 1am and she still wasn't home. She ended up coming home at 2:45, and I was furious. She knows I work early mornings and sleep schedule is important to me, but disregarded me and my time (I did ring her when I woke up at 1 and she said she'd be home 'soon')\n\nRecently she asked me to watch the kids on a night where I had to work the next day. She asked me at 5pm and wanted me there by 6pm. I was so irritated I just said no, I had dinner plans and wasn't free. She told me that's fine, she'll stay home, and it felt like I was being guilt tripped. But still, I didn't go, stayed at home, went to sleep early. \n\nsomeone snitched that my car was still outside my house all night  so she knows I didn't go out. \n\nIn the past, I've tried saying I'm tired and need time to relax but she'll just say stuff like 'try having kids and running around after them all day' and convincing me to say yes to helping. So I've resorted to lying and I feel kind of bad about it.\n\nNow she's bitching to our family members that I 'never help out' and am 'lazy' for saying no. Mums on my side but I feel like I'm being talked about and it's making me question whether I'm in the wrong. I thought it was healthy to set boundaries and protect my mental well-being, but now I'm questioning whether I should be there for my family members. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?\n\n\nedit: I should say that a big reason I'm conflicted and still say yes sometimes is that I love her kids. They're exhausting, yes, but I never want them to think I don't want to babysit because I don't like seeing them. Her kids are 12F, 10M, and 4M. It worries me that they might not get full context and just think I don't like them.

The hard part is that her behaviour is likely to be progressive over time and it changes forever your relationship with her, and change comes with loss and grief. Please know its not your fault if you grow apart a bit, this often happens when people grow up and take on responsibilities they cant meet.

That means they are not your responsibility.

There is low probability someone snitched on you. There is high probability she checked up on you. \n\nYou do a lot for her, but it is not enough. That's what entitlement looks like. So she resorts to guilt tripping you and trash-talking you to extort what she wants.

That\u2019s one of the many reasons I chose NOT to have kids.", "TL,DR.\n\nAs simple as this:\nNot your kids, not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\n\u201cI love my nieces and nephews, but I have chosen not to have children of my own for a reason. I am happy to help sometimes, but I am not their parent and I\u2019m not under any obligation to help whenever you want me to. You are more than free to hire a babysitter. You chose to have children, that means you\u2019re the one who is responsible for arranging childcare. Whether or not I have plans doesn\u2019t matter. If I do not want to watch your children, I do not have to do so. I\u2019m very concerned that you feel so entitled to my time and my energy. I think boundaries are very important for adult relationships, so here is mine. You\u2019re welcome to ask me, politely, to watch your children. But if I watch them, you must stick to the timeframes you told me when I agreed to watch them and be back on time. Otherwise I won\u2019t watch them for you anymore. And if I say no to watching them, I don\u2019t owe you an explanation, and it\u2019s not up for discussion. I love you, I love your children. But I am not their parent.\u201d\n\nEdit - it\u2019s definitely healthy to set boundaries! The issue you\u2019re having is she doesn\u2019t respect your neurodiversity, so giving her reasons as to why you won\u2019t babysit that are related to that won\u2019t work. So\u2026 stop giving her any reasons. Set a boundary and expectations - like she needs to ask you a couple days ahead of time, she needs to be polite about it, No is a complete sentence, she has to be back by the time she said she\u2019d be back, and you won\u2019t babysit for her on work nights - and then stick to it. Heck, send it in the group chat so it\u2019s clear to everyone. Those are VERY reasonable expectations.", "NTA.  You do not have to justify saying \u201cno\u201d to babysitting.  They ask, you say no.  You don\u2019t have to justify it.  You are not obligated to babysit.", " NTA\n\n\"Aren't we all a little autistic'? is extremely offensive. Your time is your own. You don't owe anyone an explanation or excuse. Next time she asks, just say, \"I'm not available \". Don't elaborate.  Just repeat. Suggest she find a babysitter.", "NTA. You\u2019re not lazy for not doing someone else\u2019s work for them. You\u2019re only lazy when you don\u2019t do your own work. Your sister must be very confused.", "NTA\n\nTell her you're sick. Tell her you had a huge mess to take care of. Tell her you already have plans that you can't change.

You can just be up front and stand by your boundaries.\n\n*No, because I don't want to.*\n\nEnd of convo and if the sister persists, then leave/end the convo.\n\nTell her you love her, love the kids, but you are not their caregiver and you do not want to be a babysitter. It's a JADE thing: no need to justify, argue, defend or explain. You are an adult and not required to do what she says just because she asks/demands.\n\nIf she doesn't back off, then you know that she only sees you as a free babysitter and reassess how you want to go forward with your relationship with her.\n\nThe big thing is to stop caring about what she or the rest of your family thinks. Any of them that say anything to you about how you should be \"helping out\" tell them since they think their opinion matters so much, they must be willing to step in and \"help out\" too, so you can direct your sister to contact them going forward.", "NTA. \"I don't want to run around after kids, and that's why I don't have any.

About half the time he's working night shifts (6-6 I think), and ither times he works days. But when he's home he's always taking the kids out and doing stuff.

I  suspect if OP leaves any wiggle room, any \"if this then yes,\" sis will pry at that relentlessly.

Idk it's just shit tbh", "'I have to wash my cat sorry' hahaha", "She certainly sounds entitled.\n\nAs a mom, I know child rearing is impossibly exhausting.\n\nBut you should never be coerced into doing it.\n\nNext time, ask her: So you\u2019ll babysit for my kids or do me favors anytime I want for the same amount of time?  It\u2019s up to 50 hours now.\n\nAnd I know it\u2019s hard to do when no one else has protected you.  If you\u2019re like me, you come up with lot of reasons to be really busy all the time.

Working 35 hrs/wk + full-time school is BUSY for anyone!\n\nYour sister chose to have kids, so she can learn how to hire babysitters.\n\nBy the way, once you learn to say no, it becomes easier over time.", "'I need to polish my appliances' hahaha"]}
