{"id": 126, "submission_id": "yiw3ek", "title": "AITA for going to my highschool graduation without my step dad beacuse of what I plan to wear ?", "selftext": "Hello, so for some context, my graduation is coming up in a few weeks, but here in Australia it's a different event called a Valedictory (im am immigrant who's been here only 2 years, so please excuse if I don't know much about how it apl works) \nBut regardless, this valedictory is a huge sit down fancy dinner party type thing for our year 12s and their parents and family, and I have a big speech im supposed to give to the crowd, so its a big deal for me and my family. \n\nThe trouble comes in with my outfit. Back in year 10 I began planning an outfit for my graduation, I am physically a boy, however I wanted to wear a long maxi length black skirt with a maroon buttoned up shirt and tie. (The event only has a formal dress code, no uniform requirements) I have no intent on trying to seek attention or be controversial or anything like that. I just don't like how those suit pants look on me and skirts in my opinion are just prettier and more comfortable. \n\nI had planned not to tell my family about this choice beacsue they hold a lot of traditional views and my step dad often rants about how much he disagrees with people who choose to dress in non traditional or  \"non normal\" clothing. Him and I have disagreed many times over our views, but I've learnt to keep my clothing choices and personal issues/events away from him. Cause at the end of the day my Visa relys on him and he is my step dad so I try not be disrespectful. \n\nNow the drama begins. So I was talking with my mom the other day because I was saying I wanted to but myself this outfit for valedictory that I'd been planning for years. For weeks before this she had been asking about it and I kept telling her that it was something personal for me and would avoid the topic. However, during this conversation I chose to tell her, just cause I hoped for some validation. She wasn't happy with my outfit plan at all, but she said that im 18 so I can legally do what I want and she promised to not think differently of me. Two days later we are driving and she explains to me in a lengthy lecture that she had told me step dad (I asked her not too) and that he believes that because he's acted as a father figure for me for years that wearing a skirt to this event where im to be seen with him is disrespectful. She explained that he believes its offensive to him and that im trying to seek attention and seem cool or something. And now he has decided that if I wear that outfit he will stay home (and waste the money they spent on tickets for the event). Naturally im upset by this. My mother said she would still come to support me, but it was implied my younger brother also wouldn't be allowed to go. My mother then told me I had to consider if my attention seeking outfit was more important than my step dad and said I had to now consider what I proroirtise and let her know so that she can either cancel the tickets or not.", "created_utc": 1667269152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiw3ek/aita_for_going_to_my_highschool_graduation/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your mom and step dad are. \n\nI don\u2019t even know where to start; I am sorry you are going through this. Clothes have no gender and I\u2019m sure you will look more stunning in your formalwear than you dreamed you would. This is obviously very important to you and I feel you should wear what will make you happy. \n\nIf you\u2019re still concerned about your status there you should speak to someone about you, you may be able to get a visa to attend university and not have to rely on your stepdad. \n\nBest of luck.", "First of all: your outfit sounds EPIC! \n\nNow to your question: everyone will have an opinion about graduation/valedictorian events. Some will say they are for parents and family because they have supported the student on their educational journey. I personally believe the student should be the focus: you do the work, you get to celebrate! \ud83e\udd73\n\nSo while you are NTA for choosing an amazing outfit that you feel comfortable in, what happens from here is your decision. Does having your step dad attend mean more to you than the outfit? You\u2019re the one who gets to decide (being an adult and making these choices can suck sometimes!) because this is your time to shine. \n\nWhatever you choose, please make sure you will be safe and that there will be no repercussions for your visa. And from this random internet mum, congrats on your study and all the best for a glorious next step in your journey!", "Easiest NTA you're not even really dressing feminin your just wearing a skirt which some men wear all the yimr and its no big deal", "NTA. Your step dad is making your graduation about him and his insecurities. This is not about an outfit by the way, this is about you prioritizing being yourself over your closed minded step dad.", "NTA. Your step dad is an AH for making this about him. You should wear what makes you feel best, this event is about you and your hard work. It is not about how your step dad thinks how you dress to celebrate **your** achievement reflects on him. It sounds more like \"OP, you will be embarrassing me in front of my bigot friends if you do this\". Wear what you want and let him sit at home. I'm glad your mom will still attend, but I hope she will be more supportive of you when your step dad speaks like that again.", "The question is not whether your outfit is more important than your stepdad, and your mom knows it. The question is whether your love for yourself is more important than *his* idea of how you should respect him (which is actually bullshit, because how you dress at *your* graduation has literally nothing to do with him). And the answer is yes. Wear the shit out of that skirt. Let your step-dad know that you're disappointed with his decision, but that it's his choice not to come. Because it is. Anyone who feels excluded by your choice to be yourself is excluding themselves, and they don't get to blame you for it.\n\nETA: NTA!", "NTA. Go to the event. Wear your skirt. Have a grand old time, celebrate the event and your step dad can sit at home sulking. He\u2019s missing out, by choice.", "NTA\n\nI think your outfit sounds amazing. \n\nIf he doesn't want to go because of it then he can stay home, but you're not disrepecting anyone. He's made that up in his own head because he can't open his mind a bit. \n\nThis is your celebration of your achievement (congrats), and it's not 'attention seeking' to be yourself with it. Do you, enjoy it, ask your mother and step dad to be respectful *of you*, and let step dad stay home if he's so scared of a skirt.", "NTA.  It sounds like a really classy outfit.  And you are correct that skirts are much more comfortable than slacks.", "NTA\n\nI generally follow the rule that no one has any right to comment on other people's clothing, unless it's something wildly inappropriate (showing up to a wedding in a bikini etc). Your outfit sounds amazing and follows the formal dress code. I think it's entirely your choice, and sorry you're having to deal with this.", "NTA, OP. Go ahead and wear that skirt with your head up high. It is your graduation and you can wear whatever you are comfortable in", "Rock that skirt! Have a great time and good luck on your speech.\n\nNTA", "I'm going against the grain here and saying don't wear the skirt.\n\nYes, you are an adult and entitled to wear whatever you like, but choices have consequences.\n\nYou say you want to wear the skirt because they are \"prettier and more comfortable.\" This isn't religious, cultural, a big coming out moment or anything deep at all. Your step-father can, and likely will, withdraw his support for your visa over this, particularly if he can get your mum to see things his way - which it sounds like she is already.\n\nYou aren't the AH here, but I don't think a skirt is worth jeopardising your visa for.

I'm sorry she isn't more supportive, and I'm guessing it's because her husband is giving her a hard time. Your sibling will obviously see you dressed at home, so why is he being prevented from going? Let your stepfather stew all by himself at home. \n\nThere are many cultures where male presenting people wear skirts and dresses. Clothes don't define a person and hopefully someday, everyone will feel free and accepted no matter what they wear. Clothes are a means to express our personality and style, in addition to being utilitarian when needed. \n\nYour outfit sounds tasteful and formal. You're not wearing a bodycon, a clubbing outfit, or a slit up to your underwear. \n\nI hope you give the best speech ever, and enjoy your special night.", "NTA\n\nIs your stepdad Christian, per chance? Because I've never seen a painting of Jesus wearing pants....", "Yeah this is the answer. This isn't the typical sort of question this type of thing gets. \nYour visa and this schooling and all rely on this man, which doesn't even go into how you feel personally about him. \n\nYou will have to decide what this skirt means to you, and what you are willing to give up in order to wear it. Maybe the answer is everything and maybe it's nothing and you don't wear the skirt this night.\n\nHowever you say you're an immigrant? Does your home country have a traditional outfit you might feel more comfortable in? Something to think about if so.", "That outfit sounds grouse.\n\nYour stepdad though, gross. NTA.", "NTA. Your outfit choice is about you and has nothing to do with this man."]}
