It takes me about thirty minutes to get to the airport from my place so I planned to leave at 8:30 to get there just in time. \n\nMy boyfriend sent me gas and parking money, and warned me that his mother, while being a sweet old lady, does not like to wait and will leave at the very first moment if she doesn't see anyone. He advised to be at the airport one hour before. I found that ludicrous and decided to stick with my plan because I wasn't thrilled about the idea of waiting at the airport. \n\nCue the drama! \n\nFirst I couldn't get out of my parking space because I was boxed in, that took about five minutes from my time; there was traffic along the highway due to a rollover, another extra fifteen minutes, and finally my boyfriend's mother airplane arrived twenty minutes early, gawd! \n\nI arrived at the airport at 9:20 but by that time my boyfriend's mother had taken a taxi and went home. I called her to apologize but she only said not to worry because I had better things to do: I didn't, I just didn't listened to my boyfriend's advice! \n\nMy boyfriend is angry with me because her mother paid $75 USD for taxi. I offered to pay her back but he said because it wasn't about the fare but because his mother is old and wanted someone who he can trust to help her. \n\nOuch. \n\nI don't think the situation merits such drama, I mean, it was just twenty minutes and the old lady could've waited a bit. \n\nAITA here? Frankly I don't think so but I'll leave the judgement to you.\n\n**Addendum: I should've added that my boyfriend's mother is an old lady who barely uses her flip phone. Smartphones are very complicated for her. Quite frequently it will be sounding off but she doesn't notice so calling her was not a good option, much less expecting a call from her.**\n\n**She just does what she knows and what she know is to call a taxi on the street and use her debit car. That's why my boyfriend wanted me to pick her up because she doesn't want to wait as she, in his words, wants to be active every minute she has left in her life.**\n\n**Another addendum: I just returned the $50 my boyfriend gave me.

The last thing most people want after a flight (potentially a long one if she was on the other side of the country and it was an overnight flight given the time) is to wait in the airport for their transport home to arrive) so the least you can do is to arrive a bit earlier and just wait, maybe grab a coffee or something and chill on your phone. From experience, overnight long haul flights aren\u2019t always comfortable and not a guarantee for sleep. It\u2019s likely his mother was tired and wanted to get home sooner rather than later so didn\u2019t feel like waiting. \n\nSo yeah YTA here.

My local airport is a PITA to navigate, and expensive to park short term. If you do park, there is nothing to do but sit in your car or at a bench by baggage claim. If you circle the airport, each loop takes 10/20 minutes (depending on traffic). \n\nWhen picking from the airport, I do my best to arrive curbside when the passenger will be there - I track their flight, find out if they checked bags, factor in time of day to gauge traffic delays. And the all important communication - if I hit a snag and will be late, I let them know so they can get a coffee or whatever. \n\nBoyfriend\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t want to communicate - she wants the world to revolve around her so that she is not inconvenienced.  If the people around her are willing to put up with that expectation, fine.

You were warned that mom doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting. Airports are notorious for delays, even just when picking up or dropping off.

I totally understand not wanting to be that early. But you lied to him about agreeing & then knowingly went behind his back to not do that. You should\u2019ve just said \u201cactually an hour early is a lot first thing in the morning.

The fact that you were so nonchalant about doing it suggests this might be an ongoing issue for you. Self reflect. Figure out if this is a habit you have (not just to him, but anyone) where you say one thing knowing you\u2019re going to just do another. If it\u2019s not a habit, now you know not to make it one. \n\nSide note, planes often get in early and airports are notorious for getting standstill traffic near pickup zones.

Sure, she could\u2019ve called you, but you yourself say she\u2019s not used to phones and that you wouldn\u2019t expect her to think to call. So why set her up to be in that position?

The adult flying on that plane needs to understand that the person going out of their way to give them a ride isn't omniscient and can't know that's going to happen. \n\nThis would be different if his mother needed some sort of special help, but everything in your post indicates that she's completely independent.

If an adult doesn't want to waste their time waiting for a ride, they can pay to get one immediately. This is exactly what she did.\n\nThe real asshole move here is for BF's mother to waste your time without even attempting to contact you. She knew her flight landed early, and it's not reasonable to expect your ride to already be waiting just for this possible externality. She has a phone and knows how to use it. You're not an asshole for not accommodating the consequences of her choices. \n\nIt sounds like she's used to her children working around her desires, which you could already tell by how your boyfriend prefaced this favor. Knowing that, you should not have agreed to be her ride, at least without telling him his expectations were unreasonable.

If she was gone in 20 minutes, she got impatient and called a taxi a bit sooner than that. Instead of calling the taxi, why didn't she call the person coming to pick her up and see if she's on her way?\n\nI think the main difference is I'm viewing an airport pick-up as a generous favor, not an obligation. Waiting 20 minutes is nothing to me in light of someone doing me this favor. I would still just feel grateful. And I would never expect to be picked up exactly at the moment I reach the curb - it's very difficult to be right on time to pick someone up - the plane can land early or late, baggage claim can be quick or slow, they could have a long or short journey from gate to main terminal... and recognizing that nailing the time exactly is impossible, I'd much rather err on the side of myself waiting than the person doing me a favor waiting in a car or doing endless laps around the airport.", "Right, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she told the bf \u201cthat\u2019s ludicrous.

YTA, Planes have a bad reputation for being late, but the can often be early too, it's best to be there at least 30 minutes before estimated arrival time.

You owe him an apology along the lines of \"I should have listened to you, can I make it up by treating you and your mom to a nice dinner.\"\n\nYou let his mother down by not showing up on time. I would say you owe her an apology, with some nice flowers, and an apology card. Most older people respect someone that can own their mistakes and make an honest effort to reach out and apologize.\n\nMistakes happen, and we learn from them. No one was permanently harmed.

I'm only 35 (almost 36) and I plum ran out of patience years ago.  So if a problem needs to be solved and I need help, I'll ask.  But sometimes the amount you have to wait before help arrives is actually long enough that you can figure out a solution that hadn't occurred to you before, or an unpleasant solution starts to become more attractive than continuing to wait even longer.  And then people get mad at you for \"not accepting their help\" lol but fact is it's just not always possible to be part of the solution, and if other people see that before you, them's the breaks.", "It's why I always just budget my time so I arrive 3 hours early for the flight.

If it\u2019s the latter, 20-30 (or even more depending on the situation and if it\u2019s the airport- 30 or more minutes is usually required,) should be the cushion you need to avoid negative impact.
