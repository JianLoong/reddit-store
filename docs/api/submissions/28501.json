Her son couldn't pick her up from the airport due to work so he asked me if I could and I said yes. She came in a early flight and would arrive at around 9 o'clock in the morning. It takes me about thirty minutes to get to the airport from my place so I planned to leave at 8:30 to get there just in time. \n\nMy boyfriend sent me gas and parking money, and warned me that her mother, while being a sweet old lady, does not like to wait and will leave at the very first moment if she doesn't see anyone. He advised to be at the airport one hour before. I found that ludicrous and decided to stick with my plan because I wasn't thrilled about the idea of waiting at the airport. \n\nCue the drama! \n\nFirst I couldn't get out of my parking space because I was boxed in, that took about five minutes from my time; there was traffic along the highway due to a rollover, another extra fifteen minutes, and finally my boyfriend's mother airplane arrived twenty minutes early, gawd! \n\nI arrived at the airport at 9:20 but by that time my boyfriend's mother has taken a taxi and went home. I called her to apologize but the only said not to worry because I had better things to do: I didn't, I just didn't listened to my boyfriend's advice! \n\nMy boyfriend is angry with me because her mother paid $75 USD for taxi. I offered to pay her back but he said because it wasn't about the fare but because her mother is old and wanted someone who he can trust to help her. \n\nOuch. \n\nI don't think the situation merits such drama, I mean, it was just twenty minutes and the old lady could've waited a bit. \n\nAITA here? Frankly I don't think so but I'll leave the judgement to you.\n\n**Addendum: I should've added that my boyfriend's mother is an old lady who barely uses her flip phone. Smartphones are very complicated for her. Quite frequently it will be sounding off but she doesn't notice so calling her was not a good option, much less expecting a call from her.**\n\n**She just does what she knows and what she know is to call a taxi on the street and use her debit car. That's why my boyfriend wanted me to pick her up because she doesn't want to wait as she, in his words, wants to be active every minute she has left in her life.**", "created_utc": 1696780943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1732rj0/aita_for_being_late_to_pick_up_my_boyfriends/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And instead of giving what he said any validity, you decided to do what you wanted for the least amount of bother to you.\n\nAnd look how that worked out.\n\nAdditionally, WHO goes to the airport and leaves only just enough time to get there without accounting for traffic or delays of any kind?????", "YTA \n\nYour BF was very specific with his request to be early and why. Planes arrive early all the time and traffic happens.  You should have planned accordingly.  \n\nYou owe both the mother and the BF sincere apologies. Also, share this post with BF so he can see how you refer to his mother.\n\nGrammar edit", "yta. this is why you leave early for time sensitive engagements. how have you made it this long without knowing that.", "YTA. While an hour  perhaps seems too early, traffic problems and planes arriving early are routine. You didn't account for that. Plus the way you talk about \" the old lady\" indicates you think of her as someone who doesn't matter to you. And your behavior reflected this.", "YTA - While you didn't necessarily need to be there an hour early, you could've split the difference and left an hour early, giving yourself 30 minutes at the airport. That would easily have accounted for traffic delays and any further parking delays at the airport. Given that your boyfriend was giving you gas and parking money, you really owed it to him to listen to what he said about his mom and make sure you arrived with some time to spare.", "YTA\n\n\"The Old Lady\" as you so charmingly called her could have anxiety issues, could have had a history with a relative/friend \"forgetting\" about her and leaving her to make her way or maybe she is old, tired and out of patience for your (or anyone else's) bullsh\\*t. I wouldn't have waited 20 minutes for anyone either.\n\nYou looked your partner in the eye and agreed to a certain time all the while knowing that you   had no intentions of following through. You Are The Ahole!", "Did you need to be there an hour early? No. Should you have left earlier than you did because 9am is KNOWN to be a time with heavier traffic? Yes. I'm going with YTA because you smiled and nodded at your boyfriend and then did the exact opposite of what you agreed to. You should have said when he asked \"I will leave at X time and if that's not acceptable, ask someone else\"", "YTA - you were late", "ESH. Your boyfriend asked you to be early and explained why. I agree that an hour is excessive but you left yourself no wiggle room at all which is just rude when someone is relying on you for transportation. Mom sucks for not just waiting it out. Boyfriend sucks for normalizing his mother\u2019s absolute rufusal to woah for you.", "ESH\n\nYou were late. You didn't plan ahead and showed up late. That's your fault.\n\nThe fact that his mother wouldn't wait twenty minutes is ridiculous, especially when she knew you were coming. That's just a waste of everyone's time.\n\nBut how on earth did she land at 9:00 and be out of the airport that fast? Twenty minutes after landing, most people are still going through passport control and baggage claim. Edit - reread the post and saw her plane was early, so ignore the last bit.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nYou should have planned for delays.\n\nYour MIL sounds like she didnt communicate before she took the taxi - maybe she didnt want a lift at all? \n\nYour BF as he is over reacting a little.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to learn a bit of patience if she had waited she could have saved herself a $75 Taxi ride.\n\nIf anything she owes you back for the Gas money that was wasted.", "NTA\n\nHer \u201cnot liking to wait\u201d isn\u2019t your problem when you\u2019re doing a nice thing for somebody. Don\u2019t you dare pay her for that cab.", "NTA. If you were an hour late or more I might see an issue, but the granny could have called to check your status. She sounds entitled and difficult. You did the best you could and I guarantee if the roles were reversed, the old lady would find a way to blame you still.", "NTA.

If you thought it was ridiculous that he wanted you there an hour early, or the fact that she wouldn\u2019t wait if you were late,  then you say NO I can\u2019t pick her up.  \n\nYou should have let him find someone else who would pickup her up.  Yes, her not waiting is rude, but he was upfront about that.  You should have just let your boyfriend find someone he could trust to pick up his mom.
