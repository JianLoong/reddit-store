He advised to be at the airport one hour before. I found that ludicrous and decided to stick with my plan because I wasn't thrilled about the idea of waiting at the airport. \n\nCue the drama! \n\nFirst I couldn't get out of my parking space because I was boxed in, that took about five minutes from my time; there was traffic along the highway due to a rollover, another extra fifteen minutes, and finally my boyfriend's mother airplane arrived twenty minutes early, gawd! \n\nI arrived at the airport at 9:20 but by that time my boyfriend's mother has taken a taxi and went home. I called her to apologize but the only said not to worry because I had better things to do: I didn't, I just didn't listened to my boyfriend's advice! \n\nMy boyfriend is angry with me because her mother paid $75 USD for taxi. I offered to pay her back but he said because it wasn't about the fare but because his mother is old and wanted someone who he can trust to help her. \n\nOuch. \n\nI don't think the situation merits such drama, I mean, it was just twenty minutes and the old lady could've waited a bit. \n\nAITA here? Frankly I don't think so but I'll leave the judgement to you.\n\n**Addendum: I should've added that my boyfriend's mother is an old lady who barely uses her flip phone.

Quite frequently it will be sounding off but she doesn't notice so calling her was not a good option, much less expecting a call from her.**\n\n**She just does what she knows and what she know is to call a taxi on the street and use her debit car.

The last thing most people want after a flight (potentially a long one if she was on the other side of the country and it was an overnight flight given the time) is to wait in the airport for their transport home to arrive) so the least you can do is to arrive a bit earlier and just wait, maybe grab a coffee or something and chill on your phone. From experience, overnight long haul flights aren\u2019t always comfortable and not a guarantee for sleep. It\u2019s likely his mother was tired and wanted to get home sooner rather than later so didn\u2019t feel like waiting. \n\nSo yeah YTA here.

My local airport is a PITA to navigate, and expensive to park short term. If you do park, there is nothing to do but sit in your car or at a bench by baggage claim. If you circle the airport, each loop takes 10/20 minutes (depending on traffic). \n\nWhen picking from the airport, I do my best to arrive curbside when the passenger will be there - I track their flight, find out if they checked bags, factor in time of day to gauge traffic delays. And the all important communication - if I hit a snag and will be late, I let them know so they can get a coffee or whatever. \n\nBoyfriend\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t want to communicate - she wants the world to revolve around her so that she is not inconvenienced.  If the people around her are willing to put up with that expectation, fine.

I totally understand not wanting to be that early. But you lied to him about agreeing & then knowingly went behind his back to not do that. You should\u2019ve just said \u201cactually an hour early is a lot first thing in the morning.

The fact that you were so nonchalant about doing it suggests this might be an ongoing issue for you. Self reflect. Figure out if this is a habit you have (not just to him, but anyone) where you say one thing knowing you\u2019re going to just do another. If it\u2019s not a habit, now you know not to make it one. \n\nSide note, planes often get in early and airports are notorious for getting standstill traffic near pickup zones.

Sure, she could\u2019ve called you, but you yourself say she\u2019s not used to phones and that you wouldn\u2019t expect her to think to call. So why set her up to be in that position?

The adult flying on that plane needs to understand that the person going out of their way to give them a ride isn't omniscient and can't know that's going to happen. \n\nThis would be different if his mother needed some sort of special help, but everything in your post indicates that she's completely independent.

If an adult doesn't want to waste their time waiting for a ride, they can pay to get one immediately. This is exactly what she did.\n\nThe real asshole move here is for BF's mother to waste your time without even attempting to contact you. She knew her flight landed early, and it's not reasonable to expect your ride to already be waiting just for this possible externality. She has a phone and knows how to use it. You're not an asshole for not accommodating the consequences of her choices. \n\nIt sounds like she's used to her children working around her desires, which you could already tell by how your boyfriend prefaced this favor. Knowing that, you should not have agreed to be her ride, at least without telling him his expectations were unreasonable.

If she was gone in 20 minutes, she got impatient and called a taxi a bit sooner than that. Instead of calling the taxi, why didn't she call the person coming to pick her up and see if she's on her way?\n\nI think the main difference is I'm viewing an airport pick-up as a generous favor, not an obligation. Waiting 20 minutes is nothing to me in light of someone doing me this favor. I would still just feel grateful. And I would never expect to be picked up exactly at the moment I reach the curb - it's very difficult to be right on time to pick someone up - the plane can land early or late, baggage claim can be quick or slow, they could have a long or short journey from gate to main terminal... and recognizing that nailing the time exactly is impossible, I'd much rather err on the side of myself waiting than the person doing me a favor waiting in a car or doing endless laps around the airport.", "Right, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she told the bf \u201cthat\u2019s ludicrous.

Anyway, Lambert never really recovered from losing TWA.  \n\n\nOn a semi, but not really related side note... TWA always brings to mind band competitions at the dome.

Heck, for all I know, it was only the band nerds at my school and a couple others around it. At least I don't think it was standard nomenclature.", "> After an exhausting day of travel, him being 20 mins late to pick me up drives me absolutely beyond annoyed despite it not seeming like much to him.\n\nYeah, it's not symmetrical at all, because the long-haul air traveller will be much more tired than the pick-up driver.", "Yep, if my loved ones were coming to me, I would have a flight tracker open in a browser tab from before take-off. I mean, I do that, and also I would.", "It doesn't seem like any of them are even using basic phone technology to communicate so flight tracker apps might be beyond them..", "But it wasn't a 20 minute wait. The plane landed 20i minutes early. Which means, if BF's mom had waited for OP, she would have been waiting 40 minutes.", "> And I consider waiting 20 minutes after an hours long journey to be much less of a big deal - it's a tiny percentage of the overall travel time - than leaving an hour early for what should be an hour round-trip drive, a 100% increase in travel time\n\nHave you ever travelled long-haul by air? I just don't get how you can seriously think that way..\n\nLong journeys are harder, especially at the end. After a really long journey, tired, dirty and jetlagged, 20 minutes waiting around at the end is unpleasant. After 40 mins driving your own car, it isn't nearly so. Percentage of journey means nothing here, unless you think that a 1-minute walk and a 2 minute wait is really bad \"because it's waiting 200% of the travel time\" !\n\n> than leaving an hour early for what should be an hour round-trip drive\n\nBut something like that is what you do, if it's important to be on time. You leave margin for error. I travel by air 3-5 times a year and I know this well. I always aim to be early, in order to never be late.\n\n> when I am the one asking for a huge favor, \n\nIt's not so much about asking for a favour. Sure, OP was asked, and OP could have said no or set conditions as you say. \n\nBut OP instead agreed to do it, waved away concerns and then was unreliable about doing it. That's the issue, not the fact that it's \"a favour\". The obligation is not to \"do a favour\" it is to do what you said you'd do.\n\n> when I am the one asking for a huge favor, I would much prefer that I be the one to be slightly inconvenienced than the person helping me out\n\nBF was the one asking, not BF's mother.", "> I think the main difference is I'm viewing an airport pick-up as a generous favor, not an obligation.\n\nIt kind of is, that correct. Up to the point where you _agree to do it_! Then it's more like an obligation to do what you said you'd do. Because your presence is now \"plan A\", not a \"nice extra\".\n\n> Waiting 20 minutes is nothing to me \n\nI've been on many long flights where at the end I'm tired, dirty and jetlagged and waiting for Godot is the last thing that I want to do. OP was being _unreliable_ by committing to doing something relatively easy, ignoring valid concerns about how to do it, and not being there on time.", "Why is it that people think when they are doing someone a favor that means that they don\u2019t have to have any manners. If she couldn\u2019t commit to being there on time she should have declined doing the favor. If I ask someone for a ride to work and they show up 30 minutes late that is just fine? No- if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it in the way that someone needs done it isn\u2019t a favor", "Well, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it\u2019s unclear.  I think one has the right to disregard someone\u2019s ridiculous advice.  If someone told me be there an hour early, I\u2019d disregard it too.  But whether OP expressed this or not is not clear to me.  I think he\u2019s an ah to be mad at her and an ah for having advised her to do this in first place.  What he could have done is arranged for his mother to Uber in, as I said.  No one has to cater to her unreasonable behavior.", "Granny is still the AH.", "[removed]", "She tried nothing and is all out of ideas", "\"if you aren't early, your late\" is a maxim that has served me very well through my life.", "I guess just different ways of viewing favors and airport rides. I wouldn't consider it lacking manners if someone giving me a ride home from the airport arrived 20 minutes after my plane's scheduled landing time. Next time OP should say \"I'd be happy to pick you up, I'll be there between 9 and 9:30\" and person asking for the ride can either say \"great thanks\" or \"nevermind I'll get a taxi\" or \"could you get there an hour early so I won't risk having to wait at all\" and then OP can say \"sure\" or \"nope\". Better communication needed on all sides.", ">  If someone told me be there an hour early, I\u2019d disregard it too\n\nYou know, after reading this phrase, I had a thought. I'm one of those \"15-minutes early is on time\" kind of people. But I'd never aim for an hour early; it's absurd. \n\nBut I think there might be a reason for this crazy request. What do you think that the bf is used to having her arrive late? So, in reality, he told her to be there an hour before hand, to try to get her there a half hour before mom's arrival?", "\u201cMy boyfriend is angry with me because his mother is old and he wanted someone he could trust to take care of her.\u201d Mom is clearly capable of getting herself home from the airport, but boyfriend asked for this favor because he loves his mom and wants to make sure she\u2019s safe & taken care of. Girlfriend completely missed the point of what she was being asked to do.", "And you sound like a selfish person who has no consideration for anyone.  When my kids fly in I always leave extra time so they are not waiting around   Flying can be stressful enough.  She was just lazy and inconsiderate. And I have no doubt same would apply to you", "What is 'entitled' about being frustrated to wait at the airport? Even if the plane arrived on time, the woman, who OP refers to as an old lady, would have had to wait 20 minutes. I don't know about you, I would not let anybody wait when getting off a flight, I'd make sure I was on time, especially if I'm picking up an old lady or My boyfriend's mother.\n\nThe fact that you resorted to such horrible language, is really a reflection of who you are, maybe you should take a moment to jump off Reddit and go look in the mirror, right now it's not a pretty picture.\n\nKindness and humanity is far more important in life than the privilege of hiding behind anonymity to toss out rudeness and immature language.\n\nDon't bother writing back, or do, I don't really care because you are the type of person I will not engage with any longer. Good luck in life, based on your few comments here it seems like you need it almost as much as OP does", "She is not the \"GRANDMOTHER\" to anyone in this post.", "OPs boyfriend did tell her to get there an hour early so she doesn\u2019t have to wait. OP refused to take any of his suggestions & also did not adequately plan her departure. Who doesn\u2019t add in extra time for traffic??", "You make a good point, I think.  Now that I think about it, that would give some logic to this request.  OP *did* leave at the *very* last minute. So maybe this is a pattern with OP and BF attempted to get around it by encouraging her to leave earlier than necessary.\n\nOtherwise, why would you even have to mention it?  Like, if someone told me to pick up someone from the airport, I doubt they\u2019d feel compelled to tell me to arrive early, because I\u2019m like you\u201415 minutes early is on time to me.", "YTA.   I'm the type of person who WILL get there an hour or so and hang out at the Free parking area.  \n\nFor ANY unexpected reasons....accidents, traffic, people who block me in.\n\nSpecially if my boyfriend wanted me to pick up their mother.  I would make sure to be there for her and get there early so she wouldn't have to make other arrangements.", "I think OP should have left a bit earlier.

I personally always pick people up on time and would not leave anyone waiting in an airport.  That said, if for some reason I was waylaid, I would appreciate it if the person would at least wait an extra 15-20 minutes for me to arrive.\n\nPicking up folks from an airport is an imprecise and unpredictable thing in the best of times.  I\u2019ve waited for people to pick me up when they were running late.  It happens.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you felt it necessary to call me names to make your point.  Me and the other commenter were having a civilized exchange.\n\nDo you not know how to engage in a civilized disagreement?", "This post can't be written by anyone over 30yo, so I am seriously side-eyeing how old this woman is. The \"old lady\" comment either makes this made up, or was an off-handed insult. I'm sure BF would be thrilled to know OP is calling her that. She could be fricking 50yo. \n\nI'm also side-eyeing the massive amount of commenter calling her a \"grandma.\" \n\nIf this happened, OP is hugely rude. If you make the story about OP picking up her BFF, she'd still be inconsiderate for thinking waiting 40 minutes is NBD.

A person is only as good as their word and her words were meaningless", "I was using 20 minutes as an example of how long I\u2019d expect someone to wait for me.  \n\nI didn\u2019t condone it.  I said that the bf was ridiculous for asking her show up an hour early.  \n\nYou can read my comments instead of imposing things on them that I did not say.\n\nI get that you disagree with my take.  That\u2019s fine.  But that doesn\u2019t make me inconsiderate or selfish.  I just think that things could have been handled differently by all three people in this situation.  There\u2019s enough blame to spread around, imo."]}
