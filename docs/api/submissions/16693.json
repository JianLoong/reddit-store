This was not her first but it was the miscarriage that put her in the hospital for two weeks and left her unable to be pregnant again. She has always longed to be a mother and now she knows she can never give birth to her own biological child. It has been a lot for her.\n\nAlong with that she has been a stepmom for 8 years to 17 and 16 year old girls and a 14 year old boy. She loves those kids fiercely, and has grown to see them as her kids. But those feelings are not reciprocated and a few months ago she heard that from all three of her stepchildren in a therapy session. She sobbed her heart out to me over it. She told me she really had believed they had built up a relationship where she was now their mother too and where they wanted to be her children, where they loved her. She said it never bothered her what they would call her but that she thought she would at least be loved back, that it wouldn't be this tragic one sided bond.\n\nHer husband has tried reassuring her through assuring her that his kids will likely realize they love her and she is their mother when they are older. He has told her he bets she will be Mother of the Brides and Groom one day, and will be grandmother to their future grandchildren.\n\nShe has been crying to me a lot. She has admitted she has been crying every day since she miscarried the last time. She told me how people have told her adoption is an option and all she can think is how much it would pain her to share the role of mother, that she knows what it's like to not be fully accepted, to not truly be mom to the children and she doesn't think she could do it. I told her it was better to accept that about herself than to take a step that wouldn't work for her, or for the potential child. I then brought up that therapy could help her come to terms with everything. Therapy was recommended by the doctor when she was released from hospital but she was very against the idea. She refused any follow up calls about that also. I told her I love her and she can always talk to me. But she might feel better if she has a professional help her through it. She got angry at first, from her body language, then she cried harder and told me it scared her. I reassured her the best I could.\n\nHer husband was furious with me. He said therapy doesn't work for everyone and how I was suggesting therapy because I don't think his kids are kind enough to love and embrace her one day in the future, that he knows it's what I really think and that is probably why I am pushing her to \"accept how things are\". I told him even if his kids do accept her one day, it won't help her with the grief of her losses and the loss of the baby she wanted to have so badly. He said it wasn't my place to talk to her about this. That it was his. And I suggested therapy for the wrong reasons.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683538787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bjxdd/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_needs_to_seek/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How utterly ridiculous to put that kind of pressure on his kids.", "NTA and her husband seems very focused on forcing the Happy Family he wants. That's not good for your sister or the kids. Maybe he also doesn't want to adopt for some unrelated reason, but using that as justification for discouraging his grieving wife from going to therapy is terrible.", "NTA. And her husband's reaction to the idea of her seeking therapy is disturbing. He clearly isn't opposed to therapy in general if it was in a therapy session that the kids told her they don't love her. So why would he be so resistant to her receiving individual counseling?", "NTA.  That\u2019s a lot of grief and trauma to deal with, especially coming so close together.  Therapy won\u2019t necessarily make the grief less, but it will help her bear it and learn to carry it rather than being crushed by it.  Your reasons for suggesting therapy seem pretty reasonable to me, tbh, especially if you didn\u2019t put the bit about her stepkids to her that way.", "NTA. But this is a very hard situation. \n\nFirst, your sister and her husband should not expect that the children suddenly start to see her as a mother. Not after 8 years. And trying to force this on them would only do more damage than good. It is really sad for her, but sadly not all step children see a mother in their step mother. That doesn't mean that an adopted child couldn't love her. \n\nSugesting therapy was a good idea. As you can listen to her but you don't have answers a therapeut might has. \n\nHas your sister considered adopting, surrogacy or fostering a child? It will not give her the change to give birth to her biological child, but a change to be a mother for a baby/young child from the start?", "NTA", "NTA. While it is true that therapy does not work for everyone, making her mental health depend on the childrens future feelings is a terrible idea, as it is not something she can control and adding these expectations adds more strain to the relationship. The children are making it clear that they will never see her as their mother, this does not mean they can not have a good relationship with a lot of love, it is not unkind in their part either. The mother role for them is filled, and they are not looking for replacements. \n\nYour friend sounds like she has lots of love to give, but relationships require pacing and balance, and she might run into similar issues with an adoptive child. If she is against getting professional help, she might want to consider volunteering/ taking up a hobby and try to shift some focus away from her home life.", "NTA, \n\n>Her husband has tried reassuring her through assuring her that his kids will likely realize they love her and she is their mother when they are older. He has told her he bets she will be Mother of the Brides and Groom one day, and will be grandmother to their future grandchildren\n\nBIl needs to stop feeding her shit like this. They have been clear.", "NTA - your sister needs to speak to a professional who can give her emotional tools and help work through her feelings. Her husband is being small minded, unsympathetic, and possibly controlling. Family therapy is needed here as well.", ">He said it wasn't my place to talk to her about this. That it was his. And I suggested therapy for the wrong reasons.\n\n\nNTA. This isn\u2019t the 50\u2019s, you don\u2019t have to run everything by her husband. Frankly I\u2019m betting his therapy for the kids is about trying to get them to \u201cbe kind and embrace her\u201d, so I\u2019d say he\u2019s the one looking at therapy for the wrong reasons.\n\n\n\nI feel terrible for your sister. she raised kids for 8 years without being seen as a mom (the kids aren\u2019t obligated to but it still sucks for her), and then has a miscarriage where she loses the possibility of ever having her own kids. I hope therapy can help her accept things.", "[removed]", "NTA therapy probably is the best option. It's not her fault not the kids that they don't really love her back or as much as she loves them. I think it's kind of naive of her husband to think it will change and let's just wait until the time comes. Your sister maybe can't wait, she needs help now.", "NAH OP.\n\nThis is something that is incredibly difficult to talk about, but I'll do my best.\n\nYour sister is suffering through a lot right now, I don't blame her for her reaction. She lost her baby, and in the midst of that learned from the children she helped raise for the past 8 years that they didn't love her. How is anyone going to take this? Especially at the loss of another life so near and dear to her heart. At this point, those kids are family whether they admit to it or not, but hearing them say that they don't love you is another type of stab through her heart that she couldn't take. Not with what else she's dealing with.\n\nIt's understandable that she would want to distance herself from them then and talk to you, forgive me for assuming but I would figure you're the closest person to her besides her husband or your parents. She needs time to process, grieve, and accept everything that just happened to her at once. Maybe that whole process includes talking to you. This process doesn't happen immediately, it takes time, and only when she's ready she should go to therapy to work out all of these emotions. You're not wrong for wanting to make sure she gets the help she needs, but at the same time she needs to be the one who says she's ready for it. You saying that she needs professional help isn't wrong, it may just be too early.\n\nI hope everything gets resolved OP, especially for your sister.", "NTA ugh, people who are against therapy but me so much!

She does sound like she could benefit from talking to a therapist.", "NTA damn both of them need therapy. There is a lot happening here. I will say this, you are not TA for suggesting therapy.

Her husband needs to be more supportive", "My sister does not want to adopt. I don't know about his feelings on the topic but she doesn't think it is a good option for her. Regardless, therapy is still something that is needed I feel like. She's not really living anymore.

He does not want her to give up hope of his kids coming to see her as their mother. He wants her to not give up on that idea.", "I didn't. This was all stuff her husband said to me. I never actually discussed her stepkids when I suggested therapy.", "Adopting and fostering she has ruled out for herself because she doesn't feel like she could ever \"share\" the role because she would always feel like the kids would never really consider her their mom. She spoke about that to me because people seem to bring up adoption to her a lot.", "I don't really blame his children. They can't force feelings they don't have and it would be worse to pretend and have it lead to them resenting my sister. I don't think it's right though to focus her hopes on their feelings changing. That is a recipe for disaster for everyone.", "Calling the kids assholes is very unfair. It sounds like they\u2019ve been dealing with both their father and op\u2019s sister trying to force them to see her as their mother when they don\u2019t. They aren\u2019t assholes for not seeing her that way. Calling them stupid is also completely out of line", "Exactly. It's not fair to expect her to wait in hope for the rest of her life and slowly crumble more over time. She's drowning now as we speak.", "I also don't think she should adopt in this state.", "Don't get me wrong, I absolutely think your sister knows what's best for her in terms of adoption, etc and only she can determine whether her opinion will change or stay the same. My comment was mainly touching on the fact that, to me, your post was a little confusing as to whether her feelings about adoption were 100% related to the grief, were entirely separate, or were intertwined in some ways and separate in others.     \n    \nI also agree that the state you describe is not a good one to pursue adoption in. My main concern is that her husband's feelings about the subject, whatever they may be, are influencing his feelings about her pursuing therapy. Therapy and adoption should be two entirely separate issues here, imo.", "There are many topics here where the father is dangling the love of the kids as bait for the stepmother, to keep her around basically.\n\nHe must be well aware that they don't accept her as their mother, certainly after that therapy session if not prior to that. He lies to her so that she doesn't leave to seek fulfilment elsewhere. She needs to see her options clearly.\n\nNTA for suggesting therapy", "So many people definitely say stuff like \u2018just adopt!\u2019 when someone is facing infertility. They really shouldn\u2019t. Adoption isn\u2019t easy, and brings its own issues on top of normal parenting stuff. On the lighter side of things, every single adoptee I have ever known has gone through a finding bio parent phase or at least a \u2018who am I because these aren\u2019t my real parents\u2019 phase. With her history of feeling rejected by her steps, she wouldn\u2019t cope well with that. And then you have the reality that most children who are without parents (that aren\u2019t adopted at birth, and even still some who are) will likely have additional trauma that will surface as they grow. If someone really feels that adoption is what they want, they have to be committed to going the extra mile that adoptees need - involvement in their ethnic community if it\u2019s a different one from their adoptive parents\u2019 (yes even if everyone\u2019s white, there may still be a specific ethnic origin), trauma awareness and really thick skin to any emergent trauma that the kid may misdirect. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for what your sis is going through, and you\u2019re right that she needs help, but unfortunately she also needs to be ready to ask for and accept that help before it\u2019ll do her any good.", "You are right. They may not see her as their mother but they could at least try to see her as a mother figure. Though that is far fetched too sometimes. Stepmother- Stepchildren relationships are hard. Though don't think if yourself negatively. You are in the right.", "My sister never tried to force anything. She hoped they would have reciprocated her feelings but nothing was ever forced on them. Their boundaries have always been respected but she was not aware of how they felt exactly. She thought the relationship growing closer was on both their parts.\n\nCan't speak for her husband though because it does sound like he could have been more pushy than my sister with his kids.", "I know. I'm sorry. The issue hit a little close to home and I probably projected it a bit here. But the OPs line about how they are not the kind to accept her sister un the future made me think there's something else there too. Although it was still out of line. I accept that.", "Yes, it would not be a good idea to look into now regardless because of how bad this has all hit her. But especially when she doesn't want to adopt it's not a good idea.", "Yes, and she recognizes it herself. She knows adoption is not a simple thing. We have a family friend who is adopted and I think that experience and her experience with her stepkids has probably taught her something about herself that is valuable to know when people say \"you can adopt though!\" or \"just adopt!\"", "He sounds incredibly pushy and his ideas on how they will treat her in the future are damaging, both to your sister and the kids. He\u2019s setting up unrealistic expectations for everyone.\n\n>Her husband has tried reassuring her through assuring her that his kids will likely realize they love her and she is their mother when they are older. He has told her he bets she will be Mother of the Brides and Groom one day, and will be grandmother to their future grandchildren.\n\nWith that, I\u2019d imagine behind closed doors, these kids have had this mentality pushed on them continuously", "They probably aren\u2019t the kind because it\u2019s been a forced relationship. Their mom might be dead and they could be going through the situation you see on this sub all the time where the parent forces the stepparent on the kids and erases their deceased mom. It\u2019s gross and cruel. Even if it\u2019s just divorce, they still owe this stepparent nothing. They are humans with their own agency\n\nYou say you\u2019re projecting, are you also trying to force a relationship on children that you have no right to do?", "I think you could be right. It's not something I witnessed but it does make me wonder given how he brought this up to her in the way he did.", "I'm not married. But I've seen this happening very closely. The children would belittle and play cruel jokes on the stepmother who was close to me all the while the stepmother hoped they would accept her not even as a mother but just as someone who is there in their life and treat her with humanity. The husband in this case too just thought that the children would accept the new mother and turned a blind eye at their antics.", "I would also be concerned about your sisters actions. Even if she\u2019s not expressly pushing, it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s objecting to this narrative that the kids don\u2019t agree with", "The children are still not at fault. Why, because they are children. The parents need to be supporting their emotional needs. It\u2019s the husband at fault, not the kids", "My sister is confused by the stuff her husband is saying. She's hurting, grieving, she's lost and I don't think she's actively doing anything harmful to anyone other than herself. I fully believe she is not forcing anything on these kids. All she did was get her hopes far too high and have it come crashing down around her at the worst time, when she was already in need of help and grieving the loss of her chance to have a child.", "In the OPs case they're no longer children and norther are the in my friends. The oldest is 17 in both and if you 18 is an adult it's not like they'll miraculously the day before their birthdays attain all of worlds wisdom. Children can be given a free pass but in a limit. If their mother has died they should be even more grateful that they were lucky enough for someone who loves them. And don't misconstrue it as if I'm saying they should accept her as their mother. No. No one can truly ever replace a mother in your life. But still it's not too much to ask for human decency.", "Honestly it sounds like they only signed up for family therapy with the kids to push them to accept her if he\u2019s objecting to her getting personal therapy. She\u2019s been in the picture for 7 years before the miscarriage. How is this such a shock", "In op\u2019s case the kids are 17, 16, and 14. All children. Don\u2019t nitpick. Obviously I don\u2019t know the details of the not your kids situation, but stop blaming children (who are still children at 17) who did not receive emotional support from their father. Telling them they should be grateful to have a woman they don\u2019t want in their lives is gross", "He actually signed them up. He said it was something they needed to do because there were some things that needed to be worked on. She went along because she thought from the way he said it, that the kids wanted it. \n\nI think my sister grew so close to them, felt so much love for them, that she didn't realize it wasn't returned. They don't hate her. They have a pretty friendly relationship usually. It might have given her false hope, led her to cling to that hope in her grief.", "Dear god she really does need therapy. You def NTA for that. But I do think you might be seeing your sister through rose colored glasses. Unless she was actively objecting to him pushing this narrative, she was condoning that it continued. Pushing them to accept a stepparent as a full parent to this extent can only happen if the stepparent goes along with it like this. This is more than just the last year and her miscarriage. It\u2019s about the whole last 8 years"]}
