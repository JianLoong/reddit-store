It was messy and horrible, but eventually it settled, until this happened.\n\nFast forward to mid 2022, when my dad phoned me and explained that he was seeing someone (I'll call her A). I knew that my parents would eventually move on, so I took it fairly well. Over the course of the next few days, I learnt a lot more about how their relationship came to be, and that it wasn't as innocent as my father lead on. \nTurns out, they had, what my father calls, an \"inappropriate friendship\" while my parents were still together. He swears it never got physical, but admits that he did seek an inappropriate amount of emotional support from her. When this news came out, I had a very hard time processing this information. I'd never thought that my dad could do something like this. He was my hero, the person I looked up to, and in the beginning of the separation, he was the person I leaned on the most for support. I felt like I could always go to him for help, that we could talk about anything and have constructive conversations. But after I learnt this... it felt like he broke my trust in him. Some time passed, and I was able to process and heal a bit, but I didn't know how I felt about A, and if I ever wanted to meet her. She is part of the reason my family is broken. Eventually, I met her, and from then on I began to see her more frequently, but the more I saw and interacted with her, the more conflicted I was becoming, not to mention it made me physically ill to see my dad being romantic/flirty with someone besides my mother. \nI recently came to the decision that I cannot afford to give A the relationship she and my father may want me to have with her. There is too much pain and betrayal for me to just act like it didn't happen, or that I'm perfectly fine that my dad is dating the person he cheated on my mother with. And yes, my dad may call it an \"inappropriate friendship\", but to me, if you go and do something with someone, that you should be doing with your spouse (physically or emotionally), you cheated.\nA phone conversation took place recently, and my dad told me that he didn't like that I don't say hello or goodbye to A, and that he raised me to be polite. I agreed with him that me not doing so is impolite, but besides that, I am polite when she engages with me, though I never initiate conversation.\nBy the end of the phone call, we both established boundaries.\nHis: \"I expect you to be polite when you are around her\"\nMine: \"I expect you to tell me is she is attending a social gathering, so I can decide if I want to see her.\"\nI made it clear that because of our boundaries, I may choose not to attend these gatherings, and that I'm not doing this in spite of him, or to make him feel bad, I'm just trying to respect his boundary while also upholding my own.

He's probably lying about the extent of the \"inappropriate relationship.\"\n\n2.  Cheating on your wife isn't polite, and neither is dating a married man, so they aren't in a position to complain.\n\n3.  You aren't obligated to make nice with your father's new mistress - especially not with everything is so new.  Maybe in a few years.", "NTA. I'm so sick of parents like this. He tacitly wants you to help create the image that all is fine and dandy. No one is entitled to a relationship with you, esp not an AP. Don't poke holes in your boundaries and stay firm.", "NTA\n\nA is not entitled to a relationship with you.  Your father is not entitled to demand you have a relationship with his paramour.  Whether or not you have a relationship with A is entirely up to you, and deciding you do not want a relationship with her is a perfectly valid choice.  \n\nYou won't be the only one.  Plenty of people out there who keep distance between themselves and those who choose to have \"inappropriate friendships\".  Your dad may not like that the consequences of his and A's choices will likely include people not wanting to have relationships with them, but that's what happens when you don't respect relationships (like marriages) yourselves.", "Your father (and his GF) are not free from the consequences of their actions and the hurt that those actions cause.\n\nBe polite, but it is absolute NTA to keep your distance. You don't need a relationship with her if you do not want one. Be polite but if she is actually partially responsible for the demise of your parents' marriage, then that right there is a nail in the coffin that your Dad built for his marriage.", "NTA, but you are focusing on the wrong person. He's the one who made a commitment to your mom, and he is the one who made the choice to break it. Otherwise, no matter what she did, he would have shut her down.\n\nYou don't have to have a relationship with her, but she isn't the biggest issue here.", "You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to have a relationship with whoever you don\u2019t want to have a relationship with. But you are an ah for holding the girlfriend to a higher standard than your father. He\u2019s the one who betrayed your mother.", "NTA. I agree with you 100% that if you are doing something with someone else that you are supposed to only be doing with your spouse, physically, mentally, emotionally, whatever it is, then you are cheating and I also have no trust in cheaters. I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this and that your dad hurt you like this. However he can\u2019t be mad at you for how his actions made you feel. It\u2019s his own doing. While he may have raised you to have good manners he probably also taught you about respect of which he and his new A don\u2019t show you by demanding respect and manners from you even though they are responsible for you going through your parents separation and heartache. Your feelings are yours and you\u2019re allowed to have them. You don\u2019t have to like her or spend time with her if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA \n\nWell done.", "This is a hard one. I was you over 20 years ago. My parents' marriage because my father cheated. He then started to officially date the other woman. He eventually married her and had another child with her.\n\nSo believe me when I say I know how you feel. And believe me when I say things will get better.\n\nI do think you should be polite and saying hello is part of that. And I don't think you should make your father choose between attending an event with her or with you. It has been over an year since the divorce and life needs to get back to a sense of normal.\n\nWhat I always demanded for instance was that his wife never tried to act like my mother. My father and my mother were my only parents. She was just furniture in that regard.", "I mean, I would get this behavior if you were a teenager but you\u2019re an adult. I get children like to create images in their heads that their parents are perfect but no one is. \n\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t her, there still would have been a good chance that your parents still would have separated.\n\n\nI lean towards \u201cyou\u2019re handling this badly and may need some therapy\u201d to help process this. I wouldn\u2019t give you a full blown asshole label though.\n\n\nNAH. Just someone who needs to process that sometimes relationships end", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do wanna clear up that I don't expect him to choose between us. She is more than welcome to attend gatherings, and if I do not go, it's my choice.
