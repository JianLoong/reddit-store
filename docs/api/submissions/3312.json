She fucked around and found out.  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencememes/comments/xr5qrf/fuck\\_around\\_and\\_find\\_out/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencememes/comments/xr5qrf/fuck_around_and_find_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "You said \"thank you\" how is that rude? what more could she possibly ask for? \"Omg you're so right thanks so much for changing my life!\"\n\nYou just said it was unsolicited which it was, whether she was \"just trying to be helpful\" or not. No one fucking asked her, that's what unsolicited means.\n\nAnd her input didn't make any sense. Of course you would want to pursue a career you got a degree for. It's why you paid thousands of dollars for it! Why would someone let \"loyalty\" waste their very expensive degree?\n\nNTA", "NTA  sounds like she needed a reality check.", "ESH. Your cousin's wife for obvious reasons. But you- you just sound like a super bitter unpleasant person. You need to find a way to deal with your past trauma.", "NTA. That was fabulous.", "NTA. You set boundaries in a way that forces people to take a real hard look at themselves. I\u2019m proud of you.", "NTA", "You were definitely right, but the comment was AH behavior, depending on the tone. If it was curt and direct, then ok, but if it was passive-agressive, then AH. You were 100% right and should have said it, but maybe dial back the passive agressiveness a bit. \n\nI struggle with this. I tell people they are wrong ALL THE TIME. They hate it. No one likes to be told that they are wrong. It took years of tears and glares from others to learn it was the tone that stung, not the words. Now, I am more direct, but gentler. I often explain that they were saying hurtful or rude things because... and then explain the rudeness. It takes practice, but you will get the tone shift eventually. Good luck!", "Nta", "NTA. Cousin\u2019s wife ruined the night with her judgemental guilt trip. You simply threw that energy back at her and instead of apologizing for her rude judgemental comments she doubled down by saying she was being helpful. She wasn\u2019t. She was being rude and disrespectful. She wasn\u2019t just stating an opinion, she was putting down the accomplishments that your family was proudly congratulating you for and trying to make you feel bad. Your cousin and his awful wife owe you an apology. You didn\u2019t ruin thanksgiving and make everyone feel awkward. The jealous and judgemental wife of your cousin did.", "NTA, she was intrusive, rude, and judgmental. Bizarre way to act in front of your extended in-law\u2019s that you\u2019re meeting for the first time! \n\nIt almost sounds like she was jealous you were getting attention? Whatever her reasoning, she was in the wrong.", "If your opinions are fact based... And hers are emotionally based ... Then she needs better arguments!  Or to understand that \"SHE NEEDS BETTER ARGUMENTS\" To support her \"opinion\"! Otherwise... There's no argument to be made!!!", "Appropriate response to a rude and judgemental comment.", "NTA, not even a little bit. She doesn\u2019t pay your bills, so she needs to stay in her lane. You can tell her I said so.", "NTA, but only commenting to say I love your strategy and will be implementing into my life :)", "NTA but I also think it could've been handled better as it escalated. Not your original response, which I think was justified. But I would've just ignored her after she said she was just trying to be helpful. Sounds like a great time to ask Uncle Larry about his boat.", "You, OP are a rock star and absolutely NTA. I tend to shut people down in similar fashion, because I love myself and I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin, plus I ran out of f*#%s to give circa 1993 so there\u2019s that. I\u2019m proud of you for standing up for yourself and calling out poor behavior. Good on you, and congratulations on your new job!", "NTA - She doesn\u2019t know you, your relationship with your dad, or anything about the inner workings of the family business. If you and your parents are happy with this career change no other opinions should be considered. If she thinks it\u2019s a bad idea she should tell her husband about it in the car on the way home.", "NTA. For your shutdowns, may I also suggest the classic:\n\n\u201cDid I ask?\u201d", "NTA you were I the right.", "This is the first time she met you and she felt free to say such a thing?  She is definitely rude, and I love the way you shut her down.\n\nThe rest of your family being happy for your career change should have been the first clue to her that her opinion was entirely irrelevant, even if it was appropriate to voice it.", "NTA. Sounds more like a scolding she attempted to give you than an opinion, and frankly who goes up to a complete stranger (since this is the first time you met) and scolds them for their career choices. His wife needs to learn to stay in her lane. Freedom of speech doesn't free someone from consequence of their speech, you simply taught Cousin's wife that valuable lesson.", "NTA. I'd say that you're awesome, but you didn't really ask for my opinion :)", "NTA If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen. People always act so shocked when they get called out for being rude. I love the actual look on their face, like, wtf? You were just supposed to take my being rude with your head down in shame, not call me rude to my face and embarrass me back like that.\n\nEdit to say, you are my hero.", "NTA - To me, the cousin's wife needed to stick to her own business, and she was not being helpful one bit with her rude comment about you. It's even worse because this person has just barely met you and now she starts throwing around such a judgmental opinion. The cousin is also an AH because he knows better (or should) where you're concerned, and perhaps should have told his wife to back down. But, I see where he shoved his head...\n\nGood on you for standing your ground. I would've handled it the same way.", "Nta", "NTA ask for a detailed explanation for how she was being \"helpful\". Exactly what help was she offering? Who was it helpful to? How was her help going to improve their life? They won't be able to answer. She knows she was just being a bitch to you and was possibly trying to curry favour with your dad.", "NTA. She was being rude and offered an entirely unsolicited opinion on your life path choices. And btw, who the hell does that when meeting someone for the first time at a family holiday dinner? Apparently AHs like her. Frankly, I think you handled it with grace. Also, congrats on the new job!", "NTA you handled that perfectly \ud83d\udc4c.\n\n\nWhen people give you shit like that, throw it right back at them", "NTA. You didn't make it awkward - she did when she gave unsolicited \"advice\" and was rude about it - regardless of being directly \"rude\" (in quotes only because you were directly \"rude\" in her and your cousin's eyes, at least) or being rude under the guise of giving advice - and your cousin did when her rudeness is expected to be accepted \"because she was just stating an opinion/trying to be helpful\" but your are expected to apologize for your \"rudeness\" when you were only doing what she did - stating an opinion.\n\nThis will be a good lesson for her (and your cousin) and hopefully they learn that it was rude and rudeness does not have be tolerated regardless of if it was direct or not and intentional or not.\n\nShe should think before she speaks.", "NTA\nIf you can't handle whatever reply someone may give, you should keep your mouth shut. I don't even think you were rude lol", "An opinion is when you help someone pick an outfit out for an evening out. Not what you should be doing for a living! NTA she\u2019s new to the table. She needs to learn! Great teaching moment for her!!", "NTA. She offered judgmental, unsolicited advice on a situation she knew next to nothing about. Then she doubled down on it!", "NTA she was rude and fucked around and found out. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Cousin's wife had zero knowledge of the family business situation. Our kids worked for their dad.  It was never intended to be a career for them, just a way to earn some money while in school. He was happy to help them, but  also happy when each child found a job in their chosen field. Someone criticizing any of them for leaving, would have been out of line.", "NTA. Although she's entitled to her opinion it's not her place to tell you give up your dreams to stay at your father's business. If your father is okay with it, she has no right to speak on his behalf. I hate people who insert themselves that way.\n\nYou were right, she was wrong. And your cousin is an idiot", "Is it uncomfortable carry those big ole brass balls around all the time? I wish I had the ability to shut it down like that! NTA", "NTA, but, you\u2019re feeling bad about it now because you know you could have handled it better.  That\u2019s your conscious giving you a nudge.  It\u2019s great that you learned to speak up for yourself, but I get the feeling that now you\u2019d like to learn how to do it with grace and sensitivity.", "NTA. She was rude and judged you, not realizing she was tude first, and judged you first.", "NTA She was being rude and judgemental to her husband's family. She wasn't expecting someone to dish it back and had a tantrum when you pointed out her behavior.", "YTA", "NTA because she was incredibly rude and intrusive without even knowing you.  Your reply was perfectly valid and the whole family knew it.", "IKR OP is a badass.\n\nFirst time that woman meets someone and she starts lecturing OP about what to do with her life? NTA", "My polite response is I don\u2019t recall asking for your opinion.\n\nMy rude one is if I cared about your opinion I would have asked.", "Agreed. \n\nMore like OP brought the AK-47 ... \n\nCousin's rude GF brought Fonzie's switchblade styling comb, and she forgot to bring the hair gel.", "Or, as a retort \"if I want any lip from you, I'll scrape it off my zipper\".  That would be ruder still!", "they said bootlicky not bootylicky \ud83d\ude02 what\u2019s on your mind Nana?", "She sounds tiring. I don't think I could have been as polite as you, but since I love your response so much, I'm planning on stealing it for myself! You're most emphatically NTA. What she said was absolutely asinine! I'd have been rolling my eyes and telling everyone \"That rattling sound you hear? Yeah, that's my eyes rolling!\"", "That's an excellent question... Why does she care or feel comfortable enough to question what someone whom she's never met on how they live?", ">what\u2019s on your mind Nana? \n\nI'm cackling, omg. This thread is too much.", "NTA I've had my grandkids in the kitchen (4-14) helping prep food the last 2 Thanksgiving weekends, day after to give parents a break. No reason a grown adult can't help prep a salad or chop veggies.", "I ask rude people to explain what they mean and question them until I'm satisfied that they've completely exposed themselves. You wouldn't believe the amount of squirming I've caused, especially at work lmao", "oh Zoidberg!", "Sounds like she had a knee-jerk reaction - maybe she has some regrets about her relationship with her own father.", "This is the best thread to come to after work. I'm dying! \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Exactly! \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I originally started learning to cook as a child to get out of washing dishes", "At the restaurant I used to work out of, every single person started out as dishwasher."]}
