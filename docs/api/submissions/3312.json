This is the first time that we met (they live in another state, met and married during the pandemic).\n\nWe were talking around the table when it was brought up that I changed jobs. I left my father's business for something that uses my degree. Everyone was congratulating me for finally having a foot in the door, and saying that I would have a great career. \n\nThen my cousin's wife, out of nowhere, says that I should have been more loyal to my father, that helping him is better and more fulfilling than chasing after a career in my field. So I told her \"thank you for the unsolicited opinion on my life\".\n\nShe got upset, and more so when no one rebuked me.

You did not ruin Thanksgiving, your cousin and his rude wife did that.", "No, NTA, this is prime Thanksgiving family entertainment.", "NTA. You have learned to brush off rude/unwanted comments, but she is a bit of a snowflake in that she is unable to deal with criticism.

Telling you that you should\u2019ve been loyal to your father\u2019s business isn\u2019t a piece of advice or a tip on how to get a higher salary or anything of the sort.

First, was it really *just* an unsolicited opinion? because her wording comes off like she's trying to tell you what to do/shame you for your decision.

I don't think you ruined thanksgiving, you're not the one that said something so rude and thoughtless.", "NTA!! Good on you for maintaining boundaries. She obv needed this lesson.", "NTA.
