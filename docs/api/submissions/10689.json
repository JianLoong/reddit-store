{"id": 10689, "submission_id": "119rdv1", "title": "AITA for not wanting to speak to my BFF (of 17 years) ever again after her wedding?", "selftext": "My best friend moved to FL about 2 years ago, and I, being a busy single mom, have not had the chance to visit her from CA since her move. So when she got engaged and asked me to be the MOH, I was thrilled and immediately jumped in to help her plan. I own a catering company, so I guided her through the planning process, negotiated catering logistics for her, and helped with the tiny details prior to the day of the wedding. \n\nBFF was very close to my brother and sil, they had an emergency a month prior so I offered to flip the bill to fly all 5 of us to FL from CA. I rented a giant suv to drive everyone while they partied and spent thousands to be there.\n\nDay of the wedding I was scrambling to help get the venue set up for the ceremony and reception, sil was right by my side helping, rushed back to the house to do hair and makeup and took everyone to the venue that was less than a mile from her house. Dropped everyone off, made sure the \"first look\" pictures started smoothly and realized I left a bag of mine at her house. With 15 minutes before the ceremony started I went back to the house to grab my bag, called BFF to get anything else she may have forgot, was driving back to the ceremony when a car attempted to run a red light, turned left in front of me and caused the worst major car accident I've ever had. Airbags deployed, my hearing immediately was gone, I kicked my way out of the car and sat on the curb until an ambulance arrived. I was taken to the hospital to be evaluated and I missed my BFF's entire wedding. I was devastated and I apologized to her text messages for overshadowing her day. \n\nI was finally released at midnight from ER, went back to airbnb in a brace, badly bruised, no hearing and on pain killers. I had to spend the entire next day preparing to fly home by getting rx's, noise cancelling headphones for my flight, getting photos of car for insurance before leaving the state and hiring an attorney to represent me. \n\nBFF came to the house the night before we all departed to say goodbye and seemed very annoyed with me. She asked me why I had left the venue to go to her house, I explained I left my bag there, then turned her attention to sil and conversed about something I could barely hear. She was short and brief before leaving and I felt ill over our encounter, but dismissed it and went to bed. \n\nIt's been 2.5 weeks since the accident and she hasn't called me to check on me once, she text me only after I text to ask how the honeymoon was and went as far as to post photos of the wedding on Instagram and tagged my sil to say thank you for all of her help multiple times without ever acknowledging my presence or saying thank you to me. \n\nI feel deeply hurt and think letting this friendship go peacefully would be the easiest path. \nAITA for thinking and feeling this way?", "created_utc": 1677136211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119rdv1/aita_for_not_wanting_to_speak_to_my_bff_of_17/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's too bad she hasn't been there for you \nmaybe write her a letter detailing all of this and your disappointment that she couldn't even be bothered to call to check up on you when you were in a major accident. See how she responds.", "NTA\n\nIt honestly sounds like \"BFF\" was more interested in your wedding planning acumen than you as a person.\n\nYou were in a major accident!  \n\nLet this woman go.  She's not someone you need in your life.\n\nI hope you are feeling better!\n\nHugs", "NTA. She comPLETELY neglected you when you needed help, not even checking up on you? That's cruel. Selfish.", "Definitely NTA but your friend is. That's so hurtful after you helped so much, to ignore you after a huge car accident? I understand a wedding is a big deal but Jesus, you could have died! I would be so worried for my best friend, not mad at her at all?\n\nAnd then the petty ness over tagging everyone but you? She's not your friend and doesn't deserve your friendship. Let her go, she sounds selfish.", "NTA - it sounds like your friend is blaming you for the accident, even though it was in no way your fault. She sounds very selfish and self absorbed. If she can't be understanding under the circumstances, then you're better off without her as a friend.", "NTA. Her first concern is why you went back to the house and not your health and well being now? Yo, I question that too. Getting married doesn't mean leaving friends behind.", "NTA! and ooooh boy do not let this go peacefully. all that will do is benefit her at your expense.", "NTA. There's nothing there for you to salvage.", "NTA . I have a question related to the accident if it's okay. What caused the hearing loss? Was it the airbag (the impact?) It just intrigued me since clearly anything could happen in an accident but it never occured to me that it could also be hearing.\n\nAlso do you have your hearing back now? Oh and these are things actual friends who care would ask so cut her loose.", "NTA\nI get the bride feeling her day was ruined or at least not what she expected. But this is the second post tonight where someone had a medical emergency, and the bride held it against them. I have to wonder if the brides in question are narcissists, or if there's some kind of temporary narcissism that befalls brides to be.", "NTA that was just heartless", "NTA   \nDon\u00b4t reach out. Keep her away from your life.", "NTA, not even close! Hope you heal up fast!!", "NTA, absolutely NTA, but I am really curious what was in the bag that made you leave 15 minutes before the ceremony when you are the maid of honour and must have been really busy with the bride at that time. Insulin? The rings? A really delicious sandwich that contained the soul of a lobster?", "NTA\n\nYou. Were. In. A. Car. Accident. And. She\u2019s. More. Worried. About. Her. Wedding. Than. Your. Health.\n\nShe is not your friend. I\u2019m sorry you found out in this most awful (and expensive) of ways.\n\nAnd I hope you\u2019re recovering well/have recovered.", "NTA definition of a self centered bridezilla", "NTA obviously. \n\nI'm guessing her annoyance with you is because she perceives you forgetting something and leaving to get it as you not taking her wedding, and feelings, more seriously.\n\nI have the ADD and this post reminded me of some of my interactions with my now deceased mother. (I miss her everyday, flaws and everything) She could never wrap her head around how I might forget to turn an assignment in, or even an appointment I was supposed to be at. My mom actually thought this was somehow on purpose, maybe I was just trying to make her look bad in some way and not taking things like her feelings more seriously?! \n\nYou literally traveled half way across the country, spent countless hours and countless thousands in support of your BFF. She's now acting like you missed her wedding on purpose in some disrespectful way while you were literally bleeding and deaf in a hospital bed. You wouldn't have even been in her State, that car, or even that situation if it hadn't been for HER weddings.\n\nI see no reason for you to continue your friendship with someone who seems to have forgotten that you literally nearly died as a consequence of wanting to be her MOH", "NTA. Yes it was close to the big moment, but you thought you had time, and you would have made it back without the CAR ACCIDENT that you did not cause. You did so much for her and got paid dust.", "Move to NZ, I'll be your friend, you sound lovely!", "I'm gonna go with ESH.\n\nYou left her wedding to pick up your bag 15 mins before her wedding was supposed to start. I get that it's your bag, but it was not going anywhere. It could have waited. If it was that crucial to have, you could have picked it up after the ceremony before the reception started. So you kinda suck for that. I am by no means saying that you're completely to blame. You got into a traffic accident, and that happens. I can completely understand her anger. Even without the traffic accident, you risked being late because you just had to have your bag. \n\nWhile I can understand her anger, she should have been more sympathetic. She sucks for that. \n\nYou are just as much in the wrong in this situation as she is. You left right before the start time to get a bag that really isn't important. Unless you have life-saving medication in it, of course.", "YTA you shouldn\u2019t have left the ceremony 15 minutes before it was about to start.

Tell her everything you did for her, that you are appalled that she haven't been in touch even though you were in a major car accident and who the F she think she is by treating you like crap. That your friendship is over unless she gives a heartfelt apology. \n\nIf she blows you off, drag her on social media and show the reciepts. Show people screenshots of conversations. Call or text her family. It would be right since your friendship is already over.\n\nI mean, if she wants to burn your friendship, why not make it a bonfire.\n\nNTA", "NTA. That you were in an extremely physically traumatic crash and rather than concern she expressed annoyance is mind-blowing. That would be terrible behavior regardless, but after everything you put in to try and make this a wonderful event for her, that stings.", "NTA. You did everything you could and then got into an accident that wasn't your fault. Continue on your path to wellness, friends like her are only going to cause you to stress as you heal. Good luck with your recovery.", "I wear hearing aids and was born with a 60% hearing loss. Airbags deploy at 1700 decibels, my Audiologists and Dr's suspect that my hearing aids amplified them even more overwhelming my ear drums. They expect them to \"reset \" but they haven't fully yet. I'm still very impaired, less sensitive to sound but my cell phone, car chimes and doorbell don't sound the same yet. I really hope they recover fully. \nAgreed and thank you.", "Haha! A change of clothes, my makeup and comfortable shoes to change into after the photos.", "Personally I feel \"left to get bag right before wedding\" is nowhere near an asshole move as \"getting upset and giving the cold shoulder to someone who got into a severe car accident\" not even close. Had op not gotten into the crash we don't know whether she would've been late or not. It's not even an asshole move, just a dumb one. NTA", "Yeah. It really gives the bride to ignore Op after the accident...\nThis friendship is over, this woman never cared about OP.", "Thank you for answering this. I didn't want to come off as \"can I use your horrible situation to learn something new\" but it didn't occur to me that airbags were loud . Now that you explained it I feel dumb for not knowing that. \n\nFingers crossed that everything goes back to how it was and you make better caring friends along the way \u2764\ufe0f", "I mean you are NTA because of her behavior but all of that could have waited until the lag time between pictures and the reception festivities. You were the MOH so no leaving right before the ceremony, especially not for a bag of wants, not needs."]}
