This is the time you needed to be there for the bride as MOH. What was in your bag that was so important? Unless it was the wedding rings you should have waited until after the ceremony.

And yes she is an AH too for not checking on you.", "ESH obviously she should care more about your well-being but what in the world was going through your mind when you decided to leave the venue 15 minutes before the ceremony for non-essential items?

And OP was the maid of honor! Unless that bag contained much needed medicine or the actual rings for the ceremony, there was no need to risk delaying the wedding like that. This is purely speculation, but someone HAD to have tried to stop/dissuade the MOH from running a 15-minute errand 15 minutes before the wedding ceremony begins, so she would have had to deliberately disregard them. So the bride was probably preemptively pissed at her before the accident even occurred.\n\nThe fact that OP didn't admit that leaving to get her bag was completely unnecessary leads me to believe she's an unreliable narrator. If you learned that two people were in a car crash and one of them was a MOH rushing to get back to a wedding, which would *you* believe was responsible for the accident? I sincerely hope OP is telling the truth about not causing the accident.", "ESH. I'm sorry you got into an accident but you did not need to leave the wedding to get your bag.

No matter how close the house was, you risked being late to the wedding.\n\nThe bride sucks for not checking up on you but it sounds like she is also ready to end the friendship over this. You were MOH and left the wedding.  This may have been enough for her to be mad without the accident. She may also be processing it poorly.

Secondly, let\u2019s be honest here, if you were not rushing and speeding, you would not have got into an accident.  Defensive driving is a thing you know.  Do you know how many times someone has rushed to turn left right in front of me, almost causing a head-to-head collision? I pay attention and slow down immediately if there\u2019s even a possibility someone might turn in front of me.  You were late to the wedding and were driving fast.\n\nYou have to drive for yourself and other around you.

So, she might have been stressed out from her wedding day (with the worry for you and conflicting needs to help you vs. host both families) and exhausted the day after when she came to see you.

Maybe you couldn't hear well, and she did actually say some nice things. Maybe you were on painkillers and sore and winced when she might have tried to hug you or touch you when she saw you. Maybe she was in the midst of a wild hangover or emotionally wrung out from the ceremony (maybe there was drama at the wedding or reception that you're unaware of). Just saying, your perception of that brief meeting might be different from hers. Maybe she thought you were angry at her about having the accident while helping her. Hey, guilt and feelings aren't always logical.\n\nSide note: I enjoyed my wedding day but felt it was a HUGE hosting responsibility--making sure that all of my guests were having a good time, trying to deal with a wild combo of family dynamics, making sure my partner (a fellow introvert) was having a good time while we tried to steal a few minutes to ourselves. It was a great day but it was an exhausting one.\n\nOk, back on track to your friend.

Hey, guilt and feelings aren't always logical.\n\nAs to not checking in on you in the few weeks after the wedding--this is probably one of the busiest times in people's lives. You probably have a honeymoon where you're trying to go off the grid. Say that's 7-10 days plus travel on both ends. You're wrapping up all the wedding business--dealing with any details with vendors, sorting out any family drama, people messaging you to ask about lost and found items (seriously, they do that--I had over 1,000 texts and chats when I opened my phone at the end of my honeymoon and most were related to someone's lost inhaler, or a mistake on a hotel bill--you get the drift). You might be moving, you're probably going back to work and catching up on an avalanche of work after being out for your wedding and honeymoon. \n\nGive her a pass on not reaching out, especially if her perception of your interaction the day after her wedding is different than yours. If she said some kind words or offered an apology that you didn't hear. If she felt guilty about your accident and thought you were angry with her when you were in pain and on meds. \n\nI'm not saying what she did was ok, but give her the benefit of the doubt. She's human and probably dealing with things you're not aware of. Very few people go out of their way to be AH's to others. We are usually in our own drama and unkind or unappreciative because of our own limitations--not because we want to hurt someone. Reach out and be honest about how you feel. Don't give up on a long friendship over what might be a misunderstanding. Give her the chance to do better and make it up to you.", "NTA - I don't know how many people have done last minute errands prior to a wedding ceremony, but thousands do, so the accident and you leaving are non-issues.

I am sorry you had to go through that and I hope your recovery goes well.", "Info: It seems like people are glossing over this: why did you need to get your bag 15 minutes before the wedding?", "NTA for missing the wedding because you were in an accident.\n\nI think you made a poor choice to leave 15 minutes before the ceremony to get something you did not need for the ceremony. It seems like you did not check with the bride before you left. You were the maid of honor. I understand the house was only a mile away but it was too close to the starting time of the ceremony as someone with a major part to be running around. If you had not gotten hurt and were just late because you got stuck in traffic then you would have been the asshole. If I were the bride I would have been upset that you left at that time. \n\nIt may be that there are a lot of complicated emotions. When you care about someone and they get hurt while being kind of dumb you might feel anger along with your fear and concern.  This is your best friend of 17 years who was getting married that day. Maybe they had a lot going on and made some poor responses just like you made a poor choice that day. Maybe you want to try to talk after a bit.", "NTA. I'm just a lurker here but for what it's worth, if this had happened to my BFF on the day of my wedding, I would've apologized to my guests, said enjoy the party, and gone to be with you, (my wife says she would've done the same - screw the cost. We'd have just done a small ceremony later or gotten married in court if we couldn't afford). You were seriously hurt and could have died. Your best friend should have cared enough to at least understand why you couldn't be there!", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t seriously injured and hope you are feeling much better now.\n\nI\u2019d hold off on making a firm decisions right now - not because you aren\u2019t completely justified in not wanting to speak to her again, but because you went through something quite scary and upsetting just 2.5 weeks ago. You are likely still quite shaken up and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to *yourself* to add-on the pressure of deciding whether or not to permanently sever a long-term friendship. \n\nAnd, to be *completely* fair, she might be recognizing that she\u2019s having a very selfish response to what happened and is choosing to distance herself rather than risk expressing those feelings. That still wouldn\u2019t make it right, at all, but her lack of contact may not be *entirely* malicious. Her wedding didn\u2019t go as expected in a pretty big way, which sucks, and perhaps in her mind she\u2019s trying to accept that without saying anything she\u2019ll regret down the line. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not still squarely in the wrong here, because she certainly is!\n\nAll of that said, she\u2019s shown you that *right now* she is not going to give you the care and consideration you need from her. And that\u2019s reason enough to distance yourself from this friendship. You don\u2019t need to decide what the future of this friendship looks like, just that as it stands today, you don\u2019t need to push yourself to put in effort that isn\u2019t being reciprocated.", "NTA. She showed you who she is- listen to her. Let the friendship go quietly. I hope you have recovered & are okay.", "Oh, OP\u2026 first of all, I\u2019m so sorry to hear about your accident and your slow recovery (according to your comments). I\u2019ve never been in a car accident but I can imagine that you\u2019re dealing with a lot of physical *and* emotional trauma right now. On top of that, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s heartbreaking to realize that your \u201cBFF\u201d is\u2026 well, bluntly speaking, a \u201cbad fake friend.\u201d\n\nYou sound like a really, really good friend who is loyal, incredibly generous, and dedicated. I have no idea what your financial circumstances look like but, even as a single person on a fairly high income, the idea of flying *five people* cross-country makes my wallet weep. Unfortunately, it sounds like the people in your life have taken advantage of your good traits. I understand that weddings are expensive and important to the couple getting married but they\u2019re also a day to celebrate the people in your life who support your love. The fact that your \u201cBFF\u201d wasn\u2019t IMMEDIATELY concerned is appalling on a human level. The fact she hasn\u2019t bothered to check in or thank you for everything you\u2019ve done is utterly unforgivable. Cut her out of your life with zero regrets. She\u2019s shown her true colors and they\u2019re hideous. I hope you feel better soon. NTA.", "NTA\n\n\nLost a long term BFF in a similarly selfish ghosting way. It hurts I won't sugarcoat it, I still miss her and it's been 3 years since we last spoke. Don't let this prevent you from being a good friend in the future.\n\nI hope you're recovering from the accident as well as possible. And I hope your emotional hurt passes too.", "NtAH but the bride is.  Regardless of why you left the wedding - you were in a serious accident, and she has showed no concern.  You could send a text or letter regarding how you feel but I figure it will not mean much.", "NTA \n\nWhenever you have some statement of what occurred in detail for the accident, send it to her.", "NTA. Cut her off.", "NTA.  You're lucky to be alive and walked away (banged up) from that accident.   Drop 'friend ' like a hot potato.  She's mad because her plan wasn't about your friendship that day but your working to use your skills to give her the dream wedding. \nHer complete lack of care and concern is sickening.   Anyone comes to you to complain,  share this thread.", "NTA. Let her go. She isn't your friend anymore. If she would happen to sincerely apologize then I would reconsider. But as it stands..let her go.", "NTA.  Bridezillas after the fact.  You were in a car accident - screw her.  She\u2019s not worth it.\nI\u2019d send her a letter telling her that you were so pleased with how grateful she was for all the hard work and expense you put into making her wedding day a success.  And you are so sorry that you had the audacity to be in a serious car accident and miss the wedding you out so much time, effort and expense into.\nThen be sure to thank her for the concern she exhibited over your injuries because it was so comforting and thoughtful.  Honestly, this is exactly what I would do. When I wrote letters to suppliers, they called these my poison pen letters.  Do this and cut all contact with this woman! This is the real her.", "Eh, why make that much effort? Send her the link so she knows not only how OP feels but how hundreds of strangers feel about her behavior.", "I agree. Reddit will tell you to cut them off without communication but I find that to be a cop out. Let them know how you feel and proceed from there. This way you will be at peace knowing you've closed the door on that friendship whether they choose to respond or not.", "Yeah sorry but if my MOH was in a car accident on my wedding day I'd be so worried about them! That's one of my besties! Not to mention she's far away from home and having to deal with it all herself?? I'd show up to the hospital in my freaking wedding dress. I'm so sorry that happened and you're defs NTA!!", "It sounds to me like this bride can\u2019t accept circumstances out of her control, so she is blaming OP for leaving the venue to begin with. This is basically a case of someone who can\u2019t accept that sometimes shit just happens.", "It wasn't a medical emergency though, she left 15 minutes beforehand to drive a mile away for some spare clothes.", "Agreed. The accident was completely avoidable if she didn\u2019t leave 15 minutes before the ceremony. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s doable, other than sneaking out. Every wedding I\u2019ve been in-we were lining up, making sure our makeup and hair still good, etc. And what if it wasn\u2019t an accident but something else held you up, causing ceremony be be delayed. Weddings are on a tight schedule.", "Spare clothes apparently", "It doesn\u2019t matter.  She was in a car accident.", "Agreed. Can believe I\u2019m not seeing more ESH. Yea the accident sucks, but completely avoidable If she didn\u2019t leave 15 min before ceremony started.", "You\u2019re really blaming her for an accident?? Like wtf?? She didn\u2019t EXPECT the accident to happen. She didn\u2019t fucking do it on purpose. She said the house was less than a mile away so she probably assumed it would take like 10 mins to go and be back and not be a problem. And how dare you compare it to the actions of the bride who was happy to accept all the expenses and hard work put in by OP to make the big day special for her friend. Does it suck it happened? Absolutely. But that in no way excuses the brides behavior of not even fucking checking in on her friend. These things are not comparable at all", "Am I missing context here? Bc what I got from your comment was a bride being playful, saying the equivalent of we have the rest of our lives to celebrate (which I interpret as this day is just a day and it's okay to miss it), and then saying they hope you feel better. THEN on the day of her wedding, having the thoughtfulness to have someone send you pictures so you could still feel included.\n\nI mean unless I completely misinterpreted the \"we have another 30 years to celebrate\" comment, I'm not seeing the issue there", "Nta", "NTA. Her first concern is why you went back to the house and not your health and well being now? Yo, I question that too.", "LOVE this idea!!", "Blaming OP for putting herself into a position to get into the car accident.", "Just thinking about this gives me anxiety and my wedding was almost ten years ago.  I would totally be leaving the stupid wedding and making sure my friend was okay.", "Make matters worse this is America. The medical bills is a horror and i hope insurance/other person covers it", "Obviously the medical emergency is referring to getting hit by a fucking car.", "This changes nothing", "That's why OP isn't necessarily an asshole. They just suck. It was really dumb to leave 15 mins before the start time. Like the bag only really had stiff that OP would need after the ceremony anyway. So it could have absolutely waited until after the ceremony and before the reception.", "It really depends, to me. Why was the bag so important? Did she tell anyone she was leaving or where she was going? Or why? We don't even know.", "If I was the bride, I would be fucking upset if my MOH left my wedding because she needed lipstick,", "It absolutely matters. OP left in the first place for no reason.", "I think you're missing the point. The accident has nothing to do with why op sucks. Op sucks bc they left the bride 15 minutes before the wedding for a dumb reason. Tbh even if the accident didn't happen and op left 15 minutes before the wedding and came back, they would still be the AH.", "We\u2019re only getting OP\u2019s POV.  She was rushing and driving fast bc she was late to the wedding.  Defensive driving is a thing you know.  Do you know how many times someone has rushed to turn left right in front of me, almost causing a head-to-head collision? I pay attention and slow down immediately if there\u2019s even a possibility someone might turn in front of me.  \n\nYou have to drive for yourself and other around you.  If she wasn\u2019t speeding and rushing, she would have braked in time and there would be no accident .", "I was in an accident where the airbags deployed and it is horrible. There is a tremendous bang, the bag explodes in your face (I had a bloody nose and powder burns on my face), and the car descends into darkness from the powder. The airbag saved me from serious injury but they are not pleasant.", "Exactly, I agree that the bride is being an asshole for not showing any concern about OP's health and recovery, and for the shady IG posts so NTA.\n\nBut there was no need to leave 15 minutes before the ceremony. At that point you should be ready and helping the bride to get to the hall/chapel/whatever, the guests were probably already there. Also, let's be real, the drama of the MOH not showing up and then getting the news that she's been in a car crash and is being taken to the hospital must have completely overshadowed the wedding. Even if I was a guest from the groom's side who never met OP, it would've totally ruined the mood for me. And the couple must have spent a lot of money and time to organize the wedding, of course, the emotions are high.", "Easy to say now as hindsight is always 20/20.", "Not to mention believing that she could reach her destination and back in under 15 minutes. If you are driving, that literally is not going to happen. Even had she not been in the accident, she was still going to delay the wedding, which is a pretty crappy thing to do for stuff she needs AFTER the service.", "Glad you're okay! I guess considering the alternative, it's a small price to pay. It never occured to me to research how they actually work until seeing OPs post.", "This is terrible. You're blaming her for being in an accident. I'm sure OP has already run thru a million what if scenarios that would have possibly prevented the accident. It was an accident. She's not responsible for being in an accident. Unless she ran a red light/stop sign or was speeding or something.", "Depends whether she already had/could borrow makeup, really. If I'd shown up to the last wedding I was in without makeup on they would still be looking for my remains.", "Do you offer your \u201cview the future\u201d services for free, or for a fee?  You must be $$$ if you charge for it.", "Y\u2019all, it\u2019s not like she PLANNED to get into an accident, Jesus. Hindsight really is 20/20. I\u2019m sure she would have made a different decision had she known the outcome, she figured she had enough time to run home and grab her bag and be back. Does it suck that it overshadowed the day? Yes. But u know what? I would way rather have my friend alive and just be so happy she was OK. Don\u2019t blame the MOH at all. How dare the bride not give a shit about her best friend doing all the work that went into the day and then not even fucking checking on her once she found out", "Thank you!", "I don't think they're blaming her for being in the accident, just for driving off (as maid of honor, no less!) with 15 minutes to spare before the ceremony. Even in the event that no accident happened, it's just risky (in terms of being late) and inconsiderate.", "I didn't see anyone blaming her for the accident.  She definitely deserves sympathy here and her BFF isn't being supportive.  But it's hard to ignore the fact that the MOH left the wedding venue 15 minutes before the ceremony.  Best case scenario you've got the MOH arriving back at the venue five minutes before the wedding starts?  That's crazy.\n\nOP couldn't have predicted being in a terrible car accident, but I'm sure her BFF is thinking that none of this would have happened if OP hadn't made the inexplicable decision to jet off 15 minutes before she was supposed to walk down the aisle.", "I didn't mean for it to sound that way. No OP is not at fault for being in an accident. I also failed to mention that OP went above and beyond and apologized. I also see why the bride is upset, why leave the venue for unnecessary items 15 minutes before hand.", "Blaming OP for putting herself into a position to get into the car accident. The MOH should not leave 15 minutes before the ceremony to go run and get unnecessary things.", "I don't think you need \"future sight\" to know that leaving a wedding YOU ARE A PART OF, 15 minutes before it starts is a stupid idea precisely *because* you can't plan for unforeseen happenstances. Op is NTA for getting into an accident, and the BBF is an AH for not even caring that she was severely hurt, but leaving was still not a wise move, and was entirely in OP's control.", "You don't need to see the future to know that driving a mile away to get a bag of stuff that you absolutely don't need 15 minutes before a very important ceremony that you are heavily involved in is a bad idea.", "It\u2019s not about the accident. Don\u2019t leave 15 minutes before the ceremony unless something is on fire, because anything could happen and hold your friends wedding up. Bad traffic, road closures, etc. she deserves full compassion for getting hurt.", "I would be willing to blame OP for the accident if she was rushing."]}
