{"id": 32723, "submission_id": "18es52d", "title": "AITA for confronting the owner of the cat shelter I volunteer at after overhearing her insult me in a phone call?", "selftext": "I started volunteering at a cat shelter a month ago. The owner has very few volunteers helping with cleaning the whole place, feeding, sorting food and donations, ecc., so I accepted to join and stay, doing double shifts (sacrificing my own job too!) like everybody else.\n\nI was given the keys to manage the shelter independently at the end of the past month, and since then, I admit, I had a few issues and worked more slowly, mostly because I was suddenly expected to do everything on my own (cleaning a house with porch, garden, roof) quickly (in 3 hours). Naturally I became slower, as I only am one person, and more tired as the double shifts accumulated.\n\n I was late twice and forgot my keys once, which I apologized for, acknowledged, and was ready to improve my performance. I made lots of other small mistakes that were never repeated once corrected.\n\nToday, I entered the shelter on time, with my own keys, and heard the owner loudly talk shit about me to someone else. She said I must be mentally slow (she used a particular insult in my language that means roughly the r-word), and that I must have psychiatric issues too since I take sleep aids (which I told her about because she specifically asked me for recommendations, as she also has this problem) and that i'm too old to be this mentally challenged and not work as independently as she'd like, and too young to take psychiatric medication, \"is she stupid? how bad can you have it at 30 to be taking that?\". She just went on for a few minutes, listing all my mistakes and saying i'm r-word.\n\nI just stood there, unsure of whether or not to announce my presence. Eventually I did and she cut the call off, she didn't understand whether I had heard and started being nice to me.\n\nI worked my shift for the sake of the cats; I knew I'd miss them badly, but I couldn't let myself be disrespected like that. Had she told me all of this to my face and asked me why my performance was so poor, I would have gladly taken the input and worked harder, because I'm aware that I'm forgetful and often need very literal indications to do things, especially for the first time. I was having trouble adjusting.\n\nIn the end, I told her to take back her keys because today would be my last day here, since she insulted me like that. She was expressionless and said \"you know I can be very rough with anyone, it's just how I am\". \n\nI told her that she could have just confronted me about it like a normal person. She didn't even say sorry, she went on to say that my initial performance was better and that now i'm slow and distracted and she was disappointed.\n\nI told her I can't accept being disrespected like this, since she didn't even apologize. She saw me off with a passive aggressive \"Bye\" and I replied \"Good luck.\" I won't be going anymore.\n\nI feel a bit insane because I know I left the two other volunteers in a though spot and I'm going to miss the cats I bonded with like crazy, I don't know if I've been too impulsive.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702171040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18es52d/aita_for_confronting_the_owner_of_the_cat_shelter/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anytime somebody says that, what they\u2019re actually saying is that they know they\u2019re an asshole, they just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s a ridiculous deflection, a pathetic attempt to blame other people for their own poor behavior. You were absolutely right to confront her about this, and she is absolutely the asshole. I also understand feeling bad for leaving the other volunteers with a bigger workload, but that isn\u2019t on you. You aren\u2019t obligated to tolerate such personal disrespect for them. The reason their workload is heavier is because the boss treated you poorly, not because you left.", "NTA\n\nWell we\u2019ve discovered why there\u2019s a lack of volunteers.

Being condescending and nasty about you behind your back. Pretty obvious one.\n2  Being a really poor manager for amping up the work load for a volunteer and doesn't mind them to sacrifice in other facets of their lives in order to keep her shelter afloat. She should be gratefull for any free labour she can get.\n\nThe whole \"that's how i am\" spiel is such a bs argument. Had that one tossed at me once too, she didn't find the response: \"Being condescending towards me pisses me off, that's just how i am\" to be reasonable. Just let her eat the consequences of her behaviour. I know the cats aren't to blame for any of it but there are several other ways you can help animals if you want to, can't save them all just by yourself so don't beat yourself up over it. If the cats do suffer from the lack of people caring for them you can always see if there are any authorities you can inform on the conditions there.", "This is even more true of dog people. They only care about dogs and not about people at all."]}
