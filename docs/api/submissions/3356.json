Around this time last year my parents asked me if I wanted to come over for Christmas. I told them sure, I live abroad so I don't see them very often. The plan was for me to arrive December 22nd and go back on on January 7.\n\nOur relationship was very rocky when I was a child due to my dad's mental health and anger issues, but he's in therapy for that now. I'm in therapy as well for the diagnosed PTSD that his issues have given me. This will be relevant later.\n\nI bought myself a round-trip train ticket ($150) for the long ride home as I don't have a car and have really bad plane anxiety. Around December 15th my mom called and asked me if I could bring back some of those cookies that she loves and I tell her of course. I decided to get them on the 21st so they're still super fresh upon arrival. I also bought some breads and sweets for my siblings. The total came down to about $40. I'm a student and due to my chronic illness and heart condition I can't work a lot so money is tight and I had to take some money out of my savings for this to afford all of it, but I didn't mind.\n\nFast forward to the evening of the 21st. I'm on the phone with my dad telling him that I got the cookies mom asked for and that I have to get up at 7 to get to the train station and that I'm super excited to see them again. \n\nOut of nowhere he tells me that won't be necessary because he and my mom are leaving for some island in the Caribbean the next day. I ask him how long they've been planning this for and he told me that they decided two days prior. I asked him if they could cancel because I thought we'd already established that I would be coming over and he says no. He then says I should be more understanding because mom has fibromyalgia and the cold makes her pain worse and the heat will make it better.\n\nAfter that I called my mom and I'm going to be honest here, I said some really unkind things and called her a selfish bitch (among other things) for making me spend nearly $200 and have me go through all that effort only for them cancel on me last-minute. I demanded an apology and a full pay-back of all the money. Apparently that hurt her feelings and she hasn't talked to me all year. My dad then called me and said that he had a talk with his therapist and that his therapist told him ignore my angry outburst and not give in to my demands because, quote, \"people with PTSD can't think rationally\". \n\nThis morning I woke up to a text from my dad asking me if I want to come over for the holidays, no cancellations this time. I told him to fuck off until they both apologize for cancelling on me last year, for the thing he said about my PTSD, and to pay me back for last year. He refused to and gave me a written lecture that I'm just holding just a grudge and should get over it because it was, quote, \"a misunderstanding\" and \"we're family\", but I absolutely refuse to and I told him to not text me again unless it's an apology.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669561474, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z63ddm/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_wont_spend_the/", "score": 1327, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like your dad's therapist isn't a good one and gives him selfish advice (assuming he was completely honest with them about what happened). It's pretty obvious that your parents are still bad for your mental health and you'd be better off being completely no contact with them indefinitely.", "NTA.\n\nYou are under NO obligation to spend time with the family that caused your PTSD and are still giving you emotional whiplash to this day.  \n\nI think it's time to discuss with your therapist whether you should go no contact with them for now and focus on your own health.", "NTA.  Your parents need some serious therapy on how to be parents.  Treat yourself to a nice holiday elsewhere. Good luck.", "NTA at all. What your fathers therapist\u2019s supposedly said sounds made up to shut you down.", "NTA they are just really bad at parenting and at being nice humans, create your on friendship family. Most likely they will always feel they can do this sort of thing to you and that you should accommodate under the guise of being family", "NTA. I have fibromyalgia, joint issues, and chronic fatigue, so I understand the pain and cold making it worse. Their trip would have made more sense if they didn't cancel on you last minute. And sometimes we have to suck up the pain and try to see family, even for one night. Yeah, it can really suck for us. But that doesn't mean I get to just leave someone hanging like that, especially after they spent money, *and* during the holidays.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't go either. Sure, maybe you said some things that weren't nice, but that's what happens when they do something like that to you. They also owe you an apology.", "NTA. Your response was right. You will never have a healthy relationship with these AH.", "NTA - I wouldn't waste my time. As for you holding a \"grudge\" over this, they're acknowledging they did you dirty and they know it. They didn't give a shit about you then, drop the rope. I speak to neither of my parents and my mental health is better for it.", "NTA What they did is completely wrong and showed how much they really wanted yo see you.  Keep standing your ground.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to refund anything, but I also wouldn\u2019t make an plans involving them for a long time. I\u2019m sorry, OP. I know that must have been really hurtful. You didn\u2019t deserve that.", "NTA, they screwed you over for absolutely no reason and have been trying to make you take the blame for it ever since. Honestly if I were in the same boat, unless they covered all the expenses themselves AND apologised for their selfish actions, I personally wouldn't even think about going. At best they would get a text Christmas day, and I'd enjoy the day by myself.", ">mom has fibromyalgia and the cold makes her pain worse and the heat will make it better\n\nFibromyalgia didn't happen overnight, and I doubt they were having summer-weather until two days before your trip. They acted on a whim and didn't think about you at all until you brought it up. Your inconvenience meant nothing, they insulted the issues THAT THEY CAUSED and paint themselves as the victims - that's not a misunderstanding. That's being self-centered, borderline narcissistic and unworthy of your time, OP.\n\nNTA. If you don't rely on them to live, I'd go on a very low/no contact.", "Don't back down on this! How utterly selfish and cruel to make you go to all that effort to just book a holiday. What on earth!!! Do they even care if you had back up plans? If you could afford losing that money? Of course they owe it to you and why should you be talking to them. They care only for themselves.", "NTA and to quote ' a family of assholes will continue to do so even if the therapists say otherwise'. Why in the world would you even want to go visit them after the way they treated you. Even if you got an apology and money, the visit would still be shit and it will end up the same way. Focus on your life and don't get sucked into the toxic shit thats at home. When a couple after making plans with a child can ignore him/ her to make plans for going on a vacation 2 days before Christmas, their priorities are definitely in the wrong order. Its not worth spending any time with them, at least over special times of the year unless you want more unhappy memories to remember.", "NTA. I get the feeling that OP's dad's therapist is getting a heavily edited version of what happened. I'm kind of sympathetic about the fibromyalgia thing here. I don't know much about it but wouldn't rule out the possibility that it might have flared up at the last minute. OTOH, I agree that OP is entitled to an apology and some money back. Your parents seem to feel that having birthed you and raised you, however inadequately, that you're some kind of appendage and forever in their debt. Obviously that's nonsense. I would go lc and try resetting the relationship. This might take some time. I personally am not in favour of going nc in family situations because I'm old school and feel that blood ought to be thicker than water. That said, I wouldn't agree to any more arrangements that are this lopsided. If your parents want you to come over fro Xmas, that's nice but they need to front the cost of all travel expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, the apology.", "NTA. You are valid in expecting them to make an effort to mend what they did with more than \"let's just forget about it\". It might be better not to make specific demands but continue to let them know you feel slighted and suffered financially and their nonchalance attitude about it all pains you. Let them decide how they can make it to to you. If they have no interest in making it up,  then their lack of concern  is a valid reason to stay low contact.", "NTA. It would be appropriate to apologize for cursing out your mom. Honestly, I probably wouldn't apologize for it but thats just me. I'd chalk it up to a misunderstanding just like they did withyour trip.  Now , I would stand firm about the change of plans last minute.  I would write off the funds you lost for the trip but I really wouldn't bend over backwards to visit.  It seems as though they more specifically your Dadare playing games with you and you don't need that. You've already have enough issues from dealing with him.   So, be cordial and don't participate in any b.s. he trues to throw at you.  This is the same b.s. that he pulled while you were growing up.  Going lc with your Dad is probably a great choice or NC especially if you are seeing that he is egging you on.  Talk to mom but if she's pulling the same stunts,,I'd low contact or no contact with her as well.  You deserve better. Your parents deserve their misery.", "NTA - your dad let his issues give you issues, that's bad enough.  Clearly he's not actually engaged in or getting anything of value from his \"therapy\".  That line of BS he tried to feed you is standard diversionary crap.  Both your parents were total AHs to make such a big deal out of you coming last year and then blowing you off at the last second.  They do not value you or consider you worthy of respect and you don't need that toxicity in your life.  As I've always said, blood family comes by dumb luck, but you can make a family that is really yours.  Please leave them to their own issues and find/make a family that loves and values you as you deserve.", "Your parents asked you to come for Christmas, and you made definite plans with confirmed dates - 12/22-1/7.\n\nYou talked to your mother on the 15th, and she asked you to bring home a special type of cookie.\n\nOn the 19th, your parents made plans to go to the Carribean for Christmas, which is one of the MOST expensive times to travel there, because your mother's fibromyalgia flared up, **even though they knew you were coming home for Christmas.**\n\nYou found out accidentally when you happened to call the night before you were scheduled to arrive.  They did not apologize or offer to reimburse you.  **Seriously you are NTA**.  This is beyond rude.  If you had not called, you could have shown up there and found no one home.\n\nIt sounds like you had a really rocky childhood if your father's anger issues gave you PTSD.  That trauma is real, and both your parents bear the responsibility for that.  Your father for inflicting his anger on you and your mother for allowing it to happen.  I disagree with the other commenters who say that you need to apologize to your mother.  Sometimes people need to have some hard truths said to them. This is just one more time where she put her needs over those of her child. I say one more time, because my guess is she stayed with your father because it was better for her to do so then to have taken you out of that emotionally and verbally abusive situation.\n\nThe pain from fibromyalgia is real, but she could have toughed it out for a couple of weeks since she knew you were coming. It would also have been cheaper to travel to the Carribean during the second week of January.  If they had the money for the trip, they also had the money to reimburse you.  Your parents are just unbelievable AHs, and I wouldn't spend any holidays with them until they take ownership of what they did and reimburse you.", "How is communicating the plans clearly to your mom (I assume a month or more out...) and her asking you to bring cookies on the 15th... for them to say \"oh we are leaving for Christmas. We decided 2 days ago. Get over it.\" Miscommunication that is your fault? Sounds like his therapist is an idiot. He just heard what he wanted to hear.. or lied to the therapist to get them on his side. \n\nThey decided last minute it was all a you problem. \n\nI'd apologize to your mom... sounds like she is being abused by your dad", "NTA. If I were you, I would not go because it does not sound the issue is resolved and being home would just ruin the holiday for you. Plan something else. I hope someday they will apologize and your relationship get better. What your parents did last year was a total AH thing to do.", "NTA. It\u2019s totally unfair for them to mess you around like that at such short notice, and they need to learn to value your time and money as equally important to theirs. \n\nInteresting that your dad lectured you about grudges while your mum clearly held one if she didn\u2019t talk to you for a year. I doubt his therapist actually said any of that unless they are just a terrible therapist. \n\nYou are entirely justified in holding your ground on this, and it shouldn\u2019t be up to you to mend this bridge.", "NTA - tell them you\u2019ll be there and cancel the day before. Or just say nothing and ghost them.", "NTA. I wouldn't even bother talking with them at this point, they're just as toxic as ever. I'd go NC with them until they decide to apologize to and reimburse you. They even know deep down they screwed you, and the fact they're flinging all the crap at the wall they can to justify it shows they really haven't changed at all.", "NTA.\n\nThere was no \"misunderstanding\". Your parents broke your trust. They aren't trying to earn it back.

They treated you very poorly, booked a trip without bothering to tell you, had you spend money on tickets and treats.  Your dad has a bad therapist too ... the whole thing is a mess.

She would just watch him use me as a punching bag for his anger while I was crying and begging him to stop yelling at me.

She never took any steps to make it stop and part of me understands that she was scared as well, but I also feel bitter about it.", "Also, the comment about your anger because of your ptsd is total b*llshit.

Someone who would watch your back and help you when you need help the most, even if located the other side of the globe, is much more a family than anyone who screws you over and have a \"relationship\" with you.\n\nYou are old enough now, so if anything, I would say at this point the only use of your parents are being your punchbag, if hurting them makes you feel better that is (it certainly did in my case)", "Must be from Einstein.

You don\u2019t owe your parents anything. Their abuse is ongoing. You deserve better.", "I relate to that, but as you said it's only anecdotal on my end too. I'd prefer to just live somewhere warm someday so I could just lay out on a comfortable chair under some shade like a lizard.

I wouldn't really have fun in that condition.", "If you don\u2019t provide the info then we can\u2019t go from it. Based off what you posted above, that\u2019s my assessment.

I always pay my kids airfare.", "I see. But you also called your mother a \u201cselfish bitch\u201d and it sounds like you\u2019re icing out the rest of your family by not going as well (got this from you mentioning getting something for your siblings). So to me I read your post as you saying it\u2019s screw everybody on his account. \n\nYour dad is unquestionably an asshole. But it sounds like him being one provokes you into being one out of hurt, which I\u2019d advise you to be careful about lest you wake up one day, look in the mirror & discover you\u2019re just like him. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your anger isn\u2019t justified. Perhaps even you not going is justified. But the way you described your handling of the situation makes you an asshole imo (perhaps not THE asshole). You could\u2019ve conveyed the same sentiments in a respectful manner that made it clear, \u201cHey, I\u2019d love to go but you guys cancelled on me last minute & that greatly inconvenienced me and it seems you don\u2019t find that to be an issue. So I\u2019m going to opt out of the family gathering this year. Thanks for the invite though.\u201d Or \u201cMom, come on. You know I traveled super far and was looking forward to seeing you guys! I\u2019m really disappointed you cancelled on me last minute. That wasn\u2019t considerate of me at all.\u201d", "I relate to you in many ways. My parents treatment of me conditioned me to respond to hurt with hurt. And over time I ended up hurting other people in life with how I responded to things because of it to the point where I started turning into them. \n\nThat\u2019s why I judged you the way I did because I don\u2019t want to see people diminish their better selves on account of the asshole things others do. That\u2019s why your dad responded the way he did as though you were at fault. Don\u2019t let him off the hook next time by blowing up. People will use your reaction to things you were righteously angry about as a shield to cover the real issues. \n\nIf you hold your composure, you leave them with no way out.

We\u2019re all assholes at some point.", "The reason I called my mom that was because it was her idea, not my dad's. Something about not shooting the messenger. I don't have a lot of money and I am completely financially independent from them. Holiday season is an expensive time of year so sinking $200 into nothing is something I would've preferably not done. If I had known in time that plans were off the table I would've been able to put that money to my bills instead of basically just dumping it into the void. It's not like I could put that train ticket to any use. The fact that she requested those cookies also means that she very well knew that I was coming and that I had secured a ticket. $200 ($175 if you subtract the gifts for my siblings) is a lot of money to spend in one go for anyone, unless you're literally a millionaire. \n\nOn top of that, if I hadn't called my dad to confirm my ETA, I wouldn't have even known they were gone until I was stood in front of a locked door? I found out the night before. So yeah, of course I was very emotional and angry. I wouldn't call her a bitch now, but I do still stand by calling her selfish."]}
