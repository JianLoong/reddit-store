Around this time last year my parents asked me if I wanted to come over for Christmas. I told them sure, I live abroad so I don't see them very often. The plan was for me to arrive December 22nd and go back on on January 7.\n\nOur relationship was very rocky when I was a child due to my dad's mental health and anger issues, but he's in therapy for that now. I'm in therapy as well for the diagnosed PTSD that his issues have given me. This will be relevant later.\n\nI bought myself a round-trip train ticket ($150) for the long ride home as I don't have a car and have really bad plane anxiety. Around December 15th my mom called and asked me if I could bring back some of those cookies that she loves and I tell her of course. I decided to get them on the 21st so they're still super fresh upon arrival. I also bought some breads and sweets for my siblings. The total came down to about $40. I'm a student and due to my chronic illness and heart condition I can't work a lot so money is tight and I had to take some money out of my savings for this to afford all of it, but I didn't mind.\n\nFast forward to the evening of the 21st. I'm on the phone with my dad telling him that I got the cookies mom asked for and that I have to get up at 7 to get to the train station and that I'm super excited to see them again. \n\nOut of nowhere he tells me that won't be necessary because he and my mom are leaving for some island in the Caribbean the next day. I ask him how long they've been planning this for and he told me that they decided two days prior. I asked him if they could cancel because I thought we'd already established that I would be coming over and he says no. He then says I should be more understanding because mom has fibromyalgia and the cold makes her pain worse and the heat will make it better.\n\nAfter that I called my mom and I'm going to be honest here, I said some really unkind things and called her a selfish bitch (among other things) for making me spend nearly $200 and have me go through all that effort only for them cancel on me last-minute. I demanded an apology and a full pay-back of all the money. Apparently that hurt her feelings and she hasn't talked to me all year. My dad then called me and said that he had a talk with his therapist and that his therapist told him ignore my angry outburst and not give in to my demands because, quote, \"people with PTSD can't think rationally\". \n\nThis morning I woke up to a text from my dad asking me if I want to come over for the holidays, no cancellations this time. I told him to fuck off until they both apologize for cancelling on me last year, for the thing he said about my PTSD, and to pay me back for last year. He refused to and gave me a written lecture that I'm just holding just a grudge and should get over it because it was, quote, \"a misunderstanding\" and \"we're family\", but I absolutely refuse to and I told him to not text me again unless it's an apology.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669561474, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z63ddm/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_wont_spend_the/", "score": 4101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like your dad's therapist isn't a good one and gives him selfish advice (assuming he was completely honest with them about what happened). It's pretty obvious that your parents are still bad for your mental health and you'd be better off being completely no contact with them indefinitely.", "NTA.\n\nYou are under NO obligation to spend time with the family that caused your PTSD and are still giving you emotional whiplash to this day.  \n\nI think it's time to discuss with your therapist whether you should go no contact with them for now and focus on your own health.", "NTA.  Your parents need some serious therapy on how to be parents.  Treat yourself to a nice holiday elsewhere. Good luck.", "NTA at all. What your fathers therapist\u2019s supposedly said sounds made up to shut you down.", "NTA they are just really bad at parenting and at being nice humans, create your on friendship family. Most likely they will always feel they can do this sort of thing to you and that you should accommodate under the guise of being family", "NTA. I have fibromyalgia, joint issues, and chronic fatigue, so I understand the pain and cold making it worse. Their trip would have made more sense if they didn't cancel on you last minute. And sometimes we have to suck up the pain and try to see family, even for one night. Yeah, it can really suck for us. But that doesn't mean I get to just leave someone hanging like that, especially after they spent money, *and* during the holidays.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't go either. Sure, maybe you said some things that weren't nice, but that's what happens when they do something like that to you. They also owe you an apology.", "NTA. Your response was right. You will never have a healthy relationship with these AH.", "NTA - I wouldn't waste my time. As for you holding a \"grudge\" over this, they're acknowledging they did you dirty and they know it. They didn't give a shit about you then, drop the rope. I speak to neither of my parents and my mental health is better for it.", "NTA What they did is completely wrong and showed how much they really wanted yo see you.  Keep standing your ground.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to refund anything, but I also wouldn\u2019t make an plans involving them for a long time. I\u2019m sorry, OP. I know that must have been really hurtful. You didn\u2019t deserve that.", "NTA, they screwed you over for absolutely no reason and have been trying to make you take the blame for it ever since. Honestly if I were in the same boat, unless they covered all the expenses themselves AND apologised for their selfish actions, I personally wouldn't even think about going. At best they would get a text Christmas day, and I'd enjoy the day by myself.", ">mom has fibromyalgia and the cold makes her pain worse and the heat will make it better\n\nFibromyalgia didn't happen overnight, and I doubt they were having summer-weather until two days before your trip. They acted on a whim and didn't think about you at all until you brought it up. Your inconvenience meant nothing, they insulted the issues THAT THEY CAUSED and paint themselves as the victims - that's not a misunderstanding. That's being self-centered, borderline narcissistic and unworthy of your time, OP.\n\nNTA. If you don't rely on them to live, I'd go on a very low/no contact.", "Don't back down on this! How utterly selfish and cruel to make you go to all that effort to just book a holiday. What on earth!!! Do they even care if you had back up plans? If you could afford losing that money? Of course they owe it to you and why should you be talking to them. They care only for themselves.", "NTA and to quote ' a family of assholes will continue to do so even if the therapists say otherwise'. Why in the world would you even want to go visit them after the way they treated you. Even if you got an apology and money, the visit would still be shit and it will end up the same way. Focus on your life and don't get sucked into the toxic shit thats at home. When a couple after making plans with a child can ignore him/ her to make plans for going on a vacation 2 days before Christmas, their priorities are definitely in the wrong order. Its not worth spending any time with them, at least over special times of the year unless you want more unhappy memories to remember.", "NTA. I get the feeling that OP's dad's therapist is getting a heavily edited version of what happened. I'm kind of sympathetic about the fibromyalgia thing here. I don't know much about it but wouldn't rule out the possibility that it might have flared up at the last minute. OTOH, I agree that OP is entitled to an apology and some money back. Your parents seem to feel that having birthed you and raised you, however inadequately, that you're some kind of appendage and forever in their debt. Obviously that's nonsense. I would go lc and try resetting the relationship. This might take some time. I personally am not in favour of going nc in family situations because I'm old school and feel that blood ought to be thicker than water. That said, I wouldn't agree to any more arrangements that are this lopsided. If your parents want you to come over fro Xmas, that's nice but they need to front the cost of all travel expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, the apology.", "NTA. You are valid in expecting them to make an effort to mend what they did with more than \"let's just forget about it\". It might be better not to make specific demands but continue to let them know you feel slighted and suffered financially and their nonchalance attitude about it all pains you. Let them decide how they can make it to to you. If they have no interest in making it up,  then their lack of concern  is a valid reason to stay low contact.", "NTA. It would be appropriate to apologize for cursing out your mom. Honestly, I probably wouldn't apologize for it but thats just me. I'd chalk it up to a misunderstanding just like they did withyour trip.  Now , I would stand firm about the change of plans last minute.  I would write off the funds you lost for the trip but I really wouldn't bend over backwards to visit.  It seems as though they more specifically your Dadare playing games with you and you don't need that. You've already have enough issues from dealing with him.   So, be cordial and don't participate in any b.s. he trues to throw at you.  This is the same b.s. that he pulled while you were growing up.  Going lc with your Dad is probably a great choice or NC especially if you are seeing that he is egging you on.  Talk to mom but if she's pulling the same stunts,,I'd low contact or no contact with her as well.  You deserve better. Your parents deserve their misery.", "NTA - your dad let his issues give you issues, that's bad enough.  Clearly he's not actually engaged in or getting anything of value from his \"therapy\".  That line of BS he tried to feed you is standard diversionary crap.  Both your parents were total AHs to make such a big deal out of you coming last year and then blowing you off at the last second.  They do not value you or consider you worthy of respect and you don't need that toxicity in your life.  As I've always said, blood family comes by dumb luck, but you can make a family that is really yours.  Please leave them to their own issues and find/make a family that loves and values you as you deserve.", "Your parents asked you to come for Christmas, and you made definite plans with confirmed dates - 12/22-1/7.\n\nYou talked to your mother on the 15th, and she asked you to bring home a special type of cookie.\n\nOn the 19th, your parents made plans to go to the Carribean for Christmas, which is one of the MOST expensive times to travel there, because your mother's fibromyalgia flared up, **even though they knew you were coming home for Christmas.**\n\nYou found out accidentally when you happened to call the night before you were scheduled to arrive.  They did not apologize or offer to reimburse you.  **Seriously you are NTA**.  This is beyond rude.  If you had not called, you could have shown up there and found no one home.\n\nIt sounds like you had a really rocky childhood if your father's anger issues gave you PTSD.  That trauma is real, and both your parents bear the responsibility for that.  Your father for inflicting his anger on you and your mother for allowing it to happen.  I disagree with the other commenters who say that you need to apologize to your mother.  Sometimes people need to have some hard truths said to them. This is just one more time where she put her needs over those of her child. I say one more time, because my guess is she stayed with your father because it was better for her to do so then to have taken you out of that emotionally and verbally abusive situation.\n\nThe pain from fibromyalgia is real, but she could have toughed it out for a couple of weeks since she knew you were coming. It would also have been cheaper to travel to the Carribean during the second week of January.  If they had the money for the trip, they also had the money to reimburse you.  Your parents are just unbelievable AHs, and I wouldn't spend any holidays with them until they take ownership of what they did and reimburse you.", "How is communicating the plans clearly to your mom (I assume a month or more out...) and her asking you to bring cookies on the 15th... for them to say \"oh we are leaving for Christmas. We decided 2 days ago. Get over it.\" Miscommunication that is your fault? Sounds like his therapist is an idiot. He just heard what he wanted to hear.. or lied to the therapist to get them on his side. \n\nThey decided last minute it was all a you problem. \n\nI'd apologize to your mom... sounds like she is being abused by your dad", "NTA. If I were you, I would not go because it does not sound the issue is resolved and being home would just ruin the holiday for you. Plan something else. I hope someday they will apologize and your relationship get better. What your parents did last year was a total AH thing to do.", "NTA. It\u2019s totally unfair for them to mess you around like that at such short notice, and they need to learn to value your time and money as equally important to theirs. \n\nInteresting that your dad lectured you about grudges while your mum clearly held one if she didn\u2019t talk to you for a year. I doubt his therapist actually said any of that unless they are just a terrible therapist. \n\nYou are entirely justified in holding your ground on this, and it shouldn\u2019t be up to you to mend this bridge.", "NTA - tell them you\u2019ll be there and cancel the day before. Or just say nothing and ghost them.", "NTA. I wouldn't even bother talking with them at this point, they're just as toxic as ever. I'd go NC with them until they decide to apologize to and reimburse you. They even know deep down they screwed you, and the fact they're flinging all the crap at the wall they can to justify it shows they really haven't changed at all.", "NTA.\n\nThere was no \"misunderstanding\". Your parents broke your trust. They aren't trying to earn it back.

They treated you very poorly, booked a trip without bothering to tell you, had you spend money on tickets and treats.  Your dad has a bad therapist too ... the whole thing is a mess.

Our aim is to guide people to learn themselves, it's literally in Therapist training that we are not supposed to give out ADVICE (like this anyway)\n\nHowever yes, some therapists are utterly bad as well. Or say the wrong thing, or aren't experienced or trained enough and can get things terribly wrong whether it's through a screwed perspective, bias or just incompetence.\n\nPeople in therapy just need to remember that Therapists word isn't law or always correct in every situation. And it definitely shouldn't be weaponized like this seems to have been. Sounds like Dad hasn't made as much progress as he might think if he is trying to use his therapists words like this.", "I am personally betting the therapist said no such thing, and that was just what the dad chose to \"hear.\" This is why therapy doesn't work well on abusers-- they don't take responsibility for their actions, and instead learn to use the language of therapy to more convincingly lay the blame on others.", "No,  therapy doesn't work if people aren't willing to work at it.   However,  someone needs to give a little effort first to see if you get a result.   If it still doesn't work, then you write them off.  The problem is that the therapy doesn't appear to be working on him anymore than his parents.   They are all being petty.  \nI'd rather try at least to patch things up if possible with my family than wire them off right up front.   \nI honestly think we'll just have to agree to disagree.", "No the person needs to want to change to be able to change. This saviour complex needs to be put to rest . If after years of trauma the situation isn\u2019t changing then maybe it\u2019s time to learn to let go instead of clinging to fantasies.", "I would make the 1.5 hour drive to my mom's once every other month or so (even in my 30s) and she would still slip $40 in my purse for gas money lol. I can't imagine having enough money for a last minute Christmas flight/hotel in the Caribbean but not $200 to cover your child's trip home.", "NTA but...\n\nYou have a choice. Either let one act of selfishness ruin your relationship with your parents forever or forget about it.\n\nIn this case, yta because its the better person who forgives when they don't need to.\n\nMy advice? Forget it, go and see your parents because you never know when they'll be gone.", "Therapist part is a lie. Therapist would Hold them accountable even if he has PTSD.", "I am so very sorry for you, OP. Your parents are abusive, and for your mental health (and your budget) please go NC. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. You are not holding a grudge, you have objective reasons to be angry and disappointed by your parents' behavior. You do NOT deserve that mistreatment.\n\nTalk to your therapist, but I don't see how you can keep relationships alive when clearly your parents abuse you. I wonder if your siblings are not lied about your situation. You might need to go LC with them.\n\nPlease remember that family is the group of people who care about you, want to spend time with you and have your back.", "These people are NEVER honest with their therapists, they are not even honest with themselves.", "You just described Lucifer, honestly. Linda everytime he twisted her words to the point, she just gave up on trying to get him to listen lol", "Oh jeez sorry about that. What a mind f$&k from your parents. I hope that you have a great Christmas with friends this year.", "Exactly. Therapists aren't supposed to \"tell\" their clients what to do. It's an ethics violation. They help the client understand what their ideal life looks like and the steps they need to undertake to get there. And no therapist would tell a client to just ignore something that big. Maybe table it for another time if the client can'thandle it just now, but not ignore and certainly not for their bullshit reasoning.\n\nSo either it's a shitty therapist, or dad's a fucking liar.\n\nSource: am therapist.", "See! You\u2019re a good parent!", "NTA. You deserve an apology and for them to make the effort to travel to you.", "ESH.\nYes, they should have given you a heads up and for that, they are jerks.

These people may have birthed you, but they are not family.", "NTA obviously, BUT holding out for an apology isn\u2019t going to work. I would want to be paid back though but they aren\u2019t going to apologize. And it won\u2019t be genuine if they do. If you want to go, I would just tell them you would visit but only on their dime this time. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like you aren\u2019t missing out on much as far as a relationship with them goes. Obviously they still have a lot of work to do on themselves before they are capable of a strong parent-child relationship. If you aren\u2019t interested in going, don\u2019t feel obligated to do so. Let them figure their stuff out and reevaluate later.", "NTA", "NTA, and NO they aren't Family they are Blood, the difference is Important.  Family is an honorary title built on love, care, and respect.  Shockingly people who aren't assholes don't try and justify shit behavior using others medical issues as an excuse for why what they did \"wasn't that bad\", be done with them.  You're in therapy because one of them couldn't take responsibility for himself and the other enabled his behavior, do you really want to test whether they can make your issues Worse?", "NTA and I\u2019d guess that the dad gave a very edited version to his therapist or really twisting the advice was given", "My mom's therapist told her to write a letter to my estranged sister telling her how hurt she is that they can't talk and work out their issues. Then my mom was supposed to seal the letter up and either burn it or put it away in a drawer..... that's what the therapist *told* her to do.\n\nThis is what she *actually* did: she wrote a letter telling my sister everything was all my sister's fault and she was a \"bitch.\" Then she actually mailed it to my sister. I later learned my sister threw it away without reading it. Thank goodness. \n\nWhen I asked my mom why she would do such a thing when the therapist was so clear, she said, \"He told me to express my feelings and I thought about it and I was mad. Then I figured it was a waste of effort to write it and not mail it.\"", "Alright.

You're far better off without them. NTA.", "NTA. It's understandable you want an apology, what your parents did last year is not ok. I feel like they should even reimburse your expenses since it's their fault last year got cancelled. Since they hardly seem to understand that what they did was not ok, it's also understandable you don't want to go through this whole ordeal again.", "NTA. Your parents suck.

We are family is a two way street. Remember him this", "NTA", "NTA, wow your parents are extremely selfish, you are right, and whatever his therapist is telling him is based on his attitude likely and is probably taken out of context, OR it's a bad therapist.", ">Telling your dad a year later \"Eff off!\" is just keeping the bad vibes in place.\n\nBad vibe? well, Christ, Daddy-O, maybe OP would chill out if they could groove with an apology and dance to the tune of $200  \n\n\nCause' I don't think 'Walk Over Me' is their jam", "I moved to Cambodia in my 30s and my parents still paid for me to come home at Christmas.
