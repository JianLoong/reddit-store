Trying to brain dump everything so I really can know if I am in the wrong. \n\nMe (f,28) and my boyfriend (m,28) have our 3 year anniversary tomorrow and I am 100% sure he has forgotten. Over the past few years we have always planned something special for our anniversary, even though it always falls the same week of thanksgiving. This year there has been NO mention of any sort of celebration at all. \nI do feel like I have to mention; we did buy his family plane tickets to come and celebrate with us for thanksgiving this year. Knowing this, I knew we wouldn\u2019t be doing anything extravagant for our day but was hoping for at least dinner. All he has talked about over the past few weeks is about how excited he is for them to come out, as am I. I understand family trumps all, but after 3 years, am I not seen as family? \nI have tried to give him little hints over the last week or so hoping he will remember. Over the weekend, I even asked if we could do a date tomorrow night before his family comes in, hoping that once he saw the date it would click, but nothing. When I brought back up our date today, he looked at me confused and then proceeded to make up something on the spot about how we\u2019re going to the movies because he knows I love that. When we originally planned this though, we were doing dinner and then going to a pop up bar downtown so I was very confused. I don\u2019t care that the plan has changed, I just know it\u2019s changed because he forgot. \nI bought him a beautiful leather watch for our anniversary this year and still plan on giving it to him tomorrow. I know that once he sees it, he\u2019s going to freak out and ask me why I didn\u2019t remind him. But I feel like after three years, this is something that should be important to the both of us and I shouldn\u2019t have to remind you. I plan to give it to him before we go to dinner so he can wear it out, but does that make me an asshole? I\u2019m not giving it to him to be malicious and throw it in his face, I genuinely want to give him his gift that I spent a lot of time and effort on. So, am I the asshole for not reminding him and still giving him his gift?\n\nEDIT: to all the people saying I am testing him, that is not the case. We talked about it at the end of last month and he said HE would plan something. There has been NO mention this month as it got closer. I am an event planner for a living and plan things every single day for other people and he knows this, so he knows he\u2019s in charge of planning dates and anniversaries for us. He does this every single holiday though, he says he will plan it and then the day comes and I am ultimately the one having to take over and figure something out for us last minute. Why should I have to keep reminding someone about something they tasked themselves with? \n\nFinal edit: I forgot about this until people mentioned calendars. We do have a shared calendar where I have our anniversary in it, so we BOTH can see it. I\u2019ve had it shared with him since last year.

That was his choice.  At 3 years together it should be easy for him to remember your anniversary, and if it isn't then he needs to take steps to correct that, such as a phone reminder or buying a calendar.  You're his girlfriend, not his secretary - it's not your job to remind him!", ">We talked about it at the end of last month and he said HE would plan something.

I think you need to decide if you want this relationship or not. If you could look ahead and know with certainty that this guy will never be a planner and never get good at remembering anniversaries, would you still net net be glad you were in the relationship? Yes or No are both fine and valid answers. But it's time for radical acceptance or getting out. Hoping he'll change isn't getting you anywhere good.", "NTA for not reminding him, I guess, but is there any reason to act so secretive with dropping hints? Why not just come right out and say \"What should we do for our anniversary next month? In two months?\" yknow, plan ahead together? That's what husband and I do. \n\nMy brain immediately had me wondering if he was planning on proposing with his parents present and that's why he's been mum and focused on their arrival.", ">So, am I the asshole for not reminding him and still giving him his gift?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, but it only extends as far as the question.

I put all this dates on my phone for it remember me the days before. Its ok to forget, its not ok when this happens all the time and you dont do anything about it. \n\nMaybe, hopefully, he didnt forget and is gonna surprise you. Wait and see. If not, talk to him about how this kind of things hurt you.", "NTA.  It\u2019s on your shared calendar and you did discuss it the month prior.

Don't be too mean about him forgetting, but maybe sit back and think if you want to continue to be in this situation. 3 years is a lot of time to be the only one remembering and planning stuff alone with a person who makes empty promises (i forgot is an excuse once, if it's a pattern is a sign that they don't find it important enough to remember). If you think it's okay to be the only one who plans and remembers everything, cuz otherwise your relationship is happy and satisfying and a net positive in your life - that's great, you will know to lower your expectations and maybe seriously explain that you prefer if he doesn't promise stuff he can't do (some people don't have the skills). But if you would prefer a person, who is able to do some of the planning at least for special occasions and who wants to show you he values your time together through commemorating specific days of your life together - I think you already know this is not who he is.\n I don't judge either of those things - i don't care about special days much i prefer to be respected and cared for in the small ways day to day not do big hooplas on birthdays and anniversaries, but with people who do care about special days, including my friends i do my best to set a reminder in my calendar in advance to plan something that can show them i care about them.", "I'm not going to give a judgement, but I am going to give unsolicited advice.\n\n\nIf there is someone in your life who consistently betrays your expectations of them, there are a few things you can do: 1. Keep your expectations the same and get annoyed/hurt every single time. 2. Drop the person from your life. 3. Change your expectations and accommodate accordingly.\n\n\nIf someone is bad at remembering or planning stuff, the likelihood of them changing is very, very low. It's just not in their nature.\nThe best thing to do is to either accept that he's going to forget stuff like this and plan things yourself, or work out a system together that makes him remember.\n\n\nBut keeping your expectations/wishes that he remembers and plans stuff without further prompting is probably only going to make you very frustrated in the long term.", ">Why should I have to keep reminding someone about something they tasked themselves with?\n\nI feel like better questions would be, why do you want to be with someone who can't even remember your anniversary? Why be with someone who doesn't put in effort? Why be with someone who continuously breaks his promises?", "He\u2019s not a child. He can remember important dates. He just doesn\u2019t want to. OP went as far as she could go to help him and still give him a tiny little role in remembering the anniversary and doing something, anything, to honor it. NTA \n\nAnd as others have said, since he has said he doesn\u2019t want to marry OP, maybe she would benefit from really evaluating the relationship and considering her long term prospects.", "ESH stop playing games and bring it up. You\u2019re breeding resentment.\n\nReading a few comments indicates he doesn\u2019t seem to care, in which case, dump and move on.", "Nta- I was in a relationship with someone like this for 5 years\nIt will not get better. He will forget each year. He will ask you to prep the house. He will ask you to pitch in on tickets while forgetting your anniversary\n\nI know that feeling of a nagging pit in your stomach and then convincing your self surely he must know and being let down every time and then blaming yourself for not telling him and surely if you would've just hinted better...\n\nI know it feels dramatic to say this after 1 event, but I would take a look at the whole relationship. If you notice a pattern like this, and he's made no effort to work on it after several conversations, it's time to re evaluate\n\nMy grandmother told me once: be with someone who if they kept all their same flaws for the next 40 years, you'd be happy.

Some people are just not great with remembering dates. He's not *intentionally* forgetting your anny. So instead of reminding him days ago - giving him enough time to make things right and make you happy - you're instead going to blow up the evening and probably ruin the thanksgiving visit with his fam\n\nYTA.

You know the day is coming, you know he forgot, you know there\u2019s stuff going on, you know he\u2019ll feel bad when he realizes. What on earth do you have to gain from not just telling him?\n\nI\u2019m piss poor with dates and anniversaries and stuff and this makes me so thankful that my partner doesn\u2019t play games about it.", "YTA for not reminding him.  Instead of working to ensure this was a day you could enjoy together, you turned it into a relationship test - always a bad idea - and a cause for embarrassment for him. You say you weren't trying to be malicious, but you also weren't acting like you and he are on the same team.", "Honestly, NAH.\n\nIt's human to forget. You said that you guys are busy planning for family to come in. Anniversary planning, to me, is something you both plan together, and I think you should have brought it up. \n\nIt seems this is the first time he's forgotten something like this, and while I agree he should probably remember, I also feel like you could have saved yourself the stress and mentioned it.", "Maybe he is planning on asking you to marry him? That's why they parents are coming and he isn't \"taking your hints\" about the anniversary", "YTA.\n\nIt's 2023. If you want to do something for your anniversary, then plan it and make it happen. Why is all of this on him?", "ESH\n\nSure, he should get better at setting reminders, but he is only lightly an AH about this. He has sincerely just forgotten.  You are making a decision. I *hate* these relationship litmus tests. It's almost always a strong indicator that you are not yet emotionally mature enough to be in a successful long-term relationship. \n\nGood partners shore up each other's weaknesses and forgive each others faults. Instead of just reminding him of the upcoming event, you are waiting for emotional revenge because you feel slighted. What a nice gift /s. He'll never forget what you did for him this year.", "Info: Genuine question here OP. Does it matter that you do something on your anniversary? If your bf said to you \"hey I don't want to make our anniversary into something extravagant\" would you be okay with that?\n\nCan you not decide on another day being your anniversary?", "Oh honey\u2026\n\nYWBTA (you would be the ah) for setting him up to fail. Full stop. You say you know he\u2019ll feel bad if you give him the watch and he has nothing for you, and tbh you\u2019ll feel worse as well because you can\u2019t prepare yourself for future disappointment - that will rear its ugly head as it sees fit.\n\nWhat you can do is communicate directly and remind him, but also what if he does remember and has something planned and is trying to keep it from you, but your ruminating is causing you undue stress? Or what if he did forget amongst the excitement that his family is coming into town to see you two for the holiday? You can not compare yourself to that - that\u2019s unfair for both of you.\n\nIf he forgets an anniversary, so what? It\u2019s a date on a calendar, and you\u2019ll have another one next year. Have a level headed conversation with him after about being a little more mindful and inclusive of you, and hug it out if that\u2019s really the only issue to speak of.\n\nSpeaking of calendars, have you two tried syncing yours, or at least creating synced events? My husband and I use Apple Calendar for everything or we\u2019d forget everything, and we invite the other to the mutual events so we\u2019re both locked in with reminders. I think proposing something like that is a healthier way of going about this than setting up potential road blocks for your partner.\n\nAll that said, I totally get where you\u2019re coming from. Your feelings are valid, but please don\u2019t respond to them in an unhealthy manner. You don\u2019t want to unintentionally cause an issue between you two that simmers under the surface of his family\u2019s visit. That will cause undue resentment that you can avoid by just talking with your partner.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you have a wonderful anniversary with him and a really special holiday with his family, which you are absolutely part of if he\u2019s excited to have you all together for a really family oriented holiday. \ud83d\udda4", "Why are you being so passive aggressive? Yes YTA, he\u2019s excited about his family coming to visit and is probably a little distracted. So mention you\u2019d like to celebrate your anniversary (it\u2019s not a real anniversary, you\u2019re not married) before they get there. Don\u2019t just stew and post online and set him up for you to throw a tantrum later and ruin everyone\u2019s Thanksgiving.", "His family is coming to town, he is excited about that.

It is not that \"*but after 3 years, am I not seen as family\",* it means he is distracted by an unusual event. \n\nYou are setting him up and testing him.

Secondly, maybe a month is too far out for a person who struggles with remembering events and dates. \n\nIf he has any sort of ADHD or ASD, this may be apart of it. Or, he could just be a space cadet. Either way, use your words and shoot straight. \n\nMaybe you guys need to plan these events together moving forward.", "YTA. Stop playing mind games. Tell him about your anniversary so he, or both of you can plan something. You're setting yourself up for disappointment on purpose because you're upset with him for forgetting, it's petty. Stop trying to get him in trouble.", "YTA.  You're not actually married, right?  So \"anniversary\" is a a date commemorating....what, exactly?  A first date?  A first kiss?

Maybe he genuinely doesn't want to put effort in and good that you know now... or maybe he did remember and has a whole surprise plan he didn't want to tell you about. Honestly, the point is, you don't know. Present the problem, give him a chance to consider it, and talk to you, or more likely, do something to fix it, or confront the problem, end things, and move on. \n\nGoing the passive-aggressive route won't solve anything long term. You are partners. If you care about remaining that way, be a team player and step in. He forgot, so you take the initiative to a. Let him know, and b. Explain how you feel about it. Work together for a solution. Or... don't, and end it. Really, that simple.", "Just dropping by with my two cents.  If your relationship is otherwise good, mind you this is imho only, that \u201cdating\u201d anniversaries aren\u2019t something to stress about.

I used to get bent out of shape about\u2014in the grand scheme of things\u2014pretty self absorbed matters.  I used to get upset about missed dating anniversaries, Sweetest Day, etc etc etc.  It took a lot of introspection to realize he treated me well Every Day and I had no reason to cause unnecessary conflict.  Now I can\u2019t even remember the month or year we met, much less the day.  Not everyone is good with remembering dates.  It\u2019s just a fact and isn\u2019t a personal attack.  Wedding anniversary?  That\u2019s different.  Take it from someone who has ruined good days and caused unnecessary shame to my partner.

And I do have dates in my calendar,  but I don't always look at my calendar. I should, I know, but I don't remember to. If I have a special appointment of any kind I have to set about 5 reminders, at increasingly tight intervals to remember it. I am totally capable of going to bed excited that I am going to have breakfast with a friend the next day, then waking up with absolutely zero memory of it, unless I happen to look at my phone. If, say, I happen to notice  hummingbird in the garden, I might be out there having a high old time while my phones buzzes uselessly indoors.\nAND God help me if I forget to turn off the \"do not disturb \", or set the alarm clock and forget wiggle the little button in the back to turn it on.\nI have some ADHD like traits, and seldom remember what day it is. \nThat doesn't mean I don't love my friends, or my husband.

If one of us remembers the anniversary,  we come running to the other and say, \"hey, guess what day it is today? What shall we do?\"..there is plenty of love on the other days, too, even if we blow the exact date. Like right now I'm  traveling for work in a foreign country.
