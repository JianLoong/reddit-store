I get that people are accurately identifying that Katie is hinting at what she wants, but this places OP in a difficult conundrum. If he takes the hint and acts on it, she's going to think that pestering her bf about unrelated things all the time works, and honestly I couldn't live my life being perpetually griped at by proxy by someone. Katie should open her mouth and say what she wants. Hints and vague suggestions are manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, OP is showing he doesn't give a fuck about what Katie wants. At any time he could have said \"why are you speaking about this couple so highly, is that what you want from our relationship?\" and engage her in a proper conversation about what she needs and wants. It would show respect for her and if she still refuses to engage she can't then complain he doesn't get the hint.\n\nOP is ignorant. Katie is manipulating instead of speaking plainly.

She needs to say I WANT/I NEED and then proceed as opposed to \u201cJOE DOES THIS and JOE DOES THAT he dont give a shit about Joe and Mary and what they do.", "I struggle with social cues and reading between the lines and even i got it!", "A bunch of internet strangers will assume anything out of anything, lol.\n\nThat doesn't mean she airplane be clear and communicate this to OP directly rather than hope he picks up on her hints.", "That may be the case but what she is currently doing isnt going to help anything. Hell even if their relationship is good and she doesnt want what the other couple have nobody wants to hear about the same people over and over and over all the time that would be annoying as hell.", "I get the feeling that they're both young and she hasn't figured out that hints aren't effective communication.\n\nAnd he hasn't figured out how not to be a dismissive asshole.", "Sure but thats what you would do you would pick up what she is putting down not everyone is good with hints or even gets them at all some people need direct communication because he in fact did not pick up the hints even as he typed this out he didnt get it all he sees is her obsessing over other people and he doesnt get it because to him they are not #relationshipgoals he thinks they are boring so she needs to see hints aint his thing and tell him she wants that kind of relationship and if he is opposed to working on it in that way they can part ways and not waste each others time because to me she sounds exhausting and he sounds like a jerk.", "When I\u2019m exited about trying something w my bf i excitedly talk to him about it. But to be fair this dude sounds like an ass so if she wants to leave I don\u2019t blame her.", "Ohh I\u2019m sorry\u2026In my sleep deprived state, I miss read that. I still say she should just tell OP what she wants and not just hope he gets it from inference.", "Lol that\u2019s a whole lot of assumption/projection", "> I have a feeling she may have tried direct communication\n\nWhy?", ">Not a spouse. They're dating, not married.\n\nYeah whatever.\n\n>And while communicating \"I'd prefer if\" statements is ideal, it's possible (and likely) that she's already done this\n\nYou don't know if she has. \n\n>And an accepted (and sometimes counseled) way of communicating with people who won't even listen to direct requests is to show them an example of what whatever-it-is might look like. Sometimes therapists will suggest this... for a variety of different situations.\n\nOP's girlfriend isn't a therapist and they aren't in a therapy session. Just communicate how you feel. \n\n>I don't know if that's what's happening here, but you don't know that it isn't. There's absolutely nothing in this post to indicate either way\n\nTrue. \n\n>And I know, it's the internet, we see a lot of stuff about women trying to \"hint\" and \"trick\" men into buying them the thing or doing the thing, or whatever. But not everyone is like that, and we can't just knee-jerk ascribe the same motivations to behaviors which are normal\n\nDon't really know how true this is. \n\n>It's perfectly normal to want to spend time with people you admire. To discuss what you admire about them. And to wish for that sort of quality in your own life/relationship.\n\nI mean, yeah? But there is definitely a line where it crosses into obsession. \n\n>Let's not act like that's some devious plot to force OP into something unhealthy, please.\n\nI left one sentence and from one sentence you think I'm acting like there's a \"nefarious plot\"? All I said was that she should use her words like an adult.", ">And at the very least, she can see behaviors that she wishes OP would do. \n\nAnd this doesn't change anything because I already said:\n\n>Also, if Katie does want to do things differently in her own relationship, she doesn't need to start off with \"Well Mary and Joe do this, so we should do this\".\n\n\"We need to be more respectful of one another\"\n\nvs\n\n\"Mary and Joe are very respectful of each other, we should do that too\"\n\nThere is absolutely ZERO reason to every make the second statement.   Unless you want to 1. potentially  antagonize your S/O and 2.  Risk it blowing up in your face when the \"perfect\" couple ends up being committing infidelity or whatever. \n\nAnd a few months of casual hanging out here and there means absolutely nothing.  Katie only hears the good stuff because that's what Mary (read: most people) want.  \n\nShockingly enough, the \"bad stuff\" in your relationship isn't exactly common knowledge unless you're VERY good friends OR a breaking point is reached.  Off the top of my head, I can think of  multiple relationships that appeared \"perfect\" to their friend circles...until they imploded due to cheating, abuse, and just general scumbaggery.", "If they didn't then proper communication about how the relationship isn't going to work would have occurred and they could move on and both be happy elsewhere", "Well also, why couldn't OP come out and tell her that he didn't like the way she talked about this couple so much? Instead, OP came back with rudeness and insults. Maybe if op said \"its odd that you talk about them so much, why is that?\" They could've had an adult conversation. Instead, op goes with the ole classic \"if you love it so much, why don't you marry them\" technique.", "so maybe this isn\u2019t what is happening, but I\u2019ve started using that tactic when my actual words weren\u2019t working. So maybe, and i\u2019m getting that vibe here, buddy has very selective hearing.", "Subtle hints that our relationship is trash in her opinion wouldn't make me want to try harder, it would hurt and probably push me away a bit. Why couldn't they just say something?", "He absolutely does get it and that\u2019s why he\u2019s Pisse off . Otherwise why is eh even bothered", "True, they aren\u2019t really, but again, most people at a flat out point would just ask, or even somewhat get the hint that they\u2019re hinting. Especially if this has been going on for MONTHS", "True but it feels like he never even tried to really listen to her. This whole thing is written as if it was a constant dismissal of her feelings or her thoughts, that\u2019s been brewing for months. You\u2019re gonna tell me for months it wouldn\u2019t ever occur that maybe she was hinting at something? Even for a brief second? Especially since it seems she is just talking about their relationship? \n\nIf this was like, a week, maybe a month at max then yeah. I\u2019d totally get it. But he\u2019s made it clear that this has been happening for months. \n\nI\u2019m bad at signs but even I realize after some time that hey, maybe I\u2019m trying to be told something. \n\nHowever, I do not know his girlfriend, but if 97% of the comments get it.. then it\u2019s more obvious than you think. I don\u2019t really think he\u2019s truly listening to her or paying attention to what she\u2019s thinking.", "I think that's definitely fair--and it's certainly how I operate--but I think it's a mistake to consider anyone who *doesn't* operate that way automatically the asshole. There's a lot of reasons why someone might not do that. For anything else, it's possible OP is a generally insecure person and that kind of direct feedback might send them into a spiral.", "To me it came off as you belittling her for hinting she may want to talk about their relationship. Not everyone can directly say what they want. Dropping hints is probably the best she has.", "That is not true at all. It\u2019s a literal communication technique therapists recommend so to say there is no reason to phrase something like that is not only untrue but ignorant. Not everyone deals with blunt communication well and especially when it\u2019s criticism, many many people have had issues in relationships where their partner says \u201cnobody does that\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s just fairytale drama\u201d etc etc, and some people need something or someone to rationalize the logic behind an argument. Liking and wanting things from certain relationships others have does not mean they are perfect and even so sometime perfect couples don\u2019t work out for other reasons. If mentioning another persons relationship you admire is going to \u201cantagonize\u201d your partner then it\u2019s from their own insecurities and issues and has nothing to do with the partner. People model their relationships from people they admire, millions of people say my parents/grandparents/family did this and it makes me want to continue to do this, and no one finds issue with it, because again you model relationships from those you admire.", "Yes, sure, they might be awful behind closed doors. But that doesn't negate that Katie wants OP to act more like public-Joe, does that make sense? Public-Joe could be a complete facade. We don't know. But just to use a small made-up example, if public-Joe always asks Mary how her day was, and OP doesn't ask Katie that, Katie is still allowed to want that! Even if private-Joe doesn't do it.", "I mean I did say all he had to say was I dont want to hear about them anymore. He came back the way he did because he is fed up with what he sees as an obsession with a random couple she has only known a few months. They clearly dont communicate well and he may be the type that hates beating around the bush and doesnt respond to it thats exactly what shes doing shes going around the bush and up a damn tree instead of communicating and OP is getting pissed and also not communicating well.", "100% I would not take this well but Im big on communication and saying what I want and need to my husband. I would never go about it the way she is he could have expressed his distaste in a nicer way and just stopped at \u201cI dont want to hear about them\u201d but she sucks as well grow up and open your mouth.", "Still doesnt mean because we all can see it he should too. I know someone exactly like OP who was in a similar situation but with his child. She was talking about her friends dad and all the one on one time they spend for months. Now he never got mad at her he was always just like oh thats nice or cool or that sounds fun for them but never picked up she wanted the same kind of bonding with him. I heard her one day and asked him was he gonna take her on a father/daughter date now as well since she was so excited talking about her friends date with her dad. He said and I quote \u201cyou think I should? You think she would like that?\u201d I was like dude she just gave a neon sign that she would love it and then it finally set in that all her talking was hints. He then went on to do those things which is awesome. \n\nNot everyone is wired the same I really dont think OP sees it as hints in any way shape or form. He just sees his SO enamored with a new couple and he doesnt get it.", "What? I didn\u2019t say she was an asshole. I said she should communicate her wants. How is that controversial? \n\nOne relationship that always stated is to clearly state you wants because people aren\u2019t mind readers and mostly obvious. How is that saying that bad?", ">To me it came off as you belittling her for hinting she may want to talk about their relationship\n\nAnd if I am, so what? The key to a healthy relationship is to *communicate* with each other. Not drop hints. \n\n>Not everyone can directly say what they want. Dropping hints is probably the best she has.\n\nI mean this just sounds like BS to me lol.", "I hear you, but I also think there's a lot of hard speculation on the gfs motives. She may not be beating around the bush. She may be genuinely taken by how good their relationship is (and sounds like she is really looking up to Mary). I took your response as saying  that the gf should communicate better, so my reply is more along the lines of OP actually being the one who isn't communicating. There's no indication the gf has any issue, she's only overly praising thia couple (which I agree would be annoying). But, if OP had an issue then they should've said something before they snapped and insulted her seemingly out of nowhere."]}
