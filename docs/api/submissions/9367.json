She wrote a long ass message saying that she had tried everything with me and she thought if she was patient and clear about her needs, I would eventually change for her. But she realized thanks to Mary and Joe that it's not her job to raise a man and get her boyfriend to respect her. She wrote a lot of other things about Mary too, like that Mary is truly proud of her husband and looks up to him, meanwhile she (Katie) can't find it in herself to look up to me in anything and so on...

I get that people are accurately identifying that Katie is hinting at what she wants, but this places OP in a difficult conundrum. If he takes the hint and acts on it, she's going to think that pestering her bf about unrelated things all the time works, and honestly I couldn't live my life being perpetually griped at by proxy by someone. Katie should open her mouth and say what she wants. Hints and vague suggestions are manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, OP is showing he doesn't give a fuck about what Katie wants. At any time he could have said \"why are you speaking about this couple so highly, is that what you want from our relationship?\" and engage her in a proper conversation about what she needs and wants. It would show respect for her and if she still refuses to engage she can't then complain he doesn't get the hint.\n\nOP is ignorant. Katie is manipulating instead of speaking plainly.

You also missed the obvious subtext she was trying to communicate to you: \"These people have the kind of relationship I would like to have with you, and we should be taking notes.\"\n\nWhich, of course, makes me wonder whether your girlfriend is just thinking long-term or if there are factors in your current relationship that aren't going the way way she needs them to go.

If mentioning another persons relationship you admire is going to \u201cantagonize\u201d your partner then it\u2019s from their own insecurities and issues and has nothing to do with the partner.

Point out you answered the question you thought she asked (you probably did). What else did she mean?\n\nA classic example of this is the woman who needs to pee while she is in a car driving with her boyfriend/husband. She asks HIM \"Do you need to stop at the rest stop? There's one coming up.\" What she means is \"I have to use the rest stop.\"\n\nHe answers, \"No, I'm fine.\"\n\nAnd then she gets annoyed. How hard is it to say, \"I have to use the restroom.

It's not your partners job to read between the lines, you should be explicitly stating anything important.\n\nThat said the OP is an AH for getting angry, but it is clear he is jealous of his GFs infatuation with this new couple.", "A couple having a grown up conversation and saying what they want? There's a novel idea.", "OP is definitely TA but I couldn't handle being in a relationship with someone who dances around things in that way.  I struggle with subtext and do not have the mental energy to try to understand if there's a secret message to the story.  \n\nIt's much easier to say \"I really like the way this other couple handles housework, and I would like to try it.\"", "Maybe that's why Katie doesn't say things outright because she's wary that he may respond in this manner so she tries to hint at things instead and he still lashes out \ud83d\ude15", "I agree. I didn't even get that she was *comparing* as much as she was talking about the qualities she admired in the other relationship. After rereading the post, I'm not sure where the \"comparing one relationship to another is passive aggressive\" comments are coming from? \n\nOP's more like, \"GF is praising another relationship to me and I'm feeling inadequate because I recognize I don't do those things and we don't have that, but now I resent feeling inadequate because also I don't *want* to do those things and therefore GF shouldn't want them either.\" \n\nDude, maybe she's just trying to start a conversation after she's seen what's possible in a relationship", "And he can ignore it and keep up the same old bullshit if she stops talking about it. He\u2019s aware of what\u2019s up.", "Yeah this is my take too. She is clearly using the comparison as a way to passive aggressively complain about the flaws in their own relationship. I kinda want to go with a soft ESH because neither of them are communicating well.", "Saying \u201cI love x relationship because they do y\u201d is pretty explicit imo. \n\nOP could have taken that as is, \u201cmy girlfriend likes y in a relationship\u201d and could have chosen to do more y things or if confused, ask \u201chow can our relationship be more like x?\u201d\n\nInstead OP went full nuclear. He describes his girlfriend\u2019s conversation as \u201cblah blah blah\u201d and essentially tells her to stfu about it. \n\nSure, girlfriend could have said \u201cI want you to do y,\u201d but OP doesn\u2019t sound like they respect their girlfriend\u2019s interests, relationships, or views enough for that to have worked anyway tbh", "But this is my point. Who said that the gf was trying to communicate anything except how much she loved this couple's relationship? That was a motive given to her, not a motive we have any proof of her having. So if she's only being annoying bc she keeps talking about how great their relationship is, then OP snapping at her is all op not communicating that this was an issue.", "I fully agree in that but I was just offering a possibility. It is possible she never said anything too.\n\nI've just seen people have to lead partners to come up with an idea due to subtle hints too many times because they are very angry if it is implied they aren't doing enough/right.", "I used to do this when I was early 20s maybe Katie is fairly young or at least emotionally immature and doesn't know how to do this stuff yet. There's no ages mentioned and idk it took me years to actually grow enough of a backbone to say what I want and need to my partner either crying or being scared of their reaction- totally unwarranted worry I know but for me was a symptom of some childhood trauma, I was always on eggshells around y dad and used to have almost panic attacks when I needed something from him because of his reactions to a request.", "Dr Bitchcraft has spoken.", "This was my initial opinion too but I'm going with OP is TA for his utter lack of introspection.", "I was wondering if anyone would say this. Look - I grew up in a seriously unhealthy household.  I'm still, at the age of fifty, blown \\*away\\* when I see healthy parent-child dynamics. I've grown to understand that what I grew up with isn't normal, healthy or right - but to actually see it done well? It's just really amazing to me, and I love it. Hell, I probably go on about my roommate to damned near anyone who will listen because he's one of the best damned human beings I know - kind, considerate and thoughtful without being a doormat. It is very possible that GF gew up like me - seeing unhealthy relationships - and she's just really excited by seeing something healthy, and getting to experience what that is like, second-hand.. And yes, that's likely going to influence how she looks at her relationship - so maybe her boyfriend \\*should\\* be paying some attention to what she's saying, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's trying to be underhanded or passive aggressive.", "Where are you getting that it wasn't?", " Sorry you felt like that I hope you are doing better now", "This. I can nearly guarantee they're in their early to mid twenties.", "Username checks out!", "Yeah, I mean you have to be a few eggs short of a dozen if you think you can tell your significant other to go join a different couple as a third or imply they are a child who should be adopted by a different couple and then still expect them to hang out with you/sleep with you after talking to them that way.\n\nHe obviously is under the impression he can be super ass rude and debasing and then still get what he wants from her.\n\nHopefully this was a wake up call for his GF. Not only is he not picking up what she's laying down but he's willing to respond with verbal abuse over it."]}
