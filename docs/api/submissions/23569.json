{"id": 23569, "submission_id": "15ek5hy", "title": "AITA for finally telling my mother in law that her mac and cheese tastes terrible?", "selftext": "My husband 30m and I 28f have been married for 2 years, together for 5 years, and currently 6 months pregnant. We are very excited and blessed because I've had some complications in getting pregnant. I have a very good relationship with my in laws and if any of us ever had problem, we are able to talk it through. Except for one thing. My mother in law has her famous mac and cheese that everyone in her family absolutely loves. \n\nI, however, found it disgusting on day 1 but I didn't want to come off as rude and ungrateful so I pulled through it without saying anything. I told my husband about it and he said that his mother has been making it for decades perfecting the recipe and she would be deeply offended if anyone told her anything bad about her mac and cheese so I should just find the right moment to tell her. He for some reason loves it, so he didn't want to be the one to tell her. Which I totally understand because it is MY issue and I had to deal with it. It's been almost 2 years of me pretending. \n\nSo 2 days ago I've decided to just tell her. It was a family dinner where my husband's parents had invited us over and of course, his mother was making her so-called \"famous mac and cheese\". I almost threw up at the smell and I couldn't bear the thought of eating it, probably because I was pregnant. \n\nSo at dinner, when I was offered the mac and cheese, I politely declined and said \"no thank you\". My mother in law looked at me and asked \"why? You should eat. Good for the baby\". And I just went right out with it \"I'm sorry, but I don't like your mac and cheese. Everything else tastes delicious, but this is the one thing I simply cannot eat anymore\". She looked so deeply offended and she literally snapped \"well, thanks for being honest\" and didn't even look or speak to me for the rest of the evening. My husband was on my side and tried to speak to his mother, but all I know is that it didn't work because she has been cold to me ever since. \n\nWhat was wrong with the mac and cheese? Her \"perfecting the recipe\" ended up with this result: mac and cheese combined with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic. I don't have a problem with the greens or onion, but the rest tastes so disgustingly wrong with mac and cheese. \nHowever, the reason why I think I might have been an asshole is because like my husband said, she has been perfecting this recipe for years, her entire family clearly loves it, and I tell her that her \"perfected and loved\" mac and cheese is terrible. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nEdit. I did tell her that because I was pregnant it wasn't possible for me to stomach the ingredients, but she still didn't want to talk to me.", "created_utc": 1690819308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ek5hy/aita_for_finally_telling_my_mother_in_law_that/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Normally I\u2019d say you should just suck it up and pick at it on your plate, then say everything else was so good you filled up too soon.

On the other hand, she shouldn\u2019t be pressuring you on what you should eat as a grown woman, pregnant or not, but on top of that should be more understanding to the appetite changes and nausea that comes with pregnancy.

You list random ingredients like Salmon and Kimchi to sway us to your side... but I can rightfully see through that here. She's putting a twist on Mac n Cheese, you're allowed not to like it. Your incredibly snooty attitude was picked up in your post in spades. Who cares if you can make 3 Star Michelin Mac? Or basic Mac? If you don't want to eat something, don't eat it.

The only thing in there that sounds a little whack is the pineapple, but the sweetness might really add something.

We are very excited and blessed because I've had some complications in getting pregnant. I have a very good relationship with my in laws and if any of us ever had problem, we are able to talk it through. Except for one thing. My mother in law has her famous mac and cheese that everyone in her family absolutely loves. \n\nI, however, found it disgusting on day 1 but I didn't want to come off as rude and ungrateful so I pulled through it without saying anything. I told my husband about it and he said that his mother has been making it for decades perfecting the recipe and she would be deeply offended if anyone told her anything bad about her mac and cheese so I should just find the right moment to tell her. He for some reason loves it, so he didn't want to be the one to tell her. Which I totally understand because it is MY issue and I had to deal with it. It's been almost 2 years of me pretending. \n\nSo 2 days ago I've decided to just tell her. It was a family dinner where my husband's parents had invited us over and of course, his mother was making her so-called \"famous mac and cheese\". I almost threw up at the smell and I couldn't bear the thought of eating it, probably because I was pregnant. \n\nSo at dinner, when I was offered the mac and cheese, I politely declined and said \"no thank you\". My mother in law looked at me and asked \"why? You should eat. Good for the baby\". And I just went right out with it \"I'm sorry, but I don't like your mac and cheese. Everything else tastes delicious, but this is the one thing I simply cannot eat anymore\". She looked so deeply offended and she literally snapped \"well, thanks for being honest\" and didn't even look or speak to me for the rest of the evening. My husband was on my side and tried to speak to his mother, but all I know is that it didn't work because she has been cold to me ever since. \n\nWhat was wrong with the mac and cheese? Her \"perfecting the recipe\" ended up with this result: mac and cheese combined with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic. I don't have a problem with the greens or onion, but the rest tastes so disgustingly wrong with mac and cheese. \nHowever, the reason why I think I might have been an asshole is because like my husband said, she has been perfecting this recipe for years, her entire family clearly loves it, and I tell her that her \"perfected and loved\" mac and cheese is terrible. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA Wait. So you decided to tell her at a family dinner? Why even say anything at all. Just politely refuse and say your stomach is upset.  Wtf. Who cares if YOU don\u2019t like it.

Why tell her when you know it would just hurt her feelings? Just say \u201coh I get sick when I eat Mac and cheese because of the pregnancy\u201d. I don\u2019t get why put your family through that.", "NTA pre, during and future post pregnancy.  That macaroni and cheese that you described that was \"perfected\" is culinary assault. That sounds wretched. I think she's really just doing it because she knows it's lousy and she just wanted to see what she could get away with and for how long because it's a power thing. I'm gratified to see that your husband stuck up for you in the moment and try to talk his mother down.", "The salmon, kimchi and pineapple sound absolutely disgusting to be combined with mac n cheese. That is very odd mixture of flavors and since its so out there of a combination that even I would not want, im going with nta. Maybe you can say it that way and see if she can portion you a plate without those additions. Nta due to very odd mixture of ingredients.", "YTA - That was awful timing and delivery.

Mac and cheese is so good because it's simple and should taste the same all the time no matter where you eat it.

MiL asked and wouldn't let it go, OP was just honest. \n\nPlus did you read the ingredients for this so called mac and cheese? That sounds disgusting.", "Because I was offered it, which means she expects me to eat it? And I couldn't do it anymore.", "I think Mac and Cheese with any one of these things might be totally fine... but that doesn't mean they should ALL go in at once.  \n\n\nNTA. That would make me nauseated and I'm not pregnant.", "Pineapples and salmon! \ud83e\udd2e", "You could say that. But if I told a family member they'd just leave that ingredient out next time and expect me to eat it. Better to say something like \"I don't like mac and cheese\"", "My husband is also from the land of hot dishes, and is always recommending that I add things to my Mac and cheese. Hard no, unless it\u2019s bacon. Feel free to add anything you want, after I serve it up to you. I\u2019m also a purist!", "I make mine with pepper, nutmeg, and paprika. Maybe bacon if I am being fancy pants.\n\nSEAWEED??? Like...what possessed her to think this was normal?", "What was the right way?", "To be fair, pineapple does work with mac and cheese. I went to an artisanal Mac and cheese place that mixed their pasta and cheese sauce with crumbled bacon and then topped it with pineapple and it was incredible.", "I want to try it.  I feel a disturbing fascination and I really want to try it. I don't expect to like it, but I really want to try it.", "I did tell her afterwards that because I'm pregnant it was impossible for me to stomach the ingredients, but she was still cold towards me. I was able to stomach it before, but because I'm pregnant the smell alone made me feel sick", ">the least perfect moment is in front the whole family\n\nThat's what makes OP the AH in my view. Nobody responds well to unexpected public humiliation. YTA.\n\nBut OMG that mac and cheese - I think I'd be sick.", "It was just her husband and his parents. Not in front of whole family. Mil asked a question, she got the answer. Not op fault she didn\u2019t like it.", "Mac&Geez-whatthehellisthat?!", "You didn't pickup on the fact that the OP is an unreliable narrator saying that she put \"Salmon, Collard Greens, Seaweed Salad, and Kimchi\" in her Mac and Cheese? \n\nObviously she's not doing this all in one Mac. OP is allowed not to like the Mac, but she doesn't have to actively lie to us and say \"She's putting pineapple, salmon, and collard greens all in one Mac n Cheese!\" just to sway us over to her side. MIL is being creative with Mac and Cheese, OP does not need to be TA to her simply because she has other tastes.", "I\u2019m sorry no, no one should be this experimental and expect everyone to automatically be on board. Glad that that woman found many foodie guinea pigs but OP doesn\u2019t have to be one of them. And no one should actually be faking allergies.", "I'm already an outlier in hating Mac n cheese,  but I'll eat a tiiiiny side dish of it to be polite at a dinner, this right here,  no. I might throw up on site even imagining the taste", ">Secondly, you politely turned her down. She is the one that badgered you for an answer. There's a rule \"Don't ask questions that you don't want an answer to \". She wouldn't let it go and demanded an answer right then and there, you were simply honest. All these Y T A responses seem to be missing this point. \n\nThis. The absolute simplest thing would have been for her to assume \"Oh, OP is pregnant, and pregnant people often have weird reactions to food!\" and let it go - but no, she has got so caught up in her world of everyone loving her unique take on Mac Cheese that she cannot just accept a \"No thanks, not this time\" from anyone. She just has to demand a good enough answer. \n\nAnd sorry, but that's on her. OP wasn't rude; she just answered the question.", "That's just asking for a nice big bowl of it once the pregnancy is over \ud83d\ude2d", "And pineapple.  \ud83e\udd22", "IDK, I would try it... Lol.", "I physically flinched when I read it.", "I was faking it for years because I couldn't find the right time to tell her. I also didn't want to offend her because we have a really good relationship.", "I'm going to make this tonight and ill report my findings.", ">NTA. Also, that\u2019s not Mac and cheese; that\u2019s pasta abomination.\n\nHello 999, I need to report a crime.  Mac & Cheese made with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic.  No it isn't a joke.  Yes, I do think armed police are appropriate to the situation.  Thank you very much.", "Op tried to decline and the mil was the one who asked what was wrong.", "She did politely refuse and MIL pushed. So she told her the truth that she didn't like it. She isn't the asshole for being truthful", "It was op husband and his parents. It wasn\u2019t in front of a bunch of people", "are you the MIL? ain\u2019t no way i\u2019d be offended or giving someone the childish silent treatment cause i was butthurt over a differing opinion. but uh, go off", "And keep lying forever? This had to happen eventually, why not now?", "That recipe made what my aunts have told me about my grandmother\u2019s salmon pudding sound damn delightful by comparison.", "Yeah that sounds absolutely vile.", "Yup. My partner\u2019s mother moved in with us for a while, we just implied I\u2019m allergic to margarine so I\u2019ll just put butter on my food.", "That ain't Mac n Cheese, it's a crime against Mac n Cheese.", "So what happens after she\u2019s done being pregnant and doesn\u2019t want to eat it? Lying would make OP TA not being honest. People should be open to constructive criticism or just having a different preference for foods. If you read the post you\u2019d see they did mention to their MIL that the pregnancy did play a role but she still wasn\u2019t having it. Parents are just sensitive and quick to make themselves the victims. Just a generational thing for boomers unfortunately", "So op should have continued to eat something she doesn\u2019t like after she done being pregnant?", "[why tho?](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZS5szjXtv5PozgTn8)", "I would eat it but im also asian so that combo seems fine to me", "To be fair I do eat salmon and make a cheese and pasta bake with it so for me that ingredient was fine but what is pineapple doing with salmon? What\u2019s kimchi doing near cheese?", "This is such a cute suggestion omg", "See lobster mac and cheese...yum. And my mom would make this one with tuna sometimes that wasn't terrible. But this is poison", "Yeah she said her MIL is Korean which explains it. It\u2019s just a different idea about flavor combos.", "This may actually top the infamous sweet chili in AITA Disgusting Crimes Against Food Hall of Fame. \n\nOP, NTA at all. That's isn't food; it's a war crime.", "salmon in mac n cheese is actually pretty good. tuna is also good imo", "I didn't even think that, to be honest. I just assumed it was going to be one of those normal family dishes that family members love but which isn't special to outsiders. Mac and cheese can especially be divisive for very minor reasons. But I was not prepared for the concoction she described. I have a very, very hard time believing that anyone sincerely likes that horrendous sounding dish.", "If someone has been lying about liking my food for two years, I would also be confused and ask questions.", "\u201cConcerned that someone so immature is having a baby\u201d Jesus Christ talk about an overreaction.", "The second suggestion would cover that.", "Oh yeah, it\u2019s the everything and the kitchen sink amalgam of all of them plus Mac and cheese I couldn\u2019t do. And like I said, things that I actually really like under normal circumstances I can\u2019t do sometimes pregnant. It\u2019s been better in the second trimester but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll come back in force during the third.", "Honestly with pregnancy you probably could keep it going.  There were some foods my sister was just permanently turned off of after she had her baby.", "Wow, I mean that just doesn\u2019t sound good at all, though not sure how it tastes. But gotta say NTA, if you find it nasty, and she insists on you having that, she\u2019s got to know how you really feel about it", "That actually explains both the additions and her behavior", "A little white lie never hurt. But she doesn\u2019t have to eat it after pregnancy either though. You can politely reject something and say, \u201cI just don\u2019t want any\u201d and leave it at that. She doesn\u2019t owe an explanation for why at all actually.", "Agreed!", "I read the ingredients but I did update my rating from Y T A  to NAH after her edit.", "I probably would have blamed baby, I\u2019m sorry MIL I don\u2019t think I can eat this I don\u2019t think the combination agrees with little one. Then post pregnancy your taste buds have changed,", "I think any of those ingredients could work with mac and cheese, but combine sounds atrocious. Collated green and seaweed salad would be a stretch, but I imagine salmon, pineapple, or kimchi would be alright.", "Oh - you mean after you humiliated her at *her* table in front of her family?  How nice of you.", "Yeah, it's the pineapple that pushes me over the edge, esp. when combined with those other ingredients. I just...no.", "Do you really have that good of a relationship if it's hinging on your faking something the entire time?\n\nSorry OP, but YTA for faking it for so long. If you had been honest that it's not something you personally enjoy early on, it probably would have been a lot easier for MIL to accept.", "Yeah cause she\u2019s been lying about liking it for years.", "Nice generalization. Manners exist for a reason. She knows that her mother-in-law is very invested in her mac and cheese. It would be very easy, as I said, to take a small amount and leave it. Of course it's dishonest. But a little dishonesty rather than hurting somebody is acceptable.", "Tbf I could almost see a Korean fusion Mac and cheese with gochujang and maybe a little kimchi being quite good? Much like the fusion creamy pastas that are popular now. What I don\u2019t understand is the specific combination of ingredients together. I mean, the pineapple sounds like a retro trendy cooking nightmare. Mac and cheese just doesn\u2019t need that much stuff in it", "Torture!!!! \ud83d\ude29 whyyyyyyyyyyyy", "I would never question why someone suddenly doesn\u2019t like a food anymore. Maybe because i go through phases and cant stand to stomach some food anymore after being obsessed with it for a month or two", "She said no thank you and mil still tried to push it on her saying its good for the baby. So i doubt that would even work. Plus if op kept saying no thank you mil would probably assume she didn\u2019t like it anyways", "You can put spaces between the letters, otherwise the bot counts all Y T A votes.", "Oh so another lie instead of the actual truth", "Okay admitted I am a bit of a picky eater, but a definite cheese lover. I guess that there some things that will go well in mac and cheese. However, this just too many things. :)", "I think you are being a little harsh.  She was being polite. There is nothing wrong with that. People do it all the time in good relationships.  Husbands and wives, in-laws, siblings, whatever. Questioning her whole relationship based on that is a bit much.", "There's nothing wrong with not liking a dish when she does like everything else in general. It's not special for OP, it's only special for the MIL, and getting this hurt over something this small is ridiculous. Like would you seriously want people to eat something that means a lot to you with absolute disgust? I honestly would want them to enjoy it or not eat it at all, it's a whole lot better", "Yeah I feel she does a mean jello salad\u2026 \nYou know what, maybe, with the kimchi. It\u2019s nice to have something to balance out the cheesy creaminess.", "Exactly.", "Oh thanks, I didn\u2019t know that!", "So if your grandma knitted you the worlds ugliest sweater in your least favorite color combination and it didn\u2019t fit you correctly you\u2019d say \u201chey, yo g-maw. This sweater sucks ass and I hate it.\u201d Instead of \u201cthank you grandma! I\u2019ll happily wear this when the weather permits!\u201d", "What\u2019s wrong with a white lie?", "It is the truth, it doesn\u2019t agree with either her or the baby, tastes can change after birth. It never said she ever enjoyed eating it. There is no value in saying to someone she likes and doesn\u2019t want to hurt your concoction is an affronting to good taste I only ate it before because I didn\u2019t want to hurt you. Years ago she could have said the combination isn\u2019t for me, but that ship sailed years ago.", "I know the at the moms pallete can change I\u2019m just saying if she doesn\u2019t want to keep saying no and lying the rest of her life"]}
