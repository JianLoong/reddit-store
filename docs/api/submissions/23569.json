{"id": 23569, "submission_id": "15ek5hy", "title": "AITA for finally telling my mother in law that her mac and cheese tastes terrible?", "selftext": "My husband 30m and I 28f have been married for 2 years, together for 5 years, and currently 6 months pregnant. We are very excited and blessed because I've had some complications in getting pregnant. I have a very good relationship with my in laws and if any of us ever had problem, we are able to talk it through. Except for one thing. My mother in law has her famous mac and cheese that everyone in her family absolutely loves. \n\nI, however, found it disgusting on day 1 but I didn't want to come off as rude and ungrateful so I pulled through it without saying anything. I told my husband about it and he said that his mother has been making it for decades perfecting the recipe and she would be deeply offended if anyone told her anything bad about her mac and cheese so I should just find the right moment to tell her. He for some reason loves it, so he didn't want to be the one to tell her. Which I totally understand because it is MY issue and I had to deal with it. It's been almost 2 years of me pretending. \n\nSo 2 days ago I've decided to just tell her. It was a family dinner where my husband's parents had invited us over and of course, his mother was making her so-called \"famous mac and cheese\". I almost threw up at the smell and I couldn't bear the thought of eating it, probably because I was pregnant. \n\nSo at dinner, when I was offered the mac and cheese, I politely declined and said \"no thank you\". My mother in law looked at me and asked \"why? You should eat. Good for the baby\". And I just went right out with it \"I'm sorry, but I don't like your mac and cheese. Everything else tastes delicious, but this is the one thing I simply cannot eat anymore\". She looked so deeply offended and she literally snapped \"well, thanks for being honest\" and didn't even look or speak to me for the rest of the evening. My husband was on my side and tried to speak to his mother, but all I know is that it didn't work because she has been cold to me ever since. \n\nWhat was wrong with the mac and cheese? Her \"perfecting the recipe\" ended up with this result: mac and cheese combined with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic. I don't have a problem with the greens or onion, but the rest tastes so disgustingly wrong with mac and cheese. \nHowever, the reason why I think I might have been an asshole is because like my husband said, she has been perfecting this recipe for years, her entire family clearly loves it, and I tell her that her \"perfected and loved\" mac and cheese is terrible. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nEdit. I did tell her that because I was pregnant it wasn't possible for me to stomach the ingredients, but she still didn't want to talk to me.\nAnother edit. I'm French and my husband's family is Korean, so that will explain the ingredients. I do enjoy salmon, kimchi, and seaweed salads, but it greatly depends on which dishes it's served with. \nAnd since I've been pregnant, I've even developed an aversion to several foods that I used to love.", "created_utc": 1690819308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ek5hy/aita_for_finally_telling_my_mother_in_law_that/", "score": 1502, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Normally I\u2019d say you should just suck it up and pick at it on your plate, then say everything else was so good you filled up too soon.

On the other hand, she shouldn\u2019t be pressuring you on what you should eat as a grown woman, pregnant or not, but on top of that should be more understanding to the appetite changes and nausea that comes with pregnancy.

You list random ingredients like Salmon and Kimchi to sway us to your side... but I can rightfully see through that here. She's putting a twist on Mac n Cheese, you're allowed not to like it.

I'm sorry what???\n\nI am somewhat torn, because I will eat pineapple on pizza, and I have had sweet noodle kugel with pineapple in it that I quite enjoy (and I suppose it is mac and cheese of a sort) but I uhh this seems wrong.", "NTA.\n\nOMG, I almost threw up when you mentioned the ingredients!!

I\u2019m shocked by all the not the AH votes, it seems that many people are voting that way because of the ingredient list instead of your actual behavior.", "NTA, \"Her \"perfecting the recipe\" ended up with this result: mac and cheese combined with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic.\" WTF is wrong with that woman. As a LOVER of Mac and Cheese, what she is serving isn't Mac and Cheese. It is some kind pot luck Frankenstein concoction. \n\nNow if you had said she added different kinds of cheese or different macaroni noodles then yes maybe, but that concoction is not mac and cheese. Be diplomatic about it and Just go back and tell her that since you are pregnant some of the ingredients just don't sit well on your stomach.

Geez.", "YTA.  You could\u2019ve softened it.  You should\u2019ve just said with the pregnancy, you can\u2019t tolerate certain tastes, smells, etc. or that you\u2019re allergic to some ingredient in it. Kimchi would\u2019ve been my choice.  Sounds absolutely disgusting to me but to each their own.", "NTA.  That recipe sounds like someone\u2019s garbage can after takeout from 6 different restaurants.", "YTA. I mean, you probably shouldve just said what you said in your edit instead of telling her that you hated it.

You're perfectly in your right not to like it, but you gotta maintain a relationship with the woman\n\nI personally think her recipe sounds very much worth a try lol. The only thing in there that sounds a little whack is the pineapple, but the sweetness might really add something. Adding a slice of american cheese (like Kraft slices) to ramen is something that's pretty popular in Asia these days, and it sounds gross, but it weirdly works. It's OK you don't like it, but no need to shit on everyone else\n\nETA: I'd totally try the recipe to see what it tastes like. There's a lot of delicious Asian food that I'd prefer not to know what the ingredients are, but doesn't mean it doesn't taste damn good.", "NTA. First off that so called recipe sounds disgusting. \n\nSecondly, you politely turned her down. She is the one that badgered you for an answer. There's a rule \"Don't ask questions that you don't want an answer to \". She wouldn't let it go and demanded an answer right then and there, you were simply honest. All these Y T A responses seem to be missing this point. \n\nSounds like either your husband's family has broken taste buds, or they eat it and pretend to love it because they know MiL would freak out otherwise. Either way you're not obligated to suffer through that for her ego.", "I'm super proud of many of the meals I make, and many people tell me they love my cooking, but some people don't like certain meals I make.

I do get really annoyed when someone lets me cook something for them multiple times before informing me that they don't like it, because now they have wasted my time and efforts. I could have been cooking something that everyone enjoyed, but this person couldn't be a grown up and say \"I don't like that\".

We are very excited and blessed because I've had some complications in getting pregnant. I have a very good relationship with my in laws and if any of us ever had problem, we are able to talk it through. Except for one thing. My mother in law has her famous mac and cheese that everyone in her family absolutely loves. \n\nI, however, found it disgusting on day 1 but I didn't want to come off as rude and ungrateful so I pulled through it without saying anything. I told my husband about it and he said that his mother has been making it for decades perfecting the recipe and she would be deeply offended if anyone told her anything bad about her mac and cheese so I should just find the right moment to tell her. He for some reason loves it, so he didn't want to be the one to tell her. Which I totally understand because it is MY issue and I had to deal with it. It's been almost 2 years of me pretending. \n\nSo 2 days ago I've decided to just tell her. It was a family dinner where my husband's parents had invited us over and of course, his mother was making her so-called \"famous mac and cheese\". I almost threw up at the smell and I couldn't bear the thought of eating it, probably because I was pregnant. \n\nSo at dinner, when I was offered the mac and cheese, I politely declined and said \"no thank you\". My mother in law looked at me and asked \"why? You should eat. Good for the baby\". And I just went right out with it \"I'm sorry, but I don't like your mac and cheese. Everything else tastes delicious, but this is the one thing I simply cannot eat anymore\". She looked so deeply offended and she literally snapped \"well, thanks for being honest\" and didn't even look or speak to me for the rest of the evening. My husband was on my side and tried to speak to his mother, but all I know is that it didn't work because she has been cold to me ever since. \n\nWhat was wrong with the mac and cheese? Her \"perfecting the recipe\" ended up with this result: mac and cheese combined with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic. I don't have a problem with the greens or onion, but the rest tastes so disgustingly wrong with mac and cheese. \nHowever, the reason why I think I might have been an asshole is because like my husband said, she has been perfecting this recipe for years, her entire family clearly loves it, and I tell her that her \"perfected and loved\" mac and cheese is terrible. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA Wait. So you decided to tell her at a family dinner? Why even say anything at all. Just politely refuse and say your stomach is upset.  Wtf. Who cares if YOU don\u2019t like it. From the ingredients I wouldn\u2019t like it either, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings if I didn\u2019t like it.", "YTA. Why tell her when you know it would just hurt her feelings? Just say \u201coh I get sick when I eat Mac and cheese because of the pregnancy\u201d. I don\u2019t get why put your family through that.", "NTA pre, during and future post pregnancy.  That macaroni and cheese that you described that was \"perfected\" is culinary assault. That sounds wretched. I think she's really just doing it because she knows it's lousy and she just wanted to see what she could get away with and for how long because it's a power thing. I'm gratified to see that your husband stuck up for you in the moment and try to talk his mother down.", "The salmon, kimchi and pineapple sound absolutely disgusting to be combined with mac n cheese. That is very odd mixture of flavors and since its so out there of a combination that even I would not want, im going with nta. Maybe you can say it that way and see if she can portion you a plate without those additions. Nta due to very odd mixture of ingredients.", "YTA - That was awful timing and delivery.

Mac and cheese is so good because it's simple and should taste the same all the time no matter where you eat it.

It sounds gross.", "Your big mistake was not stopping this early on. Like telling her that you're allergic or have a medical reason or just can't stand one (or more) of the ingredients. Or even just that you don't care for mac & cheese.\n\nAt this point, 5 years later, you should've blamed it on the pregnancy hormones.\n\nI can understand that she's hurt, but once you declined, she should have backed off and not pushed the issue.\n\nTry to mend things with her, if for no other reasons than so that she can and your baby can have a good relationship without tensions between you two, and to avoid awkwardness for your husband", "NTA. You weren't rude about it, we can't all like the same things, her behaviour is childish. That aside, that Mac and cheese sounds like the stuff of nightmares, absolutely dreadful", "NTA.

Later on, either that night or another time, you could have found a way to tell her you have a hard time with that combination of flavors and it doesn't sit well with you.

And even if I did, I\u2019m not sure if the lack of tact alone makes her an AH.
