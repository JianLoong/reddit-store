{"id": 23569, "submission_id": "15ek5hy", "title": "AITA for finally telling my mother in law that her mac and cheese tastes terrible?", "selftext": "My husband 30m and I 28f have been married for 2 years, together for 5 years, and currently 6 months pregnant. We are very excited and blessed because I've had some complications in getting pregnant. I have a very good relationship with my in laws and if any of us ever had problem, we are able to talk it through. Except for one thing. My mother in law has her famous mac and cheese that everyone in her family absolutely loves. \n\nI, however, found it disgusting on day 1 but I didn't want to come off as rude and ungrateful so I pulled through it without saying anything. I told my husband about it and he said that his mother has been making it for decades perfecting the recipe and she would be deeply offended if anyone told her anything bad about her mac and cheese so I should just find the right moment to tell her. He for some reason loves it, so he didn't want to be the one to tell her. Which I totally understand because it is MY issue and I had to deal with it. It's been almost 2 years of me pretending. \n\nSo 2 days ago I've decided to just tell her. It was a family dinner where my husband's parents had invited us over and of course, his mother was making her so-called \"famous mac and cheese\". I almost threw up at the smell and I couldn't bear the thought of eating it, probably because I was pregnant. \n\nSo at dinner, when I was offered the mac and cheese, I politely declined and said \"no thank you\". My mother in law looked at me and asked \"why? You should eat. Good for the baby\". And I just went right out with it \"I'm sorry, but I don't like your mac and cheese. Everything else tastes delicious, but this is the one thing I simply cannot eat anymore\". She looked so deeply offended and she literally snapped \"well, thanks for being honest\" and didn't even look or speak to me for the rest of the evening. My husband was on my side and tried to speak to his mother, but all I know is that it didn't work because she has been cold to me ever since. \n\nWhat was wrong with the mac and cheese? Her \"perfecting the recipe\" ended up with this result: mac and cheese combined with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic. I don't have a problem with the greens or onion, but the rest tastes so disgustingly wrong with mac and cheese. \nHowever, the reason why I think I might have been an asshole is because like my husband said, she has been perfecting this recipe for years, her entire family clearly loves it, and I tell her that her \"perfected and loved\" mac and cheese is terrible. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nEdit. I did tell her that because I am pregnant it wasn't possible for me to stomach the ingredients, but she still didn't want to talk to me.\nAnother edit. I'm French and my husband's family is Korean, so that will explain the ingredients. I do enjoy salmon, kimchi, and seaweed salads, but it greatly depends on which dishes it's served with. \nAnd since I've been pregnant, I've even developed an aversion to several foods that I used to love.", "created_utc": 1690819308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ek5hy/aita_for_finally_telling_my_mother_in_law_that/", "score": 9637, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Normally I\u2019d say you should just suck it up and pick at it on your plate, then say everything else was so good you filled up too soon.

On the other hand, she shouldn\u2019t be pressuring you on what you should eat as a grown woman, pregnant or not, but on top of that should be more understanding to the appetite changes and nausea that comes with pregnancy.

You list random ingredients like Salmon and Kimchi to sway us to your side... but I can rightfully see through that here. She's putting a twist on Mac n Cheese, you're allowed not to like it.

It is some kind pot luck Frankenstein concoction. \n\nNow if you had said she added different kinds of cheese or different macaroni noodles then yes maybe, but that concoction is not mac and cheese.

Geez.", "YTA.  You could\u2019ve softened it.  You should\u2019ve just said with the pregnancy, you can\u2019t tolerate certain tastes, smells, etc. or that you\u2019re allergic to some ingredient in it. Kimchi would\u2019ve been my choice.  Sounds absolutely disgusting to me but to each their own.", "NTA.  That recipe sounds like someone\u2019s garbage can after takeout from 6 different restaurants.", "YTA. I mean, you probably shouldve just said what you said in your edit instead of telling her that you hated it.

You're perfectly in your right not to like it, but you gotta maintain a relationship with the woman\n\nI personally think her recipe sounds very much worth a try lol. The only thing in there that sounds a little whack is the pineapple, but the sweetness might really add something. Adding a slice of american cheese (like Kraft slices) to ramen is something that's pretty popular in Asia these days, and it sounds gross, but it weirdly works. It's OK you don't like it, but no need to shit on everyone else\n\nETA: I'd totally try the recipe to see what it tastes like. There's a lot of delicious Asian food that I'd prefer not to know what the ingredients are, but doesn't mean it doesn't taste damn good.", "NTA. First off that so called recipe sounds disgusting. \n\nSecondly, you politely turned her down. She is the one that badgered you for an answer. There's a rule \"Don't ask questions that you don't want an answer to \". She wouldn't let it go and demanded an answer right then and there, you were simply honest. All these Y T A responses seem to be missing this point. \n\nSounds like either your husband's family has broken taste buds, or they eat it and pretend to love it because they know MiL would freak out otherwise. Either way you're not obligated to suffer through that for her ego.", "I'm super proud of many of the meals I make, and many people tell me they love my cooking, but some people don't like certain meals I make.

We are very excited and blessed because I've had some complications in getting pregnant. I have a very good relationship with my in laws and if any of us ever had problem, we are able to talk it through. Except for one thing. My mother in law has her famous mac and cheese that everyone in her family absolutely loves. \n\nI, however, found it disgusting on day 1 but I didn't want to come off as rude and ungrateful so I pulled through it without saying anything. I told my husband about it and he said that his mother has been making it for decades perfecting the recipe and she would be deeply offended if anyone told her anything bad about her mac and cheese so I should just find the right moment to tell her. He for some reason loves it, so he didn't want to be the one to tell her. Which I totally understand because it is MY issue and I had to deal with it. It's been almost 2 years of me pretending. \n\nSo 2 days ago I've decided to just tell her. It was a family dinner where my husband's parents had invited us over and of course, his mother was making her so-called \"famous mac and cheese\". I almost threw up at the smell and I couldn't bear the thought of eating it, probably because I was pregnant. \n\nSo at dinner, when I was offered the mac and cheese, I politely declined and said \"no thank you\". My mother in law looked at me and asked \"why? You should eat. Good for the baby\". And I just went right out with it \"I'm sorry, but I don't like your mac and cheese. Everything else tastes delicious, but this is the one thing I simply cannot eat anymore\". She looked so deeply offended and she literally snapped \"well, thanks for being honest\" and didn't even look or speak to me for the rest of the evening. My husband was on my side and tried to speak to his mother, but all I know is that it didn't work because she has been cold to me ever since. \n\nWhat was wrong with the mac and cheese? Her \"perfecting the recipe\" ended up with this result: mac and cheese combined with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic. I don't have a problem with the greens or onion, but the rest tastes so disgustingly wrong with mac and cheese. \nHowever, the reason why I think I might have been an asshole is because like my husband said, she has been perfecting this recipe for years, her entire family clearly loves it, and I tell her that her \"perfected and loved\" mac and cheese is terrible. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA Wait. So you decided to tell her at a family dinner? Why even say anything at all. Just politely refuse and say your stomach is upset.  Wtf. Who cares if YOU don\u2019t like it.

Why tell her when you know it would just hurt her feelings? Just say \u201coh I get sick when I eat Mac and cheese because of the pregnancy\u201d. I don\u2019t get why put your family through that.", "NTA pre, during and future post pregnancy.  That macaroni and cheese that you described that was \"perfected\" is culinary assault. That sounds wretched. I think she's really just doing it because she knows it's lousy and she just wanted to see what she could get away with and for how long because it's a power thing. I'm gratified to see that your husband stuck up for you in the moment and try to talk his mother down.", "The salmon, kimchi and pineapple sound absolutely disgusting to be combined with mac n cheese. That is very odd mixture of flavors and since its so out there of a combination that even I would not want, im going with nta. Maybe you can say it that way and see if she can portion you a plate without those additions. Nta due to very odd mixture of ingredients.", "YTA - That was awful timing and delivery.

Mac and cheese is so good because it's simple and should taste the same all the time no matter where you eat it.

It sounds gross.", "Your big mistake was not stopping this early on. Like telling her that you're allergic or have a medical reason or just can't stand one (or more) of the ingredients. Or even just that you don't care for mac & cheese.\n\nAt this point, 5 years later, you should've blamed it on the pregnancy hormones.\n\nI can understand that she's hurt, but once you declined, she should have backed off and not pushed the issue.\n\nTry to mend things with her, if for no other reasons than so that she can and your baby can have a good relationship without tensions between you two, and to avoid awkwardness for your husband", "NTA. You weren't rude about it, we can't all like the same things, her behaviour is childish. That aside, that Mac and cheese sounds like the stuff of nightmares, absolutely dreadful", "NTA.

Yeah its gross, but that besides the point.  The OP didn't handle it the right way and seems like was a bit rude?  She could have been more tactful.

From what has been said, and indicated, there would have been no saving face or saving the conversation for a later date or time for a private conversation. It would have been loudly announced to everyone most likely anyways. MIL would have likely made OP eat it and commented on every delayed bite and proudly proclaimed how everyone usually loves how perfect it is. It's called guilt tripping.", "I think this was forced by the MIL.  She wouldn't accept a polite \"No, thank you\".", "seriously. poor husband dealing with this bs drama from a grown adult", "So, what you are saying then, is if someone is lying to be polite to you and suffering through the meal, their taste buds change, they are dealing with hay fever or an illness,  or they become pregnant that you cannot take this sudden change of opinion. Additionally, that the odds that someone saying \"it's fine\" or \"it's great\" to avoid a slew of questions and thus embarrassing themselves or everyone else is a sin. \n\n... did I miss anything?\n\nOP's husband told her not to say anything about not liking it. She could have been disrespectful of his wishes and talked to MIL two years prior anyways. However, I am assuming your verdict wouldn't have ultimately changed then, would have it?", "Was it tactless? Sure, but hear me out. I\u2019ve been pregnant and I\u2019ve had swarms of people try to offer me food, and even when being polite and defaulting to my nausea some individuals\u2026just don\u2019t take the hint. They keep insisting their food choice or dish will help. And then the nausea gets worse, sometimes I could barely stand, and in the end you just get at your wits end and say something tactless to get the person to leave you alone. Pregnancy nausea was unlike any nausea I have felt. I lost over 15lbs my first trimester from it.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s not clear from the post of OP was at this level of pain, but I still am not convinced that after years of eating this Mac and cheese catastrophe and then having to attempt to stomach it while also pregnant if I would\u2019ve had the tact to continue politely declining. And even if I did, I\u2019m not sure if the lack of tact alone makes her an AH. I\u2019d say NAH since MIL isn\u2019t an AH for making a horror show of a dish that apparently everyone else in the family seems to love, and OP isn\u2019t necessarily one for being physically sick of it either.", ">considering that you\u2019ve been pretending to like the dish for 2 YEARS it\u2019s not that crazy that she didn\u2019t understand why you were saying no this time.\n\nI mean... it's pretty well known that pregnancy can change people's sensory likes and dislikes pretty radically. If my pregnant daughter-in-law suddenly said no to something she'd eaten without complaint before, I wouldn't start interrogating her about *why*, I'd just assume it was a pregnancy issue and make a mental note to not serve it again in her presence until after she'd given birth. And even afterwards, I'd approach it carefully bearing in mind that some pregnancy sensory changes aren't temporary.", "Lmao.

It's so obvious. It would have been so easy.", "This is exactly the way I would have handled it, too.  I don't think it's cowardly; like ChillBug3669, I think this would be a wonderfully tactful way to deal with it.  Although the first time I had been served it, I wouldn't have eaten it again.

Pasta, cheese sauce, tinned tuna and corn and chopped onion (at least that's the way my family makes it, other families may differ).\n\nAlso pasta with smoked salmon in a creamy sauce is quite popular here too. Not to mention smoked salmon tends to pair well with cream cheese in a whole variety of dishes.", "I've never loved milk but when I was pregnant I would gag on it.

(That being said, I\u2019m not a big fan of Mac n cheese in the first place - for me it\u2019s one of those weird American things that people eat more for tradition than anything else. The ones I\u2019ve tried haven\u2019t really tasted anything - macaroni and cheese literally doesn\u2019t really taste much in itself)", "Lol, good sir or madam, I to want this to be fake.

It is wrong to call it awful in front of the cook when the rest of the family likes it is just bad form.", "Why did there need to be a conflict though.  A million other things could have been said.

NTA for not liking it!\n\nSoft YTA for a big cultural faux pas. Korean culture is very face-saving and elder-respecting. You disrespected her specialty in front of the whole family and left her no way to save face.\n\nHusband was wrong here - he should probably have taken her aside and said, \u201cOP is having food issues due to this pregnancy. She can\u2019t eat your mac and cheese. You are an amazing grandma even before birth - could you make your famous [org dish] instead for her and baby? She is also happy to bring food for herself.\u201d\n\nThen MIL would have saved face by saying \u201cof course she doesn\u2019t need to bring her own food!\u201d and making something else or making two dishes so she could brag about taking care of both you and baby. And you could \u201crespect your elders\u201d by thanking her graciously. This way you both get to be gracious.\n\nFrench culture is more direct and egalitarian and damn if that wasn\u2019t quite the clash. She did not appreciate your honesty.\n\nI have no idea how to repair that kind of thing in MILs culture. Maybe a private apology and blame the pregnancy hormones freely to give you both an out?\n\nI\u2019d ask some Korean women how they would fix this with an older relative. Your husband is not doing a good job at navigating this.", "That's how it is in my family with my sister's chicken noodles... Until this year my dad let me in on the secret. I personally have never liked them, they taste really bland. This was supposedly my grandma, on my mom's side, recipe. I don't quite remember how her's tasted though, so who am I to say different? \n\nEaster this year, my dad was already upset that my sister took her time getting to my house. She offered to cook if I gave up my home for the dinner. (Her place is too small). She was over an hour late from the time she gave us and my dad eats on a schedule. He's diabetic so he kinda needs to stay on that schedule. When he was venting I told him what she was bringing and he just chose to go ahead and eat, cause he didn't like her version and didn't realize that was the food we were waiting on. I agreed that it wasn't that great, but that it's my brother's favorite so she always makes it. He was like, \"ya, that's not actually true. Your brother told me it's just the only thing he can stomach that she makes and she won't burn the house down when she makes it. That's also not your grandma's recipe. Idk what that is, but your grandma's was a lot better.\" I had to laugh at how hangry he was, but I still ate her noodles.", "Kimchi mac and cheese is a relatively common fusion combo.

In this case, there\u2019s like 5 very powerful ingredients while Mac n cheese is already a very strong flavor", "Some people are manipulative and get sulky when their ego is not constantly stroked. This sounds like MIL. The effect these people have on families is that everyone in the family gets in the habit of constantly assuring them they\u2019re doing GREAT and never, ever saying anything that could POSSIBLY be construed as criticism (even if logically it is not.) They just get so scared of upsetting the balance. It\u2019s possible that MIL is this person to her family.", "And those aversions sometimes stick around long after the baby is born.

I'm asian & that combo sounds disgusting, but Asians will almost always push food on you, it's how we show love.

I learned from my doctor though that part of my aversion to lentils is because I\u2019ve always been anemic, so eating a food so high in fiber and iron is weird to my body and hits me hard - usually causing severe nausea. Before my husband and his family, I also had never tried lentils before and definitely not curried lentils. Everyone else devours it, but I just don\u2019t include the curried lentils in my food when she makes it. Or the mashed potatoes.\n\nETA: I have a really sensitive digestive system and a bunch of health problems, so I can\u2019t always eat what I want and certain foods cause nausea or other symptoms, so even when I want to eat it, it\u2019s at a high cost.", "It's their own family version of Fear Factor -- who can eat the most of it and not barf?", "Pretty sure it's called this all over the US, because it's Philly cream cheese", "I think you could totally do kimchi in mac & cheese, but ONLY kimchi.
