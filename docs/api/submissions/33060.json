She said that I might give her a complex about her skin tone. I told her that she would thank me in the future.\n\nEdited to add:   My wife is white. I am not.

Just sayin lol.", "NTA", "Your daughter should be wearing sunscreen to protect her from sun damage and to help prevent skin cancer.  You're right, she will thank you in the future when she is older but looks years younger because she protected her skin from sun damage.", "NTA\nIt's very natural to want your children to look good. It's a convenient psychological mechanism to ensure your children's health because in a lot of cases prettiness is an indicator of health. For example if your child has crooked teeth, you should insist on dental procedures, and your primary motivation can be to make the child prettier, but in reality those same dental procedures will save their teeth in the future and will drastically improve their quality of life later. Or for example when older relatives see a very skinny child their natural reaction is to complain and try to feed the child more, because a healthy looking child is more likely to actually be healthy.\n\nAs for the skin tone, I think I know what you're talking about. I've seen some people with weird tan. One girl had a tan that made her look dirty. It was very weird because similar looking girls in a summer camp had almost the exact same naturally pale skin with the same colored hair, but their tan looked very nice. Only that one girl had her tan weirdly uneven, and not patchy, it had smooth gradients, but nevertheless she was looking unkempt. Also one boy at my school tended to tan very deep brown in summer and then became snowy white in winter, and both extremes looked bad on him. And I don't know what happened to the girl, but the boy learned what was the best level of tan for his appearance, and he did that because people actively told him he looked ridiculous in summer.\n\nGrowing up people should learn how to maintain their appearance. And that is why, as a family member, you absolutely should tell your children if something looks bad on them. Criticizing your children's looks cannot give them a complex if you're an involved parent, the same way as healthy criticizing their grades or behavior can't do that. A good parent doesn't say anything bad to their child just for the sake of it, the parent helps the child to learn about all the aspects of life and gives them feedback, positive and negative. At the moment the children think their parents are being mean every time they say something that they don't like, or make them do something they don't like. But it's also natural. You can't be afraid of giving your child a complex every time you make them do chores or don't allow them to wear certain clothes. It's parenting.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
