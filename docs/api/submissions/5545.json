But his reaction was very excessive.  I'm not a morning person, but slamming doors? Come on.", "My husband is a complete asshole when he gets woken up abruptly, gets interrupted sleep, or has to get up too early. He immediately leads with the same pissy attitude. I let him be since his attitude adjusts once he's fully awake and his grumpiness is not my responsibility to fix. If he wants to take the world's most petulant shower that's fine, it doesn't hurt anyone. If he gets sideways with me I say, \"I won't pay attention to anything you say when you're Morning Grumpy\" or \"Try that again when you're actually awake,\" and that reminds him he is a right bastard when groggy. It calms him down and keeps us from getting into fights. \n\nAfter similarly trying to be helpful about work and getting my head bitten off, I don't wake him when he's late anymore. He knows he is solely responsible for being at work on time and can't count on me to wake him up, and doesn't oversleep anymore.\n\nAnyway all that to say NAH, mixed morning tolerance marriages can be a big adjustment. He wasn't fully awake and you were trying to help. But some free advice is to stop trying to do what would make you happy in the mornings (being woken up on time for work, being woken up with a surprise), and let your husband experience the consequences of his surly attitude (like being late for work!) until he learns to handle it without taking it out on anyone else.", "Clearly NTA but if someone is groggy and moody waking up and they clearly need space like he was exhibiting - back off.

I get it that you tried to do a bunch of nice things but for some people surprise awakenings, especially when they tell you to stop is just brutal. TBH I'd be pretty pissed and probably have a headache if my wife did that to me. \n\nNow that being said he clearly needs to work on his morning routine because it's really not healthy to sleep right up until you leave for work. Also his attitude towards you was a bit over the top.", "YTA - sorry.  He gets up and has between 15 and 25 minutes to dress, wash, eat, and head for work.  Sounds as if he is not a morning person to start with.\n\nIt was kind of you to warm the car up etc BUT if he had opened your present would you then have been pouting because he had to rush off to work rather than spend ages admiring it, thanking you etc?\n\nIt is less than 24 hours until the official Christmas present opening time - when presumably he will not have to rush off to work and you can all sit down and enjoy the day together.", ">He told me to stop but I kept going.\n\nYTA \n\nyou clearly had good intentions, but you put your excitement ahead of his feelings\n\nI hope y'all can work things out after you've both had some time to cool down x", "YTA\n\nThat's a miserable way to wake up, someone jumping in the bed and demanding immediate attention.

If you planned to do this then you should\u2019ve told him the night before that you would like to give him a gift in the morning", "YTA. How many times did he ask you to stop? Did you listen?

WTF? The man needs to get to work, not celebrate Christmas right now.\n\nI dunno, give him some space. You have a newborn; you're probably both sleep deprived and need to cut each other some slack.", "YTA. I cannot stand for someone to pester the crap out of me in the morning.

Just hold onto it, you\u2019ll only reward his behavior if you give it to him now. My ex did this and I would still give the gift even without the apology and things never got better but there was also other issues.", "Oh yea YTA - I\u2019d have been PISSED! This is a terrible way to treat someone who is clearly not a morning person and I\u2019m blown away that you even thought this would play out any other way than it did.", "YTA.\nA mild one, but an AH nonetheless.\n\nYOU were excited to give to give him a gift. HE was *asleep*! A toddler jumping on the bed when they are excited is entirely different from a grown adult. He was even running late, and you admit you kept pushing *after he asked you to stop*.\n\nYes, he overreacted, but not all of us wake up gracefully. Even worse when someone is jumping around all excited before I've even opened my eyes. He's late for work, you're pushing him to move faster (get up, get ready, open my present!!!!)...I'd be pretty cranky, too.", "ESH.

Your husband needs to apologize for being a dick. And also sounds like he\u2019s causing himself unnecessary stress by always waking up right before he has to leave in the morning.", "NTA, I get why he was grumpy but I don't think you deserved how he reacted altogether.", "You are definitely NTA. Your husband is.  Everything about what you were doing was for his benefit,  getting him up in time for work,  warming his car,  getting an extremely special gift,  and being so excited to make him happy that you were acting like a little kid.  Everything about that is endearing and adorable.  Your husband kind of sucks.  I'm sorry:(", "NTA- your heart and excitement were in the right place but not necessarily the right time as clearly husband waits till the very last moment to get up to go to work and not into it. He definitely needs to work on his morning routine now that you have a baby it\u2019s not fair for him to leave everything for you in the morning", "NTA but you will be if you don't take that present back. He's an AH. You need a better life than to wake up to do a person.", "[deleted]", "NTA because you did everything in good faith, but that sounds like a rough wake up call and even worse if he told you to stop and kept going.

Just talk to each other and each say sorry.", "Take the gift back. He is the AH. Do not beat yourself up.", "NAH. I think from his perspective you were pestering him to go to work, and even once you had made him very well aware of the fact he needed to leave, you didn't stop there and told him you'd started the car. This would make me feel like your trying to get rid of me/forcing me somewhere.\n\nI think if you were excited to give him his gift, you should have mentioned that you had something to give him rather than making the conversation about work.\n\nThe door slamming sounds a bit worrying. Hope you two can talk this through and enjoy the festivities together.", "NTA, If you did that to me, I can't say I would be happy but I wouldn't have a hissy fit and start slamming doors, especially if you are also waking him up for work.", "NTA but some mornings are hard. I assume you didn't give him the present.  Focus on how it will turn his day from bad to good when he opens it tonight and can then enjoy it without the pressure of going straight to work.", "Coming from a guys perspective nta. I hate, and when I say hate it's the understatement of the millennium, being woken up by anything other than myself.

But I have slammed a door on the way out of my house because I was so annoyed I had to be awake before, so I didn't assume it was that. But I could be wrong! (If it's that, OP, I would love to connect you with some resources)", "His feelings of annoyance that someone jumped on him in bed and won't get out of his face the second he woke up.", "It sounds more like he was upset about HOW she woke him up and that he was going to be late to work.  Agree to disagree. Happy Holidays", "Haaaaa I wish. My son is a year old, and I'm *so glad* I'm usually up before him now because getting woken by a baby who is whining because he's wet and hungry (which is what woke him most days) and having to get up and deal *now* ... did not make me a morning person lol", "I think he can handle it that one time. Regardless of the fact he had to wake up either way.", "YTA for warming up a car more than 5 minutes. It\u2019s not necessary and not good for the environment.", "Does he always act like you are a complete inconvenience? Don\u2019t wake him up for work, don\u2019t heat his car up and don\u2019t give him his gift. Any man that slams a door so hard that it breaks because his gf was excited about giving him a gift needs a wake up call. NTA the man was getting up for work anyways and you did him a god damn favour.", "I'm stuck on this.... are you normally in charge of waking him up in the mornings? Because you made it sound that way. He's a grown man with a job and a child. He should be able to wake up by himself. \n\nThat said... he also doesn't sound like a morning person. As his wife, maybe you should have known to not try and do exciting morning things. Read the room. (Don't get me wrong... I also don't think being a morning person excuses him from acting like a jerk).\n\nESH", "NTA but he needs to be in charge of waking himself up and getting to work on time. Wash your hands of that, it's his responsibility.", "I font see what the gift gas to do with anything, he was late to get up, you woke him, he snapped.\nNTA", "NTA- my boyfriend is NOT a morning person. I save any questions for him for until after he\u2019s had his energy drink and starts talking more on his own. He\u2019s grumpy and surly until he wakes up, and I had to learn to not take it personally. Outside of mornings, he is the sweetest person ever, he just does NOT do mornings. I however, LOVE mornings. I would just give him some space, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around and apologize.", "Even if I really need to be up, waking me up by being obnoxious is going to make me ask like an ass. And yes, IMO, you jumping on the bed and then refusing to stop would be considered obnoxious. \n\nESH", "NAH. This isn\u2019t worth the argument. \nI am a morning grump. I would NOT react kindly for being jumped awake in the morning, even if you were there to award me a million bucks. You married the guy- don\u2019t you know his AM tendencies? \nHe also was late for work and needed to drag his out out of the bed like a big boy.", "I am not a morning person. I need quiet and alone time to start my day and feel human before I go into work. Being woken abruptly ruins my morning. I can see being incredibly annoyed, but to start screaming and slamming doors is concerning behaviour.\n\nIf he's your husband you should know his routines and personality by now and what makes him tick", "[removed]", "ESH \"stop\" and \"no\" are words we need to respect. So you're a major asshole for that. \n\nHis reaction was that of a toddler, but he can be redeemed if he apologizes for how he was and you can be redeemed if you apologize for how you were. You both need to apologize.", "YTA. He was probably just trying to get through the day. It sucks working on Christmas Eve, and he probably wasn't in a good mood about it, then was overwhelmed by your positive energy that early in the morning after a long week.", "Being woken up is the worst feeling ever and it is hard to act rationally in that condition, especially when you only have a few minutes before you have to leave for work. YTA for waking him up, but your intent was good. i just wouldn't take his grumpiness personally and get discouraged about giving him his gift. He is only human and will be in a better mood and have more time to enjoy his gift after work.", "Nta. He is.", "Trying to help by jumping on the bed while he's asleep, what a saint", "If she would have stoped then he likely would have gone back to sleep and would\u2019ve been late for work. Which would likely make him mad at her for another reason.", "Adult? 21 is not an adult in terms of brain development and maturity.  I\u2019ve rarely heard of a successful marriage where you\u2019re married with a child at 21. 95% of situations like that that I have seen end in divorce.  You don\u2019t even know who you really are at 21\u2026", "he shouldn't apologize he told her to stop and she kept going", "\"He told me to stop but i kept going\" she to blame for being childish", ">He told me to stop but I kept going\n\nYeah he's abusive lmao.", "can't you read", "I find it quite concerning to see how many downvotes this has.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "From this limited info it appears he's a living illustration of how procrastination causes stress.", "Yeah he needs to pick one:\n\n1. Waking me up for work is her responsibility.\n2. I get to act like a dick when I am woken up.\n\nIt cannot be both.", "Don\u2019t you brush your teeth?  \ud83d\ude1c", "Maybe he should leave himself more than 12 minutes between opening his eyes and needing to be at work.", "That I can see and agree with! Happy Holidays!", "Yup. If she pissed naked while brushing teeth, it wouldn't add that much time.", "Maybe wife can handle someone getting pissy at her childish behavior just one time or is that too much?", "Lol I\u2019ll brush my teeth in 2 min shower. How do I know it\u2019s 2 min? Cuz elec toothbrush turns off after 2 min \ud83d\ude10", "She was just excited to give him a present? Wth is wrong with you. He had to get up anyways and was already late. It\u2019s not like she unnecessarily woke him up.\n\nHim getting mad at her about her heating up his car already and aggressively slamming doors is crazy.", "Except she did unnecessarily wake him up. Nothing in her post preludes to her ever having to wake him up\u2026.\n\nAnd jumping up and down on someone? That\u2019s a great way to wake someone up!\n\nHe asked her to stop, she kept going. YTA OP", "She did have to wake him up? As he was literally late for work?? \n\nBased on his reaction, He would\u2019ve went batshit crazy if he found out she purposely let him sleep in and miss work and face some serious consequences."]}
