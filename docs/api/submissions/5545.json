While I was taking care of our newborn, I had realized it was 8:12 and went out to start his car up since it had snowed the night before. I came in and jumped in bed like a kid on Christmas morning and was asking him to get up, get ready, and to open up my present. He did not take too kindly to this. He leaves the house around 8:25 every day for work so I was also trying to get him up and ready for work as well. I was pushing on him telling him that he needs to get up for work. He told me to stop but I kept going. I told him I warmed up the car for him and his comeback was \u201cWell I didn\u2019t ask for that!\u201d He immediately got an attitude and started slamming doors and being very frustrated. \n\nI was no longer excited to give him his gift anymore at this point. He came into the living room, already late for work. We tried taking it out but he was still mad at me for waking him that that he slammed the door so hard on the way out that it wouldn\u2019t even close.

He had asked me to stop but I kept going. I didn\u2019t listen to him after he had warned me that he was getting mad. So I felt I was the asshole I\u2019m that sort of sense because his action justified how he felt.

But his reaction was very excessive.  I'm not a morning person, but slamming doors? Come on.", "My husband is a complete asshole when he gets woken up abruptly, gets interrupted sleep, or has to get up too early. He immediately leads with the same pissy attitude. I let him be since his attitude adjusts once he's fully awake and his grumpiness is not my responsibility to fix. If he wants to take the world's most petulant shower that's fine, it doesn't hurt anyone. If he gets sideways with me I say, \"I won't pay attention to anything you say when you're Morning Grumpy\" or \"Try that again when you're actually awake,\" and that reminds him he is a right bastard when groggy. It calms him down and keeps us from getting into fights. \n\nAfter similarly trying to be helpful about work and getting my head bitten off, I don't wake him when he's late anymore. He knows he is solely responsible for being at work on time and can't count on me to wake him up, and doesn't oversleep anymore.\n\nAnyway all that to say NAH, mixed morning tolerance marriages can be a big adjustment. He wasn't fully awake and you were trying to help. But some free advice is to stop trying to do what would make you happy in the mornings (being woken up on time for work, being woken up with a surprise), and let your husband experience the consequences of his surly attitude (like being late for work!) until he learns to handle it without taking it out on anyone else.", "Clearly NTA but if someone is groggy and moody waking up and they clearly need space like he was exhibiting - back off. He also is giving me anxiety with sleeping in so close till the time he needs to leave\ud83d\ude02 let him be late next time and he\u2019ll manage time better", "Yta 'he told me to stop but I kept going' so you pushed, pushed, pushed, and are super shocked he snapped?\n\nYour excitement doesn't over ride his feelings.", "ESH... I get it that you tried to do a bunch of nice things but for some people surprise awakenings, especially when they tell you to stop is just brutal. TBH I'd be pretty pissed and probably have a headache if my wife did that to me. \n\nNow that being said he clearly needs to work on his morning routine because it's really not healthy to sleep right up until you leave for work. Also his attitude towards you was a bit over the top.", "YTA - sorry.  He gets up and has between 15 and 25 minutes to dress, wash, eat, and head for work.  Sounds as if he is not a morning person to start with.\n\nIt was kind of you to warm the car up etc BUT if he had opened your present would you then have been pouting because he had to rush off to work rather than spend ages admiring it, thanking you etc?\n\nIt is less than 24 hours until the official Christmas present opening time - when presumably he will not have to rush off to work and you can all sit down and enjoy the day together.", ">He told me to stop but I kept going.\n\nYTA \n\nyou clearly had good intentions, but you put your excitement ahead of his feelings\n\nI hope y'all can work things out after you've both had some time to cool down x", "YTA\n\nThat's a miserable way to wake up, someone jumping in the bed and demanding immediate attention. Also, when people say \"stop\", and you don't stop, you should expect them to get pissed off.", "YTA just because you\u2019re excited doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok to expect someone else to go from 0 to 60 in a finger snap. Let the man wake up and get his feet under him. Gift giving is a two way street. Make sure the recipient is in the right place before demanding gifts be opened. If you planned to do this then you should\u2019ve told him the night before that you would like to give him a gift in the morning", "YTA. How many times did he ask you to stop? Did you listen? A lot of people don't wake up easy or fast. Get to know that about your partner. \n\nYes, he had to get to work. But that is on him.", "YTA don't jump on people to wake them up and expect a thank you", "YTA. There is not a person in my life that would risk their life to wake me 1) early when I have to work 2) jumping on the bed", "ESH. Him - because he's an adult, and should be responsible enough to wake up for work.\n\nYou - for knowing that he has to leave for work in 13 minutes and is already late, and trying to make those minutes where he's rushing around about opening a present because you're excited about it. WTF? The man needs to get to work, not celebrate Christmas right now.\n\nI dunno, give him some space. You have a newborn; you're probably both sleep deprived and need to cut each other some slack.", "YTA. I cannot stand for someone to pester the crap out of me in the morning. He was literally asleep!  This would definitely trigger me to be in a bad mood, especially if the person was told to stop.", "Your a adult correct? So you decided the best time to give it to him would be in the morning while he was running late? Knowing he isn't a morning person and now your upset cause he wasn't happy....learn to meditated cause you need to learn patience", "You are not the asshole for waking up your husband, although your technique may need some work. I don't like people that happy in the morning either ;-)   \nGift giving is an art, not only choosing the gift, but also choosing when to give it. I understand your excitement, and I'm sure your hubby will be as excited when he gets home from work, or tomorrow morning when he finds it under the tree. NTA", "NTA, he needed to get up for work anyways and you made it easier for him by starting the car. Waking up to some one jumping on the bed is not fun but your excited so it\u2019s an easy thing to let slide. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t apologize soon, don\u2019t give him the gift yet. Just hold onto it, you\u2019ll only reward his behavior if you give it to him now. My ex did this and I would still give the gift even without the apology and things never got better but there was also other issues.", "Oh yea YTA - I\u2019d have been PISSED! This is a terrible way to treat someone who is clearly not a morning person and I\u2019m blown away that you even thought this would play out any other way than it did.", "YTA.\nA mild one, but an AH nonetheless.\n\nYOU were excited to give to give him a gift. HE was *asleep*! A toddler jumping on the bed when they are excited is entirely different from a grown adult. He was even running late, and you admit you kept pushing *after he asked you to stop*.\n\nYes, he overreacted, but not all of us wake up gracefully. Even worse when someone is jumping around all excited before I've even opened my eyes. He's late for work, you're pushing him to move faster (get up, get ready, open my present!!!!)...I'd be pretty cranky, too.", "ESH. I hate too much commotion going on early in the morning and it irritates the daylights out of me when I have to get ready for work. I think you should\u2019ve stopped when he asked you to, but he was wrong for such a strong reaction.", "I'm willing to give him a little benefit of the doubt because he was running late for work and was probably stressed by it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He sounds like a petulant teenager.", "Info:  Did you jump ON the bed or into bed?  Your post said you jumped IN bed. \n\nI'm one of the morning grumps. I honestly have no frame of reference for things that are happening for a good hour or so after I wake up. If someone woke me up by jumping on the bed, I'd be ridiculously angry, and I wouldn't be able to control it, so I totally get his response. \n\nIs he a morning grump usually, or did he have shit sleep, and this is unusual? \n\nI'm sorry your excitement got squashed, tho.\n\nI'm rating a soft YTA because if you've scared someone awake essentially, that rarely will go well.", "NTA I can\u2019t imagine doing all those nice things for someone and then they wake up like a petulant child and break a door. A normal person would thank you for waking them up so they wouldn\u2019t miss work. Is it normal for him to do that when you do nice things for him? \n\nI would be over the moon if someone woke me so I didn\u2019t miss work, started my car AND wanted to give me a gift. Your husband needs to apologize for being a dick. And also sounds like he\u2019s causing himself unnecessary stress by always waking up right before he has to leave in the morning.", "NTA, I get why he was grumpy but I don't think you deserved how he reacted altogether.", "You are definitely NTA. Your husband is.  Everything about what you were doing was for his benefit,  getting him up in time for work,  warming his car,  getting an extremely special gift,  and being so excited to make him happy that you were acting like a little kid.  Everything about that is endearing and adorable.  Your husband kind of sucks.  I'm sorry:(", "NTA- your heart and excitement were in the right place but not necessarily the right time as clearly husband waits till the very last moment to get up to go to work and not into it. He definitely needs to work on his morning routine now that you have a baby it\u2019s not fair for him to leave everything for you in the morning", "NTA but you will be if you don't take that present back. He's an AH. You need a better life than to wake up to do a person.", "[deleted]", "NTA because you did everything in good faith, but that sounds like a rough wake up call and even worse if he told you to stop and kept going. Stop means stop in my world.", "YTA", "NTA. Nor is he probably - some people are just very groggy and not morning people. Especially with a newborn in the house. Just talk to each other and each say sorry.", "Take the gift back. He is the AH. Do not beat yourself up.", "NAH. I think from his perspective you were pestering him to go to work, and even once you had made him very well aware of the fact he needed to leave, you didn't stop there and told him you'd started the car. This would make me feel like your trying to get rid of me/forcing me somewhere.\n\nI think if you were excited to give him his gift, you should have mentioned that you had something to give him rather than making the conversation about work.\n\nThe door slamming sounds a bit worrying. Hope you two can talk this through and enjoy the festivities together.", "NTA, If you did that to me, I can't say I would be happy but I wouldn't have a hissy fit and start slamming doors, especially if you are also waking him up for work.", "NTA but some mornings are hard. I assume you didn't give him the present.  Focus on how it will turn his day from bad to good when he opens it tonight and can then enjoy it without the pressure of going straight to work.", "Coming from a guys perspective nta. I hate, and when I say hate it's the understatement of the millennium, being woken up by anything other than myself. If my wife woke me up it's an infinite levels better than being woken up by my alarm clock. Nta, this whole ordeal seems odd for one particular instance unless this is a common occurrence", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My family of origin had a similar drill to yours on holidays where they woke me up, put a cup of coffee in my hand, and left me alone until I became a human person. \n\nIf you want to cure your Morning Grump, apparently the only solution is to have a child.
