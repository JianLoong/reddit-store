But I wouldn\u2019t be willing to risk it.  Your wife doesn\u2019t owe her mother a do-over mothering experience with her own child.  I\u2019d suggest getting your wife into some therapy.", "You\u2019re NTA. Why did her mother take so long to reconnect with your gf, and is she reunited with the siblings as well?", "I have a feeling  she wants  the alone time so she can  fantasize  she's  his mother  not grandmother  and that to me points  to a mental health  issue.", "Do we know if the child in question is being breastfed? (Not arguing, just wondering if it was mentioned and I didn't see it)", "I\u2019m curious, have you ever breastfed a baby?", "Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t be trusting her alone with my newborn anytime soon.", "Yes, I breastfed two children for a year each. Why do you ask?", "Look , I get  you love your mom  but for the sake of your  child  get your boyfriend and go toghether  to a psychiatric or psychologist   consult where you tell ALL to the professional  and let them tell you their opinion  if what your mother  does and wants  are normal.  I don't  think  they are,sorry.  All the best for all of you.", "Do you think your bf\u2019s concerns are valid, or is he just being paranoid? I will add that I never left my kids overnight until they were preschool age. I felt it was important that they could communicate to me if there was anything distressing going on in our absence. I wasn\u2019t paranoid, I was cautious.", "Nta\n\nInfo: if your gf the primary care giver of your child? Most new mothers don't want to be separated from their child for so long. Is there a chance she's wanting to do this because she's feeling burnt out and needing a break?  If so maybe talk about ways she can get time to herself.\n\nI do agree it's Inappropriate and will cause unnecessary stress on your son. He's much to young to understand why he suddenly doesn't have his mom or dad the people he knows as safe around.. It will be stressful for him, confusing and honestly probably traumatic.\n\nI think longer visits like that are much more appropriate once the child is older.", "NTA \nMy children never slept anywhere without me.. 3 months is way to young", "3 months is too young to be away from the parents for so long. A few hours is one thing but leaving your baby with anyone for so long at this age is not a good idea, no matter who it is. \n\nAnd at 3 months the baby isn't going to know who she is anyway. It's not until they are much older that they start to recognize anyone other than their parents. So your girlfriend's mother's excuse for wanting him for so long does not compute. \n\nYou will need to find another way to explain to your girlfriend that you need to wait until your baby is much older. I am almost willing to bet that she doesn't want to leave her newborn baby with someone for 4 days but she is being pressured by her mom who sounds jealous and petty. \n\nI can tell you (from experience) that this is not going to be the last time you have to deal with this from her. It's best if you both present a united front and set boundaries now. \n\nIf her mom wants to spend more time with her grandbaby then she needs to be the one to make some comprises and come to you.", "I see my grandkids twice a year and they still jump out of their pants when they see me. We FaceTime and my DIL sends me tons of pictures. Her mother is up their butts and buys them all sorts of expensive shit. I do what I can and they still love me. A compromise needs to be reached!  NTA", "Nta. Is your gf's mom's legs broken? She can't drive to visit in your home? Nta", "NTA - I empathize with your girlfriends mother in law. I\u2019m sure she feels left out and maybe a little envious of how much access your mother has to your son. However, you make the effort to see her and make sure she has quality time! I\u2019m sorry this isn\u2019t an ideal situation. Can you guys schedule FaceTime or zoom dates once a week when you aren\u2019t able to travel to her? \n\nAt the end of the day 3 months is far too young to leave with someone who isn\u2019t a primary caretaker. You are totally valid in saying no. Even if your child was 9 years old you would still be valid in saying no because your child\u2019s well-being is your business. That\u2019s your right as a parent. It may hurt your MIL but boundaries are necessary.", "NTA. If you wanted a weekend break and you absolutely trusted her that\u2019d be amazing. But you guys have excellent reasons to not trust her and this arrangement is not one you\u2019re comfortable with. She just needs to come to you guys. That\u2019s not her baby and she doesn\u2019t get custody of him. If your girlfriend would like to visit her mother with her baby then that\u2019s different.", "NTA. My mother lives 7.5 hours away. While we don\u2019t live with my MIL, my in-laws offered to babysit when I had to go back to work. My mom was also worried that my son would not know her. My mom stayed at my house every other week to babysit. My son didn\u2019t start staying with her for extended periods of time until he was almost 2. I love my mother and have complete trust in her. She is a fantastic grandmother and mother. But there is NO WAY that my barely three month old would stay with her or my in-laws (who live in the same town) would stay overnights for extended times. That too little!!", "Oh hell no.  My MIL asked to take our then 4 month old for a few days because she was feeling down and wanted a pick me up or something.\nFirstly, our baby isn't her emotional support animal. Second, she lives about 4 hours away, including a 2 hour ferry ride. That was NOT happening.\n\nEta NTA", "NTA not only do you have a right to be concerned about this, cuz your baby is very young, I think it's also an issue that your partner is playing along with her mother's game when her mother is saying that she is viewing herself in competition with your mother.\n\nLike I think that's a huge issue, that she's trying to frame that not only should the baby, who's barely been in the world a few months, should have less of a relationship with your mother and more with her. Like I do think framing that your girlfriend and the baby need to make a pilgrimage to go see her mother to satisfy grandma is a huge issue not only in the immediate because the baby shouldn't be the one who has to travel to make sure that there's a relationship, I also think folding to her demands now will lead to more demands. And the fact that it's not that she wants her daughter to visit with her child, but she wants the baby left alone with her is a giant red flag.\n\nHow often will your girlfriend and her child be making trips to see her mom, will your partner actually diminish the amount of time your mom sees your kid because your girlfriend doesn't want her mom to get jealous? Given how extreme your girlfriend's reaction is you should be asking her these questions, because does she have poor boundaries with her mother because of her mother's loss issues? No matter what her mother's issues are, that doesn't mean that your whole baby's life should revolve around it", "Sorry but iqheb my baby was theee months old we ledt rhem with his family (MULTIPLE adults not just grandma) for two hours and thst was enough for me. \n\nTbh for BOTH parents to be away from a 3 month old for 4 days sounds insane. \n\nNTA", "Yeah I still haven\u2019t sent my 7month old to a sleepover at grandparents yet and they live in town. Not a chance I would send an infant on a 4 day getaway.", "NTA. This is way too early for a baby to be away from his parents for that long. OP, I would talk to your GF about planning something when the baby is MUCH older. Maybe something more like a trip, where you all stay there for a few days.", "In this situation it takes 2 \u201cyes\u2019\u201d to make a decision. A single \u201cno\u201d is a straight no. That\u2019s the way it works. Wife\u2019s mom needs to get a hotel room or find a place to stay if she wants to see the baby, but baby isn\u2019t going to know down the line that they once spent 4 days with grandma.", "This right here, it is to the detriment to the baby to do this not only for the time of separation, but by telling your mother-in-law that it is acceptable for her to treat the baby as an emotional toy", "OP should really show his wife this. It pretty much puts the entire argument to rest. If they can go visit a long weekend together it's one thing. OP also isn't saying no entirely, just not yet. It's way to soon to separate the infant from parents.", "It's on mother-in-law to come and see the baby. It's completely unreasonable for her to expect you all to pick up her slack and put the baby in a bad situation for her whims", "I mean it definitely a red flag that she was not in the life of her children for a while and makes such unreasonable demands now. Those two things are connected", "Ok so her car isn\u2019t working it needed to be fix so her boyfriends mom let them use her one sons car but since it\u2019s not my moms car she isn\u2019t allowed to bring it up here. She is getting a new car.", "An excellent point, not only is she emotionally not a safe caregiver for your child, she's also physically an unsafe caregiver", "I am his girlfriend this is a very Unnecessary, my mom does not need therapy to sort her issues out. A lot of these rude comments about my mother hurts me.", "Eventually getting a new car I meant to say", "Yes I think they valid and I see where he is coming from as well so I do agree now that he is to far young to be an hour and half away from us. But my mom would never hurt our son."]}
