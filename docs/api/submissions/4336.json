Or you two could go visit grandma and leave baby with her for an hour or two while you go out to eat or something. \n\nMy grandkids didn't start overnights with me until they were around 4-6 years old.

She really should work more hours or get a second job to pay for her car repairs so she can come up to visit.", "Never let her have him alone. That she is insisting is terrifying, especially given her history. Have you considered this may be a kidnapping attempt? Because it\u2019s awfully coincidental that someone hung up on replacing the experience of raising a child only got in touch when your wife was pregnant.", "It's not about trust. It's about you not being comfortable with that at such a young age.  Tell your wife that when the kid is old enough to talk, then the two of you can revisit this idea.", "NTA then. Your wife does have a say, yes, but her decision isn\u2019t particularly reasonable. They reconnected less than a year ago?! No way.", ">Taken as in CYS. \n\nOh! More than the actual details of why I think it's important to note that your GF only just started talking to her mom again a year ago. It's not like she's someone that you or your GF have spent a lot of time with recently . That makes her request more strange even if she is completely innocent.\nI think it's important to talk to your GF about it. I get that she was upset when it was brought up but you are uncomfortable with it. It's childcare so you both need to agree. MIL should be fine with driving down to visit you if you and GF are OK with that.", "Absolutely not in that case. At a year MIL is lucky to see the child. There's no way I'd trust her 4 days alone with a baby.", "I will say OP doesn't trust MIL. And he should be discussing that with his GF.", "Her mother's anger is a red flag. Less than a year of contact and making demands, then getting angry doesn't look like a doting granny.", "Yea i kinda figured that was the case. \n\nYall live with your mum and not hers for reasons tho and that counts. \n\n3 months is so small and new, i cant imagine what being away from the parents and with someone whos basically a stranger at that age would do to a kid. \n\nIs there a way to spend more time with MIL to build up familiarity and trust both with your baby and you as parents?? \n\nNo matter what you are NTA here. Theres gotta be a solution that isnt just sending your kid off for day at a time with someone they do know and you dont fully trust.", "OP, who takes care of the baby when you and your wife are at work?", "can she stay with you?", "Exactly! My mother wanted to see me when I had my son, knowing I wouldn\u2019t be happy leaving him without any parents, SHE flew from France to England to be meet and bond with her grandson. You are no way wrong here\u2026 your baby needs at least one parent around with them for overnight stays til at least 6-9 months old I\u2019d say! Even then it\u2019d have to be someone close who knows the routine you\u2019ve set and baby\u2019s emotion/ needs cues", "Yup, thanks, I saw OP's comments clarifying that. That clarified things enough for me that I think NTA. It's totally okay to let a trusted caregiver care for an infant, even that young and for that long, but OP has good reason not to trust MIL to do that.", "What you say doesn\u2019t matter. Maybe she is more comfortable having her mom help out. Maybe she needs more breaks then you do because she was pregnant and she had the baby. If this is something she wants then you need to find a compromise that works for her.", "3 months is perfectly old enough for stay a few days.  I have been through 2 children that age so maybe you didn't see I also have a 6 month old.  \n\nI think it is reasonable to be worried but reduce the length of stay don't outright refuse.", "Yep. And when our oldest was 4 months old, my in-laws cared for him while my husband and I went to a dear friend's wedding in Mexico for several days. It was totally fine. The sky did not fall. The kid is now 14 and happy and healthy.", "I did it on purpose. My husband and I went to Mexico for a dear friend's wedding and were gone for four days. We left our 4mo son with my perfectly competent in-laws who once raised their own children. Our son did perfectly fine, the sky did not fall, and he is now a happy, healthy 14yo. \n\nAgain, totally fine if someone doesn't want to do that, but JFC it's not a bad thing.", "or MIL could take a bus or ask a friend to drive her.\n\nif it is so important to her to spend this time with her grandchild, she will figure out transportation.", "Someone else mentioned this. When it comes to the issue of not being comfortable, wait until he's at least old enough to verbalize or contact us or someone else that there is an issue or something of the like.", "We both work seperate shifts. I work overnight and she works shortly after I get home from work.\n\nWhile my mother does watch him on rare occasions for us to have some relaxation it's always for maybe an hour, at most three hours. At the same time though unlike the issue of this topic of it being for multiple days at a time at a distance of over an hour of driving, 85 miles away, at most we are only gone for a short bit because he's our responsibility and we always stay close and in the area, nothing over 30 minutes away really.", "She can. I suggested it and so did my mother. Problem is her car not being reliable so that's not completely doable. We could possibly pick her up, but at this point I believe it's more of she wants alone time with him than anything for whatever reason", "Good for you? I don't care?", "It\u2019s a bad thing if someone is guilting you into it. If you WANT it and the person caretaking is safe, there is nothing wrong with it. But it is NOT something the OP should be guilted into; it\u2019s not normal or expected or something they *should* do.", "OP, in light of the info you shared about MIL's history and recent reconnecting with your GF, I understand better why you don't trust your MIL as a caregiver yet. So, NTA.\n\nOne thing I will say, gently, as the mother of two teens: it is perfectly okay to have a \\*trusted\\* caregiver care for your infant, even at 3mo, overnight or even several nights. Our pediatrician recommended and encouraged it, because couples need caregiving breaks to tend to their own health and that of their marriage, which is just as important to the child's health as anything else. My husband and I did this regularly, even when our kids were infants, and our sons are now healthy, happy teens.", "The state didn't trust her with her own children tho. I'd be leery of her having baby alone.", "You cared enough to reply to my comment, love.", "Yes, agreed, that's totally fair. Thanks.\n\n(And since OP clarified the specific circumstances about MIL's history, and how she's reacting to his pushback, I think he has good reason not to allow his MIL to do this.)"]}
