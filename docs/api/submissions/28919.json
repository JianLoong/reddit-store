She\u2019s a ginger if that\u2019s any indication and she was invited to a swimming party by her classmate. I asked her if she put on sunscreen and she said she did but I had a feeling she was lying so I asked her more questions about it which just led to more lying (\u201cI put it on upstairs earlier\u201d \u201cI put it on in the car\u201d etc) which really upset me because she has a history of lying. I\u2019ve talked to her several times throughout maybe the past 3 years about how I don\u2019t want care if she does something bad, she should just not lie. Just last week she lied about something related to school and I talked to her again about not lying. This time when she lied, I decided to actually \u201cpunish\u201d her by not letting her go to the party. I feel really bad but at the same time, I feel like she doesn\u2019t take me seriously because I never really punish her. But also she thinks it\u2019s better to lie so she doesn\u2019t get punished. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m that harsh because the worst I\u2019ve ever done was take her phone away for a day. I think I\u2019m the AH because I feel like it\u2019s such a small lie but at the same time, I feel like lying about small things will eventually turn into lying about big things. So AITA for not letting my daughter go to the swim party for lying about wearing sunscreen?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve realized my wrongs but feel free to keep commenting and roast me\n\nSecond edit: came back to this post from like 100 comments to almost 1K comments. There\u2019s a lot of stuff to people are commenting so I\u2019ll just address a few of the couple of comments/questions I\u2019m seeing.\n\n\n1. I already answered this in an earlier comment but I thought she might have been lying because we\u2019ve only been using Korean face sunscreen that I\u2019ve bought in bulk lately since that\u2019s the kind we like to put on ourselves. It comes in a small tube and when I noticed it wasnt really touched, that\u2019s when I started questioning her and that\u2019s when the lies compounded. She said she put on the sunscreen upstairs but it was downstairs the whole time. Then another lie. She eventually admitted to lying. \n\n\n2. How can she put sunscreen on her own? She\u2019s 10, almost 11, and limber? We both have no issues putting on our sunscreen, even the back. \n\n\n3. People saying to let her burn as punishment, I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think you understand how much more likely someone with her skin type will get cancer from being the sun. \n\n\n4. Some people are saying that lying is natural for this age while others are accusing me of abusing her and other things and that\u2019s why she lies. For the latter, I don\u2019t know how you got to that conclusion. \n\n\n\nI think that was it for the most common comment/questions. Overall my takeaway from this is what I got from the comments, be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to situations like this. I appreciate those who offered advice because they genuinely understood that being a parent is hard and no one gets it 100% right. Anybody else who\u2019s reading this and are in a similar situation, I hope this thread gives you insight on how to approach your child(ren).", "created_utc": 1697316542, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177ypxc/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_go_to_a_birthday/", "score": 1801, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you knew she hadn't actually put up on sunscreen, my thought is that she doesn't really want to or see the importance of it. Has she ever had the pain of a sunburn? Does she know about skin cancer? Maybe yes to the first, maybe no to the second. I would have thought of just going with her to the bathroom and watching her put on the sunscreen, help her get it on her back, and start in with talking about WHY it's important.\n\nThis said as a pale person in a family that has a history of skin cancer. I really don't remember how enthusiastic I was about sunblock, but I \\*do\\* know that when I came home from my first band camp (at 14) bright red as a lobster (despite having put on 35 spf that morning)((ahem, South Florida)), my mom ran out and got this gigantic bottle of 90 SPF sunblock and would proceed to make sure I was absolutely covered, and then drilled it into me that I was supposed to put more on at lunchtime AND made sure the adults/parents helping out knew to make sure I put more on. And I did, because damn that sunburn was painful.\n\nSo if it's important, make sure it happens. I don't know that 10 is old enough to really know why some things are as important as they are, so very *very* gentle YTA with the caveat of your know your kid better than I do. And, yeah, if the lying is a thing, maybe talk to a therapist.", "You asked for more comments, so here you go:\n- Did you suspect she hadn\u2019t put on sunscreen when you asked?  Avoid asking questions that you already know the answer to.  Why create an opportunity for your kids to lie?\n- consequences should be predictable. When my kids look back on the job I did as a parent, I hope they will say I was consistent and reasonable.", "Family of gingers here.\n\nAt 10, I doubt she has the ability to properly apply sunscreen especially to her back, ears etc.\n\nIt is your job as her parent to facilitate apply sunscreen, not try to catch her in a lie.\n\nIf she went to the party without sunscreen, nor a sun protection suit in, she will face the consequences of a possibly severe sun burn.  It will hurt.  \n\nLet her face natural consequences and perhaps get some more freckles.\n\nAlso small tubes of sunscreen are not easy for children to use.  The spray sunscreen or the colour changing ones are more likely to be embraced by her.\n\nBuy the poor child a sun suit.", "If she's lying constantly about minor things to get out of punishment, maybe you're punishing her too much for minor things. I don't believe you that the only thing you've ever done is take her cell away fora day. Going from taking away her cell to banning her from a party you were literally in the process of taking her to is a hell of a jump. If you didn't believe her about the sun screen, just tell her to put it on *now*, while you watch.\n\n> I don\u2019t want care if she does something bad, she should just not lie.\n\nMaybe you shouldn't lie to her *while* you're telling her not to lie.", "\u201cHey, I get the feeling you aren\u2019t being honest with me because you are afraid you\u2019re going to get in trouble.

YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou get that you are reason she is lying, right?\n\nShe's afraid of consequences because they are spontaneous (& possibly irritated or angry?) response on your part & not predictable as consequences.\n\nPunishment is not generally an effective deterrent for kids' behaviour, but if you are going to use punishment, she needs to know in advance what the likely outcome is. \n\nA much more effective way of dealing with this sort of thing is asking why she felt the need to lie and talking through that.", "YTA\n\nThere are better ways to solve this problem, also how did you actually know, for sure, that she hadn't put any on? More info needed about that.", "She... she's 10. You're expecting her to act 100% responsibly, never lie about anything, etc? You can't even expect that from other adults or yourself \ud83e\udd23\n\nKids lie to avoid punishment. When kids lie *all the time* it's because they're being punished *all the time.*\n\nEdit: YTA. Forgot to judge", "Every kid has a history of lying. It is developmentally normal. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be unlearned or that you as a parent shouldn\u2019t apply age-appropriate consequences. But this punishment was too big for her to see your logic. YTA on this. Better luck next time.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from- but if she didn\u2019t put on sun screen , and lied about it, I think the lie would have been pretty obvious when she came home.  A painful sunburn. That\u2019s just consequences and probably would have been painful enough.  I don\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019s afraid of you, but the lying indicates that she is afraid of your disappointment.  Children internalize their parents\u2019 opinion (or child\u2019s perception of their parents\u2019 opinion), so honestly I would be setting up therapy and or family therapy.", "This is the hill you chose to die on?", "YTA. So, what happened to the idea of just having her put on sunscreen (more, if you weren't sure she was lying)? Why make her stay home? Sounds like she's feeling self-conscious for some reason, and it might be better to explore that than seek punishment.", "Honestly I was the same way and it took me severely burning to never forget sunscreen again. I went to the beach at 15 with friends and her parents kept reminding us to apply and reapply sunscreen all day. We both ended up bright red and when I showered, I had water bubbles on my back from the peeling skin. We also slept on a leather couch so we stuck to that as well. Never again did I want to go through that again. Sometimes it just takes finding out the hard way for change.", "Ah this is gonna just add to the therapy later she lied bc she\u2019s scared of you or has scensory issues either one it\u2019s your job to fix", "ESH it sounds like she\u2019s lying to lie and talking hasn\u2019t worked. She\u2019s a liar and that needs to be addressed, but\u2026 Sounds like you failed to have consequences or even change your approach to your daughter. If you asked \u201cwhen are you going to put on sunscreen?\u201d What would she have said? Is there something in your tone where she feels obligated to answer yes or no to avoid your response? Step back and think about the driver. Address it. Then consequences. \n\nBut she committed to the party, the people bought food and favors assuming she\u2019d be there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right punishment. No tv/phone/computer would have been a fine first step so would writing about why sunscreen is important.", "ESH. At 10, she should know better than to lie. However, if she were my child I'd let her go to the party anyway and get a sunburn. Live and learn, as they say.\n\nMy mom stopped reminding us kids to put on sunscreen, wear a jacket, etc, when we were about your daughter's age. If we complained afterward, she said, \"I put my jacket on. Your jacket is your responsibility, not mine.\" We only forgot our jackets or sunscreen once.\n\nAs for her continuous lying, you've been letting it go for years now, and she knows that you won't do anything at all or that any punishment won't be very severe. The time to nip it in the bud is way past, but you can try to impress upon her the importance of honesty by resolving to punish her more consistently and with increasingly unpleasant punishments going forward. She needs to learn that you will do what you say you're going to do, and you need to learn to be prepared to make good on your punishments.", "YTA. Instead of grilling her and having to punish her, just watch her put it on in front of you and tell her you will leave for the party when she\u2019s done. Be proactive instead of reactive.", "YTA this is outrageous. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be plenty of more things she does and that she lies about but holding her back from social events or situations because she lied about putting on sunscreen is insane. Strict parents raise sneaky kids.", "You are not being a consistent parent. You said she lies all the time but that you hardly ever give her consequences for it. So why would she stop? If the lying is benefitting her and there are no consequences to getting caught, what would be her motivation to stop lying? I hate punishing my kids. I hate it so much when they cry. It makes me feel so guilty. But, ultimately, parents need to focus on what's best for their children, not what's easiest. You have an obligation to teach your daughter how to be a functioning adult someday. You are not doing her any favors by ignoring the problem. ESH", "Maybe you overreacted. \n\nClearly she lied about putting the sunscreen on because she doesn\u2019t want to; my boyfriend and our adult kids don\u2019t like it either. \n\nI don\u2019t think she was lying to be a menace to society or anything. \n\nWould you tell her she couldn\u2019t go to school if she lied about not brushing her teeth. \n\nI feel that most kids her age lie about certain, seemingly harmless, things. Give her a break.", "YTA. You could have had her put more sun cream on in front of you. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to put a bit more on, just come and do it before you go out\u201d. Instead you get into this whole thing about what a liar she is. \n\nIf you were that concerned about sun burn and skin cancer you\u2019d help her put it on and not trust a 10 year old to do it properly. Reacting like this is going to make her start lying about the big things. Why wouldn\u2019t she lie when she can\u2019t trust you not to overreact", "Yta. Punishment needs to fit the crime.", "YTA\n\nIf you don't relax about your ten year old making mistakes you're going to raise an emotionally stunted adult.", "YTA in this example. Why not say that because of her past history of lying, you don't want to take the chance that she might get sunburned, so she needs to put the sunscreen on right now while you watch, before you'll take her to the party. Then on the way you can talk with her about why she felt the need to lie about it, and how important it is for her to be careful about sun exposure. \n\nIt's not about \"punishments\" which don't do much to deter behavior anyway--it's about trying to rebuild your relationship with her so she doesn't feel a need to lie.", "She\u2019s 10. That\u2019s too young to be in charge of sunscreen herself.  Esh", "INFO: How are you so sure she's lying? I had a mother that would keep asking like this to see if I was lying. I wasn't, but she wouldn't believe until I lied  about lying so she could have to answer she wanted.  Like what is your proof and evidence that she was lying?", "ESH - I looked after kids that age, and the fight about sunscreen was a daily occurrence. Their parents told me they are not allowed at the pool without sunscreen. So until I helped them with sunscreen on their backs, we didn't go to the pool. \n\n\nBut actions have consequences. If your daughter burns, she burns and she learns the lesson. Is it fun? No. Will you be blamed? Probably. But at 10, they are pushing boundaries more and more. Learn which hill to die on.", "If your daughter lies to you it's because she doesn't trust you.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think socials should be witheld as a form of punishment or consequences. That can be pretty damaging for a tween.", "Dude, none of these people are parents. Teaching your kid to be honest is a big part of parenting. NTA BUT may I suggest a better way?\n\nFirst of all, is there any chance your daughter has ADHD? Telling little lies like this is REALLY common with ADHD. It\u2019s an impulsivity issue. The thought pops into their head, \u201cI could lie\u201d and the lie is out of their mouth that fast. They struggle with filtering thoughts. If it\u2019s ADHD, treating that can help. \n\nWhether or not it\u2019s ADHD, I\u2019ve found a lot of success using the following method with my kids, including my ADHD one. When I suspect they\u2019re lying, I say, \u201cIn a minute, I\u2019m going to ask you that question again. I want you to think through your answer before I do. I want you to remember before I ask again that you will ALWAYS get in more trouble me for lying to me than it you just tell the truth. I want you to remember that I can\u2019t trust you when you tell me lies, and you find that really frustrating when you are telling the truth and I doubt you. (I also talk through any other consequences applicable to the situation like a sunburn here). I\u2019m giving you another chance before there will be any consequences: I know sometimes it\u2019s hard for you to think through your answer on the spot. Now, did you put on sunscreen?\u201d\n\nAnd then I hold to what I said. If they lie again, they get in trouble. If they don\u2019t, I thank them for telling me the truth and I either give no consequence or a very very light one. (No sunscreen would be no consequence. Hitting your sibling still gets a consequence, just milder.) My kids pretty consistently tell the truth after that. Sometimes the lie just comes out, and then they feel backed into a corner and like they have to continue it. By putting a pause on and giving them some time to think, plus helping them think through the impact of their words, they generally tell the truth. They just need someone to help them do that brain filtering that happens a lot easier as a mature adult.", "So my brother is a ginger. He used to lie to mom about sunscreen, too. Until he got sunburned so bad his whole back blistered. Never lied again. Which is to say, sometimes they have to make the mistake themselves to learn the lesson.", "YTA, yes sunscreen is important But this is such an overreaction :/", "Lying is problematic.  It's usually done by children because they fear getting into trouble, and it's difficult to break.  Trust is important.\n\nMy youngest was a liar when he was very young.  To break this, I taught my children that if they told me the truth they wouldn't get into trouble but they would if they lied and got caught.  In order for that to work, though, you have to stick to it... and not even get visibly mad.  Now, I did go a touch too far as I found out when he made a comment that I didn't care about him doing bad stuff as long as he told me, so I had to clarify that I absolutely cared, but that telling the truth was more important - and that the truth was the only reason he hadn't been punished... and then had to make a point of addressing my opinions of his behavior in the future and what the consequences could have been/why the behavior was dangerous (although still not mad or lecturing).\n\nWhen the communication doors open I spent a lot of time talking to him about consequences of the things going on around him.  Going to the store with a friend who stole could get him into trouble as well since the store might see him as an accessory, etc.  This only works if you don't take the easy route of lying to kids to scare them into compliance.  If you do that, when they get older and find out you lied it will lead to a lack of trust in the rest of what you say.\n\nHe went from a kid who lied constantly to a kid who told me pretty much everything (even if some of it waited until long enough had passed that he was sure I wouldn't be mad - I think that was him testing that I really wouldn't get mad) and a young adult who shocked his friendss with the stuff he told me.", "Yes. Pick your battles.", "A rule in our house is \u201ctelling the truth lessens the punishment by 90%\u201d", "YTA, you should still be putting sunscreen on her at this age, but this punishment will only make her a better liar.\n\nI\u2019m not particularly pale, but I had the issue of never putting on sunscreen too, or not reapplying enough. My parents tried to tell me, I wouldn\u2019t listen, so they let me suffer the consequences myself. I got huge blisters on both of my shoulders, hurt like crap and I passed out every time they treated them. 100% never made the mistake of not putting on sunscreen again. You could take this route for the times you really can\u2019t apply it for her or be there to make sure she does\n\nGetting blisters once shouldn\u2019t put her at risk of skin cancer (though a possibility as always), but if she continues not to use it after a bad sunburn or blisters, I\u2019d just start putting it on yourself. Maybe at 14 when you\u2019re still sunscreen on her she\u2019ll get embarrassed enough and finally start doing it on her own.\n\nThe best way to punish kids is give related consequences. Marker on the wall? They repaint it/clean it. On inappropriate websites? No electronics. Not using sunscreen? Do it yourself or let them experience the pain. I mean, not letting her go to the party is somewhat related, but a little too extreme and doesn\u2019t fully correlate.", "I had this experience when I was young and you are hurting your daughter in not allowing her to go to a friends party. Kids are mean and now they may use that to tease her. Inclusion is everything at that age.", "I'm going to say from personal experience, punishing someone for lying without finding the root cause for the behavior will just turn a kid into a better liar. \nThe ultimate goal is she needed to wear sunscreen. I've been working in childcare off and on since I was 18 and the technique is \"I'm not letting you leave this designated until I watch you put sunscreen on your body or I do it for you.\" Not delegating it to the child.", "I think there are some deeper issues here with the family dynamics.", "YTA. OVER SUNSCREEN??? Wtf. If she gets scorched, lesson learned for next time.", "*\u201dDude, none of these people are parents.\u201d*\n\nYou\u2019re cute when you just make things up.", "YTA. You need to keep the lines of communication open, not punish her for lying.  If you know she didnt put it on, just say something like \" come on, hon.  We all hate putting on sunscreen, but otherwise ypu'll burn. Lets put it on, then we'll go.\"", "So, the \u201chistory of lying\u201d thing is kind of silly. Kids always lie about silly shit. When it becomes a pattern of fear, you should be taking her to a therapist, not punishing her. That\u2019s going to make it worse.", "YTA. She\u2019s only 10. She probably feels different to all her friends as it is. You could have had a useful conversation about the importance on sunblock rather than being punitive. If she\u2019s scared of being punished, she\u2019ll probably keep lying.", "Lying usually comes from insecurity and fear of not being the perfect human. (At least for me)\n\nI would definitely have a heart to heart to get to the bottom of the lying pit.\nI got hit a lot when I was a kid, and lying was the only way to make my mom believe me. I usually got the 20 questions, and if I wasn't perfect, I'd get hit...\nMy parents and I don't have a good relationship now, and we never will.\n\nListening is a wonderful tool to create that loving bond and I hope things can work out differently.", "She has a history of lying bc you demand certain types of answers from her which don\u2019t resonate with her own inner truth. So she will tell you anything now hoping it\u2019ll suffice and you\u2019ll get off her back. Let her get a sunburn for her to learn. Don\u2019t prepave her road for her; that\u2019s called steamroll-style parenting. Let her pave her own way.", "YTA. Your daughter is afraid of you and she would rather lie and take the risk of being caught, rather then tell the truth and be punished. I don't know what kind of behaviour you engage in when you're angry but it's definitely sending a message to your daughter that you are not a safe person", "YTA", "to be fair, i think you've made every wrong move here\n\nyou should incentivize honesty -- you claim to seeks only facts, but she's afraid of you\n\nshe's clearly convinced you will be upset if she tells you the truth!", "A 10 year old doesn\u2019t want to put on sunscreen???? Shocker\n\nLet her get burned a few times and she\u2019ll realise it\u2019s importance. \n\nYTA", "I feel like getting sunburned would be the more lasting/fitting punishment.\n\nLet her reap the consequences of her actions.", "I don\u2019t blame her for lying\u2014you sound like you get really worked up about what she does and doesn\u2019t do, for example, interrogating her over sunblock use and grounding her. \n\nI understand the dangers of skin cancer (I\u2019m very pale and have predisposition for melanoma), but your response is excessive and is likely just going to cause more issues down the line. More lying, strained relationship, etc.\n\nNo matter how vigilant/obsessive you are, she\u2019s going to end up getting sunburnt at some point, or multiple points in her life. It\u2019s better to educate (without fear), remind her, how to heal a sunburn, and find a brand that she likes.\n\nAre you using a high quality, non-greasy and non-smelling sun block? I hate the sensation of greasy lotion and won\u2019t use it, so I wouldn\u2019t expect a child to use it either. Same thing if it smells awful. Also, if it\u2019s the wrong brand, or low quality, it could be ineffective regardless. \n\nAgain, this is the wrong hill to die on. You\u2019re just showing your daughter that you\u2019re controlling and she can\u2019t trust you not to flip out over the smallest things.", "It was a small fib and at the end of the day she\u2019s a child and YOU should be helping her apply sunscreen. I\u2019m an adult and still need some one to put it on my back for me. Kids tell fibs it\u2019s just how it is.", "A 10 yo liar usually has found its her best defense. She's not heard. Her opinion and ideas don't matter. A soldier without a voice, pretends to be compliant.  YTA", "YTA. She is 10, thats still very young. Im working with children and teenagers who live in a group home. Many of them lie because they are afraid of punishment (in their case they were often beaten or punished by other very not ok things). The problem is that the child most likely wont really understand that she is being punished for lying and not for what she did, so she will lie again next time, because she is afraid of being punished. \n\nWhat I do with children who have to unlearn that behavior, I will practice with them to tell the truth. So for example a conversation would go something like this: \"so, you are contradicting yourself right now. Did you maybe not want to put on lotion? You can just tell me and I promise I wont be mad. Just say: Sorry, I didnt put on the lotion\" then let them repeat that and tell them good job for telling the truth! (Obviously you need to be sure they really didnt put on the sunscreen). Then I would also try to find out why they didnt put it on. Maybe they dont like the feeling, the smell.. Maybe something else was more interesting.. So then I would calmly explain that while I understand them, that it is important to me, because I want them to be protected and depending on their reason, I will try and find a solution. Also when I have the time at a good moment, I will talk to them about trust and why it is important that they dont lie (giving examples where you wouldnt believe them when they tell the truth or where lying could be harmful to them or others).\n\nIn the long run it also helps to think about the punishments given. If children feel safe and know they will only get consequences that are logical and also they wont be left alone (emotionally), they wont be as afraid of doing something wrong, so they wont lie. Otherwise they will just get better at lying eventually.", "NTA\n\nThis is what you should have done from the beginning. Just be sure to follow up by telling her that if she had told the truth, you would have let her go get the sunscreen and put it on and still go to the party. And even the second time, when you gave her a chance to come clean, she still would have been able to go to the party. It was the consistent lie after lie after lie that got her in trouble and cost her the privilege of going to the party. In this way she will learn that telling the truth, even after being caught, is better than compounding the lie.", "YTA for the fact that you\u2019ve talked to her about this for 3 years and should have given her consequences sooner when that wasn\u2019t working. You jumped from taking her phone away for one day to withholding a party. I would look into some therapy; it can help you with setting boundaries for her and also to find out what is causing the lying and whether it can be easily fixed. Good luck.", "NTA like you said her lying is obviously an issue and if she's not afraid to lie about small stuff now. How much worse could it get later on.

She\u2019s a ginger if that\u2019s any indication and she was invited to a swimming party by her classmate. I asked her if she put on sunscreen and she said she did but I had a feeling she was lying so I asked her more questions about it which just led to more lying (\u201cI put it on upstairs earlier\u201d \u201cI put it on in the car\u201d etc) which really upset me because she has a history of lying. I\u2019ve talked to her several times throughout maybe the past 3 years about how I don\u2019t want care if she does something bad, she should just not lie. Just last week she lied about something related to school and I talked to her again about not lying. This time when she lied, I decided to actually \u201cpunish\u201d her by not letting her go to the party. I feel really bad but at the same time, I feel like she doesn\u2019t take me seriously because I never really punish her. But also she thinks it\u2019s better to lie so she doesn\u2019t get punished. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m that harsh because the worst I\u2019ve ever done was take her phone away for a day. I think I\u2019m the AH because I feel like it\u2019s such a small lie but at the same time, I feel like lying about small things will eventually turn into lying about big things. So AITA for not letting my daughter go to the swim party for lying about wearing sunscreen?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A lot of things make sense now looking back. Mandate daily hygienes were really hard for me. From brushing my teeth to putting deodorant, if it's boring, it feels like climbing a mountain to do it. Hence a lot of lying to get away with it. I didn't grasp the consequences of lying until 16 or so, and by then damage was already done. Mom can't trust me, but I get angry at her for not trusting me. I know it's really unfair.\n\nWhat I suggest is body doubling. If you need her to do certain task, do the same thing in front of her while she does it. We learn better by watching rather than audio input. And don't punish lying, that will make her better lier next time. If you need to get information out of her, instead of asking \"why?\" ask \"what happened?\" Then she can explain the train of thoughts that lead her there. \n\nGood luck!", "A slight AH. I get having a huge issue with lying because I personally can't stand lying. I always told my kids I might not like what they say or do but it will be much worse for them if they lie about it.

She may have her own thing going on that is actually a root cause here that you could help her address instead of punishing her for lying when that's just the coping strategy she's worked out yeah?

So is she lying because she has an issue with sunscreen and thinks you won\u2019t listen? Or just lying to lie which as you said can become a big problem. I would start taking every lie super serious and have a long drawn out conversation about each and every lie as soon as they occur. And about the issue she lied about. As well as a consequence.

Obvious no. They then had to deal with me watching them brush & perfecting their brushing skills until they said (to where I believed I had exasperated them sufficiently) they would do it correctly.

Simple.", "Here's a parenting tip: Give the kid the power to make or break their decisions. A punishment out of nowhere doesn't really achieve anything, especially here where the bigger picture issue is you'd like her to stop lying to you. Here's a sample conversation:\n\n\"Did you put on sunscreen?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"Are you sure? Because if you're lying and I find out, there will be consequences\"\n\n\"But I did!\"\n\n\"OK... last chance to come clean.

And take a minute to think about your response\"\n\nThis works very well because the consequences are entirely in the kid's control, and if they make the wrong decision, you can point that out later and it gives them something to think about.

Because they are afraid of someone\u2019s reaction. Because they feel (wrongly or not) that they cannot be honest without incurring anger or some other unpleasant situation. So if we want to value honestly above all else at all cost, we need to create a place where kids can be honest and know they won\u2019t be punished or scolded but instead helped. Where if they have to admit they didn\u2019t do something (because they hate it) instead of being scolded they\u2019ll hear commiseration and an offer to help (if the kid thinks something sucks, chances are good you do too or at least understand how / why they feel that way!).

I think what it ultimately needs is genuine understanding and communication, though. \n\nmost of the time, I lied because 1) I felt it made me interesting to my parents, who were often very uninterested in me as a person, which made me more likely to make stuff up, and 2) I lied to avoid being shouted at and punished for things because I grew up in a very strict household where nothing was allowed to be *explained* \\- anything regarded as bad was always a symptom of me being a 'bad kid' (despite the fact I did great in school, was polite and pleasant, etc). obviously, these two things were much deeper-rooted issues, but I feel as though there's nearly always a reason for children to lie as long as those lies aren't huge.\n\nfor instance, I never lied about anything important, and I did grow out of it socially. I reached a point in my early teens where I realised there was no point in it anymore. I also remember peers in school who would lie about huge things - I remember someone who used to lie about her mother having cancer and other really serious issues and I always found it really shocking. I knew that that was wrong and I think that also worked as a deterrent for me. that being said, I also think there's a big difference between a kid like me - using smaller lies to avoid punishment or to sound 'better' - and kids who really seem to have an issue with constant huge lies, which OP's child doesn't seem to do. \n\nhowever, being constantly called a liar by my parents did absolutely nothing to stop me from lying to them or lying in general. it was honestly just social shame when/if I got caught out that made me stop. like, once I lied about getting a 'special' version of a CD of my favourite band with a special bonus song, and my friend called me out by saying it was a digital only song, lol. that was better motivation to stop lying than my parents ever were!\n\nultimately, I can't really say what I wish I'd had from my parents because it was such a multi-layered issue (I come from a home with lots of abuse and neglect, so it's really hard for me to be able to comment on a relatively normal family dynamic). I will say again that I do think communication is necessary. it seems to me that people often forget they can sit their kids down and actually talk to them about things, and that not doing this often leads to a total breakdown of communication and trust. what I would have liked was a sit-down chat where my parents tried to understand what my motivations for lying were, and where I could have genuinely explained myself to them.", "As someone who went through kind of a similar childhood: my mom never apologized or made up for accusing me of lying after it was proven I didn't, UNTIL one day my stepfather said, when I was about 9, \"I'm really glad you pushed back and stood your ground when we thought you did x thing but you didn't. You stood up for yourself when you knew you were right and that's great, I'm proud of you.\"\n\nI'm guessing my mom heard that and realized the damage she was doing -- she still wasn't very GOOD about walking it back if she found out I hadn't been lying, but she did it sometimes. In some ways I think this was even more frustrating for me as a kid because it was inconsistent and unpredictable, but I do think it improved my outcomes vis-a-vis compulsive lying as an adult.

He loves flowers and decides to hold a contest.  He gives all the children in the land some special seeds and the child who grows the best flowers will replace him as emperor upon his death.

When the day comes to present their results before the emperor, the young boy arrives with an empty pot and tells the emperor he did his best.

The US is 1 in 5) and excellent awareness and prevention campaigns. American and other non Australian dermatologists are familiar with our programs and recommend them highly. As a former primary (elementary) school teacher, there are lots of free resources for children easily available on the internet. Try the Cancer Council of Australia as well. \n\nFind out why she doesn\u2019t like applying sunscreen. Does she have issues with the texture or smell, is it too hard to apply, or does she run out of time? Maybe she needs help to apply it, or another form like a roll on, spray or stick. Just be aware that the sprays and roll ons still need to be rubbed in to provide proper coverage, and you need more than you think you do. Most people don\u2019t apply enough sunscreen to get the full UV rating on the bottle. \n\nMaybe she needs a \u2018chemical\u2019 sunscreen, or a \u2018physical\u2019, zinc based formulation if she has sensitive skin. I hate those terms (everything on the planet is a chemical, including pure water and the air you breathe (it\u2019s primarily nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide) but they are commonly used. There is also a lot of misinformation about \u2018chemical\u2019 sunscreens, they are perfectly safe and no scientists are worried about them damaging coral reefs). Maybe a Korean or Japanese brand would feel better on her skin, and they\u2019re much easier to find these days, usually online though. Australia also makes excellent sunscreens, but I don\u2019t know how accessible they are overseas. \n\nIf you\u2019re going outside with her, you also need sunscreen. You need to set an example, and get her to come and put the sunscreen on with you while you\u2019re applying yours. This way you are seeing her do it and don\u2019t have to work out if she\u2019s telling the truth or not. It\u2019s important to model good sun protection habits to your child, as well as practice them yourself. Make sure you do it with enough time before you leave so you\u2019re not rushing. You still get a lot of UV exposure in a car, so even if you\u2019re just driving her to and from activities, it\u2019s still good to wear sunscreen. You still get vitamin D while wearing sunscreen, it just takes a little longer. And it\u2019s doesn\u2019t take that much exposure either, just your hands and face. In Australia, 15 minutes with your hands and face exposed while wearing 50+ sunscreen is enough. You only need 5 without the sunscreen. This will vary based on your local UV levels, but 30 minutes to your hands and face with sunscreen should be enough. \n\nAlso encourage her to wear a hat in the sun, and to stay in the shade when she can. In Australia we use multiple measures at the same time (all 5 steps of Slip slop slap etc) so that there is extra protection in case one step fails. Like you have a hat if you forget your sunscreen, or if it was left in the car and has gone off. Don\u2019t let your sunscreen get too hot, that can render it ineffective. Also check the expiration dates, because it goes off and is less effective as well. \n\nI may sound like I\u2019m nuts about sunscreen, but it\u2019s a huge issue in Australia. As I said, we have the highest skin cancer rates in the world (I believe our neighbours in New Zealand are second) and our UV levels are amongst the highest on the planet. Honestly, fair skinned people have no business living in this climate (I saw as a fair skinned person living here with no plans to move. I\u2019ve lived here my entire life).

That's like saying it's okay to let your child not wear a seatbelt if you're not driving very fast because the natural consequences of a fender bender are only a minor concussion from slamming into the dashboard \ud83d\ude06\n\nEDIT: u/eudoriaspeaks OP please don't take this tack!", "Just not the intended lesson.", "OP u/eudoriaspeaks, Your daughter is 10, so maybe read the 4-5 posts directly above my response to your child so she is aware of what she may need to deal with in the future. You are not trying to be bossy, but you are asking her to wear it to protect her. Compare it to money for buying her favorite thing. Instead of being able to buy XYZ which is her favorite, she may need to spend 50x that money being treated by not being diligent enough, especially if she is in the USA. \n\nWearing sunscreen now saves money for her future self.", "Are u sure? I mean parasol is great but no way kids are holding that for all day especially in theme park where they usually prefers run around or taking photos with mascots.", "Don't know if you know, but I just discovered they make parasols that block UVA/UVB. I'm thrilled! Totally buying one before next summer.", "Cool! I'll check them out too! Please people take care of your skin! Even if you are a poc, please get your skin checked. Skin cancer happens to all of us!", "LLBean has a lot of SPF clothing too--I have naturally pink skin and can get crispy in the sun!", "People need to get in the habit of checking the UV index.", "Yes! This is what my parents did and have taught me about interacting with kids. Don't give them the opportunity to lie and be careful of accusations or insinuating they are a \"bad kid.\" As you said, explain why you told them no. Or for mistakes/messes acknowledge the problem and come up with a solution together.", "That is excellent advice haha thank you, I've evolved to doing this (most of the time) when I know the answer to the question.. but sometimes it'll be him talking about things that happened at school or talking about a friend and I can just tell it's a bull-crap story that I can't verify. However, from these responses I'm starting to see the pattern a bit better which is nice. I.e. is he lying because it's a task he doesn't want to do or something he thinks he'll get in trouble over? (That's the reason for the lie). Or is it a lie to make himself seem more interesting? (That would be embellished stories from school), and how they aren't serious, hurtful lies that he tells.. so that hopefully he will grow out of telling them and be discouraged by his peers when they call him out. Like OP (for my question) said, they recognized the more serious lies of other kids and knew it was wrong.. and my son does too! He gets upset when his friends at school tell tall tales or lie about bad behaviour (so that gives me hope!!). (And it's so ironic he feels that way eh lol) I think my biggest takeaway from everyone's responses is how I can change the way I see the lies, how I let myself feel/react to them, and what steps I take when talking to him about them. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e", "> She does it to get what she wants\n\nYes. That would be the reason.", "It's not aggressive. It's exasperated.\n\nAnd me. The someone the comment responded to was me.", "Except that one with the frying pan and the egg. I vaguely recall it, like \u201cthis is your brain on meth\u201d or something like that and she slams the frying pan on the egg.", "Nah, I kinda want to as well. I\u2019m curious what old peeps on the internet are up to lol", "Maaan im from eastern europe originally. I have no fkg idea when sunnscreems were created in the world. I know when they appeared on the market in my country. In 90s , only barely anyone were using them then. Knowing when some shit was created in the world when you grow up in the country without world wide web was not a priority for many kids. And then once you are already grown up,  knowing bunch of original information is not important", "Sunscreen was around when I was growing up... but the far bigger selling item was tanning oil because tanning was considered good and healthy when I was a kid.  I still remember the \"flash 'em a coppertone tan\" jingle.  I'm not pre-sunscreen... but I am pre-sunscreen use being normal and desirable and I'm here.", "coincidentally I saw someone today in another thread talking about how they were told something in 1940-something and was thinking \"man we really got some old folks on here after all\"", "Haha! Exactly", "consider the situation? The situation is the discussion on if 1 sunburn will cause cancer.\n\nOh and yes almost every 10 year old I've ever met. Why are the 10 year olds you know getting burnt regularly", "I also use the spray when I don\u2019t have anything else. It\u2019s provided sufficient coverage at the beach but I do have to reapply way more often. I\u2019m pasty white as well. You can see all of my blue veins and I\u2019m only 35. I can literally feel when my skin is starting to burn, too. I hate it, but overcompensating is what helps me most. I don\u2019t *enjoy* using lotion and getting it all over my hands.", "Notice how I said \"and no other reason\"", "The original was \"This is your brain\" egg. \"This is your brain on drugs\" puts into frying pan. \"Any questions?\" I know Johnny Depp did it, but there might have been others, too.\n\nThen in the 90s Rachel Leigh Cook did an \"edgier\" one where she took the egg and smashed it with the pan, then proceeded to destroy the entire kitchen.", "Well, sunblock wasn't really a thing when I was 10.  Me and all my friends/family pretty much burned to varying degrees multiple times each summer.  Not smart, but we didn't know any better.  Next question?", "I think redheads are more susceptible to bad burns so there could be a greater chance of it turning into a blistering sunburn.", "People with fair skin, like OP's daughter are more susceptible to *severe blistering burns.*  That is why we are bringing it up.", "I also just try to stay in the shade so that it\u2019s not as bad if I forget to reapply, but spraying the sunscreen is a whole lot easier mentally than putting sunscreen on my legs that have sand on them *shudder*", "Being frustrated, yes. Letting that frustration push you to lash out with an excessive punishment, no.", "Why do you think there needs to be another reason?", "Oh you definitely made the right decision! I've heard the same thing about WoW from friends but they also warned me what an addicting money pit it can be. While RPGs is one of my favorite genres of gaming I prefer to only play the ones where spending begins and ends at in-game currency.", "It\u2019s true! My ex husband and I had just had a new baby when he was working on WoW. That baby is now in high school. LOL", "    you do realize\n    \n\n# stop!!", "So it could be likely that OP's daughter is a liar just because she wants to get her way/don't wanna do whatever she's supposed to do/etc and not because OP punishes her for every minor things like you suggested?", "Hs! I feel ya!  The problem I had wasn't money but time.  I lost 18 hours playing an old school offline computer game.  That taught me real quick that gaming was a bad idea.  Shame, I loved the Atari 2600, but modern gaming is dangerous for me."]}
