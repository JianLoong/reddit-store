She\u2019s a ginger if that\u2019s any indication and she was invited to a swimming party by her classmate. I asked her if she put on sunscreen and she said she did but I had a feeling she was lying so I asked her more questions about it which just led to more lying (\u201cI put it on upstairs earlier\u201d \u201cI put it on in the car\u201d etc) which really upset me because she has a history of lying. I\u2019ve talked to her several times throughout maybe the past 3 years about how I don\u2019t want care if she does something bad, she should just not lie. Just last week she lied about something related to school and I talked to her again about not lying. This time when she lied, I decided to actually \u201cpunish\u201d her by not letting her go to the party. I feel really bad but at the same time, I feel like she doesn\u2019t take me seriously because I never really punish her. But also she thinks it\u2019s better to lie so she doesn\u2019t get punished. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m that harsh because the worst I\u2019ve ever done was take her phone away for a day. I think I\u2019m the AH because I feel like it\u2019s such a small lie but at the same time, I feel like lying about small things will eventually turn into lying about big things.

If you knew she hadn't actually put up on sunscreen, my thought is that she doesn't really want to or see the importance of it. Has she ever had the pain of a sunburn? Does she know about skin cancer? Maybe yes to the first, maybe no to the second. I would have thought of just going with her to the bathroom and watching her put on the sunscreen, help her get it on her back, and start in with talking about WHY it's important.\n\nThis said as a pale person in a family that has a history of skin cancer. I really don't remember how enthusiastic I was about sunblock, but I \\*do\\* know that when I came home from my first band camp (at 14) bright red as a lobster (despite having put on 35 spf that morning)((ahem, South Florida)), my mom ran out and got this gigantic bottle of 90 SPF sunblock and would proceed to make sure I was absolutely covered, and then drilled it into me that I was supposed to put more on at lunchtime AND made sure the adults/parents helping out knew to make sure I put more on. And I did, because damn that sunburn was painful.\n\nSo if it's important, make sure it happens. I don't know that 10 is old enough to really know why some things are as important as they are, so very *very* gentle YTA with the caveat of your know your kid better than I do. And, yeah, if the lying is a thing, maybe talk to a therapist.", "You asked for more comments, so here you go:\n- Did you suspect she hadn\u2019t put on sunscreen when you asked?  Avoid asking questions that you already know the answer to.  Why create an opportunity for your kids to lie?\n- consequences should be predictable. When my kids look back on the job I did as a parent, I hope they will say I was consistent and reasonable.", "Family of gingers here.\n\nAt 10, I doubt she has the ability to properly apply sunscreen especially to her back, ears etc.\n\nIt is your job as her parent to facilitate apply sunscreen, not try to catch her in a lie.\n\nIf she went to the party without sunscreen, nor a sun protection suit in, she will face the consequences of a possibly severe sun burn.  It will hurt.  \n\nLet her face natural consequences and perhaps get some more freckles.\n\nAlso small tubes of sunscreen are not easy for children to use.  The spray sunscreen or the colour changing ones are more likely to be embraced by her.\n\nBuy the poor child a sun suit.", "If she's lying constantly about minor things to get out of punishment, maybe you're punishing her too much for minor things. I don't believe you that the only thing you've ever done is take her cell away fora day. Going from taking away her cell to banning her from a party you were literally in the process of taking her to is a hell of a jump. If you didn't believe her about the sun screen, just tell her to put it on *now*, while you watch.\n\n> I don\u2019t want care if she does something bad, she should just not lie.\n\nMaybe you shouldn't lie to her *while* you're telling her not to lie.", "\u201cHey, I get the feeling you aren\u2019t being honest with me because you are afraid you\u2019re going to get in trouble.

YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou get that you are reason she is lying, right?\n\nShe's afraid of consequences because they are spontaneous (& possibly irritated or angry?) response on your part & not predictable as consequences.\n\nPunishment is not generally an effective deterrent for kids' behaviour, but if you are going to use punishment, she needs to know in advance what the likely outcome is. \n\nA much more effective way of dealing with this sort of thing is asking why she felt the need to lie and talking through that.", "YTA\n\nThere are better ways to solve this problem, also how did you actually know, for sure, that she hadn't put any on? More info needed about that.", "She... she's 10. You're expecting her to act 100% responsibly, never lie about anything, etc? You can't even expect that from other adults or yourself \ud83e\udd23\n\nKids lie to avoid punishment. When kids lie *all the time* it's because they're being punished *all the time.*\n\nEdit: YTA. Forgot to judge", "Every kid has a history of lying. It is developmentally normal. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be unlearned or that you as a parent shouldn\u2019t apply age-appropriate consequences. But this punishment was too big for her to see your logic. YTA on this. Better luck next time.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from- but if she didn\u2019t put on sun screen , and lied about it, I think the lie would have been pretty obvious when she came home.  A painful sunburn. That\u2019s just consequences and probably would have been painful enough.  I don\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019s afraid of you, but the lying indicates that she is afraid of your disappointment.  Children internalize their parents\u2019 opinion (or child\u2019s perception of their parents\u2019 opinion), so honestly I would be setting up therapy and or family therapy.", "This is the hill you chose to die on?", "YTA. So, what happened to the idea of just having her put on sunscreen (more, if you weren't sure she was lying)? Why make her stay home? Sounds like she's feeling self-conscious for some reason, and it might be better to explore that than seek punishment.", "Honestly I was the same way and it took me severely burning to never forget sunscreen again. I went to the beach at 15 with friends and her parents kept reminding us to apply and reapply sunscreen all day. We both ended up bright red and when I showered, I had water bubbles on my back from the peeling skin. We also slept on a leather couch so we stuck to that as well. Never again did I want to go through that again. Sometimes it just takes finding out the hard way for change.", "Ah this is gonna just add to the therapy later she lied bc she\u2019s scared of you or has scensory issues either one it\u2019s your job to fix", "ESH it sounds like she\u2019s lying to lie and talking hasn\u2019t worked. She\u2019s a liar and that needs to be addressed, but\u2026 Sounds like you failed to have consequences or even change your approach to your daughter. If you asked \u201cwhen are you going to put on sunscreen?\u201d What would she have said? Is there something in your tone where she feels obligated to answer yes or no to avoid your response? Step back and think about the driver. Address it. Then consequences. \n\nBut she committed to the party, the people bought food and favors assuming she\u2019d be there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right punishment. No tv/phone/computer would have been a fine first step so would writing about why sunscreen is important.", "ESH. At 10, she should know better than to lie. However, if she were my child I'd let her go to the party anyway and get a sunburn. Live and learn, as they say.\n\nMy mom stopped reminding us kids to put on sunscreen, wear a jacket, etc, when we were about your daughter's age. If we complained afterward, she said, \"I put my jacket on. Your jacket is your responsibility, not mine.\" We only forgot our jackets or sunscreen once.\n\nAs for her continuous lying, you've been letting it go for years now, and she knows that you won't do anything at all or that any punishment won't be very severe. The time to nip it in the bud is way past, but you can try to impress upon her the importance of honesty by resolving to punish her more consistently and with increasingly unpleasant punishments going forward. She needs to learn that you will do what you say you're going to do, and you need to learn to be prepared to make good on your punishments.", "YTA. Instead of grilling her and having to punish her, just watch her put it on in front of you and tell her you will leave for the party when she\u2019s done. Be proactive instead of reactive.", "YTA this is outrageous. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be plenty of more things she does and that she lies about but holding her back from social events or situations because she lied about putting on sunscreen is insane. Strict parents raise sneaky kids.", "You are not being a consistent parent. You said she lies all the time but that you hardly ever give her consequences for it. So why would she stop? If the lying is benefitting her and there are no consequences to getting caught, what would be her motivation to stop lying? I hate punishing my kids. I hate it so much when they cry. It makes me feel so guilty. But, ultimately, parents need to focus on what's best for their children, not what's easiest. You have an obligation to teach your daughter how to be a functioning adult someday. You are not doing her any favors by ignoring the problem. ESH", "Maybe you overreacted. \n\nClearly she lied about putting the sunscreen on because she doesn\u2019t want to; my boyfriend and our adult kids don\u2019t like it either. \n\nI don\u2019t think she was lying to be a menace to society or anything. \n\nWould you tell her she couldn\u2019t go to school if she lied about not brushing her teeth. \n\nI feel that most kids her age lie about certain, seemingly harmless, things. Give her a break.", "YTA. You could have had her put more sun cream on in front of you. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to put a bit more on, just come and do it before you go out\u201d. Instead you get into this whole thing about what a liar she is. \n\nIf you were that concerned about sun burn and skin cancer you\u2019d help her put it on and not trust a 10 year old to do it properly. Reacting like this is going to make her start lying about the big things. Why wouldn\u2019t she lie when she can\u2019t trust you not to overreact", "Yta. Punishment needs to fit the crime.", "YTA\n\nIf you don't relax about your ten year old making mistakes you're going to raise an emotionally stunted adult.", "YTA in this example. Why not say that because of her past history of lying, you don't want to take the chance that she might get sunburned, so she needs to put the sunscreen on right now while you watch, before you'll take her to the party. Then on the way you can talk with her about why she felt the need to lie about it, and how important it is for her to be careful about sun exposure. \n\nIt's not about \"punishments\" which don't do much to deter behavior anyway--it's about trying to rebuild your relationship with her so she doesn't feel a need to lie.", "She\u2019s 10. That\u2019s too young to be in charge of sunscreen herself.  Esh", "INFO: How are you so sure she's lying? I had a mother that would keep asking like this to see if I was lying. I wasn't, but she wouldn't believe until I lied  about lying so she could have to answer she wanted.  Like what is your proof and evidence that she was lying?", "ESH - I looked after kids that age, and the fight about sunscreen was a daily occurrence. Their parents told me they are not allowed at the pool without sunscreen. So until I helped them with sunscreen on their backs, we didn't go to the pool. \n\n\nBut actions have consequences. If your daughter burns, she burns and she learns the lesson. Is it fun? No. Will you be blamed? Probably. But at 10, they are pushing boundaries more and more. Learn which hill to die on.", "If your daughter lies to you it's because she doesn't trust you.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think socials should be witheld as a form of punishment or consequences. That can be pretty damaging for a tween.", "Dude, none of these people are parents. Teaching your kid to be honest is a big part of parenting. NTA BUT may I suggest a better way?\n\nFirst of all, is there any chance your daughter has ADHD? Telling little lies like this is REALLY common with ADHD. It\u2019s an impulsivity issue. The thought pops into their head, \u201cI could lie\u201d and the lie is out of their mouth that fast. They struggle with filtering thoughts. If it\u2019s ADHD, treating that can help. \n\nWhether or not it\u2019s ADHD, I\u2019ve found a lot of success using the following method with my kids, including my ADHD one. When I suspect they\u2019re lying, I say, \u201cIn a minute, I\u2019m going to ask you that question again. I want you to think through your answer before I do. I want you to remember before I ask again that you will ALWAYS get in more trouble me for lying to me than it you just tell the truth. I want you to remember that I can\u2019t trust you when you tell me lies, and you find that really frustrating when you are telling the truth and I doubt you. (I also talk through any other consequences applicable to the situation like a sunburn here). I\u2019m giving you another chance before there will be any consequences: I know sometimes it\u2019s hard for you to think through your answer on the spot. Now, did you put on sunscreen?\u201d\n\nAnd then I hold to what I said. If they lie again, they get in trouble. If they don\u2019t, I thank them for telling me the truth and I either give no consequence or a very very light one. (No sunscreen would be no consequence. Hitting your sibling still gets a consequence, just milder.) My kids pretty consistently tell the truth after that. Sometimes the lie just comes out, and then they feel backed into a corner and like they have to continue it. By putting a pause on and giving them some time to think, plus helping them think through the impact of their words, they generally tell the truth. They just need someone to help them do that brain filtering that happens a lot easier as a mature adult.", "So my brother is a ginger. He used to lie to mom about sunscreen, too. Until he got sunburned so bad his whole back blistered. Never lied again. Which is to say, sometimes they have to make the mistake themselves to learn the lesson.", "YTA, yes sunscreen is important But this is such an overreaction :/", "Lying is problematic.  It's usually done by children because they fear getting into trouble, and it's difficult to break.  Trust is important.\n\nMy youngest was a liar when he was very young.  To break this, I taught my children that if they told me the truth they wouldn't get into trouble but they would if they lied and got caught.  In order for that to work, though, you have to stick to it... and not even get visibly mad.  Now, I did go a touch too far as I found out when he made a comment that I didn't care about him doing bad stuff as long as he told me, so I had to clarify that I absolutely cared, but that telling the truth was more important - and that the truth was the only reason he hadn't been punished... and then had to make a point of addressing my opinions of his behavior in the future and what the consequences could have been/why the behavior was dangerous (although still not mad or lecturing).\n\nWhen the communication doors open I spent a lot of time talking to him about consequences of the things going on around him.  Going to the store with a friend who stole could get him into trouble as well since the store might see him as an accessory, etc.  This only works if you don't take the easy route of lying to kids to scare them into compliance.  If you do that, when they get older and find out you lied it will lead to a lack of trust in the rest of what you say.\n\nHe went from a kid who lied constantly to a kid who told me pretty much everything (even if some of it waited until long enough had passed that he was sure I wouldn't be mad - I think that was him testing that I really wouldn't get mad) and a young adult who shocked his friendss with the stuff he told me.", "Yes. Pick your battles.", "A rule in our house is \u201ctelling the truth lessens the punishment by 90%\u201d", "YTA, you should still be putting sunscreen on her at this age, but this punishment will only make her a better liar.\n\nI\u2019m not particularly pale, but I had the issue of never putting on sunscreen too, or not reapplying enough. My parents tried to tell me, I wouldn\u2019t listen, so they let me suffer the consequences myself. I got huge blisters on both of my shoulders, hurt like crap and I passed out every time they treated them. 100% never made the mistake of not putting on sunscreen again. You could take this route for the times you really can\u2019t apply it for her or be there to make sure she does\n\nGetting blisters once shouldn\u2019t put her at risk of skin cancer (though a possibility as always), but if she continues not to use it after a bad sunburn or blisters, I\u2019d just start putting it on yourself. Maybe at 14 when you\u2019re still sunscreen on her she\u2019ll get embarrassed enough and finally start doing it on her own.\n\nThe best way to punish kids is give related consequences. Marker on the wall? They repaint it/clean it. On inappropriate websites? No electronics. Not using sunscreen? Do it yourself or let them experience the pain. I mean, not letting her go to the party is somewhat related, but a little too extreme and doesn\u2019t fully correlate.", "I had this experience when I was young and you are hurting your daughter in not allowing her to go to a friends party. Kids are mean and now they may use that to tease her. Inclusion is everything at that age.", "I'm going to say from personal experience, punishing someone for lying without finding the root cause for the behavior will just turn a kid into a better liar. \nThe ultimate goal is she needed to wear sunscreen. I've been working in childcare off and on since I was 18 and the technique is \"I'm not letting you leave this designated until I watch you put sunscreen on your body or I do it for you.\" Not delegating it to the child.", "I think there are some deeper issues here with the family dynamics.", "YTA. OVER SUNSCREEN??? Wtf. If she gets scorched, lesson learned for next time.", "*\u201dDude, none of these people are parents.\u201d*\n\nYou\u2019re cute when you just make things up.", "YTA. You need to keep the lines of communication open, not punish her for lying.  If you know she didnt put it on, just say something like \" come on, hon.  We all hate putting on sunscreen, but otherwise ypu'll burn. Lets put it on, then we'll go.\"", "So, the \u201chistory of lying\u201d thing is kind of silly. Kids always lie about silly shit. When it becomes a pattern of fear, you should be taking her to a therapist, not punishing her. That\u2019s going to make it worse.", "YTA. She\u2019s only 10. She probably feels different to all her friends as it is. You could have had a useful conversation about the importance on sunblock rather than being punitive. If she\u2019s scared of being punished, she\u2019ll probably keep lying.", "Lying usually comes from insecurity and fear of not being the perfect human. (At least for me)\n\nI would definitely have a heart to heart to get to the bottom of the lying pit.\nI got hit a lot when I was a kid, and lying was the only way to make my mom believe me. I usually got the 20 questions, and if I wasn't perfect, I'd get hit...\nMy parents and I don't have a good relationship now, and we never will.\n\nListening is a wonderful tool to create that loving bond and I hope things can work out differently.", "She has a history of lying bc you demand certain types of answers from her which don\u2019t resonate with her own inner truth. So she will tell you anything now hoping it\u2019ll suffice and you\u2019ll get off her back. Let her get a sunburn for her to learn. Don\u2019t prepave her road for her; that\u2019s called steamroll-style parenting. Let her pave her own way.", "YTA. Your daughter is afraid of you and she would rather lie and take the risk of being caught, rather then tell the truth and be punished.

Shocker\n\nLet her get burned a few times and she\u2019ll realise it\u2019s importance. \n\nYTA", "I feel like getting sunburned would be the more lasting/fitting punishment.\n\nLet her reap the consequences of her actions.", "I don\u2019t blame her for lying\u2014you sound like you get really worked up about what she does and doesn\u2019t do, for example, interrogating her over sunblock use and grounding her. \n\nI understand the dangers of skin cancer (I\u2019m very pale and have predisposition for melanoma), but your response is excessive and is likely just going to cause more issues down the line. More lying, strained relationship, etc.\n\nNo matter how vigilant/obsessive you are, she\u2019s going to end up getting sunburnt at some point, or multiple points in her life. It\u2019s better to educate (without fear), remind her, how to heal a sunburn, and find a brand that she likes.\n\nAre you using a high quality, non-greasy and non-smelling sun block? I hate the sensation of greasy lotion and won\u2019t use it, so I wouldn\u2019t expect a child to use it either. Same thing if it smells awful. Also, if it\u2019s the wrong brand, or low quality, it could be ineffective regardless. \n\nAgain, this is the wrong hill to die on. You\u2019re just showing your daughter that you\u2019re controlling and she can\u2019t trust you not to flip out over the smallest things.", "It was a small fib and at the end of the day she\u2019s a child and YOU should be helping her apply sunscreen. I\u2019m an adult and still need some one to put it on my back for me. Kids tell fibs it\u2019s just how it is.", "A 10 yo liar usually has found its her best defense. She's not heard. Her opinion and ideas don't matter. A soldier without a voice, pretends to be compliant.  YTA", "YTA. She is 10, thats still very young. Im working with children and teenagers who live in a group home. Many of them lie because they are afraid of punishment (in their case they were often beaten or punished by other very not ok things). The problem is that the child most likely wont really understand that she is being punished for lying and not for what she did, so she will lie again next time, because she is afraid of being punished. \n\nWhat I do with children who have to unlearn that behavior, I will practice with them to tell the truth. So for example a conversation would go something like this: \"so, you are contradicting yourself right now. Did you maybe not want to put on lotion? You can just tell me and I promise I wont be mad. Just say: Sorry, I didnt put on the lotion\" then let them repeat that and tell them good job for telling the truth! (Obviously you need to be sure they really didnt put on the sunscreen). Then I would also try to find out why they didnt put it on. Maybe they dont like the feeling, the smell.. Maybe something else was more interesting.. So then I would calmly explain that while I understand them, that it is important to me, because I want them to be protected and depending on their reason, I will try and find a solution. Also when I have the time at a good moment, I will talk to them about trust and why it is important that they dont lie (giving examples where you wouldnt believe them when they tell the truth or where lying could be harmful to them or others).\n\nIn the long run it also helps to think about the punishments given. If children feel safe and know they will only get consequences that are logical and also they wont be left alone (emotionally), they wont be as afraid of doing something wrong, so they wont lie. Otherwise they will just get better at lying eventually.", "NTA\n\nThis is what you should have done from the beginning. Just be sure to follow up by telling her that if she had told the truth, you would have let her go get the sunscreen and put it on and still go to the party. And even the second time, when you gave her a chance to come clean, she still would have been able to go to the party. It was the consistent lie after lie after lie that got her in trouble and cost her the privilege of going to the party. In this way she will learn that telling the truth, even after being caught, is better than compounding the lie.", "YTA for the fact that you\u2019ve talked to her about this for 3 years and should have given her consequences sooner when that wasn\u2019t working. You jumped from taking her phone away for one day to withholding a party. I would look into some therapy; it can help you with setting boundaries for her and also to find out what is causing the lying and whether it can be easily fixed. Good luck.", "NTA like you said her lying is obviously an issue and if she's not afraid to lie about small stuff now. How much worse could it get later on. I think the punishment Is fine in an instance where it's something that would have taken her just a few minutes to do and be done, turned into lying. As it gets worse however she either needs to talk to someone or your punishments need to fit the crime in severity as she gets older.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all.

Why did she lie to you if she wasn't scared?\nShe's 10, you can still try to be gentle and apologize to her, and actually be a safe person.

She\u2019s a ginger if that\u2019s any indication and she was invited to a swimming party by her classmate. I asked her if she put on sunscreen and she said she did but I had a feeling she was lying so I asked her more questions about it which just led to more lying (\u201cI put it on upstairs earlier\u201d \u201cI put it on in the car\u201d etc) which really upset me because she has a history of lying. I\u2019ve talked to her several times throughout maybe the past 3 years about how I don\u2019t want care if she does something bad, she should just not lie. Just last week she lied about something related to school and I talked to her again about not lying. This time when she lied, I decided to actually \u201cpunish\u201d her by not letting her go to the party. I feel really bad but at the same time, I feel like she doesn\u2019t take me seriously because I never really punish her. But also she thinks it\u2019s better to lie so she doesn\u2019t get punished. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m that harsh because the worst I\u2019ve ever done was take her phone away for a day. I think I\u2019m the AH because I feel like it\u2019s such a small lie but at the same time, I feel like lying about small things will eventually turn into lying about big things. So AITA for not letting my daughter go to the swim party for lying about wearing sunscreen?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A lot of things make sense now looking back. Mandate daily hygienes were really hard for me. From brushing my teeth to putting deodorant, if it's boring, it feels like climbing a mountain to do it. Hence a lot of lying to get away with it. I didn't grasp the consequences of lying until 16 or so, and by then damage was already done. Mom can't trust me, but I get angry at her for not trusting me. I know it's really unfair.\n\nWhat I suggest is body doubling. If you need her to do certain task, do the same thing in front of her while she does it. We learn better by watching rather than audio input. And don't punish lying, that will make her better lier next time. If you need to get information out of her, instead of asking \"why?\" ask \"what happened?\" Then she can explain the train of thoughts that lead her there. \n\nGood luck!", "A slight AH. I get having a huge issue with lying because I personally can't stand lying. I always told my kids I might not like what they say or do but it will be much worse for them if they lie about it.

She may have her own thing going on that is actually a root cause here that you could help her address instead of punishing her for lying when that's just the coping strategy she's worked out yeah?

So is she lying because she has an issue with sunscreen and thinks you won\u2019t listen? Or just lying to lie which as you said can become a big problem. I would start taking every lie super serious and have a long drawn out conversation about each and every lie as soon as they occur. And about the issue she lied about. As well as a consequence.

If you tell me the truth, there won't be any consequences except you'll have to go put on some sunscreen, and we can discuss the little fibbing later. But for now, last chance before it gets ugly: Did you or didn't you put on sunscreen? And take a minute to think about your response\"\n\nThis works very well because the consequences are entirely in the kid's control, and if they make the wrong decision, you can point that out later and it gives them something to think about.

Because they are afraid of someone\u2019s reaction. Because they feel (wrongly or not) that they cannot be honest without incurring anger or some other unpleasant situation. So if we want to value honestly above all else at all cost, we need to create a place where kids can be honest and know they won\u2019t be punished or scolded but instead helped. Where if they have to admit they didn\u2019t do something (because they hate it) instead of being scolded they\u2019ll hear commiseration and an offer to help (if the kid thinks something sucks, chances are good you do too or at least understand how / why they feel that way!). In what universe are we encouraging a kid to be honest when that results in punishment and lectures? \n\nFinally, I am a big fan of focusing on goals. So I try to always frame things around \u201cwhat is it I am trying to accomplish / teach and how is whatever I\u2019m doing contributing to that goal?\u201d This helps keep me from wasting time on moral outrage moves and power trip performances. \n\nSo, I\u2019m not trying to be mean here, but\u2026 soft YTA.

I think what it ultimately needs is genuine understanding and communication, though. \n\nmost of the time, I lied because 1) I felt it made me interesting to my parents, who were often very uninterested in me as a person, which made me more likely to make stuff up, and 2) I lied to avoid being shouted at and punished for things because I grew up in a very strict household where nothing was allowed to be *explained* \\- anything regarded as bad was always a symptom of me being a 'bad kid' (despite the fact I did great in school, was polite and pleasant, etc). obviously, these two things were much deeper-rooted issues, but I feel as though there's nearly always a reason for children to lie as long as those lies aren't huge.\n\nfor instance, I never lied about anything important, and I did grow out of it socially. I reached a point in my early teens where I realised there was no point in it anymore. I also remember peers in school who would lie about huge things - I remember someone who used to lie about her mother having cancer and other really serious issues and I always found it really shocking. I knew that that was wrong and I think that also worked as a deterrent for me. that being said, I also think there's a big difference between a kid like me - using smaller lies to avoid punishment or to sound 'better' - and kids who really seem to have an issue with constant huge lies, which OP's child doesn't seem to do. \n\nhowever, being constantly called a liar by my parents did absolutely nothing to stop me from lying to them or lying in general. it was honestly just social shame when/if I got caught out that made me stop. like, once I lied about getting a 'special' version of a CD of my favourite band with a special bonus song, and my friend called me out by saying it was a digital only song, lol. that was better motivation to stop lying than my parents ever were!\n\nultimately, I can't really say what I wish I'd had from my parents because it was such a multi-layered issue (I come from a home with lots of abuse and neglect, so it's really hard for me to be able to comment on a relatively normal family dynamic). I will say again that I do think communication is necessary. it seems to me that people often forget they can sit their kids down and actually talk to them about things, and that not doing this often leads to a total breakdown of communication and trust. what I would have liked was a sit-down chat where my parents tried to understand what my motivations for lying were, and where I could have genuinely explained myself to them.", "As someone who went through kind of a similar childhood: my mom never apologized or made up for accusing me of lying after it was proven I didn't, UNTIL one day my stepfather said, when I was about 9, \"I'm really glad you pushed back and stood your ground when we thought you did x thing but you didn't. You stood up for yourself when you knew you were right and that's great, I'm proud of you.\"\n\nI'm guessing my mom heard that and realized the damage she was doing -- she still wasn't very GOOD about walking it back if she found out I hadn't been lying, but she did it sometimes. In some ways I think this was even more frustrating for me as a kid because it was inconsistent and unpredictable, but I do think it improved my outcomes vis-a-vis compulsive lying as an adult.

I have the regular sunscreen as a first defence, but if I know I can\u2019t make the effort to do the lotion sunscreen, I\u2019ll spray it on. \n\nMy sister\u2019s a red head, so while I\u2019m not quite as quick to burn, the healthy fear of skin cancer is instilled in me", "It honestly is amazing and they can really tie an outfit together! Biggest thing is storing or carrying when not in use so I recommend planning for that given Disney and small kids and how they get, but I get compliments on it whenever I use it because people just don't think about them as an option.", "I wish those things were more popular and common so I could get me one. I\u2019d feel weird personally. I mean I\u2019m already weird lol. Sorry tis a light hearted joke at myself.", "And I\u2019m not suggesting swearing off sunscreen for life\u2026 but JC, one day?!", "I absolutely love this!", "Used to be that way in the southern usa but thankfully that's changing.  Though to be honest, that probably rose up, in part, due to sun damaged skin issues.", "Considering World of War craft has a large player base that is composed of senior citizens it's not that hard to believe some of them will also be on social media platforms like reddit \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "As we all know, this is reddit where obviously nobody ever potentially exaggerates anything or makes statements based on their own personal knowledge \n\n/s", "doubles compared to someone who has never had a sunburn ever? So still negligible. Great.", "a couple of hours is in itself obviously far longer than anyone was suggesting", "So then why are these people brining it up in discourse of if its a big cancer risk to let the kid get one normal sunburn?", "My family member is facing less than 6 months from metastasized melanoma.  We take skin cancer and sunblock very seriously. \n\nOne burn at 10 yo as a consequence of poor sunscreen application to drill into your head to always wear sunscreen does NOT make \u201ccancer\u201d a consequence of 1 burn. \n\nIncreasing your odds of something very unlikely is still unlikely. \n\nYou can\u2019t think of it that way over and over again, but you can think of it that way literally once.", "What I quoted came directly from the same link that the commenter that I responded to is using that they were quoting what they want from.", "Did you miss the part where OP got so frustrated over a minor lie that she punished her kid by not letting her go to a party she was in the process of driving her to? You look at that and see a calm individual who doesn't get upset over their kid misbehaving?\n\nWhat *you* do has zero to do with anything I said about OP.", "That's horrible parenting and absolutely setting your kid up for trouble in the real world.", "Constantly hovering, criticizing, and consistently questioning your child is a damaging behavior. It teaches them that every time they make a mistake, even small mistakes, they will face an emotional firing squad instead of being allowed to learn on their own.\n\nYes, parents do need to guide and help but not allowing your child to figure things out in a way that works for them crosses over into bad parent category.", "Accusing someone of having childhood trauma as a way to discredit their argument is super classy. It doesn't illustrate your lack of ability to come up with a valid counterpoint and need to resort to ad hominems at all. The condescending faux sympathy really finishes it off nicely.", "My daughter is 13. She's my size. I meanm we're still small just small adult sized. \n\nAmazon has some that come with a bag/case that get smallish.", "I'm weird and old enough to not care what other people think.", "Did you read that it just takes one bad burn to double the chance of melanoma? That\u2019s kind of like why not touch the hot oven one time or something. If it happening just one time doubles your risk of death, most parents are going to everything they can to avoid even one time", "It made a very upset five year old very happy.", "You do realize, WoW has been out almost 20 years. It also had a big player base in the military community. That means ppl who started playing in their late 50's are now senior citizens. Lol", "No shit?  That is both hilarious and unsurprising.  I'm not a gamer, since that's safest, but I've heard WoW is great fun!", "The kid kept doubling down on the lie though.  Thats worth being frustrated over rather than the kid owning up to their mistake.  \n\nMaybe im reading too much calm from their words, or youre reading too much excitement. Idk.  Seemed more like a fed up, exasperated decision than a freak out over one minor lie.", "Except that both of my kids are now adults and I got to see the results of my parenting choices.  And would do this again. \n\nYou don't have to punish your kids to use their missteps as a learning experience.", "Bear in mind there's a difference between punishment and consequences. It can be more beneficial to teach a child to come to you, admit wrongdoing, and face up to the consequences of that (such as making it right where possible, or dealing with an uncomfortable conversation), than just punitive measures over every error regardless of intent.", "That's a strong absolutist statement... Are you an expert in human development and child psychology? Parenting is a lifelong evolution. It's going to be different for every child raised. The real world will tell us what's expected of us when we're exposed to it and kids are smarter than we think a lot of the time. If a child needs a safe space where they can tell the truth and not be punished for it... Then ok. It's possible to teach morals and change behaviours without strict punishment. Also, sometimes punishment is 100% necessary. It's not up to you to tell people when it's needed.", "I agree with that completely. That said, I'm a milenial and I see far too many Gen z kids complain about \"trauma\" and being \"triggered\" over completely normal parenting behaviours. My nephew threw a shit fit because his mom told him he needed to finish his schoolwork before going skiing with his friends last year. That is messed up. Not condoning abuse at all, but I do think overusing the word triggered detracts from truly traumatic situations like the ones you described", "Accusing someone of abusing their child over a reddit post is ridiculous. There\u2019s nothing in this post that alludes to OP punishing their child over minor mistakes. Did we read the same post? Because from my understanding, OP doesn\u2019t seem to punish their child at all. What most likely happened is, the child lied to OP and got away with it ~ which led the kid to realizing that lying can get them out of doing things.", "Y'know I sort of assumed 10 or younger because that's the age of the kid in the OP, my bad! \n\nMine tend to be decorative as well as functional, so not always compact or in a bag, I tend to hook it through the straps of my backpack (I tend towards small backpacks rather than purses for day use).", "I\u2019m mostly freckles interrupted with translucent white skin.

Two of my grandchildren have freckles and I\u2019m going to tell them the loving, wise words of your father.  Thank you!", "This is not a contradiction.", "Punishment and other consequences also are not mutually exclusive. If your kid purposefully broke their sibling's toy, they should have to make it right by replacing the toy, get the uncomfortable conversation, *and* face an actual punishment for intentionally doing something they knew was wrong to hurt someone else.", "It is an absolute statement and lacks nuance. Would you be happier if I qualified it? \"Unless your children's transgressions are relatively minor and they are particularly well adjusted, insightful people, never punishing them over misbehaving/doing bad things so long as they don't like about it will most likely give them the impression that they will not have to face punishment for bad acts. This will serve them poorly in the world outside your home where admitting you've done something wrong does not excuse you of your wrong doing. These are the kinds of people featured in so many youtube videos who freak out when the police don't care that they admit to having a few drinks, they're still under arrest for DUI.\"", "Oh we millennials have reached the stage in our lives where some of us forget about being the generation that gets shit on and started perpetuating the cycle. Horrible to know.", "how is your example even remotely related or comparable to this situation?", "I didn't accuse anyone of abusing their child. I pointed out *the fact* that we don't know OP isn't abusive.\n\nYes, if you take the post at face value, OP never punishes her child - except when she does - and her kid is a compulsive liar.

Is it still required?", "I have a feeling your kids lied to you a lot.  In that scenario my child would be made to replace the toy and apologize.  Punishment suits no purpose other than to make you feel better in this scenario.", "Wow you're really aggressive on this thread eh?
