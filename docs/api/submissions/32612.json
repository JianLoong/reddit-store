You moved in to their house, rent free.\n2. You offered to help out in some way\n3. You didn't like the suggestion of how to help because it was inconvenient for you.\n4. You got called lazy, and in return called the husband a misogynist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir relationship dynamic may not be what you want or like, but it's not your relationship, it's your sisters.  If it works for them, keep your ideals to yourself.  Interfering in their relationship dynamic is a real quick way to get yourself kicked out.\n\nFurthermore - do YOU have a car? It's pretty bold of you to demand use of / chauffer service in order to help out a household where you stay for free.  You got called lazy because you were, in fact, being lazy.  How entitled of you to see being called out on your behavior by a man as an act of sexism.\n\nTake some responsibility, apologize to the both of them, thank them again for the their hospitality, and go get the groceries.", "YTA.\n\nHe works full time out of the house, your sister works part time out of the house and part time in the house (household chores).  That arrangement clearly works for both of them.\n\nYou are staying as a (long-term?) guest and, to your credit, wanted to help out. But then you refused to unless others did the chore with you (which really isn't helping at all). He might be out of line for calling you lazy, but you have provided absolutely no evidence he is a misogynist.  You owe an apology.", "YTA. This had nothing to do with misogyny : you are home all day, while he works and let your live at his place. The least you can do is suck it up and do what you can to help. \n\nBuy yourself a caddy and go to the grocery on bus 2 times a weeks. Tons of people do that. It's doable.", "So\u2026you call the person who\u2019s working 5-6 days a week to support you a misogynist\u2026?\nYou\u2026do understand about the whole \u201cdont bite the hand that feeds you\u201d right?\nYTA, nothing he said indicates he\u2019s a misogynist, it sounds like he\u2019s slowly getting upset with supporting you while you aren\u2019t doing much to contribute.", "YTA. From what you describe, he's not a misogynist, he's simply the one working full time and you should apologize.\n\nYou can in fact use a bus to get groceries. Unless there's no bus service at all, it's not \"almost impossible\". It can be inconvenient but you already admitted that you're not doing much so go get the groceries. Just don't expect to do two week's worth of groceries in one trip.  \n\nYou get a 2-3 days worth of groceries and then you turn it around and do it again in 2-3 days. If it's too much to carry, get a little grocery cart. Lots of people do this.", "Ever heard of biting the hand that feeds you. You\u2019re interfering in their relationship in less than a month.

Take the bus and contribute to the household you've been generously offered to stay in. YTA", "YTA.\n\nI can't believe they didn't kick you out for that.\n\nAlso, the word you wanted is \"sexist.\" Misogyny means the hatred of women, which is a pretty serious insult.", "So you are living there for free, using their power, water and heat, eating their food, and when your BIL suggests you help out by getting groceries, he's immediately a misogynist? YTA, sounds more to me like you're being a mooch and he was hinting that you could at least contribute some food since you're not helping with anything else!", "When you choose to move in someone else\u2019s home, you may have to live on their terms if that\u2019s what they want. \n\nI would suggest you move out and put all your energy in finding a job for your sake.", "Info:  Can you borrow the car in the evening to go do the shopping?  Why does he have to be the one driving?\n\nIt's possible that his comment about \"duties\" was misogynistic, but it's kind of tough to tell from this post if that's exactly what he meant.  I get being frustrated at not having convenient mobility to do things as grocery shopping, but I can't give a judgement on the misogynistic comment as it was unclear as to how he meant it.", "He works FT+, his wife works PT, and you don\u2019t work at all. \n\nHe could\u2019ve worded his response better, but YTA. Millions of people don\u2019t have cars but you are expecting him to work all day then take you shopping.", "Make your job getting the groceries.  You can go on the bus and grab whatever is needed for that day, and then you can go back the next day for whatever is needed that day. Go each day and just grab the amount needed for the day. That way you never have too much to carry. Also, help with meal prep and learn to cook from your sister. Otherwise YTA.", "I bus and get groceries it is not ideal and you can never get everything you need. The request for him to drive her is not unreasonable at all.\n\nTravel time (can vary greatly depending on where you live and if you need connections) and weather can wreck alot of food. And for me as a single person I can barely carry everything that i need let alone fit it on the bus without taking up extra seats which isnt always allowed to begin with, and thats with a small travel cart. Shes shopping for 3 people (from the sounds of it).\n\nJust some insight for everyone saying the bus is a fine option. And if shes only buying for herself I can agree shes not entitled to a ride but if he wants her to get household groceries he could at least drive or offer to pick her up on his way home from work even if she goes just before he gets off", "YTA. How lazy can you be? You're living there rent free and can't even bother to get some groceries unless BIL gives you a free ride? He's not a misogynist because you're a lazy freeloader", "Oof, this one backfired on you didn't it OP?\n\nYes YTA", "I don\u2019t see anything pointing to misogyny\u2026 he works full-time/over-time, your sister works part-time, and you\u2019re living in their home. Why should he need to do the chores when he gets home from working six days per week? How does sex or gender play into this at all? It just seems like division of household tasks. What do you mean you can\u2019t take the bus for groceries? Millions of people take public transit for groceries every day. Don\u2019t like it? Get a job, get your own place, get your own car.

Entitled and lazy!!!!", "He could have worded his response better but YTA to try and tell him what to do in his own home. in the days of Uber and other ride shares there are ways to get groceries.", "Did you eat before you moved in with them? How did that work?", "YTA", "YTA - Big time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is working full time. So do your duties. This has nothing to do with the patriarchy. Get a backpack and use the bus. Go two times if necessary. \n\nYou really should apologize and contribute as everybody in that household does.", "YTA. The guy working more than full-time does, in fact, get to expect the household duties will be handled by the part-time worker and unemployed person. Maybe he is a traditionalist. That doesn't give you the right to name-call. Also, since you aren't doing anything during the day, what is stopping you from getting groceries regularly?\n\nYou're going to find yourself in need of a different living situation if you don't apologize.", "YTA and why are you just cleaning or sitting around? Shouldn\u2019t you be looking for a job?", "You ever stop to think that maybe he doesn\u2019t want you in the house, and the only reason he\u2019s accepting it is that he\u2019s married to your sister?\n\nHe called you lazy. Because you\u2019re being lazy and freeloading off his home, rent free. Just because he\u2019s a man and you\u2019re a woman doesn\u2019t make that factual statement objectively offensive.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nHe's the main breadwinner putting a roof over your head and you're telling him how the house should be run?", "Don\u2019t love his attitude, but it\u2019s their house that your are staying in for free, and BIL and your sister are in agreement in how it runs.  You can toe the line or leave.  If you go every couple of days to the grocery store, it wouldn\u2019t be too bad.  Also, I get not cooking well, but you could do meal prep and clean up.  \n\nA reminder: they are inconveniencing themselves to a degree to help you because you are family.  You can inconvenience yourself a little in return.  That\u2019s how you show thanks.", "So you\u2019re a free loading mooch and you think this is misogynistic ? You are beyond delusional. Grow up", "YTA. There's no misogyny involved in this. You're just making excuses to not do stuff around the house. You're living in their house and eating their food, the less you can do is help them out with the little things.", "YTA. It isn't misogynistic for her to do the cooking and cleaning when they have no kids, she works part time and he works full time. Also, how is you doing the grocery shipping a favor of he needs to drive you there and do the shopping with you? He might as well do it himself. You're a very rude guest!", "YTA.  Sounds like the solution is for you to move out, and then you won\u2019t have to deal with his mysoginy anymore.", "YTA - you don't have to be a misogynist to call out lazy and ungrateful.  You calling him that for calling you out is you gaslighting.", "When one person is at work all day and the other isn't, there is a fair expectation that most of the household stuff goes to the one who is home, regardless of whether they are male, female, or other.  When my friend was a stay at home dad, he covered 80 percent of the household stuff.  BUT without a car groceries are tough.  I don't know that he sees that, but it isn't necessarily misogyny... could be, but not necessarily.\n\nYou COULD learn to cook those things from your sister.\n\n\nThat said, why are you just sitting around?  When between jobs, your full time job is to find another job.  Even wait tables part time while looking.  Or, spend 40 hours a week tailoring resumes etc.\n\nSo, IMO you are kind of a freeloader who isn't trying hard enough to get a job or contribute....I withhold judgement in case you are spending hours every day trying to find a job.", "NTA", "Info: is there a reason that you couldn't borrow the car in the evening or Sunday?  \n\nAlso, why is this not a 2 car household.
