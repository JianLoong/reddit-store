Don't accept this. He's acting like a child because you called him out on something he knew he was wrong about and he's refusing to acknowledge it.

Emotionally nothing. Siteing stress and depression which he will not seek help for and that I don't send him enough supportive texts while he is at work.

And he takes care of the lawn because we have a riding lawnmower and my hips are fucked up so I can't do it. He used to be so kind and thoughtful and remember the tiniest things I mentioned, but he's completely checked out now. The house we live in belongs to my family so he's not keeping the roof over ours heads. The car was mine before our marriage and is paid off. I used to work from home remote but I can't take calls anymore because you know toddler who's carrying on loudly (as he should for his age) and if I paid for daycare it would literally just eat every dollar I could possibly make.

But do your best to remember and remind him the promises you made to each other and the feelings that are hiding deep down, under the depressive gunk, and see if you guys can pull through. It is a team effort though. Btw, NTA at all. My partner also worked overnights once and it was the most depressed I'd ever seen him.
