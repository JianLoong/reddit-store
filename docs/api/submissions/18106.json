Just keep in mind that it doesn't necessarily mean I'm wrong, either.\n\nI have only encountered one other person who pushed the 'you getting upset about things upsets me' narrative. One single person in my 40 years of life who would say or do something harmful to me, then make *me* feel guilty for crying about it. My first boyfriend when I was just 17. I was in a very vulnerable situation, (parents split, abusive household, constantly bullied), and he used that.\n\nHe would treat me badly, either verbally or by pushing me into something I didn't want to do. When I got upset he would insist that he was 'just playing', or say that whatever it was that he wanted from me was 'normal'.

He used it to convince me that no one else would put up with my behaviour, that he stayed because he loved me, that he knew I could change.\n\nI did change. I stopped reacting badly when he was cruel. I stopped resisting when he pushed for things. I was terrified of letting myself 'overreact' and upsetting him because he was the only person in my life who showed me any affection.

No consideration for my feelings, no loving gestures, but if I didn't consider *his* feelings, if I didn't show that I loved *him*, or if I showed the slightest sign of being upset by his behaviour, he would immediately play the victim.\n\nHe used that to rape me. Told me that his insistence was normal, that men *needed* it. He actually made me believe that refusing him was somehow wrong, that it would lead to him losing control and forcing me. He acted as though *having* to force me would devastate him, made me feel so guilty for refusing him that I gave in.\n\nIt took me years to even admit it was rape. I still have trouble telling if my reactions to things are proportionate or not. I panic when people get upset around me.

I actually meant suck it up about Mother\u2019s Day.  It\u2019s doubly hard when both parties are experiencing depression, and in different ways.", "I mean, you know he\u2019s completely full of shit, right?", "So sorry for your loss! \n\nSomething I don\u2019t see others commenting on is that he used your $$$ art supplies (without your permission), then left them for you to clean up (perhaps he intended to clean them up after cleaning up child\u2026 but he could have communicated that to you). So he essentially he made more work for you on YOUR day. \n\nStill, when you asked \u201care we doing anything for Mother\u2019s Day\u201d The right move would have been to say, something like, \u201cwe are doing whatever you would you like to do.\u201d If he works weekends , too, I could even understand him not wanting to throw a lavish party or do an all day activity and putting some boundaries on it!\n\nOr how about, \u201chappy Mother\u2019s Day! I hope you don\u2019t mind a rain check but I\u2019m not feeling well today. I took X day off to celebrate with you instead and I\u2019ll have something nice planned.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s speaks to me that instead of approaching the situation this way, just taking responsibility for his screw up, he made you responsible for his poor judgment and couldn\u2019t be bothered to tell you \u201cI don\u2019t want any gifts or for you to do anything for Father\u2019s Day\u201d\u2026 instead making you bring up the conversation about that too.", "Before I say this, I want to be clear that you have clearly made a lot of attempts to help him and get through to him, and you are well within your rights to stop pouring time and energy into a man who refuses to help himself and blames you for being upset about that. What he did was not OK. \n\nThat said, that\u2019s some very deep and nasty shit for your husband to process. And his \u201cdon\u2019t talk about your feelings\u201d upbringing is probably interacting with that deep and nasty shit in really paralysing ways, because of course, his father would have played a big role in his upbringing and his beliefs about men talking about their feelings. \n\nIt sounds like your husband is inside a prison built by his father (what his father did) which is inside another prison built by his father (don\u2019t talk about your feelings). The tools he needs to escape the first prison are beyond the walls of the second prison. \n\nIf you want to give it one more chance, look for a help line or support group related to that monstrous topic and if possible, specifically for people in a similar position to him. With a double prison like that, rolling the dice on a therapist until he finds one he likes is probably not going to do him any good. Try to get him into an appointment with somebody who specialises in that topic or at least specialises in men who don\u2019t know how to talk about their feelings. \n\nI will say, it\u2019s a good sign that he was willing to try both marriage counselling and individual therapy. Even if it didn\u2019t work out, he was willing to walk in the door and sit down. But it sounds like neither one had the right approach for the deep and complex nature of the problem. \n\nI\u2019ll reiterate, it\u2019s OK if this is too much for you to attempt right now. You truly can\u2019t help somebody who doesn\u2019t want to help themselves, and you\u2019ve already spent a lot of time and effort trying. But if you do want to keep trying, look for someone who will know how to get their message past all those prison walls. \n\nYou can also keep going to marriage counselling solo. It will give you tools to have more productive conversations and resolve conflicts more peacefully. One person can\u2019t save a marriage by themselves, but sometimes one person can change the dynamics of the relationship enough that the other person sees the light and starts trying too.", "He went to 5 therapy sessions!

Asking for supportive text is perhaps he needs the positive reinforcement which he is struggling to find in himself. I found to be the case with a friend when they were depressed during Covid lock downs.\n\nNot saying YTA ahout the mother's day thing but does raise questions about his current mental health. Telling him to see someone is not helpful. Forcing someone to talk to someone will achieve nothing but a continuous expense. (referring your bit about 'he will not seek help'). He has to know he needs it, find a service. Let him know it's there and you will support him when he is ready to seek it out. \n\nTbh, I think your attitude to him is interesting... You say he contributes nothing yet... He works 40 hours a week doing night shifts, he is the sole income for the household as you are now a stay at home parent (which is a job I know, but it's not an income). He does the lawn and he watches the toddler as you have \"many\" doctors appointments. Which I presume interrupts his sleep schedule.\n\nI also take note to how you phrased it passive aggressively that 'he sleeps during the day' and added in 'whilst son and I are up'. Additionally, you quit working as you could not take calls as the toddler is loud... Then added as he should be... So I'm guessing the toddler is loud whilst your partner is trying to sleep? \n\nSo whilst he works 40 hours a week, you watch the little one, do some cleaning and ensure bills are checked and paid? Seems like an alright trade so far?\n\nLastly, the house is owned by the family and the car was paid off before we were married...? So what? You two are lucky to not be renting a home and not paying a car loan. What do you want him to do? Insist you move house so you feel he is 'putting a roof over your head'\n\nSo imo, I think he might be depressed because you don't appreciate or value him for the day to day, week to week contributions. He is likely tired all the time from lack of sleep (common with parents, but must be so much worse for someone on a night shift). Thank him for working 40 hours a week and sacrificing his sleep to help when you have doctors appointment.
