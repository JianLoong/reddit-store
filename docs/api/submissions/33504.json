To have been a responsible parent and raised a productive, independent, functioning adult \u2026 vs. what OP describes as co-worker\u2019s spawn \u2026 force of comparison would be pretty obvious.

Let them wallow in their jealousy.", "This doesn't sound like bragging so NTA.  You were asked a question and you answered, that's all.

It's like complaining your car sucks, and when someone mentions their Ferrari, you're mad they're not suffering from a flat tire.

I didn\u2019t have kids then, but I was happy for their happiness. I also heard some complaints. You simply answered a question. Glad you are proud of your daughter.", "NTA, he asked you answered. Also, on a related note, how did you get your kid to move out of the house? Asking for a friend.", "He ASKED you these questions. What were you supposed to do, lie? GEEZ NTA.", "NTA. They asked you questions about your daughter and your answered them honestly.  That's not bragging, that's having a conversation.

You have every right to brag about your daughter, but in this case, you were just answering the guy's questions. I guess you weren't following office culture, which states you must complain about your kids. Too bad that's not how you roll.\n\nIt reminds me of when this one annoying dude at my office complained because I celebrated my daughter getting into the prestigious public high school she wanted to attend by offering cake to everyone. He said \"My daughter got into Rutgers, and I didn't have a party.\" Uh... okay. What am I supposed to do about that? Be less joyful about my kid's accomplishments?", "NTA. He asked!", "NTA.

Or they basically accuse me of lying. \n\nYou just can't win with people.", "Nta good on you and your daughter.", "Nta I would walk right up to him and ask if he was upset you are bragging about your kid because A he asked you and B that\u2019s what parents should do.", "NTA.  You didn't brag.  Your co-worker asked questions and you answered honestly, and from the sounds of it rather matter of factly.  I don't hear anything braggadocious about any of this.  It sounds more like they're butt hurt you don't have the problems so many of them do.  He's just jealous.", "NTA, he is the AH big-time.  He had to drag the info out of you, how is that bragging?", "You answered his question!\n\nYou answered the darn ques-you\u2019re-youre COOPERATING here!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHe asked how your child was doing and you told him.

If there isn't a legitimate reason for his son to work, then he knows that his sons behavior is a poor reflection on himself.
