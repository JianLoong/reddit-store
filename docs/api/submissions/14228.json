In which case (actually even if your parents didn\u2019t allow but then it would be kinda on you) it\u2019s kinda a medical issue and you\u2019re good to go with keeping the piercing in.

Her response was a confused, \"Why would you do that?\" and then an, \"Oh, okay,\" when I said it was for shits and giggles.\n\nGrandma was kind of old fashioned in some ways, but pretty chill in a lot of other ways.

That applies to the Church of Satan of which I am a member, I don\u2019t speak for the satanic temple or other organizations.

Arguably, though, it only applies to tattooing / marking / cutting yourself for the dead, rather than generally for ornamentation. (It also prohibits trimming your beard or cutting your sideburns, but for some reason the conservative Christians getting in a tizzy about tattoos and piercings just gloss over that bit.)", "Idk, but when I got my nipples pierced, I saw the face of satan himself. Shit hurt like a mofo.", "W grandma", "Well, the Devil/Satan is part of Christianity. I've always thought that was an interesting contradiction."]}
