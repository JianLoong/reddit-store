{"id": 15944, "submission_id": "132abrb", "title": "AITA for suggesting my girlfriend to move out?", "selftext": "My girlfriend and I are together for 5 years now, we started dating when we were 21, let\u2019s call her Amber. She has a brother, let\u2018s say Kyle. Kyle and Amber grew up very close, their mum died when they were kids and their dad never cared for them, so they were staying with their aunt. \n\nSome weeks before I met Amber, Kyle and her decided to move out and get an apartment on their own. They still live in that place and I often stayed with them. When we met, Kyle was 15 years old and was really into gaming, like me, and we immediately got on well. \n\nAmber and I were almost like parents for him. Wherever we went we took him with us, to the cinema, restaurant etc. I never had a problem with that, I always cared for him and as I said, we got on really well. \n\nAnyways, he\u2018s 20 now. They still live together, I have my own apartment. Amber and I don\u2018t live together, or I never moved in with them, because we both like our space and we\u2018re totally fine with that. The only thing is: Kyle still wants to go everywhere with us. He doesn\u2018t let us have private moments. When we lock the door, he would start pounding on it and never stop it. Amber started to get pissed, me too. We both talked with him and tried to make him understand that he has to stop. As I said, when he was younger it was totally okay, but he\u2018s 20 now and refuses to do anything alone! We really tried talking to him for what feels like a 100 times, but he never understood. Amber was really stressed, she couldn\u2018t handle it anymore, so she asked me what else she should do. I then suggested that she should move, not necessarily to my apartment, we would have needed to talk about that some more. And Kyle should stay at their old place. \n\nAmber immediately started shouting at me and said what an AH I am for wanting to cut her brother out of her life. She threatened to break up with me and said that I should just go home and that she would reach out to me when she\u2018s ready to talk. That was 2 weeks ago, I really never called or texted because I respect her. She never got upset that much, we never stopped talking about a fight. \nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: Kyle has no problem taking care of himself. He has his friends, he goes out. He never had a physical problem. But when I\u2018m at their place, he acts like he can\u2018t do anything on his own and just interferes with our life. \n\nI never called her because we take sentences as: \u201eI reach out when I\u2018m ready\u201c really siriously. However, I already decided to call her Sunday or just text her if she wants to talk in the evening.\n\nAlso, I started to think that moving out isn\u2018t a solution. It was just the first thing that came to my mind and well, she asked, so I answered. I already thought that Kyle might have a serious mental problem, and maybe Amber too.", "created_utc": 1682717275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132abrb/aita_for_suggesting_my_girlfriend_to_move_out/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her brother seems to have some unresolved abandonment issues that likely stem from the loss of their mother. He likely needs the help of a mental health professional. Maybe even a family therapy with her and you since you've been playing proverbial parents to him since he was 15.", "NTA, you didn't suggest that she cut her brother out of her life, you suggested that she find her own space.  What was the point of asking your opinion if she didn't want it?\n\nPerhaps set up a date with her (without brother dearest) and talk about how to move forward.", "INFO: Wat in tarnation\n\nIs Kyle very autistic or something? Can he take care of himself?\n\nAlso, call your gf, you haven't talked in 2 weeks????  You need to talk about this.\n\nKyle seems truly mentally ill, and he needs serious help, but so does your girlfriend. \n\nIf Kyle is mentally challenged or can't take care of himself for some reason, then yeah, Y W B T A for trying to cut him off from his caretaker.", "NTA\n\nI think what you suggested was reasonable and it doesn\u2019t sound like you did so out of malice. \n\nHowever, her instantly threatening to break up with you and then going no contact for two weeks is pretty crazy to me. I personally would see that as a big red flag and maybe rethink my relationship with someone if they did that at the drop of a hat. Would she react this way in the future over any other suggestion you make that she might not like? An adult would have said \u201csorry that\u2019s not an option\u201d and told you why they felt that way. \n\nI agree with the others that it sounds like the siblings need therapy. But when you bring it up be aware that she might become angry or offended. Some people are ingrained to see therapy as \u201conly for crazies\u201d and with her prior reaction she might freak out again. \n\nHope you are able to get everything straightened out, but remember that your feelings matter too.", "NTA. Seems like you will always be second fiddle to her brother so it may be time to cut your losses.", "NTA. Your gf\u2019s brother behaviour is invasive, especially if you make it clear that you\u2019re spending time with her exclusively by locking a door and he reacts by pounding until you open it.\n\nYou both have tried to set clear boundaries and he\u2019s crossing them without further consequence than you both being angry, which doesn\u2019t seem to be enough for him to stop. Moving out is a reasonable step to take to remediate to this issue. \n\nYou didn\u2019t bring up her moving out \u201cout of the blue\u201d or for selfish reasons, she flat out asked you what else she should do because nothing you\u2019ve both done seems to work. \n\nHer distancing herself physically from a grown 20 year old sibling isn\u2019t unreasonable. She has her own life, and while you get along with her sibling and include him in your time spent with her, he\u2019s not the one you want to share a life with. So NTA. It\u2019s a tough call for her, but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s considered it, though her guilt due to being so attached to her brother must be in part why she lashed out, which isn\u2019t ok. \n\nAlso, her wanting to take time to think and reach out back to you needs to include a clear timeline (aka I need space give me a week) and guidelines (aka do we check up on each other, do we text and/or call, etc.), otherwise she\u2019s just leaving you in the dark and that\u2019s not fair to you.", "NTA\n\nI think Amber is too attached to her brother and actually doesn't mind him hanging around.\n\nYou aren't compatible any more.", "NTA. It sounds like the brother has some real separation anxiety, and apparently your gf does too. Being close with siblings is awesome, but not to the point where they\u2019re pounding on your door and demanding your attention, at 20 years old no less. Your gf needs to establish some serious boundaries with her brother. And she was an asshole for blowing up at your suggestion, and she should respect your frustration without losing her shit.", "NTA This relationship has no distance. He has issues, she has issues and until they resolve it this relationship ain't going nowhere...", "Nta. But something smells fishy given her reaction. You should inquiry further.", "NTA. Clearly the situation is not normal. The fact that Amber does not see it is concerning. Kyle (and Amber) needs to see a therapist", "NTA and you did right by never living with her. It's never gonna work until she can cut the cord so to speak. She's not his mum and he shouldn't be C blocking her from moving forward with her life. I really think you should consider new options unless she massively changes the status quo between the two when you're around. I highly doubt she will change things anytime soon. Find someone without this baggage that will drag on for years.", "NTA - you\u2019ve been together five years. How does she expect your relationship to move to the next level? Does she expect you to propose having never lived together? Or does she expect you\u2019ll move in with her and Kyle and you two can get married and have kids and Kyle will always live with you? \n\nThere are clearly some issues that need to be resolved but she needs to be willing to work on them as well as Kyle instead of taking her anger out on you.", "NTA. Kyle needs therapy, and he is emotionally manipulating you and Amber.  Things won't change unless he gets help.", "NTA.\n\nIs Amber aware that there's a huge difference between, \"You should get your own place,\" and \"You should cut your brother out of your life\"?\n\nI don't see any part of your post where you have suggested that she should remove him from her life. I see the opposite. What are you discussing is setting boundaries, not cutting contact. Boundaries are necessary for a healthy adult life. Her entire life can't be about him. She has her own life to live. And part of that is having her own space where she can think about herself and her needs.", "NTA. It sounds like Kyle is jealous. Not sure if he\u2019s jealous because he wants more time with you or more time with his sister, but since it seems to only happen when you\u2019re around so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s you. He probably bonded to you when he was younger and now doesn\u2019t understand why you no longer want to spend time the way y\u2019all did years ago. I don\u2019t have much advice other than maybe see if he\u2019d be willing to go to therapy. If he has friends and a life of his own up until you come over then not only is this invasive behavior but it\u2019s also disrespectful to both you and his sister. At 20 years old he should understand what goes on behind a locked door. If I were you I\u2019d ask her if she\u2019s willing to get someone else\u2019s opinion, so that she can see you\u2019re not trying to be malicious, just trying to establish healthy boundaries like adults, and if his behavior bothers her as well then she should be willing to understand that at some point if he doesn\u2019t stop with the disrespect she may have to go the extreme route by moving out in order to  establish her privacy. Loving your brother, and enabling negative behavior are not the same. I love my brother as well, but I would never allow this level of disrespect towards my partner and my privacy.", "NTA. But don\u2019t call her. She said not to reach out, so don\u2019t. Matter fact, you may want to start reaching out to other women.  \n\nShe\u2019s being totally unreasonable and has terrible communication skills. Dump her and her burdensome brother.", "NTA. I am guessing she might be trying to find a way out of your relationship. Two whole weeks is not \"when I am ready.\" That is ridiculous and controlling to make you leave and wait for her to call you when she feels like it. Especially after asking for your opinion. You said he only does this when you are there. Why is that? I hope you guys figure things out.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. No disrespect intended for the following observations but your gf seems like a bit of a jerk for jumping to the conclusion that you\u2019re trying to outright cut the brother out of her life. The brother is a bundle of issues if he can\u2019t understand not to interfere in private time. Shit even my 11 year old bro would respect my request. You proposed an option which probably was just more a thought than a plan and your gf goes ballistic? Nah. Sounds like they both need some help.\n\nEdit: Wait hold up you\u2019re both 26?! Wtf is her plan? Babysit her brother forever? Nah they for sure need help. NTA for sure.", "NTA Kyle and your gf need some serious help. They probably are both incredibly codependent and it scared her when you said that. The thought of not living with him probably scared her for both of them. If your goal is to stay with her, you need to know that I think they are a package deal. So, you need to decide if you can handle this being your life. I don\u2019t think I could do it, that\u2019s just me tho. But, he REALLY needs some help, your gf will need some too, and you as well. Just don\u2019t know how involved they would want you to be. She may be broken up already with you in her head. Idk this is all really wild to be tbh!", "Amber knows she should\u2019ve set boundaries a long time ago, and she\u2019s frustrated by her brother\u2019s lack of respect, but she also has guilt stemming from not wanting to leave her brother after their mother\u2019s death and father\u2019s abandonment. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to admit to herself she\u2019s been unfair to you, she doesn\u2019t want to feel the guilt for putting up more boundaries with her brother, so she did the only thing she knew how to do, lash out at you, who\u2019ve been kind, understanding, and easy to target. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s up to Amber to do the right thing, no matter how hard it feels like it will be. And until she does, she\u2019s simply not able to be in a serious relationship. You can\u2019t change her, all you can do is decide how much are you willing to put up with and how endlessly are you willing to forgive her.", "NTA, but you wanted too much too soon. She's not ready to disentangle from her brother. She's not ready not to live with him. Their past shaped their relationship and despite her annoyance, she'll cling to that. Therapy might be a better bet. \n\nYou might've had the best of intentions, it wasn't the right step in this stage of their life. In this stage of their healing from their past.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"That was 2 weeks ago, I really never called or texted\" .. but you ended the relationship, so there is no use in still pondering the situation .. that is all in your past anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I already thought that Kyle might have a serious mental problem, and maybe Amber too.\" ..
