Does she think she's the morality police like in Iran? Keep the name. Perhaps it will serve as a reminder that what others are wearing is none of her concern unless they are flat out naked and then she should just call the cops.", "NTA \n\nSo your mother harassed a stranger, the stranger named Beverly reacted and now all Beverly's are evil.
