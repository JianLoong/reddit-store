I'm on OP's side if it's the type of costume I'm thinking of, but I would like to see the costume. I think people sexualizing their children is a problem and I'm worried that her mom is doing that.", "if every parent knew how to parent, there would be no need for child protective services", "Hard disagree. If you see someone abusing a child, you speak up. If you see someone sexualizing a child, you speak up. If this were her dad, instead of her mom, insisting that a sexy nurse outfit is fine for their 11yr old, people would be rightfully flipping out. It's disgusting.  Good for her uncle for saying something. \n\nI once wore a Rockford Peach's (A League of Her Own) baseball uniform for Halloween. I was 14. Didn't think it was sexy, just an old fashioned women's baseball uniform. The amount of comments I recieved from dirty old men when I went knocking on strangers doors trick or treating with my friend was truly disturbing. No 11 yr old should be put in that situation. Her mother needs her head examined. Evil creeps exist. And she's sending her daughter out like that. NTA.", "Adult nurse costume that isn't inappropriate", "That literally made zero sense, bro what. OP literally says, \u201cadult Halloween costumes\u201d and also, \u201cskimpy clothing\u201d that means it\u2019s one of those adult aisle costumes that are very much so intended to be sexy, tf does that even mean you absolute egg.", "question: why are you defending a parent sexualizing their child?", "Looking out for children is everyone\u2019s business. It\u2019s disgusting you\u2019re okay with a kids mother sexualizing them.", "Nah man. That woman is sexualizing her child. I think I would say something too if I knew someone who is doing that.", "\"Stop sexualizing children dressed up as slutty nurses!\"\n\n\n\nLike, seriously, why do you want children to dress up in sexy, borderline lingerie type costumes? Like someone else pointed out, if you had a *picture* of a child dressed like that you'd be a creep who should go to jail, but a parent dressing their own child up and sending them out at night is somehow OK?", "In the movie Mean Girls one of the girls is in black lingerie, adds a headband with ears and says \"I'm a mouse, duh\"", "In the old country when your gran was a child 10 years old girls probably hadn't gone through puberty.", "Did you miss the word skimpy? Aka revealing aka not for a literal child", "Adult nurse costume. Google it.", "What\u2019s the question?", "I worked in a party store that really went all out for Halloween, even opening pop up Halloween stores seasonally\n\nSome costumes amazed me how inappropriate they were for pre teens and teens. I was like wtf every year. But yea it depends on the brand, some brands were worse than others.", "I mean they really run the gamut. I\u2019ve seen nurse costumes that are basically a bikini with fishnets and only can be called a nurse outfit because it has a little hat with a Red Cross on it, and ones that are like, a fluffy ruffle skirt with a little apron and everything that are only sexy because the model wearing it is wearing thigh highs and looks like a playboy bunny. If it\u2019s the first kind it\u2019s def not appropriate. If it\u2019s the second kind especially if kid wears leggings or tights under it it would be just fine", "Or its adult sized, or just not a little kids costume.", "Sending out your child in a sexy outfit is not ok in any context. Why are you defending a child being ogled at in public?", "No. That's not the way it works. Sexualizing a child is unacceptable and shouldn't be tolerated by anyone. \n\nAbuse of children is her business.", "Op is family and is her giving her opinion over the line?", "I think family looking out for a kid who has incredibly shitty parents is pretty damn important? Obviously, you can't let horrible people do whatever they want because \"it's their kid\"", "Yeah, I am 5'7\" and my best friend is 5'2\", at some point we tried on the same dress. On me, it was right below the butt, clubbing length (we were 22-23) and on her it was knee-length, appropriate for dinner with grandma. So, the 11 years old girl might very much wind up with a knee-length skirt if she's short.", "Doing a Google search I see plenty I'd be ok with my 9yr old wearing.", "Look at my main reply I was not defending her actions. I was just asking because if she did ask for his opinion she has no right to complain.", "That is what I'm not understanding. A child in adult costume is very inappropriate. OP is NTA.", "have you heard of child beauty pageants? /s it's the same thing.  there's a reason they're typically not broadcasted.", "I've had outfits called \"skimpy\" just for going above the knee. It really depends on the person saying it.", "Yeah but a skimpy outfit on an adult will be fully covering a small 11 year old. It really depends", "Ugh, as an adult man there is no way I can weight in on this without looking like a creep but look up the \u201cadult hospital honey nurse costume\u201d from party city. If OP is talking about that then yeah I\u2019d say he\u2019s being dramatic and that result came up from searching for \u201csexy nurse costume\u201d. Albeit a lot of those results were full on lingerie and would be wildly inappropriate for an 11 yr old but it does go to show how subjective \u201csexy nurse costume\u201d is. No question OP could google the actual costume in 30 seconds and link it so people can make an accurate judgment.", "Lmao on the downvotes.", "they're responding to adone asking for 'info'.  they're just looking to make sure they know what to search for.", "Or if its simply bigger on her because shes 11. So not short or tight.", "If the skirt is short enough that it's obvious the model is wearing thigh highs, it's too short on an eleven-year-old.\n\nAnd I'll just throw this in there: I have friends who are nurses, and they all HATE sexy nurse costumes because they reenforce negatives stereotypes of nurses.", "that's the thing.  nurses don't wear that anymore and it has become fetishized.  A nurse outfit now would be scrubs, a mask and a stethoscope.\n\nmy past gf was a nurse and she would want to tease me by wearing what you consider 'ok'.  it's definitely sexualized now.  leggings or tights doesn't help, christ.", "That doesn't sound right...", "This is true. But I don't know if she'd be here if that were the case.", "Hey my youngest gd is 10 and she's already like a 34C.  There's no way her parents nor I would let her wear shit like that.  I have a lovely T Rex blow up costume lol.", "Did OP say the kid was small? I was 5'4\" at age 11. So was my daughter.", "Yeah, this is what I\u2019m thinking. One of those white mini dresses that make up most of the sexy nurse costumes would look very different on an 11 year old.", "I\u2019m an adult. A friend of mine has an 11yo daughter. We fit into each other\u2019s clothes, which is helpful because the kid gets hand-me-downs from me and I can borrow clothes from her when her baby sister pukes on me or something. 11yo usually aren\u2019t little kids. \n\nAlso, assuming the costume is supposed to show cleavage, that would probably be even more revealing on a child because it wouldn\u2019t fit properly.", "I don\u2019t know those costumes are tiny.", "You're right. Shit. I'll fix it.", "I think it's entirely possible for OP to be the type to overreact to clothing.", "Trex, awesome", "I was 4 10 as a 16 year old dude. I'm 5 8 now lol. Think we need more context. I'm 31 and still can't grow a proper beard yet my sister had her first period at 9.", "I mean, I knew what you meant, but I was like: bruh, no. :)", "It absolutely is. But for the purpose of how it's presented I'm saying no. I could be wrong of course.", "Omg thank you though bc holy crap!"]}
