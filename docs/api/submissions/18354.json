To be clear, she specifically wants me to speak to her because she can hear some and can combine that with my mouth movements and context clues.\n\nWhile we were grocery shopping I was trying to ask her opinion on something. We were having a bit of trouble communicating, I tried speaking more clearly but it was loud, I realized I didn\u2019t know all the signs for what I was trying to ask about, so I finger spelled a lot of what I was saying.

She then ran off to security probably with a bogus story. Both of you guys keep practicing asl because a situation like this could have gone bad.", "NTA, she's also wrong. I'm learning BSL because I'm hard of hearing, and it's declining. Lip movement and facial expressions are extremely important when learning sign language, you are also supposed to pay more attention to the facial expressions and lip movement when signing rather than the hands because some signs are used for multiple words (please and thank you for example). So not only was she interrupting you and trying to give unsolicited advise, she also incorrectly corrected you.

Personally, I would\u2019ve just ignored the Random Woman - absolutely no attention, like she didn\u2019t exist at all. Let her buzz around like an annoying fly and make herself look like the crazy person. She clearly wasn\u2019t trying to be helpful (judging by her second comment), she was being nosey, condescending, and trying to give unsolicited advice, without considering what the context may have been. She fucked around and found out that her \u201cadvice\u201d wasn\u2019t wanted. It\u2019s one thing to stop a stranger and offer help/advice when there\u2019s an actual safety risk (for example, \u201chey, is that your baby climbing the soup shelves over there?\u201d)\u2026but that clearly wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nIf she genuinely wanted to be helpful, she could\u2019ve stopped and *asked* if you wanted some tips.
