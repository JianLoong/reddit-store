I'm learning BSL because I'm hard of hearing, and it's declining. Lip movement and facial expressions are extremely important when learning sign language, you are also supposed to pay more attention to the facial expressions and lip movement when signing rather than the hands because some signs are used for multiple words (please and thank you for example). So not only was she interrupting you and trying to give unsolicited advise, she also incorrectly corrected you. Maybe if she minded her own business, she would get told to fuck off less \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA - but maybe be more open to interaction, perhaps that woman could have helped you.", "NTA she should mind her own business", "INFO - I'm just baffled at her comment \"It\u2019s parents like you that are leaving deaf youth isolated\"!

She fucked around and found out that her \u201cadvice\u201d wasn\u2019t wanted. It\u2019s one thing to stop a stranger and offer help/advice when there\u2019s an actual safety risk (for example, \u201chey, is that your baby climbing the soup shelves over there?\u201d)\u2026but that clearly wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nIf she genuinely wanted to be helpful, she could\u2019ve stopped and *asked* if you wanted some tips.

She was not trying to be helpful, she was trying to be judgemental.\n\nHowever, as your wife's hearing may continue to decline, I would encourage you both to learn proper ASL so she does not end up isolated from both the hearing and non-hearing communities.

People need to mind their own business at least 99% more often.", "NTA If she wanted to be helpful she would have phrased it \"It is often more helpful to do x because Y\". She didn't.

Watching their lips let me see the words I don\u2019t hear and miss. Because I was born hearing it is far easier for me and i prefer it over signing. When doing things you need to use your hands for this is easier. I also have very few friends or colleagues that can sign so it is important that I have and hone these skills and not solely rely on sign language. I have family members born deaf and never once when being taught BSL and Makaton was their parents or the rest of us told not to talk as well. One doesn\u2019t hinder the other and can help when you or death person need to take in information any way you can.   \nLet me also add people get lazy in how the sign and there are so many signs for the same word it can be confusing. If I get stuck at a sign I\u2019ve never seen before I still use their lips to help fill it in. \n\nThere is always someone who thinks they are an authority in something and know better than others. It\u2019s usually the self taught don\u2019t really have a clue ones that want to show off how great am I but in actuality can sign their name and not much more.", "Even if he's 97 and the wife is 23, this has no bearing whatsoever to the current story.", "Yeah, I feel like that comment *and* the security guard only make any sense if wife looks substantially younger than OP.", "In the US it's called SEE - Signed Exact English - and its use is really emotionally charged for some members of the Deaf community.

I was even hit on by a highschooler who offered to show me around when I start next semester. The look on his face when I told him I'm 7 years older.... With girls choosing more natural looks, not wearing much makeup and starting anti aging skincare routines in their twenties, it's very easy to think they're much younger.

The whole story just doesn't make any *sense* without the age thing. The asshole woman lectured him about how to speak ASL with a child. He clarified she was his wife, and then they were followed by security. Security doesn't follow people for speaking ASL wrong. They *might* follow you if some busybody tells them \"There's a guy over there claiming a kid is his wife.\"\n\nIt's not blame for him, it's an additional level of *her* being an asshole.", "Of course it makes perfectly sense without the age jab.\n\nSome people are just busybodies, no further motive needed.\n\nAnd you are surely reaching. There is no way to know if she approached security or what she told if she looked for them.", "OK, then what did security follow them for?\n\nShe sicced security on them because she thought he had a child bride. You're so attuned to misandry, I don't know why that doesn't worry you.\n\nIt's not a jab. I'm not insulting anyone for looking young."]}
