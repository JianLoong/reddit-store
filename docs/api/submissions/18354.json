Who knows but there are plenty of reasons this could happen.", "There's also tons of stores (really its the workers lol) that don't card everyone \"under 40\". \n\nSource: am 26 and only get carded if I've shaved in the last few days. Even then not every time.", "I learned an african sign language and was told that the grammar in speaking language is different to sign language. So she might be right in some instances.\nBut she did not know you or the context.\nMany in africa do not know signs, so we use a combination of speaking, signing, and drawing pictures to communicate. \n\nNTA\n\nIt was not her place to meddle", "NTA - rude people get rude responses.

All of this because your wife is deaf.\n\nWhy are you not defending your wife by lawyering up and going after the store? That's a slam dunk (and very profitable) discrimination lawsuit waiting to happen.", "There are actually similar languages for the Deaf and HoH   SEE which is signed exact English which uses standard English grammar and syntax, people using SEE will always speak along with the signs as it's primarily used with young people learning to lip read.\n\n PSE Pidgin Signed English (also called CASE Conceptually Accurate Signed English) which simply put utilizes ASL signs but using a more traditional English grammar.  It sounds like OP and his wife are using PSE", "While we were uncomfortable we also understood that we have no idea what that woman told the staff. I doubt they would have followed us if all she said is \u201cthere\u2019s a deaf woman in here.\u201d More likely I feel she exaggerated, maybe claimed I was aggressive towards her, or that she suspects there\u2019s a battered woman.", "> In the US it's called SEE - Signed Exact English - and its use is really emotionally charged for some members of the Deaf community.\n\nThe d/Deaf community in the UK has some spectacular arseholes in it and is riddled with politics. Did you know that cohlear implants are cultural genocide?", "Thank you!", "Hearing loss and related auditory conditions are positioned very uniquely among all the disabilities that require special outside support, as it's the only one who's support is an entire system of language. The intense connection between language and culture, and the fact that many sign language dependent individuals will be primarily interacting with other people with similar disabilities can create a very powerful social echo chamber. Combine that naturally insular social structure with discrimination and lack of accessibility at large, and suddenly it's easy to see why some might misguidedly interpret that kind of thing as a threat to their way of life. It's a very important lesson to the world at large of how important it is for a society to strive for inclusivity.", "See absolutely different and now your fluent so it still wouldn\u2019t apply. Obviously you were fluent way before but people fluent in it tend to talk while signing. It\u2019s perfectly normal and anyone that can hear isn\u2019t left out of the conversation on your side. There\u2019s obviously reasons why deaf people don\u2019t talk verbally while signing. That kid gave all of you a huge advantage. You are fluent in a language that relatively few are and one that\u2019s absolutely needed in every work field out there. Your school was definitely awesome for doing this for you. And someone who has known it as long as you do, it\u2019s absolutely expected you can sign at the same pace as you verbally speak. The only reason I even know about the etiquette is because my college ASL teacher responded to why I wanted to learn ASL was partly so I would never need to have a person signing if I ever had a deaf student. At the time I was planning on a career as a history professor so there might have been a need. The teacher was actually quite rude about it but the information was still there though. None of which has actually ever applied to you. A deaf child was put into the hearing world and instead of him adjusting to you, the school decided you all should adjust for him and in disability cases, I 109% agree. Hopefully this way of thinking will catch on in these kinds of cases and we could possibly get a much better world adjusted much better to disabilities!", "Yeah, I\u2019m now an academic who studies education and looking back I am very impressed with my little village school in the mid-90s. Most schools now wouldn\u2019t do that.", "Yeah, it's really uplifting to hear that someone had that experience actually. My mother is a highly certified ESL and Special Education teacher and has had to fight tooth and nail to get some kids properly incorporated into their classrooms, especially when the students challenges are primarily rooted in a language barrier. Studies are always showing that it's so extremely beneficial for all kids, regardless of their individual educational needs, to be exposed to multiple languages, but so many teachers clutch pearls and claim they \"don't want to confuse the kids\". Diversity is strength and it's wonderful to hear stories of people taking that to heart.", "[removed]", "NTA.\n\nJust another perspective on the guard - they may have been following you to make sure nobody else harassed you. I've worked with some guards who actively do that - they will have one guard follow each of the people involved in any incident just in case.  I wouldn't take that part personally.", "She wasn\u2019t actually trying to be helpful she was being self righteous and condescending. NTA", "My sister in law is pretty much completely deaf and has been her whole life. At the very least mouthing the words (and usually speaking them out loud) is an important part of signing and they\u2019ve done it for the 7 years I\u2019ve been around and so do all her deaf friends. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen one of them just sign and not even move their mouth. Like I do that to my fianc\u00e9e when I don\u2019t want to speak but in family conversation these people are always speaking to each other with words and sign language. And not for my benefit either because I see them do it when I\u2019m not actively part of the conversation as well. \n\nIn fact when my fianc\u00e9e was teaching my ASL my first instinct was no make no expression and my fianc\u00e9e let me know that expression and speaking are just as much a part of ASL as the hand signs because they help to give context. \n\nSo yes that lady can fuck right off.

I  was born to deaf parents and my father and I would communicate by signing and speaking bc hc he could lip read. I grew up in a large deaf community and the majority of deaf people there at least attempted to speak while signing.

So I might verbally say, \u201cdid we forget to put gochujang on the list?\u201d The only word I might finger spell is gochujang, because I don\u2019t know a sign for that but she might not be able to lip read a foreign word or use context clues to piece together the sounds she hears into guessing an unfamiliar word.\n\nAnyway, I prefer looking into her eyes to talk with her rather than a screen. I understand the utility of typing, but we\u2019re not rushed at the grocery store, so why not communicate more naturally even if maybe it\u2019s slower.", "Or she could just be a dumass we\u2019ll never know", "I don\u2019t know i personally don\u2019t deal with crazy intrusive people", "Indeed. As an example, there has been far too much of a tendency to ignore the particular needs of deaf children. Forty years ago they were lumped in special schools along with wheelchair users and everybody else whose disability was assumed to make them stupid. The results were a disaster. Nowadays they are shoehorned into mainstream schools with little special support because they don't *look* disabled and left to get on with it. The results are also a disaster. Sure, some deaf children can cope in mainstream, but many need special language help, and that is often much better delivered in groups.\n\nBit of a hobbyhorse of mine.
