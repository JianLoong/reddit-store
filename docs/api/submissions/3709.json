I\u2019m the black sheep in that I\u2019m the only one not married with kids, but that\u2019s by my preference.  I love living alone, I don\u2019t want kids, and having a partner just isn\u2019t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I\u2019m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been \u201cew, never\u201d.\n\nI was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I\u2019m not anxious to have kids since I\u2019m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn\u2019t appreciate. I said let\u2019s move on, but my mom said \u201cWe\u2019re just worried about you.\u201d\n\nThis is where I\u2019m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m the only person at this table that\u2019s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I\u2019m not the one to worry about.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I brought Thanksgiving to a dead halt and no one said a thing for the rest of dinner, but my texts are radioactive still.\n\nI feel like it was probably riding the line and my mom says this has caused a lot of problems among the siblings, but also they kinda started it.", "created_utc": 1669936203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za3bte/aita_for_calling_out_stepfamilys_dirty_laundry_at/", "score": 1478, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love living alone, I don\u2019t want kids, and having a partner just isn\u2019t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I\u2019m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been \u201cew, never\u201d.\n\nI was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I\u2019m not anxious to have kids since I\u2019m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn\u2019t appreciate. I said let\u2019s move on, but my mom said \u201cWe\u2019re just worried about you.\u201d\n\nThis is where I\u2019m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m the only person at this table that\u2019s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I\u2019m not the one to worry about.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I brought Thanksgiving to a dead halt and no one said a thing for the rest of dinner, but my texts are radioactive still.\n\nI feel like it was probably riding the line and my mom says this has caused a lot of problems among the siblings, but also they kinda started it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
