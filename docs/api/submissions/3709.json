I\u2019m the black sheep in that I\u2019m the only one not married with kids, but that\u2019s by my preference.  I love living alone, I don\u2019t want kids, and having a partner just isn\u2019t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I\u2019m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been \u201cew, never\u201d.\n\nI was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I\u2019m not anxious to have kids since I\u2019m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn\u2019t appreciate. I said let\u2019s move on, but my mom said \u201cWe\u2019re just worried about you.\u201d\n\nThis is where I\u2019m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m the only person at this table that\u2019s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I\u2019m not the one to worry about.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I brought Thanksgiving to a dead halt and no one said a thing for the rest of dinner, but my texts are radioactive still.\n\nI feel like it was probably riding the line and my mom says this has caused a lot of problems among the siblings, but also they kinda started it.", "created_utc": 1669936203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za3bte/aita_for_calling_out_stepfamilys_dirty_laundry_at/", "score": 21479, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love living alone, I don\u2019t want kids, and having a partner just isn\u2019t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I\u2019m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been \u201cew, never\u201d.\n\nI was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I\u2019m not anxious to have kids since I\u2019m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn\u2019t appreciate. I said let\u2019s move on, but my mom said \u201cWe\u2019re just worried about you.\u201d\n\nThis is where I\u2019m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m the only person at this table that\u2019s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I\u2019m not the one to worry about.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I brought Thanksgiving to a dead halt and no one said a thing for the rest of dinner, but my texts are radioactive still.\n\nI feel like it was probably riding the line and my mom says this has caused a lot of problems among the siblings, but also they kinda started it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The \"medieval era\" spanned centuries, and just think of how many jobs were lucrative a few decades or a century ago but aren't anymore, or vice-versa.\n\nOut of all the professional crafts, especially those available to women and/or in textiles, spinning was the one that required the least training/previous experience while still making a living on a skill (as opposed to your body/labor, i.e. cleaning or prostitution). Spinning was not something you *wanted* to be doing for life, which is why the job was mostly done by unmarried women who quit once they married.\n\nI'd liken it to working in a call center today. Not great, but still better than almost all the minimum-wage jobs or jobs you can get without any prior education or training, generally viewed as less-disrespectable than something like fast food, and it's a job you can probably do even well into old age (as opposed to labor or food service, which wear out the body much faster and thus tend to get dominated by younger workers).\n\n...that said, it was still a good profession for women who weren't likely to marry, and it earned that reputation for good reason, so no reason not to throw that in your roommate's face.

I said No, in a friendly tone. Then she asked \"Well, is it because you don't want them, or because you can't have them?\"\n\nI was appalled and kept totally  silent. My reasons were my own & my husband's private business. But all I could think was, what if I were painfully infertile, or had suffered dreadfully disappointing miscarriages? Been devastated yet another month? And someone asked me on a loudspeaker that could be heard, both outside and inside the bank? It wasn't my case, but I knew other women who had suffered.

Their response? \"Why now?\".", "> Should she be desperately trying to shack up with any random man because \"biological clock\"?\n\nApparently that's what the steps did - there probably wouldn't be as many cheaters, alcoholics and too many kids if they didn't.

When I was single af and nearing 30 I kept getting people telling me \"don't leave it too late!\" Like, what were there actually expecting me to do with that advice???

But at the end of the day they need to respect that persons decisions and choices and should never ever constantly bother them with these questions or pressure them into a certain direction. That just feels like betrayal.\n\nA few years back I was part of a close friend group and one of the guys apparently developed feelings for me, so I got constantly asked to/pressured into considering getting into a relationship with him as we would suit each other nicely due to similar interests. The only problem was that I never saw anything more than a friend in him and wasn't even physically the least bit attracted to him, which I told everyone and which they ignored and went ahead by telling me how great a relationship between us would be. I felt betrayed and my opinions invalidated, so once we all moved to different cities and basically just let those friendships sizzle out naturally.", "I once congratulated someone for being pregnant because I knew they had been trying for a long time. There, in front of her husband, she said \"I'm not, and actually I've been told I'm unable to have children\"...So, yeah, she had just gained some weight.

She was only a few weeks away from maternity leave, was gone for about 2 months and then came back. I probably stupidly just thought she had gone into labor a bit early and asked how they were settling in with the baby... yeah, turned out she had a stillbirth. She was so gracious about it and I apologized profusely - I just happened to sit next to her rather than being on her team, so if an email went out about it I never got it.

We were so pleased to see each other again, on a daily basis, but at a different branch. Both tellers were 20+ yrs older than me. I suspect that regular teller (Anne), who had now known me for 6+ yrs, (between 2 locations) came down like a ton of Mama Bear Bricks on the rude, clueless new teller. I received the apology, nothing more was said, but I knew perfectly well that Anne, the regular teller, had stood up for me and defended me. Bless her.\n\nSoon after marriage, I learned that I had to be very careful about my church clothing. I was slim, but short-waisted, (5'5\", healthy bust, 130 lbs) so I never had a small waist or hourglass figure. Had no idea that church ladies were closely watching my midsection. I bought some pretty fabric, laboriously sewed an elastic waist skirt with a matching shirt/jacket, a  sleeveless top underneath. Pleased with my frugal ways, we went to church. An older woman we barely knew, came up and said \"Oh, you are pregnant!\" I quietly explained that I was not pregnant. She got quite huffy/angry and said \"Well, why are you dressing that way?\" I didn't reply. I was so insulted, and my husband wasn't happy with her either.  \n\n\nThe truth was that we were a struggling, hard-working young couple. I wasn't yet a great seamstress, or garment style chooser!  Had inherited my dad's broad shoulders and large ribcage, the bust line from 2 grandmothers, & a short waist.
