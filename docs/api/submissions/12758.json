It\u2019s not in the millions or anything or enough to make me quit work forever, but it was enough to buy me a decent priced house outright if I continued to add to the fund.\n\nI was renting with a boyfriend and when we broke up, I decided to move into a flat-share. Basically, there were 2 other people living there and they had a spare room. I figured I could save a bit of money by living with other people and keep adding to my house fund for like a year or two so if I didn\u2019t buy a house outright I\u2019d have a cheaper mortgage.\n\nAnyway, the landlord of our flat gave us a generous eight months notice to evict. He was pretty honest and said that with the interest rates of mortgages going up, he realistically can\u2019t afford to keep the flat anymore. He said he could probably manage alright for eight months, but after that is where there\u2019s trouble. He even said if we found anywhere within that time, he\u2019ll let us leave our lease early without any payment. It\u2019s a very good deal considering the costs of living and mortgages etc. and the time frame he gave us was more than we needed. He could have easily given us a month to leave.\n\nIt\u2019s been six months and in that time, I found a house I liked, I had the cash funds to buy luckily, I made an offer, it was accepted and I actually have the keys. I\u2019m just sorting out moving my stuff. One roommate has also found somewhere but the other hasn\u2019t. She asked me if she could move in with me. She said she\u2019s struggling to find somewhere she can afford on her own. (I\u2019ve helped her look, there are places - she just does not want to \u2018slum it\u2019 as she calls it and is looking at places beyond her budget. She is also picky and doesn\u2019t want to share with a few people. Her parents are even willing to house her but she is turning that down too) *point is- she has options and is refusing them.\n\nI told her I\u2019m really sorry but I\u2019m not looking for a roommate. She knew I was buying a house for me as I told her and our other roommate and I said when I first moved in I wasn\u2019t there for the long haul. It\u2019s only been about a year and a bit staying here. I\u2019ve also butted heads with her a lot and just want my own space.\n\nShe says I\u2019m an AH as she\u2019s in a \u2018desperate situation\u2019 with \u2018nowhere to live\u2019 and that I can help and I\u2019m refusing to help someone in need. Our other roommate says it\u2019s not my problem to house her. My counter point is that she refuses to compromise on staying somewhere cheaper when she knows there are places she can afford and she has options too. She has also had six months and knew both I and our other roommate had plans to move out alone. And also, her freaking parents said she can move back home! She has so many options that she\u2019s point blank refusing. \n\nShe may have her reasons for not wanting to move back home or want to live in a cheap place that may not be up to her standards. Yes, I can help and maybe it\u2019s selfish but I don\u2019t want to. Im a first time buyer and want to enjoy that. I selfishly want to enjoy being single AND living alone for the first time ever as I\u2019ve always had people around and I\u2019ve never had just me in my place of living. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA: yes I know it seems obvious I\u2019m NTA but I may genuinely being horribly selfish and even though I\u2019m pretty stubborn about this I am willing to admit I could be wrong and I\u2019m interested in other people who are removed from the situation to weigh in on this. I do have a niggling doubt that she may genuinely be not wanting to move down to a cheaper but not nice area for safety reasons or something and that maybe moving back home as an adult may make her feel like she\u2019ll have no privacy or something.\n\nEdit 2: this is what we butted heads over, I wrote it in a comment.\n\n\u2018We would but heads about literally anything. She would hate when I was cooking as I would only make food for me, not her. Annoyed I wanted to do my own thing after being at work all day. Annoyed that I would wash my dishes and literally just leave them to drain on the draining board for FIVE minutes before drying them. She would pick the most peculiar of things and throw hissy fits about it.\u2019\n\nShe also once threw a strop because I went on a date and didn\u2019t feel the need to tell her all the ins and outs of it? She was very passive aggressive and didn\u2019t speak to me for 2 days because I had the GALL to go out, have some fun and not go running to my roommate about it. The other roommate didn\u2019t give two shits what I did in my private life and I was the same.\n\nETA 3: unlike RM1, me and RM2 are cool and are gonna keep in contact. She was the perfect roommate. Didn\u2019t ask me questions or pry about my life. Kept to herself. Got drunk with me a few times. She\u2019s cool.\n\nETA 4: I haven\u2019t told anybody, not even my family who are helping me move that I bought the house outright. I don\u2019t plan on telling anybody or even letting anybody question if I have a mortgage or not.

That is stick to logic at all times, decisions that are carefully thought out, rather than someone having a strop and trying to guilt you into giving them their own way. Believe me, everything you believe might happen from past behaviours does happen and everything you predict comes true. There is far less drama in the end from saying no. Yes, you face temper tantrums etc for a short while, but if you give in you face months, possibly years of misery and likely financial loss from breakages mess, non payment of rent and danger from when they bring men and people to party in your home. Do not justify yourself to her, you had no need to justify yourself here. You want to live alone and she is not a good roommate, end of story. If you do take a tenant in future, get references and know your rights. If you get a partner and they move in, make sure they pay rent and have a tenancy agreement too. You are now a target for leeches. They look like fantastic partners, but they give up their job after moving in and expect you to work, do chores and take care of them. Watch out for that and guys insisting you put them on your deed. Remember women living alone are a target. It is ok to invent a male room mate to dissuade too familiar co workers etc. It is ok to get a male coat and a pair of shoes from a thrift store and put them up by the door. It is okay to put a blue toothbrush next to your own and an electric shaver and male deodorant. Do not overshare details of your life, but keep a good friend in the loop as to where you are. Lock your door behind you. (I got stalked mere weeks after my first home purchase and it isn't uncommon.)", "I wouldn't want to live with someone who tries to micromanage me, throws hissy fits and acts entitled. NTA.", "NTA\n\n> Edit 2: this is what we butted heads over, I wrote it in a comment.\n\n> \u2018We would but heads about literally anything. She would hate when I was cooking as I would only make food for me, not her. Annoyed I wanted to do my own thing after being at work all day. Annoyed that I would wash my dishes and literally just leave them to drain on the draining board for FIVE minutes before drying them. She would pick the most peculiar of things and throw hissy fits about it.\u2019\n\n> She also once threw a strop because I went on a date and didn\u2019t feel the need to tell her all the ins and outs of it? She was very passive aggressive and didn\u2019t speak to me for 2 days because I had the GALL to go out, have some fun and not go running to my roommate about it. The other roommate didn\u2019t give two shits what I did in my private life and I was the same.\n\nOK...are you serious? If nothing else, even if you morally, ethically, and NTA-wise had any kind of obligation, this alone should easily tell you all you need to know. You can't and shouldn't live with this person.

She has options but her pride and ego are getting in the way.  If you let her move in she will never leave, she will probably try and take over the property, and getting rid of her would be a nightmare.  Don\u2019t leave anything behind that might have your new address on it, don\u2019t tell anyone where the home is.", "NTA but you know this. Rm1 has some serious issues she needs to start sorting out with a therapist.", "No way! She is not your responsibility. She has other options and doesn't need to be homeless. She is just trying to make you feel guilty.  You and she obviously don't get along well and I doubt that things would be any better and then you would feel guilty again when you ask her to move out. Your first responsibility  is to yourself. Enjoy your new home.", "NTA", "NTA. Time to cut the cord. It sounds like she\u2019s codependent and honestly it much of a friend. Go your own way. She\u2019ll have to figure it out!", "She doesn\u2019t know if I have a mortgage or if I bought it outright. I haven\u2019t even told my family who are helping me move cos it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.", "Edited to add - Sorry about your mom. Between that and breaking up with your bf you deserve a peaceful place to live.\n\nThe theme with all your examples is that she is a taker. Whatever you have, whether it is fun, food, energy, housing, she will take.\n\nPls don't feel guilty about having your own house. She will sort out her own problem and no way will her parents let her be homeless.\n\nDo not let her stay over or move her stuff into yours \"temporarily\". If you're uncomfortable now you'll be 10x as uncomfortable getting rid of her down the road.\n\nStart changing the story. Tell her your loan fell through so now you're buying with your family and expected to have space for them to stay there.", "NTA\n\nDo Not Let Her Move In!!!  Re-read your Edit 2----do you really want to live with someone who's going to be annoyed at you for EVERYTHING, while living in YOUR house? \n\nTake that niggling part out of your head & bury it in the garden! She is certainly NOT desperate, as you said, she has options----she just doesn't like those options. If you let her move in, you will never get her out!\n\nLearning to live alone takes a bit of getting used to, but you'll enjoy the peace & quiet, having things organized the way you want, and just plain relaxing in your own space.\n\nEnjoy your new home!", "She knows you buys a house and planned to move in with you from the start. So everything is too shitty and what she want is of course too expensive. Parents, oh no, but living with you is fine? She didn\u2019t want to find a new place, she wanted to move in your new shiny house.", "I'd bet if you let her move in, it would become a struggle to get her to pay you rent because \"you dont have a mortgage! You're just making money off of her! How unfair!\"\n\nEnjoy your space OP. NTA.", "She's allowed to be picky and not like any of her other options. You're allowed to not like the option of her moving in with you.\n\nStop thinking about her and move on.", "That\u2019s on her. If she wants a nice place then get a weekend job!", "Is there some reason why you want to let this woman live with you, other than pleasing her?   \n\n\nAre we on the same page as to what that means? To me, the phrase means that you do things that you don't want to do, just because someone else wants you to.   \n\n\nSo, for example, you might want to live on your own, but chose to not do so because someone want to live with you.", "Well that\u2019s good. Seriously, keep that to yourself. Otherwise people will constantly say, \u201cwhy can\u2019t you loan me money or let me stay for free, you don\u2019t even have a mortgage?!\u201d But definitely don\u2019t feel bad. She asked, you answered, and it seems you don\u2019t really care for her as a person, so try not to worry about hurting her feelings. She\u2019s just trying to manipulate you right now."]}
