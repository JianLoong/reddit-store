{"id": 12758, "submission_id": "11wora0", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my roommate move in with me into my new house and leaving her with \u2018nowhere to live?\u2019", "selftext": "My mum died in 2021 and after all the paperwork was sorted and her assets divided amongst me (27F), my dad and my brother, I received a significant sum. It\u2019s not in the millions or anything or enough to make me quit work forever, but it was enough to buy me a decent priced house outright if I continued to add to the fund.\n\nI was renting with a boyfriend and when we broke up, I decided to move into a flat-share. Basically, there were 2 other people living there and they had a spare room. I figured I could save a bit of money by living with other people and keep adding to my house fund for like a year or two so if I didn\u2019t buy a house outright I\u2019d have a cheaper mortgage.\n\nAnyway, the landlord of our flat gave us a generous eight months notice to evict. He was pretty honest and said that with the interest rates of mortgages going up, he realistically can\u2019t afford to keep the flat anymore. He said he could probably manage alright for eight months, but after that is where there\u2019s trouble. He even said if we found anywhere within that time, he\u2019ll let us leave our lease early without any payment. It\u2019s a very good deal considering the costs of living and mortgages etc. and the time frame he gave us was more than we needed. He could have easily given us a month to leave.\n\nIt\u2019s been six months and in that time, I found a house I liked, I had the cash funds to buy luckily, I made an offer, it was accepted and I actually have the keys. I\u2019m just sorting out moving my stuff. One roommate has also found somewhere but the other hasn\u2019t. She asked me if she could move in with me. She said she\u2019s struggling to find somewhere she can afford on her own. (I\u2019ve helped her look, there are places - she just does not want to \u2018slum it\u2019 as she calls it and is looking at places beyond her budget. She is also picky and doesn\u2019t want to share with a few people. Her parents are even willing to house her but she is turning that down too) *point is- she has options and is refusing them.\n\nI told her I\u2019m really sorry but I\u2019m not looking for a roommate. She knew I was buying a house for me as I told her and our other roommate and I said when I first moved in I wasn\u2019t there for the long haul. It\u2019s only been about a year and a bit staying here. I\u2019ve also butted heads with her a lot and just want my own space.\n\nShe says I\u2019m an AH as she\u2019s in a \u2018desperate situation\u2019 with \u2018nowhere to live\u2019 and that I can help and I\u2019m refusing to help someone in need. Our other roommate says it\u2019s not my problem to house her. My counter point is that she refuses to compromise on staying somewhere cheaper when she knows there are places she can afford and she has options too. She has also had six months and knew both I and our other roommate had plans to move out alone. And also, her freaking parents said she can move back home! She has so many options that she\u2019s point blank refusing. \n\nShe may have her reasons for not wanting to move back home or want to live in a cheap place that may not be up to her standards. Yes, I can help and maybe it\u2019s selfish but I don\u2019t want to. Im a first time buyer and want to enjoy that. I selfishly want to enjoy being single AND living alone for the first time ever as I\u2019ve always had people around and I\u2019ve never had just me in my place of living. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA: yes I know it seems obvious I\u2019m NTA but I may genuinely being horribly selfish and even though I\u2019m pretty stubborn about this I am willing to admit I could be wrong and I\u2019m interested in other people who are removed from the situation to weigh in on this. I do have a niggling doubt that she may genuinely be not wanting to move down to a cheaper but not nice area for safety reasons or something and that maybe moving back home as an adult may make her feel like she\u2019ll have no privacy or something.\n\nEdit 2: this is what we butted heads over, I wrote it in a comment.\n\n\u2018We would but heads about literally anything. She would hate when I was cooking as I would only make food for me, not her. Annoyed I wanted to do my own thing after being at work all day. Annoyed that I would wash my dishes and literally just leave them to drain on the draining board for FIVE minutes before drying them. She would pick the most peculiar of things and throw hissy fits about it.\u2019\n\nShe also once threw a strop because I went on a date and didn\u2019t feel the need to tell her all the ins and outs of it? She was very passive aggressive and didn\u2019t speak to me for 2 days because I had the GALL to go out, have some fun and not go running to my roommate about it. The other roommate didn\u2019t give two shits what I did in my private life and I was the same.\n\nETA 3: unlike RM1, me and RM2 are cool and are gonna keep in contact. She was the perfect roommate. Didn\u2019t ask me questions or pry about my life. Kept to herself. Got drunk with me a few times. She\u2019s cool.\n\nETA 4: I haven\u2019t told anybody, not even my family who are helping me move that I bought the house outright. I don\u2019t plan on telling anybody or even letting anybody question if I have a mortgage or not.
