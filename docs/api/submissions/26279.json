This is about my son (10 months old). My son weighed 4.4kg at birth and currently weighs 10.3kg\nWhen my son was 6 weeks old my MIL asked to spend the day with him. I was not comfortable but my husband kept asking so one morning I packed enough breast milk to feed a baby for an entire week and sent my boy to my MIL. I kept calling my husband every hour to call his mother and check up on him. He told me the baby is fine. Fast forward in the evening I went to pick him up and my boy was as light as air and looked unconscious. Without questions, I bottle fed him because I thought he needed food and feeding directly from the breast will be too hectic for him. My boy finished a full bottle and was still crying. I started crying too and rushed him to the hospital. I am a first time mom. I can't describe what happened to the fullest because I was panicking.\nThe doctors set an IV on him right away. Later MIL told me my son was too heavy for a six weeks old, also she believes frozen milk is spoilt and babies need fresh milk so she didn't feed him. She instructed me to leave my boy to him for 12 full hours and she kept saying he is fine but she didn't feed him even a drop of milk. \nI was furious and promised to never leave my boy for him again. \nWhen he was 4 months, my SO again kept nagging and said his mom is worrying him about the baby and we should forgive her. I said no but gave in a month later. I only left the boy for three hours with her. I went to meet my boy crying and in pain. He was burning with a high temperature. I again rushed him to the hospital. Later found out MIL rubbed a balm with mentol and other herbs on him. Her reason being that when his daddy was born, he was very fair with lots of hair but my son is not so the cream will make him fairer with lots of hair. Again, she didn't also feed him because as she said the baby is too heavy. \nThis also past and I listened to my husband and calmed down. For the past month, my husband has started nagging about his mother wanting to spend the day with her grandson. He ask me everyday. I told him today that as long as I am his mother, his mother will never set eyes on my boy. I did not only give birth for his mom to murder my boy for me. \nAITA for refusing my MIL access to my son for a full day?\nMy SO think am because everyone deserves forgiveness.", "created_utc": 1693948891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16b0m71/aita_for_keeping_my_son_away_from_my_mil/", "score": 2031, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be wrong if you if you DID leave him with her! \n\nSupervised visits? Perhaps. Very closely supervised. \nUnsupervised visits? Not a chance. Hard stop. Not for one single minute. \n\nI\u2019d make this my hill to die on.

Your MIL could have killed your child twice already, and your husband doesn't seem to care. She is not safe for him to be around and if it were me, she would never see my child or me again. If you think that's not an option, then at the very least, she should never be around him unsupervised. Why can't she come to visit him at your home when you're present?", "NTA Keep that woman away from your child! You can\u2019t trust her to behave reasonably and not put your child in danger.", "I can't believe you gave her a second chance. The woman is batshit crazy. Starving a six week old baby?

My bad, English is not my first language. So, I said a lot of \"ask your child if he even wanted to go there\", but that's not the point.

She WILL kill him, on purpose or not, just because... yeah, MomOfTheCentury she is.", "NTA, and not everyone deserves forgiveness. Your MIL has done unforgivable things to your infant son, and your husband is a mama's boy.\n\nAnd now MIL is scheming to take advantage of some opportunity, when your back is turned, to get her hands on your child and show dominance over you. Maybe a health emergency in your family.\n\nBut if you leave your child alone with your husband, he will contact hideous MIL and give her her chance. He can't help himself.

Your infant son has gone to the hospital twice now because of your MIL and your husband does not seem to care at all that she not only starved your baby but also put him in danger by using a balm that caused a fever. I am not one to cry divorce but if I was you I would not trust my own husband and father of my child to keep him safe.

She starved your baby more than once. \n\nThis is not her baby, this is not a copy of her husband for her to do what she wants with, this is your baby. It would be irresponsible to leave baby in her care. How irresponsible is your husband? Why does he think this is okay? What will it take for him to put the baby above his mother's nagging? \n\nFWIW you cannot change a baby's hair or eye color. If she finds something that can, it all says not to use one babies. \n\nBaby did not die because you took prompt action and had access to medical care.

Your husband \"forgave\" her for *hurting his child.*\n\nShe wasn't a fit parent, and she didn't raise her son to be one, either.", "NTA. Screw forgiveness, that woman is dangerous to an infant.", "NTA. Protect your baby from the crazy MIL and put your foot down with your husband. Maybe have your pediatrician explain to him the danger that his mother put your child in.", "NTA. Your child isnt even 1 yet and MIL has put him in hospital twice.

I think she was at least two (maybe three?) when she had her first sleepover with grandma. It\u2019s weird the mother even agreed!", "Should have told the doctors at hospital they would maybe have called police on child abuse charges. Do not know if they are in canada or states. Never ever leave baby and do not trust husbandto  not give in and give her child to see without supervision. She should tell everyone on both sides of family what mil did.", "Yup. Too many people saying it\u2019s a husband problem. This is an OP problem. She is a neglectful parent for endangering her newborn to appease her husband/MIL. Shame on her.", "She was upset and just couldn't stand up for her own poor baby. Good god.", "Tbh, i dont think that will work. Not because youre wrong, but because there are many religions which have fasting, including no liquids sometimes, as a yearly practice.\n\nFasting as a healthy adult isnt anything like as risky as a newborn fasting. He'd have to fast something like 36-48 hours straight to understand. But that would also put him at medical risk, which - yeah, is kind of the point - but still isnt an amaxing idea for someone with a kid who may be supervising said kid. (Although i kind of doubt this particular dad does many 'dad\" things other than working \ud83d\ude12)", "This mother is worse than the one that kicked Miette", "Apparently the child is not safe around his own mother either, bc she knowingly sent her infant son to an abusive environment.", "No water, coffee or other beverages for three days either. That's the equivalent of what his incubator did to his infant child.", "Exactly this!!!!", "The whole story is insane. [Here's](https://www.crimeonline.com/2023/03/30/florida-principal-leaves-granddaughter-to-die-in-hot-car-months-after-infant-grandson-drowns-in-her-care-police/) a pretty detailed article.", "I'm beginning to wonder if OP's husband was similarly abused as a child, so he kind of thinks this is normal.", "Beyond the MIL problem, OP has a husband problem. That man needs to step up and do his job as a father by protecting his son and wife from his mother.", "Husband needs to grow a whole damn skeleton at this point.", "Or some balls", "This *really* depends on culture - overall and familial.\n\nIve babysat for teeny babies before as a teen. Some folks do feel comfortable leaving little babies with caregivers, even unrelated ones. Just look at how many people send babies to daycares.", "I had my mother babysit my 3 weeks old for 12 hours, and my mil for 9 hours at 6 weeks old. There was absolutely no problem, my baby was 100% safe and taken care of, with pictures and updates every 2 hours. \nBUT if my baby girl ever got the treatement OP's baby suffered,  i swear to god, grandma would never see us again.", "OP has a self problem, because she gave in and prioritized her husband and MIL over the safety of her infant son.", "I can\u2019t believe how many aita\u2019s im reading about bf\u2019s/husbands being such children about their mummy. It\u2019s really gross and the fact it\u2019s coming at the expense of their partner and children THAT THEY CHOSE TO HAVE AND BE WITH is disturbing", "That's definitely cultural. I think the first time my parents took care of my daughter for a full day she was 6 months or so. I would find the question: \"can I take care of your kid alone\" a little weird. My mom will call me from time to time to see her granddaughter, but just to visit.\n\nMy daughter will have her first sleepover at grandparents' in a couple of weeks. She'll be 1 year old.", "Yeah, but daycares are licensed, and would be shut down if they treated babies like the MIL did. I would say it would be fine in most cases to let a grandparent watch their newborn grandchild for a few hours, because they already successfully raised their own children, so generally they know what to do. But clearly MIL is the exception and should never be left alone with any child.", "Absolutely unbelievable!!!!!  \ud83d\ude27"]}
