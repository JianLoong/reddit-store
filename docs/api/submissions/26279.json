This is about my son (10 months old). My son weighed 4.4kg at birth and currently weighs 10.3kg\nWhen my son was 6 weeks old my MIL asked to spend the day with him. I was not comfortable but my husband kept asking so one morning I packed enough breast milk to feed a baby for an entire week and sent my boy to my MIL. I kept calling my husband every hour to call his mother and check up on him. He told me the baby is fine. Fast forward in the evening I went to pick him up and my boy was as light as air and looked unconscious. Without questions, I bottle fed him because I thought he needed food and feeding directly from the breast will be too hectic for him. My boy finished a full bottle and was still crying. I started crying too and rushed him to the hospital. I am a first time mom. I can't describe what happened to the fullest because I was panicking.\nThe doctors set an IV on him right away. Later MIL told me my son was too heavy for a six weeks old, also she believes frozen milk is spoilt and babies need fresh milk so she didn't feed him. She instructed me to leave my boy to him for 12 full hours and she kept saying he is fine but she didn't feed him even a drop of milk. \nI was furious and promised to never leave my boy for him again. \nWhen he was 4 months, my SO again kept nagging and said his mom is worrying him about the baby and we should forgive her. I said no but gave in a month later. I only left the boy for three hours with her. I went to meet my boy crying and in pain. He was burning with a high temperature. I again rushed him to the hospital. Later found out MIL rubbed a balm with mentol and other herbs on him. Her reason being that when his daddy was born, he was very fair with lots of hair but my son is not so the cream will make him fairer with lots of hair. Again, she didn't also feed him because as she said the baby is too heavy. \nThis also past and I listened to my husband and calmed down. For the past month, my husband has started nagging about his mother wanting to spend the day with her grandson. He ask me everyday. I told him today that as long as I am his mother, his mother will never set eyes on my boy. I did not only give birth for his mom to murder my boy for me. \nAITA for refusing my MIL access to my son for a full day?\nMy SO think am because everyone deserves forgiveness.", "created_utc": 1693948891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16b0m71/aita_for_keeping_my_son_away_from_my_mil/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not for one single minute. \n\nI\u2019d make this my hill to die on.

Your MIL could have killed your child twice already, and your husband doesn't seem to care. She is not safe for him to be around and if it were me, she would never see my child or me again. If you think that's not an option, then at the very least, she should never be around him unsupervised. Why can't she come to visit him at your home when you're present?", "NTA Keep that woman away from your child! You can\u2019t trust her to behave reasonably and not put your child in danger.", "I can't believe you gave her a second chance. The woman is batshit crazy. Starving a six week old baby?

My bad, English is not my first language. So, I said a lot of \"ask your child if he even wanted to go there\", but that's not the point.

She WILL kill him, on purpose or not, just because... yeah, MomOfTheCentury she is.", "NTA, and not everyone deserves forgiveness. Your MIL has done unforgivable things to your infant son, and your husband is a mama's boy.\n\nAnd now MIL is scheming to take advantage of some opportunity, when your back is turned, to get her hands on your child and show dominance over you. Maybe a health emergency in your family.\n\nBut if you leave your child alone with your husband, he will contact hideous MIL and give her her chance. He can't help himself.

I am not one to cry divorce but if I was you I would not trust my own husband and father of my child to keep him safe.

What will it take for him to put the baby above his mother's nagging? \n\nFWIW you cannot change a baby's hair or eye color. If she finds something that can, it all says not to use one babies. \n\nBaby did not die because you took prompt action and had access to medical care.

Your husband \"forgave\" her for *hurting his child.*\n\nShe wasn't a fit parent, and she didn't raise her son to be one, either.", "NTA. Screw forgiveness, that woman is dangerous to an infant.", "NTA. Protect your baby from the crazy MIL and put your foot down with your husband. Maybe have your pediatrician explain to him the danger that his mother put your child in.", "NTA. Your child isnt even 1 yet and MIL has put him in hospital twice.

He is still little baby", "THIS x 1000!", "No.  \n\nI\nDon't\n\nThink so.", "Fucking paragraphs might be against the rules.", "And to add, NTA for saying no, YTA for letting her have a second chance", "He says his mother calls him more than three times a day asking to spend the day with her grandson and the frustration is getting to him and interrupting his work, sleep and peace of mind. He just wants his mother to stop frustrating him. I asked him if he wants that at the expense of his son's life. He told me his mom is even crying now because of that.", "Honestly, she can't leave/divorce him. If she does and he has split custody of the baby you know he will let MIL watch the baby.", "Honestly if I were you I would get the medical evidence and go see a lawyer about a restraining order. She is actively harmful to your baby. You need to protect him.", "That's probably because she's abusing him OP. I feel like you and your husband aren't taking this seriously enough.", ">For some strange reason my baby won't allow her touch him.\n\nit's not a strange reason. your baby remembers this person has *hurt him*. BADLY.", "So she is a racist on top of being abusive? She sounds worse by the second.", "Please stop exposing your child to this monster.", "There's nothing strange about that at all.  Babies do remember things even if they can't verbalise it.  Your son remembers your mother starving him and also hurting him with what she put on his skin.  He remembers her sound and her smell and the uncomfortable feelings he got when he was with her.  First the empty belly that was probably hurting... and then the empty belly  followed by burning skin.\n\nNext time she comments on the behaviour and that it's you around, bluntly tell her that he remembers how she hurt him as a baby and he doesn't want to be around her to give her another chance to hurt him again.", "And it is your job to protect him!  He is completely helpless - his fussing when she is near is how he tells you that even he knows she is a danger. \n\nReally, as others have said, this is a hill to die on, so to speak.  Protect your child; to hell with MIL's feelings.", "I don\u2019t give a single shit how big or long her tantrum is. And I would bet money that if your husband stopped entertaining her crap, she would knock it off. He\u2019s part of the problem here, OP.", "Tell him to block his mother's calls. His happiness does NOT come before the babies safety, or you can dump all of them together and run with your baby for the hills.\n\nIdk much about your relationship with him so I hope he's a good father and husband, and y'all can sit down and talk about this and why none of this was ok. Tell him that his mother harassing him so that she can put his child in danger again needs to be confronted and put a stop to or he may just end up having to host a funeral for the baby and risk losing his wife, too. Obviously say what you want, my words should not be repeated verbatim.", "Then block her ffs! Don't give her your baby!", "Welp tell your husband to skip of day of eating and see how his son felt.", "So he can\u2019t handle a tantrum from an adult\u2026how will tantrums with children go? OP, you got to them your husband to drop his mom and go with you to counseling to work out how you two parent moving forward. Stat.", "So he needs to not take her calls and tell her NO. Problem solved.", "If he can\u2019t deal with her nagging then he can block her number for gods sake. She harmed your child twice! I\u2019d be wanting to press charges so you can show the pattern for the restraining order you\u2019re going to need at some point. \n\nI hate to say it, but I also would be leaving the baby with his dad til I\u2019m certain he understands how badly his mother has harmed him. And that he is as passionate as keeping him safe as you are", "I\u2019m sorry that you have to parent not only your newborn baby but a full grown up adult male who can\u2019t deal with HIS crazy mum and just dump it on YOU.", "So freaking what if she's crying? Your child cried as she tortured him and neither she nor your husband seem to care about that at all. If he does not want to be frustrated by his mother, tell him to block her number and quit taking her calls because you are not turning your child over to this insane woman to be unalived. Frankly, I'd consider reporting him to CPS for continuing to demand that a vulnerable infant be turned over to an insane person. Stand your ground and leave if you have to, this is indeed your hill to die on for the sake of your child.", "Then the solution is to block his mother\u2019s phone calls, not put his infant son\u2019s life at risk. \n\nYour husband is a wimp, who is willing to use his son as a meat shield so he doesn\u2019t have to stand up to mommy.", "F that!!! NEVER EVER trust her to have unsupervised visits with LO. She can cry all she wants! ( My Grandma used to say \u201cThe more she cries the less she\u2019ll pee.\u201d) She has some type of mental health issues IMO.", "He needs to tell her it\u2019s never going to happen and to stop asking. He needs to deal with her and stop asking you.", "Ask him which is worse: MIL crying three times a day or you crying for a lifetime over a dead baby?\n\nDoes your husband even care about his child's safety?", "Hell no!  Tell your husband to grow a pair and stand up to mommy to protect his own son.  NTA", "Your husband needs to grow up and stop being a mommy's boy. She can only harass him and interrupt his work if he picks up the phone, which he is choosing to do. \n\nHe's trying to avoid his own emotional discomfort at having to set boundaries with his mother by passing the blame onto you. He doesn't care that you will then be feeling (rightfully) upset and your child could be in physical danger. His priorities are clearly himself, his mother with you, and your child coming way down the list.", "Well he should block her on his phone.  Why would he be in contact with someone who is clearly racist (wants to lighten his skin), starves and abuses his child?  He can forgive her but you don\u2019t have to.  Also forgiveness does not mean forgotten. She can\u2019t be trusted and honestly I wouldn\u2019t trust my husband if he acted this way.", "Long past time for your husband to develop a spine.  He should block his mother's calls during his work day, at the very least.   Actually,  he should tell his mom she only get supervised visits, lasting 30 minutes, at most once a month.  MIL is not well.  Do not, under any circumstances,  allow her to be unsupervised with your child.", "block her number from his phone", "If he can\u2019t grow a spine and tell his mother to fuck off that\u2019s HIS problem. Not yours and certainly not your child\u2019s. She has shown you she can\u2019t be trusted to adequately care for your child. End of story. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through all of this. You are NTA but if you continue to allow her unsupervised around your child you will be TA.", "Tough shit. Your husband is also spineless.", "He needs to block her number. I would have called the police on her for starving my child. Do not let her near your precious baby again.", "Any divorce lawyer who sees the husband defending the MIL after she put their baby in the hospital twice will be able to get full custody. I\u2019m not a lawyer but \u201cdefends putting the baby in danger\u201d seems like the kind of detail that helps argue against split custody.", "She put a chemical skin-lightener on him the second time she had him alone; yes she's racist. \n\nAnd most lighteners have bleach in them.\n\nSo OP's mom in law likely *bleached* the baby and the father is *still* not taking this seriously.", "Wanting to spend time with a newborn WITHOUT their parents present is a massive red flag.\n\nThe fact that she continues to want to see your child without anyone there is incredibly weird.\n\nYou have a husband problem.\n\nKeep that baby away from her.", "Exactly! My blood is practically boiling reading this. My son was born a huge baby- really long and heavy- and no one (not even the medical professionals) told me to stop feeding him. I would have stopped after the first visit- no one gets a second chance to harm my child and definitely not a third. Husband needs to deal with his mother.", "Of eating and drinking. We tend to forget that milk is also the only way babies get hydrated. They can absolutely die of dehydration way faster than you'd expect--I think that poor child almost did.\n\nNot trying to take away from your point, just this thought's been burning a hole in my brain since I read the post.", "Actually, a healthy adult skipping a day of eating isn\u2019t usually a big problem. It won\u2019t kill him, and it could kill his son!", "Agreed go without water too", "Yes but at least he can feel hungry", "True. I\u2019m just imagining him saying something like, \u201cit\u2019s no problem, it won\u2019t kill him\u201d. Her husband is more worried about his mommy being sad and bothering him, than he is about his son\u2019s life."]}
