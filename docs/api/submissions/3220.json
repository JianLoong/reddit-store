{"id": 3220, "submission_id": "z4grjk", "title": "AITA for calling my wife out on her BS during Thanksgiving dinner with her side of the family?", "selftext": "My wife (29f) and I (29m) have been married almost 5 years now. Since our daughter\u2019s been born, she\u2019s become\u2026 let\u2019s say more militant\u2026 about feminism and women\u2019s rights than she has in the past. I 100% support her in her endeavors but sometimes it can be a bit, especially when she makes snide comments about men whenever my friends are over. \n\nYesterday, during Thanksgiving dinner with her family (who, let me say are extraordinarily conservative and were against us being together as we\u2019re an interracial couple), her dad and I were discussing politics and, while I don\u2019t agree with everything that he thinks about our nation\u2019s polity, he made some interesting points that I thought were more in line with my/our views. The gloves came off, my fellow potential a-holes. \n\nLet me just say, I am of the opinion that even if you\u2019re right about something, you can be wrong about how you come off to others about it. And if you can\u2019t be nice when you speak, then don\u2019t speak at all. It\u2019s just the way I was raised. \n\nI don\u2019t strictly disagree with what she said, but in the back and forth banter of it all, she said, verbatim \u201cOh that\u2019s right, I forgot, you\u2019re always right about everything.\u201d Read all the sarcasm that there is folks. Now, my wife and I have an agreement about presenting a united front, particularly in front of her folks, because they\u2019re the sort of people that will use any conversation had with them as ammunition against you in a later conversation. So I was very taken aback by that statement as 1) I\u2019m not passive, but I\u2019m sure as heck not the person that has to be right all the time and 2) shock factor that we\u2019re going to have to deal with her folks about that statement later at some point.  \n\nI admit, my response may be a-hole worthy. I calmly said back to her \u201cBabe, you can be right about whatever it is we\u2019re talking about and not be a smartass about it in front of your family.\u201d \n\nLong story short, she\u2019s not talking to me at the moment. I don\u2019t feel guilty per se except that maybe I threw more fuel on the flame with her family, but what do you guys think. AITA?\n\nEdit: Grammar\n\nINFO update:  (I don\u2019t know if I should respond to individual comments or not, so I thought I\u2019d post responses up here, sorry if it\u2019s wrong!) A couple of people have asked what we were discussing beforehand. My FIL and I were discussing fiscal responsibility and the state of the welfare program in the U.S. Politics and religion are major conversation points for FIL and I and we bonded over being able to have differing perspectives and having good dialogue despite the fact. Thanksgiving is typically full of political talk - has been for the past four years. My wife made a comment about men not seeing things correctly because we\u2019ve run the country for the past four centuries and I said something to the effect of \u201cthat\u2019s not fair or right concerning me because as a black man that statement isn\u2019t true.\u201d To which she responded as the story above goes.\n\nINFO: To address the health of our marriage. Literally, this sort of thing (this situation) is so uncommon that it was legitimately baffling to me why people were bringing up our marriage. My wife and I love each other very much and our daughter and her future is priority one for us outside of the health of our marriage.", "created_utc": 1669391847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4grjk/aita_for_calling_my_wife_out_on_her_bs_during/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like all three of you did agree (\u201dmy/our view\u201d)? And what was the bantering about?", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nHer comment comes off not just as differing with you on the topic, but differing with you in your marriage overall. So yes, her family will likely think something of that.\n\nBut your response was unnecessary and rude.  If there are real problems here with her changing attitudes over the years, then address that issue at home and not at family Thanksgiving.  \n\nYou should have stuck with something more neutral that stuck to the topic at hand, maybe \"I guess we'll have to agree to disagree today\" or some nonsense.", "YTA. You know politics is a subject that is likely to cause debate with her family, so what did you expect when you decided to engage her father in a political discussion? You should have shut down the conversation before it started and switched to a new topic. Then once the argument started, if you couldn't honor your agreement to be supportive of your wife, the least you could have done is just stay out of the fight.\n\nHer comment was a bit over the line, but your response was condescending as hell and was fully intended to be dismissive of her right to have an opinion.", "> Let me just say, I am of the opinion that even if you\u2019re right about something, you can be wrong about how you come off to others about it. And if you can\u2019t be nice when you speak, then don\u2019t speak at all. It\u2019s just the way I was raised. \n\nYTA. Politeness culture is structured in a way so that the victims will always seem rude, and the abusers can say the nastiest things in the most polite ways. I've had plenty of conversations where people talk about how I should never have existed, and I'm treated as the rude one for objecting. No one should be forced to set their emotions aside just so an abuser can joyfully abuse people.\n\nBeing calm and polite and unaffected by human rights issues is a privilege.", ">I don\u2019t strictly disagree with what she said, but in the back and forth banter of it all, she said, verbatim \u201cOh that\u2019s right, I forgot, you\u2019re always right about everything.\u201d \n\nThat's pretty mild, and you don't seem to be interested in sharing any of your specific behavior, hiding it under \"back and forth banter\".\n\n>Now, my wife and I have an agreement about presenting a united front, particularly in front of her folks\n\nSo why didn't you back up your wife?

Because if it's all very well to present a united front if you're disagreeing about wine or even the education budget, it's different if it's something like should we let women decide what they want to do with their bodies.

That will come back to bite you in a certain place later, and what did you both achieve from it in the moment? Not a lot, I should think.", "In family get-togethers ignore politics and anyone that talks about it and hope the conversation about it dies off, it's always a mine-field.\n\nThese days talking to a single person one-on-one about political stuff is honest conversation, anymore than that and you got a 50/50 chance of being lynched by a mob, something to remember.", "ESH.  Seems like you'all have some communicating to do in your marriage before taking your show on the road.  Good luck to you.", "ESH - you for getting into a topic with the in laws that is well known to create bad feelings at thanksgiving and her for escalating it into a conflict between the two of you.    Your in laws obviously are also for the racism and gamesmanship.\n\nYou knew this was a trap and you jumped into it and pulled her in.   She chose you over them.  This is probably more on you than her and you should feel guilty about it and apologize.", "Info: was she disagreeing with you or her dad? If you, esa a little. If her dad, yta. Wither way you need to discuss what's on your mind about her views. You say she's more \"militant\" about feminism since your daughter was born but you realize there are lots of policies that will hurt your daughter being enacted right now? Roe being overturned could harm her. The continued assault on bc and female bodily autonomy is a major issue. Also are your friends misogynist? Because her making \"snide comments about men\" when your friends are over seems like it's in reaction to thier behavior or language. You kind of seem like you don't really support her views as much as you'd like to believe. Also, disagreeing on politics is never going to be polite when politics encompasses discussions about whether people have human rights. You seem to be in a privileged position since you aren't upset about the topics she's concerned about. I'm leaning YTA. Not only for \"calling (your) wife out on her BS\" - to me it seems like you wanted to put her in her place for not responding like you would - but for your attitude towards her generally.", "YTA.\n\nBeing superficially polite to people who don't think you deserve dignity and happiness is a stupid waste of time, I'm sorry, but it is. If that's something you want to subject *yourself* to, I guess that's your prerogative. \n\nBut I think your wife becoming \"more militant\" after the birth of your daughter is a sign that she's taking the responsibilities of parenthood more seriously than you are. You aren't just making this decision to turn the other cheek for yourselves anymore. Your wife understands that she has a child who can't defend themselves, a biracial girl, to protect. Maybe she's not doing it productively or thought through her approach, but becoming less tolerant of intolerance is a good sign.\n\nWomen who are taught to be pleasant and accommodating to people who don't respect them get hurt or killed. You and your wife need to discuss what you are going to do to model self-respect as a value for your daughter. It's much more important than meaningless niceties with your in-laws.", "Nta but from everything you said it sounds like something else is very wrong here. I would talk to her about what is actually bothering her because this clearly did not come out of the blue like you think it did.", "NTA because she can\u2019t expect a united front when having just thrown a verbal dagger at you. This is why I stopped having political conversations with my family, because it just gets so nasty sometimes. I have literally walked away from conversations because I figure I shouldn\u2019t start with \u201clook, m***f***ker.\u201d However, I understand why your wife is upset because right now, in the United States, women\u2019s rights are being cranked back to even worse than before Roe v. Wade. There are trigger laws that went into effect when the Supreme Court undid that ruling. She is likely (and rightfully) terrified that her next pregnancy could have something wrong with it, that\u2019s life threatening to her and she would be powerless to choose (depending on where you live). So please understand where her anger is coming from. Was the birth of your child a difficult one? Try to look at this from her perspective.", "This is definitely one of the times where justified asshole would be a good option. ESH though, while she was in the wrong about how she spoke to you, your response made the situation worse.\n\nI can't say I wouldn't have responded any different though.", "NTA, but my logic for you not being the asshole goes against your own ethical philosophy wherein one can be wrong for saying something right in the wrong way. \n\nMy logic is that your wife did say something hurtful to you, and you correctly pointed out that she did. You\u2019re not wrong AND she started it. To my mind both of those things together make you not the asshole. Plus it\u2019s not like you did the same thing to her that she did to you; you called her out for being a dick and making you feel bad. She said something bitingly sarcastic which not only undermined your opinion and was reductive of you as a person; but also it misrepresented you which, coming from your wife of 5 years really hurts because she\u2019s supposed to be the one person in the world who truly and deeply knows you more than anyone. It feels lonely and disheartening to be made to wonder if that\u2019s what she really thinks of you. Of course there could also be a communication issue because she could have just been trying to make a joke, who knows.\n\nAnyway she kind of emotionally painted you into a corner whether she meant to or not and even if you shouldn\u2019t have called her out right then and there in front of the family, I am still not prepared to call you an asshole for it because not being able to fully keep your cool in that situation is reasonable. It\u2019s not like you flew off the handle.", "NTA. I think the comment you made that preceded her sarcastic remark was a **very necessary** interjection in her narrative. I\u2019m guessing she was embarrassed that she was so short-sighted and reacted out of her embarrassment instead of taking a moment to realize her mistake and acknowledging that. I hope she has the decency to apologize to you when she has time to process the conversation.", "What's wrong with people? Why do they gotta talk about politics during a family holiday that's intended to bring people together?\n\nI've long accepted that other folks have different opinions on things and that those opinions may not be always be in line with what I believe. \n\nBecause both politics and religion are very important to me and I know I can get heated about it, I simply don't discuss it with other people if I am unsure of their stance or know that it may lead to a heated discussion. \n\nI am a socialist and a democrat, my brother in law is a hardcore republican. We still managed to get through Thanksgiving without a fight, had a blast playing Mario Kart with him. \n\nESH", "Methinks the Iranian yoghurt is not the issue", "NTA - It's maybe not the best thing to do, but I'm not surprised by your response. In the heat of the moment, it could have been much worse.", "ESH. No political or religious discussions at the table man.", "NTA.  Craig Fergusen has this to say on the subject:  \"Does this need to be said?  Does it need to be said by me?  Does it need to be said now?\"  Her making snide remarks about men in front of men is rude and disrespectful.  Obviously all men are not a problem as she chose to marry you and have a child.
