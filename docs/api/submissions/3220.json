{"id": 3220, "submission_id": "z4grjk", "title": "AITA for calling my wife out on her BS during Thanksgiving dinner with her side of the family?", "selftext": "My wife (29f) and I (29m) have been married almost 5 years now. Since our daughter\u2019s been born, she\u2019s become\u2026 let\u2019s say more militant\u2026 about feminism and women\u2019s rights than she has in the past. I 100% support her in her endeavors but sometimes it can be a bit, especially when she makes snide comments about men whenever my friends are over. \n\nYesterday, during Thanksgiving dinner with her family (who, let me say are extraordinarily conservative and were against us being together as we\u2019re an interracial couple), her dad and I were discussing politics and, while I don\u2019t agree with everything that he thinks about our nation\u2019s polity, he made some interesting points that I thought were more in line with my/our views. The gloves came off, my fellow potential a-holes. \n\nLet me just say, I am of the opinion that even if you\u2019re right about something, you can be wrong about how you come off to others about it. And if you can\u2019t be nice when you speak, then don\u2019t speak at all. It\u2019s just the way I was raised. \n\nI don\u2019t strictly disagree with what she said, but in the back and forth banter of it all, she said, verbatim \u201cOh that\u2019s right, I forgot, you\u2019re always right about everything.\u201d Read all the sarcasm that there is folks. Now, my wife and I have an agreement about presenting a united front, particularly in front of her folks, because they\u2019re the sort of people that will use any conversation had with them as ammunition against you in a later conversation. So I was very taken aback by that statement as 1) I\u2019m not passive, but I\u2019m sure as heck not the person that has to be right all the time and 2) shock factor that we\u2019re going to have to deal with her folks about that statement later at some point.  \n\nI admit, my response may be a-hole worthy. I calmly said back to her \u201cBabe, you can be right about whatever it is we\u2019re talking about and not be a smartass about it in front of your family.\u201d \n\nLong story short, she\u2019s not talking to me at the moment. I don\u2019t feel guilty per se except that maybe I threw more fuel on the flame with her family, but what do you guys think. AITA?\n\nEdit: Grammar\n\nINFO update:  (I don\u2019t know if I should respond to individual comments or not, so I thought I\u2019d post responses up here, sorry if it\u2019s wrong!) A couple of people have asked what we were discussing beforehand. My FIL and I were discussing fiscal responsibility and the state of the welfare program in the U.S. Politics and religion are major conversation points for FIL and I and we bonded over being able to have differing perspectives and having good dialogue despite the fact. Thanksgiving is typically full of political talk - has been for the past four years. My wife made a comment about men not seeing things correctly because we\u2019ve run the country for the past four centuries and I said something to the effect of \u201cthat\u2019s not fair or right concerning me because as a black man that statement isn\u2019t true.\u201d To which she responded as the story above goes.\n\nINFO: To address the health of our marriage. Literally, this sort of thing (this situation) is so uncommon that it was legitimately baffling to me why people were bringing up our marriage. My wife and I love each other very much and our daughter and her future is priority one for us outside of the health of our marriage.", "created_utc": 1669391847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4grjk/aita_for_calling_my_wife_out_on_her_bs_during/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Politeness culture is structured in a way so that the victims will always seem rude, and the abusers can say the nastiest things in the most polite ways. I've had plenty of conversations where people talk about how I should never have existed, and I'm treated as the rude one for objecting. No one should be forced to set their emotions aside just so an abuser can joyfully abuse people.\n\nBeing calm and polite and unaffected by human rights issues is a privilege.", ">I don\u2019t strictly disagree with what she said, but in the back and forth banter of it all, she said, verbatim \u201cOh that\u2019s right, I forgot, you\u2019re always right about everything.\u201d \n\nThat's pretty mild, and you don't seem to be interested in sharing any of your specific behavior, hiding it under \"back and forth banter\".\n\n>Now, my wife and I have an agreement about presenting a united front, particularly in front of her folks\n\nSo why didn't you back up your wife?

Your in laws obviously are also for the racism and gamesmanship.\n\nYou knew this was a trap and you jumped into it and pulled her in.   She chose you over them.  This is probably more on you than her and you should feel guilty about it and apologize.", "Info: was she disagreeing with you or her dad? If you, esa a little. If her dad, yta. Wither way you need to discuss what's on your mind about her views. You say she's more \"militant\" about feminism since your daughter was born but you realize there are lots of policies that will hurt your daughter being enacted right now? Roe being overturned could harm her. The continued assault on bc and female bodily autonomy is a major issue. Also are your friends misogynist? Because her making \"snide comments about men\" when your friends are over seems like it's in reaction to thier behavior or language. You kind of seem like you don't really support her views as much as you'd like to believe. Also, disagreeing on politics is never going to be polite when politics encompasses discussions about whether people have human rights. You seem to be in a privileged position since you aren't upset about the topics she's concerned about. I'm leaning YTA. Not only for \"calling (your) wife out on her BS\" - to me it seems like you wanted to put her in her place for not responding like you would - but for your attitude towards her generally.", "YTA.\n\nBeing superficially polite to people who don't think you deserve dignity and happiness is a stupid waste of time, I'm sorry, but it is. If that's something you want to subject *yourself* to, I guess that's your prerogative. \n\nBut I think your wife becoming \"more militant\" after the birth of your daughter is a sign that she's taking the responsibilities of parenthood more seriously than you are. You aren't just making this decision to turn the other cheek for yourselves anymore. Your wife understands that she has a child who can't defend themselves, a biracial girl, to protect. Maybe she's not doing it productively or thought through her approach, but becoming less tolerant of intolerance is a good sign.\n\nWomen who are taught to be pleasant and accommodating to people who don't respect them get hurt or killed. You and your wife need to discuss what you are going to do to model self-respect as a value for your daughter. It's much more important than meaningless niceties with your in-laws.", "Nta but from everything you said it sounds like something else is very wrong here. I would talk to her about what is actually bothering her because this clearly did not come out of the blue like you think it did.", "NTA because she can\u2019t expect a united front when having just thrown a verbal dagger at you. This is why I stopped having political conversations with my family, because it just gets so nasty sometimes. I have literally walked away from conversations because I figure I shouldn\u2019t start with \u201clook, m***f***ker.\u201d However, I understand why your wife is upset because right now, in the United States, women\u2019s rights are being cranked back to even worse than before Roe v. Wade. There are trigger laws that went into effect when the Supreme Court undid that ruling. She is likely (and rightfully) terrified that her next pregnancy could have something wrong with it, that\u2019s life threatening to her and she would be powerless to choose (depending on where you live). So please understand where her anger is coming from. Was the birth of your child a difficult one? Try to look at this from her perspective.", "This is definitely one of the times where justified asshole would be a good option. ESH though, while she was in the wrong about how she spoke to you, your response made the situation worse.\n\nI can't say I wouldn't have responded any different though.", "NTA, but my logic for you not being the asshole goes against your own ethical philosophy wherein one can be wrong for saying something right in the wrong way. \n\nMy logic is that your wife did say something hurtful to you, and you correctly pointed out that she did. You\u2019re not wrong AND she started it. To my mind both of those things together make you not the asshole. Plus it\u2019s not like you did the same thing to her that she did to you; you called her out for being a dick and making you feel bad. She said something bitingly sarcastic which not only undermined your opinion and was reductive of you as a person; but also it misrepresented you which, coming from your wife of 5 years really hurts because she\u2019s supposed to be the one person in the world who truly and deeply knows you more than anyone. It feels lonely and disheartening to be made to wonder if that\u2019s what she really thinks of you. Of course there could also be a communication issue because she could have just been trying to make a joke, who knows.\n\nAnyway she kind of emotionally painted you into a corner whether she meant to or not and even if you shouldn\u2019t have called her out right then and there in front of the family, I am still not prepared to call you an asshole for it because not being able to fully keep your cool in that situation is reasonable. It\u2019s not like you flew off the handle.", "NTA. I think the comment you made that preceded her sarcastic remark was a **very necessary** interjection in her narrative. I\u2019m guessing she was embarrassed that she was so short-sighted and reacted out of her embarrassment instead of taking a moment to realize her mistake and acknowledging that. I hope she has the decency to apologize to you when she has time to process the conversation.", "What's wrong with people? Why do they gotta talk about politics during a family holiday that's intended to bring people together?\n\nI've long accepted that other folks have different opinions on things and that those opinions may not be always be in line with what I believe. \n\nBecause both politics and religion are very important to me and I know I can get heated about it, I simply don't discuss it with other people if I am unsure of their stance or know that it may lead to a heated discussion. \n\nI am a socialist and a democrat, my brother in law is a hardcore republican. We still managed to get through Thanksgiving without a fight, had a blast playing Mario Kart with him. \n\nESH", "Methinks the Iranian yoghurt is not the issue", "NTA - It's maybe not the best thing to do, but I'm not surprised by your response. In the heat of the moment, it could have been much worse.", "ESH. No political or religious discussions at the table man.", "NTA.  Craig Fergusen has this to say on the subject:  \"Does this need to be said?  Does it need to be said by me?  Does it need to be said now?\"  Her making snide remarks about men in front of men is rude and disrespectful.  Obviously all men are not a problem as she chose to marry you and have a child.

I feel like you should get to the bottom of that and really understand it. The comment your wife made isn\u2019t one that is prompted by a brief disagreement. That comments is months or years of frustration and other negative emotions. I highly suspect your understanding if your marriage as generally healthy isn\u2019t shared by your wife.", "YTA. I get why your wife is really passionate now that she has a daughter. Because womens rights don\u2019t just affect her it affects her daughter. She is literally fighting for your daughter. Let her fight, because the world is trying to take your daughters rights away from her( yea your family is a part of the problem). As someone who grew up with grandparents that resented I was not  born a boy, the fact my mom fought  as  hard as she did for me was my saving grace. Do not yell at your wife for fighting for your daughter, tell her to fight harder. Just because their family doesn\u2019t mean they are not part of the problem. Sounds like you need to put boundaries with your parents. My parents got divorced because my dad didn\u2019t. My step mom changed him and now he doesn\u2019t talk to his parents anymore. You have a daughter now and you really need to think if having your family in her life is more damaging than good. My mom divorced my dad for a lot of reasons but the nail in the coffin is when his parents told me I was a waste of money for tutoring because I didn\u2019t need to be smart that wasn\u2019t my purpose. Do you have any idea how that fucked me up? Side with your daughter before your parents. Your wife and your daughter  are your first priority and your not acting like it therefore YTA", "She said men had run the country into the ground for the last 400 years. OP is a black man and should rightly push back on that point but she stood on it", "Yup. I have absolutely become infinitely more angry about gender inequality since having two daughters. \n\nI have learned to navigate the world, and for myself when faced with frequent misogyny I just shrug most of the time. However, the idea of my tiny girls being subjected to same crap as they get older that I have? It makes me rage.", "Additionally, OP's perspective that his wife is becoming \"more militant\" seems completely blind to the fact that misogyny is on the rise - perhaps he's frequently missing why his wife is becoming pissed off?\n\nYTA OP, I think you don't spend enough time understanding your wife's perspective and are just ignoring her as \"just another militant feminist\".", "This is a big assumption y\u2019all don\u2019t know what the situations or conversations was about and nobody in this situation was being abused she said something rude (sarcasm is fucking rude) he said something rude theirs no victim in this situation", "Victims and abusers?

I\u2019m missing a nuance!", "There was a point in time when politics was a perfectly fine topic of conversation and did NOT result in war around the dinner table.  If OP and his FIL are capable of having a polite discussion/debate that both enjoy then let them enjoy themselves.", "You never talk politics on thanksgiving?

YTA", "That\u2019s simply untrue and at this point \u201cwe used to talk about politics without it being a problem\u201d is basically just a thought terminating cliche. Politics has always been a point of contention within families and at the dinner tables for ever and in every country.", "Uh huh, \"people taking advantage of Welfare programs\" sounds a lot like you were bitching about single moms and their families, which is what the majority of Welfare recipients are. Your FIL was being classist. Of course your wife sees it as more personal. \n\nYTA.", "Y\u2019all just like to assume stuff not everybody on welfare have to have kids or are single moms my family was on welfare  and I had both parents in my lost most people in the city I lived in had welfare even though they were to parent households", "Going to point you to my previous post where I specified that *the majority* are households with single moms, obviously not all are.

We would never read them aloud to each other. We would respect each other's comfort over our own enjoyment. He could have had a conversation with his FIL in private, through phones, if nothing else.\n\nYour memory differs from mine. \"No politics or religion\" was a oft repeated until very recently. The only time I heard about politics growing up, was when we were not in mixed company (or they thought they weren't). In the workplaces around here, it's still a rule not to discuss such things. This trend of bringing up the most emotional topic possible is very, very recent. And make no mistake- politics involves both human rights and their lives. When such things are at stake, it is an emotional topic. At dinner, we aren't running a debate squad. This isn't hypothetical or meant to be a properly run debate, able to be moderated and fact checked and put down when necessary. This is eating food and trying to enjoy each other's company.

I do not agree with OP at all and am not backtracking. Let me say it a different way, with examples:\n\n1. Politeness says I can't be honest when I don't like something. I have to make excuses and lie. Say I don't like spinach, and am offered spinach. \"Oh, I couldn't eat another bite\" is polite, \"I don't care for spinach\" is impolite.\n2. Respectfulness says I can be honest, but I shouldn't be a dick about it. \"I don't like spinach\" is respectful, \"how dare you serve me spinach you fucker\" is disrespectful.\n3. \"I'd rather not hug you\" is impolite, hugging them or pretending I'm sick is polite.\n4. \"I don't like to hug people\" is respectful, \"fuck off you creep\" is disrespectful.\n5. \"You're a jerk\" is impolite, \"I'd rather discuss something else\" is polite.\n6. \"I don't like the way you're acting\" is respectful, \"fuck off\" is only respectful if the person pushed you far enough.\n\nSee the difference? Politeness is about following the rules and sacrificing your own boundaries to make others feel better. Respect is about honesty, boundaries, and not going out of your way to make others feel bad.\n\n> Why would you agree that he treated her like a child? The tone?

Anyone can say \u201cyou\u2019re going out of your way to be a Dick\u201d to discredit any argument, which is literally the politeness culture that you\u2019re decrying in the original comment - deflecting from the actual issue to instead discuss the *way* you said\n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways.
