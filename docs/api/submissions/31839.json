{"id": 31839, "submission_id": "184vf49", "title": "AITA for not sitting with my dad at my mom's funeral?", "selftext": "I (19m) recently lost my mom to cancer. Her funeral was a week ago. For some background info, my parents divorced ten years ago. My dad wasn't a good guy. He cheated on my mom multiple times during their marriage. He was never there for me. When I was 14, my dad reached out to me. He remarried and I met his wife, 'Rebecca', and her 2 kids 'Sammy' (now 16m) and 'Katie' (now 15f). My mom had full custody of me up until that point but my dad decided to fight for 50/50 custody because his wife needed someone to watch her kids and money was tight for them. For 4 years I was their free babysitter 2 weeks out of every month and they would ground me if I refused to help during my weeks with my mom. I spent a lot of my time grounded at their house which made me absolutely hate him and his family.   \nMy mom was diagnosed with cancer when I was 17. She came from money but cancer's a bitch and what she had wasn't enough. I got a job and tried pitching in as much as I could. This bothered my dad as he had been in a tough financial situation for years and I never contributed. A month before I turned 18, I told my school counselor that my dad and his wife were treating me badly. I had lied because they were keeping me from seeing or calling my mom when it was my dad's time and I was getting frustrated. Their home was investigated my dad's kids were talked to and obviously, nothing was found. I got grounded and my stuff was taken away because as my dad put it \"I had embarrassed him and accused him of not taking care of me.\" On my 18th birthday, I left. I've ignored my dad's calls and cut out his family. I was never close with his other kids so it didn't really bother me.  \nThis last year my mom got worse. I watched her suffer through her last months. I hated that I couldn't do anything. At her funeral, I sat with my best friend, Nick (19m). My dad was invited by some extended family and I didn't even know. After the service was over I got berated by my dad for not sitting with my family and not acknowledging him or his family in my speech. His wife was offended that I said that my mom was someone who could never be replaced and how she was always there for me. My dad said that his wife had tried for years to bond with me and I never cared about her feelings. He said his kids were upset when I walked out of their lives and how I hurt them because I never cared for them. I told him that he was being a hypocrite since I recalled him doing the same thing to me when I was a kid. The fight escalated and he said that he tried to change and I got tired of his bs. He began insulting my mom, so I told him to leave. When he refused, I cried until some family took him outside. My dad and even my mom's side of the family have been telling me that I acted immaturely and it made my dad look bad that his son didn't sit with him. I believe that he had no right to expect me to care about him.

Your dad could have avoided looking bad by being a half-decent father to you, but since he couldn't do that he is reaping what he sowed.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. For the loss of your loving mother, and for the waste of space that is your biological father. You're allowed to feel what you feel, and relatives who criticized you, care more for public perception than for you, or your perfectly righteous anger towards your deadbeat dad and his clingy other family. They're probably thinking you can give their family money now.", "I am sorry for your loss!\n\nIn regards of your father and his new family:\nYou done all things right, king. \n\nNTA", "NTA oh my heart im so sorry", "Yes, this exactly. My dad cheated on my mom as well, but it definitely affected me and my sister. He was barely around and when he was he just picked fights and screamed at me or my mom. He betrayed my mom, but he essentially abandoned us for the women he cheated with. Anyway OP, NTA and sorry you had to deal with that bs on one of the worst days of your life.", "Nta\n\nThey grounded you for wanting to be with your mom during her custody time? The fuck? How self centered do you have to be?", "Mom's side of the family are on \"dads\" side. I'm betting that those people were not there helping him and his mom when they needed it the most! They don't have the right to an opinion on how he handles anything!!! \n\nOP, you are entitled to feel how you feel and don't let anyone tell you differently!\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. Huge soft hugs and healing juju flying your way!", "NTA. You dad was a massive AH - you just lost your mother and he chose to make her funeral all about him.\n\nhope that sitting with your friend meant that you felt supported and comforted during the funeral.\n\nYou didn't owe him or his family any acknowledgment - the day was about your mom, so even of what he said about his wife was accurate, it had no place in tour Mom's eulogy. She was your Mom and she can't be replaced (and a decent step parent wouldn't be trying to replace her, they would be widening the number of people you have who love and care about you)\n\nI'm sorry that you have members of your family who were so insensitive.\n\nAlso - until he made an issue of it, it's likely that people would have assumed he attended to pay his respects and to be there for you if you wanted him. He chose to make it all about himself and it's very sad that your family are more concerned  about his feelings than yours..\n\nI am very sorry for your loss.", "NTA. That's infuriating.  F your dad sideways with a cactus. And those family members giving you crap, too.", "NTA. And after he way your dad behaved towards your mum, he had no right to even be at her funeral.", "NTA", "NTA - I can\u2019t believe your family is treating you this way. I\u2019m so sorry- create a new life for yourself. Also email your dad telling him everything you resent him for and copy the family. He is obviously telling them something different.", "Your father made himself look bad by being an asshole - and that's an understatement.\n\nWhy would you care about him ?This was about your mother anyway. Not him or his family. \n\nYour father is a selfish user. You are free to keep him cut out. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Im very sorry for your loss. I would have looked him in the eye and said \u201cwho are you\u201d and walked away. F that noise.", "I don't think it was right of you to make claims to the school counsellor that disparaged your father, particularly because of the impact that could have on his second wife and HER children, but I understand why you did it and kids can't necessarily fully comprehend the consequences of their actions. You would have been better off simply leaving to see your sick mother, regardless of whether your dad approved of it or not. \n\nOther than that, I think you are 100% right. How dare he try to guilt-trip you as if his second wife and step-children or their feelings are supposed to be your concern. \n\nI hope you told him plainly that when he chose to abandon your mother and you he also abandoned any right to demand anything from you. Ever. He should be glad that you even took the time of day to acknowledge his existence at all by even responding to his outburst.", "NTA in the least. NC forever, honestly... he had some cojones showing up to his ex-wife's funeral after the way he treated her, and you.\n\nGo live the best life your mom wanted for you. I'm very sorry for your loss.", "Shame you didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t tell your dad that you sat with your family because he is no longer your family. He went out and found a person to replace your mom and you. He found someone with kids that he felt were more worthy of his affection. He can go to hell and tell him explicitly you won\u2019t be attending his funeral.", "NTA.\n\nOP, I am sincerely sorry for the loss of your mom. \n\nYou owe your father absolutely nothing. Not even another thought. Please seek grief counseling and lean on those who truly support you. The talking heads in your mom's family who cared about the optics of your not sitting with him don't count. I wish you peace and happiness.", "NTA.  Stay as far away from your father.  Sorry for your loss.  Stay strong and continue to find strength and support from friends and adults you can trust.", "NTA, that\u2019s just how slimy ah\u2019s like your dad are. They attack their grieving daughter at her mom\u2019s funeral and berate her to they point where the funeral is no longer about the mom who passed and is instead about \u201cthem\u201d. Do not engage with these people, do not give them the reaction. Block and remove these toxic people from your life.", " Nta!", "NTA and I am so sorry for your loss", "What's worse is that this AH wasn't even trying for full custody out of love but because his AH wife needed a babysitter."]}
