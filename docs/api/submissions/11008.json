You probably don\u2019t want a string bikini for volleyball or wakeboarding. It\u2019s a lot of movement and knots can come undone. A sportier style might be better for activity days.\n\nBut, if everyone is going out on a boat, swimming, catching sun\u2026no worries on the revealing one. She won\u2019t be at risk of a wardrobe malfunction in that. So I\u2019d just make sure she\u2019s comfortable with her purchases while she keeps in mind what she\u2019ll be doing. I love tiny sexy bikinis but sometimes they\u2019re made more for being admired than for being active haha", "NAH you\u2019re not forcing her to wear something else, you just suggested she have additional options. But she\u2019s old enough to be in charge of what she wears. While I understand the urge to be protective, people will sexualize women and girls no matter what they wear, so she might as well wear what\u2019s comfortable for her & makes her feel confident.", "You sound like a good mom with great intentions. I recommend feeling language. \nSomething like,  they look great on her, you would personally feel a little exposed in them and you think it would be a good idea for her to have another option in case she does end up feeling uncomfortable or she wants to do more active water activities, but it's her decision.", "Right now you're NAH but don't push the issue. Bathing suits are revealing, that's just the nature of them. Unless they're completely mesh or fishnet and show off all her nips and bits, I'm sure the bikinis are harmless. \n\nThere will be plenty of other gals in revealing swimsuits on the beach, your daughter will blend right in.", "NAH. Not an asshole.  You're just asking. It's possible that you're being conservative about it but you're not forcing her to do anything.", "NAH. She asked for your opinion.", "I\u2019d let this go.  If it were my kid I\u2019d remind her that she might also want a rash guard for ocean swimming and reducing the chance of sunburn, but a t shirt will work just as well.", "NAH. \n\nWomen are going to get sexualized no matter what we wear. A 17 year old in a bikini isn\u2019t the problem, weirdo adults who sexualize them are the problem. \n\nI agree with the other commenters about the outfit matching the activity. I personally love to wear a tiny string bikini when I\u2019m hanging at the pool! As a plus size woman, I used to feel the need to wear full coverage swimsuits with \u2018smoothing\u2019 panels in them that sucked me in and were horribly uncomfortable and made me feel self conscious\u2026 until I took a trip to Mexico at 25 and met a woman who was probably a size 20, and was absolutely crushing it in a tiny bikini. Now I find it really empowering to wear little bikinis at the pool, but for any kind of ocean activity, snorkeling, paddle boarding, etc, I wear a full body dive skin. (Basically looks like a scuba suit but it\u2019s made from thin swimsuit material.) It protects me from jellyfish, sunburns, I don\u2019t need to wear sunscreen, don\u2019t need to worry about accidentally flashing the entire beach, etc. \n\nI\u2019d recommend just talking to your daughter about bringing a more covering swimsuit that she can do activities in comfortably, in addition to the bikinis she chose, and maybe also use this as an opening to have a conversation about consent, body autonomy, how to respond if people touch or comment on her body in ways she doesn\u2019t like, etc.", "NTA. Like someone else said, you\u2019re clearly coming from a place of care. \u201cFighting it\u201d is probably not the best plan of attack here because it will just create resentment. But maybe it\u2019s an opportunity for a good mother-daughter talk, let her know that you weren\u2019t trying to shame her, but that you know what it\u2019s like to feel pressured to dress provocatively and just wanted to make sure she was doing this for her, not the eyes of other people.\n\nMost importantly, enjoy your vacation! As a mom of two teens, I\u2019m sure you need it!", "NTA.\n\n1. She voluntarily sent you pictures to find out your opinion about the bikinis. You did not force her to. You would have been the AH in case you had forced her.\n\n2. You gave her your opinions. You didn't shame her. And it's okay for her to say no if she doesn't want to shop for more options with you.\n\n3. You wanting to shop for more options does not mean that you have poor taste. Who knows, she might even like the ones you buy.", "NAH, just request your daughter bring a conservative choice in case she needs it, ie for snorkeling etc, losing your swim top is a real thing.  Help her find a cute sarong or swimsuit coverup so she can easily go from beach to bistro.  Without prompting, your daughter might end up choosing the more conservative bikinis.", "NTA because you are obviously coming from a place of love. But you should probably choose not to fight this battle. You won't win.", "NAH and it's common for that age to wear bikinis :)", "NTA because your her mother and she's your daughter  However your daughter is 17 and will be an adult soon so it's really not worth ruining a family vacation because she'll be wearing the same bikinis that 80 year old women will be wearing at the beach. Two days at the beach in Florida desensitized me to bikinis and who should wear them and how they look for life.", "NTA. You would be if you were shaming her, but you're not. \n\nOptions are great to have, especially if you'll be by the ocean! More coverage = less burn/less sunscreen and more comfort in heavy surf. Much easier to enjoy a nice snorkel or surf without worrying about straps!", "Is it a taste or a moral issue?", "Nah based on your comments it seems to be a modesty issue. So will your husband and son also be wearing modest bathing trunks and covering their chests?  \n\nYou aren't the ahole bc you aren't telling her *not* to buy them and take them, but to buy multiple options just in case.", "NTA but let her wear the bikini she wants. I hope you guys have a great vacation.", "INFO\n\nWhat exactly are you objecting to? What is acceptable vs unacceptable? \"Eye popping\" is not a clear, actionable boundary. So at minimum you need to actually explain what you expect from her.", "NAH. I\u2019m a teen mom too. And I get it. It\u2019s hard knowing the kind of attention they\u2019ll get. We as adults know how gross men are and want them far away from our babies. BUT we can\u2019t punish them because men haven\u2019t evolved since the age of the caveman. It\u2019s more important that our daughters trust us, and feel safe being themselves with us. I let my teen wear what she wants, our relationship is too important to let something like that make her trust me less. \n\nMaybe talk with her about men. Make sure she knows what to do if she encounters harassment or any unwanted attention.", "INFO.\n\nIf you said she could keep them, then you're not necessarily objecting to her wearing them. So what's the issue here? Is it something to do with this specific trip? What are we missing here?", "The only real difference between a bikini and a one piece are that your back and stomach are bare. \n\nMen\u2019s swimsuits always have their backs and stomachs bare, they are never covered. \n\nSo it\u2019s weird we have an issue with female stomachs but not male stomachs.", "NTA- there\u2019s a lot of people in the sub who seem to believe that 17-year-old girls are fully adults and should be allowed to do whatever they want including wearing whatever they want. They also believe that if you don\u2019t want your child to be wearing revealing clothing then that means you\u2019re sexualizing them and you\u2019re horrible. But that\u2019s not true, you\u2019re just a mother trying to make sure your daughter dress appropriately and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with trying to make sure your daughter doesn\u2019t have any sort of wardrobe malfunction.", "She 17 she going to wear clothe you don't always approve off", "Let it go. She\u2019s 17 in another you won\u2019t get a voice. She still asks your input - you won\u2019t in a year if you walk back what you ok\u2019d this time. YTA", "I am brazilian, we always use really small swimsuit over here, evebody does, and to be fair i dont see a problem if she is comfortable with it.", "INFO: are the suits she sent you out of character for her? Is she typically a girl who is very comfortable with her body? My thought is that her friends may have talked her into something she's actually not comfortable in and was looking for a parental \"absolutely not!\" so she could blame you for the \"no.\" It sounds like that isn't the case, but I wanted to throw it out there as an option. \n\nOtherwise, I agree with the comments asking about your activities...if you're going to be super active, you might suggest a sports bra style as well, in addition to the bikinis, which would give her options while on the trip. And maybe some really cute cover-ups.", "She might get more attention than she is comfortable with from Mexican males, who can be quite vocal about their views. Might want to cover up a bit for her own comfort.", "my almost 20 year old knows if her bath suit is inappropriate for a family vacation don\u2019t pack it. if i\u2019m footing the bill it needs to be family friendly. i will take it and not give back", "NTA.\nIt's a family holiday, paid for by you.

I can put them on over my swimsuit if I want to do something that needs more coverage or if I just want to be wearing more, and they're lightweight and dry fast, so they can fit easily in a beach bag. Some of them are full zip, too, so I can decide how much skin I'm showing.\n\n\nI'm a 34G (UK size because I buy mostly Italian and German bras, idk what the us conversion is) and was even as a very young teenager. \n\ncreeps were creeps regardless of what I was wearing, and having people tell me to dress for myself was incredibly helpful for me to be comfortable in my own skin. \n\nBecause of my comically giant boobs, bikinis are actually more comfortable for me because one pieces and tankinis either crush my chest or have a stupid amount of loose fabric around the waist. \n\nLong sleeved rash guards are the perfect solution for me.", "NAH. The only place I think you may have gone wrong is offering to go shopping with her for different suits, instead of suggesting that she should look for some additional suits by herself. It sounds like she was fine getting a second opinion on suits she had already picked first. She just didn't want you to pick with/for her.", "NAH. I get where you both are coming from.

Are you looking specifically for rash guard recommendations or also swim wear for busty gals?", "Info: What kind of bikini bottoms? Are they full coverage or like a thong?", "NAH but good luck! Finding a bikini that is cute without showing too much cheek and not being boy shorts is like finding a unicorn. Two teen daughters here & if the top is cute the bottom is often obscene. It\u2019s rare to find a bikini bottom with full coverage that isn\u2019t a granny bottom. Lately most suits are not just cheeky but super cheeky and wide thongs. It\u2019s even difficult to find something for a young teen at Target!", "While I believe your heart is in the right place, you\u2019re sexualizing your daughter.\n\nI have a daughter and I believe that allowing them to pick hairstyles and clothing at this age is the best way to teach body autonomy. The conversations about what that means are also important.\n\nFor example, in the 5th grade my daughter decided she wanted a blue Mohawk. I know a lot of parents wouldn\u2019t allow it but we discussed how our decisions about our hair are our own. We discussed possible outcomes and ways to deal with them. \n\nThe same is true for clothing. She might get unwanted attention. Prepare her for that.

I might be a bit old fashioned.", "Thank you.", "That\u2019s fair. I think the amount of skin was just a surprise!", "Thanks. I agree with some of what you said, but I don\u2019t think men are bad or gross! They are naturally drawn to beauty. And it\u2019s ok to recognize that a body is attractive.

Omg", "Oh, not this again. \n\nSexy bikinis are sexy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with noticing that. Nobody is sexualizing anyone; the choice to wear something sexy is fine and healthy, but to put some blame/shame on someone for noticing something is sexy is silly.", "Why would being around family make a difference? If anything, being around family should be the time she can be most comfortable because surely her own father and brother aren't sexualizing her, right? \nIf your son decided he wanted to wear a pair of speedos instead of shorts, would you have the same concern?\n\nConcerns about practical aspects of water activities and wearing an appropriate cover up for meals at restaurants are valid things to talk to her about, but it doesn't sound like that's what this is about. \n\nCreepy men are going to sexualize her even if she was wearing a potato sack, so instead of making her feel shame about her own body, let her be free and maybe take this as a great opportunity to talk with her about the ridiculous ways women are blamed and shamed for men's bad behaviour, and what she can do if a guy is ever creepy to her.", "I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not much help there as I\u2019m estranged from my family -the last time they saw me in swimwear, I was a little girl.

You can find a ton of other brands of dive skins that make black suits, but those two make colorful suits, so you can be ~fashionable~ while covering up.", "I totally agree with the sentiments above! You might also want to add to the conversation that if she wants to do any water based activities it might be good to have backup options that offer a bit more security or coverage - make it clear that there is a time and place for different clothing styles and give her the opportunity to decide what works best for her per situation.", "I feel like when it comes to the awkward and messy business of parenting a teenage girl as she, uh\u2026 embraces her body, you can\u2019t find anyone more objective to go to for advice than a gay man in his 30s (me) \ud83d\ude02", "Honestly it is not fair for her to expect that you'll have the \"same taste\" as her.
