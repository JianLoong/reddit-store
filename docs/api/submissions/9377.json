Dad and his GF will be moving away around April-May) They sided with me and said that it's the workers fault and obviously I hadn't know he left screws and wires behind.

It's obvious what actually happened and they should be directing their ire at Sky - not you.  You did nothing wrong and, pushed to your limit with BS, defended yourself against her verbal attack.  They need to sort their shit out.  This is not on you.", "NTA - You did not change the wires, the workers did. She is the parent and it is her job to make sure that the home remains safe for her young child after work like this is done.", "Wait.  Why are you responsible for checking to make sure a company doing repairs, cleaned up their mess?  It's their job.  It's also the child's mother's job to make sure the area is safe for the child once the workers left.  Not you weren't right for screwing at her, but neither was she.", "NTA but while screaming at someone isn't ok, she did start the shit. You just finished it. If she's that unhappy about stuff on the floor she can call the service provider and complain about the installer.", "Nta . You didn\u2019t know they were there . Your dads gf might\u2019ve been looks for a reason to blame you for something .", "NTA.  Someone yells at you unjustifiably and unreasonably, you\u2019re not an asshole to yell back.\n\nI think in this scenario, you\u2019re even more in the clear. If your dad owned the house, and there wasn\u2019t a lease agreement, he would be able to set the conditions for you living there even if you felt those conditions were ridiculous.  (Like if he wanted you to apologize to the GF in this instance.). But since your grandparents own the place and agree with you, you\u2019re completely in the clear.", "NTA. It was accidental. To blame you for that seems unfair. OP, it appears that you have a rocky relationship with her- is there more reasons for her to react the way she did?", "NTA\n\nEven if screaming was not the rigth solution, it's hard to stay calm when you're accused of something you didn't do.", "NTA. it sounds to me like your dads GF is doing everything she can to drive a wedge. My dad dated a woman like that once. She didn\u2019t last long.", "NTA. It's her job to make sure the place is safe for her child. You had nothing to do with it.", "NTA.  I can see a new mom being tired, etc. but she should have apologized.  Of course workman do this, it is to be expected.   Dad and GF should have addressed this with you before the guy came out, saying who can sweep when he is done", "NTA. Not sure how she thinks that this is your fault and not the worker's fault. I would be telling my dad to sort his shit out because he's way off base, and so is his girlfriend.", "NTA. Obviously it's not your fault and being attacked about something you had nothing to do with is extremely frustrating.  I will say perhaps you should not have yelled back and made it personal. You would have been more impactful if you had let her finish flipping out and then made a single point that the worker had done it.  She would have looked stupid.", "Can we talk about how old your dad\u2019s second family is though? This seems weird", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your dad's girlfriend is a piece of work, and I feel sorry for her child. Mark off the days on your calendar until they finally leave.", "She certainly overreacted.", "Nta. But since it\u2019s sky I guess Rupert Murdock is the AH here", "NTA\n\nRegardless of anything, you don\u2019t have to take anybody\u2019s shit and if they\u2019re going to yell at you repeatedly after you\u2019ve tried deescalating, you got every right to stand up for yourself. Both your dad and his gf sound like awful people. Probably why they\u2019re together", "Your both the AH, honestly alittle tact and diplomacy will get you allot farther in life then yelling back at people.\n\nHer brain is probably gone to mush from looking after a baby, cut the girl some slack.\n\nNext time try \"next time ill double check after they leave \" then you can go back to bed. If she is a little bit rational she will feel like an ass after she gets some sleep", "NTA. \n\nLook, she was understandably worried seeing a pretty serious health and safety concern, but that doesn't mean she needed to take it out on you. \n\nDid she think that perhaps you inspected after the workers left? Sure. That's pretty normal to do in those situations to make sure they didn't muck up anything. But again, as you said, the workers left it behind, you did not notice and she is responsible for keeping the kiddo safe. \n\nCould you apologize for name calling? Sure -- and I don't think that's necessarily the worst plan of action to keep the peace, but if you didn't want to, I'd understand that as well.", "ESH. Probably could\u2019ve handled that in a more mature manner. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s concerned for her kid\u2019s safety, but unfair or her to blame you for it. \n\nStill. Probably not best practice to call your dad\u2019s significant other a POS.", "ESH, everybody needs to stop shouting the name calling. As well, everybody just needs to move out of Grandma and Grandpa's house You're all adults, find your own places to live.", "So he is in his forties and she I believe is just over 30. He had me very young.", "OP was woken up by someone yelling at him for something he didn't do and somehow he's the one who's supposed to be rational and diplomatic?", "Absolutely not. Pregnancy/Childbirth/Childcare is not an excuse to act like an asshole. She might have PPD/A and I get it that really sucks but that's an explanation not an excuse. \n\nOP made a mistake, they didn't deserve to get screamed at. And tbh, if you've never lived with a small child you don't always realise how much shit they put in their mouths ALL THE TIME. \n\nCould OP have been a little more diligent in making sure child hazards were cleaned away? Sure! Are they an asshole for not? Absolutely not. \n\nShe should feel bad, she yelled at someone who has nothing to do with it!", "Or calling his grandparents?  Op is 24 not 14. Sheesh. Knowing little ones are in danger can make us crazy.", "totally disagree with apology.", "Apologize for what?", "I mean if the shoe fits", "ESH except your grandparents and your half sister. She sucks for being the parent and not checking the floor, and then passing her guilt off on you. You suck for yelling and swearing. Dad sucks for not backing you up and defusing the situation. Sky sucks for leaving the shit on the ground.", "But OP wasn't at fault at all. He didn't know the repair guy left stuff around. It's the mother's responsibility to ensure the safety of her child. Instead raging at her sleeping step-son, she should have simply removed the screws and went about her day. It's unacceptable to blame someone for her lack of oversight.\n\nNTA OP. It was never your responsibility.", "Not the ass for not checking but getting into a yelling match accomplished nothing and only made his own life more difficult."]}
