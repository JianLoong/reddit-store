I would be telling my dad to sort his shit out because he's way off base, and so is his girlfriend.", "NTA. Obviously it's not your fault and being attacked about something you had nothing to do with is extremely frustrating.  I will say perhaps you should not have yelled back and made it personal.

If she is a little bit rational she will feel like an ass after she gets some sleep", "NTA. \n\nLook, she was understandably worried seeing a pretty serious health and safety concern, but that doesn't mean she needed to take it out on you. \n\nDid she think that perhaps you inspected after the workers left? Sure. That's pretty normal to do in those situations to make sure they didn't muck up anything. But again, as you said, the workers left it behind, you did not notice and she is responsible for keeping the kiddo safe. \n\nCould you apologize for name calling? Sure -- and I don't think that's necessarily the worst plan of action to keep the peace, but if you didn't want to, I'd understand that as well.", "ESH. Probably could\u2019ve handled that in a more mature manner. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s concerned for her kid\u2019s safety, but unfair or her to blame you for it. \n\nStill. Probably not best practice to call your dad\u2019s significant other a POS.", "ESH, everybody needs to stop shouting the name calling.

Absolutely not. \n\nEdit: I agree, OP did not make a mistake!\n\nShe should feel bad, she yelled at someone who has nothing to do with it!", "Or calling his grandparents?  Op is 24 not 14. Sheesh.

GF was probably terrified of the situation and unloaded her emotions in the wrong direction. So while you're totally justified in getting angry, there will probably be plenty of such situations in your life, and being empathetic towards people who act out like that, acting as the defuser, may score you some major life points.

Someone scream at me like that first thing in the morning for something that was not my fault would have received a helluva lot worse than that. Why would she insist you left them out? That's just an odd thing to go on about and there's no way she thought those were actually your screws and your mess. She needs to call the company and yell. She deserves every syllable she heard. I hope the next few months go by quickly so they can get the hell out of there and leave you alone.", "So you were rudely yanked out of a sound sleep by a woman who is not your mother shrieking at you that you deliberately left a booby trap for her toddler?

So it's irrelevant that you didn't know IF you were the adult present or the first adult home you should have checked the area. Not just for a baby but as a general safety precaution. If you were a teen or a young adult I'd say she should check because expecting a person whose brain isn't fully cooked yet to always be responsible is ridiculous but if you were the first on the scene at 24 you should know to do this and have no excuse for not.\n\nThat does give her the right to yell.
