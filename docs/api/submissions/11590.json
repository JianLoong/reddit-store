He said yes. I got him a couple other things and he was super happy. At Xmas he was going to get me this cool sculpture I\u2019ve been wanting (~$70) but ended up not getting it because he couldn\u2019t be bothered to measure/order it. Instead he got me a computer thing (~$120) that I would never use (I was very confused and thought I\u2019d opened someone else\u2019s gift), but I was honest about it and he said he would return it and get me the sculpture. My birthday is a month later and once again he\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019ll get you the sculpture\u201d (even though it was supposed to be my Xmas gift?)\u2026he gets me a T-shirt and a book. After he basically made me spend $700 on him for his bday and he makes more $ than me. He brings up the sculpture again and says he\u2019ll get it for me (so now it\u2019s a birthday gift?) and also says he\u2019ll take me out for a fancy dinner. Neither happened. I asked today if he had ordered the sculpture (a month later) and he got all mad? Basically called me ungrateful and made me feel like I was going to make him broke (but he bought concert tickets tonight for him and his friend that cost more)\u2026AITA? Like I know we shouldn\u2019t \u201cexpect\u201d gifts and stuff, but he\u2019s been promising it to me for months and then to get mad at me when I bring it up? We\u2019ve been together 3 years and it has slowly gone downhill\u2026\n\nUPDATE: I dumped him. I already wanted to but felt as though him not getting me the gift I wanted was a selfish reason and people would think I was a jerk. But you\u2019re right- It\u2019s so much more than that. I appreciate you all for helping me find the courage. Hopefully next time I\u2019ll be able to find it on my own! \ud83e\udef6", "created_utc": 1678062648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jj0l3/aita_my_boyfriend_gave_me_an_iou_but_now_wont/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're right-gifts shouldn't be an expectation in a relationship. But following through on your your word should be.

He used you as a ATM to finance a luxury present for himself. And your friendship circle. That became a default present because he basically stole the money from you. He defaulted on an agreement and then you bought him more stuff.\n\nThen he couldn't be bothered to order your requested present even though you did all the legwork. He got something he probably wanted - did he end up using it as you didn't? And then put minimal effort in for your b'day. But can afford to splash on himself and friends.\n\nYou are a convenience to him. Find someone better. You deserve it.

Getting the sculpture isn\u2019t even about the money anymore but about following up with his promises and hearing you out about wanting it. Sounds very sketchy I would consider breaking up especially since he is spending money on other things like concert tickets.
