He said yes. I got him a couple other things and he was super happy. At Xmas he was going to get me this cool sculpture I\u2019ve been wanting (~$70) but ended up not getting it because he couldn\u2019t be bothered to measure/order it. Instead he got me a computer thing (~$120) that I would never use (I was very confused and thought I\u2019d opened someone else\u2019s gift), but I was honest about it and he said he would return it and get me the sculpture. My birthday is a month later and once again he\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019ll get you the sculpture\u201d (even though it was supposed to be my Xmas gift?)\u2026he gets me a T-shirt and a book. After he basically made me spend $700 on him for his bday and he makes more $ than me. He brings up the sculpture again and says he\u2019ll get it for me (so now it\u2019s a birthday gift?) and also says he\u2019ll take me out for a fancy dinner. Neither happened. I asked today if he had ordered the sculpture (a month later) and he got all mad? Basically called me ungrateful and made me feel like I was going to make him broke (but he bought concert tickets tonight for him and his friend that cost more)\u2026AITA? Like I know we shouldn\u2019t \u201cexpect\u201d gifts and stuff, but he\u2019s been promising it to me for months and then to get mad at me when I bring it up? We\u2019ve been together 3 years and it has slowly gone downhill\u2026\n\nUPDATE: I dumped him. I already wanted to but felt as though him not getting me the gift I wanted was a selfish reason and people would think I was a jerk. But you\u2019re right- It\u2019s so much more than that. I appreciate you all for helping me find the courage. Hopefully next time I\u2019ll be able to find it on my own! \ud83e\udef6", "created_utc": 1678062648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jj0l3/aita_my_boyfriend_gave_me_an_iou_but_now_wont/", "score": 1008, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
