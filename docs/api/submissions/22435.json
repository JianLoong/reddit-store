I am very good at discovering what will set people off and poking them at those tender spots.  The way to get me to stop is finding my buttons and poking me.  A lot of pranksters can dish it out but cannot take it.  So this is what you should do: I am sure you know where his buttons are - start pushing them, and see if he is also \"psycho.\"", "YTA\n\nThrow your socks and underwear too and have a play fight.", "Don't get mad, get even.
