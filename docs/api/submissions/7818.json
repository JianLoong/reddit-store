I had Jess when I was in college and unfortunately, her father passed away when she was 2. By that time, I had graduated college and was in a one bedroom apartment barely making enough money to survive. \n\nThroughout Jess\u2019s childhood, whenever she asked for something, I would have to say no because we couldn\u2019t afford it. She stopped asking me for things around the time she was 10 and by 16, she had a job. \n\nA year later, Jess came to me and asked if I could pay for her half of her college tuition. I said that I couldn\u2019t because I was still working at a low wage job and needed money for Jennie. She was very mad and we didn\u2019t speak until she went to college in another city, where we went semi NC.\n\nA year later, I met my now husband, Sam. Sam was a blessing sent by god. He completely turned mine and Jennie\u2019s lives around and by a year, we were living together and in 3 years, we got engaged.. We got married in a beautiful resort in Hawaii but we didn\u2019t invite Jess because we thought that she couldn\u2019t afford a trip there. \n\nJess somehow found out that we got married and she blew up my phone. She was furious that she didn\u2019t get an invitation. I told her I thought we were being considerate because she was fresh out of college and couldn\u2019t afford a trip to Hawaii. I also reminded her that we didn\u2019t speak  for years and only texted here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been 5 years since my wedding and we\u2019ve been starting to talk more often. She was at my house on Monday and Jennie walked in, asking if I could pay for her. I agreed and that was that. Once Jennie left the room, Jess blew up at me. She asked me why she had to pay for college on her own and had to be in debt while Jennie gets a free trip. I told her that circumstances were different and we\u2019re better financially.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole. She said that it wasn\u2019t fair and that she wasn\u2019t even invited to my wedding or given a plane ticket to come. I had enough and snapped and told her to get over it since it\u2019s been years. She stormed off and we haven\u2019t spoken since I told Sam and a couple of my friends and they\u2019re conflicted. \n\nAm I the asshole for treating my daughters different?", "created_utc": 1674199325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gqkbt/aita_for_treating_my_daughters_different/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe Jess was a mistake for her. Poor girl", "No, someone who loves their kid would try to mend the relationship. OP is busy trying to ignore her daughter valid hurt", "Good respond and op YTA, be a better human.", "OP isn't an asshole for not paying for college if she couldn't afford it at the time. That is the case for thousands of American families. But the freaking Hawaiian wedding thing is off the charts AH. Not only not invited but not even told about it? Mom didn't offer to buy a ticket for her oldest child who she had put through poverty her whole life? Huge AH. Even bigger AH for pretending (because she absolutely knows very well how awful she is) that she \"just doesn't understand\".", "At least she never has to speak to op ever again", "How is OP not an asshole for how she treats Jess? Like sure not paying for a ticket is one thing, but not even texting your daughter about the fact you're getting married? \n\nAlso don't have kids if you can't afford them? It's really not that different to not have kids.. Especially if you already have one and can't afford that one, don't get another one.", "It baffles me that you guys think this is real", "Both kids seem to be mistakes. She had Jennie when she was still in no position to raise Jess. Just a deadbeat looking for someone to pay her way.", "Because it looks like Jess's estrangement was Jess's idea?\nMillions of people have kids without the ability to give them much more than food, clothing and shelter.", "Oh come on, don't be a spoilsport. When you are reading a book, do you also complain that dragons and Hobbits don't exist?", "Lol. It's crazy you think it couldn't b. My bio mom refused to give me info to apply for loans and I would pay off and have outside financial support but not only gave that info to my lil sister but is supporting her even paying rent for her in la.", "Wait \u2026 what makes you think it\u2019s not real? \ud83d\ude05 not saying it is just I\u2019m v gullible so when other (smarter lol) people spot a fake I always want to know how!", "Yeah that\u2019s fair, but then OP spent money on Jennie right in front of Jess and gave Jennie everything that she couldn\u2019t give Jess. \n\nAnd she\u2019s still doing it even though she has the means to afford things now. \n\nJess chose to go NC, and OP chose to favour one daughter over another. And look at how OP talks about Jess, as if she were some friend rather than her own flesh and blood.", "That's not an excuse. This Millions of people shouldn't have kids either if they can't afford them, this shouldn't be that shocking to y'all at all. It should be damn normal. \n\nAnd even if it was Jess's idea, the reason is because OP spend a lot of money directly on Jennie in front of her.. She didn't even invite, let alone text Jess about her engagement?! How us that normal parent behavior", "Pretty sure there isn't a single post in AITA that doesn't have *someone* saying they're fake. And a lot of them almost certainly are. But debating whether or not it's fake really ruins the enjoyment for me personally (although I do find it comforting for the particularly egregious ones). YMMV though.", "I'm not inside OP's head, but mightn't that be an effect of Jess's going NC?", "I sometimes think people read them just to claim they\u2019re fake.", "Honestly I mostly just take things at face value and assume they\u2019re true. Otherwise yeah any of them could be made up. This person just seemed very confident this one was fake so I\u2019m curious.", "She was doing it while her daughter still lived in the home with them and before the NC happened.", "The first NC, when Jess wanted college help, but OP couldn't swing it. Sounded like Jennie wasn't getting much then."]}
