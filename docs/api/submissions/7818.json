I had Jess when I was in college and unfortunately, her father passed away when she was 2. By that time, I had graduated college and was in a one bedroom apartment barely making enough money to survive. \n\nThroughout Jess\u2019s childhood, whenever she asked for something, I would have to say no because we couldn\u2019t afford it. She stopped asking me for things around the time she was 10 and by 16, she had a job. \n\nA year later, Jess came to me and asked if I could pay for her half of her college tuition. I said that I couldn\u2019t because I was still working at a low wage job and needed money for Jennie. She was very mad and we didn\u2019t speak until she went to college in another city, where we went semi NC.\n\nA year later, I met my now husband, Sam. Sam was a blessing sent by god. He completely turned mine and Jennie\u2019s lives around and by a year, we were living together and in 3 years, we got engaged.. We got married in a beautiful resort in Hawaii but we didn\u2019t invite Jess because we thought that she couldn\u2019t afford a trip there. \n\nJess somehow found out that we got married and she blew up my phone. She was furious that she didn\u2019t get an invitation. I told her I thought we were being considerate because she was fresh out of college and couldn\u2019t afford a trip to Hawaii. I also reminded her that we didn\u2019t speak  for years and only texted here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been 5 years since my wedding and we\u2019ve been starting to talk more often. She was at my house on Monday and Jennie walked in, asking if I could pay for her. I agreed and that was that. Once Jennie left the room, Jess blew up at me. She asked me why she had to pay for college on her own and had to be in debt while Jennie gets a free trip. I told her that circumstances were different and we\u2019re better financially.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole. She said that it wasn\u2019t fair and that she wasn\u2019t even invited to my wedding or given a plane ticket to come. I had enough and snapped and told her to get over it since it\u2019s been years. She stormed off and we haven\u2019t spoken since I told Sam and a couple of my friends and they\u2019re conflicted. \n\nAm I the asshole for treating my daughters different?", "created_utc": 1674199325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gqkbt/aita_for_treating_my_daughters_different/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mom was too \"tired\" from work to accompany me as I purchased my first vehicle at 21. I've missed multiple funerals (grandparents) because I couldn't afford to fly home from my overseas/long distance duty station last minute. Never got offered any help by my \"family.\"\n\nMy little sister got her senior yearbook, her senior trip, and all of her pageant expenses paid for. She got her first car paid for. She's in college now and receives birthday gifts, Christmas gifts, random money, Tiffany jewelry, trips...and I've gotten nothing over the years. \n\nI was stationed in my home state, five hours from my hometown for THREE years and I only saw my mom three times. That's the state of our relationship at this point. She moved to a new home, and she didn't even tell me. I had to google it. \n\nI'm at work, so I can't, but reading this makes me want to cry. I know EXACTLY how your older daughter feels. Like an afterthought. Less than an afterthought. She's better off without her \"mother\", just like I've been better off without mine.", "As Fall Out Boy said in 2023, \u201cI'll never go, I just want to be invited.\"\n\nJust because you resent having your daughter doesn't mean you get to treat her like trash", "YTA you clearly resent your oldest daughter and have no problem treating her terribly.", "YTA. Damn, I get that you\u2019re in a very different financial position but you have absolutely no empathy for your first daughter who also has to struggle through life because you couldn\u2019t give her much. Like, absolutely zero. \n\nAnd really? You didn\u2019t offer to pay for her ticket to her mother\u2019s destination wedding? You didn\u2019t even send her an invite? Way to tell her you don\u2019t care about her and she doesn\u2019t matter to you. I\u2019m honestly appalled at how you\u2019ve behaved towards your firstborn.", "YTA - what a horrible mother you are", ">We got married in a beautiful resort in Hawaii but we didn\u2019t invite Jess because we thought that she couldn\u2019t afford a trip there.\n\nYou can't even pay for her when you have money. Op you are a short parent you don't want to make up with Jess even a little bit. I'm so sad for Jess as mentioned in earlier comments you can volunteer to pay for her in something but instead you yelled. Please don't blame Jess, in my opinion her reaction is reasonable and right. You never see her as your daughter but just a responsibility and now that responsibility is over for you.\n\nYTA, Not even paying for your underappreciated and badly treated daughter by you is so shitty that is beyond words. I can definitely say Jess went NC not because of money problems but because of your behaviour.\n\nOh and I am telling you all this because my mother was also a single mother heck we even had to think what we will eat the next month but atleast she was up and supportive of me in any and everything. Even I didn't get anything I fancied or wanted but I still love my mother amd will always do.", "YTA - Goes to show college doesn\u2019t produce smart people.", "I get that the first daughter's father died when she was young and couldn't support them.  What happened to the second daughter's father?", "It\u2019s funny you saying \u201chere\u2019s where I may be the asshole\u201d you have been the asshole for years", "I\u2019m going to vote YTA. I didn\u2019t get an invite to my dad\u2019s wedding and I\u2019m still a little sad about it 10 years later. I was 18 and he did this for the same reason. I was in college and couldn\u2019t afford to travel there he just didn\u2019t invite me at all. It really made me feel like he didn\u2019t want \u201cold baggage\u201d (the children) in his new life, so I can sympathize with Jess for sure. Horrible way to treat your daughter.", ">Here\u2019s where I may be the asshole.\n\nNo, no. Dont sell yourself short. You have been the asshole long before this.", "Yta. I hope your daughter goes fully NC", "YTA I would be incredibly hurt to not even be told about my mother\u2019s wedding", "Mommy Dearest! Pity your child. YTA.", "Hm, I'm trying to see this from your point of view. You weren't able to provide a lot for your older daughter when she was growing up - nothing wrong with that, and you're not TA for that. You're not TA for not paying for her college or getting remarried. What YTA for is the wedding situation. First, it doesn't even seem like you told her you planned to get married! Second, it doesn't sound like you were close enough to your daughter for you to know her whole financial situation. Maybe she could have made the trip to Hawaii. Even if not, it sounds (correct me if I'm wrong) like you now have the financial resources to be able to pay for her to attend the wedding. With all of this together, YTA. You've displayed clear favoritism and shown your older daughter that she doesn't matter to you. I wouldn't be surprised if she limits contact with you moving forward.", "You\u2019re an awful mother and I hope if you ever read this thread you\u2019ll put your ego aside and finally be kind to your daughter.", "Wow YTA and a horrible mother. I\u2019m disgusted but your attitude.", "Yta....poor Jess\n\nPay her debt for her", "YTA. This is your daughter and you didn't even think to extend an invite to her for your wedding? Did your husband pay for your youngest to go? Then the oldest should have been offered half of the cost. \n\nInstead, you have to make sure you have enough money for your youngest only. \n\nMy parents were on the fine line bordering poverty growing up. And I knew very young, around 4. I learned never to ask for anything as mom controlled the bank account and any extra money always went to my younger sister. Even though they couldn't pay bills my sister got everything. Me? Nothing.\n\nYou taught your oldest the same thing I was taught: she is last place to everything else in your life.\n\nAnd you act surprised she cut you out of her life. Don't be surprised when she doesn't talk to you for the forseable future.", "YTA. They are both your daughters and deserve the same considerations.  It\u2019s a terrible feeling as a daughter to see and know a sibling gets better treatment.  You should make amends and apologize for the poor choices you have made. She should have been invited to your wedding and it should have been a priority to you to include her.  Sad that you don\u2019t fully recognize this.", "yta and quite frankly to me it feels like you resent her and are punishing her for the life you lived early on it's not her fault you weren't as well off when you had her so why are you treating her like shit and likes she's less then you", "\"I didn't invite her to my wedding because we were only texting a few times a year at that point.\"\n\nOP-- I only text my brother on birthdays and Christmas and I was the best man at his wedding. \n\nLmao you didn't invite her because you thought she couldn't afford it? You really framed it in your mind like you were doing her a favor by sparing her a financial burden, yet you didn't even shoot her a text to let her know you were getting married beforehand.\n\nLmao my buddy (who is very low contact with his dad) at least got a \"btw I'm getting married Saturday at the court house. You can come if you want\" text from his dad. \n\nIt sounds like you think of her as some random person in your life who just didn't make the cut at your wedding because you aren't as close anymore, not as your daughter. \n\nSounds like she is low contact because she thinks you don't care about her. And instead of trying to let her know you care about her or show her you care about her and that things were just financially hard when she was growing up, you just confirm her feelings at every turn. \n\nYTA", "YTA.", "NTA, you were at a different place financially when your eldest was growing up. Then your daughter didn\u2019t speak to you for years after you couldn\u2019t contribute to her tuition. Parents aren\u2019t required to pay their children\u2019s college tuition especially when you were a single parent with financial issues and a 7yo when your eldest was going to college.  I can understand why you didn\u2019t invite your daughter as you wrote you two haven\u2019t spoken in years prior to it. Your daughter is a grown adult now and you can\u2019t redo the past. She chose to go Nc previously so she didn\u2019t get a wedding invite, you can\u2019t force a relationship with someone that doesn\u2019t want to maintain one.", "I'd love to know why this AH had a second child when she couldn't afford the first. And why she gallivanted off to Hawaii without inviting her eldest and paying for her (the least she could do now she's living it rich)? Some people just shouldn't have children.", "This. I think people often forget just how much being thought of enough to get an invite can mean. Not to mention if they could afford to do a destination wedding - I honestly don't believe that they couldn't afford to pay for her daughters ticket! It wasn't just some random stranger. Yes they were estranged but it could have been an olive branch offering. Even not doing that once they started taking again offering ot help pay of student debts for a down payment for a house? It's only fair if op is going to pay for her other daughter college. Either she's punishing her oldest for going nc. Pr punshing her because she blames her for being the reason she struggled...", "op sees people as objects and not individuals.", "Agreed. I get circumstances change, but OP didn\u2019t acknowledge any missteps she made to her daughter, didn\u2019t try to reconcile, she just yelled, didn\u2019t think her daughter might want to be involved in her life. No wonder daughter is low contact. OP, YTA.", "Agreed. Buy her a ticket to your wedding. It is quite literally the LEAST you could do if you cared at all about your relationship with her. \n\nOP is the AH", "It seems like op resents the oldest. Probably because shes a reminder of her struggles before hubby.", "I\u2019m gonna jump on top comment so MAYBE OP sees this.\n\n\nMy father got married at a beautiful resort in Hawaii, he had his new wife and 2 stepdaughters present. He never invited my older sister or I, didn\u2019t even give us the chance to pay our own way. I will never forgive him for that.\n\n\nI know exactly how she feels.\n\nIn her eyes you just solidified not only do you have a favourite child, it\u2019s definitely not her. YTA, op. Do better before she stops talking to you altogether.", "I cannot fathom this. HUGE YTA to the OP. Didn\u2019t invite her own daughter to her freaking WEDDING?? Wtf", "Yeah this part! Absolutely doing my fucking head in. What kind of ginormous asshole does this??", "we were barely talking when i got married", "I don\u2019t think that this is real. It\u2019s a new account + look at the user name.", "This is exactly it. I was wondering if anyone would say it. My mom treats me exactly like OP. I'm the scapegoat and my little sister is the golden child. This was incredibly validating. I've always felt like I was reacting too harshly.", "I can't imagine why /s", "You said you texted here and there, you didn\u2019t consider a new husband to be important enough to be one of those rare occasions?", "Why do you hate your daughter so much?", "literally no one except hawaiians should be having weddings in hawaii", "If it's really I'm guessing it's written by the older daughter, to show what an AH her mom is. People who are this shitty usually don't care if they're TAH or not", "And they neverrrrrrrr reply to any comments", "I used to think most of what I read here was fake.  I'm 56 years old and never encountered anyone as terrible or clueless as this op or a lot of the others I read about here.  Then my nephew got married, and his MIL and BIL are exactly the kind of people you read about on AITA, the just no subs, and the adult estranged child sub.  It was an eye opener.", "things like this happen in real life, this is one of the more plausible ones.", "Oh I think there's a good chance most of these are fake- but. I've met some pretty horrible people in life and still could see it being real unfortunately", "In the majority of dysfunctional families, there's (1) a golden child, (2) a scapegoat, and a totally unself-aware parent. This is so common it is very believable.", "Even if it's not, it's fun to pretend it could be. Most stories on the internet are fake, but playing up like they're real is a source of entertainment.", "Do you even like your daughter?", "here and there as in once in a few months for christmas and birthdays. only small talk", "Sadly I don\u2019t and it got deleted.", "She\u2019s was still your daughter. Did it occur to you that paying for her to go to your wedding would have done a lot for your relationship?", "Got it, so you only talked for holidays and major life events. Guess marrying the man who was \u201ca blessing sent by god\u201d isn\u2019t considered a major life event in your eyes", "With \u201cmothers\u201d like this, who needs enemies?", "I remember one time I was laid off and my wife was only able to find part time work. I was complaining about the price of groceries and that we couldn't afford to eat. My dad went on a rant about how unemployment shouldn't be a thing told me that you can survive for a long time on rice and beans. Next breath he turned around to my sister as she was leaving and asked if she'd grabbed the 4 bags of food they picked up for her and not to forget anything like she did last time.\n\nI'll never forget the way he reinforced that I don't deserve anything from them while she deserves nice extras.", "Yeah, it's so exhausting.  There's always that air of snottiness about it, too, like they're some kind of genius for throwing poop all over the comment section.", "My dad did the same, though it actually worked out for me. School was like \u201cjust use your mom\u2019s\u201d and so I did and she made 1/4 of what my dad did so I got free tuition. He did not enjoy that.\n\nHe also abandoned me at new student orientation and drove 1.5 hours home and left me to figure out how to get home on my own.\n\nShockingly, we no longer talk."]}
