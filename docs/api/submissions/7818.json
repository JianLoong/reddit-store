I had Jess when I was in college and unfortunately, her father passed away when she was 2. By that time, I had graduated college and was in a one bedroom apartment barely making enough money to survive. \n\nThroughout Jess\u2019s childhood, whenever she asked for something, I would have to say no because we couldn\u2019t afford it. She stopped asking me for things around the time she was 10 and by 16, she had a job. \n\nA year later, Jess came to me and asked if I could pay for her half of her college tuition. I said that I couldn\u2019t because I was still working at a low wage job and needed money for Jennie. She was very mad and we didn\u2019t speak until she went to college in another city, where we went semi NC.\n\nA year later, I met my now husband, Sam. Sam was a blessing sent by god. He completely turned mine and Jennie\u2019s lives around and by a year, we were living together and in 3 years, we got engaged.. We got married in a beautiful resort in Hawaii but we didn\u2019t invite Jess because we thought that she couldn\u2019t afford a trip there. \n\nJess somehow found out that we got married and she blew up my phone. She was furious that she didn\u2019t get an invitation. I told her I thought we were being considerate because she was fresh out of college and couldn\u2019t afford a trip to Hawaii. I also reminded her that we didn\u2019t speak  for years and only texted here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been 5 years since my wedding and we\u2019ve been starting to talk more often. She was at my house on Monday and Jennie walked in, asking if I could pay for her. I agreed and that was that. Once Jennie left the room, Jess blew up at me. She asked me why she had to pay for college on her own and had to be in debt while Jennie gets a free trip. I told her that circumstances were different and we\u2019re better financially.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole. She said that it wasn\u2019t fair and that she wasn\u2019t even invited to my wedding or given a plane ticket to come. I had enough and snapped and told her to get over it since it\u2019s been years. She stormed off and we haven\u2019t spoken since I told Sam and a couple of my friends and they\u2019re conflicted. \n\nAm I the asshole for treating my daughters different?", "created_utc": 1674199325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gqkbt/aita_for_treating_my_daughters_different/", "score": 385, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mom was too \"tired\" from work to accompany me as I purchased my first vehicle at 21. I've missed multiple funerals (grandparents) because I couldn't afford to fly home from my overseas/long distance duty station last minute. Never got offered any help by my \"family.\"\n\nMy little sister got her senior yearbook, her senior trip, and all of her pageant expenses paid for. She got her first car paid for. She's in college now and receives birthday gifts, Christmas gifts, random money, Tiffany jewelry, trips...and I've gotten nothing over the years. \n\nI was stationed in my home state, five hours from my hometown for THREE years and I only saw my mom three times. That's the state of our relationship at this point. She moved to a new home, and she didn't even tell me. I had to google it. \n\nI'm at work, so I can't, but reading this makes me want to cry.

Maybe it'll mend some bridges, maybe it'll take away some resentment. maybe it won't.  That much money can mean a big difference in a new car, a down payment on a house, or even paying off what is left of student loans.
