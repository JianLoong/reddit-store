I love my boyfriend, and I have had no serious issues with him until recently, and that\u2019s because of his mother.\n\nA couple months back, his grandmother found a Plan B in his truck that we had used because accidents happen right ? Well, his mother thought this to be extremely concerning and had a serious talk to my boyfriend about it. Which I understand. However, I told my boyfriend I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her place to tell me what to put into my body and I do not wish to discuss it with her. He in turn told her that I was uncomfortable with talking to her.\n\nWell, later when I came to his house to spend time with him, after we had all had dinner, she trapped me in the conversation, and talked to me about birth control. She talked to me about the patch, the pill, iud, and the implant. She also offered to pay for an IUD for me, which I recognize as kind, but it still seemed incredibly intrusive, because it wasn\u2019t something that I wanted from her. At the time, I didn\u2019t know if I had the right to be upset about the conversation.\n\nAt the time, I wasn\u2019t on the pill because I didn\u2019t like the weight I was gaining while on it and the idea of not having my period at all made me extremely anxious, so I was trying to find other options. She did not ask me once why I wasn\u2019t on it, what I was doing to take precautions, or why it was that I had taken the plan b. She did not care to know, which frustrated me and made me feel like she thought I was stupid and reckless, even though I am just as anxious.\n\nFast forward to now. Two days ago my boyfriend randomly asked me what pill I was on, because after the conversation I went back on it because I never wanted to talk about it again and thought it was just the end of that. My boyfriend has never cared what pill I was on, so I found this question to be odd.\n\nI asked him why he cared, he said he was researching it, which I knew was bullshit, and said did your mom ask ? He came out clean and admitted that yes his mom asked what specific pill I was on.\n\nI was furious with my boyfriend for bringing the conversation back to me when he knows that I don\u2019t want to talk to his mom about my birth control and I was upset with his mother for once again treating myself not like a person, but like something her son sticks his dick into. She didn\u2019t ask how I was or how my life was going, but immediately asked about my fucking vagina.\n\nIt was later in our argument that he told me his mom had said that she wouldn\u2019t let him see me if she didn\u2019t know what specific pill I was on because she was going to think he was going to get me pregnant. Or that I was lying.\n\nI feel furious with his mother, but I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m the asshole for being upset about it in the first place and if I\u2019m blowing it out of proportion.

You are both very young so I will refrain from unnecessary comments about his maturity level here. But that is still some serious mommy issues happening here.", "NTA, your boyfriend's mother is completely out of line. I'm the mother of 3 sons. It's their responsibility to control their sperm. I can't imagine hounding a girlfriend over birth control. It's not my place. Your boyfriend doesn't sound mature enough for an intimate relationship. Considering his mother is so involved in his sex life, smh.", "No that's weird.", "It's absolutely none of her business. If she asks again, ask her what she uses.", "NTA. It is intrusive to have her discuss it with you.\n\nAnd if his mother's so worried about her son getting a woman pregnant, why doesn't she suggest he wear a condom?", "NAH\n\nLook, I get it. She shouldn\u2019t be asking all these questions about your birth control. But from her point of view, you\u2019re a sexually active teenager whose use of birth control is\u2026inconsistent. Offering to pay for birth control is cheaper than a grandchild.", "NTA It's your body. You know what's best for you not a stranger (no matter who she is). Tell your bf to tell his mother to butt out. Or tell her yourself. At this point it sounds like you're dating both him and her. If you can't get the her away from your relationship with him you might want to reevaluate whether or not the relationship is worth it.", "NTA you do need to speak up to her that you understand your options and will handle it yourself. If I were this mom, my intentions would just be to make sure you know the options - a lot of young people aren\u2019t getting this type of information. She didn\u2019t ask why - well, she probably doesn\u2019t want to think about her sons actions that caused you to need plan b so she\u2019s just info dumping on you. \n\nThe last bit is way out of line of her. He does have the right to ask that for his own information as well he\u2019d be dad. \n\nYou do need to talk to her directly - I don\u2019t know this mom and some are real AHs, some are just worried for their child tho and it\u2019s not a reflection of how they necessarily feel about you personally. A baby at 18 is a BFD.", "NTA - but as a parent of kids your age, I can understand some of her concern.  I don't want to raise another kid or see my kids get thrown into parenthood before they are ready.  So I've talked to them and made sure they had what they needed to prevent that from happening.  \n  \nWhere she's out of line is trying to control you and what you do to protect yourself.  Why she would care which method you use is beyond me.  I'd just be happy knowing that my kids were being safe. \n  \nIf she is telling your boyfriend that he can't see you, it might be a good opportunity to help him stand up to her and set boundaries with her.  Tell him that it's none of her business what pill you take.  And that he should tell her that.  Your body is none of her concern.  All she should need to know is that you are taking whatever steps you can to prevent pregnancy.

The fact that you're dating her son doesn't entitle her to know anything about you that you're not willing to share with her. \n\nIf she's worried about you baby-trapping her son, all you can do is tell her that you are taking the precautions that work best for you and that you're actively avoiding pregnancy. \n\nYou are both adults, and she can not control who he chooses to date. If your BF is willing to stop seeing you just because his mom tells him too, he's not right for you.", "Uh. NTA. \n\n\nShe's not your doctor. Your preferred method of birth control is not her business.

Not you. \n\nThat she didn't even ask you *why* you aren't currently on the pill is an issue. How could she not want to know that and in the same breath expect you to take her medical advice to heart? It doesn't sound like your boyfriend cares much about the *why* either. Clearly he's okay with making you uncomfortable if it means getting his mom of his back. \n\nI get being super freaked out about the Plan B thing, but there are much better ways to go about this.", "You don't have a MIL problem, you have a boyfriend problem. Your boyfriend is not expressing to her and supporting your boundaries with his mother. He needs to say to his mother that this is none of her business and it seems doubtful he will stand up to her. It sounds like he is still living at home. In the long term how do you see this playing out in the long term. Do you think he will just fet it one day and live his own life. Doubtful for a mama's boy but could happen, the question that really matters though is how many years is she going to be in your business and making decisions for her grown son. Are you willing to wait the years it might take for him to come out of the fog", "while i understand that his mom is probably coming at this from an honest place, i think she's forgetting the fact that she's asking incredibly personal medical information which she is not entitled to. i don't think she's trying to control you or be overbearing; it's likely she's worried/stressed, and going about it in a less than nuanced manner. i think a sit down conversation in which you both get a chance to say your piece and listen to each other actively without interruptions, it could go a long way towards both assuring her of yalls maturity and helping everyone get on the same page. you have every right to be upset at someone nosing into a personal medical issue, but i don't think your bf's mom is specifically trying to be malicious or make you uncomfortable. at some point, she's just gonna have to start trusting that you and her son will be responsible, which is an understandably hard leap for a parent to take when so much (a pregnancy/the rest of her son's and your lives) is at stake.", "NTA. It\u2019s none of her business. \n\nBirth control sucks. Coming from the person who can\u2019t use the pill effectively because of a stomach/bowel disorder. \n\nI\u2019ve tried the implant and an IUD and both just killed my sex drive and messed with my hormones, we didn\u2019t realise how much until I got my IUD taken out to start trying for a baby. \n\nAfter the IUD I was suddenly losing the weight I tried to get rid of for years. The no periods was kind of nice but you get break through bleed when you ovulate. They recommend taking a pregnancy test every couple of months while on it though, just to be safe. \n\nWe aren\u2019t going back on birth control after baby is born. Hubby will have a vasectomy when we\u2019re done having kids.", "As a nurse who worked in maternity for 17 years and took care of first time Mom's who were 12 and first time moms who were 43, I am very comfortable talking about sex and birth control. A lot of parents are not ( especially in the USA). With my kids friends and partners, I always let them know I was open to talking about anything they wanted to discuss regarding sex, birth control, consent, etc. I talked to my boys about my expectation that they were just as responsible as girls for birth control, and STD protection. I understand where his mom is coming from ( took care of 12 year old mom), but she seriously overstepped here. NTA", "Honestly? NAH\n\nBirth control isn't this weird, taboo subject. She knows the two of you are clearly having sex and needed a plan B. Checking in with you about what protection you were using isn't this huge deal you're making it out to be.\n\nAlso it kinda just sounds like she wanted her son to make sure you were on the pill which...valid. If you're in a serious, monogamous relationship and that is the protection you are using then he should have that information as well.\n\nEnd of the day, birth control isn't something you feel uncomfortable talking about. She clearly wanted you to be informed and was even willing to help you get some. That isn't this horrible thing you're making it out to be.", "You\u2019re both adults. How can she forbid him from seeing you?\n\nNTA and better to know now you\u2019re involved with a Mama\u2019s boy.", "Nta mom is definitely only watching out for her own and not caring about you at all. You are 18, you do not have to discuss your medical history or prescriptions with anyone. She needs to learn to accept that she's not going to have access or control of every aspect of her son's life anymore", "Time to find a new boyfriend. Mom is too involved in his private/sex life. Not much of a future. If he has no backbone to tell butt out. It will only get worse.", "NTA. Fuck me that's weird of her. I'm betting she doesn't enquire about what brand of condom her son is using so why should she be enquiring about this.", "NTA. That\u2019s weird, like super weird.

That's a hard boundary that I would have.

If he\u2019s suddenly so concerned, he can also make sure to use a condom every time or even do other things besides the specific way you get someone pregnant. \n\nYes, these are really important conversations for a couple, however, it begins with him handling his own side of the business and not putting all the pressure on you and betraying your privacy to his mom.\n\nAlso, heads up: unless he starts setting firm boundaries with his mom now, you\u2019re looking at a benign version of things to come.

I do think he should have defended me better, and he does too.", "The thing is he does. I would never allow that, I get so anxious about pregnancy. That\u2019s why it was so frustrating to me is because I understand the anxiety of it, but at least incorporate me into the conversation!", "I agree. She really shouldn't ask but if that was my kid it would keep me up at night. She should lay off for sure but I understand exactly what she's worried about.

Sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do and his mom's intrusiveness makes a lot more sense in this context.\n\nStill, you're NTA - she doesn't need to know what specific birth control you're on. That's weird and intrusive. This sounds reflective of a broader lack of trust in her son's decisions, but she shouldn't be taking it out on you.", "This comment leads me to believe this is more about her son then it is about you. He's 19 years old and doesn't clean up after himself or contribute to the house he is living in. He's immature. She finds Plan B and panics thinking of how her son that won't even pick up his own laundry  is having unprotected sex. She doesn't want two babies to take care of since the first one isn't showing even a small amount of responsibility.\n\nHer conversation with you may have felt intrusive, but her concerns are valid. She probably doesn't trust her son to be the one to make those important preventative decisions.", "This actually changes things a little. I think the reason she doesn't trust you to behave responsibly might be that she doesn't trust your BF to behave responsibly. He's slacking, and she's frustrated with him, so she's projecting that onto you. She doesn't know you very well. She's worried that her son is going to make a life-altering mistake and she wants assurances that you're not as careless as she thinks her son is. \n\nThis doesn't change my judgment because she still isn't entitled to information you're not willing to share, and she's still threatening to break you up. However, I would say that you shouldn't take it personally. It's less about you and more about your BF.", "I mean, those are pretty valid fears for him to have. At the same time... that's something he needs to work out with his mom. He should be the one reassuring her that you two are being safe and doing what you can. \n\nThe solution here can't be: *I have to go on birth control, which I know I don't like, so my boyfriend can have a good relationship with his mom*. That's ridiculous. Those two things aren't related, but your boyfriend's mom is making them related and he's letting her. \n\nI know it'd likely be very uncomfortable, but I think all three of you should sit down together and hash it out. You should tell her why you're not currently on birth control and why you will not start taking birth control. Your boyfriend can then step in and say, \"Here's how we plan to practice protection though...\" and the two of you can tell her as little or as much as you want *together*. You and your bf should be a united front on this.", "Oh, but she was concerned about her adult child, that excuses all boundary breaking, didn't you know?", "\"If youre going to talk with me I want to have a conversation, not a one sided scolding. If you want to tell be B, I need to tell you about A first.\"", "If it was awkward for you, it may have also been awkward for her as well.\n\nMaybe bring this up to her and let her know how it made you feel. She probably didn't mean to.\n\nEdit: Based on your other comment about how she is about to start charging rent if he doesn't step up and start taking care of things, it honestly seems like she's trying to teach responsibility. Hence her wanting to make sure you're both being safe and not going to end up with a child when he hasn't even learned to take care of himself yet.", "Wait, do you not know?\n\nYou should definitely know what brand and type he uses for a few reasons.", "Well on the plus side I got a laugh out of this and good on your parents for being supportive. Still sucks for you though.\n\nIf you want to be terribly evil lay out a selection of condoms on a tray one day and then present them to her. Ask which one she thinks her son should be using seeing as she's that concerned about possibly pregnancies surely she should have an opinion much as she does on your birth control. For bonus points make sure to do so in front of other people and make sure they know why you're asking. Do not however do this unless you are willing to make an enemy for life because that may well be her reaction.", "IMO, one or both of your parents should give her a call and tell her to quit bullying you and that you and your gynecologist have your birth control situation under control and she has no place in your healthcare choices. \n\n\nI bet it would go a long way in shutting down her paranoia related to you baby trapping her son because she\u2019ll know that not only do you have parental support, you also have a dialogue going with your doctor.

There's chances it can perforate your uterus, cause scarring, make someone infertile for life. Does his mother plan on footing the bill for any future complications and removal? Probably not. It's not a set it and forget it type thing. You have to check the string consistently and for some people it makes their periods worse and inconsistent.

I had a friend who got the kyleena because of how painful the mirena was for me. It ended up causing her to develop ovarian cysts. One day she was having sex, and bam, crippling pain, bent over, had to tell her mother and get rushed to the ER. The newer IUDs are smaller yes, but from everyone I've talked to, the side effects were not worth it. 2/5 people I knew with the kyleena developed ovarian cysts as teenagers. I knew 1 girl with the mirena like me, and she bled for 2 months after it, and it turns out they punctured her uterus and the scarring makes it so they predicted she will have a very hard time ever having children. \n\nIdgaf if it's her son, it's not her body, not her risks of er visits and additional costs and life long consequences. She can buy them condoms if it really keeps her up at night like that. \n\nThe only 4 birth controls with a consistent 99.99% protection rate, are the pill, an IUD, DEPO shot, and the nexplanon. Everything else has lower protection rates, including condoms. None of those 4 come without side effects. I have been on 3 of them. If you have history of mental illness, the depo is not a good option, or if you care about not getting really fat while on it.

Turned out it was also the reason for so many condoms breaking during sex. The plastic was tearing the condom putting me at risk of exposure to potential STDs. \n\nIt's not just based on her experience alone. I refused the kyleena because of the increased risk of ovarian cysts, which is higher than the mirena I was told (5 years ago at least). I also am basing it on everyone I've talked too.

I do not have that kind of money to be treating an issue that doesn't have to ever happen if I just choose a different option. \n\nYou can offer your experience but don't act like it's the majority especially for younger folks.", "I'm sorry but personally out of my friend group every single woman who got an IUD eventually had to get the removed due to the fact that they perforated their uterus.", "That's great! I would say have a conversation with your BF. Help him explain why you are so uncomfortable with his mom's questions. Like some people mentioned, if he genuinely wants to know what BC you're on I think that's fair but if it only because of his mom is where the line needs to happen.\n\nAnd it is good that she is trying to instill responsibility. That is something that is lacking in the world at large. Boundaries are just really important and should be established at the beginning of relationships (if possible). I'm glad you found someone that treats you well and I wish you all the best!", "Where, what world? Grandparents on both sides very often take on the babies of \" not their bsns\".", "So you don\u2019t have $15 but can pay nearly $50 for Plan B? Also his mother offered to help, why was that offensive when you\u2019re clearly having trouble affording it?", "\"You can offer your experience but don't act like it's the majority especially for younger folks\"\n\nI could say the same for you.\n\nAnd yes, of course, it sounds like you had an atypical experience that also happened to be terrible. So yes, you should take that into consideration. But we're not talking about you. We're talking about a random girl on the internet. One who will likely not have complications, as the majority of us don't have those challenges.\n\nI'm just saying, speak your truth, but perhaps try to be a little more balanced? Again, most women don't have issues with IUD's. It's disingenuous to paint your outcome as a common or likely one.", "Yeah, sure jan. IUD perforations occur in less than 0.1% of low-risk patients.", "My boyfriend paid for it a while ago, I didn\u2019t pay for it. It\u2019s offensive to me that she didn\u2019t incorporate me into the conversation when it felt more like a lecture. I do see what you mean though, I suppose my boyfriend needs to pay for my birth control rather than me especially if it\u2019s hard for me to get ahold of. But it honestly doesn\u2019t matter now since I\u2019m back on it, even though I don\u2019t like the side effects of it. Either way, we are taking precautions if I took the plan b."]}
