I love my boyfriend, and I have had no serious issues with him until recently, and that\u2019s because of his mother.\n\nA couple months back, his grandmother found a Plan B in his truck that we had used because accidents happen right ? Well, his mother thought this to be extremely concerning and had a serious talk to my boyfriend about it. Which I understand. However, I told my boyfriend I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her place to tell me what to put into my body and I do not wish to discuss it with her. He in turn told her that I was uncomfortable with talking to her.\n\nWell, later when I came to his house to spend time with him, after we had all had dinner, she trapped me in the conversation, and talked to me about birth control. She talked to me about the patch, the pill, iud, and the implant. She also offered to pay for an IUD for me, which I recognize as kind, but it still seemed incredibly intrusive, because it wasn\u2019t something that I wanted from her. At the time, I didn\u2019t know if I had the right to be upset about the conversation.\n\nAt the time, I wasn\u2019t on the pill because I didn\u2019t like the weight I was gaining while on it and the idea of not having my period at all made me extremely anxious, so I was trying to find other options. She did not ask me once why I wasn\u2019t on it, what I was doing to take precautions, or why it was that I had taken the plan b. She did not care to know, which frustrated me and made me feel like she thought I was stupid and reckless, even though I am just as anxious.\n\nFast forward to now. Two days ago my boyfriend randomly asked me what pill I was on, because after the conversation I went back on it because I never wanted to talk about it again and thought it was just the end of that. My boyfriend has never cared what pill I was on, so I found this question to be odd.\n\nI asked him why he cared, he said he was researching it, which I knew was bullshit, and said did your mom ask ? He came out clean and admitted that yes his mom asked what specific pill I was on.\n\nI was furious with my boyfriend for bringing the conversation back to me when he knows that I don\u2019t want to talk to his mom about my birth control and I was upset with his mother for once again treating myself not like a person, but like something her son sticks his dick into. She didn\u2019t ask how I was or how my life was going, but immediately asked about my fucking vagina.\n\nIt was later in our argument that he told me his mom had said that she wouldn\u2019t let him see me if she didn\u2019t know what specific pill I was on because she was going to think he was going to get me pregnant. Or that I was lying.\n\nI feel furious with his mother, but I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m the asshole for being upset about it in the first place and if I\u2019m blowing it out of proportion.

You are both very young so I will refrain from unnecessary comments about his maturity level here. But that is still some serious mommy issues happening here.", "NTA, your boyfriend's mother is completely out of line. I'm the mother of 3 sons. It's their responsibility to control their sperm. I can't imagine hounding a girlfriend over birth control. It's not my place. Your boyfriend doesn't sound mature enough for an intimate relationship. Considering his mother is so involved in his sex life, smh.", "No that's weird.", "It's absolutely none of her business. If she asks again, ask her what she uses.", "NTA. It is intrusive to have her discuss it with you.\n\nAnd if his mother's so worried about her son getting a woman pregnant, why doesn't she suggest he wear a condom?", "NAH\n\nLook, I get it. She shouldn\u2019t be asking all these questions about your birth control. But from her point of view, you\u2019re a sexually active teenager whose use of birth control is\u2026inconsistent. Offering to pay for birth control is cheaper than a grandchild.", "NTA It's your body. You know what's best for you not a stranger (no matter who she is). Tell your bf to tell his mother to butt out. Or tell her yourself. At this point it sounds like you're dating both him and her. If you can't get the her away from your relationship with him you might want to reevaluate whether or not the relationship is worth it.", "NTA you do need to speak up to her that you understand your options and will handle it yourself. If I were this mom, my intentions would just be to make sure you know the options - a lot of young people aren\u2019t getting this type of information. She didn\u2019t ask why - well, she probably doesn\u2019t want to think about her sons actions that caused you to need plan b so she\u2019s just info dumping on you. \n\nThe last bit is way out of line of her. He does have the right to ask that for his own information as well he\u2019d be dad. \n\nYou do need to talk to her directly - I don\u2019t know this mom and some are real AHs, some are just worried for their child tho and it\u2019s not a reflection of how they necessarily feel about you personally. A baby at 18 is a BFD.", "NTA - but as a parent of kids your age, I can understand some of her concern.  I don't want to raise another kid or see my kids get thrown into parenthood before they are ready.  So I've talked to them and made sure they had what they needed to prevent that from happening.  \n  \nWhere she's out of line is trying to control you and what you do to protect yourself.  Why she would care which method you use is beyond me.  I'd just be happy knowing that my kids were being safe. \n  \nIf she is telling your boyfriend that he can't see you, it might be a good opportunity to help him stand up to her and set boundaries with her.  Tell him that it's none of her business what pill you take.  And that he should tell her that.  Your body is none of her concern.  All she should need to know is that you are taking whatever steps you can to prevent pregnancy.

The fact that you're dating her son doesn't entitle her to know anything about you that you're not willing to share with her. \n\nIf she's worried about you baby-trapping her son, all you can do is tell her that you are taking the precautions that work best for you and that you're actively avoiding pregnancy. \n\nYou are both adults, and she can not control who he chooses to date. If your BF is willing to stop seeing you just because his mom tells him too, he's not right for you.", "Uh. NTA. \n\n\nShe's not your doctor. Your preferred method of birth control is not her business.

Not you. \n\nThat she didn't even ask you *why* you aren't currently on the pill is an issue. How could she not want to know that and in the same breath expect you to take her medical advice to heart? It doesn't sound like your boyfriend cares much about the *why* either. Clearly he's okay with making you uncomfortable if it means getting his mom of his back. \n\nI get being super freaked out about the Plan B thing, but there are much better ways to go about this.", "You don't have a MIL problem, you have a boyfriend problem. Your boyfriend is not expressing to her and supporting your boundaries with his mother. He needs to say to his mother that this is none of her business and it seems doubtful he will stand up to her. It sounds like he is still living at home. In the long term how do you see this playing out in the long term. Do you think he will just fet it one day and live his own life. Doubtful for a mama's boy but could happen, the question that really matters though is how many years is she going to be in your business and making decisions for her grown son. Are you willing to wait the years it might take for him to come out of the fog", "while i understand that his mom is probably coming at this from an honest place, i think she's forgetting the fact that she's asking incredibly personal medical information which she is not entitled to. i don't think she's trying to control you or be overbearing; it's likely she's worried/stressed, and going about it in a less than nuanced manner. i think a sit down conversation in which you both get a chance to say your piece and listen to each other actively without interruptions, it could go a long way towards both assuring her of yalls maturity and helping everyone get on the same page. you have every right to be upset at someone nosing into a personal medical issue, but i don't think your bf's mom is specifically trying to be malicious or make you uncomfortable. at some point, she's just gonna have to start trusting that you and her son will be responsible, which is an understandably hard leap for a parent to take when so much (a pregnancy/the rest of her son's and your lives) is at stake.", "NTA. It\u2019s none of her business. \n\nBirth control sucks. Coming from the person who can\u2019t use the pill effectively because of a stomach/bowel disorder. \n\nI\u2019ve tried the implant and an IUD and both just killed my sex drive and messed with my hormones, we didn\u2019t realise how much until I got my IUD taken out to start trying for a baby. \n\nAfter the IUD I was suddenly losing the weight I tried to get rid of for years. The no periods was kind of nice but you get break through bleed when you ovulate. They recommend taking a pregnancy test every couple of months while on it though, just to be safe. \n\nWe aren\u2019t going back on birth control after baby is born. Hubby will have a vasectomy when we\u2019re done having kids.", "As a nurse who worked in maternity for 17 years and took care of first time Mom's who were 12 and first time moms who were 43, I am very comfortable talking about sex and birth control. A lot of parents are not ( especially in the USA). With my kids friends and partners, I always let them know I was open to talking about anything they wanted to discuss regarding sex, birth control, consent, etc. I talked to my boys about my expectation that they were just as responsible as girls for birth control, and STD protection. I understand where his mom is coming from ( took care of 12 year old mom), but she seriously overstepped here. NTA", "Honestly? NAH\n\nBirth control isn't this weird, taboo subject. She knows the two of you are clearly having sex and needed a plan B. Checking in with you about what protection you were using isn't this huge deal you're making it out to be.\n\nAlso it kinda just sounds like she wanted her son to make sure you were on the pill which...valid. If you're in a serious, monogamous relationship and that is the protection you are using then he should have that information as well.\n\nEnd of the day, birth control isn't something you feel uncomfortable talking about. She clearly wanted you to be informed and was even willing to help you get some. That isn't this horrible thing you're making it out to be.", "You\u2019re both adults. How can she forbid him from seeing you?\n\nNTA and better to know now you\u2019re involved with a Mama\u2019s boy.", "Nta mom is definitely only watching out for her own and not caring about you at all. You are 18, you do not have to discuss your medical history or prescriptions with anyone. She needs to learn to accept that she's not going to have access or control of every aspect of her son's life anymore", "Time to find a new boyfriend. Mom is too involved in his private/sex life. Not much of a future. If he has no backbone to tell butt out. It will only get worse.", "NTA. Fuck me that's weird of her. I'm betting she doesn't enquire about what brand of condom her son is using so why should she be enquiring about this.", "NTA. That\u2019s weird, like super weird.

That's a hard boundary that I would have.

If he\u2019s suddenly so concerned, he can also make sure to use a condom every time or even do other things besides the specific way you get someone pregnant. \n\nYes, these are really important conversations for a couple, however, it begins with him handling his own side of the business and not putting all the pressure on you and betraying your privacy to his mom.\n\nAlso, heads up: unless he starts setting firm boundaries with his mom now, you\u2019re looking at a benign version of things to come.

I do think he should have defended me better, and he does too.", "The thing is he does. I would never allow that, I get so anxious about pregnancy. That\u2019s why it was so frustrating to me is because I understand the anxiety of it, but at least incorporate me into the conversation!", "I agree. She really shouldn't ask but if that was my kid it would keep me up at night. She should lay off for sure but I understand exactly what she's worried about.

Sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do and his mom's intrusiveness makes a lot more sense in this context.\n\nStill, you're NTA - she doesn't need to know what specific birth control you're on. That's weird and intrusive. This sounds reflective of a broader lack of trust in her son's decisions, but she shouldn't be taking it out on you.", "This comment leads me to believe this is more about her son then it is about you. He's 19 years old and doesn't clean up after himself or contribute to the house he is living in. He's immature. She finds Plan B and panics thinking of how her son that won't even pick up his own laundry  is having unprotected sex. She doesn't want two babies to take care of since the first one isn't showing even a small amount of responsibility.\n\nHer conversation with you may have felt intrusive, but her concerns are valid. She probably doesn't trust her son to be the one to make those important preventative decisions.", "This actually changes things a little. I think the reason she doesn't trust you to behave responsibly might be that she doesn't trust your BF to behave responsibly. He's slacking, and she's frustrated with him, so she's projecting that onto you. She doesn't know you very well. She's worried that her son is going to make a life-altering mistake and she wants assurances that you're not as careless as she thinks her son is. \n\nThis doesn't change my judgment because she still isn't entitled to information you're not willing to share, and she's still threatening to break you up. However, I would say that you shouldn't take it personally. It's less about you and more about your BF.", "I mean, those are pretty valid fears for him to have. At the same time... that's something he needs to work out with his mom. He should be the one reassuring her that you two are being safe and doing what you can. \n\nThe solution here can't be: *I have to go on birth control, which I know I don't like, so my boyfriend can have a good relationship with his mom*. That's ridiculous. Those two things aren't related, but your boyfriend's mom is making them related and he's letting her. \n\nI know it'd likely be very uncomfortable, but I think all three of you should sit down together and hash it out. You should tell her why you're not currently on birth control and why you will not start taking birth control. Your boyfriend can then step in and say, \"Here's how we plan to practice protection though...\" and the two of you can tell her as little or as much as you want *together*. You and your bf should be a united front on this.", "Oh, but she was concerned about her adult child, that excuses all boundary breaking, didn't you know?", "\"If youre going to talk with me I want to have a conversation, not a one sided scolding. If you want to tell be B, I need to tell you about A first.\"", "If it was awkward for you, it may have also been awkward for her as well.\n\nMaybe bring this up to her and let her know how it made you feel. She probably didn't mean to.\n\nEdit: Based on your other comment about how she is about to start charging rent if he doesn't step up and start taking care of things, it honestly seems like she's trying to teach responsibility. Hence her wanting to make sure you're both being safe and not going to end up with a child when he hasn't even learned to take care of himself yet.", "Wait, do you not know?\n\nYou should definitely know what brand and type he uses for a few reasons.", "Well on the plus side I got a laugh out of this and good on your parents for being supportive. Still sucks for you though.\n\nIf you want to be terribly evil lay out a selection of condoms on a tray one day and then present them to her. Ask which one she thinks her son should be using seeing as she's that concerned about possibly pregnancies surely she should have an opinion much as she does on your birth control. For bonus points make sure to do so in front of other people and make sure they know why you're asking. Do not however do this unless you are willing to make an enemy for life because that may well be her reaction.", "IMO, one or both of your parents should give her a call and tell her to quit bullying you and that you and your gynecologist have your birth control situation under control and she has no place in your healthcare choices. \n\n\nI bet it would go a long way in shutting down her paranoia related to you baby trapping her son because she\u2019ll know that not only do you have parental support, you also have a dialogue going with your doctor. And since she doesn\u2019t believe you to be responsible, she might back off when she sees that you have a lot more support than she ever did.", "It\u2019s so weird though because they are extremely open about all of it. She used to sell sex toys I think from what my boyfriend told me and she\u2019s told me about her sex life when she was my age on a whim, which made me a little uncomfortable. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because they are just really open, or if she\u2019s just  anxious.", "I definitely will. I just don\u2019t want to do it out of anger too. I don\u2019t want to have a bad relationship with my boyfriends mom lol.", "LMAO YEA I DO. They were just kidding. We go together to buy them so we both know.", "Prob a little of both. She\u2019s anxious, shes experienced being a parent young. She doesn\u2019t want you or her son to have the same struggle. Her approach is odd, but this is new content for her too.", "See my edit. She actually seems like she has a good head on her shoulders and is expecting him to grow up and act like an adult instead of babying him.\n\nI would just approach it by saying you understand her wanting you to be responsible and be aware of your choices but it hurt your feelings how sterile it was.", "His mom is TA. How incredible TA she is. Saying she'll put a stop to your relationship.\n\nYou might want to rethink this anyway; controlling, nosy mom and BF who plays along with her interest in your vagina. This is weird and creepy", "NTA, it is both of your responsibilities. It sucks being female with it because most can cause hormonal and other issues, I have tried virtually everything and it screws me up, but I am still trying with other things. Besides, that is your PRIVATE medical info that she has no right to if you don't want to share, and she should just be doing this with her son, making sure he is making good choices as well. While morning after pill is not great as your main form of birth control, it is the extra support and not bad to do. I was on birth control and we believed our condom broke, so I took a morning after pill, and look, not pregnant. No contraceptive is 100% guaranteed. If go back on the pill again, it would only be 90%-91% effective since my family has a history of blood clots .-.. Long story short, it is BOTH of your responsibilities, not just yours, and your mother has no right to demand that info and is a major AH for making the son try to do it for her", "She didn\u2019t offer because she was concerned. She offered because she wants to make VERY sure you don\u2019t give her grandkids and she\u2019d rather talk to you rather than ask her son if he uses condoms.

I\u2019ve been you (19, dating a guy, trying to figure out BC). If you\u2019re down to get an IUD, take her up on it or figure out if your insurance covers it (or if there\u2019s a low cost clinic that would do it). I get why his mom would be concerned but it\u2019s definitely on him to get her to back off. She doesn\u2019t need to know what pill you\u2019re on", "I can understand her being concerned about you getting pregnant, but she is placing all the responsibility of birth control on you, when your boyfriend equally shares that responsibility. NTA.", "Is he really worth it? Because this lady sounds like a GIANT red flag, and he clearly isn't standing up to her or for you. \n\nIn the meantime, can't you find some birth control pseudoscience to parrot at her? Like tell her you put thieves oil in your vag because Gweneth Paltrow said it was the best birth control. Or tell her you only do anal after the plan B scare. She wants to ask a personal question? She can get a personal (and false) answer, because this is none of her damn business. If she's so worried about her son knocking you up, she should make sure he's properly educated about sex and pregnancy, and then tell him to start wearing a condom every time. \n\nNTA.", "Tell her your sterile, and you only take birth control for the guys at work.\n\nthat will cool her down", "I\u2019m kind of torn on this one.. As a mother of a son, I have told him about condoms, stressed the multiple reasons they are important, reminded him that child support lasts till the kid is 18 at a minimum, and done my best to make sure that he has the knowledge he needs to make good choices. \n\nI have not, and never plan to, spoken to his gf about her options. I would hope that her mother has. \n\nBut if the topic comes up I will absolutely talk about IUDS vs the pill vs the shot. I don\u2019t think discussing the multiple options out there is a bad thing or a shameful thing, they exist. I think it would be rude to enquire what she uses, and wouldn\u2019t do that. But if a birth control add comes on I will happily discuss my own experience with the various types and they can take from that what information they will. \n\nI do know people who said they were on the pill when they were not and intentionally got pregnant while their boyfriend was thinking they were on the pill. I know people who have gotten pregnant while on the pill. It could be an experience that that mom has done or knows about that could be the basis of her concern- we all know someone or have experiences. \n\nGather your thoughts and then sit down with them both and have a conversation- let her know that you don\u2019t want to discuss birth control with her and that while you appreciate her concern you have your end handled and you would like it not to be brought up again.", "Hell, if you're dealing with a woman like this don't use that shot.  I had to go off it because it made me aggressive.  I had the urge to fight a trucker at a gas station.", "NTA\u2026 be up front with both her and your BF. It\u2019s none of her business, and he needs to get a spine. He at least needs to come around or this relationship is going to be over quickly.", "NAH. She has a right to be concerned considering your ages and that you had to resort to a Plan B. You have a right to be annoyed by her asking and embarrassed about someone you barely know up in your medical history. Your boyfriend is probably pretty annoyed as well and not happy to be talking about his sex life with his mom.\n\nThough Grandma is pretty suspect for searching the boyfriend\u2019s truck.", "ESH Both if you should be using at least 2 forms of contraception. His Mom is absolutely right to be concerned about a potential pregnancy.  Stop having sex unless you can be mature enough to understand the basic concept of why contraception should be used at all times.", "NTA x infinity. Your bf's mother is being massively inappropriate. Your contraception is your private business. You do not ask people about their private medical information or their sex lives. She was out of line ever speaking to you about it at all. This is not her business. It has nothing to do with her. And she's treating you horribly.", "NTA. She went too far. The only thing I can think of is her being concerned you\u2019re lying that you\u2019re on in and trying to figure out if her son has actually seen you take it? Maybe she or some of her friends lied about taking birth control to partners so she\u2019s paranoid?", " NTA.  You have a right to your personal boundaries, this your body and your choice.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't want to become a gramma right away she should teach her son to wrap up instead of bothering you", "NTA but I do just want to say there are options with the pill that mean you don't have to skip all periods, in fact where I am that isn't recommended as you have to take breaks when cued by your body regardless of continuous taking", "NTA, he is letting his mother control his sex life.\n\nDump him.  Date an actual adult who will take his own precautions.", "NTA. He's 19, too old for her to be \"letting\" him see anyone. And while the ninth degree *might* be a justified reaction as a conversation with HIM (depends a lot on stuff like how thorough she knows whatever version of the talk she gave him was or wasn't lol) her involvement with you doesn't need to be anything past maybe, due mainly to your age meaning you probably have less experience, noting at the end of that conversation WITH HIM that he should let you know that if you *want* help choosing an option/getting birth control/etc you can come to her if you want. She's way, way too aggressive about all this and seems like a busybody. You shouldn't need to tell her AGAIN not to talk about your body. She needs to leave you alone or your boyfriend needs to be the one to start shutting her down... or you need to dip from this relationship", "Vasectomies are 100% reversible. Why isn\u2019t his mother helping him get one?", "NTA\n\nIf she was trying to have an open and honest conversation with you that would be one thing, but it sounds like she didn\u2019t even allow you to talk about your feelings about the whole thing. Why would she not want to know your side of it?", "NTA - I\u2019d break the eff up with him on the basis of him mummy being a repeatedly intrusive cow.", "NTA as she is way too far in your business. But also I\u2019d be worrying about my son in her place. Tell her point blank that you have zero interest in being a mother at this point in your life and you will take the necessary precautions not to become one but that she is not your medical practitioner and you won\u2019t be answering further questions.", "NTA. Girl do you really want to deal with this man\u2019s overbearing,judgmental, snoopy mother for the rest of your relationship? It\u2019s wildly inappropriate that she\u2019s asking about your medical history and the fact that your bf doesn\u2019t see this as a HUGE problem is a problem in itself. \n\nNext time she corners you into a conversation you don\u2019t want to be had. Straight up look her in the eye and say it\u2019s absolutely none of her business and to mind hers.", "Talk to her son about condoms then. Her kid is her business. Other adults are not.", "I kinda agree but really she should be asking her son IF she has any reason to think she\u2019d be stuck helping out in the event of an unplanned pregnancy (such as having to house the new little family). Son should be able to state that they\u2019ve got it covered, end of convo.", "Thank you. I was worried I was the only one feeling this. I probably would have found the mom way to intrusive but OP\u2019s sporadic use of birth control and no mention of her boyfriend\u2019s use of condoms would make nervous as a parent.", "And also it doesn\u2019t sound like she was interrogating OP, but merely sharing some options. Let\u2019s be honest: birth control education isn\u2019t always great. It sounds like she wanted to make sure OP was aware of her options and OP is taking it very personally.", "She\u2019s also from a medical background, I think she was a nurse before a stay at home mom. So is his grandmother. I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s so open to talking about it and probably why she didn\u2019t take my feelings into consideration.", "I would agree with you except for the fact that OP said the mom didn\u2019t ask her why she wasn\u2019t  on the pill, what she was planning to do about it, or why she took plan b, and that she didn\u2019t care to know. That is not an open and productive conversation.

That\u2019s where she found it and then she also proceeded to call me the irresponsible one. When my boyfriend asked how I was irresponsible she couldn\u2019t provide an answer.", "Contraception is always used when I have sex. It\u2019s not about maturity but rather about me figuring out what birth control is right for me.", "Yeah, that\u2019s where I wanted to do more research concerning birth control.", "He did tell her afterwards that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with this and that he didn\u2019t want her talking to me about it anymore, because of the fight we had as a result of it.", "He does see it as a problem, but I think he really understood how fucked up it was once I told him how upset and degrading it made me feel that his mother was only concerned about my uterus, and not about me. I love my boyfriend, and he really does care, I think his mother has bosses him around so much that he doesn\u2019t know how to stand up to her which I think I can help with.", "IUDs can be painful if you haven't ever given birth. The offer comes from a good place, but it's a dick move to push the subject. \n\nI had one for years, from 17-19/20. It was awful. Eventually it started falling out. There's chances it can perforate your uterus, cause scarring, make someone infertile for life. Does his mother plan on footing the bill for any future complications and removal? Probably not. It's not a set it and forget it type thing. You have to check the string consistently and for some people it makes their periods worse and inconsistent. I got constant pain during sex from it, I had 2 partners tell me the string actually hurt them because I have a shallow vagina and the string would stick them in their pee hole. \n\nI had the mirena. I had a friend who got the kyleena because of how painful the mirena was for me. It ended up causing her to develop ovarian cysts. One day she was having sex, and bam, crippling pain, bent over, had to tell her mother and get rushed to the ER. The newer IUDs are smaller yes, but from everyone I've talked to, the side effects were not worth it. 2/5 people I knew with the kyleena developed ovarian cysts as teenagers. I knew 1 girl with the mirena like me, and she bled for 2 months after it, and it turns out they punctured her uterus and the scarring makes it so they predicted she will have a very hard time ever having children. \n\nIdgaf if it's her son, it's not her body, not her risks of er visits and additional costs and life long consequences. She can buy them condoms if it really keeps her up at night like that. \n\nThe only 4 birth controls with a consistent 99.99% protection rate, are the pill, an IUD, DEPO shot, and the nexplanon. Everything else has lower protection rates, including condoms. None of those 3 come without side effects. I have been on 3 of them. If you have history of mental illness, the depo is not a good option, or if you care about not getting really fat while on it. And you can't have it removed if it negatively affects you. \n\nBirth control is personal and the mother made her point, and now should fuck off about it and just talk about what precautions her son is taking, to her son.", "My boyfriend and I use condoms. She never asked me about the birth control in the first place and I was on anything.", "You\u2019re kidding, right? Do you really think two teenagers can afford a baby, a safe place to live, food, healthcare, formula, diapers, etc?\n\nAbsolutely the mom of this boyfriend would be paying. Probably OP\u2019s parents as well.", "Idk why people downvoted you, I agree lol. It\u2019s not her responsibility if I get pregnant, it\u2019s mine. I wouldn\u2019t put that burden on someone else. It\u2019s incredibly shitty to do.", "It sucks that she is not respecting your boundaries. I can understand both sides of this situation, but your comfort with the conversation trumps her concern about the ways you and your boyfriend are practicing safe sex. Send her an email that explains that you are taking every precaution, that you are not looking to have a baby now, but you will not be discussing the specifics of your medical choices with her, that is what your doctor is for.\n\nIf you and your boyfriend were to become pregnant and choose to have the baby, that is also your choice, and she doesn't get a say, except in choosing to continue to house your boyfriend, with or without rent.", "She probably didn't ask  because she was afraid you'd say you weren't using anything.\n\nAs embarrassing as it would be, probably the only thing to stop this is an actual sit-at-the-table-and-talk discussion. \n\nOr telling her that it isn't any of her business (make sure that you can say any resulting child is totally your responsibility and you are independently wealthy). Don't worry about being nervous or anything. She's just as nervous.\n\nNAH", "I mean chances are very good he\u2019s banging her in the moms house so I can see why she would be annoyed. Also odds are probably good this girl will end up pregnant but that\u2019s just my two cents.", "First OP, NTA. Second, he sounds like a mama's boy. I would be inclined to walk away from this relationship. He's not mature enough to clean up after himself! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Fuck that noise! Why are you automatically the irresponsible one?

But it sounds like she lectured you instead of having a conversation, but it's possible she was just not sure how to go about it and that made her awkward. \n\nIt is important to stay consistent with your birth control, I say this as someone who was not at your age as well and had some consequences for it. It only takes 1 slip up. Also keep in mind that antibiotics counter the pill. My nephew has an almost 2yo because his girlfriend didn't know that.\n\nIt seems like his mom wants what is best for you both. I hope you guys can navigate through this! Good luck!", "Not if she doesn't want to.  Not if op's parents don't want to.", "His mom is completely inappropriate. OP is an adult, as is her son. She needs to ask him what brand of condoms he's using and whether he uses them every time. OPs birth control is nunna her bidnuss", "Dawg.", "The only issue I have with that is that I want to be seen as an adult. I want to show her that I can make my own decisions and that im doing this because Im responsible.

Birth control can fail.", "Don't let people on here guilt-trip you into thinking that it is okay for this woman to coerce you or bully you into sharing with her your private medical information. She is clearly not a mother figure to you, and you are not by any means close to her. So why would you want to or feel comfortable discussing this with her? You have no reason to share the most private details about you body with almost strangers just because they are the relatives of your boyfriend.\n\nIf she thinks her son is immature and unlikely to be safe having sex, she can quiz him about using condoms all day everyday. But is this the kind of person you want to be in a relationship with?", "Adults use all tools in their toolboxes to navigate life. Including their parents when warranted. Sometimes you need to fight fire with fire and it sounds like your MIL doesn\u2019t respect you at all mainly because she refuses to see you. You standing up to her won\u2019t change it because she is too busy projecting her unresolved feelings about her teen pregnancy and insecurities on you. It also sounds like she has a less than stellar relationship with her son because she has difficulties choosing whether to be his parent or if she\u2019d prefer to only be his friend. \n\n\nYou\u2019re in a lose/lose situation with her. You\u2019ve told her your boundaries, she\u2019s trampled them a number of times. Unless you want her to think your boundaries don\u2019t matter to you, your only recourse is to dump your BF or otherwise just be nasty to her when she inserts herself, neither of which are great options for maintaining your relationship. But, were you to deploy your parents as a third option, you could stay with your boyfriend a bit longer (sounds like this relationship has a half life anyway unless he figures out how to cut the cord and grow a spine) and also get her to back off.", "Thank you. I don\u2019t have a relationship with his mother, nor do I really want one now if this is what it gets me. Meaning someone pushing my boundaries. I didn\u2019t want to diss someone who is obviously concerned for her son, but at the same time, I recognize it isn\u2019t fair what she did. I really appreciate your comment."]}
