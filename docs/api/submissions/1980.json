After that , years went by before I even spoke to my mother again. She always struggled with mental health and finances. She\u2019s struggled financially my entire life. She wants to move to the state that me and all of my sibling are in to be closer to us (her children). She asked me (her only daughter) , If she could stay with me until she got back on her feet. I live in a one bedroom apartment and even though my relationship with her has improved and I will love for her to be close. I don\u2019t want to be obligated to have her live with me.\n\nIt's absolutely not. When I read this I knew right away: \"She asked me (her only daughter) , If she could stay with me until she got back on her feet.\" Any woman recognizes what this is immediately, even if you don't.", "Totally agree. However, since he is trying to slough off this issue onto his daughter, I feel he needs to be the one to carry this burden. He\u2019s trying to be slick and he needs to be stopped.", "I\u2019m confused. From the post, it seemed like no and dad are not together and haven\u2019t been for over a decade? Why would this be dad\u2019s responsibility? (It\u2019s not OP\u2019s either, I\u2019m just confused about why it would be her father\u2019s)", "Oh families\u2026I\u2019ll give my pat answer to this situation, anyone who thinks you should help your mother out by giving her a place to live, or selfish not too, is welcome to give her a place live, with them.  Enjoy.", "Well since your dad suggested, maybe she can live with him temporary", "NTA, you have a lease, you are not allowed to have people not on the lease move in with you.", "I wouldn\u2019t go there about the money - because you just know that the siblings with kids are going to have a ready made excuse to throw that financial responsibility OP\u2019s way too.\n\nPlus what happens if OP\u2019s mother comes off her meds, and has episodes that cause trouble with her lease?", "I allowed my mentally ill mother to move in to our one-bedroom apartment \u201ctemporarily\u201d to help her get on her feet in a new state. \n\nWe could barely afford to feed ourselves \n\nShe stayed three months, refused to work for most of it, almost got us kicked out because we were not allowed to have another person living with us. \n\nShe only left when (unknown to me) my husband\u2019s grandmother confronted her and told her we couldn\u2019t afford to support her and to pack. \n\nShe flew out the next day. \n\nAdditionally, in later years, when we visited her at my grandparents\u2019 home back in the state she came from, she would go off her meds because she \u201cdidn\u2019t like how it felt\u201d when we were there. Very creepy, disturbing behavior ensued. \n\nWe stopped visiting. \n\nDo NOT allow her to live with you. Not even overnight.", "Then she would have to deal with what comes with that. As far as the rest having children.you are right they probably don't have the money. I was thinking about the places that are just for older adults that rent and utilities are income based.", "It\u2019s not even his responsibility either tbh. This is a grown grown woman!", "I recommended this to OP because her father is trying to take advantage of his daughter and that she should throw this onus back on him. Yes, it\u2019s true that the mother is none of their responsibility. However, with his crazy thinking, if he is suggesting that a family member should take her, the father is the likely choice for this future disaster. \n\nListen, we know what\u2019s going on here. The father is trying to railroad his daughter. It\u2019s not right and this should be thrown right back at him, say NO and turn off the phone.", "NTA. Your landlord probably wouldn\u2019t allow it anyway", "NTA, you have every right to say no, and if she doesn't accept the no gracefully the first time, she's not healthy enough for you to put energy into the relationship.", "NTA. You should not support your mother living with you if she intends to come off her medication. Think about yourself.", "And OP should think carefully about how long it's been since her mother was actually \"on her feet.\" Every relative or family friend I've ever known who has just wanted a little help until they get \"back on their feet\" was never really ever \"on their feet\" in the first place. I'm pretty sure they don't know how.", "You don't need their permission to say no.", "NTA\n\nIt's not \"temporary, when your Mom has pretty much never been \"on her feet\".  She has no job, no savings to live off of, and plans to be un-medicated.  She won't be able to pay for her own food not to mention help with rent and utilities.\n\nIf your Mom wants to move to your area, she needs to make her own living arrangements, pay for everything herself, and live in a non-family shared housing situation. \n\nIf you make the mistake of letting her move in, you will end up with a dependent who will cause drama and upend your life until you evict her.  If your family can't understand why you don't take her in, offer to tell Mom that said family member would love to welcome her into their home.  Hint:. They don't want her drama or expenses either.", "Run a mile from that and suggest she live with Dad. Say NO! This is not owed by you or deserved by her. NTA", "NTA - going off her meds and living with you? Yeah no way let her in!", "NTA and mom needs PROFESSIONAL help, nothing you could ever provide for her.", "Especially since mom wants to go off her medication.", "Unfortunately that happens alot in mental health. They either dont like the side effects or believe they don't need their medicine anymore and they'll be fine. But a majority of the time it's a vicious cycle of not taking, mental break, back on meds. Wash and repeat."]}
