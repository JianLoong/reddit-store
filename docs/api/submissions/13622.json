If she doesn\u2019t pick it up within 2 weeks, you\u2019ll consider it abandoned and you\u2019ll sell it.  That will give her notice that she needs to take care of it and what will happen if she does not.  If you give her this kind of notice with a reasonable amount of time, YWNBTA. You\u2019re not a storage facility, and even storage facilities sell abandoned property.", "while it's not yours to sell, she's not even responding to you so it would appear she doesn't care about it. i would try again to contact her, let her know that you don't appreciate being ignored, and if she's not gonna come get it, then you plan to sell it. but i think you really should do everything you can to get in touch with her. when was the last time you were in contact with her? is if it's been a long time is it possible this is not her # anymore?  NTA (unless you just sell it without trying to let her know about it)", "YWBTA if you don't warn her that you will get rid of it if she doesn't come to get it. After this warning, it is free game what you do with it.", "NTA. Give her one final chance though. \u2018If you don\u2019t pick it up by this date, its considered abandoned\u2019.", "I think if you send her one last message telling her to pick it up until X date or else you will sell it, then YWNBTA", "NTA- I would do a little research to cover your bases legally in case she turns around and tries to sue you for the value of the purse. Personally, I would avail myself of the free community law clinics that my city runs, or the one my local law school runs. They give free 10 minute consultations.", "YWNBTA - But you need to give her a final heads up message first. \"If you don't collect it by X date, it's considered mine and for me to do whatever with it\". Your house ain't free storage, its been YEARS.", "YWBTA if you dont inform your friend first. Who cares if you assume she doesn't care anymore, have some respect for your friend.", "I mean yeah if you just upped and sold her purse YWBTA, it\u2019s not yours to sell. \n\nTell her that you aren\u2019t willing to provide storage for the bag any more and give her a deadline of a few weeks, after which if she hasn\u2019t collected it you will get rid of it. Be clear that she doesn\u2019t have to take it home but she can\u2019t leave it at your house any more. Then she can either take it home, sell it herself or find alternative storage for it. If the deadline passes and she\u2019s still not done anything about it, after you\u2019ve warned her of the consequences, then you can sell it.", "NTA, but tell her, that you are going to sell it if she doesn't pick it up, so she has one final chance. It seems like she doesn't really care about the purse anyways.", "NTA, congratulations on your new purse.", "YWBTA. but I\u2019d still do it lol", "NTA. If you have made efforts to return it to her and it\u2019s been in your possession 30+ days legally it\u2019s abandoned property and becomes your property. Sell it and enjoy your friends $4000 idiocy.", "YWBTA unless you tell her you consider it your property and you're going to sell it and keep the money, and then give her a fair chance to respond. Otherwise you're stealing something you know belongs to her. \n\nIt seems strange she doesn't respond. Is there more going on?", "NTA *if* you warn her first, but will you be keeping the money, or giving it to her?", "NTAI would tell her I am Spring cleaning and selling/donating a bunch of items, including the purse  bu X date if she doesn't come get them. When she ignores you and the date passes, sell it and enjoy your nest egg.", "NTA- but it would be more interesting just to return it to her, at her house, while her BF is there\u2026", "Going to say NTA, as far as I'm concerned she abandoned it on your property, now it belongs to you. Though I would check local laws on abandoned goods before selling to make sure she no longer has a legal right to it before selling it.", "YWNBTA if you text her one last time saying she has until X to pick the bag up or you\u2019re getting rid of it.  Just to cover your own butt if she bitches about it.", "NTA. I\u2019d present her with a bill for storage costs.", "After 2+ years and good faith efforts to return it? NTA. \n\nHowever, (depending on how broke I am) I would tell the friend hey I'm cleaning up and found some more of your stuff. If you don't come get it, I'm getting rid of it. That way your conscience is a little clearer.", "NTA but check your states laws and give her \u2018you have x days to get this item\u2019 in writing\n\nOt just give it to her. \n\nEither way, is this a worthwhile friendship to you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don\u2019t take the bag by x date then I am going to sell it. That way she can\u2019t complain and say you didn\u2019t tell her / stole from her.\n\nAlso be sure to tell her twice. Once in person with other witnesses there and once via text so you have written evidence.", "so you say something and she literally just ignores what you've said and starts talking about something else? that is bizarre. i would really pressure her to answer you. if you have plans to see her, maybe bring the bag with you and plop it down in front of her. if she leaves without taking it, then it's yours to do with what you want. what a weirdo.", "Wait a sec is she still with her boyfriend? If so then it definitely explains why she doesn\u2019t want to take the bag. \n\nAnyhow I would advise that you send her a text that states that if the purse isn\u2019t taken by x time you will be selling it. Oh and something to note is that she will probably demand the money you get from selling her purse.", "That\u2019s your fuckin answer dude. She doesn\u2019t want the bag back. Sell it, throw it away, whatever. She likes her boyfriend more than the bag, so stop trying to reintroduce drama and break them up.\n\nThis is info you might want to put in the main post for clarity.", "yeah, at this point just sell it and enjoy the money, it's her own fault.", "NTA\n\nLeave it by her front door with a rose and a note saying \"I still love you.\"", "If she keeps ignoring you when you ask, you can ask her bf to pass on the message of what to do with the $4000 purse she left at your place years ago...

I've asked you a number of times to collect it, but you haven't done so, I now consider it abandoned and therefore my property. I'll be getting rid on it on 'date a week away' unless you collect it before then'.", "Tell her you\u2019re going to sell it if she doesn\u2019t pick it up within 30 days. Let\u2019s be honest it can\u2019t be taking up that much space. Seems like a money grab.

If she doesn\u2019t take it then I would put it in writing your convo to cover your butt", "So give her one final notice. Bold and underline the message. After that, all yours.", "INFO: text the owner, telling her you gave the bag to Goodwill. \n\nIf she flips out, tell her she can pick it up from your house in the next 24 hours. \n\nIf not, it\u2019s yours.", "One more fair chance to reclaim it and then consider it yours.", "Give her an ultimatum\u2026\u2026she has until \u201cdate\u201d to pick up the bag and then it\u2019s getting sold.

You're just trying to make money of it , instead of selling it,  the next time you guys plan on meeting , take the purse with you and give it to her .
