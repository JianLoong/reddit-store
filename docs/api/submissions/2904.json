You're a single mother who has sold her good possessions to care for her child. That sounds like the definition of a good mother to me.\n\nI hope that you have a reasonable court-ordered child support agreement since it seems that your ex is willing to begrudge even a dress.", "NTA. \n\nIt was your ex that asked you to attend his family gathering so that your shared child would be there. You didn't have the appropriate attire and initially told him no and told him if he wanted your daughter there so badly, he could pony up for a dress for an event for his family. That's fair.\n\nI think you have to have a conversation with him where you create clear boundaries for his gf and her opinions on the interactions between the two of you. I'm guessing that unless he cheated, she's a pretty new player on the scene. As such, she needs to butt out.", "We don't actually know if the dress was expensive. She didn't say that she demanded an expensive dress nor that he bought her one. That's just what his gf said.\nNTA. They wanted \"your\" presence and you had no means to be there, seems fair that he paid for it.\n\nEdit: the dress WAS expensive but the dude was the one choosing it. Not Op's problem", "NTA he demanded you be there you  didn't have anything to where you said buy me a dress and I'll go so he did. \n\nYou didn't force him you gave him a choice.", "NTA - you\u2019re a good mom (if I\u2019m reading the comments correctly that you sold all your nice clothing when you were pregnant for cash and you can\u2019t afford a nice dress and so couldn\u2019t go.) \n\nMaybe look into rent the runway or something for the future? (Much more affordable for crap like this), he can still pony up for it though but won\u2019t be nearly as bad. \n\nAlso this cousin seems to be on your side, I would make sure she knows the whole story (can\u2019t afford it, pawned all nice clothes for the kid etc.). She will spread the word to family members on your behalf. \n\nAs for the GF, jealousy is certainly an ugly trait. I would make it clear you want 0 contact with her and will only speak to Ex in future. What a shame, if the mother of my bfs child didn\u2019t have nice enough clothes while I wouldn\u2019t be running to be her bestie, I would want to help.", "NTA - If he was pushing for you to go and you needed something to wear. Unless you chose something really expensive because he was buying.", "NTA...They wanted the child to be there, which necessitated you being there.  You needed a dress, so he had to buy it.  People should have been a little more sensitive about you having to endure such an awkward situation.", "nta from this, but were the parents aware of the clothing situation prior? why didn't they offer to pay for a new dress?", "NTA! Although next time since it's the parents that want you to go then THEY should be buying you the dress. Save all the hassle. New GF sounds like a B.", "I see nothing wring here. You were invited, declined because you did not have the approriate attire/could not afford it. You voiced this and Ex still insisted. So at that point he was given a choice of letting it drop or paying for a dress that was approriate for the family event. He CHOSE to purchase the dress.\n\nIt's not like you bought the most expensive thing intentionally. Not like you demanded a wardrobe. The GF was just feeling some type of way. You were at a family function with the shared baby and her man bought you a pricey very nice dress. I wouldn't pay that girl any mind. His family being so judgey though is hurtful.\n\nI would thank the Cousin, and explain the situation to her. That way she knows you weren't lying ir anything. You don't want people to get in her ear with their lies.", "Nta\n\nI like his cousin. And why shouldn't, he or, whoever insisted you and daughter attend this function, buy you a dress? For goodness sake you just had a baby, your body is different. Nursing a baby and all. Because, you said the reason you were there is because you are nursing your baby.", "NTA.  But I probably would have skipped the event, in any case.  With your daughter still breastfeeding, she is probably too young to even understand or care what is going on.  However, you were perfectly right to ask him to buy you a proper outfit, if he insisted you attend.  Hope it was a nice dress!", "NTA.

I think it was a reasonable request. They invited you, it's not like you invited yourself. The new GF needs to stay out of it. The arrangements you have with your ex are officially none of her business.", "NTA- he didn\u2019t have to pick an expensive dress", "NTA - if the ex bf chose the expensive dress, which is what I read op said in the comment thread, then that\u2019s on him. \n\nIf OP would have chosen and requested an expensive dress, then I would say op is in the wrong, since she just needed a dress, not an expensive one. And it\u2019s not hard to shop for reasonably priced dresses. \n\nI would say tho, OP, that having a super nice dress isn\u2019t too important. You have no clothes at all? Making an effort for your son to be able to see grandparents in special occasions such as these is important for that kid. It\u2019s too bad your relationship with the ex didn\u2019t work, but now you share a kid and this ties you forever, so get used to making the effort to make sure the baby is exposed to both sides of the family. And you might already do this, but just making sure this is said because it is important for the child.", "NTA\n\nHis options were that you couldn\u2019t attend (and his child therefore also couldn\u2019t attend), or he could boy you a dress to suit the dress code so that you could attend (and his child could attend).

Does you ex just not get any visitation?", "YTA for insisting on an expensive dress.

Does he do his part in raising the child? Regardless, the girlfriend should have kept her trap shut. Not her business.", "ESH, though you the least.\n\nSticking to \"no\" would have been more appropriate if you were concerned about people making snide remarks. He has a new girlfriend, and you're at his parents' celebration - that's a perfect situation for people to talk about you and you must have known that. \n\nHe sucks because he wouldn't accept your answer of \"no,\" then agreed to get you a dress and chose an expensive one, then allowed his girlfriend to publicly (enough, if you heard it) insult you.\n\nHis parents suck because why would they put you in that situation? I understand your daughter is breastfeeding, but she could have attended only for a brief time, depending on your situation pumping could be a solution, or they could accept that their grandchild whose parents are not together was not going to make it. If baby is still breastfeeding, it seems your relationship to your ex and his new relationship can't have been *that* far apart in timing (at least, not several years). Of course his new girlfriend would feel insecure about your presence at a family event.", "She does need to butt out\u2026 but turns out she was right, it was an expensive dress.", "He didn't demand he asked so he can have there kid", "To be fair, most SOs are completely accepting and understanding of their partners exes.", "What does child support have to do with a fancy dress?", "Yes", "It's not usually that simple.

But OP, this is the kind of info that is important to write in your text. \n\nDid it have to be an expensive dress or did you just enjoy wringing him out for all you can get?\n\nI\u2019m gonna go with ESH here. If it was a time problem, than I\u2019m assuming you took time to pick out and try on what you wanted. If it was a money thing, you didn\u2019t have to go for expensive\u2026 you *chose* to. My guess is you chose to because you resent having to go to this thing. Fair enough, I too would resent it. But you guys are co-parents and these kinds of events where you both have to attend for the sake of your child will pop up\u2026 if you\u2019re the kind of person that will play games like this every time, than you\u2019re co-parenting will be mired in drama and unnecessary difficulty/conflict.
