If she wanted it to go to Kevin, then she should have legally willed it to Kevin. She didn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t want to give up your inheritance, there\u2019s no need to. Did Kevin know when contacting your mother that she was abusive to you?", "NTA\n\nKeep it.  You can always change your mind in whole or in part down the road, once the house has been sold.\n\nIf you give it up now, that's a decision you can't take back.\n\nWhatever you do, make whatever decision works for you.  Don't give in to pressure from people who just want to take your money away from you, even if it's for the benefit of someone else.  They are parasites, nothing more.", "NTA. If it was so important to your mother than Kevin got the house then she could have left a will. It\u2019s your house now. Sell it and do something with the profit to make your life easier. Take a vacation, buy a new house, add to a college fund for your daughter, splurge on a new car. Whatever makes you happy.", "NTA, if she didn\u2019t bother to make a will, this is the way it rolls. Sell the place, if you want to give some of the money to Kevin, do it, if you want to blow it on a vacation or just pay down your mortgage. Who cares what the rest of them think? None of them matter.", "NTA", "You WBTA if you gave it all away.\n\nCaveat: Are you otherwise rich? Like, what percentage of your net worth is this money?", "NTA\n\nIf your mother wanted Kevin to have the house, there would be something written (like, even a hand-written will) saying that Kevin gets the house.  There isn't anything, so your Mom must not have cared that much.\n\nBlock your family members who are harassing you.  Hire an attorney to help get the house into your name and the hire a realtor to sell it.  Take the money and use it to improve your finances.", "NTA\n\nYour mother could have had a will drawn up if she wanted Kevin to have the house. \n\nYou don't have to take the abuse you're getting from your aunts and cousins. You really don't have a reason to believe their claims about your mother's intentions. Block them.\n\nI would advise you either sell the house or rent it out through a property management company. Do not sign the house over to Kevin.", "NTA it's your house. If she wanted him to have it she should have willed it to him. This inheritance could do a lot of good for you, I understand your husband not wanting any part of it but that's not his decision to make. If it makes him feel better sell the damn thing, but don't give in to these people that have made your life a living hell, don't let them bully you into making your abuser's lives better at the expense of your own. They've taken enough from you.", "NTA if I was you, I'd sell it.  Hire someone to do the work for you so you never even have to go back there and see it.\n\nAlternatively you could donate the house to a charity organization, you do get a big tax write off for that, but that's only useful if you have taxes to be written off.\n\nIf you were in great financial shape I'd suggest that, but since your not selling it would be the smarter option.", "It's your house.", "NTA - if your mother really wanted your son to inherit and not you she would had made a will to make it happen.\n\nIt feel like you're more asking for advice. You shouldn't listen to people who obviously don't want your happiness quite the opposite. Why do you allow yourself to be disturbed by negatives comment from people you wouldn't ask nor want advice from?\n\nIt's understandable that you want nothing, or you can either see it as a financial compensation for past trauma, and current family heinous behavior, as you can use the money to offer your child some extra activity, set a college fund, finance some therapy for yourself, pamper yourself and husband.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
