But the really fancy, expensive ones cost in the hundreds of dollars, maybe even a  thousand if you want it really fancy. Needless to say, I couldn't justify the cost.

Well, my year came up just last week and I was able to save up a little over a thousand dollars and buy an amazing lightsaber from Vader's Vault.\n\nI told my girlfriend(30f) about it, and she got really angry at me. She said if I wanted a lightsaber I could have just gotten a cheaper one, and that spending a grand on a lightsaber is the most childish thing she's ever heard of. She said it's a selfish thing to do, especially since she needs a new car and was hoping I'd give her some help.\n\nI told her that it was my money, and that it wasn't like I blew an entire paycheck on it, I saved up for a year. She said the money could have been used for something far more necessary than a toy. We argued some more until she stormed off. Now she's giving me the cold shoulder and not talking to me.\n\nI mean it's not like we're struggling, living paycheck to paycheck.
