She is probably just taking out her frustration with him on you. Some women choose to stay even after stuff like this comes out then blame the other woman. Like you somehow should have known?", "I'm mixed. You did good by contacting the girl, but you probably did embarrass her by contacting her family and telling them that she is being made a fool of. So, I won't call you an a-hole, as I think you were trying to do the right thing, but it simply would have been better just to contact her.", "You let her know that the guy is cheating on you with her because of her money, and her response is \"Oh, I know, but I don't care. Your an asshole for telling me!\"\n\nNTA. You were trying to do the right thing.", "NTA...The messenger always gets blamed in the short-term.  The family are likely relieved and the woman herself will likely be as well at some point in the future. I'm also sorry that this whole situation happened to you--gross indeed.", "NTA\n\nIt's a difficult message, and she's obviously not going to be happy about it.\n\nBut you had exactly two options.  Remain silent, and facilitate his unethical behavior, both in his relationships and as an employee.  Or tell the truth, and let things play out.\n\nShe's not going to thank you for the truth, now.  But she wouldn't thank you for a lie, in the future, when the truth did come out.\n\nA lesson for you, as well.

The girl isn't the AH, either \u2014 your ex-partner is, though.\n\nIt's reasonable for the girl to feel mad and humiliated, and perhaps you should've just messaged her rather than her family.

I found out he has been in a serious relationship with someone else the past six months. I was SHOCKED. He was seeing me at least five times a week, getting hotel rooms with me, and at least twice a day. I was like how and why see me so often? He was seeing me after dates with her. \n\nI met up with him and I asked why not dump me? He said that her family has a lot of money. She pays for their dates. I was grossed out, he may of been sleeping with us both the same day. I would want to know. \n\nI messaged the girl and her family to let them know what was going on. The family was pissed. \n\nThe girl was mad at me for blowing up his spot. She said I humiliated her and I should of kept it a secret. She also said she didn\u2019t believe me. The family thanked me, but it left me confused. \n\nAITA for letting a girl know a guy is using her for money?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
