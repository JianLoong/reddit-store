Unless you truly think your friend did it to be a jerk on purpose, I am quite sure this has nothing to do with you. It is probably the day that work out best for many reasons. Family work schedules, travel, time to prepare, venue availability. She acknowledged she knew it was your bday. Maybe she wants you to know she knows, just so you don't think she totally forgot, but why should that whole day be out for her? \n\nThat said if you just want to spend your first bday as a mom at home with your newborn I think that's wonderful and you should not feel bad about missing her shower. Don't do it just to be petty because you think she's doing it intentionally to you.\n\nIf you know your friend best and she really is just planning this on your bday to make sure she steals some thunder from you or something, then that's not your friend but my personal experience is people are rarely malicious, we are all just the main characters of our own lives.", "I'm not sure about this one.

Tell her that you already have plans for your first birthday with your new baby. Then get her an extremely nice baby gift. If you can afford around $150, you can get a sterling silver baby spoon from Tiffany & Co. in that famous blue box.\n\nDon't laugh; I have gotten out of many a wedding by sending just a pair of champagne flutes in a Tiffany box, with no hard feelings resulting.\n\nThen offer to take her to a nice lunch at a very nice restaurant, or a spa day.", "NTA, you're gonna be tired (at minimum) with a new baby at 1 month, and that's IF everything goes as planned. If you have a c-section, you'll still be recovering.\n\nI would tell her gently that it's quite unlikely you won't be able to be there. Between your birthday being the same day and with the new baby, you are not sure what the day will hold for you. And if she says bring the baby, say I'd rather not bring her/him to events at such a young age.\n\nAt a later date IF it comes up in conversation you could mention that you felt her planning was inconsiderate considering how accomodating you have been to her, but by that time it'll probably be water under the bridge.

You're not required to go to her shower if you don't want to although I'd say a baby shower (assuming it's her first) is a bigger deal than a birthday that occurs every year.

As you get older, your birthday means less and less to people outside of your immediate family. You could easily just celebrate your birthday the day before or after.

But also you're kind of a petty AH for saying she's an AH for scheduling it that day. You're a adult, people don't revolve their planned events around you lol.

Especially that last couple lines you said \" I don't really want to have to please anyone else or worry about getting someone a baby gift on my birthday. I'm a little mad that she made it this day.\" Ick. You don't sound mature enough to be having your own kid. If this is a friend you love and a child you presumably will also love by extension, why are you only thinking of yourself? Don't go if you don't want to. But stop expecting the world to revolve around you as if it was \"your\" day and nothing else could occur that day.", "NTA had she planned this without knowing then that would be one thing but she has clearly arranged it deliberately for that time so that\u2019s on her", "NTA, but just talk to her about it if you're close friends. Tell her you're not sure you'll be able to make it as it's your birthday and who knows how you'll be feeling at that time with the baby arriving a month prior. See what she says. Her response will be pretty telling, I'd imagine.\n\nIt does sound a bit inconsiderate but maybe it was too hard to wrangle schedules for other people (eg: a mother or MIL). Even still she could have said sorry I can't seem to schedule it except on your birthday.", "NTA at all. You wouldn\u2019t even be in the wrong if you couldn\u2019t make a baby shower with a one month old at home and  it wasn\u2019t your birthday.

I don't think you're an AH for not wanting to go on your birthday, but that doesn't make her an AH either! Unless this event has the world's tiniest guest list, you are not the only person whose schedule she needed to consider when picking the date - calling her an AH for picking your birthday IS petty and unreasonable. You don't know what other constraints she was navigating, and these events are usually hosted by someone other than the expectant mother which adds layers of complexity.", "OP, your child won\u2019t have any vaccines yet and have a delicate immune system. I would not take them to a gathering of people you aren\u2019t familiar with, especially at the start of flu season. \n\nYou could leave them with dad, but that sounds like a poor birthday.

It can be a surprise...", "I guess I'm a little mad because for context, I have kept her in mind when planning my wedding, made my wedding a different date because it was her birthday, and attended her birthday lunch despite the fact that I was on holiday three hours away and left that family holiday early in the morning just to go to that lunch. I'm a little mad because she hasn't done the same for me I guess.", "Wow. She's definitely NTA. Her \"friend\" did that on purpose. She asked her when her bday was and planned it on that day after knowing that. I'm pretty sure she'll do this every single time she has something special happening.", "When she messaged a month ago, it seemed like she wasn't going to be planning it on that day. She made it seem like she would do it later. She never discussed with me beforehand that she was planning to do it on my birthday. I was under the impression that she wasn't so I didn't mention my birthday plans to her. I only found out today that the shower will be that day as she added me to a group chat and stated it would be that day.", "Ok, but supposed best friends usually do put thought into when each others birthdays are. At least in my experience. Especially if you want your best friend there. If I was inviting friends to something, I don't think I'd expect them to cancel their own bday plans. Pregnancy lasts 9 months and she chose her best friends bday less than a month postpartum. While I wouldn't say OP's friend is an asshole OP isn't either.", "I don't think so lol. I also hate parties and surprises \ud83d\ude02 my husband would know and he also thinks we shouldn't go because she knew when my birthday was yet didn't ask or give me a heads up that she would be planning it on this day.", "I'd say that consideration for a wedding is more likely to be worth it than a baby shower personally.  Sometimes weekends are busy and there may be other conflicts as well.  A wedding on someone's birthday means the anniversary also is, which means a life long date conflict.\n\nA baby shower is one and done, so a one time overlap is much less of a big deal.  Personally I don't think there's much right to be annoyed over this.  Maybe a bit sad or hurt but I'd ask about it first with the assumption they had a good reason.\n\nEven if they didn't, while that would be a little bit hurtful if you guys are really close otherwise, I wouldn't get too upset about it and honestly at that point I'd probably just celebrate my birthday on a different day.  For me at least, celebrating a birthday on a different day if I have something going on is just more convenient unless it's a big birthday.", "People have birthdays every day of the year. It\u2019s not necessary to schedule anything around people\u2019s birthday. No one owns a day on the calendar. \n\nI am asking honestly ... is it not possible to celebrate 2 things on one day? There are 16 hours for you to celebrate. What happens if 4 of those hours are celebrating something other than your birthday? Would that ruin your day? \n\nJust because you would do it a specific way doesn\u2019t not mean it\u2019s wrong if someone doesn\u2019t see it from your perspective. Your friend did nothing wrong.\n\neta \u2014 as an event planner I will add of the hundreds of events I plan every year 99% chance it will be someone\u2019s birthday. No one asks every guest at their event if it\u2019s their birthday. \n\nIf the best day to plan this shower happens to fall on your birthday but accommodates the host & the rest of her guests schedule...

She ain\u2019t no friend.", "Doing nice things for people should be done because you want to, not because you are expecting some kind of obligatory reciprocation from said person.

If the date works for everyone that\u2019s what you do. There could in fact be more than one person with a birthday on the day of this shower. OP can do what the rest of the world does when they have a conflict, decline the invite.\n\nThe shower is about the baby.... not OP.", "We have literally no idea why it was planned that day. For all we know the friend's mother could only make that day or the venue was booked and she couldn't have it any closer to her due date. Not to mention, *other people* usually do the planning for a baby shower and they maybe needed it that day. I could absolutely see the friend having asked so she could have something at the shower like a balloon and a cupcake or card specifically to celebrate the friend's birthday for a second during the shower.", "My SIL planned her baby shower just a few weeks after her own sister gave birth to her baby (both sisters got pregnant a month apart). Her sister lives in another city and made it clear she couldn't come - there were no hard feelings - her baby was only a few weeks old and my SIL understood that. \n\nIn your case, it's your birthday and your baby would be a month old. If you don't attend the baby shower - it's completely understandable. If she is really your best friend then she shouldn't take it to heart. NTA.", "I mean.. she is free to choose any date she wants. If you can't make it, you respond with a \"sorry can't come\".  People's lives don't have to revolve around others, maybe she had no other choices. It's a mother after you give birth, she can't predict what your condition will be - she can't put her life on hold for you. If it were a week after delivery, perhaps you would have thought \"i'm still recovering, how dare she not wait until i'm healed?!\" \n\nHave a good day with your family, send her a gift if you feel like it.

Is there ANY chance she's the kind of friend who would be planning on throwing you a mini surprise party at the same time as her shower? If she's that kind of person, I'd talk to her directly, ask her if there's anything going on, etc. Feel it out, & see how you feel.

However would it kill you to leave the baby with your husband for a couple of hours and attend the shower? Could be a nice break for you and give your husband some on on one time and then you can all do something later that day? Might be worth just stopping by for a little.", "It might be the only day possible for various reasons which may all be valid. If she's truly your best friend you should probably go though.

You don\u2019t have to go and very well may not be up to it 1 month postpartum. Enjoy your birthday with your family.

No one is wrong for saying no with plans and no one is wrong for not changing plans.", "NAH. A lot of people are involved with planning baby showes. A friends birthday is the last thing on the list when considering the date.

Invitations are not subpoenas. You are free to decline any, especially if you have other plans. 2. The world does not revolve around you. She knew she was risking you having other plans it being your birthday and all,  however, there were others she has to consider as well,  in particular,  when was the hostess or venue available.

You're probably not going to be in a hurry to do anything for that whole first month.\n\nAll you need to say is \"I'm sorry, I don't know if I'm going to be ready to attend an event. Can I get back to you later?\" And then a polite \"I'm sorry I can't make it, but send lots of pictures!\" If you're so worried about giving gifts on your bday, promise something later- you don't know what gifts others will give her, so it'll be a good opportunity to see what she needs after the shower.\n\nHonestly planning conflicts doesn't seem like it needs to be a big deal. She discussed it with you, when I read \"X is your birthday, right?\" Is sounded to me more like 1. She made plans on that day and was hoping she was wrong, or 2. She was hoping to do it on your birthday- maybe she wants to celebrate your new baby too.\n\nNot every version of this story is malicious and self-centered. Also, if I'm not wrong, you're mad but you're not telling her that there's a problem...? Communication should always be the first consideration. \"Is there not another day you could do it? I really want to go but I have my own plans that day\" is totally reasonable, and could tell you what her real intentions were by how she responds.\n\nBefore you say anything angry or pack this down into a lifelong grudge, I'd recommend thinking about if this is worth potentially damaging your relationship with her over. Is she constantly asking for these compromises? Do you have all the context? If not, then it could be worth just talking to her about it.\n\nIf you can't level with your friends I don't know why you would keep them around. I'd bet she's totally reasonable and open to discuss.

This is mean girl behavior.", "Like just having a baby less than a month before this? If she has a c-section she'll have a longer recovery than a normal birth.

I ended up having to plan my baby shower on the same day that my close friend\u2019s child turns two. It was the only option because I had to consider like 8 people\u2019s busy late summer schedules.

But that's just how I see them, I don't expect everyone else to feel the same way, but practically speaking that's their purpose. \n\nWeddings, parties, birthdays, even dinners, are different bc the expectation is different. We all know this but refuse to acknowledge it bc often times when people enforce a gift policy and come to AITA (or someone complaining on AITA about someone's gift policy) it's a majority opinion that it's extremely tacky to enforce gifts or a money entrance fee. You either have the money to have a wedding and invite people regardless of if they can make a gift or not, or you downsize your wedding to your budget as your guests are not entitled to fund a wedding.

The friend is only an asshole if she gets mad at OP for not attending.", "Cool!", "She wasn't even sure if it was her birthday. She had to ask because she cares so little. This doesn't sound like someone who is going to throw a surprise birthday party.", "If friend held the shower on another day that week OP is going to be just as exhausted and disinclined to expose her month old and not fully vaccinated baby to a crowd of new people...The point being either way she's not going to want to go so why worry if it is scheduled on the b-day", "No. She can't know that.\n\nEven if she has scheduled a c-section, she could go into labor tomorrow.", "Its oddly grating to have people forget that your kid could have been born before the scheduled date...", "Why is this grating? I\u2019m a pediatrician and there are plenty of emergency c-sections before a scheduled one. In fact, medical issues usually increase that risk. I\u2019m seriously asking so that I can understand moms better :)", "Sure, for a scheduled C or any scheduled induction.", "I hope that is true. Babies can decide to come early.", "I think it's uncharitable to assume malice without evidence. And sorry, there no evidence of malice here when she could have just as easily asked to *try* to schedule around OPs birthday and then *failed*. That she attempted to find another day and couldn't.", "Agree. It's a more tactful way of declining, rather than making it sound like she's trying to make the event about her (even though she has a right to be annoyed).", "This is what I was thinking when she asked to confirm her birthday, that she wants to bring out a little cake or something or even if it's a surprise birthday party for her and not a shower.", "There are probably unrelated reasons why she picked that date. It would be a bit narcissistic for OP to assume her friend scheduled a large group event just to spite her.", "I feel the same too. I\u2019m just naively optimistic and believe people are much better than they actually are. The most unfair part of it is if they\u2019re friends, would they not have the same friend circle, mutual friends and close to each others relatives? A baby shower can be thrown anytime, a birthday doesn\u2019t change. It would be shitty if plans for her birthday form closer to the date, even if it\u2019s friends and relatives coming over for pizza and cake, but are also invited to the baby shower. A lot of people these days have a hard time coming up with the funds for one gift and attend one event. If the baby shower is being scheduled for her birthday, that\u2019s just ick behaviour unless there\u2019s a genuine reason it needs to happen that day\u2026.", "\ud83d\ude33 yikes!! I bet you were so over being pregnant by then!!! I swear, the first 32 weeks were a breeze. I wasn\u2019t even really showing until I was 28 weeks. Week 38-43, I was miserable. The last 3 weeks of my pregnancy I gained 22 lbs of fluid alone from all my water retention \ud83e\udd74 I swear, I didn\u2019t even mind the child birth part. It\u2019s scary and painful but it\u2019s one day. If I could afford it and I didn\u2019t have to be pregnant, I would have had 10 kids!! Or at least 3 planned and a 4th that was an oops!", "I\u2019m not disagreeing that that happens. I\u2019m just saying (probably because I\u2019m in the thick of it in my 3rd trimester) that it\u2019s not new information for most women, and I\u2019m pretty tired of people essentially reminding me of my total lack of control or the potential for emergency or trauma when I\u2019m just trying to buy my groceries or figure out what we\u2019re doing for Thanksgiving. Like, assume I know *the* most basic facts about labor and don\u2019t argue with me about it.", "I had an induction scheduled for the Wednesday he turned 37 weeks old, at 8pm. It was scheduled 2 or 3 weeks in advance. \n\nSurprise! At 5am on the Wednesday that he turned 37 weeks old, my water broke and labor started naturally. \ud83d\ude05", "Lol this thread is literally exactly what I\u2019m talking about, though. I *know*. I\u2019ve been managing a high-risk pregnancy for eight months already\u2014 does anyone really think that they\u2019re going to be the first person to tell me that babies don\u2019t always come exactly when planned? Hearing exactly the same caveat every single time someone asks me when my baby is coming is precisely what\u2019s grating. It\u2019s like, reflexive for some people, and I have no idea why.", "A friend of mine had health issues when she was pregnant and figured she would have the baby prematurely. Her SIL had 6 kids and kept telling her she would be late since it was her first. Nope, he was born 2 months premature.", "People can end up hospitalized in the antepartum unit way before baby is here. I ended up stuck there at 33 weeks pregnant - and learned that other woman on the floor weren\u2019t due for 3 or 4 **MONTHS** later! (For context, I was due the first week of January, was hospitalized around Thanksgiving, had baby in mid December. Other women on the floor were due in MARCH and APRIL)\n\nHere\u2019s an example of someone who knew ahead of time that her baby would be premature: her water broke at 28 weeks pregnant. The hospital did something to hold off on labor as long as possible, while she stayed there to be monitored so they could jump into action. The baby was born at 31.5 weeks. So she knew the baby wasn\u2019t going to make it to 37 weeks (considered full term), but she didn\u2019t know when the time would be. \n\nWhen you get admitted to antepartum, a doctor and nurse from the NICU come meet with you to discuss the possibility of premature birth, what it means, and what the procedure will be if it happens.", "I know my baby is going to be premature because I\u2019m being induced at exactly 36 weeks, 1 week before full-term. As all of the other replies here have emphasized, it\u2019s also possible I could spontaneously go into labor earlier than that. Which is why I don\u2019t really love hearing those replies\u2014because it means thinking about a riskier birth and it\u2019s stressful for me without adding any useful information.", "Because it implies either that I don\u2019t know that babies don\u2019t always come on their due date, (which is pretty common knowledge) or requires me to share more information than I might want to about why I said that. It\u2019s just annoying when people assume you know absolutely nothing as a first-time parent. If a woman tells you her baby is going to be 4 weeks old on X date, why not just take her word for it? No one else has any data to the contrary, and no pregnant woman needs more people reminding her about potential birth emergencies she\u2019s not thinking about in that specific moment. Yes, things happen, can we all just assume that\u2019s implied when someone tells you their due date and move on? I\u2019m prepared to take that kind of caveat from a doctor, but not from random strangers or family members arguing with me about whether we\u2019ll be available for a family event.", "And only past that date, not before it.", "I'm amazed at how many grown adults want their birthday to be practically a national holiday, where the whole world is supposed to stop because \"it's MY birthday!\" \n\nOut of 8 billion ppl on the planet, you share a birthday with probably 22 million other people. At most your \"special day\" might matter to your spouse and your mom. Literally no one else cares.", "I see you, Anakin.", "Swollen labia would be a great band name.", "Having a shower on OPs birthday is always okay. When you're scheduling around 20-40 possible guests for something, you can't accommodate everyone and someone is going to rsvp no for some scheduling conflict (birthday, wedding, event, ect). As long as you respect that no, you aren't an asshole.", "Holy hell what is the average age of redditors on this page. All this main character syndrome. Your birthday is not that important.", "If she is her \"best friend\" then why is she confirming its her birthday? She should know its her birthday. Someone who isn't even sure seems unlikely to surprise her with a cake.", "Calling someone self centered is not saying how you feel, it's name calling. If the goal is to tank the friendship,  this is the way to do it.", "Iif intentions are pure as said above, I could agree, however, she cannot have surprise party for a grown woman, who is Nursing a Neonate. The whole evening has to be planned with a mother substitute and a home substitute.\n\n1. She may attend with plans to leave early, \n2. She may be under dressed as she doesnotwant to upstage friends baby shower, (She doesn't know the Surprise party for herself)\n3. She may feel less adequate or less prepared.\n\nWhy would she not spend her own Birthday serenely with her close immediate family, where somebody helps to look after the newborn as well.\n\nAlso, it is relevant if the surprise party is thrown by someone, who fully care and takes over the mothers role for that duration, a friend having her own shower, cannot do that, so there's no way, I am hoping to look on the bright side.\n\nAlso, being a women, unless you are Mother Teresa, no one wants anyone stealing attention and thunder from one's own self, be it BFF/ friend/ sister/ Mom etc..", "She was born 37 weeks, 4 days. 3lbs 8.2oz. She had very little amniotic fluid and was growth restricted. She is perfectly healthy and 11.5 now. She is maybe an inch or two shorter than I am.   \n\n\nThe second one was the one that REALLY made me SO done!!! I went into labor at 37 weeks exactly, the hospital, knowing my history and my itty-bitty baby history, wouldn't let me have her till 3 days later (went into labor on the 14th, she was FINALLY born after the hospital almost killed her on the 17th. We just celebrated her 10th birthday)", "Same (as in my own bday is 1/26 but my due date was 2/13). What an odd reddit coincidence.", "I hope the rest of your pregnancy goes exactly as planned. Best wishes for you and baby.", "I mean... it kind of is your own specific issue that hearing obvious and truthful information is stressful...", "Thank you for this detailed and well thought out answer :)))))", "For anyone old enough to be having a baby, though, they're old enough to accept that life is now about their children, not about them and their \"special day\".", "\"Your baby shower is not that important\"", "Idk, some people aren't that into birthdays or don't want to make a big deal out of them and some people are the opposite and they don't get the hint. My grandma hated having her birthday celebrated (she even lied about her birth year because she didn't want anyone knowing exactly how old she was). One year, my uncle told the waiter it was her birthday and they sang to her. And it wasn't just the singing, they stuck a hat on her and took a pictures. We never celebrated her birthday in a restaurant again.", "Yes, some of that is specific to the kind of pregnancy I\u2019m having. But hearing anything for the 3,000th time as if it\u2019s new information is annoying. Ask literally any pregnant woman whether they feel grateful or mostly feel stressed or annoyed by people explaining her own pregnancy to her. I\u2019m definitely not alone in that.", "As well babies have difficulties regulating their body temperature and dehydration is a real danger."]}
