Like most people say, an invite isn't a summons, you don't have to go.

Nah\u2026 probably not.\n\nJust tell her that you\u2019ll try to be there, but that you don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be possible. Leave it at that.

Unless you truly think your friend did it to be a jerk on purpose, I am quite sure this has nothing to do with you. It is probably the day that work out best for many reasons. Family work schedules, travel, time to prepare, venue availability. She acknowledged she knew it was your bday. Maybe she wants you to know she knows, just so you don't think she totally forgot, but why should that whole day be out for her? \n\nThat said if you just want to spend your first bday as a mom at home with your newborn I think that's wonderful and you should not feel bad about missing her shower. Don't do it just to be petty because you think she's doing it intentionally to you.\n\nIf you know your friend best and she really is just planning this on your bday to make sure she steals some thunder from you or something, then that's not your friend but my personal experience is people are rarely malicious, we are all just the main characters of our own lives.", "I'm not sure about this one. If it was me, I would drop by for a few hours and celebrate my birthday before or after since she is my best friend.

Only 1 month out, a long nap is probably the best gift, actually.", "NTA!!! This seems like a dig at you and you don\u2019t need to go along with it. Enjoy your day the way you want to, with a 1month old no rational person would get mad at you for skipping the event.", "NTA. I can see why you\u2019d be annoyed. She is your friend and even asked \u201cyour birthday is this day right?\u201d Even if she didn\u2019t purposefully plan it out that way, it definitely seems/feels like she did. So your feelings are totally valid. \n\nI see a lot of people saying that you are the AH because \u201ceveryone has birthdays\u201d while that\u2019s true, it can still make someone feel a type of way when their close friend plans something on their birthday, and kind of steals away the day. We are all humans and have feelings, so it\u2019s understandable you\u2019d feel that way. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to go, you don\u2019t even have to send a gift.

If she gets mad at you about it, that\u2019s her problem.", "Either I don't know what \"best friend\" means or YTA. It would take something really extreme to keep me from a celebration for my best friend. I wouldn't dream of skipping because it was my birthday that I didn't even really have plans for.", "NTA. Tell her that you already have plans for your first birthday with your new baby. Then get her an extremely nice baby gift. If you can afford around $150, you can get a sterling silver baby spoon from Tiffany & Co. in that famous blue box.\n\nDon't laugh; I have gotten out of many a wedding by sending just a pair of champagne flutes in a Tiffany box, with no hard feelings resulting.\n\nThen offer to take her to a nice lunch at a very nice restaurant, or a spa day.", "NTA, you're gonna be tired (at minimum) with a new baby at 1 month, and that's IF everything goes as planned. If you have a c-section, you'll still be recovering.\n\nI would tell her gently that it's quite unlikely you won't be able to be there. Between your birthday being the same day and with the new baby, you are not sure what the day will hold for you. And if she says bring the baby, say I'd rather not bring her/him to events at such a young age.\n\nAt a later date IF it comes up in conversation you could mention that you felt her planning was inconsiderate considering how accomodating you have been to her, but by that time it'll probably be water under the bridge. Decide if being upset by this is a productive use of your energy. I'm guessing not, assuming she takes the event decline without issue.\n\nCongrats on the new baby!", "NAH. You're being a bit dramatic about a birthday as a grown up. You're gonna have a lot of them,  time to relax. You're not required to go to her shower if you don't want to although I'd say a baby shower (assuming it's her first) is a bigger deal than a birthday that occurs every year. The comment about leaving holiday early to attend her birthday lunch is a bit weird. I would never expect a friend to do that.", "Baby shower are so lame", "NTA.

As you get older, your birthday means less and less to people outside of your immediate family. You could easily just celebrate your birthday the day before or after. It will be your one chance to attend this baby\u2019s shower. I would think about if this friend ship is that important to you. If it is then I would go. If not then blow it off and do whatever.", "If your \"friend\" knew it was your birthday and purposely planned it that way, she's the ahole. If friend didn't know it was your birthday, just send a gift or card. Either way, enjoy your day. You are not an ahole.", "INFO: Is it at all possible she might be planning to do something \u201cfor your birthday\u201d at the shower? \n\nNTA either way, but I was curious. \nDef make a plan with your husband that you guys \u201chave plans\u201d that day even if the plan is it veg on the couch doing nothing . \n\n But if he knows about any surprises,  he might want you \u201cto go to the shower\u201d \u2026 so make sure to keep him in the loop for yourself incase somehow there is a chance like this. Maybe it\u2019s just my wishful thinking/naivety", "NTA because you're not obligated to go to a baby shower 1 month postpartum. But also you're kind of a petty AH for saying she's an AH for scheduling it that day. You're a adult, people don't revolve their planned events around you lol. Maybe she asked so she could give you a card or something when you came. Especially that last couple lines you said \" I don't really want to have to please anyone else or worry about getting someone a baby gift on my birthday. I'm a little mad that she made it this day.\" Ick. You don't sound mature enough to be having your own kid. If this is a friend you love and a child you presumably will also love by extension, why are you only thinking of yourself? Don't go if you don't want to. But stop expecting the world to revolve around you as if it was \"your\" day and nothing else could occur that day.", "NTA had she planned this without knowing then that would be one thing but she has clearly arranged it deliberately for that time so that\u2019s on her", "NTA, but just talk to her about it if you're close friends. Tell her you're not sure you'll be able to make it as it's your birthday and who knows how you'll be feeling at that time with the baby arriving a month prior. See what she says. Her response will be pretty telling, I'd imagine.\n\nIt does sound a bit inconsiderate but maybe it was too hard to wrangle schedules for other people (eg: a mother or MIL). Even still she could have said sorry I can't seem to schedule it except on your birthday.", "NTA at all. You wouldn\u2019t even be in the wrong if you couldn\u2019t make a baby shower with a one month old at home and  it wasn\u2019t your birthday. She\u2019s TA for asking you if it was your birthday and then scheduling her shower then.", "It seems so unlikely to me that she would actually plan her babyshower on your bday. Maybe its actually going to be a surprise bday party for you?", "NTA just tell her it is too soon to commit as you will have a new baby and won\u2019t know how you will feel.", "Why is this even a question? You can do whatever you want, its your bday and you will have a new born. If she doesn\u2019t understand that then she is TA\nNTA", "NAH.  I don't think you're an AH for not wanting to go on your birthday, but that doesn't make her an AH either! Unless this event has the world's tiniest guest list, you are not the only person whose schedule she needed to consider when picking the date - calling her an AH for picking your birthday IS petty and unreasonable. You don't know what other constraints she was navigating, and these events are usually hosted by someone other than the expectant mother which adds layers of complexity.", "OP, your child won\u2019t have any vaccines yet and have a delicate immune system. I would not take them to a gathering of people you aren\u2019t familiar with, especially at the start of flu season. \n\nYou could leave them with dad, but that sounds like a poor birthday. And almost impossible if you choose to EBF. \n\nAlso, if you end up having a c section, you may still be incredibly uncomfortable standing and sitting for periods of time AND not be able to drive at 4 weeks PP.", "No need to let the husband know. It can be a surprise...", "I guess I'm a little mad because for context, I have kept her in mind when planning my wedding, made my wedding a different date because it was her birthday, and attended her birthday lunch despite the fact that I was on holiday three hours away and left that family holiday early in the morning just to go to that lunch. I'm a little mad because she hasn't done the same for me I guess.", "Wow. She's definitely NTA. Her \"friend\" did that on purpose. She asked her when her bday was and planned it on that day after knowing that. I'm pretty sure she'll do this every single time she has something special happening.", "When she messaged a month ago, it seemed like she wasn't going to be planning it on that day. She made it seem like she would do it later. She never discussed with me beforehand that she was planning to do it on my birthday. I was under the impression that she wasn't so I didn't mention my birthday plans to her. I only found out today that the shower will be that day as she added me to a group chat and stated it would be that day.", "Ok, but supposed best friends usually do put thought into when each others birthdays are. At least in my experience. Especially if you want your best friend there. If I was inviting friends to something, I don't think I'd expect them to cancel their own bday plans. Pregnancy lasts 9 months and she chose her best friends bday less than a month postpartum. While I wouldn't say OP's friend is an asshole OP isn't either.", "I don't think so lol. I also hate parties and surprises \ud83d\ude02 my husband would know and he also thinks we shouldn't go because she knew when my birthday was yet didn't ask or give me a heads up that she would be planning it on this day.", "I'd say that consideration for a wedding is more likely to be worth it than a baby shower personally.  Sometimes weekends are busy and there may be other conflicts as well.  A wedding on someone's birthday means the anniversary also is, which means a life long date conflict.\n\nA baby shower is one and done, so a one time overlap is much less of a big deal.  Personally I don't think there's much right to be annoyed over this.  Maybe a bit sad or hurt but I'd ask about it first with the assumption they had a good reason.\n\nEven if they didn't, while that would be a little bit hurtful if you guys are really close otherwise, I wouldn't get too upset about it and honestly at that point I'd probably just celebrate my birthday on a different day.  For me at least, celebrating a birthday on a different day if I have something going on is just more convenient unless it's a big birthday.", "People have birthdays every day of the year. It\u2019s not necessary to schedule anything around people\u2019s birthday. No one owns a day on the calendar. \n\nI am asking honestly ... is it not possible to celebrate 2 things on one day? There are 16 hours for you to celebrate. What happens if 4 of those hours are celebrating something other than your birthday? Would that ruin your day? \n\nJust because you would do it a specific way doesn\u2019t not mean it\u2019s wrong if someone doesn\u2019t see it from your perspective. Your friend did nothing wrong.\n\neta \u2014 as an event planner I will add of the hundreds of events I plan every year 99% chance it will be someone\u2019s birthday. No one asks every guest at their event if it\u2019s their birthday. \n\nIf the best day to plan this shower happens to fall on your birthday but accommodates the host & the rest of her guests schedule... I would advise your friend to plan it. You can choose what you want to do on that day. No one will force you to attend. You can prioritize yourself & your birthday, that\u2019s perfectly fine.", "Based on this comment. She ain\u2019t no friend.", "Doing nice things for people should be done because you want to, not because you are expecting some kind of obligatory reciprocation from said person. It's not a transaction. If you don't feel she is an equal friend, then drop the rope. Stop expecting that you'll get anything in return.", "Well course she planned her event on purpose. If the date works for everyone that\u2019s what you do. There could in fact be more than one person with a birthday on the day of this shower. OP can do what the rest of the world does when they have a conflict, decline the invite.\n\nThe shower is about the baby.... not OP.", "We have literally no idea why it was planned that day. For all we know the friend's mother could only make that day or the venue was booked and she couldn't have it any closer to her due date. Not to mention, *other people* usually do the planning for a baby shower and they maybe needed it that day. I could absolutely see the friend having asked so she could have something at the shower like a balloon and a cupcake or card specifically to celebrate the friend's birthday for a second during the shower."]}
