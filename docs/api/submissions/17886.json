With a razor??\n\nThat's living on the God damn edge.", "NTA whatsoever. You've warned him not to and he keeps taking it anyway. It's a personal use item and perfectly reasonable for any normal human to assume a razor can be used anywhere. It's a good lesson for him to learn.\n\nMy main question is why does he keep running out of his own. Either your parents need to ensure he has a supply or he needs to find a job. You said that he runs out of other things too like shampoo. It's a basic necessity to provide for a minor. Either he needs to take responsibility for himself or his parents need to step up and provide", "NTA \n\nNot only does he not respect your boundaries, but it is also well known that women's products are more costly than the same products marketed for men.

Hopefully the asshole comment will be enough that he actually learns, it isn't a huge deal that he uses your stuff every once in a while (given that he uses a miniscule amount and pays for it if he uses more than a bit every like 5months) but it sounds like he's dependant on your items being stocked which is just bad management on his part. Also he should obviously ask to use your stuff.", "I wouldn\u2019t feel guilt, I\u2019ve been yelling at my brother for 10 years about using my belongings or breaking it, and he doesn\u2019t let up.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise lol.", "Nta, and that is very annoying that your parents are defending him but not teaching him that he needs to let them know if he needs more stuff.

It's your stuff; he shouldn't be messing with things that are not his. At 16 years old, he absolutely should know better. He probably does know better - he just doesn't care because he's lazy and knows that your parents will let him get away with it. Definitely start hiding your toiletries.", "NTA. I mean, screaming at someone is never an effective form of communication. But if you buy your own products, its up to you what you do with them. You can shave your anus or your vagina or your armpits or your chest hair. You can use your toothbrush to brush your teeth, or clean your toenails, or to brush your eyebrows. Theyre yours to use as you see fit. Its really no ones business what you do with any of it. If anyone else doesnt like it, they can get their own stuff...

I know that people say women are from Venus & men are from Mars, but it sure seems like your brother is from Uranus.", "NTA. I went through the exact same nonsense with my brother for years until I moved out. Worst part is he would use up the entire product, won\u2019t tell you and leave the empty bottle in the shower for you to find.

Maybe he should know what he\u2019s using.", "NTA and the darkside in you is strong", "NTA. I can see why he keeps doing it though - your parents basically enables him. Their behaviour tells him it's okay to breach all your boundaries.", "**NTA**\n\nhahaha Fuck about and find out. He was told, repeatedly, not to use it. He wen't out of his way to breach your privacy and use your stuff. The fact that you shave your nethers with it IS HIS FUCKING PROBLEM. Crude or not is irrelevant. Maybe your parents should start putting boundaries in place for him. Sure it sounds like you reacted strongly but this was not the first time and he had many opportunites to respect your stuff.", "NTA - it's a life lesson for him to not steal and use other people's things that's not his own.", "16 is definitely old enough to be more responsible than he\u2019s being. Also at 16, there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cin a pinch\u201d and \u201cneeding\u201d to shave. He\u2019s only doing it because it bothers you. You are definitely NTA", " NTA why aren\u2019t your parents buying him his own stuff?", "Oh my god this made me laugh!!!!  NTA.  Brilliant solution!!", "NTA. Your parents need to understand it isn\u2019t the razor head that\u2019s the issue. It\u2019s the constantly using your stuff", "Lmao, NTA.

Siblings always do.", "NTA\nKeep this energy if you have children. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to get my kid to stop eating the canned whipped cream from the fridge. Ten years later, he still leaves that one alone.", "Its tough love.  God, the shit my brother did to me, this seems tame.  \n\nIt's pretty hilarious, he will be sure to think again before he uses that razor \ud83e\udd23 and your family, he will get over it pretty quick.", "NAH \n\nJust because your parents should be providing him with personal hygiene supplies and not let it get to the point where he has to use yours because there's nothing else he can use", "So your parents have no problem with him snooping through your stuff and stealing. You've already asked him not to do this. It was hopefully a teachable moment. NTA", "NTA - Fuck around and find out lmfao", "NTA, hilarious as hell!", "NTA. As an older sister I feel you so much.

I used to be the younger sibling that stole everything from my sisters and it wasn't until I got older and had to pay for my own shit that I realized how upsetting it was to have someone use your personal shit. \n\n**Just a suggestion, because I'm a parent, and he clearly needs this:** maybe take him shopping for his own bath essentials, show him stuff that would be better formulated for his skin and hair. Get him his own shaving shit. Or if money is an issue, maybe ask your parents to pay for his \"dollar shave club\" subscription. \n\nHis parents should be doing this, but since they apparently aren't, I'd just do him a favor and teach him this life skill.

Maybe he'll learn not to so readily disregard your right to your own things.", "NTA. You\u2019re right to be angry. Your brother keeps stealing your stuff and disrespecting your boundaries. Furthermore, your parents are deflecting the issue of your brothers improper behavior to your comment because it is easier to blame you than to acknowledge that your younger brother is lazy, irresponsible and disrespectful. They are all in the wrong. Quite honestly, they all deserved the comment, and your brother absolutely was served up a dish of karma. If he wouldn\u2019t have purposely looked for your stuff with intent to use it without permission he would not have been put in the position to shave his face with your razor that\u2019s been in your private areas. Maybe he\u2019ll think twice next time. Maybe this will help him to learn to be a little more responsible and proactive about keeping his own products around. But don\u2019t count on it. \n\nWhile it\u2019s not fair, the only way to truly prevent him from stealing your things is to keep them locked up in a lock box in the bathroom or in your bedroom.

And your parents need to step up and ask your brother for his shopping list and buy your brother\u2019s toiletries for him.", "NTA. He keeps ignoring your wishes for very reasonable boundaries, and has done nothing to think ahead for when he gets in a pinch.

It's also a massive liberty to use someone else's anything without asking. It's not like he can say that he thought you'd be OK with it, is it? It's worth pointing out to your parents that your brother's loose attitude to other people's property is far more in need of addressing than you stating which bits of your body you shave.

I'm glad you brought up the fact that you shave your asshole with it to him. Hopefully he learns his lesson by then.\n\nAnd honestly? Valid reaction.
