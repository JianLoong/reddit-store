No matter how much I yell at him, when he\u2019s in a pinch and just trying to go fast and has run out of stuff, he just uses mine. I usually hide all of it under my sink, but I generally keep my razor in the shower. The first time, I thought it was an accident. I always put the plastic covering back on my razor, and found that the next time I went to use it, it had been removed. I just told him it was mine and not to do it again. Just in case though, I removed the old head, and put the new one i had just used to shave my entire body in my drawer in the bathroom, so the next time I would shower I could just grab it from there. \n\nThe second time, I got pissed. He literally went to use my razor, found there was no head, and then went through my bathroom stuff to find another razor head, replaced it, and then used it to shave. I found out and lost my shit. I screamed at him that I literally used that to shave my asshole and he used it on his face. He got mad because I replaced the plastic on the razor head and put it in my drawer with other new razors that I had bought so he assumed it was new. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to use mine but he was in a pinch again and just searched around for what he thought was a clean razor head to use so he wouldn\u2019t use my used one like last time. He also freaked out about the asshole thing and was like gagging and crying about it. I just told him he shouldn\u2019t have used my stuff after I specifically told him not to. My parents are mad at me because I was \u201ccrude\u201d and that I didn\u2019t have to say all the asshole stuff. They are also saying my reaction was disproportionate and that I shouldn\u2019t have reacted so much because it WAS and honest mistake and he thought it wasn\u2019t used. I did get pretty mad, like screaming at him that he was gross and has no respect or boundaries. I kind of feel bad because he\u2019s not talking to me now.

Also, can\u2019t you get infections like folliculitis from someone using your razor? Not cool of him to keep doing it.", "NTA. Your parents are just enabling his behavior. I'd put the stuff in a locked drawer or locked box. He intentionally went through your stuff to get your razer. That's not an accident.", "nta! use all your products on your asshole and let everyone know, problem solved!", "NTA perfect sibling-level revenge", "Lol that is hilarious NTA too", "NTA\n\nyou asked nicely and he ignored you then he went searching through your stuff to do it again so I wouldn't say your reaction was disproportionate at all. Baby boy needs to learn that No means No. On the plus side, he's not likely to use your razor again", "NTA. Hilarious. Hope your brother learned his lesson.\n\nI'm no expert, and I may be wrong, but isn't sharing of razors a way that some disease can be transferred? \n\nIs there a doctor in the house?", "NTA, it's not an \"honest mistake\" when he's constantly doing it after being told not to. Sounds like he got the wake-up call he needed though. Side note, how does he not have his own razor if he's used to shaving? And why was he going so far out of his way to use your razor to the point that he rifled through your stuff to get a new razor head?", "omg that's awesome lol.  nta.  i bet he will never forget that", "Tell ya bro he got verbal diarrhoea and you can see shit on his chin every time he talks crap for the rest of ya life .  Maybe ask him if his used ya mum's shaver as well and in front of ya mother . I'll probably ask him if he farted every time he talks and say it's like ya can smell shit talking .", "Ah! The grand meeting of two assholes!\n\nNTA", "NTA. \"An honest mistake\"? That might apply to the first time he used your stuff without asking, but there's nothing \"honest\" about doing it again and again.\n\nGood for you. Maybe he'll learn not to touch stuff that's not his from now on.", "NTA. This is the best post I\u2019ve read so far LOL. You have every right to set boundaries with your stuff.", "NTA, that's hilarious. I am glad he thought you shaved your AH (and other body parts) with it. It served him right.", "NTA and hopefully he learns a lesson about not using other people's things", ">it was an honest mistake \n\nNo. No, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nHe knows not to use your stuff. Telling him off doesn\u2019t work because there\u2019s never any comeback. The asshole thing _might_ help, but i wouldn\u2019t count on it. Next time, hide your stuff better, except for _one_ shower gel or shampoo into which you\u2019ve mixed some green food colouring or similar.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
