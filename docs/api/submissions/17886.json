With a razor??\n\nThat's living on the God damn edge.", "NTA whatsoever. You've warned him not to and he keeps taking it anyway. It's a personal use item and perfectly reasonable for any normal human to assume a razor can be used anywhere. It's a good lesson for him to learn.\n\nMy main question is why does he keep running out of his own. Either your parents need to ensure he has a supply or he needs to find a job. You said that he runs out of other things too like shampoo. It's a basic necessity to provide for a minor. Either he needs to take responsibility for himself or his parents need to step up and provide", "NTA \n\nNot only does he not respect your boundaries, but it is also well known that women's products are more costly than the same products marketed for men.

Hopefully the asshole comment will be enough that he actually learns, it isn't a huge deal that he uses your stuff every once in a while (given that he uses a miniscule amount and pays for it if he uses more than a bit every like 5months) but it sounds like he's dependant on your items being stocked which is just bad management on his part. Also he should obviously ask to use your stuff.", "I wouldn\u2019t feel guilt, I\u2019ve been yelling at my brother for 10 years about using my belongings or breaking it, and he doesn\u2019t let up.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise lol.", "Nta, and that is very annoying that your parents are defending him but not teaching him that he needs to let them know if he needs more stuff.

It's your stuff; he shouldn't be messing with things that are not his. At 16 years old, he absolutely should know better. He probably does know better - he just doesn't care because he's lazy and knows that your parents will let him get away with it. Definitely start hiding your toiletries.", "NTA. I mean, screaming at someone is never an effective form of communication. But if you buy your own products, its up to you what you do with them. You can shave your anus or your vagina or your armpits or your chest hair. You can use your toothbrush to brush your teeth, or clean your toenails, or to brush your eyebrows. Theyre yours to use as you see fit. Its really no ones business what you do with any of it. If anyone else doesnt like it, they can get their own stuff...

I know that people say women are from Venus & men are from Mars, but it sure seems like your brother is from Uranus.", "NTA. I went through the exact same nonsense with my brother for years until I moved out. Worst part is he would use up the entire product, won\u2019t tell you and leave the empty bottle in the shower for you to find.

Maybe he should know what he\u2019s using.", "NTA and the darkside in you is strong", "NTA. I can see why he keeps doing it though - your parents basically enables him. Their behaviour tells him it's okay to breach all your boundaries.", "**NTA**\n\nhahaha Fuck about and find out. He was told, repeatedly, not to use it. He wen't out of his way to breach your privacy and use your stuff. The fact that you shave your nethers with it IS HIS FUCKING PROBLEM. Crude or not is irrelevant. Maybe your parents should start putting boundaries in place for him. Sure it sounds like you reacted strongly but this was not the first time and he had many opportunites to respect your stuff.", "NTA - it's a life lesson for him to not steal and use other people's things that's not his own.", "16 is definitely old enough to be more responsible than he\u2019s being. Also at 16, there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cin a pinch\u201d and \u201cneeding\u201d to shave. He\u2019s only doing it because it bothers you. You are definitely NTA", " NTA why aren\u2019t your parents buying him his own stuff?", "Oh my god this made me laugh!!!!  NTA.  Brilliant solution!!", "NTA. Your parents need to understand it isn\u2019t the razor head that\u2019s the issue. It\u2019s the constantly using your stuff", "Lmao, NTA.

Siblings always do.", "NTA\nKeep this energy if you have children. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to get my kid to stop eating the canned whipped cream from the fridge. Ten years later, he still leaves that one alone.", "Its tough love.  God, the shit my brother did to me, this seems tame.  \n\nIt's pretty hilarious, he will be sure to think again before he uses that razor \ud83e\udd23 and your family, he will get over it pretty quick.", "NAH \n\nJust because your parents should be providing him with personal hygiene supplies and not let it get to the point where he has to use yours because there's nothing else he can use", "So your parents have no problem with him snooping through your stuff and stealing. You've already asked him not to do this. It was hopefully a teachable moment. NTA", "NTA - Fuck around and find out lmfao", "NTA, hilarious as hell!", "NTA. As an older sister I feel you so much.

That\u2019s why they are mad cause you told him what you used that one for ? I\u2019m sure if you didn\u2019t say that he would\u2019ve continued to do so! Why do people never just ask? Asking for a razor head to use while ur in a pinch is a better way to get what you need rather then just using it!", "NTA. Not at all. My brother once told me how the beard trimmers in my bathroom did a really good job. I had to tell him they were for my downstairs trimming - his face was priceless! You're absolutely not the asshole!", ">My parents are mad at me because I was \u201ccrude\u201d and that I didn\u2019t have to say all the asshole stuff\n\nNTA your parents are enabling your brother's bad behavior", "NTA\n\nDude had it coming!

Hope he finally learned after this!", "NTA. 16 years old and he has the constant need to shave? He's the AH... Literally lmao.\n\nPlus, he needs to understand that these type of things are PERSONAL for a reason. You can get deseases for using personal stuff like this. No offense but your parents are AH as well for allowing this behavior. \n\n\"Honest mistake\" mah a$$.", "NTA. He's learnt a lesson. Doesn't matter if he thought it was new, used or worn out. It's yours, not his to use.", "NTA.\n\nHe never respected your boundaries, so that\u2019s a way to learn when to start. \nThough it obviously won\u2019t happen since mommy and daddy don\u2019t see nothing wrong with what he is doing.", "\u201cAITA for using a razor my sister shaved her butthole with?\u201d", "NTA - clearly it was the only thing that really got through to him.

Aside from being rude, it's very unsafe to use someone else's razor.", "Hahaha \ud83e\udd23 NTA and you should have laughed confidently at his misfortune. He will find out the hard way. I suggest putting mayonnaise in your shampoo bottle and swap things around so that he's can't use your stuff and won't know that is in each one. You can leave out blunt razors in the shower so he uses them and it's no problem. Keep your stuff locked in a vanity case. I have to do that with my stuff in a shared flat sometimes so I just take my toiletry bag to the shower and it opens up and hangs outside the shower door. You told him the truth! Or it could potentially be the truth, it's fooking hilarious.", "NTA I laughed so hard for this story thank you", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't a misunderstanding, you had repeatedly told him to not use your stuff and never said not to use my used stuff.\n\nAs far as being crude, who cares hopefully it makes your point hit harder.", "NTA- your parents should buy his own razor and I\u2019m laughing so hard reading this!", "Nta.

Absolutely hilarious, and should teach him a lesson", "NTA I've said off the wall stuff to my brother to get him to leave my shit alone too. Especially when I was a teen and he was a 5 year old lol.

MRSA, for example, can be triggered (not sure if this is correct wording) by sharing razors. Not to mention your parents failing you and your brother.

At this point I don't think he will ever stop so you may have to start locking away all your products. \n\nEither way don't feel bad. How many times do you need to tell him no before it sinks in?

The whole him thinking it was a new blade doesn't make it any fucking better! Like \"here I'll just dig around a see what brother has since I can't get my own\".
