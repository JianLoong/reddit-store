Just in case though, I removed the old head, and put the new one i had just used to shave my entire body in my drawer in the bathroom, so the next time I would shower I could just grab it from there. \n\nThe second time, I got pissed. He literally went to use my razor, found there was no head, and then went through my bathroom stuff to find another razor head, replaced it, and then used it to shave. I found out and lost my shit. I screamed at him that I literally used that to shave my asshole and he used it on his face. He got mad because I replaced the plastic on the razor head and put it in my drawer with other new razors that I had bought so he assumed it was new. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to use mine but he was in a pinch again and just searched around for what he thought was a clean razor head to use so he wouldn\u2019t use my used one like last time. He also freaked out about the asshole thing and was like gagging and crying about it. I just told him he shouldn\u2019t have used my stuff after I specifically told him not to. My parents are mad at me because I was \u201ccrude\u201d and that I didn\u2019t have to say all the asshole stuff. They are also saying my reaction was disproportionate and that I shouldn\u2019t have reacted so much because it WAS and honest mistake and he thought it wasn\u2019t used.

Point the first: don't touch someone else's stuff. Point the second: why wouldn't he assume that's what you're using your razors for and avoid them? Shaved genitals is the in trend right now, is he dumb? Point the third: women's razor's do an awful job on facial hair, has your dad taught him nothing?", "NTA. 1. boundaries are healthy.  2. Your brother needs to get his shit together and get his own shaving stuff wth dude 3. Your crudeness served a very helpful and effective purpose. He doesn\u2019t know what you do with it so let\u2019s emphasize the boundaries of what that could be. \n\nAs for your parents, I\u2019d use the term \u201casshole razor\u201d around them as a joke twice annually henceforth", "NTA parents also like to stand up for the youngest one. Because they think the older one have an unfair advantage.", "NTA. It's your razor, what's it to them where you shave. Sounds like a standard sibling battle, your parents are just making it worse", "It was a new one for YOU to use, not him. NTA at all. Your brother is acting entitled and your parents are encouraging it. He has his own stuff but is actively seeking out yours to the point where you have to hide it. That\u2019s frustrating and messed up and shouldn\u2019t be happening. I hope he enjoys having butthole all over his face", "NTA: The way that parents show favoritism towards boys is nauseating and I say that as a man.", "NTA. He\u2019s consistently taking your stuff it wasn\u2019t an accident when he went in your room to grab your razor head. Sharing razors is not good too so I would definitely say that to get him to stop. Plus it\u2019s funny", "NTA\n\nThis made me laugh. A point needed to be made.\n\nHey, parents. The point is he's using my stuff, not that he used the wrong part of my stuff. Nothing is more annoying than living with someone who doesn't plan ahead and then your stuff is gone because you did and it was handy.\n\nAt sixteen who is doing the shopping? They need to step it up.", "NTA\n\nSome might say this would be an overreaction but if you have some extra money, get a lock box that is big enough to fit your products and start carrying the key with you.", "NTA. I just laughed so much I up woke my dog. Brother is a slow learner.", "Be a real perv. Tell him that is the razor you use to shave your MOM'S asshole.", "NTA, said the exact same thing to my brother when he kept using my razor for his face when we were teens. He definitely never used it again so hopefully your brother won\u2019t either! \ud83e\udd23", "Nope. NTA. Boundaries are meant to be expected. What did your brother think you were using the razor for anyway?!", "Hilarious. This is not even petty.\n\nNTA", "We all forget to stock up on something that's running low once in a while, that is a honest mistake.

It was intentional and everybody knows it.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t an honest mistake. He raided your toiletries for items to use. He used a razor. It stands to reason that we\u2019re not supposed to share razors, toothbrushes, body trimmers, etc. That is on him! He can enjoy his well deserved case of BootyFace.\n\nWhat\u2019s crude about the truth? It\u2019s yours. You used the razor to shave your own body.

And that's true even if you don't cut yourself. Shaving creates microscopic openings in the skin, which allow organisms to enter and spread infection. And, although they're usually spread by direct contact, the viruses that cause herpes and hepatitis can also linger on razor blades or in the moist areas between blades.", "Totally agree!
