Yesterday he told me that he has found a potential tenant and they will be surveying the apartment today at 2pm. I agreed. Around 1:40 PM, he texted me saying the people will be a bit late. I said okay. Around 2:20PM he told me they will be coming around 3-3:10 PM. I told him i can wait but they need to make the visit short since I\u2019m going out at 3.30PM and forsure will not have them surveying the house without me there. He said okay. \n\nAround 3:15PM i texted him to see if they are coming. No answer. 3:30 PM i called him and he did not pickup. I sent him a text saying that i have to go out due to my dental appointment and he need to reschedule the meeting. He did not reply. \n\n\nAround 30 mins later, I received a call from my neighbour that there was some random guys entering my apartment. I rushed home (the clinic was just 2 blocks away from my apartment) and found out that the owner has entered the apartment using his copy of the keys. I was furious. I told him off. He told me that he has right as owner to enter the house whenever he want (yes it was stated in the contract). I called his bullshit and told the people he brought over if this is the kind of landlord they are expecting. Landlord that has no respect over the tenant privacy/security. The people apologized and left. The landlord slammed the door on my face and left as well. \n\nJust now i got a text from him asking me to apologize for what i said to him. Apparently he will hold my deposit until i apologized.

You gave him so much leeway in the time and he couldn't respect your privacy whatsoever, I would want to know my landlord is like this before I signed a lease. That being said, with money involved it may be worth apologising just to take the easy ride out. NTA though.", "NTA and consider taking him to small claims if he withholds your deposit. Most states have laws as to what a deposit can be deducted for if not already stated in the lease. I doubt being honest about your renting experience is limited by your lease.", "NTA, you are absolutely right.\nAnd I would keep everything in writing.\nNo deposit because no excuse from your part, I'm sure it will work in court!", "Nope, NTA. Also, not sure what state you live in but look up the states renter laws - they may overpower rules your landlord gives.", "NTA\n\nConsult a lawyer right now, pretty sure that your landlord can't legally hold your deposit until you apologize.", "NTA. Its just fair warning.", "NTA \n\nIt's insane that landlords in the USA are allowed to keep a copy of the keys. Really that only give problems.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Small claims is where you take landlord if he refuses to return your deposit. Be sure and take videos and photos of the apartment to document the condition you left it in.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. He already lost that tenant.\n\nBut, is your pride more important than your money? I'd apologize (it doesn't have to be sincere, it's just words), get the deposit back, and leave as soon as your lease expires. You can tell him to go fuck himself while leaving.", "If the OP's actions result in the landlord not being able to move someone in immediately, he can deduct it from the lease.   The OP was given notice that the landlord would be showing the place that afternoon.  He didn't need her presence or permission to proceed.", "Bad advice.   The lease says the landlord can enter the premises and he gave them notice that he would be doing so for viewing.   If they do anything that delays his being able to rent it as soon as they move out, he can keep the deposit.", "Landlord needed to provide an accurate time of entry. He cannot keep the deposit because he went against his own notice.", "Actually, he doesn't.   Attempting to show the place when they were there was a courtesy, not a requirement.  He gave the tenant notice and told  OP the prospective renters were running late and they *assumed* that the viewing was off.   That was wrong and if the OP continues to behave that way, the landlord can claim that they made it impossible to secure a replacement in a timely manner."]}
