Viewings are usually one of the reasons landlords are legally entitled to enter.", "But it sounds like the landlord did give almost 24 hours notice (unless the arrangements were made at night the day before).  Landlord is an idiot for withholding a deposit for this situation, but OP is an AH for how they handled the landlord showing the apartment. I want and need privacy, and would be pissed if they were late too. BUT, with notice, the landlord has every right to show the place to prospective new renters. ESH", "I'm not aware of a country where they aren't allowed to keep a copy of the keys. It's usually standard practice if they need to enter in an emergency. When they are allowed to enter is usually tightly regulated.", "In the UK we're keyholders for our landlord neighbour because as part of her license to rent to students someone local has to hold the key for emergencies.", "Are they in the USA? In Canada the landlord gets a set of keys as well. In case of emergency, when you're not home etc...", "Of course they have a key. What if a pipe bursts when a tenant is on vacation? They have to get into the unit in an emergency.", " Landlords absolutely have keys. They have to protect their investments. Sadly not all tenants are clean or bill rent. Plus emergencies happen. Some apartments have quarterly inspections too. All that said they are required to give 24-48 hrs notice and give you a chance to be there.", "Username does not fit.", "So this is not entirely true depending on where you live. \n\nIn my area, the landlord or manager is able to give 24 hour notice to enter a unit. If the landlord does not make this appointed time (most notices give a few hours time frame) then they again have to give notice for another date. They can't just wily nilly show up whenever they please outside of the appointed time frame.\n\nNow onto this issue, if you give a 24 hour notice and the tenant is not there you can still enter a unit without them if you are there in the time frame. HOWEVER, you cannot have anyone other than management, maintenence, or contractors in the unit without the tenant being there. Period. This is because if someone without official business regarding the unit in things like repairs or inspections enters and either breaks or steals something, then it is on the landlord or the management company to hope they don't get majorly sued. Not only that, it is a huge privacy breach as well. Imagine if you live in a complex and the manager brings in another tenant to your unit to help with something. That tenant could then relay anything about your home or even scout where things are and how to grab em. \n\nSo no, you cannot just bring potential renters into an occupied living space without consent. If you miss the time or the potential renters are late, you reschedule. It's not the current tenants fault they \"lost out on moving someone in immediately\"\n\nNot only that, you don't just snap your fingers and someone is moved in giving you money.

I was responding to a post that implied the OP legally had the upper-hand and was pointing out that wasn't necessarily true.", "That doesn't mean it was 24 hours.", "Oh my word, I HOPE you aren't a landlord because I fear for your bank account if you are. Landlords are REQUIRED to give a FULL 24 hour notice, in writing. If you say that you will be showing the apartment at 3:00 Friday, then that's how long the notice lasts for. After 3:00, the notice laps and you have to give a new notice. And you can't just break into a tenants apartment either. And the security deposit is ONLY to cover PHYSICAL DAMAGE to the apartment. Try telling a judge you kept someone's security deposit because they hurt your feelings and you'll be lucky if the judge only makes you pay back triple of the security deposit."]}
