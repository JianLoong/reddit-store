Lease agreements generally state that during a period (say 30 or 45 days) prior to the end of the lease, the landlord has the right to show the place to prospective tenants. It may specify that visits cannot occur before x:00 am or after y:00 pm. or that current tenant must be given advance notice of at least x hours.... Not sure if your lease specifies that you must be home at the time. Depending on your lease terms, the landlord may have had the right to show the place without you there.\n2. There are generally laws that apply to the return of deposit. In my state, the law requires a landlord to return the security deposit within 30 days (of the lease end and receiving the address where your deposit should be sent), with a full accounting of any amounts withheld. If the landlord does not do that, s/he may be sued for treble the amount of the deposit that was not properly returned in time. (Though suing the landlord can be a pain in the butt.). You will want to have a signed walkthrough paper (signed copies for both you and the landlord) indicating any damages found for which some of the deposit may be kept. Hang onto that signed document.\n\nMy husband had a shady apartment company (1) not return the deposit or provide any accounting within the required time (they claimed they were holding it for other reasons) and (2) pretty aggressively demand more money 11 months later for supposed damages. The apartment folks had added stuff to the walkthrough form after it had been completed and signed by both parties. We had my husband's signed walkthrough form showing none of those extra damages. That's when we learned about the treble damages the apartment people would have to pay my husband. They sure changed their tune once we pointed that out and the fact that they had illegally altered the walkthrough form after-the-fact.", "NTA.

You don\u2019t know who the hell he might be letting prowl around your place.", "I had a landlord try to keep my 1000$ cash deposit.  First he tried to say I didn\u2019t pay it but I reminded him there were three witnesses.\n\nThen when we moved out, he tried to say I did damage to the house.  So I sent him itemized lists for the repairs I had done (stripped and repainted bathroom, repaired cabinets, bought and installed and paid the electrician for installing the dryer.\n\nThen I reminded him that since the Taiwanese landlady was living illegally in the basement they\u2019d asked me not to apply for social services or she would lose 1200$ a month of her income.  So I deprived myself of income for this woman. So I asked if they would reimburse me the back pay I would have gotten\u2014around 24000 over the two years.\n\nThat 1K showed up in my account within twenty minutes.\n\nKeep your receipts, baby.  And the day you give notice, assume your landlord will try to screw you.  Better safe than sorry.", "First of all, NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond of all, no lease or contract supercedes your basic legal tennant's rights. Get in touch with a lawyer ASAP for sure. There are plenty of organizations that help get tennants in touch with legal representation, often for low or no cost.", "YTA If the contract says anytime, that means anytime. Don't sign contracts you won't follow. If you cost him tenants by refusing to follow the lease agreement he can possibly keep your deposit.", "How does this comment have so many upvotes? \n\nIt is *ILLEGAL* for a landlord to withhold any deposit without actual grounds for the deposit being used.\n\nA *damage* deposit is in place incase any DAMAGE occurs, hurt fee-fees aren\u2019t included in this policy.", "That has nothing to do with what I said, though. Landlords are still required to come within the time frame for which they've given 24hr notice, and if something comes up it's their responsibility to reissue a new notice. They cannot enter at a time for which they have not given notice unless there is an immediate emergency, no matter who is required to be present.", "Unless he has proof that you damaged his property he can not withhold your deposit, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re American or Canadian but if you\u2019re Canadian I know we have a place you can report that type of behaviour from landlords", "Don\u2019t apologise, take photos and videos of the clean un-damaged apartment (take photos and videos of literally every nook and cranny) and make sure you write down the date and time of those as well as the date and time you hand back the keys. I\u2019d also get your neighbour/s to come check out the apartment just before you leave so they can vouch for you in court if he claims to hold your deposit for \u201cproperty damage\u201d. If he actually withholds your deposit then take him to small claims court, take the evidence that everything was left in fantastic condition and have written, signed and dated witness letters from your neighbour/s to prove it as well. This just saves you if he caused damage and fakes allegations that you did it and that\u2019s why he kept the deposit. Also take a screenshot of the threat he sent via msg and take that to the court hearing as well!", "NTA and make sure you SAVE all the texts from the landlord.  This is called EVIDENCE!", "He can't hold it for an apology (in the US). \n\nBut OP refused to follow the terms of the contract. Landlord might be an ass, but the contract rules all.\n\nIf those people refuse to rent, and the apartment sits empty after OP moves out, the landlord might hold the deposit and say it's for rent on the vacant apartment. OP can sue, but depending the state/country that can be very difficult; many red states have terrible renter protections*. If OP loses in court they'll likely get stuck with the landlord's attorney fees **and** any rent above/beyond what the deposit covered. \n\n*Tennessee recently passed a law that if a tenant wants to fight an eviction notice they must turn over 12 months of rent, in a lump sum, before they can sue. This pretty much eliminates renters ever being able to fight an eviction."]}
