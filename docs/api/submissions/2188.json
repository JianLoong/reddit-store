I would honestly respond to his text with, \u201cIf you decide to hold my deposit for illegal reasons, expect a call from my lawyer.\u201d Also, DOCUMENT everything! Document when the prospective new tenants were supposed to come. Take screenshots of the calls and texts where you tried to communicate and received nothing back. Document the call your neighbors made to you and even specifically what you said and what happened when you got home. Make sure to take time/date stamped pictures of the condition you leave the home in when you leave, too, so he can\u2019t try to say he\u2019s keeping the deposit because you left it in shambles. Sounds like this guy has a couple screws loose, so you\u2019ll want to CYA. (Cover your ass)\n\nETA: one way to document is to send everything to yourself via email. It\u2019s date and time stamped. And definitely screenshot his text where he says he\u2019s keeping your deposit if you don\u2019t apologize. :)", "Nta and that\u2019s literally illegal.", "Not a real estate expert, but I think the following is generally the case:\n\n1. Lease agreements generally state that during a period (say 30 or 45 days) prior to the end of the lease, the landlord has the right to show the place to prospective tenants. It may specify that visits cannot occur before x:00 am or after y:00 pm. or that current tenant must be given advance notice of at least x hours.... Not sure if your lease specifies that you must be home at the time. Depending on your lease terms, the landlord may have had the right to show the place without you there.\n2. There are generally laws that apply to the return of deposit. In my state, the law requires a landlord to return the security deposit within 30 days (of the lease end and receiving the address where your deposit should be sent), with a full accounting of any amounts withheld. If the landlord does not do that, s/he may be sued for treble the amount of the deposit that was not properly returned in time. (Though suing the landlord can be a pain in the butt.). You will want to have a signed walkthrough paper (signed copies for both you and the landlord) indicating any damages found for which some of the deposit may be kept. Hang onto that signed document.\n\nMy husband had a shady apartment company (1) not return the deposit or provide any accounting within the required time (they claimed they were holding it for other reasons) and (2) pretty aggressively demand more money 11 months later for supposed damages. The apartment folks had added stuff to the walkthrough form after it had been completed and signed by both parties. We had my husband's signed walkthrough form showing none of those extra damages. That's when we learned about the treble damages the apartment people would have to pay my husband. They sure changed their tune once we pointed that out and the fact that they had illegally altered the walkthrough form after-the-fact.", "NTA.  If you are moving really soon, apologize and leave with your deposit. Just go LC with him until the end. If this was a long-term rental thing, then you should act differently, but since there is no long-term commitment, I would advise you to let it go.", "NTA\n\n>Just now i got a text from him asking me to apologize for what i said to him. Apparently he will hold my deposit until i apologized\n\nThe correct response to this is \"My lawyer will appreciate that you put that in writing.\"", "NTA.  He can't withhold your security deposit in lieu of an apology.  But I do hope you took pictures when you moved in and take pics when you move out so he can't make up 'damages' to legally keep your deposit.\n\nBTW, in most rental contracts landlord has to give you 24 hour notice but they are most certainly entitled to enter the property, with or without you there, if they have given proper notice.", "NTA at all. Maybe next time even hand the prospective tenants a note about it discretely! (I did this after a similar situation) he deserves it.", "Yes he has the right to enter the house, but you have to give consent on the time and date in which this happens and he has to give you 24 hrs notice at least. He did not come at the agreed upon time and he can only enter the home without your consent during an emergency. Therefore he has violated your right to privacy. Nta", "I don\u2019t know- I would be fairly annoyed in this situation  but I don\u2019t think he is completely in the wrong. It seems like he gave you adequate required notice (24 hours?) and if it says in the contract he is allowed to enter at any time then he is allowed to enter at any time.", "It\u2019s illegal to withhold security deposits for any reason besides damage to the property", "Landlords cannot enter whenever they want they have to give notice if they intend to come around and it must be agreed.

In winter, it was almost impossible to stay warm because the furnace was an apartment model and not meant to be in a crawlspace either! In the year I lived there I discovered that every door and window was drafty to the point of feeling a breeze all the time. And the worst part\u2026I had a little slip of paper slide off an end table and slip right through where the floor and wall meet! WTF!?! I took another full sheet of paper and was able to slide it along half in/half out of that little crevasse ALL THE WAY AROUND THE LIVING ROOM. I have no clue how that floor was even being supported!?\n\nWhen it was time for me to move, I made sure I was there any time someone came to look, so I could show them my little trick with the paper. He still didn\u2019t have a tenant by the time I left.", "YTA", "NTA. If he is threatening to hold your deposit over hurt feelings, it\u2019s unlikely you were ever going to get it back to begin with.

And that does not typically include strangers/people not connected with the property.", "NTA - luckily this idiot has provided written proof that he is unlawfully holding your deposit.\n\nThat should be very helpful.", "in usa the rule is they need to put in writing 24 hours before any visit.  but they can get in if they follow procedure.  he broke in illegally", "NTA\n\nFrom how it reads, he was specifically delaying things waiting for you to leave before he brought in people to view the place. Rearranged multiple times at short notice on the same day, it seems each time he gave you a new time was really your landlord checking if you were still in the house or not. \n\nAnd he waited for you to leave and went in immediately. He wasn't expecting you back. \n\nFor the deposit, make a paper trail now, text or email about it and refuse to talk in person or on the phone for any reason. Make sure its written down. Either his confirmation he is sending it to you or his refusal based on an apology. \n\nYou then have a case against him. If you go to court you can get 3x the deposit amount back, it might take you a few months, but it'll sting him. You'll have a judgement against him and if he refused to pay you can engage bailiffs/collection agencies who'll chase him for you.", "NTA.  You gave them permission to tour while you were home.  You specifically said they would need to reschedule because you had to go out for your appt.  While a landlord can enter without you there with notice, this was not the agreement you had with him. \n\n He can't hold your deposit for an apology but make sure you heavily document the state of the apartment when you move out.  Make sure there are dates and timestamps so he can't say he's holding it over damage.", "NTA. Save the texts threatening to withhold your deposit.

I\u2019ve have screen captured the text and will bring it into court and show the judge when I take you to small claims for refusing to return my deposit. I am also document all your unwanted encounters, it is not legal for landlord to come in whenever they want, it must be under specific limited circumstances.", "He said he would hold your deposit until you apologize and was dumb enough to put it in writing?

He gave notice that he was coming in, he came in, OP freaked out. \n\nFor the YTA because the landlord didn\u2019t break any laws. You might not like how the law works, but that\u2019s not the issue.

Technically, LL can sue T if they refuse access for maintenance (never happens because too expensive and not worth it) but they can't evict them. The notorious Section 8 doesn't list this as one of the reasons for eviction.

It was a rental tour.", "That depends on where you are, where I live they have to give 14 days notice before entering unless it's an emergency like a fire or a water leak.
