He got up and started going through some crisis. He asked me if I\u2019m seriously judging the guys on the pics before anything else and I said hell yeah.

Well as soon as he heard the word creepy he accused me of using \u201cslurs\u201d against him and making him look bad.

He was looking over your shoulder watching you on your phone. In a way, that\u2019s like watching someone write in their diary. Phones are very personal and have become an extension of ourselves, that is like reading your thoughts.\n\nAlso, maybe he is having a hard time dating. I won\u2019t go so far to say he\u2019s jealous and he wants you, but it\u2019s a possibility. He might physically relate to the guys you swiped left on and was hurt that maybe that is what is happening to him.", "Creepy is not a slur and is definitely not equivalent to any real slur. That is super weird of him to look into your phone and critique you on who you show interest in. Like you don't need to give every guy a chance and if you're not attracted to someone then don't.", "NTA - None of his business.", "NTA.  Your friend sounds like a lunatic.  No one is entitled your time and affection, including randos on a dating app.", "NTA your friend has some unresolved issues and is projecting that on you. Its weird and gross over stepping. You're not an asshole for being picky.", "NTA. You are a full grown woman who can make her own decisions about who you choose to date and how you find someone. If you prefer just looking at pictures, then go right ahead.", "NTA. He was being creepy, watching your choices like a hawk and then getting bent that you\u2019re not matching with strangers on a dating app? Honestly, wtf? \n\nWomen do not owe men our time or attention. Period. You owe nothing to strangers on a dating app, you have no obligation to be interested in them. You are entitled to use the app however the fuck you want. \n\nYour friend is being a controlling misogynistic creep and he can fuck right off with that nonsense.", "NTA. If your friend did the same with women on a dating app, he'd have an argument as to why it was okay, I'd bet. (Hint: it's 100% fine, because he, too, has the right to decide who he does and does not talk to. Wild, I know!) Anyway, this guy is a weirdo. You're just fine.", "It's non of his business to dictate your taste in men, he's jusy salty af and jealous that you have high standard and he probabaly realized that you would swipe left on him too lmao", "NTA. He\u2019s insecure and projecting it onto your dating app", "NTA, sounds like he's been called creepy before.", "NTA, guy sounds like an incel. I mean, he could be happily dating, but it does still feel like he's got some resentment against women being free to choose and have standards, too. When I was single, there was this acquaintance who constantly talked smack about me because he thought I was too picky. Eventually people in our peer group froze him out because (a) he was already married, so why care? and (b) when I began going out with my partner, he then began saying that \"of course, he HAS to be a hot doctor\" or some bizarre version of \"why is 'fine' not acceptable to you?\" \n\nUgh. I'm feeling gross just from talking about it.", "Your friend isn't your friend. He's into you,  and he's pissed off that he's been \"friend-zoned.\" Ditch him.\n\nYou're NTA", "NTA. Tell him to spend less time on Reddit. I pity him, but more so the women he'll harass in his desperation. =(", "Your friend seems like a crazy MRA WRA incel. You are NTA.", "NTA you\u2019re allowed to swipe whoever you want for whatever reason\u2026 and spying on someone\u2019s phone honestly IS fairly creepy. It\u2019s not a slur, and to compare it to one bad enough you have to censor it is totally TA move of all of it!", "NTA..\n\nThis guy has secretly liked you and threw a fit that instead of looking to him, you\u2019re using a dating app.. He is in fact the one being creepy and can\u2019t stand that you called him out on his crap\u2026", "NTA. He seems like he's projecting. Creepy is not a slur, and I cannot even fathom what he thinks it's similar to. You definitely have the right to judge who you're attracted to based solely on looks. A lot of people do it without being judged for it, why should you?", "NTA.\n\nReal friends support you. I have spent many hours helping guy and girl friends spot crazy or bad matches on dating sites. It honestly can be more fun.\n\nHe's just upset because he might have feelings for you. Or might be insecure. \n\nDatings sites are 80% the pictures you use to express yourself. Not going to buy the product or look through the magazine if its not catchy.", "NTA for using an app that is designed precisely as you are using it. If they are acceptable guys to him, he is welcome to date them himself. \n\nThis sounds like a case of being nosey and then not liking the consequences of what being nosey produces: sometimes you find out things that you have a problem with but could've avoided it by minding your own business.", "NTA swipe on whoever you want, your standards for dating are your business. Depending on what you mean by crisis, he might have his own personal pain and resentment towards online dating. It's wrong of him to take that out on you. If a friend of mine was having an intense reaction to something seemingly benign that I did, I may compassionately listen to their feelings in order to understand their pain better and see if there's anything I can do to help them. But that depends on how comfortable and close I am with them. We live in a messy world that leaves many of us feeling insecure and invalidated, and I'm sure dating apps have worsened the issue. But his personal hangups should not have any bearing on who you date.", "NTA, seems like he has been hiding more than his snooping habits.", "NTA. \nHonestly, it sounds like he may have a crush on you but is insecure about it/himself and took that out on you.

He should also have been more diplomatic in calling you out on judging men on their looks.\n\nBut you are guilty of judging these guys on their looks and even gloating about by saying \"hell yeah\".  As someone who struggles to get dates primarily due to my looks, this really hit home.  Do you really want to be that type of woman?  Sure, if the men are downright ugly, dismiss them based on a picture alone.  But otherwise, it's about more than how they look.  Plenty of great looking people have no substance whatsoever.  If you gave more people a chance, you could stumble across someone you really end up liking.
