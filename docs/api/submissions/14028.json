Just trying to come up with something fun to say based on something I notice in a picture or the bio. but what the fuck do I know, I'm an idiot)\n\n Meanwhile, every woman I know who is actively using those apps has to sift through dozens of matches and hope one of them works out. \nI feel like a man dying of thirst watching a woman drown lol", "I can't imagine keeping that on my phone, queued-up like a Powerpoint presentation", "He does. A few minutes ago he texted me asking what features of his I don\u2019t like lol. I told him that he\u2019s a good looking guy but his desperate need for validation is just sad now. Like what does it matter what I think?!\n\nEdit: he sent me a graphic video of him with two girls, I guess to shock me (which is pretty hard to do). I just started giving unsolicited advice on the bedroom decor and he told me that I\u2019m in denial and in love with him (???). Totally rational. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t think our friendship will survive any longer.

One in particular needs to tell anyone and everyone, but in particularly female friends, all the girls he\u2019s hooked up with and basically demand they validate his desirability. It\u2019s so damn weird and it makes everyone uncomfortable. I don\u2019t actually think this one guy in particular is interested in his female friends, it\u2019s more that he wants them to want him because he \u201cobjectively\u201d thinks they should or something.\n\nSome men have this worldview that dating is quite literally a capitalist market where people should have objective universal desirability. So if your ex was 5\u20199 and a runner and had a job making 100k a year then you should absolutely like the guy who is 5\u201911, lift weights and makes 130k and then they flip their shit when you\u2019re like, yeah nice guy, good looking guy, but not for me. It somehow upends their world view and they get so mad. I don\u2019t entirely understand it, but I think it must come from the fact that they have built their life around achieving what they think women should want and then they lose it when they find out that women are people with their own unique preferences and desires.", "Because he is a creep and not your friend", "You are now a game to him it sounds like.

When I was younger there was a really nice attractive guy I met through work who was obviously into me.

I do genuinely hope he found the right person though, he was a really good guy.", "Emphasis on the harassment part! The amount of men I\u2019ve had match with me for the sole purpose of insulting my looks or intelligence is absolutely crazy.

Not like us women are winning the lotto here lmao", "NTA. Either he has feeling for you OP or he's projecting his feelings of rejection from other women. He's feeling like you're doing to him what other women have done to him. You didn't have to call him a creep though I think if he was slut shaming you for swiping right too much it would have been different for me. But this seems like this guy is genuinely feeling rejected and got a glimpse of how women can behave like men and reject based on looks alone.", "NTA but I think your friend is insecure that either you or other women aren't noticing him that way so he's taking it out on you. Maybe he doesn't actually value you for your friendship. Maybe get rid of him if he doesn't value it.", "Everyone is saying he's into her.. but I think there's also the possibility that he's freaked out internally because he's insecure and seeing her swipe on so many guys has him worried about his own chances with girls.", "NTA. The guy's creepy indeed.  \nI would not tolerate any involvement in my private business.", "NTA I don't think it was appropriate of him to be looking over your shoulder while you were swiping, and how and who you date is none of his business.", "NTA. They might be perfectly great dudes. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to be interested in them or give them a chance even if you\u2019re not into them. THAT would be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d People shouldn\u2019t use swipes on dating apps as a metric for their self worth. It\u2019s not what they\u2019re for.

His behavior is literally creeping.  Looking over your shoulder, judging you, berating you.", "Dude sounds insecure at best.\n\n I mean, the \"hell yeah!\" Response probably came off pretty shallow, but also like... I only ever used one dating app, and it showed more than just a picture (also a brief description of what the person was looking for and stuff) so me swiping left was based off more than just that. But also... I don't *want* to match with a lot of people? I want to match with maybe a few at a time and go from there. Too many people is exhausting. Also, it's okay to be picky. They're complete strangers, and you can't really expect to find THE one on your first go around. It's okay to just poke around on the app a bit too. You're fine.\n\nDude looking over your shoulder and projecting his feelings is creepy behavior and needs to dial it back.\n\nNTA", "Discussions like this make me feel old and out of touch.  Why you ask? They make me feel this way because I had to google what swiping left and swiping right meant.\n\nOh, before I forget.... NTA OP.  Your friend overreacted.", "This is the \"straw that breaks the camel's back\" for me. Every AITA post on my reddit feed is a sob story where OP clearly is not the asshole. I'm out.", "NTA. It seems your actions and response hit a sore spot of his, but you didn't do anything wrong. \n\nPeople look for different things in a relationship and they're specially picky when looking for a serious relationship, as you were. Plus, every so often, in a dating app, you get a long streak of people you're not interested in, so you just swipe left a lot.\n\nAnd creepy isn't a slur. He was creeping the moment he started peeking through what you were doing on your phone, so it was deserved.", "NTA. Truly, none of his business. I think most people are picky on dating apps. I think that's normal. And I'm pretty sure every single person judges the photos. That's the point. It's not morally wrong to want to be attracted to who you date. But also, let's say you wanted to be extremely picky and shallow about who you're dating, that's still completely your choice and none of his business. He's the asshole for invading your privacy and thinking he has any say in who you date.

NTA", "congrats OP you found the closeted incel!", "NTA I can get where his frustration comes from, but he doesn\u2019t get to take it out on you. Some guys swipe right on every profile they see and hardly ever get matches, especially guys who are not what most people find attractive. It\u2019s hard to not get frustrated and bitter from that amount of rejection and seeing how picky the opposite side can be could definitely flare those feelings. But that isn\u2019t your fault and he has no right to yell at you about it.", "ESH your friend for watching what you were doing on the app and voicing his opinion about it without consent. OP for calling friend creepy for voicing and opinion she didn't like. BTW  creepy used now to insinuate a sexual assault perpetrators even when you have no proof and used as a justification of saying your afraid the person will suddenly attack you.

Happy for you girl! I hope you find someone who is on par with your standards and is attractive too.

And apparently that wasn\u2019t his experience at all. He was mad jealous.", "NTA\nHe is definitely being creepy and shouldn't be in your business.

He just seems like one of those who projects and is critical.", "NTA. \n\nI'm currently working on editing the 'creepy' description out of my vocabulary. Often it's brushed off as a woman being 'dramatic' when she says a man is being creepy, it makes your observations of his behavior too easy to dismiss. Be specific. His opinions of your dating criteria showed he is far more invested in your dating than is warranted by your relationship, and his continued insistence that his opinion matters in this situation is possessive and condescending. Then he tries to DARVO this into being about how YOU were insulting to HIM? \n\nYour friendship MIGHT survive his initial reaction if he were able to talk about it like an adult. But no, when called out on his behavior he shifts blame so that he doesn't have to face any consequences or explain himself.", "NTA\n\nAnd you need to be careful around this so called \"friend\".

I made an account just to be able to reply to this.  I'm a sex educator and dating coach, and my main demographic for dating coaching is for straight men in their late 20s/early 30s who want to do better on the apps.  20% of my teaching is on how to take great photos for your dating app profile, because so many straight men just don't know how to present themselves properly online. \n\nHe's upset because he sees you swiping on every guy \"based on appearance\" and realizes that EVERY woman is swiping no to him because of HIS appearance.

By the way, Men swipe \"yes\" 46% of the time, women swipe \"yes\" 14% of the time. \n\nWe are told this narrative that \"men are visual creatures and women like personality\".  Sure, personality will be a factor when we meet someone in real life, but when most men don't really fill out the bio (and what they write isn't even that interesting), the only thing you have to make a decision is based on the photo.  Attraction, and specifically physical attraction, matters. A lot of straight dudes (not all, but a lot) want to be attracted to the woman they meet, but don't think about presenting **themselves** as attractive.
