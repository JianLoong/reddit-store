Ignorant and sexist go hand-in-hand quite often it seems.\n\nDude over here thinks that men don't swipe based on someone's pictures lol", "\u201cI\u2019m not an incel\u201d *says more incel stuff*", "Naw, just creepy incel vibes bro.", "Everyone except you apparently lmao", "It is nice when the creepy ones self identify at least.", "This is even creepier. Holy crap. I am so disgusted just from hearing that.", "yeah I feel like he wants me to want him but he doesn\u2019t even want me?? What.", "If you think a commonly-used, universally-understood idiom makes zero sense then the idiocy may be closer to home than you realise ...", "A lot of incels hold a belief that they are OWED sex and that people (usually women) need to lower their standards so incels can have a shot. You don't need to be an incel to have this mentality.", ">even more so than for women.\n\n.", "Alright fair enough, point taken. I sometimes get a little tired of offhand comments like this about men, effectively comparing negatively to women - but you\u2019re right that it was a bit of a thread hijack. And I\u2019m not meaning to suggest that women are shallow liars", "I assume some sort of ego thing where he wants to be wanted by everyone even if he doesn't want them. Dude's nuts.", "This is the guy you never leave your drink or friends alone with. I'm serious. Bad vibes", "Women are already less likely to use dating apps than men. I can speak from experience that its because its not really a good time for us either. And you want to make it worse? lol You already have to option to use Bumble where women have to message first, what more are you looking for?\n\n\n\nI just don't think you understand how supply and demand works. If you want more women on dating apps, you don't make dating apps less appealing than they already are for women. \n\n\n\nAnd I don't think you understand how bad actually going on dates with men from apps can be. It can literally be dangerous and thats a big reason why a lot of women just don't do it. There isn't equality in the level of risk involved for men and women.\n\n\nIf you want men to have an easier time finding matches on dating sites, make dating men safer for women.", ">a 70-30 gender split in population in dating app doesn't explain a 1000-1 by gender difference in messages sent and replied to on same apps\n\nIt's a natural, indirect consequence of the disparity.\n\nA 70:30  split means that even if women and men both swipe equal amounts and randomly, women's swipes are going to be twice as succesfull.\n\nNow, since any given person only has time for a given amount of online dating that means that women are going to start sending less messages, and men more.\n\nBut this adaption to the difference in success rate makes the problem worse. Repeat for a few cycles, and you end up in a system where men swipe on everything with a pulse and women can only touch the app for 5 seconds before they are buried in men.\n\n>its not true, imho, to say that this can not be solved: I believe that it can. But a solution requires making the women experience in the apps worse in a manner that is, quite frankly, a social taboo to discuss\n\nI don't see how any fix can overcome the disparity in useage rates. You can not materialize dates out of nowhere.", "Not getting matches > getting harassed, insulted, possibly SAed, murdered, or an unwanted pregnancy/STD from a dude who removed the condom\n\n\nI actually have an idea on how to improve things. Let women leave reviews for men that show up when women see a man on a dating site: \"insulted me when I didn't respond for a few hours\", \"tried to talk me into not using a condom\", \"sent unsolicited dick pics\", etc."]}
