He can work out his own shit and apologize.", "Staring over a friend\u2019s shoulder and starting a fight about how she\u2019s using a dating app is creepy behavior. If the shoe fits\u2026", "if he doesn't want to be called creepy he can stop being creepy! staring at her using a dating app is creepy!!", "If you don't want to be called creepy then don't be creepy.", "Don't be creepy if you don't want to be called a creep. Looking over a woman's shoulder to check who she's matching with on an app is creepy.", "Okay incel.", "I'm assuming it's an app like tinder... How ARE you supposed to judge someone there, tell me?\n\nI'm not gorgeous by any standard, but I never got mad I didn't get as many matches as my friend who is. They ARE judging you on your looks*, so if that doesn't work for you, don't use them.\nBesides, if you want someone that will not judge by looks you should be grateful that those that do ignore you.\n\n*Mostly at least. I swiped on my now husband because of a picture with stormtroopers and another in a museum I like. I did think he was objectively nice to look at though, just not my usual type.", ">But you are guilty of judging these guys on their looks\n\nThat's what dating apps are for though. You're not going to figure out if there's chemistry just from a few lines of a tinder bio.", "The guu he's acting I'd say he's realizing how difficult it'd be for him to find another gf or he's the one that was dumped.", "There you go, he dumped his gf thinking it will be easy for him to fuck around on tinder. Now he knows it's not easy, especially for a guy", "Lol. She definitely dumped him.", "NTA \n\nI just assume he has a crush on you. He was interested in your style of dating and you discarding so many(it's your right to play that way) he may feel he would be in the same bucket. \n\nHeck, if you were flipping through so fast, he may have even been one of the ones you threw out without recognizing him from the pics. I've seen people flip through 2-3 people per second barely getting a glance in. \n\nTbh apps like Tinder are +90% based on looks, few stop to read profiles of people they are swiping on..fewer of those have actually written anything and fewer still have anything good to say..to me it inevitably falls to looks, which you can then just flip with a quick glance.", "Sounds like he thinks women owe men their time and attention. That could be why he\u2019s now single", "Please give us an update when he inevitably confesses his feelings for you. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, and honestly, you should not keep this person in your life. \u201cCreepy\u201d was actually an understatement. I\u2019m getting incel-adjacent vibes.", "One thing about some men, a girlfriend isn\u2019t going to stop them.", "Is he interested in you? It seems strange he would breakup with his gf at the same time he\u2019s upset at you\u2019re choosing potential dates.", "Because it became clear to him that he does not have a chance", "On behalf of other brits, don't try to make us look stupid. Creepy is not a slur", "Creepy is an insult, not a slur.", "Hahahahaha it is definitely not a slur over here. I have never heard anyone ever call it a slur", "I'm fairly confident you're the only person in the British isles who thinks this.", "\u2026Well, congrats on being the only brit to believe so mate", "Mate, if \u201ccreepy\u201d was a slur over here we wouldn\u2019t have an episode of Peppa Pig called \u201cCreepy Crawly Safari\u201d.", "Did you honestly think you were the only Brit on Reddit, so nobody else would be around to say \"haha, wow, that's really incorrect and nobody actually thinks that\"? Because haha, wow, that's really incorrect. Nobody actually thinks that.", "It's not a slur because it isn't being employed to describe an immutable characteristic of a person but is instead describing their behavior.\n\nAlso you're creepy.", "Bro where's your proof it's a slur? Linking dictionary definitions isn't proof of shit. You can't make a claim with no proof then ask others to prove the counter claim that's not how it works.", "Word. The acquaintance I mentioned is even good-looking, but his terrible personality is so off-putting that I'm not surprised that no one wanted him before he found his wife.", "Found the incel", "If you don't want get robbed, don't leave the house \ud83d\ude44", "Lmao this is exactly what happened.", "Uhh well sort of an update?\n\nHe told me that girls always find him attractive and asked why I don\u2019t find him physically attractive. I explained that I recognize that he\u2019s an attractive dude, I\u2019m just not physically attracted to him. He said that it doesn\u2019t make sense lol. \n\nThen he started showing me pics of all the pretty girls he recently hooked up with lol", "\"Oh shit. She has standards?\"", "I forgot, it's such a compliment!", "Maybe a generational thing then?", "Give me an award you creep.", "Duh, that's \"creepy-crawly\". A totally different phrase.", "FAKE NEWS! You are probably from the Isle of Man or worse - the Isle of Wight. I claim myself as the only Brit here obviously.", "i think we are minimizing the degree by which men experience dating apps as a difficult and frustrating activity. the concept of swiping and messaging into the void and into catfish is commonplace for men to an astounding degree.\n\nwe are also minimizing the degree by which the men you are attracted to is influenced by the number of yes swipes available to you.  \n\ntaking action to improve how it is for men is almost taboo. that's a shame because honestly men exist too.", "Feel free to downvote and throw around buzzwords. But I\u2019d love to see someone actually provide a substantive response / counter argument. Expect I may be waiting a while", "If you behave in a creepy way then it is completely fair for someone to accurately describe your behavior.", "Insulting and a slur have different meanings.", "No it's a whiny, creepy guy thing", "not sure what generation classes creepy as a slur lmao", "No, it\u2019s describing the crawly as creepy. It\u2019s in the name. What if that crawly were offended at such a baseless allegation becoming it\u2019s common name? Why does no one use their Latin names? Won\u2019t someone think of these c-slur crawlies??\ud83d\ude2b\n\n/s", "It's not a problem that can be solved though, because at it's core tge problem originates from the wide disparity between male and female useage if dating apps.\n\nBasically every app is 70-90% men, which makes having equal match rates mathematically impossible.", "I agree that online dating seems utterly miserable for men, even more so than for women. However, idk how to improve that much without dramatically changing the mating habits of the human species. Female mating choices, and the related dynamic where men are significantly less choosy, are thought by many scientists to be the single most dominant force in evolutionary change. Hardee to tweak than an algorithm.", "No one is having a debate with you lol. You're a creep. No woman wants you and it has nothing to do with your looks.", "a 70-30 gender split in population in dating app doesn't explain a 1000-1 by gender difference in messages sent and replied to on same apps. the nature of use is radically different. \n\nbut: that is influenced by how the app is built, and what it offers to the genders, and how this plays out in the long run when it interacts with the baseline usage pattern of the app. \n\nits not true, imho, to say that this can not be solved: I believe that it can. But a solution requires making the women experience in the apps worse in a manner that is, quite frankly, a social taboo to discuss. \n\nmen a women behave on these apps in a certain way, and they do this due to a set of conditions that exist on the apps. change the conditions and the behavior will change.", "And you conclude this based on what? Because I suggested that perhaps women do care somewhat about looks? I\u2019m not even mad about that, it would be a double standard to care. Call me names based on nothing in particular if you want, but given how you\u2019re acting I highly doubt you have a bunch of great guys queuing up for you", "Lol, I'm into girls. And I definitely get more than you do because I'm not a creepy incel trying to debate everyone or looking over girls' shoulders to judge their dating app habits.", "You do realise I\u2019m not the OP right? When did I say I was looking over girls shoulders at their apps? You\u2019re needlessly bitter and hostile and getting riled up about a simple question. You don\u2019t know anything about me. Trying to debate on a discussion forum is creepy lol - whatever next", "Okay incel", "Lol just looked at your comment history and you're a creep who's into young girls too."]}
