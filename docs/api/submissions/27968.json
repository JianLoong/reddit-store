Her and her husband (who were married two years ago) bought a small condo and had a party in the condo complexes rec area-the invite said housewarming party but I never saw the actual condo.  The invite also had a link to a registry but I never clicked on that.\nAnyways I brought a nice candle to the party and a bottle of wine. But when I got there the gift table was filled with tons of gifts. I never have been to a housewarming party with so many gifts. It seemed odd. \nWell the next week I ran into Amanda at a coffee shop. She seemed cold and short with me but I was in a hurry and brushed it off. \nI mentioned the encounter to my sister and she said Amanda was upset by my gift as it wasn\u2019t something off the registry.  I was totally caught off guard. My sister said I should have just gotten something off the registry because Amanda and her husband never had a wedding or bridal shower and needed things for their place. But i never knew that and never thought of it since they\u2019ve been married over two years. Now I feel like the AH for giving her something she didn\u2019t need.

You had a reasonable assumption in thinking that they were set. I can understand frustration at giving a registry and it being ignored.

Your friend is rude.", "Mild YTA for bringing a dust-gatherer. It seems the registry had cheap options - a bath towel is less expensive than a good candle. Not everyone is into candles, not everyone likes open fire at home, and it's better to come without a gift (or just edibles, that bottle of wine would have been enough) than saddle people with something they have to throw out or re-gift, which can be considered asshole-y.\n\nAlso, as other people said, secondhand rumors don't have any weight. Are your sis and Amanda bff? Amanda didn't say anything to you, so unless she's really close with your sister, she probably wouldn't say anything to her either.", "NTA - There is nothing wrong with bringing a gift that was not on the registry.  You can decide that.  However if there was an invite and it specified to bring a gift from the registry, then YWBTA.

What if her condo has a 'no open flames' rule (some do)? She's allowed to not like your gift. She should have been a little more polite about it, though, and you could have just clicked the link for the registry to at least get an idea what the couple wanted.   \n\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
