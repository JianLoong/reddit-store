YTA. I get that not everyone can afford/have time for a fancy wedding, so they elope and don't have all their peeps there, but you FORGOT TO TELL HER?

I don\u2019t think YTA is the best judgment per se but I\u2019d probably have a strong reaction if I found out my friend had been married and just forgot to tell me, especially if y\u2019all see each other pretty regularly", ">So we got busy and forgot to tell anyone as we had to scramble.\n\nWhat? How could you \"forget\" that? Is it a secret? Did your family opposed to the marriage? You don't simply forget that kind of thing. YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS.: Look, I had a friend that after he got married, he started distancing himself from our group. For months we didn't hear from him, and then, one day, we find out from social media that he just had a child with his wife. We weren't angry about that, but from that moment on it was well understood by our group that the friendship was over - we stopped trying to talk to him, we stopped calling him to get togethers and all. We understood that we didn't mean anything to him anymore. So I understand very well why would anyone be pissed to learn that you got married only a year later.", "YTA I can't believe that you have been married for a year and have 'forgotten' to tell people you got married. Of course your BFF is mad. You just showed her how much you really think and care about her.\n\nYour families have to be upset about it, too.", "I dunno, but I do find the situation really weird. Even elopements are usually mentioned to best friends. If I were the best friend I would definitely be questioning my status in your life. I don\u2019t blame her for being upset.", "YTA for calling this person your bff, when you don't even talk about major events in your life.", "INFO: Did you even told anyone you were getting married", "YTA, is she really your BFF?? You didn't tell her you got married for a whole year?? I would feel like shit if the person I thought was my best friend never told me they eloped.", "YTA - not for inviting anyone to your wedding - that's the purpose of eloping.  did you not tell anyone?  did you tell your family?  if you told anyone you were married, but not your bff, that's a big AH move on your part.", "YTA: you were married for a year and didn\u2019t tell anybody. At least tell them after you got married", "info: where are you from and is there a different cultural significance to marriage in comparison to the celebratory most-important-day -of-your-life western model", "I literally tell my bff when I found a cool new game. I can't believe you don't think your marriage is important enough to be excited about to your bff. YTA", "Damn man YTA\nCongrats on getting married.but not telling anyone is super off and weird. Why would you hide something like that. If I was your family or friend and you had been married for years I would really question our relationship and it would definitely create an emotional rift. It would feel to me like you didn't care to include me in your life or wanted me in it at all. I completely get your BFF's side and you're and AH for not understanding why they would be upset", "YTA. I actually had a best friend do this to me, too! It was weird as hell. They're divorced now \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. You could have told people.

Of course they are hurt that you didn\u2019t share this major life event with them.", "YTA There\u2019s no way you don\u2019t even mention an elopement to your best friend.

No soap.", "YTA\u2026 not because of the situation with ur BFF because you got married over year ago and didn\u2019t tell your family about 2 weeks ago.\n\nIf you had say you wanted to keep it to yourself or whatever or only told close family might have understand but your excuse is you got busy and forgot to tell people you were married. I am surprised there aren\u2019t more people pissed at you .", "You forgot to tell everyone because you were too busy but also made sure to later but rings because you can now afford it? I think a lot of people would be hurt it someone close to them got married and never told them. I don't know if you're an asshole, but it seems really weird.", "YTA and also WTF.  You got busy and forgot.... to announce you'd eloped?  That is deeply weird.  Typically people announce their elopement after the fact but do indeed announce it.  It just doesn't take that long to make a post, send a group text, make a few phone calls.  You're likely to get a lot of people wondering what you were trying to hide by .... 'forgetting' to mention that you've been married for a year.", "YTA. Not telling your bff is like not sharing cake. But hey, congrats on the nuptials!", "YTA \n\nWho cares if you didn\u2019t invite someone. \n\nYou literally cannot call someone your BFF and not tell them you got married over a year ago.", "It's just a little weird how you can forget to say you got married... Even if you eloped, people would figure you two would be very happy to share you got married... At the same time it's not a obligation to say it to everyone, so I'll say NTA...but it's very weird to forget to mention that for a entire year", "NTA going against the grain. My uncle did the exact same thing and surprised us all at a family party that he and wife had been married for over a year. He didn't tell anyone and we're all happy for him", "ESH - If I was your best friend, I would want to know that you got married, even if the situation shook out in a way that you couldn't tell me until afterwards.  But, your friend should have responded better, too.  Tough situation.  As I've gotten older, I've come to realize that weddings are more important than I thought they were in my early 20s.  \n\n\nIn any case, it's a pretty low level of assholery.  Sit down and talk the friend through everything that happened, apologize, and if they can't get past it YNTA anymore.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to tell anyone about anything that you don\u2019t want to or haven\u2019t had time to. It\u2019s not like the friend is a bigger priority than your wife and getting your new life together. Give her time. If she\u2019s really your friend, she\u2019ll see what an AH she was in being angry with you and apologize. If not, was she really a good friend at all or did you just think she was. She sounds kinda jealous to me.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your life.\n\nYour bff is an immature, overly sensitive, AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How hard would it have been to either post or send out an email blast?", "NAH - while it's very unusual to keep such things quiet, I can understand low-key people for whom a simple piece of paper is no big deal or who don't wish to be the center of attention.  I can understand others who feel excluded and upset but at the end of the day, it's your business and not theirs until you choose to make it so.

Now you are in this weird place where you realize the marriage is real and other people weren't involved or told about it. \n\nNta if this is more or less what went down.
