I scoffed at her, went to bed.\n\nSerious, within the next half hour, there was a person trying to get in the back door.  Lucky the door was locked, right?\n\nI never lived that one down, and I did learn to always lock the doors.  Which of course led to yelling when I locked it and she had forgotten her keys.\n\nAnd, due to my forgetting to always turn off teh oven, and her repeated scolding, now every time I use my oven, I hear her voice in my head saying \"Corky!  Don't forget to turn the oven off!\"\n\nSo, yeah - you were justified.", "NTA.  I just keep thinking of those 4 Idaho students who were murdered.  They did not keep their doors locked.", "She has adhd for sure. They make spring\u2019s you can put on the door hinge so it shuts automatically. You can take the spring off before you move out so no permanent changes to apartment", "NTA. People who forget to lock their doors will always piss me off. I had housemates like that.", "NTA. I'm also 20 and I'm pretty good about remembering to lock the door when I'm home alone now, but when I was 18 and had just moved in with my roommate, who is 27 (she was my supervisor at work and when my parents were threatening to kick me out she offered me to stay with her... and now I can't live without her), I had left my keys in the door one day cause I was sleep deprived and just forgot them. If she had came and yelled at me about it I would've been completely understanding, but instead she hid my keys in the drawer my toothbrush was in and they got pushed to the back of the drawer, so instead of just trying to teach me a lesson she was woken up at 6am to me asking if she had seen my keys.", "Absolutely NTA here with the door open and unlocked anything could happen. Sorry not to scare you more but your roommate seriously needs to watch true crime tv shows about killers and rapists so she\u2019ll understand that forgetting is not an option. It\u2019s time for her to grow up. Did she not close and lock doors when living with her parents my goodness?", "NTA. Can you get an auto door closer?  It looks like there are some that you can use heavy duty double sided tape to attach to the wall and door.", "YTA", "I live in a relatively safe area and I would have responded the same way OP did. If RM was living by herself she can choose to live as dangerously as she wants, but when you live with other people there are basic considerations that are not negotiable. NTA.", "This. NTA. OP, I also just recently saw a Facebook ad for this thing that sticks to the top of the door and it has a metal... string that comes out of it. It basically forces the door closed and doesn't need to be screwed in. I would maybe look into that, because it looked simple and effective. So, it could at least slam the door every time after your roommate. Then, I'd hang a big sign on the door that says, \"LOCK THE DOOR!!!!!!\"\n\nAnd, I definitely think living with someone else is smart after this. My husband lived in a town where no one locked their doors. When he moved to college, one of his friends walked into his place and said, \"If I was a bad guy, you'd be dead right now.\" So, he started locking his door after that. You're really not asking for that much...", "LOL. Fortunately grew out of it. But it could be a serious risk if you have a child with a disability.", "I wonder how illegal it would be to hire a large male acquaintance to stage a fake break-in... probably very, but it's a thought.", "NTA, and talking to the landlord/management company is a good idea. They'll definitely be interested in such a blatant security issue, and you want to be sure you're not on the hook when something happens because of your roommate's gross negligence.", "If she has ADHD then she already gets the point and crime shows won't help, nor will any punishment.\nThe door alarm suggestion is a practical, helpful accommodation.", "Why would she call the police before alerting other residents, or checking that they were unharmed, or seeing if they knew anything about it? Police could be called 2 minutes later if required, not the instant as she saw light coming in.", "Was it she put op in danger with her incompetence.", "A friend used to have a small child that loved to roam.  Would run out the front door if you turned your back for a second. LOL. Fortunately grew out of it.  But it could be a serious risk if you have a child with a disability.", "My child was an elopement risk for a while and our front door opened right out onto the a busy street. Amazon sells door alarms for super cheap and they work very well.", "[removed]", "She obviously doesn't get the point. Situational awareness is necessary even for people with neurodivergence.", ">Why would she call the police before alerting other residents\n\nFair point, but screaming would have accomplished that.  Why would she just take her roommate's word that she was the one who \"might\" have left the door open, and not an intruder?", "She was understandably angry but...\n\n>Are you a child?\n\nI think this was pretty excessive. My ADHD was undiagnosed for decades so I admittedly have some bias here. My experiences of people infantilizing me for my forgetfulness are things I never forgot and I never saw those people the same way since despite any reconciliation.", "I did the microwave thing today. ADHD was my first thought about the roommate and an exciting delivery that made the \"shut and lock the door\" task dissipate from her working memory like glitter in sneeze.\n\nPre diagnosis and treatment, I have forgotten to lock my doors, even though I am in the habit of locking them behind me every time I go through them.", "That doesn't mean that the person in question shouldn't do everything they can to avoid the issue. Especially like in this case, that we're also talking about something very serious that puts their lives in danger.\n\nHaving mental issues doesn't mean we are excluded of taking responsibility of our actions (unless you're really completely unable to do so, in which case the person should have external help).", "She gets the point. The door needs to be locked for safety. I promise you, ADHD people understand that. Knowing the point does not help us when our working memory fails us in the moment. It is not related to not getting the point. It is a working memory issue that can't be controlled by the person. Medication and accommodations can help.\n\nShe still needs to take responsibility for the issue because it is not ok to leave the door open.", "I reckon she assessed the situation, realised there was a high probability that roommate had left the door open based on past behaviour and a foggy confession of sorts, checked nothing was missing, thanked her lucky stars, and determined police were not required.", "She could have been raped or murdered because of her roommates forgetful actions. I think it was warranted.", "Is she taking her meds? Cause she is being ridiculously unsafe. I have ADHD too so I get it but some things are non-negotiable. I forgot to lock my door one night and got raped. A guy followed me home and waited for me to fall asleep. I had been drinking (it was college) so I wasn't as aware as I should have been but if I had locked my door it would have been fine. \n\nShe is putting you both at risk and needs to find a way to remember. Try signs but if that doesn't work you'll have to get creative with other solutions like alarms. I saw someone recommended command strips to hold the alarm thing since you can modify your apartment. I'd definitely invest in something like that.", "Being your friend will be of no comfort to her if something horrific happens in a home invasion, SA, or worse. \n\nThis is a SAFETY issue. If you were my daughter I'd be worried sick about you. I'm still worried sick about you, and I don't even know you. \n\nSomething has to change, sweetheart. This can be a very bad world.\n\nNTA.", "Hopefully.", "It wasn't done out of malice. There are ways to express anger without demeaning people. What even is the point of something like this? What benefit could anyone possibly gain?", ">Elopement as I heard of it just means getting married\n\nI mean, if your toddler ran away and got married, wouldn\u00b4t you call that risky?", "Yeah, the use of \"elopement\" confused me as well.", "OMG I am so sorry this happened to you, Talvana.\n\nOP, THIS is why it is so CRUCIAL that she not be excused from this even though she's your friend!!!!", "I have ADHD and do a nightly walk-through ritual to check that the stove is off, cabinets are closed, doors are locked _and_ deadbolted, candles are blown out, etc. It sounds ridiculous, but I'd rather waste five minutes than risk my safety.", "It\u2019s a commonly used term in elementary schools as well.", "I do something like this too. I don\u2019t have adhd (I don\u2019t think) but for years ive just done the loop at the end of the night to make sure everything is set.", "I was the roommate who never remembered to lock the door, and literally got called out for it by my roommate minutes before an elderly woman, with some sort of cognitive issues, tried to force her way in.\n\nShe was pretty hostile, had to call the police.  I felt pretty bad about, considering the cops showed 15 minutes later, and the poor woman had barely hobbled to teh end of the driveway.\n\nCaps asked if I wanted her charged or anything, and I told them all I wanted was her not at my door, and taken someplace safe, like a shelter or her home.\n\nI mean, yeah, she was pretty shouty and stuff and I wanted her gone, bu I didn't want her wandering around the city late at night in winter, either.", "NTA\n\nAn unlocked door is a huge safety issue. I'd yell at her ass too. Then, throw her out.\n\nThankfully, you're moving in with someone else - let's hope they have common sense.", "NTA. Your friend, however, is totally the asshole. How often is she leaving the door unlocked/open when she leaves home? That\u2019s a recipe for disaster.", "NTA but as an adult you should just know the door means absolutely nothing if someone wants in.", "NTA\n\nWho the hell doesn't close and lock the door in an apartment building? That's just negligent.", "NTA. Outside of having some sort of ADHD type of disorder, how does one forget to close the door? I can see forgetting to lock it, I guess, but forgetting to close it? Definitely move out when you can. She's putting both of your lives in danger.", "NTA.  She needed that lashing and probably a couple more before your lease is up.", "NTA. I get mad at myself if I wake up in the morning and realize I forgot to lock/put the chain on the front door (even though the outside handle is still locked/can't be opened)", "NTA, I would scream at her even at 3AM. This is insane, huge safety issue.", "Why? They were completely justified... some people need to be yelled at to get it. If she has ADHD then it might've been the only way it'll stick for her, I'm the same way. Once I make a habit, like not locking the door, it might take getting yelled at to make it stick for me.", "That\u2019s for an elopement risk. While the idea is great, I\u2019m not sure it is useful here. A grown ass adult is forgetting to close her own door. That\u2019s ridiculous and RM needs to learn her lesson. I don\u2019t blame the OP for going off on RM.", "Does your lock connect to wifi, or does it just lock automatically after a certain period of time and that's it? I'd love something like the latter for my partner who also has adhd and forgets to lock our door, but I'm not really open to a lock that can be accessed and hacked via wifi.", "[removed]", "Yeah, I felt like I went overboard, which is why I apologised. I didn\u2019t want to ruin a long term friendship over something I said in the heat of the moment", "It\u2019s not auto unfortunately, but I also have a sliding glass door so I figure that any lack of security introduced by a hackable lock is much more easily introduced by someone with a rock lol", "That's so cool. I've only looked at catalogs since I'm not traveling right now, but even the manual items kinda blew my mind. Guess I *do* need to get out more!", "Haha fair enough! XD", "I've heard flight risk used to describe elderly relatives who were likely to wander and I think it's pretty appropriate. My grandparents had to call the cops on one such relative because he just disappeared one day. He was found creeping on women in a grocery store.", "Good habit!  \n\nAnd that's the thing.   You have to be willing to make those kinds of changes - to instill habits in yourself - in order to function well in our society.   \n\nOne of my main issues used to be being late - for *everything*.    It finally dawned on me, so much later in life than I care to admit, that other people are seriously inconvenienced  by my tardiness and they were getting annoyed and sometimes angry with me.    Doctors started actually charging me for missed/late appointments.   \n\nSo I made it a habit of leaving a half an hour early for every place I had to be.   Often I arrived on time because of traffic or a missed bus or other life happenings.    Mostly I just arrive early to everything and read during my extra wait time.\n\nI've also tried to instill this in my children, too, because, as we know, ADHD can be passed on to our kiddos.  \n\nOPs friend needs to take her concerns very seriously and not just blame her ADHD on why she's that way, but to actually take steps to change her behavior.   It IS possible.", "YTA, but for apologizing.\n\n\nYour safety is at risk.", "NTA - better you then a creep walking in. Roommate needs to grow up and be way more responsible.", "NTA.

Closing the door is the absolute bare minimum for safety.", "NTA\n\nSomething is up with her if she can't remember to lock the front door. Do you live somewhere particularly safe...?\n\nMaybe take anything valuable you have in common areas to your room, and lock your room door.

You were justifiably angry, even more so with the extra edit. \n\nHow long until you move? Nothing short of doing a once over of the house every hour to make sure the damn door is locked is gonna stop this idiot it seems.", "NTA. You didn't wake her up just to yell at her.

Her ADD isn\u2019t an excuse to not close the door. She is putting herself and you in danger every time she does this. The fact that there was also has been shot recently so close is crazy. Absolutely put up a sign.

Can you talk to your landlord about getting off the lease early? This is a pretty serious concern. It\u2019s not just unlocked it\u2019s open!
