She seemed pretty receptive to it, but since then her habit of forgetting it hasn't changed.\n\nI have a lot of issues with sleep, and last night I wasn't able to get any, so I went downstairs to grab an energy drink at around 7. The first thing I noticed was that there was a light coming from our front door, and as I came closer I realised it was unlocked and partially open. The first thing that came to mind was that there was a break in, and I panicked and woke up RM because I thought we got robbed or something. I told her that our door wasn't closed all the way, and was freaking out pretty badly. Then she said \"oh, that's most likely my fault, I got delivery pretty late and probably forgot to close the door\". The way she was so nonchalant pissed me off, and I was already exhausted, so I rounded on her and yelled, \"what the fuck is wrong with you? I thought I asked you to be more careful about this, we've been living in this flat for 5 months now and now you can't even shut the door properly? Are you a child? Should I tape a goddamn sign to the door that reminds you to close it?\". I didn't let her say anything after my rant and just went to my bedroom, but I felt bad about it later.\n\nI did apologise to her already, and we went grocery shopping together, and everything seems ok between us, but I still feel like an AH. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: I can't change the title, sorry it's kinda misleading. I'd get a door alarm but I'm not even allowed to install my own curtains in this apartment so I'm a bit screwed in that regard. I grabbed an energy drink because I had a 9am class that I didn't end up going to because I was so pissed. And on top of the basic security concerns, someone got shot in the apartment complex like a block away from ours so I've been more paranoid than usual.\n\nEdit 2: When our lease ends I'm moving in with a different friend, so hopefully we don't have any major incidents until then.", "created_utc": 1674541088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jyz7z/aita_for_waking_up_my_roommate_at_7am_and_yelling/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You thought you had been robben, you do not wait to wake up everyone in the house if that happens. The robber might even still be there.\n\nYour words might have been harsh, but that is often what happens when you get scared, you end up angry.\nEven where I live, I tripple check that the front door is locked, and I live in a safe area. But still, I always check an extra time or two just to be sure the front door is locked.\n\nAnd if this happened once more, I would put up a big sign on the door, to remind people to close and lock the door.", "NTA.  She's endangering both your lives, health and safety by leaving the door open.  There is no excuse, she's an adult.   This is serious.  Not only could you be easily robbed, you could be raped or killed.  You've already talked to her about it, and she still kiwis doing it.  Tell her if it ever happens again, you are getting a new roommate.  And follow through.", "Title is a bit misleading OP.\n\nYou didn't wake her up at 7AM to yell at her. You woke her up at 7AM in your panic since you were thinking that your flat got broken into, and then when you found out that she was the one who left the door ajar, you yelled at her because the issue has already been discussed before.\n\nWith that, I'd go with NTA. The anger is warranted and I think she understood that it's her fault and the risk she's put you both into.", "NTA. I couldn't live with someone who was so nonchalant about leaving your door not just unlocked but *partially open.* \n\nIf it's just unlocked, anyone walking past would have to try the knob in order to realize it's not locked but any rando walking past could notice the door isn't even closed. \n\nShe's lucky all that happened is she got screamed at. You're both lucky.", "NTA but I think your title is wrong. You woke her up at 7am to tell her you thought you'd been burgled or there might be a burglary in progress. When she said it was probably just her leaving the door open again, then you yelled at her. If you'd woken her up just to yell at her then Y-T-A, but you didn't. You were genuinely concerned and scared. \n\nHave you considered a weighted string set-up to at least pull the door closed once it's opened? It's a pretty old school way of doing it but it's less damaging to the property (can be rigged up with a weight, string and a couple of thumb tacks). It's also a permanent and obvious reminder about the door as it's on the door!", "NTA\n\nHer negligence is making an unsafe living situation for both of you.\n\nThere are some cheap door alarm options that will link up to your phone. Maybe worth getting one for some peace of mind.", "NTA. Talking to her nicely didn't work. Yelling seems like a logical next thing to try.", "NTA - This is a huge safety issue and I worry for you that she won\u2019t get the message and change her habits until someone actually breaks in (if you can really call it that since they\u2019d just be walking in the open door). I hope if something does happen it\u2019s small and harmless but enough of a scare to knock some sense into her, like a stranger falling asleep on the couch. But with a full open door and a world full of not so trust worthy people it\u2019s likely to be worse. For you, you\u2019ll need to find a safer roommate who cares about their own well-being and yours by shutting and locking doors at night. Let this girl continue her hazardous ways by herself.", "Her reaction is what I would give you if I was trying to be the pettiest asshole making a point possible because I felt like you were being a jerk.\n\nLeaving a door open is bad enough that you're NTA here in basically any situation.", "NTA. She may not see it as a big deal but that\u2019s extremely dangerous and I don\u2019t think you went too far when calling her out.", "NTA this is super not cool.", "Nah I would\u2019ve gone off as well.", "NTA, this is a safety issue.\n\nHonestly at this point I would look into your lease and figure out a way to get out of it/talk to your management company.\n\nThat door needs to be locked, you\u2019re in the right about that.", "NTA\n\nShe deserved a good scolding. You should move out of there / replace the roommate if possible.

But i guess even this wouldn't help. \n\nWe have a door that automatic falls back after opened, i wonder if you can install something to reach the same effect?", "NTA. Your roommate is incredibly inconsiderate and daft. I would not have apologized. There are door alarms that attach with removable strips. Called command strips. They can things firmly in place but remove without damaging the surface. Also the type of door alarm you want it the type that goes off when the sensors on either end go off when they are no longer in contact. Once you close the door they are in contact and stop alarming. I really hope you reconsider getting the sensor alarm for your doors. Your roommate is putting you both in danger.", "YTA - for *this* - \u201cAITA for waking up my roommate at 7am and yelling at her?\u201d\n\nYes. You don\u2019t wake someone up and then on top of that yell.

But if she has a mental issue (ADHD possibly) it would at least explain her behavior.  \n\nPeople like that need to understand that they are still responsible for closing doors, cupboards, and water faucets.    Doors obviously being the most important of those.   \n\nI guess you are going to have to put up signs in your home as reminders of how to behave like an adult living with other adults.", "She has been diagnosed with ADD, but I don\u2019t wanna treat her like a child, she\u2019s still my friend", "I apologize for being rude towards your friend.   I didn't mean to be unkind.     \n\nThere are strategies  that can help her develop habits; like closing the door and turning off lights.   \n\nPutting up notes as reminders isn't so bad.     \n\n\n\nI know what it's like to have ADHD.   I forget things all the time.  But I've gotten to the point where I'm slightly obsessed with things like doors and cupboards.   Doors because of our dogs that I don't want running outside, and cupboards because I've whacked my head on ones that were left open numerous times and I'm not up for doing it again.  \n\nBut you don't want an object lesson by leaving the front door open.  It could be disastrous."]}
