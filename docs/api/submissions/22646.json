Basically a \"Debby Downer.\"\n\nAfter months of her going on and on about how awful her coworkers are, I decided to take a look for myself.

She would roll her eyes and obnoxiously sigh when customers left her registry. It wasn't comfortable to watch.\n\nI was there for about 2 hrs when I decided to leave and go back home.

You will find such people all around you.\n\nThere are also people who are karma farming, practising for their creative writing competition on reddit and then comes some people who post rage-bait stories to see how commenters are going to react in their replies.", "I refuse to believe humanity would sink that low.", "I\u2019ve been here long enough to realise people make any old shit up", "Eh I can believe it. I mean, this exact situation is still incredibly weird, but when I worked at Whole Foods back in the day we had regulars who would literally hang out in the store *all day*, on a regular basis. They would get pre-made food and sit in the cafe, buy a drink every few hours, etc. Management had no problem as long as they weren't disruptive.", "I can\u2019t imagine anyone working at a grocery store would do that. They don\u2019t care. People are in and out all day. Lots of people just sit and watch people while drinking a coffee.", "And if the person answered \"I'm just waiting for my girlfriend, so I can drive her home after work\", what would you do?  \n(OP was there 2 hours, not the whole day).", "Yeah if someone was loitering within hearing distance of the registers at the grocery store I work I'm pretty sure security would get involved in a concern that the guy was trying to steal people's credit card info or something? And going \"no I'm so and sos spouse\" wouldn't be able to stop that??", "Why would her co-workers need to agree?\n\nThis is a public place.", "Yes, it is weird.", "Oh for sure. I feel like he had enough information to go off of to begin with \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", "Not who you\u2019re asking but I kept tallies in a notebook under columns - work, husband, daughter, car, grocery store (yes that was a category in itself), medical problems", "Some supermarkets have a cafe inside", "There's no reason her coworkers have to know anything. If she works the register at a grocery store he may just have bought something to eat and drunk at the deli and sat down in the little Cafe seating a lot of them have.", "\u201cLexi don\u2019t look now but I think that guy has been following and watching us for over an hour. Should we talk to security?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s my husband. I invited him to watch me.\u201d\n\n\u201c????\u201d", "Not if you're a person trying to prove how awful other people are.  My mother did that sort of thing when  she was still alive, shit talk about the neighbors and tell me how awful they were, blah blah blah. I'd walk to the mailboxes to get the mail and people would ask me how she was doing, hadn't seen her much,  and actually be friendly and sweet. It can definitely be bizarre at times dealing with someone that negative that refuses to see that they are the problem.", "I was joking. Forgot my /s", "Lol. I love Whole Foods. If I wanna get out of my house with my laptop for a few hours,  I go to my local coffee shop, but if the Whole Foods were closer I'd definitely go there instead!", "Unless the Cafe was in hearing distance of the register, I'd tell him he needs to stop crowding his girlfriend and making customers uncomfortable and go text on his phone on a bench somewhere? Loitering by the registers for hours would not be tolerated.", "Ethically, it's wrong to listen in on other people's conversations.", "I had a cube mate who was so negative and so toxic the air was literally lighter when she wasn't around. Like you literally felt like you needed to take a shower after 8 hours of non-stop gossip and complaints. Noise cancelling headphones were a life saver until I was able to get out of there.", "People with persistent depressive disorders still deserve love! But it would be difficult to prescribe anything to a stuffed animal, so unfortunately there's not much to do other than give him love and support.", "To me, the point of Eeyore is that he\u2019s a depressed bastard but his friends still love and include him and he tries not to bring them down, and nobody judges him if he just wants to sit and be sad. Anyway, that helped me.", "I\u2019ve always heard it as \u201cif you smell shit everywhere you go, check the bottom of your own shoe\u201d", "I like that!  :)", "I don't think anyone ever has heard that saying", "He was there for 2 hours and could hear their conversations, he almost certainly can\u2019t do that from a cafe area. The wife is mainly the issue here but that is weird as hell lol and her coworkers surely thought so too", "My MIL \ud83d\udcaf", "When my grandma\u2019s dementia started kicking in she was obsessed with watching everything. But she was also convinced I was having sex with my gay best friend and all the neighbors knew because the \u2018saw\u2019.", "snooping by doing a normal daily activity like checking the mail for a few minutes and talking to people is not like staying for two hours to watch your spouse at their workplace, even if she told him to. like, did he really need to see it to believe it? he already believes his wife is a pessimist and can be negative, at that point i don't really understand why they're together if he doesn't like her attitude.", "Thank god. I was scared for a minute wondering how someone could ask this on reddit.", "There is one couple I see at my grocery  who are so sweet. The husband and wife come to store, but he doesn't walk as well as she does. So she goes and gets the groceries while he gets a paper and a drink. He sits at the bench and waits for her to be done while he reads the paper. They give each other kisses whenever they part and again whenever she picks him up at the benches. \"Husband benches\" is exactly what I think when I see them as well, because of that couple!", "I have", "There's aWhole Foods in my town that is set up like this. Seating is pretty close to the registers.", "place i work at has the seating area right next to the registers, totally possible & i probably wouldn\u2019t even notice someone sat there for 2 hours - i got stuff to do", "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible but every grocery store I\u2019ve seen the cafe is at least far enough they wouldn\u2019t hear conversations at the registers. Either way I just think they\u2019re both weirdos lol the wife more so", "Oh you must not work in customer service then, cause they absolutely do.\n\nHell, a lot of them do that exact thing in hopes they get approached so they can have a ***45 minute conversation with you about something completely unrelated to purchases made in this store***.\n\nPlease just write fanfic instead of demonizing human interactions or just existing around people. Again, we don\u2019t even know if he engaged in discussion with his gf which would just make him _____\u2019s friend and not some rando.\n\nSo many reasonable explanations for people to go with the TV drama one lmao"]}
