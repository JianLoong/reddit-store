She would roll her eyes and obnoxiously sigh when customers left her registry. It wasn't comfortable to watch.\n\nI was there for about 2 hrs when I decided to leave and go back home.

But at this point, it's starting to damage her work life and marriage.  OP is NTA and Lexi needs antidepressants, CBT, something. Her constant misery is wearing away at the foundations of the life she's built.", "Some supermarkets do have little food areas or cafes, but not normally so close to the cash you'd be able to overhear conversations.", "All of the grocery stores near me have benches behind the tellers, against the wall. A lot of older gentlemen sit there and wait while their wives shop.", "Yeah i just read it. Its super weird. And so petty. Would never ask my bf to come and check how mean my coworkers are! If my coworkers are actually mean to me ill have a convo w them ot report them if its out of hand.", "Depends on the size of the supermarket. A lot of smaller or independent stores near me will have a cafe/seating area.", "Were you able to get through to them?\n\nI have a Donnie Downer coworker, and I'm afraid this would never work on him. And I once said to him, \"Dude! We were talking about happy stuff over here. Where did that (he brought up a horrible car accident into the discussion) come from?\" I now do my best not to make conversation with him, but he'll still complain to me about life when all I want is help on a case.", "Anyone who doesn't like eeyore is a real Winnie the pooface", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC80580/\n\nEeyore was \"diagnosed\" in this article, with having a form of persistent depressive disorder!\n\nEdit: still love him though", "OP's wife has obviously never heard the saying:\n\n**\"If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.\"**", "Supermarket workers don\u2019t only work at registers, some stock and work on the aisles.\n\nHe could just as easily stood around while she stocked an aisle, either with a coworker or adjacent from another coworkers aisle. \n\nClear opportunity to overhear conversation. You\u2019d be surprised at how much, essentially, background noise you tune out in public. Unless he actively was eyeing her coworkers with his finger in his belly button, nobody cared about his presence I bet.", "In the supermarkets I go too there are seats and benches at the end near the tills - so people wait for their family to pay and bag up. Also quite a few have a cafe on the other side of the tills", "I've heard of these, and other such chairs in stores, jokingly referred to as \"husband chairs\" for exactly this reason.  It's kinda weird nobody is actually addressing OP's question because their minds are completely blown by the idea that somewhere in America there's one supermarket with a sitting area very near the checkout. It's seriously not that preposterous, people! \n\nAnyway, NTA, OP.", "My instinct says I've put off the chatter *for now.* The root of the problem is the job, sure...but if he gets complacent then he will stop whining and it will start again before Christmas because the holidays are a rollercoaster of emotions then too. But complacency will translate into stopping efforts looking for another job, so no concrete changes will be made and it will just repeat until the worst-case scenario ACTUALLY happens.\n\nI said to him once \"for someone who has a lot of misery, I'm surprised you don't drink more.\" And this is coming FROM me as an alcoholic. Like do you want to fix anything or are you actually ENJOYING bitching to people and you just don't know it?", "I imagine you could go into any supermarket in your area, find a bench, and sit down for two hours.  Who would even notice or care?  Unless they suspect you are casing the joint or something, the workers certainly aren't going to give a crap.  Many such benches are within earshot of registers, which seems to be a least part of OP's wife's job.", "This is just me, so idk if this is for all supermarket workers, but I NEVER notice if someone has been in the store for a long time, let alone 2 hours. I just notice that they\u2019re shopping", "I do that over instacart THEN go to the store and buy what I need in person (usually I'm pleasantly surprised at a cheaper grocery bill). But then again, American grocery stores make me anxious for some reason and I hate them.", "He said she is a cashier.", "You know what\u2019s even more understandable?\n\nShe has a section of a couple aisles she\u2019s responsible for stocking and *gasp*, he stood next to her while she stocked items.\n\nPeople coming up with \u201cweird strange man in the store\u201d as if they truly pay attention to half the shit around them. I bet not a single person other then her coworkers *possibly* even noticed his existence.", "Meh.  I'm not saying this post isn't super weird in all the other things but my local whole foods has full booth seating with tables and cutlery right behind the cashier and next to the glass facade.  I've seen the same in 3-4 other whole foods in other states.  Same with a starbucks at our Target and our Safeway.  They were open air and just behind the cashier (like 15 ft away) and you could chill all day with latte and wifi while the CVS (also in the Target) took their sweet time filling your prescription.  Sometimes I would overhear boyfriend drama from the college kids working part-time so much so I had to stop myself accidentally talking about it.", "Well my local H\u2011E\u2011B has benches right behind the registers so that\u2019s not out of the ordinary.", "But OP says she was working the register, not shelves. Also, the coworkers would definitely notice a guy standing around in the aisles for hours. That's strange as hell.", "It\u2019s not really, it\u2019s the implication of internet weirdos that project that onto it.\n\nIt\u2019s as if y\u2019all imagine he had a notepad and was taking notes, not walking around and presumably engaging in conversation with his gf.\n\nThis is so, \u201cI made up the most interesting theory\u201d vibes lmao", "I've literally worked at a grocery store. I didn't imagine him with a notepad, taking notes. I imagined him standing around within earshot of his wife for 2 hours, which would definitely be noticable. Heck, it would probably be noticable the first time you walked past him, as customers aren't just standing around like that."]}
