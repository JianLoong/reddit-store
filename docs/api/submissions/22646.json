Lexi and I have always had a pretty solid relationship. We do have our issues just like any other couple, but we always work through it in the end. One reoccurring issue that has been causing some drama lately is Lexi's coworkers.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, Lexi got a new job at a local supermarket. Roughly 3 months into it, she started complaining about how her coworkers don't like her and that she can't stand them. She kept going on and on about how annoying they are and that her coworkers claim the reason why they don't like her is because she's a \"constant downer.\"\n\nI wouldn't say anything during these discussions, but I would find myself secretly agreeing with Lexi's coworkers. I love Lexi, but one trait that has always been an issue, is her pessimism. Lexi has a bad habit of thinking negatively, assuming the worst in other people and generally has a defeated attitude. Basically a \"Debby Downer.\"\n\nAfter months of her going on and on about how awful her coworkers are, I decided to take a look for myself. A couple days ago, I had the day off, so I went to Lexi's place of work and observed her interacting with her coworkers. Lexi knew that I would be there and insisted that she would prove to me that she's being \"unfairly targeted.\"\n\nDuring several interactions, Lexi would endlessly complain about having to be at work, she would say nasty things about customers, etc. She also had very bad body language. She would roll her eyes and obnoxiously sigh when customers left her registry. It wasn't comfortable to watch.\n\nI was there for about 2 hrs when I decided to leave and go back home. After Lexi came home from work, she immediately started complaining about her coworkers and how \"cold they were towards her for no reason.\" \n\nShe felt vindicated and said: \"So, do you believe me now? Now do you understand why I have to bitch all the time? Maybe now you can understand how I feel.\" I explained to her that, based on what I observed, I actually agree with her coworkers.\n\nLexi exploded on me! She yelled that I'm just like everyone else and that I'm a \"slimey weasel\" for siding with her coworkers. She stormed out of the house and is currently staying with her Mom. I'm trying my best to understand where she's coming from, but I don't know what else I can do.

Why are you just watching her work for two hours? This all seems super immature and bizarre.\n\nEditing as you mentioned you had the day off. I still find it incredibly unusual.", "I'm afraid I do think YTA. The issue is stringing her along by letting her think for months you are going to give a favorable response or decision, and then suddenly confronting her with an unfavorable decision that is a shock to her. I see it happen at work as a supervisor when I have to reverse a line worker and give bad news to the client. It is an error of communication and building up false hopes.\n\nIt's mostly inevitable, but also preventable. In this case, you knew that you considered your wife someone who complains inappropriately, so you missed an opportunity to ask skeptical questions or give some other kind of forewarning.", "YTA but I understand where you're coming from. Most of the time when people complain about work they don't want advice, they just want to vent.

We will be homeless. We might as well break the lease with no B-plan. The list goes on and on...\n\nand for months, NOTHING happened. Finally I said \"if you are doing your job and can't be fired for cause, laying you off is rather expensive so I think your position is FINE.\" and I added: there's nothing wrong with a little imposter syndrome but stop worrying yourself into sickness because you're dragging my mood down with you with all this. \n\nAlthough I think all of this is because of social media and the idea that \"comparison is the thief of joy.\" Well yeah your fancy friends working finance living in big-city high rise towers looks fun, but that's them and you are you.\" And you only see the presentable portions, nothing that's ever disheartening.", "Adorable for the length of a movie perhaps, but to live with full time?
