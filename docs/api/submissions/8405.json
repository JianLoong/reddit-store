To increase his odds, he got a perfect 1600 on the SAT, was in the top 1% of our class, won a few national level writing competitions, and had worked with a professor to publish a research paper. He applied early to Yale late 2022, and he ended up getting rejected. \n\nThe same day he found out, a kid was throwing a huge party because he found out he had gotten into his top choice. I had gotten into mine too and wanted to celebrate, but Arjun asked I keep him company, and I decided I\u2019d rather spend time with him to cheer him up. \n\nHe had texted his girlfriend Sarah as well, asking her to come too. She said she wanted to go to the party since it was going to be a big one and she didn\u2019t want to miss it, and that she would be there for him the day after. \n\nPersonally, I found this kinda mean\u2014 sure, she can be there the day after but of course, but the first day right after you learned you didn\u2019t get into a school you\u2019ve been dreaming of going to for 10 years is going to hurt the most, and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll need somebody the most. So brushing that off and going to a party seems mean to me. \n\nAnyways, I stayed with Arjun, we ordered some pizzas, watched some of his favorite movies, you get the idea. The day after, I received texts from Sarah accusing me of making her \u2018feel like a bad girlfriend\u2019 by supporting him while she was going to a party. I pointed out I didn\u2019t even speak to her since the week before (she and I don\u2019t talk that much in general) so I couldn\u2019t have said anything to her to indicate I thought that. So, if she felt at way, it was her own guilty conscience. She asked if I did think she was being a bad girlfriend, and I responded that not supporting somebody you\u2019re supposed to care for when they need it most does make her a bad girlfriend. \n\nShe called TA.

You didn't say anything to her to the first place so why is she trying to say you made her feel like a bad girlfriend?", "NTA her poor choice does not reflect badly upon your good choice and she knows that.", "NTA would she have preferred that you weren't there to comfort him, so he was completely alone the day his dreams were crushed?", "NTA. She made herself feel like a bad girlfriend through her actions.  All you did was confirm that she was right.", "NTA. While it hurts Arjun now, if he has those high scores and is a high achieving student, he could likely get a full ride to many programs that are just as good as Yale. I know young people like to get caught up in the fancy school names, but trust me, as a working professional, I have encountered many highly successful business people who graduated from state schools. \n\nI'm glad you're there supporting your friend. It will get better!", "NTA-Truth hurts.", "NTA She asked for your opinion. Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to. She knows she was in the wrong and I'm sure a few people asked her where her bf was...", "Nta- now she feels bad for being an unsupportive gf when your friends was hurting. You\u2019re a good friend and her actions showed how much she really cares about your boy", ">So, if she felt at way, it was her own guilty conscience.\n\nNailed it.

I'm not in high school anymore (thank god) but if my SO was feeling down, I wouldn't even want to be anywhere else but with them. She just needs to grow up some more.", "NTA. She absolutely felt guilty and decided to blame you instead of accepting that she sucks", "lol NTA, like not even a little bit", "May be an unpopular opinion but I don't feel the gf did nothing wrong. They were both young and what could she have actually done to make him feel better. He was going to be sad for a long time if that was his dream since 7. Her being there would have been a bandaid for his feelings. Did the friend even congratulate any friends that got in college? Why he didn't tell her he wanted her there instead. I'm glad she decided to have fun for one night. Shit she probably was only a teenager and we all know teenagers.", "I understand your friend was hurt, but at the same time was his girlfriend supposed to mope around with him and not celebrate something she also worked hard for and earned?

Has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. You called her out for her bad behaviour and she didn't like it, so she is chucking a tantrum. End of story.", "NTA that is all her guilt coming out, and instead of admitting that she wasn't supportive, she's trying to blame you.  Ignore her, you were a good friend.", "NTA  \n\n\nshe went to a party and is now feeling guilty and trying to pass the blame to someone else", "NTA", "NTA\n\nGuilty conscience. You nailed it in one.", "NTA - Unfortunately for her she was asking you a question and hoping for reassurance that everything was fine. You gave her an honest answer and now she is upset about it. \n\nIt really isn't more simple than that. \n\nShe didn't want an honest assessment - she wanted to believe that her choices are absolutely cool. Well now that's a problem for her and her relationship going forward.", "NTA. Your friend shouldn't give up though. Reapply. Or if he can, appeal the rejection. His persistence may pay off.", "NTA you\u2019re a very good friend. I\u2019m sorry to hear about Arjun", "NTA. If she wasn't a bad girlfriend, she would be glad that you were with Arjun to support him. She doesn't care about his feelings.", "Her excuse was that it would be the biggest party of the year and she could be here for him the next day", "She would rather go to a party than support him, so at least she recognizes that bad and feels guilty", "She knows she was wrong and I'm sure some people asked her where her bf was...", "yeah, I think she was being very selfish", "Probably a guilty conscience", "I think she\u2019s angry with my choice because it does magnify that she was being selfish", "I think that would have made her feel less guilty because she could think she only did what anybody would, but that just shows her selfishness", "Yeah, it\u2019s evident that me being there and so highlighting the fact she wasn\u2019t there while others were there made her feel guilty, so she\u2019s lashing out", "exactly", "Yeah, not only going to a party while he\u2019s so upset but specifically going to a party where people are celebrating acceptances while he got rejected was cruel", "Yeah, it\u2019s unfortunate how much he likes her since she\u2019s not there for him when the chips are down", "Yeah, I think the fact I was there for him meant she couldn\u2019t brush her actions off as \u2018anybody would choose what i did\u2019", "I\u2019m a teenager too. I sat out the party to be there for him. Being a teenager doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have any sympathy for the people you\u2019re supposed to care about.", "He did. But regardless I felt if she cared about him, she wouldn\u2019t see taking care of somebody that was upset about their dream falling apart as \u2018moping\u2019.", "I think my choice made her feel more guilty because she saw somebody else treating her bf the way she should have", "Yeah I can kind of get where she is coming from, but at the end of the day she\u2019s in a relationship with another person, and if she feels a party is more important than her partner that\u2019s her decision. If he feels a way about that then maybe they aren\u2019t too compatible anyways.", "That's the good part about it though. Recognizing what you did was wrong is the first step to becoming a better person. I don't know if she can make it up to him but if she can the likelihood of her being that insensitive again is lower.", "She went to a party dude. Teenagers do all kind of self centered things and this don't mean she didn't care for your friend. And how long did your friend remain depressed about his situation...I bet long after the rejection letter. So she would have still had to deal with that? And you still didn't state weather your friend congratulate those ho got in to their colleges of choice Or did he just sulk like the teenager he was.", "Thats fair. I mean id be upset if I was your friend too. But at the same time it's also unfair to ask her to delay a celebration just because her boyfriend didnt get into his first choice ivy league school.", "I mean, in my view it\u2019s fine if you would rather go to a party than support somebody else, but doing that while also wanting to be in a relationship with that person feels like wanting to have a cake and eat it too", ">and if she feels a party is more important than her partner\n\nArjun is the bad friend though, because he thinks his pity party is more important than others too.", "It depends on whether she can come to terms with her guilt or if she keeps blaming it on others. I do hope what yoy saud happens", "> Teenagers do all kind of self centered things\n\nAs in, being TA. And clearly not all or even most teenagers, so it\u2019s a weird blanket statement to make. \n\n> weather your friend congratulate those ho got in \n\nhe did do so, yeah.", "It was not her celebration, it was a celebration for someone else.", "Yeah I totally get what you mean. You can\u2019t have the best of both worlds. You worded this perfectly, this is basically what I meant to say lol but I worded it terribly \ud83d\ude2d", "That is true. Good luck to you and your friend. I hope things work out for him in the end.", "So you and your are thoughtful. How long was he depressed and did he reapply? Still think the girlfriend did nothing wrong. You was there.", "no worries lol i got what you meant", "He became less depressed about Yale over the course of a week but more depressed over the fact his girlfriend didn\u2019t care for him enough to be there. \n\nHe can\u2019t reapply once he\u2019s been rejected. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how being able to go out and enjoy a party while your loved one suffers isn\u2019t wrong and cruel.", "So a dream he had for years he got over but his girl going to the party made him depressed. Was they dating since he was 7. You all was in high school and did he break up with her since she was such a terrible gf that one time he didn't get accepted.", "That\u2019s not an answer to my question\u2014 how is abandoning somebody you\u2019re supposed to love and care for when they need you most not a wrong thing to do? \n\nAlso, never said he got over it, I said he got less depressed over it. \n\nAs for breaking up with her, that\u2019s a terrible argument\u2014 plenty of people feel attached to people that are bad to them.", "She didn't abandon him, she went to a party. You Re both too sensitive. If you said she was a bad girlfriend and did this all the time then maybe I can see where you coming from. One day and one party. Maybe you all should have went to the party too.", "I think we found the gf, or one of her flying monkeys."]}
