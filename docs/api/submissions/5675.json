I arrived on a Thursday and she came on a Wednesday everything was normal and fine. We decided to go to a bar (it\u2019s legal to drink where I\u2019m at) and had a few drinks with her friend and her friend\u2019s cousin. We were listening to music laughing and just generally having a nice time.  After a while we all got pretty drunk and she started talking to us about a guy that she\u2019s been dealing with and how much he\u2019s hurt her feelings because of his general lack of interest in a relationship, this then escalated to her telling us that she was pregnant and had taken a test the day prior. We all freaked out since she\u2019s so young but we were willing to be there for her in every way possible, even though my cousin and I aren\u2019t particularly the closest.\n\nThe next day after we sobered up a bit we went to my grandmas house finally, and all throughout the time we were there all she did was break down in tears because she claimed to be so frustrated and upset, she essentially spent the whole christmas upset and I consoled her throughout it all, she would complain about how pregnancy is bloating her and making her emotional and crying about having to have an abortion to not disappoint her parents. She also asked me to wear her uncomfortable shoes for her, since shes pregnant and everything hurts and I obliged. She also ended up telling the guy she was pregnant and he was worried and frantic because she was ignoring him and he couldn\u2019t get ahold on her. On Christmas day she kept breaking down tears talking about how hard it\u2019s been for her and I of course empathized and we also built a little bit of a bond.\n\nSo on Sunday night I ask her \u201chow far along do you think you are?\u201d And she answers with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and I tell her she should try her hardest to find out as soon as possible. She then starts freaking out and getting anxious since the guy was frantically texting her and I tell her she should just answer and work it out with the father. She then turns to me and says \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to work out, because this is a prank. I lied and took it too far\u201d. I at first didn\u2019t believe her since she lied so well and I confronted her and asked her how could she ever do something like that? She answered with \u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic it was just a prank.\u201d But I honestly after this can\u2019t bring myself to speak to such a manipulative person because her ability to so casually lie, fabricate tears and all that just for attention is scary and I never plan on speaking to her again. She claimed I was being cold and if I wanna stay mad and be cruel that\u2019s fine and she wont chase after me, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1672043637, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvit1x/aita_for_being_afraid_of_my_cousin_and_never/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was no need to extend the so-called prank outside of OP which was already insane, but to then freak this dude out for no reason?
