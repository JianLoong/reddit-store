We all freaked out since she\u2019s so young but we were willing to be there for her in every way possible, even though my cousin and I aren\u2019t particularly the closest.\n\nThe next day after we sobered up a bit we went to my grandmas house finally, and all throughout the time we were there all she did was break down in tears because she claimed to be so frustrated and upset, she essentially spent the whole christmas upset and I consoled her throughout it all, she would complain about how pregnancy is bloating her and making her emotional and crying about having to have an abortion to not disappoint her parents. She also asked me to wear her uncomfortable shoes for her, since shes pregnant and everything hurts and I obliged. She also ended up telling the guy she was pregnant and he was worried and frantic because she was ignoring him and he couldn\u2019t get ahold on her. On Christmas day she kept breaking down tears talking about how hard it\u2019s been for her and I of course empathized and we also built a little bit of a bond.\n\nSo on Sunday night I ask her \u201chow far along do you think you are?\u201d And she answers with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and I tell her she should try her hardest to find out as soon as possible.
