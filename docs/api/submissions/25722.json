She was really vulnerable. And Becky told her not to be sad and it wasn't a big deal, that not everyone was meant to be a mother but every child was meant to have a mother so she should just adopt, like she found happiness with the family that took her in.

I'm not saying homophobic spaces should not be challenged, at all. IDK how else to explain it. Being *homophobic* there is normal. It's in the law, it's in all the religions, it's taught in schools. It's everywhere. I wasn't saying \"homophobia is right and gay people should be suppressed\".

What does Becky's weird religious upbring have to do with your gf's offering to help out. It wasn't like she was saying \"we couldn't be here earlier because we were at church... you should really go to church.... you're going to hell\" or anything like that.... was she? Becky obviously has an issue with your gf that has nothing to do with religion. Could it be she's jealous of your gf for some reason?", "Wait, so Anna thinks because they were gracious with your behaviour during a rough time, that makes your girlfriend fair game for insults and ridicule for no other reason than being religious?

So I guess I misread that.\n\nI can\u2019t really speak further to the conversation since I didn\u2019t hear it\u2026 but I guess my question is, why are you hitting this point of the culture and laws being homophobic? I\u2019m sure they understand that\u2026 What is the larger point you\u2019re trying to make?", "Oh, the commenter suggested that Becky may have resentment towards me over a comment I made months ago. And honestly I'm starting to believe it now after reading this.\n\nShe said it was no surprise soccer players left African countries, because the LGBT are prosecuted there. I said their motivation for leaving was money not social climate because big clubs pay a fuckton.\n\nBut if I wanted to tell them that I'm not homophobic or judging them in any way for their orientation, how would you say this to someone who clearly thinks you already are? In a diplomatic way without getting people heated", "But the commenter also suggested you were telling Becky about the laws / culture in Africa being homophobic, so I\u2019m just wondering how that came up / what point you were trying to make?\n\nAnd I can\u2019t say too much about your relationship or conversations, obviously take this humble Redditor with a grain of salt. But I would just say; it\u2019s great that you want to be supportive / accepting, especially if your original culture is so firmly anti-LGBTQ. (you\u2019re from Africa, correct?) The question maybe shouldn\u2019t be \u2018how do I tell someone I\u2019m not homophonic when they think I am?\u2019 You can be accepting of someone\u2019s sexual orientation and still lack a lot of understanding- you can never FULLY put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes without truly having their experience. Kind of like how when someone says \u2018I\u2019m not racist\u2019 it rarely helps the conversation; almost everyone has culturally instilled biases and habits that can be hurtful or contribute to a sense of otherization, even without realizing it. It\u2019s impossible to recognize and drop them all at once. You can know prejudice is wrong, but unlearning and relearning is an ongoing process. If you\u2019re too focused on proving you\u2019re not homophobic it might be easy to get defensive, which usually isn\u2019t productive. Focusing on empathy and acknowledging there\u2019s plenty to learn, and that you\u2019ll make mistakes, I think is a better mindset. You can mention that you think a big reason athletes are leaving Africa is because of pay without using it to counter the idea that some may be leaving because of homophobia (again, I\u2019m not sure how this conversation really went down). Of course every queer person is different but I think many (unfortunately) expect or are used to a certain amount of microaggressions and misunderstandings. If Anna has been friends with you this long she probably doesn\u2019t just think you\u2019re \u2018homophobic,\u2019 but she could also be practicing patience with some of your behaviors and/or trying to communicate about them. If you think Anna would be comfortable / want to talk about it, she might be the best person to ask if there are things in your relationship she\u2019s struggling with, and what will help her feel more fully accepted by you (not that you should expect her to be able to iron it all out in one conversation).\n\nPart of acceptance is being willing to get called out sometimes\n\nEDIT: Also, if this wasn\u2019t apparent, I\u2019m focusing specifically on the topics in this comment and not the initial AITAH post / scenario", "NTA.
