After you'd said that you'd agreed to ignore Becky's passive aggressive comments in the past, I was half expecting you to tolerate this kind of behaviour. If Becky has some religious related trauma, this is something she needs to address with a therapis, not take it out on a decent person who's done nothing to her.

You've also not made it clear whether you had accepted the BBQ party invite *prior* to your girlfriend asking you to church...?\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  \n\nMaybe your friends Anna/Becky are despicable people (so why aren't you aware of that?), or your girlfriend isn't as innocent in the drama as you claim (you even admit she \"has problems with getting along with people she doesn't know well\"). Either way you're all assholes for blowing up like this.\n\n**--->Also, in another thread you seem to be describing a situation where Becky and Anna were upset about some comments you made that they took as homophobic...?**", "Has Em ever talked about her religion around Anna and Becky? Is Becky maybe self conscious about the age gap between her and your friend group? \n\nEither way it\u2019s NTA.

Absolutely nothing Becky has gone through gives her the right to be terrible to others, and you were in the right for sticking up for your girlfriend. Anna is clearing doing the same, but if she can't understand the problem with how Becky is treating Em then it's hard to see this resolving.", "NTA - you stood up for your  gf, well done, your gf is not the parents that abused her", "NTA!! Becky is way out of line, she doesn't get to project her trauma onto your Gf or anyone else for that matter. That is hers to deal to with. The only thing I would send back is that, she was projecting her trauma onto the wrong person and she owes Gf an apology.", "NTA Anna needs to rein in her child.", "I understand you. What really annoys me is that Em doesn't ever talk about religion until people ask. And half the shit Anna said was unrelated to religion. Called em stuck up for being quiet type, etc. It was just... So fucking hateful.", "It's not. Em hasn't said or done anything like that, or I wouldn't have felt comfortable being so serious with her or introducing her to my friends.", "Because Anna has been a great friend to me, always has been. I feel like I got too emotional and it damaged a good friendship", "I made plans to go to church weeks in advance. The invite came later, but I told her I'd have plans in the morning but would be there in the afternoon, and since we wouldn't do much of the work we paid something for food and drinks.\n\nYes, Em is sort of shy, she's not really good at small talk with people she doesn't know.\n\nThe homophobic comments were because I said soccer players weren't leaving Africa because they were fleeing homophobia, but because it paid better. They took this as me refusing to acknowledge homophobia.", "No, absolutely not. Em never ever talks religion with people. The only person she does this with in the group is with another friend of ours, Yasmun, who's also religious. It's just their thing, I guess and I never pried too deeply. But no Em doesn't. \n\nIDK about Becky's insecurities and honestly I don't feel inclined to care because of how rude she is/has been", "My initial post was taken down because it went over the word limit. This isn't the first time she acted like this, she constantly makes things about herself.\n\nOur friend Y was once talking about how she was sad about her miscarriage and being 40 meant she wasn't likely to have kids so she felt bad for her husband. She was really vulnerable. And Becky told her not to be sad and it wasn't a big deal, that not everyone was meant to be a mother but every child was meant to have a mother so she should just adopt, like she found happiness with the family that took her in. It's not excessively bad, but it was so insensitive.\n\nShe also doesn't like to attend group outings and we do keep inviting her. Then when we talk about how much fun we had doing ABC, she says she feels left out.", "Yeah, I have a friend like Em, she's religious and I'm not. She'll tell me that she can't do something because she's going to church but she never actually talks about religion to me and she's a really nice person. I would do the same thing you've done if anybody started having a go at her.", "You are an immigrant from Africa and said \"it's just general African culture to be unyielding with views of sexuality\" in the sports discussion.  Do you not see how they might have taken your remark?\n\nBottom line, there was already tension between you/Anna/Becky (they banned you from their space, so I'm not getting why you're over there for a BBQ?), and now this religion issue with your girlfriend.\n\nDefinitely ESH, Everybody Sucks Here. You're not a reliable narrator in this.", "We had gotten past that. Anna and I were close, and both of them have come over my house to do our game thing. I don't like to go over to their place, but this was like a group event thing and Anna extended the invite to me and I thought refusing would be in bad taste.\n\n>Do you not see how they might have taken your remark?\n\nI honestly don't see how telling them how African culture works makes me homophobic. It's just how African culture is. It is homophobic. They are unyielding. They criminalize it. \n\nBut I'll accept an ESH"]}
