I invited my family and my bf's family and was overall just making it a nice get together as my family haven't met my bf's family yet. My bf and I were also starting to discuss potentially getting married which is also why I wanted everyone to met up.\n\nFor background, I grew up Mormon and even though I left once I turned 18, my family is still very religious and follow all the customs. The rule that is most important to this story is that Mormons aren't supposed to consume coffee. My family took it as far as banning anything that smelt or tasted like coffee. So coffee flavored jellybeans, coffee flavored lip balm, and even my deodorant that had a coffee and amber smell.\n\nFor my birthday party I wanted to make the main dishes and dessert. I love cooking and baking and was very excited to show my family some recipes I learned since moving out. For the cake I made this rich chocolate cake and it was delicious, but I had put some coffee in it to bring out the chocolate flavor.\n\nI had gone so long without following mormon customs that I completely forgot the whole can't consume coffee thing until an hour before the party started. Upon realization I knew I didn't have time to make another cake without coffee that would still be just as good as the chocolate one. I asked my bf to grab a cake from the store. Anything that even looked as good as the one I made would be fine.\n\nWell my family weren't happy they were served store bought cake while everyone else got my homemade cake. To try and calm them down I explained why they couldn't eat the cake and promised I would make another cake that was just as good without coffee. That cake would be just for them and I would have it ready within a few days. My mom started crying saying that she couldn't believe I forgot about them. Something about how I've strayed so far from God that I don't even follow the rules I was raised with.\n\nI felt really bad because my mom is a really sweet person and I hated to see her cry. I kept trying to comfort her but my dad got mad and left with my mom and most of my siblings. My little brother was the one who stayed behind as he drove himself to the party. He went and got a slice of my cake after my parents left.\n\nI just feel so bad because my parents thought what I did was intentional and I'm now questioning if I really am an asshole in this situation.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684175890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13igcw9/aita_for_buying_a_store_cake_for_my_mormon_family/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry OP.", "NTA- And your mom isn\u2019t sweet if she\u2019s having a crying fit over a cake when it\u2019s not even her birthday. Don\u2019t make her another cake. None of them deserve your cake if they can\u2019t appreciate you providing them a cake to eat that doesn\u2019t go against their beliefs which is above and beyond what you need to even do.", "NTA these people made your birthday about themselves. This is toxic and manipulative  behavior whether intentional or not.", "NTA .. don\u2019t even get me started on the Mormon faith. They\u2019re lucky they got anything..", "NTA. You probably could have served everyone the store bought cake instead of making a big deal out of having two. BUT, the fact your family would default to thinking you did it on purpose to hurt them says quite a bit about their egos and what they think about you. I would go low to no contact with people like that.\n\nETA: I just went back to read that you were **hosting your own birthday party**. How dare they make it all about them?", "Former member of the LDS church here.\n\nThey were more upset about the idea of you breaking the word of wisdom than having a secondary cake for them that wasn't homemade.\n\nNTA. In an ideal world they would say \"thank you for having cake for me that allows me to meet my religious dietary restrictions\" and be done with it.", "NTA\n\nYou could have served them the cake in the knowledge they would never know but you respected their beliefs. So you gt a store cake. What would your mother have preferred?", "NTA, you bought them a coffee-less cake and they still had a religious guilt fit? Cut these toxic people out of your life.", "NTA. \n\nYou explained what had happened, and you just wanted to show them your new skills. Admittedly, this was probably an eye opener for your parents about how grown up and moved on you are, so I'm sure that was an underlying shock for them. \nBut to say that you've fallen from God? Because of a splash of coffee in a cake? No hon. Neither of your cakes deserved that response.", "NTA- you realized you need and alternative cake and made sure they got one. A lot of people would have just not gotten them another dessert or would have lied and not told them there was coffee in it. You're mother is using this as a way to make you feel bag about leaving their religion and is weaponizing their religion against you", "NTA \n\nYou went to the extra length of providing them a cake, that conforms to their religious dietary guidelines despite the fact that neither you, nor your bf and his parents seem to share these restrictions and they thank you for that by throwing a hissy fit and crying and stomping out the door? That was childish behaviour and they just made the whole situation about themselves. \n\nThis should have been your party and if they didn't like the cake, they could have just let it be and still celebrate your birthday and use the opportunity to get to know your bf's family. \n\nAsk yourself...if your parents had invited you and you couldn't eat your mom's homemade cake but your dad quickly went to the store and got an extra pastry/cake just for you, so you would have a treat too and wouldn't feel left out at the party...would you have cried, thrown a tantrum and ran away or thought \"Hey it was so nice that they got me an extra treat because I cannot eat the cake for all the other people\"?", "A \"really sweet person\" won't cry to manipulate you..\n\nNTA", "I find it kind of low of your parents to accuse you of \"forgetting about them\". You simply forgot about Mormon customs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Would they have preferred you serve them the cake without letting them know there was coffee in it? You did what you could with what you had available. You didn\u2019t have time to remake a cake. You could have just said f it, and not even gotten a store bought cake and they would have no cake to eat at all.", "NTA. It was your birthday and they made it about them. I feel like guests have developed a crazy entitlement that blows my mind. \n\nYou seem to be very very sweet and I hate that you had to deal with this. You deserve to be celebrated and I'm sorry you probably didn't feel that way. You got them cake. On your own birthday!! I'm vegan and I never get to eat birthday cake unless it's my own birthday. Never once have I expected to be accommodated in any sense and if I was I would be beyond grateful. I would actually be embarrassed if someone made me a homemade cake on their own birthday.\n\nThis seems to be not about the cake. You say your mom is really sweet but that is unhinged behavior. You will get confirmation that you are NTA here so use that to have a productive conversation with your parents. I would say, hey I love you both but I was really disappointed how you behaved on my birthday, a day to celebrate me. despite being accommodated, your reaction about the cake was not normal and doesn't represent how you raised me to behave. I'm concerned about you and I'm here to talk if you ever need someone to talk to. \n\nFrankly, the cake is a trigger because of the religious crap and they probably feel like they failed as parents because you cook with coffee which is ridiculous and insulting that they can't see the selfless, thoughtful person you are likely due to the stuff that actually matters in parenting.", "Good god no. The babies needed their bottle so you got them a whole new cake all for them. They still fussed and threw a tantrum. It\u2019s flavoring, I am certain a real coffee bean has never been near that delicious sounding cake you made. This is just silly. Your family (except your bro who knows what\u2019s up) sound exhausting. NTA.", "NTA - maybe your mom should have brought you a birthday cake.", "NTA. You could have gotten no replacement cake and then they\u2019d complain they got no cake at all.", "NTA. \n\nPart of my family is Mormon the other isn't.  My wife has made deserts with coffee, and even alcohol that was cooked off.  We would also make, or buy another desert without those things.  They've never been upset, they were just happy we thought of them.", "NTA.  Your dad is.  Sorry former Mormon here.  Your dad didn\u2019t need to leave.  You made an innocent mistake, tried to rectify it and showed respect in doing so.  Seems your mom is sad, which makes sense in the circumstances.  Sounds like she is trying to accept your change about religion but just didn\u2019t have control of her emotions at the moment.  \n\nAlso, who whined about store bought cake and why?   That is not a Mormon thing I ever experience.   They should be grateful for all food offered and for your hospitality.  Anything else is bad manners at best and ungrateful to you and God.  I am sad for you.   And the mom in me is mad too.  I gotta work on that.  You did very well.  I am proud of you and how you handled yourself.  Hugs to you", "NTA- I'm surprised they even went because mormons dont usually do birthday celebrations at all. So their upset over the cake is the least of the issues.\n\nSorry got them mixed up..But still not the A here as you made sure they did have something they could eat.", "NTA- but let\u2019s be real.  You moved out 2 years ago.  You can\u2019t really be serious about \u201cforgetting\u201d about the coffee thing.  You did it on purpose to show how independent you were and then panicked and backed out at the last minute, or planned it just as it turned out.  You knew about their views on coffee, knew they\u2019d be upset, did it anyway.  It doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but it does make you passive aggressive\u2026which isn\u2019t too far off.", "I find it REALLY hard to believe that you \"forgot\" the coffee rule. I feel like you wanted to stir up drama, and you did.", "Lmao Mormons. Glad you left that misogynist hellscape, enjoy your life without having some goober become the bishop of your home just because he was born with dangly bits.", "NAH As an ex mormon and a parent. I understand their hurt. You forgot a major custom that you were raised with for 18 years in a mere 2. That's a record really.   \nI think a better thing to have done was approach them and ask them \"I'm really sorry but I just realised there is coffee in this cake, would you like me to make another, buy another. I'm not sure what to do really as there's only an hour left before the party. Then it would have been their decision in how to proceed and they may have even come up with an idea you had never thought of.   \nTo be honest I think this is just a misunderstanding mixed in with their feelings of the church and you not being apart of that anymore and your feelings for the church leading to why you left.", "YTA\n\nYou don't just forget a food restriction like that. That's like growing up Jewish and forgetting your family doesn't eat pork/shellfish. Or group up Muslim and forgetting your family doesn't consume alcohol.", "Why serve the store cake and the homemade cake? That is your mistake.
