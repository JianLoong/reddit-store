{"id": 17323, "submission_id": "13igcw9", "title": "AITA for buying a store cake for my mormon family?", "selftext": "I (20f) was hosting my own birthday party last week. I invited my family and my bf's family and was overall just making it a nice get together as my family haven't met my bf's family yet. My bf and I were also starting to discuss potentially getting married which is also why I wanted everyone to met up.\n\nFor background, I grew up Mormon and even though I left once I turned 18, my family is still very religious and follow all the customs. The rule that is most important to this story is that Mormons aren't supposed to consume coffee. My family took it as far as banning anything that smelt or tasted like coffee. So coffee flavored jellybeans, coffee flavored lip balm, and even my deodorant that had a coffee and amber smell.\n\nFor my birthday party I wanted to make the main dishes and dessert. I love cooking and baking and was very excited to show my family some recipes I learned since moving out. For the cake I made this rich chocolate cake and it was delicious, but I had put some coffee in it to bring out the chocolate flavor.\n\nI had gone so long without following mormon customs that I completely forgot the whole can't consume coffee thing until an hour before the party started. Upon realization I knew I didn't have time to make another cake without coffee that would still be just as good as the chocolate one. I asked my bf to grab a cake from the store. Anything that even looked as good as the one I made would be fine.\n\nWell my family weren't happy they were served store bought cake while everyone else got my homemade cake. To try and calm them down I explained why they couldn't eat the cake and promised I would make another cake that was just as good without coffee. That cake would be just for them and I would have it ready within a few days. My mom started crying saying that she couldn't believe I forgot about them. Something about how I've strayed so far from God that I don't even follow the rules I was raised with.\n\nI felt really bad because my mom is a really sweet person and I hated to see her cry. I kept trying to comfort her but my dad got mad and left with my mom and most of my siblings. My little brother was the one who stayed behind as he drove himself to the party. He went and got a slice of my cake after my parents left.\n\nI just feel so bad because my parents thought what I did was intentional and I'm now questioning if I really am an asshole in this situation.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Wow thank you for all the comments and support. I just wanted to address a few things about my story that many people are asking. The biggest one is how could I just forget that Mormons can't have coffee? Despite now living in Utah I live in an area that doesn't have a lot of Mormons. I haven't practiced most mormon customs since before I moved out. I think the biggest factor is that I've made this cake so many times before for other birthdays and celebrations that it's ingrained in my memory. My bf was actually the one who reminded me that Mormons can't have coffee after he asked me if I had replaced the coffee with water or something else. I think I just went through the motions without a second thought because I never had to before.\n\nAnother one is that people are mentioning how my parents are mistreating me. I have been lowish contact with my parents for a while. They live across the country and were in town as I only live 2 hours from extended family. I texted my mom asking if we could talk about what happened. No response yet, but I might update if I feel her response is update worthy.\n\nThe final thing that I've seen scattered around is why I didn't have everyone eat the store cake. I'll be honest part of it was my last minute panic that it didn't even cross my mind to do that. I understood now that it was probably a dumb mistake. I'm sure my bf's family would've questioned why my famous chocolate cake wasn't there because I had previously told them the menu I had planned. That was probably the biggest mistake on my part. But I thought that making another cake for just my family would've been okay because I really wanted them to try it. I understand now that having everyone eat the store cake would've been best.", "created_utc": 1684175890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13igcw9/aita_for_buying_a_store_cake_for_my_mormon_family/", "score": 937, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Admittedly, this was probably an eye opener for your parents about how grown up and moved on you are, so I'm sure that was an underlying shock for them. \nBut to say that you've fallen from God? Because of a splash of coffee in a cake? No hon. Neither of your cakes deserved that response.", "NTA- you realized you need and alternative cake and made sure they got one.

Never once have I expected to be accommodated in any sense and if I was I would be beyond grateful. I would actually be embarrassed if someone made me a homemade cake on their own birthday.\n\nThis seems to be not about the cake. You say your mom is really sweet but that is unhinged behavior. You will get confirmation that you are NTA here so use that to have a productive conversation with your parents. I would say, hey I love you both but I was really disappointed how you behaved on my birthday, a day to celebrate me. despite being accommodated, your reaction about the cake was not normal and doesn't represent how you raised me to behave. I'm concerned about how this impacted you and I'm here to talk if you ever need someone to talk to. \n\nFrankly, the cake is a trigger because of the religious crap.

The babies needed their bottle so you got them a whole new cake all for them. They still fussed and threw a tantrum.

You made an innocent mistake, tried to rectify it and showed respect in doing so.  Seems your mom is sad, which makes sense in the circumstances.  Sounds like she is trying to accept your change about religion but just didn\u2019t have control of her emotions at the moment.  \n\nAlso, who whined about store bought cake and why?   That is not a Mormon thing I ever experience.   They should be grateful for all food offered and for your hospitality.  Anything else is bad manners at best and ungrateful to you and God.  I am sad for you.   And the mom in me is mad too.  I gotta work on that.  You did very well.  I am proud of you and how you handled yourself.  Hugs to you", "NTA- I'm surprised they even went because mormons dont usually do birthday celebrations at all. So their upset over the cake is the least of the issues.\n\nSorry got them mixed up..But still not the A here as you made sure they did have something they could eat.", "NTA- but let\u2019s be real.  You moved out 2 years ago.  You can\u2019t really be serious about \u201cforgetting\u201d about the coffee thing.  You did it on purpose to show how independent you were and then panicked and backed out at the last minute, or planned it just as it turned out.  You knew about their views on coffee, knew they\u2019d be upset, did it anyway.

Glad you left that misogynist hellscape, enjoy your life without having some goober become the bishop of your home just because he was born with dangly bits.", "NAH As an ex mormon and a parent. I understand their hurt. You forgot a major custom that you were raised with for 18 years in a mere 2. That's a record really.   \nI think a better thing to have done was approach them and ask them \"I'm really sorry but I just realised there is coffee in this cake, would you like me to make another, buy another. I'm not sure what to do really as there's only an hour left before the party. Then it would have been their decision in how to proceed and they may have even come up with an idea you had never thought of.   \nTo be honest I think this is just a misunderstanding mixed in with their feelings of the church and you not being apart of that anymore and your feelings for the church leading to why you left.", "YTA\n\nYou don't just forget a food restriction like that.

It's because during the journey from Navoo to Provo, there wasn't enough coffee to ration between all the travelers, so the \"higher-ups\" kept it for themselves but convinced everyone else it was unholy and not allowed. \n\nSome Mormons still believe the lie and avoid caffeine in all forms while others pick and choose and even consume alcohol (another no no) and Choffy.\n\nNTA by the way", "NTA. In relation to your edit,You enjoy baking, you wanted the people who could be able to eat your cake, why would you take it off the menu completely just because a handful of others couldn't eat it. It sounds like a genuine mistake and you are being punished disproportionately for it. If your little bro took a slice on the quiet I wonder how long it will be before he steps back from your parents too, as he obviously isn't as devout as them and they probably won't like that!", "Ooh, I think I might know which cake you're talking about. Is it possibly the one from Damn Delicious? \n\nExtra NTA, in that case. It's my go-to because it's *so* good.", "Oh my god, is that true? That's hilarious.", "Lol\n\n\nYou nailed it."]}
