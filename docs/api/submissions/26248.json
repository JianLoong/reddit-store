I get that you're tired of them fighting but are you really ok with your dad being left with nothing because your parents were annoying?", "NTA but contemplated saying YTA with this, the \"just get a nice divorce, it's not that hard.\" was so annoying.

It's fine to hear about it sometimes as long as your parents are respecting your boundaries. \n\nI told both parent and step parent that I would stop communication if I was involved in their 'he said she said' complaints, and only my step parent managed to steam roll my boundary so badly that I cut communication.", "NTA - Even if you are an adult, your parents should not use their children as messengers/pawns/referees or anything else in their divorce.
