They have no business dragging you into *their* problem here.\n\nStop trying to help. You're only making the matter worse. You need to set a firm boundary: If your parents bring up the divorce, you will first remind them that you will not discuss the divorce with them and then, the second time in the conversation, you'll say goodbye and hang up the phone.\n\nYou will not respond to emotional blackmail about the topic either. You will not respond to texts or emails that even mention the divorce, even if they also talk about other things.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, okay I'll let \"mom or dad's\" lawyer know.", "You're NTA, but there's something very important you're overlooking: by saying \"leave me out of it\" and refusing to get involved, you have still made a choice. Your bond with your mother and father will likely change in the coming years because of this. As long as you are willing to accept that, then everything's good. But be aware that things can't stay the same as they have been.", "You\u2019re not in the wrong for standing up for yourself. It\u2019s their divorce; they need to leave you out of it and get assistance working things out if they need it. It\u2019s not fair to you for one to try to convince the other through you.", "NTA.

My primary rule (to myself) is not to involve her. I don\u2019t even keep her up to date on what\u2019s happening. It doesn\u2019t concern her. I try not to say bad things about her father; she knows the situation, she\u2019s not stupid. It\u2019s about the parents not the kids and it\u2019s completely wrong of your parents to involve you in any way whatsoever. If they\u2019re not getting the message from you, perhaps there\u2019s another family member who could make them understand - and aunt/uncle? \nI\u2019m sorry this is happening, but you\u2019re completely in the right and they\u2019re acting childish. Divorce brings out the best or the worst in us.", "NTA. My parents are both good people. They separated when I was 21. At first, I tried to play the role of mediator communicating with each of them. I realized their biggest problem was just poor communication and believing the worst intentions of each other. \n\nFor example, my mom did not invite my dad to Thanksgiving the first year they separated. She assumed he wouldn\u2019t want to go because it was her year to host her family (that he didn\u2019t have a great relationship with) and she thought he wouldn\u2019t want to go anyways and she didn\u2019t want to put him in the awkward position of saying no. He thought she was snubbing him and cutting him out of our lives. \n\nEventually, it got to the point where I was constantly trying to explain my dad\u2019s reasoning to my mom and my mom\u2019s reasoning to my dad for every little thing. My parents would argue with me as if they were arguing with each other. Eventually, I told them both I was no longer going to speak with either of them about each other and my relationship with both of them became much better. \n\nSpare yourself!!!", "I expected OP to younger, as parents getting divorces sometimes use younger kids as weapons in nasty divorces.\n\nI suppose if they had petty fights their entire marriage, then it's no surprise the divorce is going to be nasty. However, to drag kids in the middle of it is irresponsible parenting.\n\nOne thing in a firm believer in is that,  kids no matter the age should be protected as much as possible in a divorce proceeding. Yes, if kids are old enough explain to them...but you never ever put the burden on your kids, like OPS parents are doing and you never put the kids inbetween a fight.", "I\u2019ve had divorced parents for 20 years and they constantly try and make me think the other is some sort of devil. It gets tiring fast", "Infinity percent", "GODS So much this. I have trust issues to this day because of my parents divorce and the s\\*\\*t they pulled when I was 9. I am 40 now. Each one did petty vindictive c\\*\\*p to try to hurt each the other and ended up hurting me and my sibling the most. Each one tried to use us against the other and get them \"on their side\". \n\nOP stay the hell out of it. Go LC if you have to because their behavior will not get better if they feel they can \"win\" with your  help.

No one is asking her to figure out the dads legal defense, they're asking her to essentially testify( not sure if that's the word in divorce court).
