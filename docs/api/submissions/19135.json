Her being abused, especially with two young children, is a horrific thing, and it seems incredibly callous of you to not care about this woman's safety or her two children because you're not 100% sure if she is actually your sister. I'm not saying she needs to move in with you, but to not even be willing to speak to her and telling her so while she's struggling like that seems awful to me. Being trapped by an abusive partner is terrifying and isolating. Many abusers purposefully ruin your relationships with friends and family to give you no way out.

There are so many ways to help her without paying money or offering a place to stay, etc. Just being kind can make all the difference.", "NTA. It\u2019s a logical and reasonable request.

Not because you are suggesting they are terrible people but simply because they are unknowns. \n\nOn the other hand, your dad accepts her as his child, regardless of whether she is biologically his. He's had a 10 year relationship with her. That will probably not go away regardless of blood test results. So think of her for now like a step sister? You two haven't always been family and may not be blood family, but your father chose to make her part of his family so you are connected through him regardless anyway. Would you be willing to perhaps meet with her, just to get superficially acquainted a bit? You could let her know that you appreciate her curiosity, but for you this is as deep it you feel able to get without a blood test. It's a compromise where she gets a chance to meet someone who has been a mystery for her, and it's up to her whether she wants to pursue potential for more connection at the expense of taking a gamble on what may be revealed by a DNA test. It has to be terrifying to wonder whether she might lose trust in her mother and lose the man she believes to be her father. It's a big leap that you're asking her to take, and I think it would be kind of you to take that into consideration a bit more. Just food for thought. You don't owe her a meet.

It also makes sense that you\u2019re asking, because you have no way of knowing whether she or her mom are lying.  You *are* accusing her and/or her mom of that, though.

Hope he doesn't have a big estate", "My dad is an adulterer. Always has been. He got a vasectomy in '96, so I have no younger siblings besides my full blood younger sister born the same year, but he's even mused about the fact that he could have a kid or two out there from his time in the military, even when he was married to his first wife. So it's v possible I have a half sibling or two out there.\n\nMy point being, OP's dad admitted to the affair. Sure, DNA tests are helpful in that case, but how would it be a surprise with such little likelihood that proof is necessary before proceeding when the father has literally admitted to having at least one affair?\n\nLike, again, get the DNA test (and for *everyone*, if one person's paternity is questionable in a group of siblings, so is everyone's), but it's not surprising when the guilty party admits to being guilty?", "No-one is entitled to a DNA test either. OP's Dad has a accepted this for over a decade. Might be news to his other kids but he's been playing Pop and Pop-Pop for a good while.\n\nWhy don't they *all* get DNA tests  just to make it fair?", "She\u2019s acting like Anastazia Romanov.", "This was my thought too.", "Gross. Phrasing.", "Pay for the test and also get one themselves. Because if proving paternity is nbd, then OP and his full bio sibling can do it, too, no issues.", "I was looking for this one. It's well reasoned and reflects actually interacting with people in a complicated relationship. Contrary to Reddit and daytime TV, people don't usually run around demanding paternity testing from people that they might meet.", "Because OP is grasping at straws in the hope that her sister is not really her sister.", "The half-sister is 33, and Dad found out 10 years ago she existed. That means 24ish years after his affair he got a shocking surprise. Don't know about you, but if someone appeared on my doorstep claiming to be my kid after almost a quarter century, you'd better believe I'd need a DNA test to confirm it.\n\nIf he is willing to accept her as his daughter with no DNA test, that's his business. And it's OP's business whether to accept it or not. They are very reasonably choosing not to until a DNA test confirms it. They are separate relationships.\n\nIt's almost like you all never watched Maury Povich. I know it's tv and you need to take it with a grain of salt, but how many people swear up and down that someone is the parent only for DNA to show they aren't? Why not be sure?", "Why would they take a DNA test? And just because the dad wants to accept blindly doesn't mean the siblings must. I don't think there is anything wrong with asking for the \"sister\" to take the test just to be sure. Who knows who else the mother could have been sleeping with around the same time? (No slut shaming, it just happens.)", "\u201csister\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Genetically, eye color is controlled by a ton of different genes, so it's not quite that straightforward as you may have learned in biology class! Brown eyes have lots of melanin, blue eyes have none. Green eyes are somewhere in the middle, so it's definitely reasonable for a blue eyed and brown eyed person to have a child with green eyes. And blood type it's also explainable. If both mom and dad are type AO, then there is a 75% chance they have a child with A type blood, and a 25% chance of O.", "From what we know, she's the child of her mother, not necessarily the child of OP's father. Just because the two were having an affair doesn't necessarily mean that OP's father was the mother's only partner at the time.\n\nOnly the DNA test would clear that up.", "That would still require the step sister to do it also. Ancestry can't magically tell you that you have a long-lost sibling if that person hasn't also had the testing done. \n\nUnless you're suggesting that OP's dad may also have other children that they don't know about? Even then, the only way to know is if the dad's other kid/kids had also signed up for the same genealogy testing service.", "Sure, but hopefully dad communicated that it's the half-siblings that want a DNA test.\n\nSince they owe her nothing she can take the deal or leave it, that's all on her now.", "Going out on a limb here but perhaps because no one requested it?", "Did you sneeze while typing that?", "At least \"Anastasia Romanov\"'s path in HOI4 lets you crown a bear as King of Poland.", "That's the joke.", "They are the only ones wanting it so they should pay for it.", "If they\u2019re demanding proof then they should be willing to provide the same.  After all, their father cheated so their mother could have done the same.\n\nTheir father would be in the best position to know if she was his, and has pretty much accepted that for over a decade.", "I get that. My point was that I wouldn\u2019t consider it a red flag that she believes her mom , especially when \u201cdad\u201d clearly believes her mom. She may not have thought to question her paternity prior to this conversation.", "The post said: \u201cdad has accepted her as his\u201d so it\u2019s the dad\u2019s kid. \n\n\nAlso, If OP grew up with his mom in the same house as him I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s the dad\u2019s affair kid. How do you hide an entire pregnancy and newborn from the whole family?? The one brother would have been like 6-7 years old from the ages in the post.", "I think it's an excellent idea.\n\nLet's see everyone's paternity, it would make this girl feel less doubted and singled out.\n\nJust rhe suggestion would make OP realize how he's making the half'sibling feel. He's basically calling her and her Mom fakes and liars who are on the make. \n\nHe's horrified at her domestic drama  while forgetting that she is actually a product of *his family's* domestic drama and sexual incontinence. \n\nThe Dad knows where he repeatedly stuck his unwrapped dick as a bit of extra recreational while married to their mother, so apparently that's good enough for him \n\nNot that the DNA test isn't a good idea. But potential half-sib refusing it isn't necessarily a bad sign. It's just kind of uncomfortable and insulting to be asked to prove something which has been settled for a decade. \n\nI say they all do full 23 and me  just for shits and giggles.", "Hey that's funny!\n\nCheck out our usernames!", "This. She's obviously not in a good situation, it's unfair to ask her to pay for something only they want.", "Yeah but the person is the one claiming to be the half-sibling. If you are going to claim something, you gotta foot the bill to prove it.", "They could absolutely have a relationship with her but they aren't wrong for wanting to know for sure if that is their sister or not.", "Their father was a cheater so the mother is too? Sound logic. However! I do think that all 3 of them doing the test together would be a good start to bonding.\n\nAnd there are stories on here all the time about \"I raised a kid who turned out not to be mine\" so I don't think that the father necessarily should be trusted. Plus, using the logic from your first sentence, her mother could have been sleeping with multiple men too. \n\nTo summarize, all 3 should get tested. Who knows what kind of surprises can come out of it lol", "I agree, as far as I can tell everyone in this family has good reason to doubt the lies of the parents, so 23 and me for everyone!", "She is a stranger to them. They have no reason to trust her. Also it sounds like he is only talking for him and his sister so they would be comfortable building a relationship with this stranger.", "Ok? No one is wrong here", "Except dear ol' dad."]}
