Her being abused, especially with two young children, is a horrific thing, and it seems incredibly callous of you to not care about this woman's safety or her two children because you're not 100% sure if she is actually your sister. I'm not saying she needs to move in with you, but to not even be willing to speak to her and telling her so while she's struggling like that seems awful to me. Being trapped by an abusive partner is terrifying and isolating. Many abusers purposefully ruin your relationships with friends and family to give you no way out. The more people who believe her and are present for her, the harder it is for him to maintain control. There are so many ways to help her without paying money or offering a place to stay, etc. Just being kind can make all the difference.", "NTA. It\u2019s a logical and reasonable request.

Not because you are suggesting they are terrible people but simply because they are unknowns. \n\nOn the other hand, your dad accepts her as his child, regardless of whether she is biologically his. He's had a 10 year relationship with her. That will probably not go away regardless of blood test results. So perhaps think of her for now like a step sister...? That is, you two haven't always been family and may not be blood family, but your father chose to make her part of his family so you are connected through him regardless. Would you be willing to perhaps meet with her, just to get superficially acquainted a bit? You could let her know that you appreciate her curiosity, but for you this is as deep it you feel able to get without a blood test. It's a compromise where she gets a chance to meet someone who has been a mystery for her, and it's up to her whether she wants to pursue potential for more connection at the expense of taking a gamble on what may be revealed by a DNA test. It has to be terrifying to wonder whether she might lose trust in her mother and lose the man she believes to be her father. It's a big leap that you're asking her to take, and I think it would be kind of you to take that into consideration a bit more. Just food for thought. You don't owe her a meet.

Get proof of blood before going further. She can be hurt, not your problem. Resistance to do so is a bit of a red flag to me.", "NTA - I know this isn't why you suggested the test, but I simply don't understand why she wouldn't want to get a DNA test.

It is understandable that she feels hurt, and it\u2019s understandable that she is communicating that.  It also makes sense that you\u2019re asking, because you have no way of knowing whether she or her mom are lying.  You *are* accusing her and/or her mom of that, though.
