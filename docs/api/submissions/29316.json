We even risked losing our apartment because it belonged to my sister and they threatened to take it.\n\nWe suddenly got into a huge crisis and had crazy monetary problems.

It's sad how she always tries to make us compete for whoever pleases her the most. Been a thing since forever.", "That's true but I'm learning a foreign language (German) and I'll still be living with parents even while having a job so I could save up and move to Germany in a few years.", "Yeah I did. She knows it. My mom has both my dad's and my sisters credit cards and can control and see how much money is spent/added to the credit card.", ">Why were you and your parents giving your sister money if you knew she was gambling?\n\nThat's a great question that I gave an answer to but was told my post was too long so I cut it. So no we didn't know she was gambling or was in debts obviously. She kept it all secret for months on end. She simply said she needed money to invest and made us do online face scans all that stuff to lend the money. We had thousands of calls from random banks and micro credit organisations who kept threatening us non stop the whole time. When my parents already knew about the massive debts my sister cried and asked all in tears my dad to lend another few thousands dollars to help close some of more important debts. My dad believed her... And it turned out that she simply gambled all those money away and didn't even try to close off the already massive debts. To say he was hurt is to say nothing here. He still has to pay for all this from his own pocket. That's exactly why i felt bad for them initially and wanted to work to help them out.\n\n>were you in university during this issue?\n\nYes! I graduated this July.", "That sounds incredibly unhealthy not only for your relationship with her but for your relationship with your sister too.", "So, if you're living there you should be contributing, regardless of how rude your mother is (she is, obviously) otherwise you are just freeloading. You are an adult, it is within their rights to say get out, find your own way, if you refuse to help out.", "NTA. I think you should take your mom up on her suggestion and move out as soon as you get a job that lets you do so. Also, why hasn't your sister cancelled that card of her's your mom has? Or at least frozen it so it can't be used?", "1) OK LOL if ur in uni then it becomes even less realistic for them to expect you to get a job (even if you do get one it is not going to pay for anything skull)  \n\n\n2) so uhh.. at the start this is her issue only, but after your parents find out that she needs more money, they also become AH by enabling her further. She has broken trust and from then on she shouldn't be given more financial aid. Honestly seems like the only person not AH is you here", "But it's great that we love each other unconditionally and I will never think of myself as 'better' or 'worse'. I admire her for who she is and she admires me for who I am. None of my mom's 'she is slimmer/younger/smarter than you' will ever make us compete or be jealous or some other stupid stuff \ud83d\ude02", "It's fine that our mom uses the money. It's just not fine she can see how much we spend on our own since she has some 'jealousy' and does not like when we spend too much on our own enjoyment.", "That's good to hear, it definitely sounds like your mother's love is conditional.", "You really need to move out or quit bitching"]}
