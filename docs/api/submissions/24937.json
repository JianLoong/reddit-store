Here are some relevant quotes: \n\n> The positive effects of a vegan diet on health determinants cannot be proven, but there are relevant risks regarding nutritional deficiencies. Children and pregnant women are advised against adopting a vegan diet due to the risks described above.\n>\n> The scientific evidence available to date is not sufficient to claim that vegan and vegetarian diets are associated with a significant reduction of total mortality. \n>\n>  Since rejecting any animal foods increases the risk of nutrient deficiencies and thus of health disorders, a vegan diet is not recommended by the DGE during pregnancy or lactation, or for children or adolescents of any age.\n>\n> The committee considers that the vegan diet is inappropriate and therefore not recommended for unborn children, children and adolescents, as well as pregnant and lactating women.\n\nAdditionally, there's another interesting component to why the countries listed advocate against it and the UK does not. Most of the countries I listed \u2013 with one exception we'll touch on in a moment \u2013 follow EU regulations, which state that nutrients \"cannot be used as a substitute for a varied diet\" under Article 5(1) of Directive 2000. All supplements are required under law to bear this labeling. If supplements, such as B12, have to inform the consumer that they are not legally recognized as a substitute for B12 found in the diet, it makes perfect sense that the diet would be recommended against by pediatric boards. Adults can make their own decisions, which is probably why they draw the distinction. \n\nOf course, Switzerland is not part of the EU either, but has adopted similarly strict regulations about supplement labeling. The NHS takes a different stance, which recommends certain supplements to the entire population, as well as specific daily supplements for all children (regardless of diet).", "As an Indian-American, I kinda call bullshit on this.

The priority is your baby's well being, if he was hungry and spaghetti with picked off meat was the only thing he wanted to eat at the time, then your husband needs to get out of his feelings and let his baby eat. And this is coming from me, a vegetarian since I was a kid.", "Why is your husband more willing to let his infant son go hungry than to let him eat meat? \nThe baby is finally happy with a full stomach, and your husband is whining and throwing a tantrum over the kid wanting different food. A good parent would sacrifice anything for their kid, something as tiny as this shouldn't matter to him. \nFed is best. Who's the child, again?", "NTA\n\n>He feels feeding him meat as a baby/toddler would be without his informed consent (I\u2019m paraphrasing - this conversation happened before we started solids and can\u2019t remember specifics).\n\nThis is a complicated issue, but I'd recommend learning a bit more about nutrition and feeding him what would be healthiest for him. I'm no expert. However, my mother tried to raise me as a vegetarian. She was single during the first few years of my life. Anytime we'd go to visit my grandparents, or to a restaurant or buffet, I would eat as much meat as I could. I really craved it back then. And then, my mom eventually started dating and then married my stepdad. That man grew up on a traditional American diet, and began cooking meat at home. Once I was eating meat regularly, I stopped going insane over it when offered outside of the home.\n\nNow that I've learned a little bit more about nutrition, I suspect that I probably had some kind of nutrient deficiency when I was a toddler due to not eating meat.\n\nNow, the informed consent deal in the quote I referenced above is not cool. That's some kind of weird projection from the dad, or imposition of a stupid ideology. You need to just feed your son what will be healthy for him. I don't know what that is, but I suspect meat is or will be important for him to consume at some time during his maturation.", "NTA. You do whatever you have to do to get your kid to eat. Period. Also, it\u2019s a lot harder to start eating meat after YEARS of being vegetarian than it is to become vegetarian after years of eating meat. Don\u2019t restrict food from your children.", "NTA something's better than nothing, and your husband needs to get some fucking perspective if he thinks eating meat is the same as eating *literal fucking glass!*", "NTA! At one year old his little body is telling him what it needs. My older daughter went through a phase where she\u2019d only eat saltines and milk. With the younger it was Mac and Cheese. Both grew up just fine and make their own dietary choices. My grandsons also went through their picky phase, and grew out of it. Forcing your (actually your husband\u2019s) arbitrary choices on him will only cause problems.", "NTA, a fed baby is a happy baby. Is it perfect for your husband? No, but your baby is fed and that's what's important", "Dear lord, can we care about the childs needs instead of making it about personal politics?\n\nNTA, keep on keeping your child well fed, your husband is the reason vegetarians/vegans have a bad reputation!", "NTA. Your kid will grow up stronger than his father.", "And? Worst case scenario is the kid likes the meat and wants to have a more normal diet", "At a year old, it\u2019s all uniformed consent, man. \n\nNTA. You want an underweight baby or a happy and full baby?", "NTA. Your husband is a nutjob.", "A vegan and a vegetarian jump off a cliff to see who gets to the bottom faster. Who wins? \n\nSociety", "Let\u2019s add the fact that they\u2019re traveling and he\u2019s 16 months!?!? If he won\u2019t let him eat what he\u2019s reaching for then dad has to deal with fallout and find a solution. If you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re partner is doing to your child stand up for it, compromise, or leave.", "5 out of 4 kids would complain that you're feeding them vegetables without their consent, given the opportunity. \ud83d\ude01", "Yep!", "I honestly didn\u2019t realise there was pasta there till another kid was eating it. There was a large roast pig on the table of meat, which I avoided, and the pot of pasta was next to it.  Also vego food was provided to us on a separate table which he refused. I brought packet food which he normally likes but he refused. I offered bread as my kid lives off carbs and he refused. The food I made couldn\u2019t be brought into the country due to quarantine restrictions so mostly eaten in transit and tossed on arrival. I brought mini cartons of milk but my kid had an issue with it not being the straw he likes so wouldn\u2019t have more than a few sips. Sigh. He was having a hard time after flying it seemed and the appearance of pasta with meat at the end of the day was his one thing that he chose.", "Vegetarian here, not vegan. My boy eats a helluva lot of cheese ha", "Correct. He eats cheese and eggs aplenty", "Quite. NTA.", "Key word here is *\"some\"* people. *Some* people have issues after years of vegan or vegetarian lifestyles going back to being omnivores. Many people do not have any issues at all.", "Actually its pretty normal. Its just that the folks who have issues going back to being omnivores talk about it more. Plenty of people have no problems reintroducing meat into their diet.", "No idea what those things are tbh sorry, I'm from Australia", "If he wants it and then eats it, he is consenting.  Your husband\u2019s argument to essentially starve your child for moral reasons is ridiculous.  Toddlers can sometimes be notoriously picky and many pediatricians will tell you to feed them what they will eat.  You\u2019re trying to ensure your child is nourished.  NTA.", "NTA IMO, but ultimately , you and your husband need to get on the same page.", "NTA. The stance your husband is taking is concerning. He's putting his principles above his son's most basic needs. \n\nKeep feeding your child. It's not an easy task and fed is always the best option. You're doing the best you can.", "NTA\nYour husband is prepared to let your child grow hungry because it\u2019s more important to him to maintain his militant stand against meat than it is to ensure the survival of your child.", "This is silly. You quite obviously are NTA. The kid is a child and you are it's mother. Make a decision, stick with it and to hell with everyone else!", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is though for imposing his dietary preferences on a toddler. Your child needs all the nutrients to grow and develop properly. Your husband's argument about the baby not having informed consent is BS because following that train of thought, you two did not ask the baby's consent for him to be born into your family either. Tell your husband to stop his foolishness and act like an actually parent who cares for the well-being of his child. Denying your child food is negligent parenting and you should be prepared to fight for your kid and leave him or report him to child services if need be.", "NTA, your husband is the equivalent of putting a dog on a vegan diet. Your baby is naturally an omnivore. Forcing a diet on a picky child for the sake of his own ideology is going to do more harm than good in both nutrition and their relationship with food.", "NTA. But, and I never thought I'd say this, as the concept of not eating meat is disgusting to me, are you willing to feed him meat all the way to adulthood? If not, it's probably best to get him used to not eating it in a healthy manner now.", "YTA\nYou give him meat, he will develop a taste for it.\n\n\nThis is a decision that should have been made together. This is something important to your husband and you spontaneously reneged with no discussion.\n\nAs a lifelong veg your husband should know to ask the kitchen for a bowl of sauceless pasta.", "something is wrong w your husband NTA", "NTA. Out of curiosity, how do you think his guts are going to feel if he tries a hamburger when he\u2019s 13, and has never been allowed meat?  Forcing a restrictive diet at an early age seems like it\u2019s going to absolutely suck for him if he doesn\u2019t want to follow it when he\u2019s older and informed. \nLet him eat, get the necessary calories, build a tolerance for different foods, and be healthy. There\u2019s time for him to choose a restrictive diet when he\u2019s older.", "Someone i used to work with decided on a vegan diet for their child when she was born.", "This is a myth. I say this both as an MD and as someone who was vegetarian for 12 years. You might get indigestion if you eat a lot of meat suddenly (just as you might if you suddenly switched to eating lots of fava beans) but you don\u2019t lose the ability to digest it entirely. There were only very small amounts of meat in the sauce, the kid is able to digest that amount of protein. Also anecdotally, I didn\u2019t eat meat for 12 years and my first meat after I became an omnivore again was a half pound burger which I digested just fine. People can have issues eating a lot of meat suddenly but everyone is different. Lastly, indigestion beats starvation even if he did eat a large amount of meat and got indigestion", "I was raised vegetarian but around age 17 I tried a burger for the first time. Didn\u2019t upset my stomach at all. I\u2019m sure some people may have issues but it\u2019s not a universal truth.", "A friend gave up gluten because she thought she had celiac and then after a couple years confirmed that she does not have celiac.  Guess what? Gluten now instead of her feeling uncomfortable like it used to now makes her incredibly ill.", "I'm also Indian American, vegetarian and the few times I accidentally eat meat it's made me pretty sick. And I wasn't even raised vegetarian, I've only been fully veg for like half my life"]}
