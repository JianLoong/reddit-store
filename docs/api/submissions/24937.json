I say this as someone who doesn't eat meat myself- your husband is being irrational. Your small child was hungry and doesn't yet have the capacity to understand why he \"can't\" have something. You weren't in a situation where you had a lot of choices and your child's well being should come first. You're going to get a lot of silly trolling comments about how vegans are the worst but that's not the issue here - the issue is about showing an appropriate level of flexibility so that your kid doesn't go hungry.", "NTA. Let the child eat what the child wants to eat. \n\nAlso, your husband's argument that feeding the child meat would be without their informed consent is nonsense because he's happy to force vegetarianism on him without his consent.", "Nta your husband is ta for trying to force your kid to be a vegetarian like its some cult/religion\n\n\nAnd hes an idiot for comparing eating spaghetti with meat sauce with eating marbles", "NTA. he's trying to force your kid to be vegan and with all honesty comparing eating meat to eating marbles is idiotic.", "NTA - I was raised vegetarian, however my children will not be, the restrictive diet gave me a food complex while all my friends were eating meet I would have to eat vegetables , not being allowed certain things at kids birthday parties ect, it\u2019s easier to be raised eating everything and trying new things then deciding if you want to cut things from your diet rather than the restricting foods and then trying new ones", "NTA. Kids have different nutritional needs. Your husband needs to chill out. He had a right to be vegan but he shouldn\u2019t impose that on an infant. Also texting on his phone and giving you the silent treatment is seriously immature.", "NTA\n\nIt is actually better raising your child with plenty of variety in their diet including meat then they can make the decision when their older.\n\nIf they never have meat then decide to try it or have meat in their diet when they're older then there is a good chance they will have trouble digesting it as they've never had it.", "NTA - when it comes to children and toddlers, fed is best. You did whatever was needed to keep your child healthy and your husband needs to chill.\n\nHowever, you are both wrong for forcing your child to be vegetarian. Please consult with a pediatrician to make sure the child isn't having any vitamin deficiency problems from this diet.", "NTA\n\nI am all for being veggie (am one myself) but if your kid is starving himself and has decided he wants to eat something. You were right to do it.\n\nYou should look into ways to nip the fussy eating in the bud sooner rather than later (not saying it will be easy) It will save many of these dramas in the future.", "NTA. The child needed to eat. He wasn\u2019t even trying to get candy or unhealthy food, he was reaching for something completely normal and at this point necessary.\n\nYour husband is, on the other hand, completely out of place. Silent treatment? What is he, 12?", "NTA. Your husband is unreasonable and ridiculous. You didn't feed the kid meat, just pasta that you pulled meat out of. Also, in the grand scheme you kid needs protein. If he's refusing other types of protein but will eat meat, let him. It's unrealistic to control your child's diet to this level when you have a restrictive lifestyle and are constantly around folks who don't share that. Fed is best and if your self righteous husband would rather have a hungry or starving baby than one that has eaten meat I think you have some serious issues to work out.", "No. NTA. This isnt remotely a close one.", "NTA.\n\nWith children of all ages there\u2019s only one core principal when it come to food - fed is best.\n\nSo as long as your son isn\u2019t actively endangering himself with the food he puts in his mouth (think marbles as your husband has mentioned or known allergens), he can and should have whatever, especially if he proactively asks for it himself.\n\nYou said it yourself - he\u2019s a picky eater, so him actively choosing a new food item is huge progress. You should encourage it, not restrict it.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna wade into the whole \u201cdon\u2019t make your kid a vegetarian\u201d debate, that\u2019s above my pay grade. As long as the kid is fed nutritious food - he\u2019s fed, end of story. And vegetarian diet is no worse than feeding you kid exclusively junk food, which many picky eaters\u2019 parent eventually succumb to.", "NTA. A fed child is more important than adherence to a particular diet. If he can eat and get nutrients and be happy, that's what matters most. He's also clearly showing his consent by reaching for the pasta!", "The kid made a decision about what he wants to eat and the father is the AH for not respecting that. You? NTA. I like you attitude. :)", "NTA. Sounds like he is making his choice and your husband just doesn't like it.", "NTA.  What part of hungry baby doesn't your husband get?  You have to feed your child!  If he only wants something that has meat in it then oh well, he gets the meat.  It is abusive to let a child go hungry because HE has a problem with eating meat.  Your son may be a carnivore at heart or he could decide later to be vegetarian but right now he's HUNGRY!", "NTA.  \n\nYour first priority to your child is to feed him. Specific types and varieties of food preferred by your husband is a secondary concern. You tried what your husband wanted (funny how HE wasn't involved in that), it didn't work.  What, were you supposed to force your child to starve because he didn't care about the meat?\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with two toddlers. At least one of them will grow up.", "Nta - so he'd rather a baby go hungry instead of feeding him??? That's crazy", "Technically you are making the baby a vegetarian without his informed consent so that argument is pointless.", "YTA for forcing a kid on a diet humans are not supposed to be on. Double YTA for the husband who's acting like a religious freak.", "ESH maybe your husband is inflexible but you're basically pissing all over his convictions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've heard of some children never being allowed to try any meat until they were old enough to go to sleepovers at other friends houses, having very bad bathroom experiences after consuming meats while out of their parents gaze because their stomach didn't know how to handle having it. I also personally knew one person who had never more than fish \"meat\" having a very bad reaction to jerky while on a camping trip because she had allergies to beef and didn't know it until then.\nYour husband is waving a pretty big flag \ud83d\udea9 if his first thought is to demand his way only and then go silent when all your trying to do is make sure baby is fed.", "NTA.

Right now OP wants her kid to eat. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for letting your child eat pasta when you picked the meat out of it. I don\u2019t think the child is going to have negative affects from that. Your husband is an asshole for trying to hold out and not let your kid eat because meat had been cooked in there, but you pulled it out. Then he should go cook some pasta himself make sure there\u2019s nothing in it and he can feed that to the kid himself because he\u2019s the asshole. He should also take care of the child who\u2019s prob fussy from everything, while cooking the plain pasta on a boat. He can have fun with that. Also he\u2019s being rude to hosts.", "this is the thing- OP basically doesn't care either way but she admits her  nor her husband can cook meat (and honestly why should they cook meat if they are both vegetarian) but she is open to letting the child eat what he wants which is fine.
