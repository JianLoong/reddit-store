As I am squeamish, I take the craving a sign I am in need of some of its nutrients.\n \nIt is likely your son will choose to be vegetarian when he is older. He is probably even more likely to stick with being a vegetarian if you don't limit him now and let him make the decision himself. \n\nGetting meat locally from responsible ranchers with ethical practices might help, too.", "NTA. Kids should not be forced to be vegetarians in the first place. \nAlso you both decided that if he wants to eat meat he can. He literally asked for it. There should be no issues anyways.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s attitude about \u201cinformed consent\u201d is way off \u2014 you should be waiting to let him choose to restrict his diet when he\u2019s old enough to give informed consent, not restricting it for him until then. \n\nLet him eat the spaghetti sauce.", "NTA. A fed baby is a fed baby.", "NTA. Childhood is when people \u201cneed\u201d meat the most. You can absolutely have healthy vegetarian children but it\u2019s hard to get them all the nutrients they need without meat especially if they aren\u2019t consuming dairy and eggs.", "This pisses me off.  Your husband is 100% an asshole.  Your child was starving.  He's not eating anything & your husband wants to refuse him the 1 food he'll eat?  He would rather starve your child than feed him meat?  That's fucked up.  I'm a vegetarian, but I raised my kids on meat & let them decide if they wanted to be a vegetarian.  You can't deny your child a certain food that he wants to eat just bc you don't eat it.   NTA", "Your husband is TA. Is he really talking about \"informed consent\" in regards to what is fed to a toddler? That's simply insane.", "Plus as far as I know you need to develop the enzymes to properly digest meat or something similar in early childhood, otherwise it won't be an easy adjustment at all layer on, is that correct?", "This man is very selfish. It's all about his wants and not what is best for his (hungry) son. As a vegetarian myself, I think parents should offer a varied diet until the child themselves decide if they want to eat meat or be vegetarian/vegan.", "At this age, everything they decide for the kid is without his informed consent. What a stupid thing to say to try to win an argument.", ">Also, your husband's argument that feeding the child meat would be without their informed consent is nonsense because he's happy to force vegetarianism on him without his consent.\n\nThis was what I was gonna say.\n\nNTA but your husband is and he's reacting like a child", "plus its abuse to withhold food from a hungry child, especially one that doesnt understand any sort of reasoning besides \"I am hungry- thats what I want to eat!\"", "When my son was 3 or 4 yrs old, he articulated to me he doesn't like mushrooms and refuses to eat mushrooms.. While he was EATING mushrooms.. \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\n\nMy SO gave me that look that women give a guy that says \"stfu\" she had duxelled his mushrooms.. \ud83d\ude05", "Lol", "Fed is best", "[removed]", "That is correct\n\nEven a few years off meat can make some people grossly sick if they try again", "This is the answer.", "Yeah, there\u2019s a reason that so many European Pediatric health boards (Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France, Denmark, and Spain) explicitly caution against a vegan diet in young children, because it is impossible to meet adequate nutrition without supplementation and that can be dangerous for children.", "There\u2019s still a possibility of nutritional issues with an enforced vegetarian diet. It\u2019s not as likely as veganism to result in nutritional deficiencies, but it still can. It\u2019s not wise to restrict a young child\u2019s diet for any reason except actual allergy, particularly not when the kid hasn\u2019t been evaluated for being metabolically able to remain healthy on that diet.", "Then the OP really needs to see this and out her foot down", "You know, I\u2019ve spent years hearing that. \n\nI didn\u2019t eat pork for about 20 years due to health/digestion issues. I recently was able to change medication for an unrelated thing, and suddenly I can eat it again. \n\nPork is delicious.", "Thats wild to me lol. My friend went vegetarian at like 12 and was forced to eat meat when she was teaching in Korea for a year (not because of a lack of vegetarian options, but because of some social pressures). She was mostly able to handle poultry, but  said beef and pork were 1. Absolutely vile to her and 2. Made her violently sick (particularly pork). \n\nWhen we were kids she used to love steak and bacon.", "Bless your good fortune", "Yeah commonness varies and its a huge struggle to regain the ability\n\nI cant imagine someone raised vegetarian, if they could ever tolerate trying to convert"]}
