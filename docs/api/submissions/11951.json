I booked two, one for me and one for my best friend because her birthday is the same day and she loves the type of music, it was meant to be a surprise for her. I had told Joanne about this on one of her \"good days\" because I was genuinely excited to finally do something and live the college student lifestyle for a night. \n\nThe tickets were digital, on an account shared with my parents. Joanne had asked for the login telling them that she wanted to book tickets to something, but she was lying and used it to sell my tickets for drug money.

I checked and they were sent to someone I know Joanne knows. \n\nI went straight to her when she got home and asked what the fuck she did, and she tried lying but I showed her proof it went to someone she knows and told her I wanted my money back then and there. She told me it was gone already.

Your mom defending her is insane to me.", "I clicked on this post being so ready to call you an AH and tell you to mind your own business. However, You\u2019re NTA because your sister stole from you to buy drugs. Plenty of people have drug habits. Stealing from your family to support a drug a habit is another thing entirely. Protect whatever assets you have. Put passwords on all your devices and accounts that your sister won\u2019t be able to crack. Unless she truly apologizes and tries to get on a better track, she will probably try to pull something like this again either on you or someone else in your family.", "NTA.  Why are you apologizing?  I have no siblings, but seems that the only AH here is your sister and your mother.  What she did was theft.  She can pay you back or your mother can.

Happened to me A LOT growing up. \n\nMy advice is to have separate accounts from your family with stuff like this in the future and maybe also hide your cash / cards. She sounds desperate, and desperate drug addicts have the capacity to justify doing a lot of harm to people they care about just to get their next fix. \n\nShe needs help and it\u2019s disappointing your mom didn\u2019t see her stealing and selling your tickets for drug money as a sign that she needs help.", "NTA I would refrain from using any shared accounts that she can get the credentials to going forward.  \n\nSounds like a rough situation.

Don\u2019t apologize and guard your money and leave the house when you can afford to.", "NTA. AT ALL. You have nothing to apologize for. She made a plan to steal from you. And used your mother to do it. And your mother is ok with that? Where does your dad stand on this? Wtf? If one of my kids stole from the other I would sell their stuff to pay the other back.

Yes, addiction is a disease, but she isn't the only one suffering. You matter too. You deserve better. And if she doesn't quit now?
