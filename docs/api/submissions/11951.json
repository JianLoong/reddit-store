Protect whatever assets you have. Put passwords on all your devices and accounts that your sister won\u2019t be able to crack.

Why are you apologizing?  I have no siblings, but seems that the only AH here is your sister and your mother.  What she did was theft.  She can pay you back or your mother can.  All your mom is doing is teaching your sister that she can do whatever she wants and get away with it.", "so much NTA. your sister has a serious addiction problem. also, coke tends to turn people into narcissitic assholes. \nif she already stole from you, she will do it again. be cautious.", "NTA - Joanne doesn\u2019t have a cocaine habit.

Selling property that doesn't belong to you, is indeed a crime.", "/u/GigTicket10294 Op, This is the answer. Though I disagree with filing a police report, you do need to sit down with the parents. This isn't about the tickets this is about the life of the person who used to be your sister. You are in a dangerous situation.  Not physically, but emotionally and developmentally. You are living in a toxic environment. \n\nThere's nothing wrong, in my opinion, with occasionally doing cocaine. But when it starts to affect the lives of people around you especially through stealing that is serious problem that has developed. It is not part of the industry your sister is in, she just works with a group of people who frequently do cocaine, who by chance happen to work in restaurants. They may or may not be addicts themselves. Your sister has crossed the line. \n\n\nYou need to lock yourself away from her for your own good. Though you are 18 you are essentially still a child and still have a lot of developing to do. So controlling the situations affect on you will help this scar heal properly. You'll sit down with your parents and make your feelings known. And make it known that you're going to be locking yourself up from her until she gets help and until you see you improvement. From what it sound your parents will do nothing about this but it's important that it is made known. By doing nothing you are an enabler. You will not be an enabler, though your parents will continue to be. \n\nI've known many many people who live their lives this way. I am not exaggerating as I make these following statements. This is excluding alcohol. Most people who have crossed the line into addiction in my own life have died of overdoses. A couple have gone to jail for armed robbery. Side note I recently saw one of those guys who was a close friend of mine at the grocery store. He was with his mother and looked 30 years older than me though he is 5 years younger. One suicide after being sentence to prison for killing a woman while driving high on pills. Most recently, the last one to fall was a couple years ago. He was murdered in his own basement. Struggle with drugs his whole life. He'd come and go, be clean or lost again. A detail about this man you might find interesting is he was a brilliant chef. \n\nI hung out with a strange crew for a man who didn't really do drugs but on the rarest of occasions years apart. But I know how all those stories end... I've taken a final pause for a couple minutes while writing this to think of there's anyone I know who has stolen for drugs who has survived, unscathed. I sincerely cannot think of anybody. So I'll just say maybe I don't know that some of them have stolen. \n\nThese were all good people with good hearts. They just got sick. It sounds like a cliche but it's not. I knew them. They were good kind people. \n\nNow here you are in a situation I've seen so many times. Offer the help you can, but protect yourself. Don't let anything be taken from you.", "Also important to get a new bank account *at a different bank.*", "I honestly can't believe that the mom has basically enabled OP's sister to become the person that she is.", "I bet OPs mum is the kind of person to cry and claim she \"didn't see it coming\" if something happened to the eldest.", "Others have probably mentioned this, but - as someone who had to deal with this with my own loved ones - you should really look into a credit freeze. \n\nIt's absolutely free, it will not affect your credit score, and it will make it significantly more challenging for anyone to open a line of credit in your name. Signing up to the credit bureaus with your own email address and contact info should also help keep you in the loop should anyone try to unfreeze your credit. \n\nAll it really takes these days to open a line of credit in someone else's name is knowledge. If she knows your social, birthday, address, etc - and she's desperate - sooner or later she'll justify it to herself. \n\nTaking the time to make that as difficult as possible will save you a *lot* of money and stress. Makes it harder for anyone *else* to steal your identity, too.", "You sister is becoming a severe drug addict and your parents are in complete denial. She is already stealing, next they usually start selling jewelry that your parents think is in their possession and robbing grandmas. You sis knew exactly what she was doing, she has a dependency now and doesn't care who she hurts.

Wtf.", "\\^\\^ THIS RIGHT HERE. u/Content_Row_3716 hit the nail on the head. I'm sure you love your mom, but she's definitely not helping the situation with your sister at ALL. Both of them can pound salt with papercuts. Buy yourself a safe, if you can. They're pretty cheap on amazon (mini ones anyway), and keep EVERYTHING of value. Report the tickets to her \"friend\" as stolen property. Even if the police don't do anything \"outright\", at least make a report with them, so when said friend goes to use the tickets, they're already flagged.\n\nYour sister has a problem, it doesn't matter if she minds her own. But she clearly doesn't, because she's stealing from family for her booger sugar habit. It's fine if it's your own, etc. whatever. I don't discriminate against addiction. Nobody should, either. Now I say this because as long as you can manage your own shit, you're fine. But she's coming down the line of starting to steal from her own siblings. It only gets worse from here if family continues to enable her, simply because she pays rent on time and keeps to herself.  This isn't a \"rail off a stripper's ass\" bucket list shit, this is a habit she's starting to jeproadize relationships over. Not good.\n\nEventually, she won't. She'll be so far down the Scarface rabbit hole, that she will lose herself if she's allowed to continue. She will fuel that habit by any means neccessary. Including continued theft, losing her job, and worst case, prostitution. She needs help. But not from you, OP. She's gotta pick it for herself, and nobody's gonna convince her otherwise.  She isn't sick and tired of being sick and tired, and this is just the beginning.\n\nSource: Was a detox medic for county jail some years ago...and I've watched people go from getting busted with a dime bag of coke going to rehab via courts to \"fix\" the problem, to watching them full on decline.
