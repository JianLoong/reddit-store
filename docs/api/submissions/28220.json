You need to find a job and get out of the house. Don't be picky, take any job and get some experience.", "You're NTA for not wanting to babysit any more, but you should think carefully about what you want to happen. You're an adult now, which means your parents would be within their rights to ask you to pay rent and contribute to bills in exchange for living at home. It sounds like they see you babysitting as your contribution to the household, so if you pull back from it they might expect you to contribute in other ways (or, move out).", "NAH. It was more of an issue when you were 16 and in school, but now you\u2019ve graduated and aren\u2019t pursuing any higher education or working so presumably they\u2019re paying for everything for you. So it\u2019s a reasonable trade off to expect you to provide some child care in return. Once you find a job you can either look to move out or offer to pay for your things and maybe a little rent instead of babysitting.", "NAH. You are living with them for free. You can provide childcare until you get a job and your own place. But look into childcare centers if you like kids. You already have some experience. Otherwise, you need to see what resources are available to get a skilled job that doesn't involve UNI.", "NTA your parents are parentafying you. \n\nKeep looking for work, include fast food places, grocery stores, and many hotels are looking for housekeepers and front desk staff. Take any job that comes your way, because it's easier to find a job, when you have a job, seeing you are employable is better than thinking you are employable. \n\nWhen you do find work, make sure you have a bank account that they can't access. Don't give your parents your exact schedule, it will give you the ability to spend time with your friends, and they won't be able to plan all of your off time. \n\nSave up a few months worth of money, if you can, and find a shared accommodation.\n\nIt won't be easy, but it will be worth it.", "Get out as soon as possible or you will be the full time care giver for a 2 yo and an infant.  that sounds like hell.", "NTA but move out ASAP", "NTA. You are being used, especially when you were not an \"adult\" and still in school. They asked too much of you. Now that you're not in school and not working, it's trickier. Babysitting may be what they consider your rent. \n\nI would take literally any job and then tell your parents when you'll be working and unavailable for babysitting. And maybe try to work out when you *will* babysit so yo can also get some downtime. Then you can hopefully save up and get out.\n\nOr do you have other friends/family you can live with?", "NTA - You not unemployed, your job is going to school.  You're just between semesters.  Do they expect you to drop your studies to take care of these two rug rats when that time comes?  Hell no.  I have a son in senior year of college.  We always check with him for these type of things and would never interrupt his schooling or studying for us.  If he says he can't because of school, that's it for us and we respect that.  Your parents are being selfish with your time and you need to lay down a firm boundary with them with school for you.", "NAH.\n\nYou're an adult, you have no job and you are no longer in school of your own volition. Yes, you should expect to have to contribute to the household. Moreso than if you had a job.\n\nIf you believe that your parents are overworking you and it's getting in the way of finding and keeping a job, then by all means have a discussion about how many childcare hours and which household tasks you should be responsible for.\n\nIf your parents believe you owe them an open-ended amount of whatever they want due to your current nonworking, non-student status, think hard about whether it's worthwhile to push back. You have no job. Even if you have a savings, you have no income. Moving out due to feeling poorly used may not be a valid option at this time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
