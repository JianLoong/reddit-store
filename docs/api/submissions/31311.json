The only mistake, which is understandable, is discussing this with the aunt.  It was purely an intimidation technique.  I'm pretty sure the student will try this again.

If she could buy a condo last week they can still do that in the time available and, maybe try negotiating for extra time to close the sale after they make an offer if needed rather than trying to guilt or bully you into letting her stay.
