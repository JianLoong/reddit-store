It's hard to criticize your parents and even proving them they did something wrong, might not have the desired response. In most of their opinions, since you did well in life, have a nice and happy family, a good job etc, they seem to believe they did an awesome job at raising you. \n\nYes, times were different back then and lots of \"small things\" have caused a lot of harm for us adults now. You and your siblings being able to rationalize what happened to you is the first step towards healing and braking the habbit. \n\nWhat you are asking from your father, to own up to his mistakes, I'm not sure is possible, at least not without professional help. He has his own trauma to battle and he most likely won't be up to go through this painful process since it usually involves already deceased family members which makes brining up their memory in negative ways, even more dreadful. \n\nWhat you could do maybe is set boundaries for him. It all depends on how much you're ok with him to have a right to bring up stuff he thinks might be improved or might be a negative influence in whatever way. If it triggers you hearing his criticizm, then maybe you need to tell him to not bring it up and ultimately he has to understand that he has to respect your decisions as a parent regarding your kids.\n\nIf you did indeed came to terms with his parenting style and understand that he did not hurt you or your siblings intentionally, you need to forgive him. You can do this regarding he realizes what he did was wrong, though I have the feeling he knows it and given the chance he would certainly do some things differently. You can have a heart to heart talk with him and assure him you did not mean to offend him, you are grateful for him to be your dad, but wishing for some things to have been different is not a sin either and he should understand that every kid is different and you know your kids best and what they need.", "NTA.  But have a talk with your dad.  Put any pent up emotions about the past to the side and talk with him.  I can not imagine the pain your father is feeling right now.  Yes, he was a harsher parent than you.  I\u2019m sure your father was ALOT nicer and loving of a parent towards you than his father was.  What was said in the heat of the moment will stick with that man for the rest of his life.  It sounds like it has impacted him already.  \nPlease coming from someone who just lost his father last year my dad was only 68, due to the dementia I technically lost my father when he was 62.  Your dad can\u2019t be that big of an asshole if he is still a part of your life and your children\u2019s life.\n\nYour father is correct, the up bringing of children by the generations before us have been harsher.   It what your father did and what you are doing is the same thing.  Your father WAS a kinder, more emotional there parent than his were.  I can almost guarantee that your father thought of how his parents were towards him as a child growing up and he learned from the mistakes they made and tried, TRIED not to make the same mistakes with you.\nYOU are doing the same thing.

Referring to your kids in the generic such as \"boy\" and \"girl\" creates an emotional barrier between you and them, and strips them of their unique identity. Identity is relative. Who someone is in relation to their parent is different than who that person is in relation to a friend, spouce, boss, coworker, etc. While everyone else in their lives is treating them as a unique individual by calling them by their name, nick name, or loving pet name, you're treating them as just another boy/girl. Nothing special. \n\n2. Referring to them as boy/girl cements the notion of gender, gender roles, and gender stereotypes in their developing brains. As they age, and their thoughts come into conflict with these roles and stereotypes, they're likely going to experience an unhealthy amount of angst, anxiety, and existential crises. All of which could have been avoided. \n\n3. Using your children as props in an argument dehumanizes them.\n\n4. The Simpsons aims to represent Homer's failures as a father.

Maybe it's what they're used to growing up and they think of it as a special inside joke with their dad that they love, and they'll want him calling them boy/girl even when they're 50 with kids of their own.

As far as OP knows, his kids are fine with him treating them like they're cartoon characters and that's okay.

My dad is silent generation and I think I've only heard him say \"I love you\" maybe 2 or 3 times in his life and we only hug on holidays, but that man shows his love in so many other ways, especially in acts of service, and he's also emotionally intelligent in that I never once felt judged by him or that I had to change. He let me keep my Christmas tree up in the livingroom until July one year because he agreed it was pretty. I'm AuDHD and he's part of the reason I made it into adulthood without self-esteem issues from childhood. But he is also gruff and doesn't mince his words.

Just by reading the entire thing, without skimming and even rereading just to make sure, it\u2019s clear that the father is hounding him about a lot of his parenting style, but the main issue for father is the name. Everything that OP said is what his father did to them. You seem like you\u2019ve experienced the struggles, but you were too young to understand at the time, but some people are just too ignorant and won\u2019t see their flaws, unless it\u2019s TERRIBLY and UGILY shoved in their face.

Just what he said about his parenting and excused it with \u201cit was a different time\u201d you usually hear racists and wife beaters talk like that, so it\u2019s clearly a bad sign. His father couldn\u2019t stop badgering him about his parenting, so he did the only thing that could truly get his dad to see; humiliation, self reflection, mirroring, emphasis. I know it\u2019s hard to excuse this behavior, and I\u2019m not excusing it too. If there really was another way to talk to his dad, I bet OP would\u2019ve taken it, but some people, especially ignorant people, can\u2019t be talked to like an adult, you can\u2019t have an honest or decent conversation with them especially if it\u2019s about their flaws.
