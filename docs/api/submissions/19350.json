It's hard to criticize your parents and even proving them they did something wrong, might not have the desired response. In most of their opinions, since you did well in life, have a nice and happy family, a good job etc, they seem to believe they did an awesome job at raising you. \n\nYes, times were different back then and lots of \"small things\" have caused a lot of harm for us adults now. You and your siblings being able to rationalize what happened to you is the first step towards healing and braking the habbit. \n\nWhat you are asking from your father, to own up to his mistakes, I'm not sure is possible, at least not without professional help. He has his own trauma to battle and he most likely won't be up to go through this painful process since it usually involves already deceased family members which makes brining up their memory in negative ways, even more dreadful. \n\nWhat you could do maybe is set boundaries for him. It all depends on how much you're ok with him to have a right to bring up stuff he thinks might be improved or might be a negative influence in whatever way. If it triggers you hearing his criticizm, then maybe you need to tell him to not bring it up and ultimately he has to understand that he has to respect your decisions as a parent regarding your kids.\n\nIf you did indeed came to terms with his parenting style and understand that he did not hurt you or your siblings intentionally, you need to forgive him. You can do this regarding he realizes what he did was wrong, though I have the feeling he knows it and given the chance he would certainly do some things differently. You can have a heart to heart talk with him and assure him you did not mean to offend him, you are grateful for him to be your dad, but wishing for some things to have been different is not a sin either and he should understand that every kid is different and you know your kids best and what they need.", "NTA.  But have a talk with your dad.  Put any pent up emotions about the past to the side and talk with him.  I can not imagine the pain your father is feeling right now.  Yes, he was a harsher parent than you.  I\u2019m sure your father was ALOT nicer and loving of a parent towards you than his father was.  What was said in the heat of the moment will stick with that man for the rest of his life.  It sounds like it has impacted him already.  \nPlease coming from someone who just lost his father last year my dad was only 68, due to the dementia I technically lost my father when he was 62.  Your dad can\u2019t be that big of an asshole if he is still a part of your life and your children\u2019s life.\n\nYour father is correct, the up bringing of children by the generations before us have been harsher.   It what your father did and what you are doing is the same thing.  Your father WAS a kinder, more emotional there parent than his were.  I can almost guarantee that your father thought of how his parents were towards him as a child growing up and he learned from the mistakes they made and tried, TRIED not to make the same mistakes with you.\nYOU are doing the same thing.
