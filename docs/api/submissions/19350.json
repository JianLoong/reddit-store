Where you might be in dicey territory is the parenting choice of using your children as props, and threatening, even in jest, to withhold affection. It sounds like you have a healthy parental bond, and your kids are old enough and know you weren\u2019t serious. But if they had any ambiguity about that, then you\u2019d be an AH for causing it just to illustrate a point to your father.", ">I said in return they would have to call me Sir not daddy or dad. I said I would accept Father in emotional conversations. But that I would no longer remind them every day that I loved them and was proud of them.\n\n\n\nNTA for saying that as like a message to your dad. But I hope you have a private conversation where you let them know that if they ever do seriously want you to call them by their names, you would of course do it and not make them change how they address you or love them less. I\u2019m sure they probably already know, but I think it\u2019s worth covering your bases and make sure they know you said that as a joke to your dad, not as an actual rule you\u2019d follow.", "You're NTA. \n\n>Now he is being pissy and my mom says he is upset that I think he was a bad father.\n\nBull. He's upset he can't control how you interact with your kids.\n\n>He said it was a different time.\n\nMore bull, unless you started your family rather late and you're at least in your mid-60's.\n\n>That his father was worse than him.\n\nSo each generation is getting better at parenting.", "NTA!!\n\nIf you dish out....\n\nWhy does it bother him so much, how does it hurt the children? I don't see how this could even remotely hurt them.\n\nBut yeah sure, run away as soon as you get the mirror held to your face and be pissed about it.\n\nSounds sooo much like my Dad! We know they mean well but still no.", "Maybe don\u2019t put your kids in an awkward spot to make a point.", "NTA, but be sure to tell your kids that if they end up not liking the nicknames anymore, that that's totally fine!", "ESH. The whole comment about you calling them by their names means they have to call you Sir Instead of Dad\u2026. Sorry but no. If your kids are generally happy with what you call them then fine, but to expect to be called sir? Hell no. You are their dad, they can call you dad. \n\nYou dad sounds like an arse no matter what.", "NTA. It's hard to criticize your parents and even proving them they did something wrong, might not have the desired response. In most of their opinions, since you did well in life, have a nice and happy family, a good job etc, they seem to believe they did an awesome job at raising you. \n\nYes, times were different back then and lots of \"small things\" have caused a lot of harm for us adults now. You and your siblings being able to rationalize what happened to you is the first step towards healing and braking the habbit. \n\nWhat you are asking from your father, to own up to his mistakes, I'm not sure is possible, at least not without professional help. He has his own trauma to battle and he most likely won't be up to go through this painful process since it usually involves already deceased family members which makes brining up their memory in negative ways, even more dreadful. \n\nWhat you could do maybe is set boundaries for him. It all depends on how much you're ok with him to have a right to bring up stuff he thinks might be improved or might be a negative influence in whatever way. If it triggers you hearing his criticizm, then maybe you need to tell him to not bring it up and ultimately he has to understand that he has to respect your decisions as a parent regarding your kids.\n\nIf you did indeed came to terms with his parenting style and understand that he did not hurt you or your siblings intentionally, you need to forgive him. You can do this regarding he realizes what he did was wrong, though I have the feeling he knows it and given the chance he would certainly do some things differently. You can have a heart to heart talk with him and assure him you did not mean to offend him, you are grateful for him to be your dad, but wishing for some things to have been different is not a sin either and he should understand that every kid is different and you know your kids best and what they need.", "NTA.  But have a talk with your dad.  Put any pent up emotions about the past to the side and talk with him.  I can not imagine the pain your father is feeling right now.  Yes, he was a harsher parent than you.  I\u2019m sure your father was ALOT nicer and loving of a parent towards you than his father was.  What was said in the heat of the moment will stick with that man for the rest of his life.  It sounds like it has impacted him already.  \nPlease coming from someone who just lost his father last year my dad was only 68, due to the dementia I technically lost my father when he was 62.  Your dad can\u2019t be that big of an asshole if he is still a part of your life and your children\u2019s life.\n\nYour father is correct, the up bringing of children by the generations before us have been harsher.   It what your father did and what you are doing is the same thing.  Your father WAS a kinder, more emotional there parent than his were.  I can almost guarantee that your father thought of how his parents were towards him as a child growing up and he learned from the mistakes they made and tried, TRIED not to make the same mistakes with you.\nYOU are doing the same thing.  We as parents should want to make their childhood better than what we had growing up.", "YTA.\n\nIt is possible to think it\u2019s a mistake to be calling them boy/girl without being a hypocrite.\n\nYour problem is with your childhood not this thing.", "NTA - It was a different time. It sure was. And so many kids from that time feel just as you do. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My girls are 26, one is in the Navy, one son is 24 in the Army and other son is 9, no military affiliation yet, lol.  I dont call my daughters \"girl\" but call both sons \"boy\".  Also, all 4 kids are open with affection and we hug and kiss \"hello/goodby\" in public or whatever.  \n\nI feel you on the emotionally distant thing with dad.  It was on my list of things I DIDNT want to pass on to my children.  So I ALWAYS tell them how proud I am of them, I ALWAYS show them love and attention they deserve as my children.\n\nSure your dad feels guilty, he knows certain things he could have done better but that was the past.

It would have been far more impactful and meaningful if you had asked them if they liked their nicknames or wou prefer their actual names, with no threat of consequence. You still don't ACTUALLY know if they like their nicknames, you only proved that they like calling you dad and hearing words of affection more than they hate their nicknames.\n\nNTA for calling your dad out for his bullshit and everything about that, but kinda Y T A for telling your kids (and your dad) that your love is conditional on getting to call them Boy and Girl instead of their names.\n\nPs, I don't think that your kids have a problem with it, my issue is that you don't actually know.", "Exactly, in that moment you were as bad as your father."]}
