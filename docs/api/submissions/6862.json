Pretty much, unless you are not planning on staying with him, you will be a blended family, and that means shared everything. \n\nMaybe not be so upfront if it worries you.

Isn\u2019t it supposed to be like up to 25% for the first kid?", "I agree with your sentiment 100%. When my husband and I were dating- when we had separate finances- when he was low in the bank or had overdrawn his account, I\u2019d send him money to help him out so that he didn\u2019t struggle financially because we were both paying an equal share of bills, and sometimes between buying household expenses, it would deplete one of our accounts, so we always helped each other as a team.\n\nAfter this happened for a little while, we ended up coming together and decided to combine finances because we were both good with budgeting and felt it would be better to share the account since we were sending each other funds anyway, and it worked out very well. After this, I\u2019m the one who handled paying all bills to make things easier since I like to pay everything at once to ensure everything gets paid on time.\n\nSo combining finances is not recommended unless your financial situation logically calls for it and as long as you and your partner view each other equally because not sharing finances can really put a divide between a couple- sharing them can also cause issues if one partner is untrustworthy or can\u2019t manage their money well, so if you combine bank accounts and aren\u2019t sure about your partner\u2019s financial situation, it\u2019s best to know about their spending habits before you commit to this agreement. \n\nSometimes people make the mistake of combining their accounts too early on in the relationship and they trap themselves into financial issues because they didn\u2019t know their partner was going to end up draining their finances due to bad spending habits or other reasons, and if the relationship ends, then you\u2019re stuck having to go and divide your finances again just to get out of it. So until you know your relationship will be a long term thing and you\u2019re both in it for the long haul, I don\u2019t recommend it unless this is for sure something you want.\n\nFor OP, combining finances would be a truly bad idea because if her partner is only paying a 25% share of their household expenses/bills, her money would even go toward his child support, and if he were to stop paying it at some point and the state decided to garnish his wages, this would freeze their bank account and would cause issues with her being able to even access her money.\n\nWith that said, they really need to come together to find an equal solution to their bills because I\u2019m betting her boyfriend has a lot more money aside from what he\u2019s paying in child support and she\u2019s the one carrying the biggest financial weight in their relationship, so she\u2019s definitely getting screwed with this. I can imagine the boyfriend probably isn\u2019t even open about what all he spends his money on because he may not want OP to know the full range of what his financial situation is truly like.", "I agree.\n\nIt comes across as he is mooching off her big time.\n\nBut she has issues she refused to admit re his daughter.", "I have two questions: if OP and her BF have equal salaries as she states, why is this something OP needs to pay for and not the BF?

I know I pay the bills on time and have never had a late payment or any derogatory marks on my credit. So I feel safer having separate finances.", "Op will never be blood related to his daughter. It doesn't matter if her kids will be blood related. That's totally irrelevant. Her only responsibility is her own child unless she chooses different. She shouldn't be shamed if she chooses not to take on the responsibility of someone else's child. That's his kid and his responsibility.", "This is not true.\n\nMy husband always treated my children as his own when we were dating, but I made sure that I covered my children\u2019s major expenses prior to combining finances because this would not have been fair to him to have paid for my children when we weren\u2019t married yet. If you\u2019re not their stepparent, you\u2019re not liable for the needs of the child. The parent is 100% responsible for them, and if you have a partner who is also in agreement on footing the bill for these expenses, that\u2019s great, but the parent should always know that they are always responsible for this financially and shouldn\u2019t fully depend on the partner because if the relationship ends at some point, this can put them in an even bigger predicament because they relied on someone else who they weren\u2019t with long term to help them with supporting their children, and they would essentially lose that extra income.", "Does this guy even have a job?", "Please do not marry this guy. Get rid of him. I know, reddit jumps to breaking up quickly, but he does not deserve you. You're better off alone, and so is your future child. If you continue to put up with his BS...
