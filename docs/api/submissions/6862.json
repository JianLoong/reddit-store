Of course it's not my business, but I've been in her shoes before (he has other children with another ex), and because I didn't set boundaries, he let me do as I please without ever offering to pick up the tab. \n\nYou have to draw the line somewhere, and it's time to do that now.", "i'm gonna hit it with a Not enough info.   \n\n\n\\- > You have separate finances, but do you plan on marrying?  \n\n\nis the 8 yr old in your life often?   \n\n\n\\-> if so, YTA, you should split finances, you'd be the step mom to that little girl, it's not her fault her dad couldn't keep with her mom.   \n\n\n\\-> If not planning on marriage/living together until both kids are grown? Break it off now before you cause more emotional damage to an 8 year old.   \n\n\nThink of the kid(s) One is a baby, won't recall most trips in the first two years of it's life, but the little girl will. she's 8, not like she has a perfect life, and you mentioned child support so i'm thinking split custody between he and his baby momma?", "You\u2019re getting very screwed over with this agreement. I knew there had to be an issue financially that would have you even consider this.\n\nShe\u2019s definitely a part of your family because she\u2019s a part of him, but this is also extremely unfair to you to have to cover the majority of everything.", "U sure he is not using you for your money? Why do you pay 75 of everything just because he pays child support and on top of that you have to pay for her? Something here is really fishy", "Wtf kind of dynamic are y\u2019all bringing a child into", "You earn the same salaries but you have agreed to pay 75% of the bills? Why would you agree to this?", "This is such a weird construction. And this case proves why. Now every financial discussion is sensitive.\n\nI think you should seek advice in this.", "Apparently that\u2019s just not enough for some of these Redditors. Not the house you bought either. They\u2019ve got super high expectations of you regarding your bf\u2019s daughter.", "Wait, wait, wait\u2026\n\nWHAT?!?\n\nAre you saying he has washed his hands of responsibility of the child you are carrying to which he donated DNA?", "So if I\u2019m understanding this right. You are carrying his child but he doesn\u2019t plan on helping beside buying diapers and you are ok with that? So my same question do you plan on marrying him knowing all this? And I saw you say because he isn\u2019t going to do much is why you feel this way my next question is why are you a relationship with him?", "I just deleted it. I do not have the brain power for this post. Thank you for pointing out my mistake.", "Crap. I apparently was not paying attention. Thank you! I will update it and quit looking at these tonight.", ">Edited to add: I bought a home for he and his daughter to live in. She has now had two extremely nice birthdays & christmases since I\u2019ve been in the picture. I pay 75% of bills & cook her dinner every night she\u2019s over (which she doesn\u2019t even have at her mothers). So I have provided a very nice life for her.\n\nThis is why people questioned this case. She's bragging about buying a home and having fancy parties for his daughter...but somehow going on the family vacation is just too much?? What?", "He was supposed to be paying down his debt (which he hasn\u2019t). And pays child support so he has more bills than me I should be affording it. And because the house is in my name not his.

I\u2019m responsible for the rest. So this also plays a major factor in my stance.", "He wants to get married. I do not until he can get his finances under control or carry his weight.", "Depends on the vacation. Could also be a line in the sand type of deal?", "OP bought a home that they all live in. She\u2019s given the daughter 2 nice birthdays and Christmas\u2019, pays 75% of the bills, buys all her school clothes, and cooks for the child. That\u2019s not enough for someone who isn\u2019t a step parent yet? Dang.

She shouldn't be playing mother figure yet.", "Yes, that's exactly what happened when I first got with my kids' dad. I became the step mom to his other children within the first 6 months of our relationship. I took over doing all of the cooking, cleaning, kid supervision, bought them new clothes (that finally fit them! He never bought them clothes for his house so all of their pants were about 2 sizes too small), spoiled them for holidays and birthdays, I even cashed out my 401k the very first Christmas (because he convinced me that $16k wasn't that much and we could use the money), and took us all on a spring vacation and paid for the townhouse myself.\n\n Fast forward to now and his gf moved in with him over the last summer. Sold her (very nice) house and moved into his house which has been in the process of getting \"fixed up\" for nearly 20 years (but it's paid off) (I'm estimating there was a $30k profit from the sale of her house). Since then, his house is suddenly fixed up on the outside (a project we started together 10 years ago with our tax return), the kids have all new things, new furniture, always a new toy, etc. And she works from home, so built in child care. \n\nI love that she takes care of them, but I can see what's going on. I would love to tell her all this, but it wouldn't go over well, so I just try to make her life a little easier and thank her when I can.\n\nDefinitely talk to him now before too much resentment is built up.", "\ud83e\udd2f", "WHY are you with this guy?", "So\u2026. Like\u2026 why do you want to be with this guy? He sounds like a real piece of work.", "You're smart for that.", "But she is.... Her edit is about her bragging how she provided for his daughter more than her bio Mom does.... But she's not good enough for the family vacation....", "I will be doing so. Crazy how similar our situations sound. I also work from home which makes him think built in child care but I have meetings to be on and such.", "Just seeing the edit, thanks.", "NTA. Why are you supporting this guy?", "NTA The fact that he, rightly, has to pay child support should have zero effect on how you spilt the bills. His income and outgoings are his alone. You are financing his lifestyle. This is not an equal partnership. He should be living within his means as if you weren't in the picture. That includes paying for his own vacation and that of his own child.", "NTA\n\nAlso, I suggest you contact a lawyer just to make sure you'll be fine in case you separate. States have different terms for what can be considered a domestic partnership, or even if he can make a claim on your house bc he's paying part of the mortgage. Just make sure you'll be financially safe if things ever go south. \n\nAnd just to underscore what many others have said: that man is a total freeloader.", "Why isn't he paying HIS way on the vacation?", "NTA, given the context that you two are supposedly splitting finances, and are equally well off, it already doesn't make sense that you're paying for 75% of the bills and are her primary parent.\n\nI really think you should question why he is deciding that the trip should be three times the cost when you are paying for it. Why does he want you to spend so much money for his enjoyment? Why are you the primary parent to his child both financially and timewise?", "NTA. And the split you have now is entirely unfair. Why are you playing 75% of household expenses and 100% of expenses for your shared child? When you make the same salary??? This man is a leech.", "If you want to have a family vacation and consider his daughter family then why not split the cost with him? While it\u2019s not your responsibility it does sound like the right thing to do, in my opinion. Hopefully you guys have these conversations when his daughter is at her moms house, kids hear a lot more than adults realize and you don\u2019t want to make her feel unwanted.", "He's using you as a cash cow. Nta and stop paying so much of everything, it should be equally split.", "NTA\n\nVacation is not a necessity so if he wants his child to go then he should come up with the money.", "Y T A to yourself for letting this man milk you for money.

OP, I have read through all your comments and you seem like an intelligent, knowledgeable and well informed person. I humbly submit to you that you have been taken in by a man who is not only selfish but also a very good user and manipulator. He is and will always look for a partner who will be a mother to him and take care of all his responsibilities. It won\u2019t matter the amount of counseling or begging, bitching, and pleading you do he is of the variety of man that doesn\u2019t believe he should take responsibility for his own life. These types of men actively seek out independent women who are financially and emotionally responsible so that they can continue to be stuck in an adolescent state of mind. The man wants to take no responsibility for either of his children or their care. I beseech you to really take heed to all the warning signs and red flags this man is throwing off and run like the hounds of hell are licking at your feet. As we often say on Reddit, he has shown you who he really is, so believe him. Please don\u2019t waste another year or another dime on this man. You deserve so much better!\n\nSource: 23 years with a man very much like this. You will never understand how good freedom will feel until you get away from him."]}
