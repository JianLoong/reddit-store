How is he going to get prescriptions, check the mail, walk a dog or drop kids off at school etc?? \n\nHaving a partner that helps out when they can or when you. can't is a big deal.\n\nI would really re evaluate your situation. Hope you feel better soon!!!", "[removed]", "NTA and you should run. This is a one side relationship.", "NTA. Was it your plan to have a child this early in life? Imagine how much you could do with all the time you spend caring for this child.", "\"Don't ask me to do things I don't want to do!!\" - My four year old, earlier today when I asked him to put his shoes on.  \n\nIf you are a human who eats food and is not contagious (thanks covid!) Then you either need to be able to grocery shop and cook or pay for someone to do it for you.  \n\nLadies - please stop moving in with dudes who cannot function without a mommy taking care of them.  Please!  I am now at the point where I say never move in with a man that hasn't lived on his own an survived the process.  Honestly it is probably super good for everyone to live on their own in their early 20's - our economy is just not being helpful with that.", "Ordered in, click and collect, straight to the car, uber groceries.
