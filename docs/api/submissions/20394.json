My sole point was that your suggestion will do nothing to resolve the issue he's facing.", "that was my thought. it's fine over dinner or 'going shopping?' but when intimate? eeek", ">She should not even be asked to compromise on this. \n\nSounds good. As soon as he realized it made him uncomfortable he should have left in the night. God forbid *talking* to your partner or expressing your feelings.\n\nLook, I am not saying she *should* compromise. You are right, it his HER NAME!\u2122 and at the end of the day she needs to be comfortable with it.\n\nBut I also think people should get off the BFs ass for being uncomfortable. People are jumping really quick to \"this guy is a controlling AH and you should break up\". \n\nIt is OK for the OP to not be willing to let her BF use a nickname. It is *also* OK for the BF to be uncomfortable with calling his GF the same name as his mother. If they are going to stay together *one* of them is going to have to be a bit uncomfortable for a while.", "I\u2019d say your name is in many cases a bigger part of your identity than your job or hair. You switch jobs and hairstyles at least a few times in your life, most people have a much more permanent relationship with their name (obviously people change that too but not as nearly as frequently within a lifetime)", "I agree. Nobody should *have* to compromise about their name. The critical element here is choice. \n\n>not things that are intrinsic to who you are\n\nDifferent people represent themselves in different ways. For some people clothing is an intrinsic representation of their identity. Other people feel super strongly about how they decorate their room.\n\nNot everyone considered their name to be a divine manifestation of their sacred inner self. For a lot of people a nickname is no big deal.\n\nWe cannot look inside the OP's head. We cannot evaluate how much of a deal it would be for her to let her BF use a nickname. This is why only the OP can make the decision.", "He's not trying to give her a pet name, he's trying to give her a nickname. Like she wants to be called Elizabeth, but he's calling her Lizzy because his mom is Elizabeth. A pet name like babe or honey would be different.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s given her a pet name, he\u2019s using a different name in place of hers.", "As other people have said there is a difference between pet names and nicknames. I don't mind my hubby calling me babe or hun in everyday conversation, but if he tried completely changing my name and calling me Linda, I wouldn't be OK with that.", "Ooo definitely it should be kept to Babe or a pet name at that time.  That could be a good compromise.", "I just don't moan names during sex. I have a handful of times and it just feels like clunky", "If such a miniscule thing is worth breaking up over then it wasn't much of a relationship in the first place.", "But like, he's the one who knew about this potential issue and decided to date her anyway. They are 5 months in, he should have either said something at the beginning, or figured it out by now!", "We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree, then, because I think even asking her to compromise on her NAME is disgusting and shows she\u2019s not mature, empathetic or respectful enough to be in a relationship. As for \u201cif they\u2019re going to stay together ONE of them is going to have to be uncomfortable,\u201d yes, ONE will, and it should be the controlling, demanding, immature AH, not the one who just wants the incredibly baseline respect of being called by *her own name.*", "So rather than get over this minor hangup you would suggest the guy \"leave in the night\"? Lmao?", "Ya OK, have a nice adult conversation about the issue.\n\n\nUntil he calls her \"inconsiderate\" for not meekly submitting to his renaming of her. That name-calling behavior, an effort to get his way, makes him controlling.\n\n\nBig ick.", "OP literally said she doesn't want the nickname and the BF is pushing and calling her names because of it.", "Exactly. When my husband says my actual name I know it's serious. We normally call each other \"sweetie\" \"babe\" etc. Besides, doesn't OP's boyfriend call his mother \"Mom\" or \"Mum\" or whatever?", "That was sarcasm."]}
