He's in wrong; he needs to be doing his part as a parent and around the house. Having kids is hard and it's not the damn 50's anymore. Great that he provides for the family! Still, he's still got to step up and help you with the house and actually be a dad. I love video games and I can get a little too addicted from time to time but the kids come first. It's a bad mentality to have that he provides the money and therefore has no responsibility at home. Too many men (I'm one) still get caught in the \"women's responsibilities\" mindset when it comes to midnight wakings, household chores, and being a present, engaged father. If the tables were turned and you were the breadwinner, I can guarantee that he'd be upset if you did what he's doing.\n\nIf you haven't talked to him about it, then perhaps the \"suck each other off\" comment was overkill. I'm unfortunately in a rough marriage bc my wife is really verbally and emotionally abusive, so hurtful words do hit and cut. However, it's hard to say YAH when he's allowed you to be the only parent and housekeeper while still telling you that YOU ruined HIS life. He needs to grow up. I really can't fault you for what you said in this instance bc you're exhausted and you don't seem to have any help from your partner. Making enough money to support a family in one income is a really amazing thing, especially in today's times. He can and should be proud of that. But - again - TODAY'S times. It's not enough. You need his help and he should be there for you emotionally and physically instead of only financially.\n\nNTA.", "What gets me is that kids are kids for such a short time!

I was very lucky in that my partnet wanted to spend as much time as possible with them so we were a tight family unit (still are) but op's husband is dipping out on so much while he plays with his friends.

Leave him the kids, a list of everything you do in a day, and tell him you expect a home-cooked, nourishing meal when you get home.
