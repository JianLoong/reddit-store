My husband and I had to move a 24 hour drive away from our families, who all live in the same area. His family lives about 2 hours from mine. He, as a result, does not have many friends or family nearby. He\u2019s been struggling to make friends over these past two years and it\u2019s been pretty hard on him (and me too, honestly) but never has he thrown that in my face like that. We\u2019re a team, and we\u2019re both on the same page about that. I know my situation is different in that I don\u2019t have the mobility to move back \u201chome\u201d, but I think for you the issue is that he\u2019s throwing this all in your face and blaming you while also looking (without your input) for a place to live. That\u2019s super disrespectful. This should be a conversation.\n\nINFO: has he tried to discuss this in the past, or is this out of the blue?", "NTA, but I would put together a plan to leave this guy. He sounds pretty useless. Another commenter said that this is a bad example of a relationship for your kids to grow up around - they\u2019re right. Likely your husband thinks this is a-ok behaviour because it\u2019s what his household looks like. Also, I don\u2019t think moving to his hometown sounds like a healthy decision. You were right to be pissed - use that energy towards getting yourself out of this relationship lady!!!", "Have you talked to him about it? He's in wrong; he needs to be doing his part as a parent and around the house. Having kids is hard and it's not the damn 50's anymore. Great that he provides for the family! Still, he's still got to step up and help you with the house and actually be a dad. I love video games and I can get a little too addicted from time to time but the kids come first. It's a bad mentality to have that he provides the money and therefore has no responsibility at home. Too many men (I'm one) still get caught in the \"women's responsibilities\" mindset when it comes to midnight wakings, household chores, and being a present, engaged father. If the tables were turned and you were the breadwinner, I can guarantee that he'd be upset if you did what he's doing.\n\nIf you haven't talked to him about it, then perhaps the \"suck each other off\" comment was overkill. I'm unfortunately in a rough marriage bc my wife is really verbally and emotionally abusive, so hurtful words do hit and cut. However, it's hard to say YAH when he's allowed you to be the only parent and housekeeper while still telling you that YOU ruined HIS life. He needs to grow up. I really can't fault you for what you said in this instance bc you're exhausted and you don't seem to have any help from your partner. Making enough money to support a family in one income is a really amazing thing, especially in today's times. He can and should be proud of that. But - again - TODAY'S times. It's not enough. You need his help and he should be there for you emotionally and physically instead of only financially.\n\nNTA.", "What gets me is that kids are kids for such a short time! I know that the pre-school part feels like forever as it's such a physical hard grind (while still wonderful for a lot of the time) but once they're at school it feels like you blink and they're in their '20s. I was very lucky in that my partnet wanted to spend as much time as possible with them so we were a tight family unit (still are) but op's husband is dipping out on so much while he plays with his friends. Got no sympathy, obviously, he's not fitting his family in at all", "He could be with another woman how you know he\u2019s at friends house why don\u2019t his friend come to you what\u2019s bringing him back to his hometown", "Question: Prior to blowing up (and understandably so!!) have you ever expressed your need for help, a break, time with YOUR friends, etc? I\u2019m guessing, because you keep your house clean, the kids and hubby well-fed, and everything running smoothly, he has *zero* clue of how much it takes to do everything you are doing. \n\nAfter he comes home, I suggest you gift him with a day of being you. Leave him the kids, a list of everything you do in a day, and tell him you expect a home-cooked, nourishing meal when you get home. I figure within a few hours he will be on his knees begging your forgiveness. \n\n\u2022But back to reality: because we all know you won\u2019t leave your kids with him because they probably wouldn\u2019t survive. \n\nAfter you both have calmed down, you two desperately need to sit down and have a rational conversation. Counseling might be helpful too.", "ESH, you are adults who apparently communicate like children. Both of you. I suggest extensive marriage counseling.\n\nPS.

I'm guilty of leaving too much to my wife when it comes to planning, important phone calls, budgeting, etc. I'm working on being better about that. It's so important to listen and adjust. I'm a shit planner and can be really scatterbrained when it comes to planning and timing. However, I do my best to make up for that. I love our 2 kids more than life itself, I handle a lot of the laundry needs, I vacuum and do my share of the dishes, I'm handy and do house maintenance, etc. Granted, I'm 41 and am more mature than I was in my 20's. Still, it's too easy to only look at what one does as a justification for what one doesn't do and leaves to a partner. \n\nI hope that your husband is eventually able to drop any stubbornness and see from your perspective more. That's not only part of parenting and being a household partner; it's a huge & necessary part of marriage. Hang in there but keep future plans of a life separated in your back pocket. If it ever looks to be heading in that direction, you'll want to have a head start.", ">he\u2019d leave us alone and leave me the house.\n\nI'm so sorry you're going through a tough time.  This comment made me laugh, though.  I can appreciate the sentiment.", "Y\u2019all need counseling. You have kids and breaking up without attempting to properly resolve things will only make the situation more difficult.", "Yeah well then I don\u2019t think your need any advice because you all ready kno what u want?", "That\u2019s good, at least you\u2019re self aware and have taken steps to correct it. My husband evidently lacks that fundamental aspect. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s his age or if he\u2019s just super immature. \n\nI thought he\u2019d change but he\u2019s gotten worse over the years. He used to cook sometimes but doesn\u2019t bother anymore or look after the kids will I make dinner.\n\nSo I just make dinner in the afternoon while the kids take their nap. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m pretty much done with this marriage and only staying out of convenience. Once my kids are in nursery I won\u2019t be sticking around him.", "Why would you assume she hasn't tried to resolve things?  Her comments.make it clear she has.  People don't get to the point of leaving over nothing and without trying."]}
