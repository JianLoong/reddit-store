{"id": 4696, "submission_id": "zlpjqy", "title": "AITA for refusing to invite my step-niece to my daughter's Christmas party?", "selftext": "For the last two years, my daughter Mia (10), has had a Christmas party with her friends on the same night I hold an adult Christmas party. This year Mia's party will be a pamper day, followed by a themed \"dinner party\" and a movie night sleepover. A couple of weeks ago Mia asked me if she had to invite her step-cousin, Georgia (11).\n\nFor context, Mia and Georgia have known each other since they were 3/4. When they were young they would play together but when they got older, not so much. I will say Georgia wanted to play with Mia more than the other way round, as Mia grew out of active games quite young. They still sometimes hang out at family gatherings but there have been a couple of instances where Georgia has had to be told to leave Mia alone because she won't accept that Mia doesn't want to play.\n\nBased on this I said Mia doesn't have to invite Georgia to the party (Georgia was invited the past two years because my brother and SIL were coming to the adult party), but that she wasn't allowed to mention the party in front of Georgia because we didn't want her to feel bad. When I sent out invites for my party, SIL called confirming whether there would be a \"kids\" party like last year. I said it was never a kids party, it was Mia's party, and yes she would be having some friends over. SIL didn't get the hint and asked what time she should bring Georgia so I told her that we allowed Mia to choose who to invite and she'd only chosen her friends from school. SIL got mad and asked how I could let Mia's cousin exclude her like this, but I said the girls aren't close, and I have no right to dictate who Mia chooses to invite to her own party. I also said that since Georgia would never know about the party, I'm obviously not intentionally hurting anyone.\n\nA few days later, SIL called and said Georgia now knew about the party so I had to invite her. I said no, I didn't, and the only person who could have told her was SIL or my brother so I was not going to fall for their poorly contrived way to force an invite. SIL got mad again and said she can't believe that I'm teaching my daughter to be a bully just like me, and that she and my brother wouldn't come to my party and might not come to family Christmas because they don't want Georgia to be around people who exclude her. I thought she was bluffing and would get over it but my mom has said that my brother told her he's still trying to persuade SIL to come to Christmas because she's still upset that I wasn't making Georgia feel like \"part of the family\". To me, this has nothing to do with whether Georgia is family, she's not Mia's \\*friend\\* and Mia didn't want her there, end of story. My mom said maybe I should just relent, because Georgia will probably have a terrible time and leave early anyway, and then SIL won't hold it against us. But I don't want to ruin Mia's day to pacify SIL. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I see a lot of people saying I shouldn't have had the parties on the same day because Georgia would know she wasn't invited to the other party, but my party is adult only, Georgia would not have been there to know about Mia's party. It's an adult only cocktail party, no kids will be there.", "created_utc": 1671020484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlpjqy/aita_for_refusing_to_invite_my_stepniece_to_my/", "score": 1064, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should she have to invite someone she barely knows and gets along with? To make Georgia and SIL happy? Hell no. You have every right to not allow someone to a party. \n\nIt just seems like Mia and Georgia are very different young girls who don\u2019t really match together, with Mia growing out of things quicker than Georgia and Georgia being told to leave Mia alone, no wonder Mia doesn\u2019t want her there. \n\nAgain you are NTA OP.", "I see a lot of adults here seemingly inviting people to their parties that they actually don't like...\r  \n\r  \nOf course, all you need to do is invite people you like to a Christmas party you like. What a BS. NTA, But SIL is.", "INFO: I am confused, Mia will have her party (for which I agree she should invite only whoever she wanted) and at the same day and time you will have your adults only party. Georgia is not invited but you invited your SIL and brother to your party. How did you think this will go? Please correct me if I didn't understand something", "NTA; I for one, support teaching your children that no means no, and that they don\u2019t have to be pressured into doing something they don\u2019t want to do. It sucks her feelings were hurt, but you can\u2019t always get your way.", "NTA, but having a an christmas for just adults and a separate party for children that the people invited to the adult party cannot bring their kids to is obviously recipe for disaster. You couldn't have set this up in a more foolish way if you'd tried.", "NTA \n\nIt's your daughter's party and she wants her friends. Also you SIL tried to bully you into inviting her daughter", "\nTwo separate parties, same location , same day is my understanding.  Last  years step niece invited to kids party and brother/sil invited to adults.\n\nI don\u2019t see an issue with Mia setting her own invite list. The misstep from my perspective is not calling your brother and giving him a heads up. There has been a precedent that Georgia has been invited to the kids party. My child is roughly the same age and remembers things. If this was him he\u2019d ask if the party was happening.  That\u2019s him, he understands that he doesn\u2019t get to go to everything, friend groups change, etc. So anticipating that Georgia would probably find out is realistic. Also, with the parties being the same day, they are probably linked in their minds and think oh we\u2019re family, of course we\u2019lll get invited\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey brother, just want to give you a heads up the invite to our cocktail party are going out this week. This year Mia wants her party to be school friends only and we are supporting her in that decision. Giving you a heads up if she asks you guys about it.  As the girls grow older it\u2019s natural that they\u2019d gravitate to their own friend groups. Hope you\u2019ll be able to make the party\u201d\n\nRelationships change , especially with kids, it\u2019s hard when one of the kids likes hanging out the other more. If SiL perceived it that there were no issues with the kids and you perceived it that Mia doesn\u2019t want to hang to Georgia as much, this was a natural progression for you and maybe for SIL/brother, this feels like it\u2019s coming out of left field.\n\n\nNTA for letting Mia decide her list, but I think you could have managed this better. Especially since this is your brother, think about if they didn\u2019t ask before hand how it would have played out when they showed up and saw the other party. They\u2019d probably have been hurt and if I was them I would think \u201c were family, why wouldn\u2019t you let me know?\u201d\n\nI understand SIl not wanted to come to your party, she may want to do something whrh Georgia the day of your party, but her adding Christmas into the mix is manipulative. \n\nIf it was me, I\u2019d follow up with brother and tell him that you are sorry for not giving them the heads up about MIa\u2019s party. These are 2 seperate parties with different guest lists. Years prior, you worked in the list with Mia more and this year she wanted to set it herself and have it just friends. You agree and support that, but looking back, you\u2019d let them know so if Georgia asked , they\u2019d be able to frame it her.", "NTA. Your SIL isn't in a good position to accuse you of bullying, since she's openly trying to bully an invite for her daughter. It's specifically Mia's party, not an open kids party, so Mia can invite whoever she wants. She doesn't want to deal with her cousin. If because of that your brother & SIL don't feel able to attend your Christmas party, that's fine, they don't have to.", "Quick question, is it just Mia's friends that are going or are there any other kids from your family invited?", "INFO Were brother and SIL coming to the adult Christmas party this year prior to the daughter not being invited to the kid's party?", "By 10 your daughter should get to decide who comes to her party or not. However for me it's how you tried to keep it a secret, because that was only going to end badly. You being the adult and supporting your daughters decision to keep Georgia off the guest list should of called you SIL and brother and had an adult conversation on why she wasn't invited. It was always going to be a hard conversation so instead you decided to hide it. To me that makes you the AH here.\n\nSO YTA, not because Georgia wasn't invited but because of the sneakiness in hiding her not being invited and asking your daughter to be in on the sneakiness.", "Honestly? I'd have Mia throw a party ANY OTHER DAY than this one.\n\nFrom now on, you know it's going to be an issue. If you really feel that Georgia can't be included, it's a lot of turmoil to prove your point. She's been invited the last 2 years -  you're asking your SIL/BIL to literally lie to her (she'll surely ask about this year's party) if she asks.\n\nIt's your choice whether you want to die on this hill. Is it truly going to \"ruin Mia's day\"? Or is reality that Mia would PREFER not to have Georgia, but it's not like the world is coming to an end (even if she's a dramatic tween). Were you ever excluded as a child from someone's party? Is that how you want to treat Georgia?\n\nI also think you need to be honest about how you portray Georgia (*\"she won't accept that Mia doesn't want to play\", \"Georgia wanted to play with Mia more than the other way round\", \"Mia grew out of active games quite young\"*). Your judgement is almost visible from here.\n\nSo, I guess after all that.... yes, gently, YTA", "YTA.", "Jesus people no you don\u2019t have to be around people who you don\u2019t like. Christmas time, Easter, thanksgiving none of that is an excuse to have someone you don\u2019t particularly enjoy having around around. That takes a worse situation and makes it into an even worse situation especially for children.", "NTA for listening to your daughter but it kind of sounds like the OP wants things go her way and is shocked that SIL won't come to the party. No, Mia doesn't have to invite Georgia, but SIL doesn't have to go to OP's party either. If brother and SIL go to the adult party, then I assume Georgia will have to be by herself or with a babysitter. She might have realized at that point either way. OP just needs to understand that standing up for her daughter, which is the right thing to do, is going to hurt some people's feelings. This whole, \"don't tell Georgia about the party\" was a bit unrealistic hope to begin with. She's 11. She isn't going to understand why she was excluded if no one sits down with her and let's her know, and OP needs to understand and accept that there are sometimes consequences we don't like even when we are doing the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nIt's pretty simple. Mias party, Mias guest list.", "NTA\n\nNow we know where Georgia learned to ignore other people\u2019s feelings. SIL has probably told the poor girl to force herself on Mia even when Mia asks to be alone because \u201cshe\u2019s part of the family.\u201d OP should have lied to SIL and said a school friend was having the party.\n\nI understand where people are coming from re: having the parties on different days, but not so much to hide it from Georgia, but to hide it from her mother.", "NTA. Good for you and standing up for your daughters wishes. It\u2019s miserable being around someone you don\u2019t want to be around. Here\u2019s my best example to prove it: \n\nWhen I was growing up I had a childhood best friend and she had a little baby brother. Her little brother was obnoxious, a crybaby, clingy, and cussed like a sailor (their father was a badly behaved man)\u2026 at only about 4 years old. Her parents were always drunk and even when they were home, it seemed like they never wanted to take care of him because he\u2019d be pushed onto us. If we said we didn\u2019t want to play with him, or even tell him that to his face; her and I would get in trouble. I mean, what little girl wants to play with a little baby boy? Let alone her annoying little brother. \n\nSo, without fail, every time for my birthday parties\u2014 something would happen and my party would suddenly become about her baby brother and us having to play with him. We had big swimming parties and a lot of my friends were always there. If he didn\u2019t get enough attention from either his sister or me, he\u2019d have a fucking meltdown. During that time, my parents were too busy partying with their friends to care, but the times they did notice, I wonder if they spoke about it with her parents? Either way, I think a lot of it was a parenting issue and neglect. \n\nAnyways, it\u2019s your daughters party. Don\u2019t let anyone bully you into doing something you or your daughter don\u2019t want to do. Yes, her cousin will probably be sad to hear\u2026 but that\u2019s life and boundaries. Hopefully your brother and sister-in-law will realize one day that your decision makes sense when their daughter says they don\u2019t want to invite a specific kid to her birthday parties. It happens.", "YTA Not because you aren't forcing your daughter to invite someone she doesn't want to her party BUT because you knew you weren't going to extend an invite to their child but invited her parents to a party at the same location at the same time. There was no way this wasn't going to happen the way it did. The only way you could have possibly avoided this was to not invite the entire family but to think you could invite the adults and not the kid to a yearly event and not cause issues is insane.  \n  \n If your daughter was having a stand alone party any other time there's no issues here at all but the fact that it's a dual party means it's one of those occasions where you tell your daughter yes you have to invite her because she's going to come over with her parents anyway and it's polite.", "NTA. It\u2019s Mia\u2019s party and she is not obligated to invite anyone. As some of my cousins and I got older we made our own friends, grew apart, and stopped being invited to one another\u2019s parties. It happens and doesn\u2019t make anyone an AH.", "YTA if Georgia has been over during your adult party time, two years in a row, she will know she is being excluded \n\nWhile I also agree your daughter should not be forced to invite people who are not her \u2018friend\u2019, you are setting yourself up for a no win situation by still having her party on the same day. \n\nGeorgia will know , her parents won\u2019t have to tell her. \n\nSometimes (not always) we have to do things we don\u2019t want to and include people we don\u2019t want to, because it\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nLike in this case, I believe if you plan to hold your tradition, inviting Georgia would be the right thing to do", "YTA - this party is essentially the more elaborate equivalent of having a \u201ckids table\u201d at a family dinner. If this was your daughter having her own party that would be one thing but this is in tandem with yours. \n\nYou\u2019ve invited your cousin and their spouse but youre excluding their kid? Of course you\u2019re going to look like an AH here. Theyre family, albeit step, but have known each other their whole life.", "NAH it is of course fine for the party to exclude people you don\u2019t want to invite, however our actions are not free from consequence and if the people we are excluding are close family members then there will be some upset, especially when children are involved", "INFO: so what you are saying is, the past years they have come to the adult party and their child hasn\u2019t needed a baby sitter because she was at your daughters party? Who was the adult in charge of them?", "More and more in life, I\u2019m seeing this completely selfish, empathy lacking pov become more prevalent and acceptable, and it makes me sad. \n\nThe question is not whether you or Mia have the right to curate your guest list how you want. Yes, everyone has the right to do what they want. But the question is does that make you an asshole? And I\u2019d say it does.\n\nGA knows about the party, her parents know about the party. I think it was an AH move to not even give your SIL a heads up. Speaking as a parent, if I was in SIL\u2019s position, I would have at the very least, appreciated you talking to me about it beforehand. Not having to ask you after the invites were given. That seems like you can\u2019t even acknowledge the fact that you know it\u2019s going to hurt. You treated it as a non issue. And then you doubled down by playing semantics of specifying it was Mia\u2019s party and not a kids\u2019 party. Like, you acted completely ignorant and pretended to not realize what this info meant to them. It would hurt on a SIL level, I would also be hurt for my kid. I would be offended that you invited me without even mentioning my kid, because of how it\u2019s gone the years before. \n\nIf I were you, I would have talked to my kid about the importance of family. I would have stressed that the exclusion would have hurt Georgia. I would have asked how she would have felt if it were the other way around. I would have wanted to teach my daughter the importance of sometimes doing something she didn\u2019t really want to, for the benefit of making someone else feel good. \n\nAre any of you obligated to do this? Absolutely not. But this isn\u2019t \u2018am I obligated?\u2019 It\u2019s AITA. And I do believe YTA.\n\nAnd I also wonder if you would be just as cool with this if Georgia was your bio-niece.", "Mia can invite who she wants yes.\n\nHowever, I feel bad for Georgia. \nCrappy parenting made this so much worse for her. Her spirit probably got more crushed by the way this was handled and is probably not getting to the emotional support needed to be guided through this.  \n\n\"Sorry Mia only invited school friends\" - stings a little.\n\nInstead she got consistent rejection while the parents battled to make their points. \n\nThat rejection is going to run deep.", "Ok so parents will be at your party one floor above the other kids. Kids are not allowed at your party. Niece is not allowed at Mia party. So what is supposed to happen to Niece? Stay home alone, knowing exactly where her parents are and the rest of the family are, but she is not welcome?", "I think there are a lot of variety in the comments because it\u2019s not completely clear about the two parties. A few thoughts about that:\n1)The adult and kids parties are on the same day each year, so people that are aware of both would expect that trend to continue. \n2) even though the parties are separate (different starting times, different themes), it seems like the location - OP\u2019s house is the same for at least part of both parties. \n3) It\u2019s unclear if there are other families besides OP\u2019s and SIL\u2019s that have had family members attend the two parties before.\n\nBecause of #1 and #2, I can definitely see why some responses consider the two parties to be a single party with separate activities for kids. Frankly, whether it\u2019s described as one or two parties, there\u2019s overlap in terms of date, location, and some guest families. Additionally, expectations have been set based on prior year\u2019s invitations. People that have previously been invited to parties multiple times will OF COURSE notice the trend and expect that the parties will happen this year. And even if the people were really oblivious, I\u2019m guessing guests of one party would see signs of the other party happening. \n\nAll this means that there was basically no possible way that the cousin wouldn\u2019t have found out she was being snubbed. YTA", "YTA - you\u2019re giving off mean girl vibes too.", "YTA in blurring the lines of the parties. Mia absolutely does not have to invite anyone she doesn\u2019t want to her party. However, you really made it sound like this was a kids party and adults party but all part of the same event. So for the past 2 years, your SIL\u2019s whole family came to what she saw as one holiday event only now to find out it really isn\u2019t. Yeah, it\u2019s kind of crappy. It all could have been avoided by having Mia\u2019s party on a different day.", "NTA, not a bully.  SIL needs a dictionary.  Needs to read coercion  and then read bully.  SIL is the bully here.  Do not give in to the bully.  Party host and wedding party are always allowed to control guest list.  Nobody is entitled to an invite.  That includes children.", "YTA for trying to make out that these are 2 separate parties, when in reality you are having a party in your house whilst your daughter has a sleepover with her friends upstairs. I understand you respecting your daughter's wishes as to who she wants to invite to \"her party\", however you have created this situation by inviting your SIS/Brother to your party that their child has attended with them in the past. Georgia would know that previous years there has been a sleepover, and therefore now knows that she's been excluded (even if the reasons for doing so are valid from your daughter's POV). These are not 2 separate parties and it's unfair to exclude someone when you have previously set the precedent.", "NTA\n\nSIL wants free babysitting.  It would probably be best to just uninvite SIL from your party.  She's being manipulative and will continue to cause issues.", "I N F O, do any of the other adults at your party have kids, and if so are they invited to mias party?\n\nEdit: then I say NTA, this isn't an event where families are invited and kids go one place with adults elsewhere, the guests lists aren't connected/same", "NTA. When I was younger and had parties my mom forced me to invite kids to them that I wasn\u2019t friends with cause they were her friends kids. Some of them weren\u2019t nice to me either and didn\u2019t invite me to their parties in return. Mia wants to have a fun party with her friends. It sounds like Georgia is clingy to Mia and Mia doesn\u2019t like it. She has every right to set boundaries and tell her mom she doesn\u2019t want her at the party. Georgia wouldn\u2019t have known if her mom hadn\u2019t told her in an attempt to manipulate an invite and now she\u2019s hurt her own daughter\u2019s feelings. Mia is setting boundaries and SIL doesn\u2019t like it.\n\nEdit to add: No one is entitled to an invite, even if they\u2019re family. SIL is teaching Georgia that she\u2019s entitled to an invite even though she\u2019s not wanted. All the people saying YTA are saying that she should be where she isn\u2019t wanted; which will probably make her feel more excluded since Mia and the others will ignore her.", "I'm going NTA. But with the request for INFO: are there any other cousins who were/were not invited? I'm an only child and remember having parties where my cousins were not invited because I was the only girl in our family for 20+ years and the boys didn't want to do chalk art and nail painting. I was invited to our neighbors birthday party and it was awkward but I chose to go. She turned 5 and I was 8 and her mom didn't want me to feel weird. Incidentally I pinned the tail on that donkey first try because I had great spacial control. \n\nIf Georgia and Mia's personalities are that different (which I suspect they are) Georgia wouldn't have fun anyway and would feel outcasted.

Not helpful at all", "I mean, ugh. So on the actual question, NTA, your kid has the right to invite/exclude who she wants. But the planning on this is poor.

They don't share similar interests right now and Mia feels she's not a friend. This is a normal part of childhood. Her party is just friends from school, not all the cousins except Georgia, so as long as Mia isn't mean to Georgia just because they don't have the same interests, it's not bullying. \n\nYou were an asshole for trying to avoid having the difficult conversation with your SIL. There is no \"picking up hints\". This is your family, Georgia is only 11, and she was invited two years in a row. You were always going to have to tell SIL directly that Mia feels Georgia and her are not close and she just wants school friends at the party, that you understand Georgia may feel hurt but that it's just a painful part of growing up. Mia is 10, Georgia was going to find out she was excluded sooner or later so being so dismissive of how it looks was a mistake. \n\nyour SIL has a right to be hurt on behalf of her daughter and express that she's feeling hurt for Georgia. Georgia may not have a lot of friends at school, and may have thought her and Mia are closer than they are. However, it's one of those times where her and her husband have to talk to Georgia and explain that its a fact of growing up, people grow apart even when they are family. If Georgia does have one or two friends, she should have proposed maybe doing her own pre Christmas celebration just them.  SIL was TA for just blatantly telling her the party is happening, thinking that means she gets to go. It's a missed learning and growing opportunity for her daughter, and frankly a stupid and mean thing to do. \n\nIf you all talk again, I would start by acknowledging that you understand this hurts Georgia's feelings, and that you did not want that for her, but that you want Mia to have the independence of picking her own friends and celebrating with them. Don't just start by saying you did nothing wrong, because you've both handled it poorly.", "NTA. Georgia is not raised well enough to be considerate of others wishes and feelings and Mia does not want her company. Georgia's mom is manipulative and probably the reason why Georgia was raised in such a way to not consider other kids wishes and feelings.", "I am super torn because while I don\u2019t think Mia should have to have her cousin, it seems like the parents assume (Mia\u2019s) it\u2019s just like a babysitting party so kids can come and parents can drink. \n\nI think Georgias parents are jerks for just telling Georgia about the \u201ckids\u201d party when it\u2019s not a kids party. I also think it sucks they are bailing on Christmas over this. \n\nHonestly I think the only way to make this work out in the years going forward is to host the parties on 2 separate nights. So the adults only party is legit adults only with no kids in the home at all. So when asked if there is a kids party you can answer and say nope. Then host Mia\u2019s party another weekend, that way Sil doesn\u2019t feel Georgia has a right to be there. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m going ESH (except poor Georgia who is just being thrown into the middle and all of this, and being used as a pawn by her mom.)", "NTA, but the whole setup was not well-planed. Your daughter absolutely has the right to choose with whom she wants to interact, and it's good that you listen to her wishes... \n\nBut having the two parties at the same day and in the same house is obviously not the smartest choise. Doesn't make you an AH, but these problems could have been at least partially avoided.\n\nRegarding the argument that Georgia will feel excluded... Yeah, that's just how it is. There's no perfect solution; either Mia is going to feel bad or Georgia is. But Georgia is the one that needs to learn to respect Mia's boundaries here; not vice versa.", "NTA.

So there are probably plenty of adults who have kids who stay home that night because they aren't friends with Mia. \n\nHowever - how many of the kids who come for Mia's party have adults at your party? I suspect generally there isn't much family overlap which makes it a bit easier to keep them distinct. The problem is now you've had overlap previously with your brother and sil at your party and Georgia at Mia's. \n\nI'm not saying invite Georgia, but perhaps moving forward having Mia's party on a different day would be helpful in terms of separating the events and to avoid future backlash.

She is old enough to choose her guest list and have the party she wants.  The rude one is SIL for forcing the issue.  And for telling her daughter about the party and making it a family deal. I understand that she is hurt for her daughter and is reacting emotionally as a result. But, even if she succeeded in forcing an invite, her daughter would be miserable.  An unwanted guest with primarily people she doesn't know? That's a no win for Georgia or SIL. Georgia feels left out either way. All of which could have been avoided if SIL didn't tell Georgia.  Would Mia be resistant to perhaps planning something for her and Georgia to do together on another day, just the 2 of them?", "NTA - To force your daughter to invite someone they don\u2019t get along with and did not want to her party is teaching your daughter to be unhappy in her own world. You do you, and what is right for your child. I also don\u2019t see an issue with you having a party on the same day as your daughter! I think it is a very good idea to teach children these days to socialize and not depend on electronics.  The fact that they told their daughter after they already knew that she was not invited was very vindictive. The whole party would be strained, and uncomfortable for all that attended. I would disinvite them from your party as well.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems that many posters here are thinking that your party is a \"family\" party, under which circumstances, yes, I think you'd be in the wrong for disinviting your niece.  But my reading indicates that what you're ACTUALLY having is a party to which your brother and SIL are invited, while also hosting a sleepover for your daughter and her friends.\n\nI've got a 10 year old daughter myself.  And she comprehends that sometimes she isn't going to get invited to something that she wishes she was.  Because that's life-you don't get to do all of the things that you want to.  Do you know what I DON'T do? I don't force the issue.  She needs to learn that things don't always go her way.\n\nI understand that Mia is possibly outgrowing her friendship with Georgia.  That happens-it's happening with my daughter and one of her friends right now.  I'm baffled why Georgia can't be told that Mia is hosting her classmates this year; are Georgia's wants more important than Mia's? 10- and 11-year-olds aren't babies.  They are learning to navigate the world and develop the understanding that things aren't always \"fair\". These are necessary emotional skills that come from experiencing frustration and disappointment.  I'd say as long as Mia continues to treat Georgia kindly at actual family events, she's fulfilling her duties as far as being a decent human being is concerned.

OP's brother and SIL have had several years to teach her to leave other people alone if the other people don't want to play. Also, no one is entitled to an invitation even from relatives. \n\nAnother point that is jumping out at me is that SIL seems to see Mia's party as free babysitting while the adults are having another party. SIL doesn't seem to respect Mia except as a playmate for her daughter. All the comments about the adult party and Mia's party are not separate parties are missing the point.

At the end of the day it\u2019s clear that Mia doesn\u2019t want to be friendly with Georgia and that means her not being invited to a party. If Georgia were to ask about it I would be 100% honest and clear with her\u2026Mia hasn\u2019t invited you to her party because she doesn\u2019t want to and doesn\u2019t HAVE to. They aren\u2019t close. They aren\u2019t friends so why does Georgia have to go? It sucks but that\u2019s life.", "If my dislike for them is, \u201cthey\u2019re kind of annoying but otherwise harmless\u201d and inviting them could avoid a family fracture, then yeah, that\u2019s probably worth that small bit of sacrifice.\n\nPeople here act like there\u2019s only one variable at play (one kid who doesn\u2019t like another kid), when family dynamics are never as clean cut as that. \n\nThe two parties are happening at the same time in the same house\u2014Georgia\u2019s parents (along with, I\u2019m assuming, the rest of their relatives) would have been to the one upstairs, while Georgia sat at home by herself. As much as OP is trying to justify how Georgia is \u201cnot being excluded\u201d, she will in fact be the only one of that family who won\u2019t be under OP\u2019s roof celebrating on that given night. If OP is okay with her brother and SIL not coming, and if she\u2019s okay fundamentally changing the basis of how her family interacts with theirs within the broader scope of their extended family unit, then have at it. But she\u2019s at best being disingenuous to insist Georgia won\u2019t have known and will not have had her feelings hurt at being excluded. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have happened the night of the party, but once the holiday season passed, she\u2019ll realize she was never invited to the party she\u2019s historically always gone to. \n\nSIL sucks for obvious reasons.", "Exactly!\n\nThe parents could have gotten a babysitter since the party was adults only and told their daughter they were going out and never mentioned the parties and Georgia would not have known.", "Naah, this would only be acceptable if she hadn\u2019t been invited prior years or if the kids party was on a totally different day/time/place as the adult party.  The in-laws even asked if there would be a kids version party like the previous years\u2026 C\u2019mon guys, that\u2019s just mean. \n\nIf it was OP\u2019s kid\u2019s birthday party, or something that\u2019s a different story, but an 10 year old doesn\u2019t need to hold a xmas party, and the two parties are kinda linked at this point.", "What?? B/c their kids are invited\u2026", "What does it matter?? If the two parties don\u2019t interact, then they\u2019re separate.", "Sorry, I thought it was obvious since I said they were having a sleepover. My bad.", "I think most people would consider a kids party in this context to be a babysitting service. That\u2019s not unreasonable.\n\nIf OP wants to be all about his kid\u2019s social autonomy, don\u2019t make her party at the same time and place as the adults-only adult party. Like I know it\u2019s a big thing on this website to rag on \u201centitled parents,\u201d but come *on*, OP is being really obtuse. And honestly, he\u2019s putting his *own* kid in a shitty position.", "Yeah im torn on this one. I totally understand why Georgias parents would be upset. Sounds like Georgia is more into Mia too, so it totally must have hurt her feelings. What parents would not feel bad about that", "If the children at Mia\u2019s party are (at least for the most part) not the children of the adults at OP\u2019s party then yes they do sound like they are separate parties. That\u2019s a really different situation than inviting adults with their own children and then hosting the children downstairs", "They're 10, with a houseful of adults up a flight of stairs.  They don't need babysitters.", "THAT part. It\u2019s not that she had to be invited. But it\u2019s super obtuse to think that she wouldn\u2019t think about a kids party that she participated in the previous two years during the adult party her parents went too, was happening again during an adult party that her parents were again going too. Especially since it\u2019s in the same house.", "Valid question", "I should have, I see that now, for sure.\n\nGeorgia was the only child who ever had parents attending, even last year.", "But at the same time, you\u2019re raising your kid to push someone else\u2019s boundaries. We had a kid just like Georgia in our extended family. His parents were family friends and they always brought him around. And he was so annoying. He made us share everything we had with him, he would cry to his parents if we said we didn\u2019t want to play, and he was very rude. It sounds like her kid is fed up and doesn\u2019t want her at the party. No one teaches their kids that not everyone wants to be friends. \n\nI would\u2019ve told my kid \u201chey, Mia is only inviting kids from school this year. But we\u2019ll have a movie night and eat snacks and order pizza.\u201d", "Oh no, she's in the shit position of having to parent her child. How terrible. \ud83d\ude44", "THIS! Im wondering if OP talked this through with her daughter? Like, ok you dont want to invite her why is that? How do you think that will make her feel? Etc. Children dont always think that far ahead, and its important to teach them how their actions will affect others. Its not like shes forcing her to do, she just making her think about it.", "I totally agree. And the way she is arguing here in the comments and what her arguments are makes it clear she never would even entertain the idea that she was the AH, she just wanted to come here to confirm she was right. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if OP was right or not, but Op has to be delusional if she is surprised that this was a possible outcome. Like is it all that shocking that her SIL is upset her kid wasn\u2019t included? And not everyone will take \u201cdifferent floors\u201d as a totally separate event, since it\u2019s the same house and time", "And it sounds like the only reason they don\u2019t want to invite the cousin is because she didn\u2019t outgrow playing like OP\u2019s 10 y/o daughter did. I get kind of a mean-girl-in-training vibe.", "Maybe, maybe not.  The only reason she knows now is because (probably) SIL told her about it.\n\nThis could have been handled so smoothly.\n\n\"Your cousin Mia is turning X age this year and is no longer doing what she used to do.  Why don't you see if friend X will have you over for the night your dad and I are going to the adults only cocktail party?\"", "The adult party happens to take place while Mia's party is going on, but Mia's party starts hours earlier than\nOP's and is a sleepover that doesn't end until the next day.\n\nIt's not the same as if Mia's friends arrived at the same time as OP's guests and left at the same time as well.", "By that logic, a restaurant/venue that\u2019s hosting 2 weddings at the same time (or 1 wedding, 1 birthday) is really hosting 1 giant event? You can have 2 separate parties happening at the same time, at the same location.\n\nThe only people that\u2019s related between the 2 parties is OP and OP\u2019s kid, both of whom are hosting their events on the same day at their home. To me, those are separate events.", "I understand they\u2019re happening in the same house, my understanding that the bulk of the kids party was during the \u201cday\u201d before the adult party even started. If I misunderstood, that\u2019s obviously fine, but I wouldn\u2019t consider those events to be two joint parties regardless.", "The 10yo is controlling the list of her own party. By this logic, should parents of the kids coming to Mia's party be upset that they are not invited to the adult party because \"it's happening at the same time\"?", "I wouldn't say harassed, she just gets pushy. She'll ask constantly after Mia has said no, try bargaining with her to get her to play etc. I wouldn't call it bullying, it's just a lack of understanding boundaries I guess.", "Drinks, yes. People becoming obviously intoxicated have to leave. I have enough trauma from people who can't handle their drink, and I will not have drunk people in my house.", "Right? Since when is having boundaries and not immediately bending them to boundary stompers in any way \u201cmean girl\u201d behavior? The only mean girl here is the sister who intentionally told her daughter she wasn\u2019t invited so she could weaponize her pain in a sad attempt to force an invite.", "She's raising a mini me. This isn't a birthday party. This is a select Christmas party she's having. Just like Mom.", "It's a movie night and sleepover. Downstairs.", "THANK YOU!!!!! In ten years they'd be on here calling Georgia entitled for being mad she wasn't invited. This is exactly how entitlement grows. She's 11, she's old enough to learn better.", "No. You cant force people into relationships. But you can be civil. Which is it's even more bewildering that OP is confused as to why the mother of the child being excluded is now refusing a relationship.", "Just because she was invited previously doesn't entitle her to being invited now. The kids' party isn't a family party; OP was right to let her daughter choose who she wanted to invite instead of forcing her to invite someone she's not friends with.", "Because Georgia had been invited other years and OP thought Brother and SIL \u2026 just wouldnt notice there was another party happening downstairs that their daughter was now excluded from", "So its the same party and the kids just go play downstairs.", "OP, I'm all for kids autonomy, but come on. You know you have created a situation here where there would only be hurt feelings within your family. You know that. I know that. There is this oush these days to ensure our children are heard and validated, but many times that can also be at the expense of excluding others just because our kid is mean? Now I am not saying your Mia is mean. I'm not. And she can pick who she wants to have over for her parties and sleep overs. But when you invite family over and exclude their children at the other party, you know what this is going to do. Yeah, great. You want Mia to have a party SHE wants - well then teach her a lesson here: there are times to be self-centered and there are times we bite the bullet and be gracious. Mia can a have  an \"Only Mia friends party\" on nights when you are not inviting family over. And yes, I get it. its not just a family thing; but people don't stop being your family. You have created a rift here in your family. You have. And while it is no one's \"fault\", you are teaching a lesson here to these two girls that will carry with them for the rest of their lives and will spill over into your relationships with your own family. I would also spend some time considering WHY bullying these days are so pervasive. is it because we have been allowing our children to exclude others that they don't absolutely ADORE every single moment of every single day of their entire lives because it is their choice? And how will that message carry over into adulthood? What future effects will this have on your child? On your niece? There are levels of relationships, and you just told your whole family whose yours and your daughter's is. So slight YTA.", "It doesn't sound like any of the other guests to the adult party have their children at Mia's party. so no, it does not. Mia's friends are at her function, which *happened* to include her step-cousin last two years but doesn't this year.", "So you think that the 11 year old should have to babysit any kids the adult guests want to drop off with Mia? \n\nGeorgia was included for 2 years due to close age and likely in an attempt to bond with the in-laws but the girls seem to have nothing in common so Georgia herself shouldn\u2019t want to go anyway to a party where all other girls are friends and she\u2019s the odd girl out.\n\nThat\u2019s not OP & Mia being mean or bullies. It\u2019s wanting to enjoy a drama-free evening.", "Not really, though. It's just a bigger guest list. Mia has guests. OP (and partner?) has guests. They go to separate places in the same house to do their own thing because you hang out with people you like who do things you enjoy. That sounds like every family party I've ever attended in my life.", "They don't need people completely on top of them, but they need people in case of emergency and to at least keep a bit of an eye on things. There's a freaking \"cinema room,\" are the adults not involved at all? They won't need any help?\n\n\nI'm not talking about a constant babysitter,  but OP is acting like the adults wouldn't even notice the kids being there at all.", "Oh but they can't go upstairs, or the adults would know there is a kids party going on in the same building, which OP maintains they couldn't possibly find out.", "Who\u2019s serving them dinner? They are 10 doubt they are preparing it and cleaning up after it themselves.", "Very true. She's going to gather up the validating comments like a mean girl troll and go back under her bridge content in her righteousness.", "Or hotels with multiple ballrooms hosting multiple events, but have the same management overseeing the staff for all of them?", "This isnt \u201cher own party\u201d. Its the same party and the kids are just downstairs.", "I suspect her mother has encouraged this (yes, I realize OP said that SIL tells Georgia to leave Mia alone, but look how boundary stopping SIL was here, I do not entirely believe SIL is reinforcing respect of boundaries when other people are not watching). Seriously, your SIL doesn\u2019t respect boundaries and uses Georgia\u2019s feelings as a weapon-ex: why did she tell Georgia about the party? Did it never occur to her that if her manipulation failed to work, Georgia would be the one who was hurt? It is irrelevant that she blames OP/Mia, her daughter never needed to know about this rejection and now she does.", "This party sounds like itll be a blast, can I get an invite?", "Exactly! The sisters the only AH here, subjecting her daughter to that. Poor kid seems sheltered and is gonna have a bad time if her mom doesn't step-up and teach her that she's not entitled to go to every party and social event.", "That\u2019s a big assumption you\u2019re making off of very little evidence. I think you\u2019re projecting more than anything", "Except it sounds like the kids who are invited to the kid party are Mia\u2019s friends from school so it\u2019s not the kids in attendance are the children of the adults at the party. That sounds pretty separate to me. OP just tells her friends \u201coh my daughter invited her friends over for a sleepover tonight. They are hanging out downstairs.\u201d", "I'm gonna be the person to chime in here and say, you can have two separate events in one house, it's not that hard. I sure as hell wouldn't send my 10 year old child off to another place (or leave them home alone) to *host* an entire Christmas dinner party.\n\nOP is NTA 100%.

That simply is not what this is.\n\nThe parents are having a cocktail party for themselves and their friends upstairs. The daughter is having a party for only her friends in the basement at the same time. **Either of those events could be moved and not affect the other. They are not contingent upon one another.** Are some of the children of invitees friends with OP\u2019s daughter? Maybe, but she also said that it\u2019s primarily friends from school.", "How is it the same party if no one from the separate groups interact? What kind of parties do you go to where the hosts segregate and isolate the guests?", "Literally!!! And she thinks cousin is to stupid to not realize there was a party even there always has been? Mia is allowed to invite who she wants, but OP needs to know feelings are going to be hurt.", "OP said in a comment that he hired babysitters for this party. Hence, the very understandable perception that this is a babysitting party. OP is the one creating drama by being dense about this and not giving his kid her own party that is clearly intended as such.", "They are 10. 10 is old enough to stay home alone in most states. OP will probably check on them periodically.

It's not an \"everyone who's invited can bring their kids and there will be activities for them\", that's what makes it a separate party.", "Why is this so hard for you guys to understand.\n\nThey are separate parties.
