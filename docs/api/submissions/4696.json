{"id": 4696, "submission_id": "zlpjqy", "title": "AITA for refusing to invite my step-niece to my daughter's Christmas party?", "selftext": "For the last two years, my daughter Mia (10), has had a Christmas party with her friends on the same night I hold an adult Christmas party. This year Mia's party will be a pamper day, followed by a themed \"dinner party\" and a movie night sleepover. A couple of weeks ago Mia asked me if she had to invite her step-cousin, Georgia (11).\n\nFor context, Mia and Georgia have known each other since they were 3/4. When they were young they would play together but when they got older, not so much. I will say Georgia wanted to play with Mia more than the other way round, as Mia grew out of active games quite young. They still sometimes hang out at family gatherings but there have been a couple of instances where Georgia has had to be told to leave Mia alone because she won't accept that Mia doesn't want to play.\n\nBased on this I said Mia doesn't have to invite Georgia to the party (Georgia was invited the past two years because my brother and SIL were coming to the adult party), but that she wasn't allowed to mention the party in front of Georgia because we didn't want her to feel bad. When I sent out invites for my party, SIL called confirming whether there would be a \"kids\" party like last year. I said it was never a kids party, it was Mia's party, and yes she would be having some friends over. SIL didn't get the hint and asked what time she should bring Georgia so I told her that we allowed Mia to choose who to invite and she'd only chosen her friends from school. SIL got mad and asked how I could let Mia's cousin exclude her like this, but I said the girls aren't close, and I have no right to dictate who Mia chooses to invite to her own party. I also said that since Georgia would never know about the party, I'm obviously not intentionally hurting anyone.\n\nA few days later, SIL called and said Georgia now knew about the party so I had to invite her. I said no, I didn't, and the only person who could have told her was SIL or my brother so I was not going to fall for their poorly contrived way to force an invite. SIL got mad again and said she can't believe that I'm teaching my daughter to be a bully just like me, and that she and my brother wouldn't come to my party and might not come to family Christmas because they don't want Georgia to be around people who exclude her. I thought she was bluffing and would get over it but my mom has said that my brother told her he's still trying to persuade SIL to come to Christmas because she's still upset that I wasn't making Georgia feel like \"part of the family\". To me, this has nothing to do with whether Georgia is family, she's not Mia's \\*friend\\* and Mia didn't want her there, end of story. My mom said maybe I should just relent, because Georgia will probably have a terrible time and leave early anyway, and then SIL won't hold it against us. But I don't want to ruin Mia's day to pacify SIL. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I see a lot of people saying I shouldn't have had the parties on the same day because Georgia would know she wasn't invited to the other party, but my party is adult only, Georgia would not have been there to know about Mia's party. It's an adult only cocktail party, no kids will be there.\n\nEDIT2: I'm getting a lot of questions about whether other guest's kids would be at Mia's party - No. Last year, Georgia was the only child with parents attending the cocktail party. None of Mia's friends parents were or are invited to the cocktail party, there is no overlap.", "created_utc": 1671020484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlpjqy/aita_for_refusing_to_invite_my_stepniece_to_my/", "score": 7034, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should she have to invite someone she barely knows and gets along with? To make Georgia and SIL happy? Hell no. You have every right to not allow someone to a party. \n\nIt just seems like Mia and Georgia are very different young girls who don\u2019t really match together, with Mia growing out of things quicker than Georgia and Georgia being told to leave Mia alone, no wonder Mia doesn\u2019t want her there. \n\nAgain you are NTA OP.", "I see a lot of adults here seemingly inviting people to their parties that they actually don't like...\r  \n\r  \nOf course, all you need to do is invite people you like to a Christmas party you like. What a BS. NTA, But SIL is.", "INFO: I am confused, Mia will have her party (for which I agree she should invite only whoever she wanted) and at the same day and time you will have your adults only party. Georgia is not invited but you invited your SIL and brother to your party. How did you think this will go? Please correct me if I didn't understand something", "NTA; I for one, support teaching your children that no means no, and that they don\u2019t have to be pressured into doing something they don\u2019t want to do. It sucks her feelings were hurt, but you can\u2019t always get your way.", "NTA, but having a an christmas for just adults and a separate party for children that the people invited to the adult party cannot bring their kids to is obviously recipe for disaster. You couldn't have set this up in a more foolish way if you'd tried.", "NTA \n\nIt's your daughter's party and she wants her friends. Also you SIL tried to bully you into inviting her daughter", "\nTwo separate parties, same location , same day is my understanding.  Last  years step niece invited to kids party and brother/sil invited to adults.\n\nI don\u2019t see an issue with Mia setting her own invite list. The misstep from my perspective is not calling your brother and giving him a heads up. There has been a precedent that Georgia has been invited to the kids party. My child is roughly the same age and remembers things. If this was him he\u2019d ask if the party was happening.  That\u2019s him, he understands that he doesn\u2019t get to go to everything, friend groups change, etc. So anticipating that Georgia would probably find out is realistic. Also, with the parties being the same day, they are probably linked in their minds and think oh we\u2019re family, of course we\u2019lll get invited\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey brother, just want to give you a heads up the invite to our cocktail party are going out this week. This year Mia wants her party to be school friends only and we are supporting her in that decision. Giving you a heads up if she asks you guys about it.  As the girls grow older it\u2019s natural that they\u2019d gravitate to their own friend groups. Hope you\u2019ll be able to make the party\u201d\n\nRelationships change , especially with kids, it\u2019s hard when one of the kids likes hanging out the other more. If SiL perceived it that there were no issues with the kids and you perceived it that Mia doesn\u2019t want to hang to Georgia as much, this was a natural progression for you and maybe for SIL/brother, this feels like it\u2019s coming out of left field.\n\n\nNTA for letting Mia decide her list, but I think you could have managed this better. Especially since this is your brother, think about if they didn\u2019t ask before hand how it would have played out when they showed up and saw the other party. They\u2019d probably have been hurt and if I was them I would think \u201c were family, why wouldn\u2019t you let me know?\u201d\n\nI understand SIl not wanted to come to your party, she may want to do something whrh Georgia the day of your party, but her adding Christmas into the mix is manipulative. \n\nIf it was me, I\u2019d follow up with brother and tell him that you are sorry for not giving them the heads up about MIa\u2019s party. These are 2 seperate parties with different guest lists. Years prior, you worked in the list with Mia more and this year she wanted to set it herself and have it just friends. You agree and support that, but looking back, you\u2019d let them know so if Georgia asked , they\u2019d be able to frame it her.", "NTA. Your SIL isn't in a good position to accuse you of bullying, since she's openly trying to bully an invite for her daughter. It's specifically Mia's party, not an open kids party, so Mia can invite whoever she wants. She doesn't want to deal with her cousin. If because of that your brother & SIL don't feel able to attend your Christmas party, that's fine, they don't have to.", "Quick question, is it just Mia's friends that are going or are there any other kids from your family invited?", "INFO Were brother and SIL coming to the adult Christmas party this year prior to the daughter not being invited to the kid's party?", "By 10 your daughter should get to decide who comes to her party or not. However for me it's how you tried to keep it a secret, because that was only going to end badly. You being the adult and supporting your daughters decision to keep Georgia off the guest list should of called you SIL and brother and had an adult conversation on why she wasn't invited. It was always going to be a hard conversation so instead you decided to hide it. To me that makes you the AH here.\n\nSO YTA, not because Georgia wasn't invited but because of the sneakiness in hiding her not being invited and asking your daughter to be in on the sneakiness.", "Honestly? I'd have Mia throw a party ANY OTHER DAY than this one.\n\nFrom now on, you know it's going to be an issue. If you really feel that Georgia can't be included, it's a lot of turmoil to prove your point. She's been invited the last 2 years -  you're asking your SIL/BIL to literally lie to her (she'll surely ask about this year's party) if she asks.\n\nIt's your choice whether you want to die on this hill. Is it truly going to \"ruin Mia's day\"? Or is reality that Mia would PREFER not to have Georgia, but it's not like the world is coming to an end (even if she's a dramatic tween). Were you ever excluded as a child from someone's party? Is that how you want to treat Georgia?\n\nI also think you need to be honest about how you portray Georgia (*\"she won't accept that Mia doesn't want to play\", \"Georgia wanted to play with Mia more than the other way round\", \"Mia grew out of active games quite young\"*). Your judgement is almost visible from here.\n\nSo, I guess after all that.... yes, gently, YTA", "YTA.", "Jesus people no you don\u2019t have to be around people who you don\u2019t like. Christmas time, Easter, thanksgiving none of that is an excuse to have someone you don\u2019t particularly enjoy having around around. That takes a worse situation and makes it into an even worse situation especially for children.", "NTA for listening to your daughter but it kind of sounds like the OP wants things go her way and is shocked that SIL won't come to the party. No, Mia doesn't have to invite Georgia, but SIL doesn't have to go to OP's party either. If brother and SIL go to the adult party, then I assume Georgia will have to be by herself or with a babysitter. She might have realized at that point either way. OP just needs to understand that standing up for her daughter, which is the right thing to do, is going to hurt some people's feelings. This whole, \"don't tell Georgia about the party\" was a bit unrealistic hope to begin with. She's 11. She isn't going to understand why she was excluded if no one sits down with her and let's her know, and OP needs to understand and accept that there are sometimes consequences we don't like even when we are doing the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nIt's pretty simple. Mias party, Mias guest list.", "NTA\n\nNow we know where Georgia learned to ignore other people\u2019s feelings. SIL has probably told the poor girl to force herself on Mia even when Mia asks to be alone because \u201cshe\u2019s part of the family.\u201d OP should have lied to SIL and said a school friend was having the party.\n\nI understand where people are coming from re: having the parties on different days, but not so much to hide it from Georgia, but to hide it from her mother.", "NTA. Good for you and standing up for your daughters wishes. It\u2019s miserable being around someone you don\u2019t want to be around. Here\u2019s my best example to prove it: \n\nWhen I was growing up I had a childhood best friend and she had a little baby brother. Her little brother was obnoxious, a crybaby, clingy, and cussed like a sailor (their father was a badly behaved man)\u2026 at only about 4 years old. Her parents were always drunk and even when they were home, it seemed like they never wanted to take care of him because he\u2019d be pushed onto us. If we said we didn\u2019t want to play with him, or even tell him that to his face; her and I would get in trouble. I mean, what little girl wants to play with a little baby boy? Let alone her annoying little brother. \n\nSo, without fail, every time for my birthday parties\u2014 something would happen and my party would suddenly become about her baby brother and us having to play with him. We had big swimming parties and a lot of my friends were always there. If he didn\u2019t get enough attention from either his sister or me, he\u2019d have a fucking meltdown. During that time, my parents were too busy partying with their friends to care, but the times they did notice, I wonder if they spoke about it with her parents? Either way, I think a lot of it was a parenting issue and neglect. \n\nAnyways, it\u2019s your daughters party. Don\u2019t let anyone bully you into doing something you or your daughter don\u2019t want to do. Yes, her cousin will probably be sad to hear\u2026 but that\u2019s life and boundaries. Hopefully your brother and sister-in-law will realize one day that your decision makes sense when their daughter says they don\u2019t want to invite a specific kid to her birthday parties. It happens.", "YTA Not because you aren't forcing your daughter to invite someone she doesn't want to her party BUT because you knew you weren't going to extend an invite to their child but invited her parents to a party at the same location at the same time. There was no way this wasn't going to happen the way it did. The only way you could have possibly avoided this was to not invite the entire family but to think you could invite the adults and not the kid to a yearly event and not cause issues is insane.  \n  \n If your daughter was having a stand alone party any other time there's no issues here at all but the fact that it's a dual party means it's one of those occasions where you tell your daughter yes you have to invite her because she's going to come over with her parents anyway and it's polite.", "NTA. It\u2019s Mia\u2019s party and she is not obligated to invite anyone. As some of my cousins and I got older we made our own friends, grew apart, and stopped being invited to one another\u2019s parties. It happens and doesn\u2019t make anyone an AH.", "YTA if Georgia has been over during your adult party time, two years in a row, she will know she is being excluded \n\nWhile I also agree your daughter should not be forced to invite people who are not her \u2018friend\u2019, you are setting yourself up for a no win situation by still having her party on the same day. \n\nGeorgia will know , her parents won\u2019t have to tell her. \n\nSometimes (not always) we have to do things we don\u2019t want to and include people we don\u2019t want to, because it\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nLike in this case, I believe if you plan to hold your tradition, inviting Georgia would be the right thing to do", "YTA - this party is essentially the more elaborate equivalent of having a \u201ckids table\u201d at a family dinner. If this was your daughter having her own party that would be one thing but this is in tandem with yours. \n\nYou\u2019ve invited your cousin and their spouse but youre excluding their kid? Of course you\u2019re going to look like an AH here. Theyre family, albeit step, but have known each other their whole life.", "NAH it is of course fine for the party to exclude people you don\u2019t want to invite, however our actions are not free from consequence and if the people we are excluding are close family members then there will be some upset, especially when children are involved", "INFO: so what you are saying is, the past years they have come to the adult party and their child hasn\u2019t needed a baby sitter because she was at your daughters party? Who was the adult in charge of them?", "More and more in life, I\u2019m seeing this completely selfish, empathy lacking pov become more prevalent and acceptable, and it makes me sad. \n\nThe question is not whether you or Mia have the right to curate your guest list how you want. Yes, everyone has the right to do what they want. But the question is does that make you an asshole? And I\u2019d say it does.\n\nGA knows about the party, her parents know about the party. I think it was an AH move to not even give your SIL a heads up. Speaking as a parent, if I was in SIL\u2019s position, I would have at the very least, appreciated you talking to me about it beforehand. Not having to ask you after the invites were given. That seems like you can\u2019t even acknowledge the fact that you know it\u2019s going to hurt. You treated it as a non issue. And then you doubled down by playing semantics of specifying it was Mia\u2019s party and not a kids\u2019 party. Like, you acted completely ignorant and pretended to not realize what this info meant to them. It would hurt on a SIL level, I would also be hurt for my kid. I would be offended that you invited me without even mentioning my kid, because of how it\u2019s gone the years before. \n\nIf I were you, I would have talked to my kid about the importance of family. I would have stressed that the exclusion would have hurt Georgia. I would have asked how she would have felt if it were the other way around. I would have wanted to teach my daughter the importance of sometimes doing something she didn\u2019t really want to, for the benefit of making someone else feel good. \n\nAre any of you obligated to do this? Absolutely not. But this isn\u2019t \u2018am I obligated?\u2019 It\u2019s AITA. And I do believe YTA.\n\nAnd I also wonder if you would be just as cool with this if Georgia was your bio-niece.", "Mia can invite who she wants yes.\n\nHowever, I feel bad for Georgia. \nCrappy parenting made this so much worse for her. Her spirit probably got more crushed by the way this was handled and is probably not getting to the emotional support needed to be guided through this.  \n\n\"Sorry Mia only invited school friends\" - stings a little.\n\nInstead she got consistent rejection while the parents battled to make their points. \n\nThat rejection is going to run deep.", "Ok so parents will be at your party one floor above the other kids. Kids are not allowed at your party. Niece is not allowed at Mia party. So what is supposed to happen to Niece? Stay home alone, knowing exactly where her parents are and the rest of the family are, but she is not welcome?", "I think there are a lot of variety in the comments because it\u2019s not completely clear about the two parties. A few thoughts about that:\n1)The adult and kids parties are on the same day each year, so people that are aware of both would expect that trend to continue. \n2) even though the parties are separate (different starting times, different themes), it seems like the location - OP\u2019s house is the same for at least part of both parties. \n3) It\u2019s unclear if there are other families besides OP\u2019s and SIL\u2019s that have had family members attend the two parties before.\n\nBecause of #1 and #2, I can definitely see why some responses consider the two parties to be a single party with separate activities for kids. Frankly, whether it\u2019s described as one or two parties, there\u2019s overlap in terms of date, location, and some guest families. Additionally, expectations have been set based on prior year\u2019s invitations. People that have previously been invited to parties multiple times will OF COURSE notice the trend and expect that the parties will happen this year. And even if the people were really oblivious, I\u2019m guessing guests of one party would see signs of the other party happening. \n\nAll this means that there was basically no possible way that the cousin wouldn\u2019t have found out she was being snubbed. YTA", "YTA - you\u2019re giving off mean girl vibes too.", "YTA in blurring the lines of the parties. Mia absolutely does not have to invite anyone she doesn\u2019t want to her party. However, you really made it sound like this was a kids party and adults party but all part of the same event. So for the past 2 years, your SIL\u2019s whole family came to what she saw as one holiday event only now to find out it really isn\u2019t. Yeah, it\u2019s kind of crappy. It all could have been avoided by having Mia\u2019s party on a different day.", "NTA, not a bully.  SIL needs a dictionary.  Needs to read coercion  and then read bully.  SIL is the bully here.  Do not give in to the bully.  Party host and wedding party are always allowed to control guest list.  Nobody is entitled to an invite.  That includes children.", "YTA for trying to make out that these are 2 separate parties, when in reality you are having a party in your house whilst your daughter has a sleepover with her friends upstairs. I understand you respecting your daughter's wishes as to who she wants to invite to \"her party\", however you have created this situation by inviting your SIS/Brother to your party that their child has attended with them in the past. Georgia would know that previous years there has been a sleepover, and therefore now knows that she's been excluded (even if the reasons for doing so are valid from your daughter's POV). These are not 2 separate parties and it's unfair to exclude someone when you have previously set the precedent.", "NTA\n\nSIL wants free babysitting.  It would probably be best to just uninvite SIL from your party.  She's being manipulative and will continue to cause issues.", "I N F O, do any of the other adults at your party have kids, and if so are they invited to mias party?\n\nEdit: then I say NTA, this isn't an event where families are invited and kids go one place with adults elsewhere, the guests lists aren't connected/same", "NTA. When I was younger and had parties my mom forced me to invite kids to them that I wasn\u2019t friends with cause they were her friends kids. Some of them weren\u2019t nice to me either and didn\u2019t invite me to their parties in return. Mia wants to have a fun party with her friends. It sounds like Georgia is clingy to Mia and Mia doesn\u2019t like it. She has every right to set boundaries and tell her mom she doesn\u2019t want her at the party. Georgia wouldn\u2019t have known if her mom hadn\u2019t told her in an attempt to manipulate an invite and now she\u2019s hurt her own daughter\u2019s feelings. Mia is setting boundaries and SIL doesn\u2019t like it.\n\nEdit to add: No one is entitled to an invite, even if they\u2019re family. SIL is teaching Georgia that she\u2019s entitled to an invite even though she\u2019s not wanted.

But with the request for INFO: are there any other cousins who were/were not invited? I'm an only child and remember having parties where my cousins were not invited because I was the only girl in our family for 20+ years and the boys didn't want to do chalk art and nail painting. I was invited to our neighbors birthday party and it was awkward but I chose to go. She turned 5 and I was 8 and her mom didn't want me to feel weird. Incidentally I pinned the tail on that donkey first try because I had great spacial control. \n\nIf Georgia and Mia's personalities are that different (which I suspect they are) Georgia wouldn't have fun anyway and would feel outcasted.

They don't share similar interests right now and Mia feels she's not a friend. This is a normal part of childhood. Her party is just friends from school, not all the cousins except Georgia, so as long as Mia isn't mean to Georgia just because they don't have the same interests, it's not bullying. \n\nYou were an asshole for trying to avoid having the difficult conversation with your SIL. There is no \"picking up hints\". This is your family, Georgia is only 11, and she was invited two years in a row. You were always going to have to tell SIL directly that Mia feels Georgia and her are not close and she just wants school friends at the party, that you understand Georgia may feel hurt but that it's just a painful part of growing up. Mia is 10, Georgia was going to find out she was excluded sooner or later so being so dismissive of how it looks was a mistake. \n\nyour SIL has a right to be hurt on behalf of her daughter and express that she's feeling hurt for Georgia. Georgia may not have a lot of friends at school, and may have thought her and Mia are closer than they are. However, it's one of those times where her and her husband have to talk to Georgia and explain that its a fact of growing up, people grow apart even when they are family. If Georgia does have one or two friends, she should have proposed maybe doing her own pre Christmas celebration just them.  SIL was TA for just blatantly telling her the party is happening, thinking that means she gets to go. It's a missed learning and growing opportunity for her daughter, and frankly a stupid and mean thing to do. \n\nIf you all talk again, I would start by acknowledging that you understand this hurts Georgia's feelings, and that you did not want that for her, but that you want Mia to have the independence of picking her own friends and celebrating with them. Don't just start by saying you did nothing wrong, because you've both handled it poorly.", "NTA. Georgia is not raised well enough to be considerate of others wishes and feelings and Mia does not want her company. Georgia's mom is manipulative and probably the reason why Georgia was raised in such a way to not consider other kids wishes and feelings.", "I am super torn because while I don\u2019t think Mia should have to have her cousin, it seems like the parents assume (Mia\u2019s) it\u2019s just like a babysitting party so kids can come and parents can drink. \n\nI think Georgias parents are jerks for just telling Georgia about the \u201ckids\u201d party when it\u2019s not a kids party. I also think it sucks they are bailing on Christmas over this. \n\nHonestly I think the only way to make this work out in the years going forward is to host the parties on 2 separate nights. So the adults only party is legit adults only with no kids in the home at all. So when asked if there is a kids party you can answer and say nope. Then host Mia\u2019s party another weekend, that way Sil doesn\u2019t feel Georgia has a right to be there. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m going ESH (except poor Georgia who is just being thrown into the middle and all of this, and being used as a pawn by her mom.)", "NTA, but the whole setup was not well-planed. Your daughter absolutely has the right to choose with whom she wants to interact, and it's good that you listen to her wishes... \n\nBut having the two parties at the same day and in the same house is obviously not the smartest choise. Doesn't make you an AH, but these problems could have been at least partially avoided.\n\nRegarding the argument that Georgia will feel excluded... Yeah, that's just how it is.

I suspect generally there isn't much family overlap which makes it a bit easier to keep them distinct. The problem is now you've had overlap previously with your brother and sil at your party and Georgia at Mia's. \n\nI'm not saying invite Georgia, but perhaps moving forward having Mia's party on a different day would be helpful in terms of separating the events and to avoid future backlash.

I understand that she is hurt for her daughter and is reacting emotionally as a result. But, even if she succeeded in forcing an invite, her daughter would be miserable.  An unwanted guest with primarily people she doesn't know? That's a no win for Georgia or SIL. Georgia feels left out either way. All of which could have been avoided if SIL didn't tell Georgia.  Would Mia be resistant to perhaps planning something for her and Georgia to do together on another day, just the 2 of them?", "NTA - To force your daughter to invite someone they don\u2019t get along with and did not want to her party is teaching your daughter to be unhappy in her own world. You do you, and what is right for your child. I also don\u2019t see an issue with you having a party on the same day as your daughter! I think it is a very good idea to teach children these days to socialize and not depend on electronics.  The fact that they told their daughter after they already knew that she was not invited was very vindictive. The whole party would be strained, and uncomfortable for all that attended. I would disinvite them from your party as well.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems that many posters here are thinking that your party is a \"family\" party, under which circumstances, yes, I think you'd be in the wrong for disinviting your niece.  But my reading indicates that what you're ACTUALLY having is a party to which your brother and SIL are invited, while also hosting a sleepover for your daughter and her friends.\n\nI've got a 10 year old daughter myself.  And she comprehends that sometimes she isn't going to get invited to something that she wishes she was.  Because that's life-you don't get to do all of the things that you want to.  Do you know what I DON'T do? I don't force the issue.  She needs to learn that things don't always go her way.\n\nI understand that Mia is possibly outgrowing her \"friendship\" with Georgia.  That happens-it's happening with my daughter and one of her friends right now.  I'm baffled why Georgia can't be told that Mia is hosting her classmates this year; are Georgia's wants more important than Mia's? 10- and 11-year-olds aren't babies.  They are learning to navigate the world and develop the understanding that things aren't always \"fair\". These are necessary emotional skills that come from experiencing frustration and disappointment.  I'd say as long as Mia continues to treat Georgia kindly at actual family events, she's fulfilling her duties as far as being a decent human being is concerned.

OP's brother and SIL have had several years to teach her to leave other people alone if the other people don't want to play. Also, no one is entitled to an invitation even from relatives. \n\nAnother point that is jumping out at me is that SIL seems to see Mia's party as free babysitting while the adults are having another party. SIL doesn't seem to respect Mia except as a playmate for her daughter. All the comments about the adult party and Mia's party are not separate parties are missing the point.

Sometimes that lasts forever, and sometimes we find our way back to similar interests.\n\nBut it isn't mean to not invite someone to a party this year just because you invited them to a party in previous years.\n\nThis is something that Georgia will have to learn; it is a fact of growing up -- otherwise our circles of friends would never change.  If her parent cannot explain that in a way that doesn't harm her, then the parent sucks.", "She seems like she\u2019s old enough to be told the truth though, right? At the end of the day it\u2019s clear that Mia doesn\u2019t want to be friendly with Georgia and that means her not being invited to a party. If Georgia were to ask about it I would be 100% honest and clear with her\u2026Mia hasn\u2019t invited you to her party because she doesn\u2019t want to and doesn\u2019t HAVE to. They aren\u2019t close. They aren\u2019t friends so why does Georgia have to go? It sucks but that\u2019s life.", "If my dislike for them is, \u201cthey\u2019re kind of annoying but otherwise harmless\u201d and inviting them could avoid a family fracture, then yeah, that\u2019s probably worth that small bit of sacrifice.\n\nPeople here act like there\u2019s only one variable at play (one kid who doesn\u2019t like another kid), when family dynamics are never as clean cut as that. \n\nThe two parties are happening at the same time in the same house\u2014Georgia\u2019s parents (along with, I\u2019m assuming, the rest of their relatives) would have been to the one upstairs, while Georgia sat at home by herself. As much as OP is trying to justify how Georgia is \u201cnot being excluded\u201d, she will in fact be the only one of that family who won\u2019t be under OP\u2019s roof celebrating on that given night. If OP is okay with her brother and SIL not coming, and if she\u2019s okay fundamentally changing the basis of how her family interacts with theirs within the broader scope of their extended family unit, then have at it. But she\u2019s at best being disingenuous to insist Georgia won\u2019t have known and will not have had her feelings hurt at being excluded. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have happened the night of the party, but once the holiday season passed, she\u2019ll realize she was never invited to the party she\u2019s historically always gone to. \n\nSIL sucks for obvious reasons.", "Exactly!\n\nThe parents could have gotten a babysitter since the party was adults only and told their daughter they were going out and never mentioned the parties and Georgia would not have known.", "Naah, this would only be acceptable if she hadn\u2019t been invited prior years or if the kids party was on a totally different day/time/place as the adult party.  The in-laws even asked if there would be a kids version party like the previous years\u2026 C\u2019mon guys, that\u2019s just mean. \n\nIf it was OP\u2019s kid\u2019s birthday party, or something that\u2019s a different story, but an 10 year old doesn\u2019t need to hold a xmas party, and the two parties are kinda linked at this point.", "What?? B/c their kids are invited\u2026", "What does it matter?? If the two parties don\u2019t interact, then they\u2019re separate.", "Sorry, I thought it was obvious since I said they were having a sleepover. My bad.", "I think most people would consider a kids party in this context to be a babysitting service. That\u2019s not unreasonable.\n\nIf OP wants to be all about his kid\u2019s social autonomy, don\u2019t make her party at the same time and place as the adults-only adult party. Like I know it\u2019s a big thing on this website to rag on \u201centitled parents,\u201d but come *on*, OP is being really obtuse. And honestly, he\u2019s putting his *own* kid in a shitty position.", "Yeah im torn on this one. I totally understand why Georgias parents would be upset. Sounds like Georgia is more into Mia too, so it totally must have hurt her feelings. What parents would not feel bad about that", "If the children at Mia\u2019s party are (at least for the most part) not the children of the adults at OP\u2019s party then yes they do sound like they are separate parties. That\u2019s a really different situation than inviting adults with their own children and then hosting the children downstairs", "They're 10, with a houseful of adults up a flight of stairs.  They don't need babysitters.", "THAT part. It\u2019s not that she had to be invited. But it\u2019s super obtuse to think that she wouldn\u2019t think about a if a kids party that she participated in the previous two years during the adult party her parents went too, was happening again during an adult party that her parents were again going too. Especially since it\u2019s in the same house.", "Valid question", "I should have, I see that now, for sure.\n\nGeorgia was the only child who ever had parents attending, even last year.", "But at the same time, you\u2019re raising your kid to push someone else\u2019s boundaries. We had a kid just like Georgia in our extended family. His parents were family friends and they always brought him around. And he was so annoying. He made us share everything we had with him, he would cry to his parents if we said we didn\u2019t want to play, and he was very rude. It sounds like her kid is fed up and doesn\u2019t want her at the party. No one teaches their kids that not everyone wants to be friends. \n\nI would\u2019ve told my kid \u201chey, Mia is only inviting kids from school this year. But we\u2019ll have a movie night and eat snacks and order pizza.\u201d", "Oh no, she's in the shit position of having to parent her child. How terrible. \ud83d\ude44", "THIS! Im wondering if OP talked this through with her daughter? Like, ok you dont want to invite her why is that? How do you think that will make her feel? Etc. Children dont always think that far ahead, and its important to teach them how their actions will affect others. Its not like shes forcing her to do, she just making her think about it.", "I totally agree. And the way she is arguing here in the comments and what her arguments are makes it clear she never would even entertain the idea that she was the AH, she just wanted to come here to confirm she was right. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if OP was right or not, but Op has to be delusional if she is surprised that this was a possible outcome. Like is it all that shocking that her SIL is upset her kid wasn\u2019t included? And not everyone will take \u201cdifferent floors\u201d as a totally separate event, since it\u2019s the same house and time", "And it sounds like the only reason they don\u2019t want to invite the cousin is because she didn\u2019t outgrow playing like OP\u2019s 10 y/o daughter did. I get kind of a mean-girl-in-training vibe.", "Maybe, maybe not.  The only reason she knows now is because (probably) SIL told her about it.\n\nThis could have been handled so smoothly.\n\n\"Your cousin Mia is turning X age this year and is no longer doing what she used to do.  Why don't you see if friend X will have you over for the night your dad and I are going to the adults only cocktail party?\"", "The adult party happens to take place while Mia's party is going on, but Mia's party starts hours earlier than\nOP's and is a sleepover that doesn't end until the next day.\n\nIt's not the same as if Mia's friends arrived at the same time as OP's guests and left at the same time as well.", "By that logic, a restaurant/venue that\u2019s hosting 2 weddings at the same time (or 1 wedding, 1 birthday) is really hosting 1 giant event? You can have 2 separate parties happening at the same time, at the same location.\n\nThe only people that\u2019s related between the 2 parties is OP and OP\u2019s kid, both of whom are hosting their events on the same day at their home. To me, those are separate events.", "I understand they\u2019re happening in the same house, my understanding that the bulk of the kids party was during the \u201cday\u201d before the adult party even started. If I misunderstood, that\u2019s obviously fine, but I wouldn\u2019t consider those events to be two joint parties regardless.", "The 10yo is controlling the list of her own party. By this logic, should parents of the kids coming to Mia's party be upset that they are not invited to the adult party because \"it's happening at the same time\"?", "I wouldn't say harassed, she just gets pushy. She'll ask constantly after Mia has said no, try bargaining with her to get her to play etc. I wouldn't call it bullying, it's just a lack of understanding boundaries I guess.", "Drinks, yes. People becoming obviously intoxicated have to leave. I have enough trauma from people who can't handle their drink, and I will not have drunk people in my house.", "Right? Since when is having boundaries and not immediately bending them to boundary stompers in any way \u201cmean girl\u201d behavior? The only mean girl here is the sister who intentionally told her daughter she wasn\u2019t invited so she could weaponize her pain in a sad attempt to force an invite.", "She's raising a mini me. This isn't a birthday party. This is a select Christmas party she's having. Just like Mom.", "It's a movie night and sleepover. Downstairs.", "THANK YOU!!!!! In ten years they'd be on here calling Georgia entitled for being mad she wasn't invited. This is exactly how entitlement grows. She's 11, she's old enough to learn better.", "No. You cant force people into relationships. But you can be civil. Which is it's even more bewildering that OP is confused as to why the mother of the child being excluded is now refusing a relationship.", "Just because she was invited previously doesn't entitle her to being invited now. The kids' party isn't a family party; OP was right to let her daughter choose who she wanted to invite instead of forcing her to invite someone she's not friends with.", "Because Georgia had been invited other years and OP thought Brother and SIL \u2026 just wouldnt notice there was another party happening downstairs that their daughter was now excluded from", "So its the same party and the kids just go play downstairs.", "OP, I'm all for kids autonomy, but come on. You know you have created a situation here where there would only be hurt feelings within your family. You know that. I know that. There is this oush these days to ensure our children are heard and validated, but many times that can also be at the expense of excluding others just because our kid is mean? Now I am not saying your Mia is mean. I'm not. And she can pick who she wants to have over for her parties and sleep overs. But when you invite family over and exclude their children at the other party, you know what this is going to do. Yeah, great. You want Mia to have a party SHE wants - well then teach her a lesson here: there are times to be self-centered and there are times we bite the bullet and be gracious. Mia can a have  an \"Only Mia friends party\" on nights when you are not inviting family over. And yes, I get it. its not just a family thing; but people don't stop being your family. You have created a rift here in your family. You have. And while it is no one's \"fault\", you are teaching a lesson here to these two girls that will carry with them for the rest of their lives and will spill over into your relationships with your own family. I would also spend some time considering WHY bullying these days are so pervasive. is it because we have been allowing our children to exclude others that they don't absolutely ADORE every single moment of every single day of their entire lives because it is their choice? And how will that message carry over into adulthood? What future effects will this have on your child? On your niece? There are levels of relationships, and you just told your whole family whose yours and your daughter's is. So slight YTA.", "It doesn't sound like any of the other guests to the adult party have their children at Mia's party. so no, it does not. Mia's friends are at her function, which *happened* to include her step-cousin last two years but doesn't this year.", "So you think that the 11 year old should have to babysit any kids the adult guests want to drop off with Mia? \n\nGeorgia was included for 2 years due to close age and likely in an attempt to bond with the in-laws but the girls seem to have nothing in common so Georgia herself shouldn\u2019t want to go anyway to a party where all other girls are friends and she\u2019s the odd girl out.\n\nThat\u2019s not OP & Mia being mean or bullies. It\u2019s wanting to enjoy a drama-free evening.", "Not really, though. It's just a bigger guest list. Mia has guests. OP (and partner?) has guests.

Its the same party and the kids are just downstairs.", "I suspect her mother has encouraged this (yes, I realize OP said that SIL tells Georgia to leave Mia alone, but look how boundary stopping SIL was here, I do not entirely believe SIL is reinforcing respect of boundaries when other people are not watching). Seriously, your SIL doesn\u2019t respect boundaries and uses Georgia\u2019s feelings as a weapon-ex: why did she tell Georgia about the party? Did it never occur to her that if her manipulation failed to work, Georgia would be the one who was hurt? It is irrelevant that she blames OP/Mia, her daughter never needed to know about this rejection and now she does.", "This party sounds like itll be a blast, can I get an invite?", "Exactly! The sisters the only AH here, subjecting her daughter to that.

I think you\u2019re projecting more than anything", "Except it sounds like the kids who are invited to the kid party are Mia\u2019s friends from school so it\u2019s not the kids in attendance are the children of the adults at the party.

It's not an \"everyone who's invited can bring their kids and there will be activities for them\", that's what makes it a separate party.", "Why is this so hard for you guys to understand.\n\nThey are separate parties.

We only knew because of the gazillion cars parked outside. \n\nIf the adult party were at a different house or if it were on another day, SIL and BIL will need to get a babysitter for Georgia anyway so the point of having to bring Georgia as a necessity/obligation is moot. Also, OP\u2019s adult party probably has parents who do not have kids invited to Mia\u2019s party and they probably got their own babysitters. SIL is simply being entitled and teaching Georgia to be one as well. \n\nI agree with OP setting boundaries for Mia. It is a party that Mia deserved to enjoy. Now that feelings are inevitably hurt, perhaps OP can suggest to Mia that she and Georgia can have a cousin\u2019s day where they go out and do fun stuff - just the two of them. It might be a good lesson for kindness and acceptance and it might even help with them bonding better instead of forcing Georgia to fit into a party with people she doesn\u2019t know. \n\nAnd what is up with the mom - saying that Georgia should be invited and she\u2019ll leave early because she\u2019ll have a terrible time anyway?

And sometimes that means we grow apart from other people. And that's OK. \n\nJust because her mom married into the family does not obligate others to include her in their lives. \nThis will not be the last time she gets excluded because of her big personality. \n\nShe's gonna have to learn to be happy with herself and that will attract people who will love her personality.

So that means that Georgia\u2019s parents had to find a babysitter for her. And kids naturally ask when their parents go out without them where they are going. Of course Georgia would find out, because why make her parents lie to her about it? And she\u2019s been at Mia\u2019s party before that occurred at the same time, it\u2019s not like a party like that happens every year is going to be forgotten by a kid that age. We aren\u2019t talking about toddlers.\n\nI mean, I get that Mia should have people she likes at her party, but the situation is, her party happens at the same time as the adult party so that YOU don\u2019t have to deal with what to do with your kid while the adult party is happening. You invite her parents to your party and their kid is\u2026 on her own. And she is family\u2026       \nOk let\u2019s switch this around, OP. What if it were you being invited to an adult party by a relative and your daughter was not invited to a party happening for kids at the same time. Your daughter\u2019s cousin doesn\u2019t invite your daughter. You are left having to somehow lie about it when the babysitter arrives to your daughter, to spare her feelings. You then ask yourself, why are you having to lie about it like this? And then attend a party held by relatives who treat your daughter as the persona non grata.  Let\u2019s be real here for a moment. The timing of your daughter\u2019s party is to keep her out of the way at YOUR party. If you wanted her to have her own party, cool.

Maybe ask Mia if they could have a special cousins date, something that the two girls can do together, I get they are on different levels maturity wise, but having to much family who loves and want to spend time with you isn\u2019t a bad problem too have.

I wonder if she actually asked Georgia if she wanted to come before making a big fuss, or if she even knows that the party will involve stuff her daughter probably won\u2019t have fun doing. SIL seems like the type to use her child to make a point, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing here.

While that's great for Georgia, it's not so much for Mia.\n\n I agree with others that maybe there could have been a compromise where Mia gets her friend party on a different night and spends time with just Georgia during the adult party. The fact that she has to choose whether or not to incorporate her estranged cousin into her friend group for one night forces the issue. No kid would choose to do that if given the option not to. Framing it as a \"why not both?\" situation sets some clear boundaries and helps the cousins get along without forcing anything.\n\nThat said, Georgia's mom could be spending all that time and energy getting her daughter into activities so she could make friends of her own. I'm saying this as a mom of a kid on the autism spectrum. It's hard as hell. But you should never force your kid on anyone, just kept trying to encourage them to find their own tribe. The pain she feels for her daughter is just as valid as OP's defense of their daughter. However the SIL forcing OP's hand by telling Georgia about the party only hurts Georgia. I also don't get why OP told their kid they couldn't talk about the party, just to turn around and tell Georgia's mom about it.

I also would have separated the adult and kids parties so Mia\u2019s would look like a new and different party and maybe then even have the cover of saying it is a much smaller friend event to lessen potential hurt feelings.

Tradition doesn't mean everyone always gets an invite. There will be shifts in dynamics and if Mia doesn't like being around her cousin, forcing the 2 to interact isn't fair. Georgia has the potential to ruin Mia's night, making it hard to enjoy her party for the sake of appeasing another kid. Why? That's not fair for Mia. Georgia clearly has boundary issues.

That way, Mia gets her private party with friends, and can also hang out just her and Georgia the night of the adult only party.\n\n I assumed from OPs description that Mia doesn't mind hanging out with Georgia sometimes (they said as much) but prefers not to mix her in with school friends, which is totally valid. It takes the pressure off the kid to choose between what she wants and what her cousin wants while still maintaining boundaries. \n\nAnyway it's just what I would do. I think the adults in this situation are behaving way worse than either child.", "Yeah, it's a complicated situation that's difficult to judge without knowing the people involved. It sounds like Georgia hasn't learned how to respect Mia declining her requests to play, so it's understandable Mia wouldn't want her at her party if these were recent occurrences. But that obviously couldn't be done without hurting Georgia's feelings (OP is being incredibly dense to pretend otherwise), so of course Georgia's mother is going to want to shield her daughter from that pain and be upset that her own family doing the excluding. She was wrong to try to weaponize her daughter's feelings in order to strongarm OP into inviting Georgia. OP needs to look out for her own daughter, too, but the fact she's being so dense and doing mental gymnastics to avoid acknowledging this will be hurtful for niece isn't making her look great either.", "OP didn't call it the 'kid party', the SIL did, and OP corrected her that it was Mia's party. It sounds like Mia and Georgia are the only two cousins around the same age in the family, because OP said no other family members would be at Mia's party, just her school friends. It's very understandable why the SIL viewed it as the kid party, though, and OP is being very dense by insisting these parties are two completely separate events. \n\nAnd yes, in retrospect, it would have been a much better idea if the parties were held on separate days. The problem is that because they were essentially the same party, separating them now won't change the fact that the family and Georgia are aware that her cousin has had a Christmas party she's attended in the past, so there's no hiding the awareness that she's been excluded. To illustrate:\n\nSIL: *gets invite to adult Christmas party* is there a kid party?\nOP: It's actually Mia's party, and it'll be held on another day.\nSIL: Okay, so, uh...when should I bring Georgia?\nOP: Mia didn't invite her...\n*awkwardness ensues*", "Or, contrarywise, you (as the parent) just don't mention the party to Georgia and if she asks about it, you just say \"I don't know if Mia is having a party this year. We haven't received an invitation, so maybe not\" and just move on. Eventually Georgia may find out about it, but that's an opportunity for her mother to teach her about boundaries and how it's OK to not be included in everything and how to manage disappointment.", "So OP should force Mia to include someone she isn't close with and doesn't want at her friends sleepover because.... why? None of Mia's friends' parents will be at the adult cocktail party, and none of the kids of the adults attending the cocktail party will be at Mia's.

Georgia is literally the only child with parents at the adult party.", "The only overlap has ever been Georgia.

None of the other adults have kids coming.", "I admit I may be biased because of her obv. sneering at G not having \"grown out\" of being active", "Yes, it would change things.

Did Georgia's parents actually, you know, parent her?  Did THEY tell her to leave Mia alone?  Or did OP have to do that?

OP is teaching her daughter how to set boundaries, then respecting those boundaries set.

If MIA was really having \"her\" own party, it should be on a different day.\n\nAlso, why did SIL have to call after invites were sent, from her perspective she brings her family once a year to a family members christmas party -why would she assume this year is different.

Yeah, kids are allowed to not like other kids and to exclude them, but let's not pretend that's always a great thing to do because \"boundaries.\" None of the adults handled the situation well, but the parents attending this party and leaving Georgia behind with a \"sorry your cousin doesn't like you, have fun while we're at her house!\" would be very cruel for the parents to do. It honestly sounds like it's what OP expected though. Social exclusion hurts, which is why it's used as a punishment in so many societies. \n\nA child deciding she doesn't want to be friends with someone anymore is one thing, but this is her cousin. Usually when one child excludes another, those kids don't have to be near each other at family events going forward. If there were behavior problems those need to be addressed, and could be separately from the party, but these are still young kids. I doubt Mia always behaves perfectly either at this age. It sounds like OP is being deliberately obtuse about the ramifications of excluding her niece, probably because she also doesn't like her much.", "So let me get this straight, in order to not be an asshole, OP would have to ignore his daughter's wishes and force her to invite someone who she doesn't consider a friend?

My mom and her friend forced me and her friends daughter to hang out whenever they did. I was a couple years younger than the other girl. This resulted in relentless bullying from that girl and her friends. At one point they were going to the park in the neighborhood and our parents made her and her friends take me. I was 8 or 9 at the time. I didn't know the neighborhood at all. The girl and her friend used that against me and said let's race. They ran ahead of me and I tried to follow.

You've had dual Christmas parties in your home for the last two years where your SIL and Brother are upstairs and Georgia at the kid's party is downstairs.

How you went about this was more about avoiding conflict until the last moment when it was fait accompli and you are only fooling yourself but fooling no one else when you start your reasoning of \"sparing feelings\".   \n\n\nIt does sound like Georgia needs to work on respecting boundaries and that's not unexpected in an 11 year old.. Which is why it was super important to have that discussion with Bro and SIL so that Georgia could be let down easy. That her being not invited this year is because of her pushy behavior with Mia. I am just really surprised and confused about this route you took to not address the issue at all.  \n\n\nI think that SIL trying to force your hand to change Mia's mind was definitely wrong. As I imagine myself in SIL's shoes, I would not have done that. I would have cut you off however as your decisions and actions were incredibly disrespectful.", "Same! Being excluded to your face (and behind your back) FOR HOURS is much worse than simply not getting invited in the first place, bad as that may be.", "I feel like something must\u2019ve gone on between OP and SIL too because SIL called OP a bully as well, we need more context for that.", "I would have concerns as a parent about sending my kid to a sleepover where the other half of the house is a bunch of strangers drinking.", "So we're going to put Georgia's feelings over Mia's?\n\nWe're going to teach Georgia that even if she isn't wanted somewhere, that bullying and manipulation is a way to get what you want? That shoehorning yourself in to situations that you aren't invited to is good behavior? We're going to teach Mia that she has no agency over who she associates with?

In my first year of middle school my best friends from elementary had one of the sort of \"lead\" girls tell me that we were too different and they didn't want to be my friend anymore. I really internalized this and have had trouble keeping friends ever since in fear that they too would break off our friendship. \n\nNow I finally see what those girls meant. I didn't become interested in typical girly girl things until my university years and even then I was still more inclined to do less girly things like hiking in the mud and spending sleepovers drinking beer watching horror movies. (Stereotypical girliness and non-girliness is what I am referring to.) \n\nThinking back to my time spent with these girls, I now remember not having much fun. I didn't want to do the things they wanted to do like makeup or meeting up with cute boys at a sleepover. In my young opinion, sleepovers were meant to be chaotic pj parties - no boys allowed!\n\nThank you for helping me realize that these girls probably saw our differences and realized our friendship was not benefitting any of us.\n\nEdit: a typo", "I have friendships like that. \nWe are good friends, love to hang out and talk one on one, but usually we won't invite each other to parties or to group hang outs, bec\u00faase we know it won't be each other vibe.", "I agree.

The adult guests may know there are some kids having a good time somewhere else in the house, but I can't imagine they care, except for Georgia's parents, and it's sad she and Mia don't get along, but forcing her to go to Mia's party would make everybody miserable.", ">Sooooo, y\u2019all are having a drinking party and having a kid party too? That sounds smart. \n\nIt's been established that there will be a babysitter overseeing Mia's party.\n\n>And How caring of you to invite your brother, his wife and also their child in years past. Now you will just invite your brother and his wife, but their daughter is out.\n\nYes, in the past the adults were invited to the adult party and their daughter was invited to Mia's party. They aren't friends though, so she is no longer invited to Mia's party. Her parents are still close with Mia's parents, so they are still invited to the adult party. See how that works?\n\n>On top of excluding your niece,\n\nStep-niece. She's OP's brother's step-daughter. Where is her father? Why can't she spend the night with him?\n\n> You expected your brother to continue your subterfuge, lie to his daughter, and exclude his daughter \n\nOr, ya know, just say \"mommy and stepdaddy are going out tonight. Nancy will be babysitting. We'll be back late. Please behave.\" She doesn't need to know everything her parents are doing and not mentioning it is not a lie since a 10 year old child is not entitled to every piece of information her parents have.\n\n>in his own home. \n\nNot in his own home. The parties are at OP's house, not the brother and SIL's house.\n\n>How do you not see this and how unrealistic and unreasonable this is?\n\nIt would've been pretty realistic if SIL wasn't hugely entitled and pushy.\n\n>OP, ask yourself why you simply did not drop your brother and entire family from the invite. Would your brother have been upset, hurt, felt excluded? Now consider the fact he is an adult. You did this to a child.\n\nIt would be a bigger deal to exclude OP's brother and his wife, considering they ACTUALLY have a relationship with them and they would also wonder why they were left out but there would be no good reason. \"Well we wanted to exclude your daughter/step-daughter but we didn't want her to feel bad so we just excluded you too.\" No! The explanation of \"you're invited because we're close but Georgia isn't invited because she and Mia aren't close makes WAY more sense!\n\nThe fact that someone would be hurt for being excluded is not the point. Hurt and disappointment happen - that doesn't mean you are entitled to something you want just because you'd be upset if you didn't get it. A 10 year old is old enough to learn that. What is important is that the brother has a relationship with OP while Mia does not have one with Georgia.\n\n>Also stop acting like your kid controls everything and You never tell her what to do, teach her proper manners, or even social expectations\u2026\u2026\n\nOP isn't acting like their kid controls everything. They're respecting their daughters wishes and teaching her that her boundaries are important and worth enforcing. Not inviting someone you don't like to a party you are having is not bad manners and a lot of social expectations are horseshit meant to pressure people into doing things they don't want to do to make someone else happy at the expense of themselves. There's a big difference between \"you are socially obligated to be there for your friend when they are in need if you want to maintain this friendship\" and \"you have to invite your step-cousin who you don't like, lest her feelings be hurt.\" Georgia can live with some hurt feelings and she will get over them.\n\n>Might have been nice to tell your daughter that exclusion hurts. Might have been nice to explain, between moms, why your daughter has a problem with her daughter. Using your words is a better way to express feelings and establish boundaries.\n\nExclusion DOES hurt. Doesn't mean it's always wrong. Again, Georgia will survive some hurt feelings and move on from them and maybe even learn something. And where are you getting the idea that OP DIDN'T talk to SIL about why Mia doesn't get along with Georgia?\n\n>WTG, OP, you\u2019ve given them something to talk about. You created a rift in your extended family. Shame on you for hurting your niece. Oops, your step-niece. Yeah, I got the part where you tried to diminish your connection.\n\nOP didn't create a rift in their extended family. SIL is doing that by pushing, blackmailing, being shady, name-calling, etc. She's an adult. She should be able to wrap her head around the fact that the two girls don't get along and that her daughter is not entitled to everything she might want. She should've also understood that, by telling Georgia about the party to try and guilt OP into forcing Mia to invite her, SHE is the one responsible for Georgia's hurt feelings.\n\n>OP, best wishes for your edification and evolution. Please do better. Your daughter needs you to be better.\n\nThis is self-righteous and obnoxious. You are not better than OP just because she made different decisions than you.

Or homeschool. Maybe I'll just get more cats.", "There are many stories of people being forced to hang out with a kid they don't like because their parents are close, almost as if making their kids friends just like them is a fantasy they want to fulfill when they just don't get along right .", "Yes - the part about managing expectations and learning boundaries is so important. OP wasn't great at handling how the invites went but ultimately it's Georgia's parents who are responsible for communicating that not everyone is invited to parties.", "Seems easier to just accept SIL uninviting herself since they are the only adults in the party who got to bring their kid along. Mia doesn't want to hang out with Georgia, SIL doesn't want to hang out with OP. Everyone wins. Changing plans to have Mias party on another day won't change that, SIL will still know her daughter is excluded.\n\nOnly mistake I think OP made was how she went about communicating the issue. It was probably always going to end the same way though.", "I did not mean to imply that I think OP has the responsibility of shepherding other adults' feelings - let alone shouldering the burden of those feelings. That's all. Its not a lie. Its just not SIL's business.\n\nIts explainable certainly: *I encouraged Georgia to manage her party. So, she contacted guests and made her reservations. I'm please she's old mature enough to manage details. Its been an object lesson exercise and she's responded to the task beautifully.*\n\nAnd turn the page.

But it's kind of a jerk move to have the party on a day when the excluded child's parents will undoubtedly discover that exclusion.   \n\n\nThis is about tact, compassion, and dignity. Your daughter doesn't have to invite a non-friend, especially one who makes her uncomfortable. And, yes, your SIL was out of line trying to force an invite, and the way she went about it was presumptuous and immature. But I get it. She felt insulted on her daughter's behalf, and her heart probably hurt for her child. That could have been avoided. Move the daughter's party, don't mention it to family.", "ESH. I think it's fine that Mia didn't want Georgia at her party. However, you've now essentially established a tradition where you host an annual cocktail party with childcare, so it was inevitable that Georgia would find out and feel excluded. When your SIL found out, she had the option of accepting it or bowing out, and instead she pushed you on it, which puts her in AH territory for me.\n\nAlso I've never heard of step-cousins or step-nieces. When do they get to be simply cousins or nieces?", "I think it's fine on excluding the cousin if your daughter doesn't feel comfortable but how you went about it makes you the AH. Basically insinuating that your brother and SIL need to lie to their daughter because it's not like she will know there will be a party even tho the PAST 2 YEARS there have been to her. So what happens when she asks her parents when they go to the adult party if there is a kids party this year. Are they supposed to say lie? You aren't intentionally hurting someone but the parents are given one solution, lie to their kid so you are putting them in a bad spot. \n\nThe only other route is to tell her Mia doesn't want her there which will definitely hurt her feelings. I mean you are teaching your daughter a lesson but is it really a lesson to teach her to not include Georgia and then when she sees her on Xmas pretend to her cousin that she didn't have a party? What if her cousin asks her if she had a party this year? Is your daughter going to lie? So basically a lot of lying is resulting here to teach your daughter a lesson. Why not be honest and have her communicate this stuff. \n\nMaybe teach them at an early age how to communicate this and not just lie to the person? I mean I'm not saying family has to spend time with family just because but Georgia has feelings too and it seems like you literally don't care about her feelings in a way (esp when you put step niece and step cousin instead of niece and cousin I could tell how you feel about Georgia and your relationship with your SIL).  I think this actually could be a teachable moment but whatever relationship with your SIL you have, seems like it's getting in the way of handling tricky situations. YTA for how you are teaching this moment, I feel like there is more nuance here than everyone is narrowing it down to a simple black and white scenario.", "YTA for the way you handled it.  I agree that your daughter should choose, but you should have called your brother & spoke to him about it & told him that they don't have to come to party either.  I don't believe in forcing kids to invite whole class or, in your case, unwanted cousin.  But because it was family it was bound to be sensitive & you went about it in a cold insensitive manner.  Think if the tables were turned.  Even if you wouldn't insist on an invite, you would feel insulted & hurt on your daughter's behalf.  A little bit of empathy could have gone a long way.  Treat people the way you'd want your daughter treated.  With kindness and empathy.", "I'm going against the tide here and saying YTA.\n\nYou don't treat family this way unless they are abusive or something like that.\n\nYou invited Georgia's parents, but not their kid?  And then you expect them to not tell their own kid where they are going, when she knows she has gone in the past?  You are very dense and any family conflict out of this is on your shoulders.\n\nBasically, you have torpedoed your relationship with them.  Maybe you don't care, but the rest of your family will know this drama.\n\nLike others have said, if you really wanted to not invite Georgia, then you should have done it on another day and not mentioned it.", "YTA. Of course you and your daughter have the right to curate your guest lists however you please, but the way you went about it is what makes you an AH. These two parties have happened in tandem for the last few years, and judging by the way your SIL asked about it, they\u2019re seen as a joint matter by other folks. To invite her and not even acknowledge that her daughter is being excluded from an event she\u2019s been welcome to for multiple years prior is an AH move. I can understand why your SIL is so incensed. If y\u2019all have at least a decent relationship, you should\u2019ve spoken to her and your brother about Georgia not being included and why. \n\nTrying to be sneaky and act as though you know this won\u2019t hurt the child\u2019s feelings is assholish, to put it simply. Kids aren\u2019t stupid. You think she wouldn\u2019t have heard about the party at any point in the future? Does she not know any other partygoer? Did you expect her parents to lie for you? This is your family, not friends. These people will always be in your life unless you choose to go NC. Why would you even think trying to hide this would work? Your SIL was right, this is bully behavior. YTA, OP.", "When I was little I did NOT get along with one of my cousins. Like there was an instance where her and I literally threw eachother down the stairs at like 7/8 years old because we hated eachother. Our parents saw that and you know what? They didn't force us to be best friends. I wasn't invited to her parties and she wasn't invited to mine. Now, all these years later, her and I have a wonderfully close relationship. She loves me and I love her. It pays to listen to your kids and respect their wishes. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA but also YTA. I applaud you for sticking up for your daughter! I had situations like this as a kid and it caused so much drama and embarrassment at my slumber parties that I stopped having them. Your daughter has every right to choose to invite. SIL was the one bullying you and is the one who hurt her own daughters feelings by telling her to get you to feel guilty. I get why she\u2019s hurt but it\u2019s a sucky situation either way and you chose to have your daughters back, which was the right choice.\n\nHowever\u2026 I do agree that having the parties on the same night insinuates that it is in fact a kids party for the adults that attend to bring their kids to. So YTA for creating that awkwardness.", "YTA... Does the party come stocked with the Xmas book on \"Learn to be an Entitled Mean Girl.\" Only think of yourself at Xmas... thats the spirit... total AH.", "YTA you\u2019re teaching your daughter to be unkind to family. This isn\u2019t excluding a bully or a random child from your daughter\u2019s class, this is excluding family because they are slightly annoying. You would be very upset if this was the other way around with Georgia having a party every year and then suddenly no longer inviting Mia and your brother still expecting you to come to the adult party like your daughter was not slighted. You don\u2019t treat family that haven\u2019t done anything wrong to you like this.", "YTA.

That said, I wouldn't go to your party either.

You are literally celebrating Christmas which centers around family and loved ones and goodwill towards others- and you're going out of your way to exclude a child, your brother's 11 year old little girl, while fully expecting him and his wife to attend on the adult side.. I feel bad for Georgia too because she didn't even really do anything wrong other than apparently want to play with your kid more than your kid wants to play with her- sounds like maybe she just doesn't have as many friends and felt safe around your daughter since she's familiar with her. I think ideally you should have done the parties on different days, it would have been basically impossible for them to not find out you were excluding their daughter because it's the same day/place", "YTA. Your daughter has every right to have a party without this girl, but you should not hold it on the same night as your adult party which your SIL is coming to. Of course she'll be upset. She'll be forced to watch the party that excluded her kid. And when she leaves the kid at home, what is she supposed to do, lie about where she's going?

As soon as Mia said she didn't want to invite Georgia, OP should have realized something was going on with the kids and reached out to their family. It would have been a *very* different conversation if it started with:\n> \"hey brother and SIL, I wanted to reach out to talk about the girls' relationship with each other. Mia has specifically asked to not be forced to invite Mia, and I want to make sure that this is just about Mia wanting to invite close friends only, and not an actual conflict between them.

I can't imagine going to a party when my kid had previously been invited and then being told I was still welcome but they weren't. You can teach your kids that not everyone will like them, but you shouldn't be close with people who don't like and exclude your child, in my opinion.", "Or another publication where OP was the asshole because the right thing to do was to sit on the floor with more than 10 people, trying to avoid the labrador from her SIL, because telling she that her house was too small to make Christmas dinner would hurt her feelings.", "It's almost like Georgia gets her inappropriate pushiness from somewhere.

Now SIL is in a position to either explain the situation or lie to her daughter. This is not to say that you are in the wrong to allow Mia to invite who she wants. I think you are correct.

I also wonder how the whole topic of not inviting Georgia came up. It kind of sounds like OP introduced the idea of not inviting Georgia, not Mia, but it isn't clear, or perhaps OP only mentioned it because Mia expressed disinterest in having Georgia at previous events.\n\nI'm curious what the ages of the girls were when Georgia had to be told to stop, and how often it occurred. If Georgia was 7 or 8 the last time it happened, kids undergo so much development, especially socially, over a few years that it's hard to hold that against her now. It's a bigger problem if it happened this year. It also could be the case that Mia has superior social skills in comparison to Georgia, and Mia could be giving social cues that most would understand mean no without directly saying it, and Georgia isn't picking them up. That's at least a communication problem that could be solved and not an issue of Georgia refusing to respect people's boundaries.", ">Agreed.

That suggests that perhaps OP isn't so much a concerned parent wanting her daughter's boundaries to be respected and rather that OP has a history of  being a \"mean girl\" who's now teaching her daughter this behavior and exaggerating a past issue to justify  it.\n\nThe way these things go, though, it seems equally likely that SIL is the type to call someone else a bully for simply drawing a boundary, you know?  \n\nThe fact that SIL purposefully told her kid that there \\*would\\* be a kids party, in order to try to force OP's hand, is manipulative.  And then, SIL trying to weaponize the rest of the family, by saying they won't attend any other family holiday gatherings at other houses, if OP and family will be there... that's really manipulative as well.   (Telling grandparents to choose between which grandkids they'll get to see, unless they put pressure on OP?)\n\nFinally, I do note that OP is framing this entire thing as her wanting to respect Mia's choice on who to invite.  Normally, we'd say that was a good thing.  But I notice that in this recounting, the SIL was repeatedly trying to tell \\*OP\\* to change \\*her\\* mind and invite Georgia.  It sounded like SIL wasn't listening and was dismissing the idea that you could want to respect your kid's choices on who to have at their party.  \n\nAnd like, sure, OP \\*could\\* overrule her daughter on this.  A lot of parents would expect that she should.  OP doesn't want to do that to her daughter, and again, normally we'd say that was a good thing (supporting your kid when they say no, especially when it comes to forced interactions with someone else, even family).\n\nThat's why I was wondering about any past incidents with Georgia, and whether OP was the one having to intervene, and whether SIL even noticed a problem or would have done anything about it.  We're just left to assume a lot, here.\n\nIt's the actions of the SIL, trying to manipulate both OP and others in the family, that make me think that SIL calling OP a bully is projection, more than truth.   AND that makes me think that SIL isn't parenting Georgia very well.\n\nWhich honestly is sad for Georgia.  If she is having some struggles with developing social skills, or if she has trouble reading social cues, it's not helping her if her parent isn't trying to help her learn.  BUT, we don't for sure know that that's the case (that her parents aren't trying to help her). \n\nThe thing is that if the problem has been Georgia not picking up on social cues, yes, that's a communication problem, and one that could be solved with better parenting (teaching her to recognize those cues; possibly having to teach Mia how to be clearer about giving those cues? who knows).  But, even if that's the root of the problem, OP does say that they had to tell her to stop bothering Mia because Mia didn't want to play in the same way, and that \\*does\\* sound like \"not taking no for an answer\".  The two issues aren't mutually exclusive, and one may be leading to the other.\n\nThe problem there is that on OP's side, all she \\*can\\* really do is tell Georgia to stop bothering Mia.  It would be up to Georgia's parents to work with her on recognizing others' social cues, not OP. And if Georgia's parents won't do that, and \\*maybe\\* won't even recognize that there's an issue, I can see how OP would feel stuck.\n\nBuuuuut, again, a lot of speculation going on there.", "That literally plays into consent and teaching children the power of the word no and how important it is to respect someone when they say no.  So flipping irritating", "ESH\n\nLike, yes it\u2019s Mia\u2019s party. Yes she should be allowed to choose. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the only bad thing you can say about Georgia, is that she\u2019s slightly annoying. She hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, she\u2019s not bullying your daughter, and OF COURSE she\u2019s is going to know about the party. It\u2019s a yearly occurrence. My mother doesn\u2019t have to tell me when Black Friday is, it\u2019s literally a yearly event. So you and Mia are excluding Georgia on purpose, and Georgia will be very much hurt by it. \n\nYour SIL sucks, because she\u2019s trying to punish the whole family, for something you and your daughter did. \n\nIt\u2019s all really sad to be honest.", "ESH. It's the way you handled it. You expected these people to turn a cold shoulder to their daughter while they go to a party that she isn't invited to. In your mind, these parties are clearly distinct. But I know if I brought my kid with me to a party 2 years in a row, I wouldn't feel that way. You offended them. Not Georgia. \n\nYou should have been direct with them. Not expect them to take the \"hint\". The hint is that their daughter was snubbed. How did you expect them to take that? \n\nYou should have called them up and discussed it openly. \n\nNow your SIL has definitely not handled the offense gracefully. Telling Georgia was cruel and petty. Not coming to Christmas is an overreaction.", "I agree that Mia should only invite who she wants,  but I also agree that the 2 parties shouldn't be on the same day. \nThat's poor planning.", "Major AH. Way to teach your kid to be a lame like you. Absolutely disgusting behaviour on your part. I'd cut all contact with your lame family after that. I wouldn't want myself let alone my child to have to be around supposed family that made them feel unwanted. Grow up and get therepy.", "Georgia would probably end up not having a good time anyway. I remember the weird things that happened to the odd kid out at parties, I remember at times being that odd kid out. And it was very obvious and very uncomfortable. Georgia being forced is likely the worst choice. Even if the girls aren\u2019t intentionally mean or anything I think she would end up like a \u201cthird wheel\u201d. I think OP is a supportive mom and that\u2019s awesome to see. Georgias mom is an idiot for intentionally hurting her daughter\u2019s feelings over this. NTA", "My mom used to make me invite her friend's daughter to my parties and it was always awkward bc I didn't know her, we weren't friends, and we had nothing in common.  It definitely impacted the fun and cohesion of the group.  NTA", "Honestly, I applaud OP for this as a person who was forced to invite, not a relative but my mom's friend's daughter to my birthday for far too long. Especially if she's not friends with or doesn't know the other kids that are going to be there. It just puts Mia in an awkward position.", "As a kid, I was forced to invite my parent's friends kids, and I had to go to their parties too.\n\n\nI walked out of a slumber party in the middle of the night at about 8 years old because they were bullying me.\n\n\nI agree, op is NTA", "Agreed! You\u2019re doing an amazing job being your daughter\u2019s protector and trust me, it\u2019ll go a long way as she gets older.", "As someone who was always forced to spend time with cousins I never got along with, thank you for standing up for your daughter!!! She shouldn\u2019t have to invite someone for the sake of inviting someone. You could also have your daughter\u2019s party on a different day to avoid family conflicts, if that works. If not, tough titties to the SIL and cousin", "Agree 100%", "My sentiments in a nutshell,  OP NTA", "She doesn't \"barely know her\", they're cousins, they've been playing together for seven years. Mia has kind of outgrown Georgia though, they aren't close friends.", "This. It\u2019s not a *family* gathering. It\u2019s a social gathering. If OP was trying to exclude the child from coming to a whole family gathering, I\u2019d say asshole, but that\u2019s not the case here. SIL is nuts.", "Honestly, I'm kind of think NAH.\n\nMy family is very blended from when I was 5. I happened to end up being cousins with kids I already went to school with. We weren't friends (they were younger than me) but they came to my parties because... Family? And I didn't actively dislike them, they just weren't my friends and they had all been cousins since they born so they just did their own thing.\n\nOn the otherhand, my mom really liked this one kid who I actively hated (they were horrible to me and most other kids but super sweet around adults) and my mom insisted that if I wanted everyone else from our class, they had to be invited too. I refused so she told their parents about my party and I was pissed. \n\nKid came along dressed up and with a gift, parents let the kids play while they mingled. My cousins did whatever they were doing and kid who was horrible just ended up hanging out with adults because noone wanted to play with them. \n\nMy mom stands by inviting the kid because I think her parents realized that noone wanted to play and they became a much nicer person to everyone so it worked out until they moved a year or so later. \n\nIm still pissed my mom didn't respect my request (she bought me up strong, it's her own fault) but I understand why she went against a 5 year olds decision to not hurt another 5 year old. Id been going through shit with my parents divorce, I'd have been crushed if I wasn't invited to a birthday party with everyone else. I have no idea what the horrible kids home life was like but as an adult, I'd take my mom's lead and invite the horrible kid even if my kid didn't want then there.", "They\u2019re 10 and 11 and have known each other since they were 3 and 4. That\u2019s 7 years. Sorry, but after 7 years of interaction, the kids know each other. \n\nNot saying there should be a forced interaction. But the kids are not strangers, and clearly know each other, even if they have differing personalities.", "NTA I completely agree with you", "This. I just don't understand how OP could be this clueless in life. Of course they assume there's going to be a kids party with Mia cause that's what happens every year. They bring the daughter. She flat out said her daughter wasn't welcome this year, even though there's a party. That's not going to go over well in the family.", "YES! Thank you! There's being right and there's being empathetic. Guess which one you are, OP. \nMia has every right not to invite Georgia. Georgia has every right to be upset about that. And Georgia's parents have the right to feel offended. So yes, you're technically not doing anything wrong by not inviting Georgia. But in the real world it is a bit of an asshole move.", "I don't get why people force this situation with children.  I recently had to do a security clearance with work and when asking about siblings I literally put general area of residence  and the fact we have spoke maybe 5 words to each other in 10 years.  No further questions asked as an adult.  but as a child you should talk to your family it's kinda baffling to me.", "yeah i completely agree with this.", "Boy, it's easier to make yourself look right when you just straight up lie.", "Except it's an entirely separate party.  These aren't the kids of the guests at the adult party, these are Mia's school friends.", "You\u2019re just weird. They\u2019re fucking kids, it sounds like YOU have something against little miss Georgia.", "My sister, who is two years older than me, is family. When she had birthday parties in fourth, fifth, sixth grade, I didn't expect to be allowed to join in just because they were at our house.", "I would love to know how you \"didn't see this coming,\" but expected your SIL to \"get the hint\" that her daughter wasn't invited. If her kid has been invited the last two years, it's very natural for her next question to be, \"so what time should I bring my daughter over?\"\n\nYou want your SIL to be a mind reader while you apparently cannot foresee the most obvious of situations.", "Agree with the other comment. Tacky\u2026 why even hose a Xmas party?", "I think SIL and brother want to be able to drink without worrying about taking care of Georgia. Where is Mias party held, and how are the parties not overlapping? Are both parties at OP's house? Who is in charge of the kids if the grown ups are drinking", "It makes me wonder if little Georgia doesn\u2019t have many friends and mom (OP SIL) is trying to force that whole\nCousins are your first friends into magically happening. I feel for Georgia because she\u2019s just a kid and I think her mom is making her life hard on her intentionally or not. OP I say NTA because as you said it\u2019s your daughters party and she should have who she wants there your SIL sounds like she needs some therapy in my unprofessional opinion", "Because likely the SIL doesn't really know why Mia doesn't want Georgia there. As a parent I'd say we sometimes wear pretty rose colored glasses and aren't always willing to see the truth in front of us. It could also be that she sees Georgia's behavior as age appropriate and can't fathom why it'd be a problem for another kid, especially a younger one. Georgia may also not have a lot of friends and her parents could see this as a social outlet for her. SIL isn't necessarily being malicous", "Agree.  Georgia\u2019s mom referred to it as the kids party.", "It also means the first dual party happened in 2020. Given everything else that was going on at the time, it's.... interesting.", "Ahh the annual family tradition of excluding one person and then playing dumb\u2026", "Then she would have to spend her time supervising a bunch of girls,  spending money on all the fun things to do etc. I get the feeling that is at least a part of the issue here. SIL expected to be able to go to the party (which had they still wanted to they couldn't now unless they had someone to watch Georgia since it's kid free), and they expected to able to go home (or go out whichever) afterwards kid free since they expected Georgia to be at the sleepover. She wants Georgia to be able to enjoy a sleepover without SIL doing the work. \n\nPersonally i wouldn't want my kids to go to parties where they don't know/ don't really get along with anyone there. They would be bored and miserable and end up just getting their feelings hurt. And even after being told Georgia wasn't invited she went and TOLD HER about the party thinking that would get her an invite. That was just cruel. She intentionally hurt her daughters feelings. I really hope she didn't actually tell her and just said she did to try to make OP feel bad but I just don't feel like that's the case. Which is just so sad to me :( I just can't imagine purposely hurting my kids feelings", "That's a fair point but daughter might not have friends. I think some people take for granted just how hard it is for some adults to make friends and especially friends the same age as their kids. Depending on Georgia's school, it could be that she doesn't want some of those kids in her house.", "I actually like this idea. While I feel that OP and her daughter ARE excluding Georgia, on the basis of being slightly annoying, the SIL holding a personal Christmas party for Georgia and her friends, would immediately solve that problem, because both girls would be in the same position.", "Sorry but I absolutely hate this narrative you\u2019re trying to push here. \n\n\nNot everyone has to be accepted. Not everyone is liked. So many other commenters have said their negative experiences \u201caccepting\u201d the weird kid and been put in bad situations. \n\n\nMia doesn\u2019t like her and doesn\u2019t want her there. Why should she invite Georgina?", "So whats your solution, bring Georgia into a party with a bunch of girls she doesnt know, that dont match her energy, and she wasnt even invited? Thats literally a recipe for those awkward childhood flashbacks that keep you up at night 10 years later.", "This is the age, too, where kids who were 'friends' because of proximity often grow apart.", "I have to admit that I do have a tendency to refer to classmates as friends. I want the children in my class to love and accept one another.  I do, however, allow children to set boundaries when they have a problem with someone.  A child in my class recently had an issue with a boy in a different class.  The other child is very aggressive and the child in my class is very well mannered.  My student has been quite vocal about not liking the aggressive boy and has said that he doesn't want to play with him.  I told him that, while it is inappropriate to refer to the other boy as a mean kid, he is well within his rights to tell the other boy that he will not play or associate with him during PE and specials until he can be kind.  You've given me something to think about though.", "Difference is that this is... Family. No matter how you try to justify this situation it directly relates to family matters and that needs to be taken into account.", "This is why toys from home weren't allowed when I was teaching unless we were doing a special thing where everyone brought something from home with them.", "I dont make my kids share unless they invite someone to our home to a playdate, but I have them put away anything special or have them tell them what is off limits. I did baby sit a few kids and my daughter who was in kinder didn't mind if specific ones  played with her stuff like the barbie house but wanted stuff just put away. I  told them what was off limits. For others she didn't want we had more of community toys down stairs and specials kept upstairs. Now I dont have any kids over unless they are home.   If we go somewhere it is theirs and they dont have to share. Same with tablets or switches. They dont have to share. Also their teachers dont make you invite the whole class. The parents will give the invites and the  teacher will give it to the kids alone.", "First of all, you should have communicated this beforehand instead of sneaking around and trying to avoid confrontation and giving \"hints.\" You and your SIL are grown adults, act like it. Also, if the party has happened for two years in a row, Georgia's obviously going to know unless you lie about it being cancelled. \n\nYour SIL tried to bully you and your daughter into inviting someone that your daughter didn't want to invite and refused to respect your daughter's wishes at **her party,** and that alone makes her an AH.\n\nOverall, ESH. This situation sounds like a mess that could be easily avoided with clearer planning and communication.", "Everybody sucks here. \n\nSo instead of coming to the part your brother has to hire a baby sitter to sit with the kid while he and her mother go to a party with a party for the kid who doesn't like her. \n\nWow everyone sucks.", "Unrelated but do the other kids\u2019 parents know that you are having a bunch of strangers near their kids. Probably over indulging in alcohol. This seems so unsafe and horribly planned already. NTA for not inviting someone your daughter doesn\u2019t like but AH for making an unsafe environment for minors.", "YTA for the reasons already mentioned. \n\nYou\u2019re literally uninviting your niece while inviting her parents. \n\nWouldn\u2019t be an issue if Mia\u2019s party was at a different location or day but the way it\u2019s structured, you\u2019re splitting hairs to exclude your 11 year old niece.", "Thank you for allowing your daughter to have boundaries. It will help prevent her getting into toxic relationships in the future just to \u201ckeep other people happy\u201d. \n\nNot letting people stomp on your boundaries does not make you a bully. People really need to stop calling people mean or a bully because they made a perfectly acceptable decision you don\u2019t like. \n\nThey told Georgia about the party, now they have to accept the consequence of that decision, ie dealing with Georgia being upset. It wasn\u2019t your decision and you\u2019re not responsible for the outcome, or for fixing it. \n\nIf they don\u2019t come to Christmas, that\u2019s their decision, and their problem. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame, we\u2019ll miss seeing you.\u201d is an acceptable and appropriate response. They\u2019ll be the ones missing out. It has nothing to do with you, or Mia. It\u2019s absolutely dead set manipulation.

Was there something else? Otherwise, I need to go.\u201d Shut down any discussion about it. If she continues, you say \u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t going to discuss this so I\u2019m going to go now, bye\u201d and hang up (or walk away).

That's normal and dealt with in the same manner Georgia's parents could deal with this, by getting a babysitter. Or by Georgia staying home alone if her parents deem her ready for that. It's not a recipe for disaster if the parents aren't idiots but unfortunately Georgia's parents are idiots", "Its funny that throughout this entire rant not once did you stop and think what will happen if Georgia does show up to that party, uninvited and unwanted by her peers. Kids can tell when theyre not welcomed at a party and trust me, Georgia does not deserve to be the girl sitting in a corner while all the others have fun because they dont have anything in common other than their ages. Youre getting mad defensive over what Georgia will feel, but as an adult sometimes your job is to make sure your child doesnt embarrass themselves and get experiences that will shame them for the rest of their lives. Also, Mia has every right to want to choose who she invites to her party. Why do Georgia's feelings matter more than Mia's boundaries? Thats a terrible lesson to teach both kids!", "This", "I\u2019m floored at the amount of people not understanding this.", "If my daughter or son don\u2019t want someone at THEIR party, then they aren\u2019t invited. Plain and simple. Not all cousins get along, I in fact don\u2019t have any interest in a few of mine. \nIt\u2019s literally two different parties, and the daughter has spoken.
