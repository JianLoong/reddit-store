I have been working as a batista since 14 years old so I  have saved quite a bit of money and hope I can leave my mom the moment I go into college. Why? My mom had me @16 and just not a very good mom. She was still a child when she had me, so I got a very different version of her than my siblings do. We were poor, she took out her stress and anger out on me alot and was never really present in my life.  As I got older and started working, she started charging me rent and only uped my rent once I turned 16. The only reason I have my license is so I can drive my siblings around when needed or run errands for her. I spend alot of my time working and usually watch my siblings 4 times a week so she and her fiance can go out or whatever she needs to do. I make the twins dinner, I give them a bath, I read them stories and tuck them in- all of that. \n\nAnyways, my mom said I had to watch the twins but I had told her I had asked to go to the movies with friends a week ago and she said yes. She said she doesn't remember that, I must be making it up, so the answer is no, I had to watch the twins. I asked her if I could get paid and she said no, because I'm family.  I told her I put the twins down to bed more than she does during the week and it's not fair. I didn't ask to have siblings and I didn't choose to have them. It's not my responsibility. My mom said she had it worse- she did what do with the twins but everyday. I reminded my mom that was the consequences of her actions however, I never got pregnant. I told my mom I was going to the movies and she would have to find someone else if she wasn't going to pay me. \n\nI ended up going and now I'm sitting here a few days later feeling guilty.  But on the other hand, I rarely ever get to do things with friends. I never ask anything from my mom.  I'm a straight A, 4.0 student. I don't get in trouble in school or with the law. I've never dated or smoke or drank or even been to a party. I work, sleep, study and watch my siblings. I'm allowed to have fun. However, my mom is refusing to talk-  unless its to remind me im selfish and a disrespectful daughter- to me so idk if I'm in the wrong or not.", "created_utc": 1690537518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bstgb/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_wont_watch_my_siblings/", "score": 533, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Consider talking to a teacher/counselor about this.\n\n\nPlease don\u2019t feel guilty for putting yourself first once in your life. What your mother is expecting from you is beyond the pale. Sure, babysitting *in an emergency* should be expected from an older sibling, but not parenting their siblings. There\u2019s no excuse for her behavior towards you. She\u2019s an adult and chose to have children again, despite knowing how it usually affects their parents\u2018 lives. And now she\u2019s putting the wirk on you because she did it at your age?
