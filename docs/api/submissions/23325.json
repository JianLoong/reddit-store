She said she doesn't remember that, I must be making it up, so the answer is no, I had to watch the twins. I asked her if I could get paid and she said no, because I'm family.  I told her I put the twins down to bed more than she does during the week and it's not fair. I didn't ask to have siblings and I didn't choose to have them. It's not my responsibility.

I told my mom I was going to the movies and she would have to find someone else if she wasn't going to pay me. \n\nI ended up going and now I'm sitting here a few days later feeling guilty.

I don\u2019t know where you are but it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s even illegal to charge your minor child rent, and parentification - which is what your mother is doing to you - is considered abuse. Consider talking to a teacher/counselor about this.\n\n\nPlease don\u2019t feel guilty for putting yourself first once in your life. What your mother is expecting from you is beyond the pale. Sure, babysitting *in an emergency* should be expected from an older sibling, but not parenting their siblings. There\u2019s no excuse for her behavior towards you. She\u2019s an adult and chose to have children again, despite knowing how it usually affects their parents\u2018 lives. And now she\u2019s putting the wirk on you because she did it at your age? As you said, it\u2019s quite a difference to have to go through it when it was your own choice. A sibling does not have that responsibility!", "NTA \n\nYour mother is horrible! She is essentially treating you like a free live in baby sitter. You did the right thing by standing your ground. \n\nIs there a possibility you could go live with your grandparents or father? Perhaps another relative until you turn 18? To be honest this doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy environment for you to be living in.", "NTA.

Parentification is a real thing and charging rent to a young teenager sucks majorly.", "NTA - what you are experiencing is Parentification.  Your mom is making your raise your twin siblings.  And since you are underage your mom shouldn't be charging you any rent.  If there isn't anyone else in your family you can live with hang in there and move out the second you turn 18 and don't look back.", "NTA, you feel guilty because your mom makes you feel guilty so you feel obligated to do all this stuff. You are completely right you never asked her to make sacrifices to have you at 16 she did that and she can't expect an iou for that.", "NTA. \n\nYou had asked beforehand and been given permission. It's not your fault that she doesn't remember. Also, you're not the hired help haha.

You brought up some great points and I'm kinda pissed FOR you. haha.   \n\n\nThey're not your children, not your responsibility. It's not YOUR fault that things happened to your mom at a young age.

Your mom is just upset because you called her out on her stuff and you put your foot down on a boundary that inconveniences her. Never feel guilty for setting a healthy boundary!", "NTA. Your mom sucks, don't give her more money, she's legally obligated to feed, call CPS, your mom will never appreciate what you do for her.", "I'm pretty sure it's illegal to charge rent to your kid under 18.

Your mother sounds like a piece of work, and confirms it by not only charging a 16 year old rent, but forcing you to be the one constantly taking care of her children.
