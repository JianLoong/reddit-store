I have been working as a batista since 14 years old so I  have saved quite a bit of money and hope I can leave my mom the moment I go into college. Why? My mom had me @16 and just not a very good mom. She was still a child when she had me, so I got a very different version of her than my siblings do. We were poor, she took out her stress and anger out on me alot and was never really present in my life.  As I got older and started working, she started charging me rent and only uped my rent once I turned 16. The only reason I have my license is so I can drive my siblings around when needed or run errands for her. I spend alot of my time working and usually watch my siblings 4 times a week so she and her fiance can go out or whatever she needs to do. I make the twins dinner, I give them a bath, I read them stories and tuck them in- all of that. \n\nAnyways, my mom said I had to watch the twins but I had told her I had asked to go to the movies with friends a week ago and she said yes. She said she doesn't remember that, I must be making it up, so the answer is no, I had to watch the twins. I asked her if I could get paid and she said no, because I'm family.  I told her I put the twins down to bed more than she does during the week and it's not fair. I didn't ask to have siblings and I didn't choose to have them. It's not my responsibility. My mom said she had it worse- she did what do with the twins but everyday. I reminded my mom that was the consequences of her actions however, I never got pregnant. I told my mom I was going to the movies and she would have to find someone else if she wasn't going to pay me. \n\nI ended up going and now I'm sitting here a few days later feeling guilty.  But on the other hand, I rarely ever get to do things with friends. I never ask anything from my mom.  I'm a straight A, 4.0 student. I don't get in trouble in school or with the law. I've never dated or smoke or drank or even been to a party. I work, sleep, study and watch my siblings. I'm allowed to have fun. However, my mom is refusing to talk-  unless its to remind me im selfish and a disrespectful daughter- to me so idk if I'm in the wrong or not.", "created_utc": 1690537518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bstgb/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_wont_watch_my_siblings/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t know where you are but it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s even illegal to charge your minor child rent, and parentification - which is what your mother is doing to you - is considered abuse. Consider talking to a teacher/counselor about this.\n\n\nPlease don\u2019t feel guilty for putting yourself first once in your life. What your mother is expecting from you is beyond the pale. Sure, babysitting *in an emergency* should be expected from an older sibling, but not parenting their siblings. There\u2019s no excuse for her behavior towards you. She\u2019s an adult and chose to have children again, despite knowing how it usually affects their parents\u2018 lives. And now she\u2019s putting the wirk on you because she did it at your age? As you said, it\u2019s quite a difference to have to go through it when it was your own choice. A sibling does not have that responsibility!", "NTA \n\nYour mother is horrible! She is essentially treating you like a free live in baby sitter. You did the right thing by standing your ground. \n\nIs there a possibility you could go live with your grandparents or father? Perhaps another relative until you turn 18? To be honest this doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy environment for you to be living in.", "NTA. Please call CPS on your mother or ask a trusted adult to do it for you.\n\nYou should not be paying rent or spending so much time watching your siblings. She's the parent and has to provide for you guys.", "NTA \n\nLook I\u2019m all for being a good daughter/son to your parents but you\u2019ve gone above and beyond what most kids will ever do and she\u2019s still treating you like shit. I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to get out of that situation the first chance you get. Don\u2019t feel bad, you deserve some time for yourself too, you\u2019re only 16 you\u2019re not a mother.", "NTA. You aren't the live in help (and you probably need to point this out) so please don't feel guilty.\n\nRather than fight with your Mom, have you considered trying to negotiate with her and asked for a discount on your rent in exchange for looking after the kids?", "NTA, I was 18 when my youngest sister was born and standing my ground caused world war 3 but you are right. You didn\u2019t agree to have kids and I would stick with your moving out plan.", "NTA. You are not the parent. Parentification is a real thing and charging rent to a young teenager sucks majorly.", "NTA - what you are experiencing is Parentification.  Your mom is making your raise your twin siblings.  And since you are underage your mom shouldn't be charging you any rent.  If there isn't anyone else in your family you can live with hang in there and move out the second you turn 18 and don't look back.", "NTA, you feel guilty because your mom makes you feel guilty so you feel obligated to do all this stuff. You are completely right you never asked her to make sacrifices to have you at 16 she did that and she can't expect an iou for that.", "NTA. \n\nYou had asked beforehand and been given permission. It's not your fault that she doesn't remember. Also, you're not the hired help haha. And although it's normal for kids to help their parents sometimes, with some things, being \"the help\" constantly, isn't normal. You brought up some great points and I'm kinda pissed FOR you. haha.   \n\n\nThey're not your children, not your responsibility. It's not YOUR fault that things happened to your mom at a young age. Although it's good to have responsibilities and learn to be a \"grownup\" as you get older, you're still a child technically, yourself, and you should be able to BE a child and have fun. Your mom is just upset because you called her out on her stuff and you put your foot down on a boundary that inconveniences her. Never feel guilty for setting a healthy boundary!", "NTA. Your mom sucks, don't give her more money, she's legally obligated to feed, call CPS, your mom will never appreciate what you do for her.", "I'm pretty sure it's illegal to charge rent to your kid under 18. Voluntarily helping with family expenses or something like paying your own phone/internet is okay afaik, but housing is your RIGHT that your parents MUST provide until you turn 18.", "NTA\n\nIt is illegal for your mother to be charging you rent as a minor. She is legally and financially responsible for you until you are 18. Please look into this.", "Wow I don't understand people like this.  Sorry for your situation.  Your mother sounds like a piece of work, and confirms it by not only charging a 16 year old rent, but forcing you to be the one constantly taking care of her children.  I don't doubt she is only charging you rent so that she has spending money for her dates.  You won't see a dime of that back ever.  You are being used.\n\nNTA- Get out as soon as you can.\n\nStrange\\_Discount's mom, is you ever read this post for some odd reason......from me to you, YOU SUCK!", "NTA\nShe tells you that you get nothing for free? But she expects you to watch the twins for free.. Find the mistake.\n\nConcentrate on your school and try to move out as soon as possible. You're a good kid. But she is stealing your childhood. It was her decision to have a child early and now she is stealing your teenage years as a \"revenge\". That's not fair. A 16-year-old shouldn't pay for her mother's mistakes.", "Start stashing cash, birth certificate, etc. Keep your grades up so scholarships will be available to you. You can set yourself up for a quick exit the second you're 18. I mean one minute after midnight on your 18th birthday, get out and don't look back! Block her number, get counseling to help you make that clean break. She's eating you alive. A bank can help you find out if she's tried or has credit in your name. Get assistance with blocking that from happening also. I'll be out here praying for you", "NTA.

Bank of America allows 16 YOs to open accounts without parental oversight.  \n2. Stop paying her rent.  Save the money instead.\n3. You want to keep her somewhat appeased since you still have to live there for the next two years (unless you have somewhere else to go), so still babysit a day or two a week, but only when you are available.\n4. Look into college.  Talk to a counselor about financial independence, since most financial aid will be dependent upon your parents' income.  I doubt your mother will be helpful in getting rid of her babysitter, so she may refuse to fill out the forms for you. There are some colleges that do give full merit scholarships, so ask a counselor about those as well.  As a straight A student who works and takes care of family (be sure to put this down on applications as something you that takes up your time!), I am sure you will have lots of doors open for you!\n5. 5.
