You are entitled to have a couples trip (which you're super excited for) without having to invite your family, or make it a group discussion. Even if you didn't mention it to them at all, you should not have HAVE to do so as an adult. Your life is seperate from theirs. Enjoy the alone time with your partner.", "NTA.

Yes, maybe at a small discount, but definitely not cheap.", "NTA.

Enjoy your trip with your boyfriend.  If mom wants to keep yapping remind her that you've spent years trying to plan with her and dad, but they never seemed to care or want to go.  This is going to be your first trip alone with your boyfriend and it's a couples trip, not family.  Lay that out to her and stand strong.", "But this wasn't a family trip.  It's a trip for you & your boyfriend & you are old enough to be trusted to go alone.  You don't need a chaperone, you're both adults.  You've done nothing wrong.  NTA.  And you have been trying to get your parents to go & they refuse & now they want to come?  Why the change of heart now?", "and when you and a SO plan a family trip, your parents may be invited. but this isn't a family trip. this is a trip for you and your SO, no family need apply.\n\nof course, you get invited on family trips. you're family. you and your BF would likely invite your parents on a family trip if you planned a trip that included his parents. but again, that isn't what this is.\n\nNTA", "NTA heck no this is not a family trip it's a couple trip!\n\nBut be careful, July in Japan is rough- make sure you stay super hydrated and get cooling patches if you're not from an area that has that combo of heat and thick humidity to begin with.", "NTA.

Do not them go and enjoy your trip with your SO.", "NTA\n\nJust because someone else chooses to do something, doesn't mean you need to reciprocate every time. A person can go on family trips, couples trips, and solo trips all at their own discretion. They don't ever have to commit to just one option.\n\nMoreover, you have asked about a trip to Japan in the past and gotten lukewarm responses. They only want in now because you've already invested time and money planning it, so they don't have to do anything. You're planning to go next month. It's too late for them even if you had been okay with inviting them.\n\nAlso your mom saying you guys can't be trusted to go by yourself is really insulting. It's Japan. I went to Japan on a student exchange when I was 17. You better believe I did months of travelling by myself, because nobody was escorting a teenager to school across a bus and two trains every single day for months, and I was perfectly fine. Never even so much as a train pervert. You guys will be fine.", "Your mom is already having a trip, a guilt trip. NTA, enjoy your vacation!", "NTA.

She complained until the day she died about how I didn't spend enough time with her. Tell her that she can plan her own trip to Japan.", "NTA. Enjoy your trip!", "There is a fairly large trade in used designer bags in Japan.  Broad generalisation here but a section of the Japanese that can afford such bags are also very picky about them and will sell them on if they get a scratch or a stain. So you can find cheaper designer bags in Japan but they won't be considered perfect specimens and will be second hand.   You're still talking hundreds and thousands of dollars though, no one is selling a Hermes Birkin for \u00a320 or Luis Vuitton for pennies .", "My bf and I are paying for it, him moreso than me because he has a full time job and I\u2019m in college so I\u2019m contributing some savings money to it."]}
