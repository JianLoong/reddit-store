To say that it\u2019s been hard is a gross understatement, especially with my SIL and nephew. My nephew is autistic with possible ADHD (they\u2019re waiting on getting a formal diagnosis from his doctor). I also have ADHD so some of Bobby\u2019s stimming (random loud noises mostly) is overstimulating for me but I can handle it.\n\nI have a little Yorkie, named Chewie. She was a puppy mill mama and my husband and I rescued her. Since rescuing her, I will admit that we spoil her. Chewie is 13 years old and has some health issues so we try to make her as comfortable as possible. She\u2019s not in any pain or anything, just high maintenance. \n\nMy brother and SIL believe in gentle parenting and encouraging their kids to be comfortable in setting boundaries. When it comes to my nephew I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working. Mainly because there\u2019s no consequences for his actions. My SIL loves to play the \u201che\u2019s autistic\u201d card at every opportunity, especially when he does something he\u2019s not supposed to. \n\nBobby has a tendency to chase Chewie until he has her cornered, yank on her ears when he\u2019s petting her, be extra loud around her, sneak up on her and scare her to the point where she\u2019s cowering in the corner. I\u2019ve tried talking to him about this and to teach him how to act around Chewie. He literally looks at me and just giggles. I\u2019ve also tried talking to brother and SIL about this and as usual SIL says \u201cOh he\u2019s just stimming. He needs the stimulation in order to regulate his emotions.\u201d \n\nThis morning the shit hit the fan. While making breakfast for everyone, Bobby was chasing Chewie again. After days of calmly but firmly asking Bobby to leave Chewie alone, I snapped and physically blocked him and yelled \u201cI said knock it off and leave her alone!\u201d Well you can imagine this lead to a massive meltdown. SIL freaks out and yells at me, calling me every name in the book and how dare I yell at her child! My response was the following, \u201cWow you preach but you don\u2019t teach don\u2019t you?! You sit there and expect the rest of the world to bend over backwards for Bobby but God forbid you should actually invest any energy into teaching Bobby to respect other people\u2019s boundaries including animals. Chewie is NOT here to be his play thing or his stim to help him regulate his emotions! That\u2019s your fucking job to guide him on how to do that and you two dipshits have failed miserably at it!\u201d SIL left sobbing as well as Emily because she thinks she\u2019s being punished. \n\nAfter they left and I cooled off, I called my parents to get their perspective. While they agreed that I was in the right in defending Chewie from Bobby they say that I didn\u2019t need to yell at him and to call my brother and SIL failures at being parents. Hubby supports me 100%. I just feel so guilty and I can\u2019t shake it.

And honestly, the toothpaste is sort of out of the tube. \nYou said some hard truths in a really mean way. It will be difficult to repair the relationship with your SIL- if that\u2019s even something you want to do. For the sake of your niece and nephew, I hope you all can move past this. I don\u2019t have any real advice on how to do that other than apologizing for the way you reacted and explaining in a more calm manner what your concerns are. Let them know that how they choose to raise their kids is up to them, but for the time being they aren\u2019t welcome in your home. Best of luck.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sick of this gentle parenting stuff since people take it as a cop out to do any actual parenting and end up raising entitled pricks. You\u2019re Chewie\u2019s advocate and I\u2019d put money on the fact if she had ended up biting your nephew after getting fed up with him, your SIL would\u2019ve cried foul and demanded she be put down and fell back on the \u2018he\u2019s autistic, he\u2019s just a kid, he doesn\u2019t know better!\u2019 shtick. If he\u2019s looking at you and giggling he knows damn well what he\u2019s doing, and if he\u2019s autistic to the point he genuinely can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing is wrong, he should not be allowed around your dog.", "NTA.

You handled it a lot better than I would have, but I'm petty. They clearly have no intention of enforcing any sort of discipline and it will probably only get worse.

But your brother and SIL needed to hear it. Their approach isn't working. If they want to teach about setting boundaries, they also need to teach the kids about respecting boundaries.", "NTA", "NTA, you lasted longer than I would have. Children with autism can learn just as well as others, IF they have the right guidance. Sometimes they are even better because of their sensory and emotional needs. You Brother and SIL are just assholes leaning into excuses.", "NTA. Quite apart from the fact that its your job to protect Chewie, your brother and SIL's failure to do anything about it puts their kid at risk. What's gonna happen when he pulls this shit with a less placid dog?", "Nta your nephews lack of parenting shouldn't be your problem. Spoiled children get what they deserve", "NTA probs could have handled different but whatever. You already talked his parents and his  mom just made excuses. Raising autistic children is not for the weak, they need extra patience and whatnot. But it doesn\u2019t seems like SIL knows how to teach him in a way he understands. Seems like she needs to go to classes to help understand or find a new approach to teaching him. My brother started going to those classes and he has improved and has even become more verbal as well. Point is, you\u2019re NTA and he was being abusive to your poor dog and you just protected her.", "Nope , nope ,a thousand times nope", "NTA\nYou come to my house and torture my dog, me yelling is going to be the least of your worries. \n\nBobby's parents are the assholes. I guarantee you that the minute Chewie defended herself and bit, your SIL would have gone on a rampage to have her euthanized.", "NTA\nSorry but they kind of are failing as parents: your kid can have many different issues and get along just fine in life but if you teach them the world revolves around them and to act like an ah everywhere they go then you have failed as a parent. Sounds like your SIL amd brother are setting the kid up to be hated by everyone.", "NTA.  Animals are not playthings.   And gentle parenting seems like a cop-out in this case; the child has no boundaries and parents are excusing him with the autism card.   Shitty, disrespectful behaviour is shitty, disrespectful behaviour,  no matter how much candy coating they try to apply. \n\nWould they have been so laissez faire if Chewie was a large \"aggressive-looking\" dog?  Highly unlikely!", "Please do not feel guilty. NTA. Remember that Simpson\u2019s line \u201cWe\u2019ve tried nothing and we\u2019re all out of ideas\u201d. Gentle parenting does not mean letting a child do whatever they want in the moment.", "There a difference between gentle parenting and lack of parenting. The amount of parents who believe they can check out of parental duty while calling it gentle parenting is gobsmacking. \n\nNot loosing it on a child, making them understand actions have consequences, and they are responsible for their own behaviour, ain\u2019t the same as being a spectator of them running wild while asking others to bends boundaries.", "No, you're not OP.\n\nGood job at reading your SIL the riot act.\n\nIf the kid keeps terrorizing your pet, no reasonable person would blame you for banning him from your house.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, and don't let these people into your house again.\n\nAlso, don't ask your mother what she thinks. Mothers always side with the aggressor against you.\n\nYour nephew is a monster that your SIL created with her new-wave parenting, meaning she never tells him no.\n\nFor gosh sakes, stop playing poor little me and throw these destructive freaks out of your life.", "NTA, I have two severely autistic kids myself, and they know right from wrong.. it's the SIL's fault if she worked with her son, he would know better. The kid knows he can get away with it with his mom there. You didn't need to yell, but sometimes that's the only way to get the point across. Plus, you sound frustrated.", "NTA-more importantly did you actually protect Chewie and is she ok? And dog tax demands a photo", "NTA", "NTA, and that poor puppy.  That kid is lucky he didn\u2019t get a bite out of his face. This is a time that yelling was appropriate. Not everyone is going to be able to handle a child acting like that not everyone is going to be excepting of a child being cruel to a dog. What do parents are allowing this child to do is cruel to the child it\u2019s not right.", "I agree. That is not gentle parenting. It is not parenting at all. We do gentle parenting at home and we would always make sure it does not effect others and keep repeating to the kids and hold them off if needed. \n\nI am wondering why they are at your house. If you like to make peace you could offer to take Emily occasionally or for a few days so they have more time to parent and get their shit together.\n\nGood luck and NTA.", "I don't think it was a mean way.  It was firm.\n\nWith some people, you have to be firm, in order to get the message across.", "If he does, it's only a matter of time until they're banned.", "Nom-nom-nom?", "NTA you were 100% right.\n\nLook i don't Like dogs (buhuu mit every Person is a Dog Lover) but i teach my Kids, that they need to be gentle and careful around dogs and other animals. If you treat them Like Shit, you deserve getting bitten. My be harsh but i think it is the right Thing", "Nta my sister used to do the same for my nephew who has autism and is very very smart. He's quite frankly an asshole and was at 7 onwards because she made excuses and failed to give him boundaries. \n\nThis cuminated in two changes of school in his teenage years because he was an asshole to so many kids at one point an entire gang changed him off the grounds because of his behaviour starting it.\n\nHe's 23 now and still an enormous asshole being enabled by my sister so at least your sil might have had it shocked into her that she needs to deal with this shit.", "NTA", "That's permissive parenting.", "NTA. You handled it perfectly. They needed an ass chewing and now they\u2019re all butt hurt because they know you\u2019re right.", "NTA\n\nYou tried the not yelling approach, several times already. It didn't work.\n\nAlso one persons stims don't get to be at the expense of another beings comfort.", "NTA. You tried talking to the parents, but they ignored your message.", "Are you kidding, that was the best way it could possibly have gone down.\n\nThe worst way it could have gone down ended with a 6 year old getting gotten by a dog, and OPs dog being put down.", "Anger is a useful emotion because it makes us take a stand when reasonable approaches have failed. You asked nicely that your SIL not let your nephew terrorize your dog. You asked repeatedly. It was happening in front of her, she could have been a parent, but chose not to. So you lost your temper and now SIL has to actually deal because it is clear you won't tolerate that any longer.\n\nIf you had not shouted and made a scene, nothing would have changed. So AH or not, this was necessary to defend you and your dog, and a learning moment for your SIL and Bobby. Yes, you could have tried to explain, calmly, again, that something needed to change, but it wouldn't have until it became this much of an issue.", "Not mean at all.  She called a spade a spade.  We don\u2019t have to return to a time where we are sending kids outside to get a switch so we can beat them to discipline them. \n\nBut gentle parenting, aka free range children, aka not actually parenting, is not an acceptable substitute.  There are a myriad of ways to teach kids to be stable and productive members of society, but that requires actually teaching and engaging them, as OP said. \n\nI\u2019d rather her sister cry and feel terrible and change her ways, than release an entitled hellion on society that we all have to deal with.", "I didn\u2019t say it was mean? I said it wasn\u2019t ideal.", "I\u2019m talking about all the things she said to her SIL. And no. It\u2019s not the best way that could have gone down. It\u2019s a small dog. She could have picked the dog up (or the nephew for that matter) and removed them from the situation, then had a strongly worded l, but calmer discussion. All I\u2019m saying is that I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an ah for how it did go down.\n\nEdited typos", "I think you said what I mean better than me!\nI don\u2019t think OP should feel bad about how she responded. It was perfectly understandable in the circumstance. I meant to acknowledge that, yes, a more socially acceptable way to handle that *may* exist, but her reaction was understandable (and maybe even reasonable). OP is nta but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be fallout. The relationship with SIL *will* be affected by her words. That\u2019s unavoidable. But sometimes it\u2019s what\u2019s necessary.", "Perhaps even some cronch-cronch-cronch."]}
