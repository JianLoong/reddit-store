{"id": 25449, "submission_id": "160n6v1", "title": "AITA for snapping at my nephew???", "selftext": "So my Brother (40m), SIL (38F), niece (Emily, 7F), and nephew (Bobby, 6M) have been staying at my house for 5 going on 6 days now. To say that it\u2019s been hard is a gross understatement, especially with my SIL and nephew. My nephew is autistic with possible ADHD (they\u2019re waiting on getting a formal diagnosis from his doctor). I also have ADHD so some of Bobby\u2019s stimming (random loud noises mostly) is overstimulating for me but I can handle it.\n\nI have a little Yorkie, named Chewie. She was a puppy mill mama and my husband and I rescued her. Since rescuing her, I will admit that we spoil her. Chewie is 13 years old and has some health issues so we try to make her as comfortable as possible. She\u2019s not in any pain or anything, just high maintenance. \n\nMy brother and SIL believe in gentle parenting and encouraging their kids to be comfortable in setting boundaries. When it comes to my nephew I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working. Mainly because there\u2019s no consequences for his actions. My SIL loves to play the \u201che\u2019s autistic\u201d card at every opportunity, especially when he does something he\u2019s not supposed to. \n\nBobby has a tendency to chase Chewie until he has her cornered, yank on her ears when he\u2019s petting her, be extra loud around her, sneak up on her and scare her to the point where she\u2019s cowering in the corner. I\u2019ve tried talking to him about this and to teach him how to act around Chewie. He literally looks at me and just giggles. I\u2019ve also tried talking to brother and SIL about this and as usual SIL says \u201cOh he\u2019s just stimming. He needs the stimulation in order to regulate his emotions.\u201d \n\nThis morning the shit hit the fan. While making breakfast for everyone, Bobby was chasing Chewie again. After days of calmly but firmly asking Bobby to leave Chewie alone, I snapped and physically blocked him and yelled \u201cI said knock it off and leave her alone!\u201d Well you can imagine this lead to a massive meltdown. SIL freaks out and yells at me, calling me every name in the book and how dare I yell at her child! My response was the following, \u201cWow you preach but you don\u2019t teach don\u2019t you?! You sit there and expect the rest of the world to bend over backwards for Bobby but God forbid you should actually invest any energy into teaching Bobby to respect other people\u2019s boundaries including animals. Chewie is NOT here to be his play thing or his stim to help him regulate his emotions! That\u2019s your fucking job to guide him on how to do that and you two dipshits have failed miserably at it!\u201d SIL left sobbing as well as Emily because she thinks she\u2019s being punished. \n\nAfter they left and I cooled off, I called my parents to get their perspective. While they agreed that I was in the right in defending Chewie from Bobby they say that I didn\u2019t need to yell at him and to call my brother and SIL failures at being parents. Hubby supports me 100%. I just feel so guilty and I can\u2019t shake it.

Yes.  But no one is perfect. The fact that you feel bad about how your frustration came out shows that you\u2019re NTA. \nFrom what you\u2019ve provided, it does seem like you have some valid points. And honestly, the toothpaste is sort of out of the tube. \nYou said some hard truths in a really mean way. It will be difficult to repair the relationship with your SIL- if that\u2019s even something you want to do. For the sake of your niece and nephew, I hope you all can move past this. I don\u2019t have any real advice on how to do that other than apologizing for the way you reacted and explaining in a more calm manner what your concerns are. Let them know that how they choose to raise their kids is up to them, but for the time being they aren\u2019t welcome in your home. Best of luck.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sick of this gentle parenting stuff since people take it as a cop out to do any actual parenting and end up raising entitled pricks. You\u2019re Chewie\u2019s advocate and I\u2019d put money on the fact if she had ended up biting your nephew after getting fed up with him, your SIL would\u2019ve cried foul and demanded she be put down and fell back on the \u2018he\u2019s autistic, he\u2019s just a kid, he doesn\u2019t know better!\u2019 shtick. If he\u2019s looking at you and giggling he knows damn well what he\u2019s doing, and if he\u2019s autistic to the point he genuinely can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing is wrong, he should not be allowed around your dog.", "NTA. Kids can learn if their parents take the job of teaching instead of using the lazy card of \"he's autistic\", they could have avoided this but they didn't wanted to. Good for you for protecting Chewie", "I\u2019d lean NTA, obviously you could\u2019ve handled the situation a bit better and more maturely, it\u2019s not fair to the dog to constantly be having a kid harassing it, and if the parents aren\u2019t gonna step in you as the dogs owner should", "NTA. You handled it a lot better than I would have, but I'm petty. They clearly have no intention of enforcing any sort of discipline and it will probably only get worse. You should be prepared for that if you let them back into your home.", "NTA. Your SIL needed to hear that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Children with autism can learn just as well as others, IF they have the right guidance. Sometimes they are even better because of their sensory and emotional needs. You Brother and SIL are just assholes leaning into excuses.", "NTA. Quite apart from the fact that its your job to protect Chewie, your brother and SIL's failure to do anything about it puts their kid at risk. What's gonna happen when he pulls this shit with a less placid dog?"]}
