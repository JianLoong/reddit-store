My nephew is autistic with possible ADHD (they\u2019re waiting on getting a formal diagnosis from his doctor). I also have ADHD so some of Bobby\u2019s stimming (random loud noises mostly) is overstimulating for me but I can handle it.\n\nI have a little Yorkie, named Chewie. She was a puppy mill mama and my husband and I rescued her. Since rescuing her, I will admit that we spoil her. Chewie is 13 years old and has some health issues so we try to make her as comfortable as possible. She\u2019s not in any pain or anything, just high maintenance. \n\nMy brother and SIL believe in gentle parenting and encouraging their kids to be comfortable in setting boundaries. When it comes to my nephew I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working. Mainly because there\u2019s no consequences for his actions. My SIL loves to play the \u201che\u2019s autistic\u201d card at every opportunity, especially when he does something he\u2019s not supposed to. \n\nBobby has a tendency to chase Chewie until he has her cornered, yank on her ears when he\u2019s petting her, be extra loud around her, sneak up on her and scare her to the point where she\u2019s cowering in the corner. I\u2019ve tried talking to him about this and to teach him how to act around Chewie. He literally looks at me and just giggles. I\u2019ve also tried talking to brother and SIL about this and as usual SIL says \u201cOh he\u2019s just stimming. He needs the stimulation in order to regulate his emotions.\u201d \n\nThis morning the shit hit the fan. While making breakfast for everyone, Bobby was chasing Chewie again.

SIL freaks out and yells at me, calling me every name in the book and how dare I yell at her child! My response was the following, \u201cWow you preach but you don\u2019t teach don\u2019t you?! You sit there and expect the rest of the world to bend over backwards for Bobby but God forbid you should actually invest any energy into teaching Bobby to respect other people\u2019s boundaries including animals. Chewie is NOT here to be his play thing or his stim to help him regulate his emotions! That\u2019s your fucking job to guide him on how to do that and you two dipshits have failed miserably at it!\u201d SIL left sobbing as well as Emily because she thinks she\u2019s being punished. \n\nAfter they left and I cooled off, I called my parents to get their perspective. While they agreed that I was in the right in defending Chewie from Bobby they say that I didn\u2019t need to yell at him and to call my brother and SIL failures at being parents.

Spoiled children get what they deserve", "NTA probs could have handled different but whatever. You already talked his parents and his  mom just made excuses. Raising autistic children is not for the weak, they need extra patience and whatnot. But it doesn\u2019t seems like SIL knows how to teach him in a way he understands. Seems like she needs to go to classes to help understand or find a new approach to teaching him. My brother started going to those classes and he has improved and has even become more verbal as well.

We do gentle parenting at home and we would always make sure it does not effect others and keep repeating to the kids and hold them off if needed. \n\nI am wondering why they are at your house.

You asked nicely that your SIL not let your nephew terrorize your dog. You asked repeatedly. It was happening in front of her, she could have been a parent, but chose not to.
