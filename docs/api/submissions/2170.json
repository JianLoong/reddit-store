Like for instance I donated plasma today and was so tired after it I could barely keep my eyes open and we have a 10 month old so I was extra tired. I was like \u201cis it ok if I go take a nap?\u201d And he said \u201cyeah just make sure you\u2019re up by 6:30 so I can get a nap in before work\u201d. 6:30 comes along, I get up, get the baby ready for bed then come to the living room. Then he made some \u201cjoke\u201d like \u201cdid you have a good nap? Since YOU decided to take a nap first\u201d all while smiling so it seems like a joke. Then after his nap before work he comes out and was like wow I barely got any sleep, it wasn\u2019t long enough\u201d. I respond with \u201cmy fault\u201d and he doesn\u2019t say anything. \n\nAlso I am calorie counting to lose weight, so I said to him \u201cI found out that donating plasma burns around 500 calories!

He does this crap ALL the time.

Has he also been isolating you from friends and family? Keeping you from getting an education, or being financially independent? Because deliberately being malicious like this is no accident and NOT what a normal relationship sounds like. Doesn't matter if he's saying you're upset over nothing. What's a flat-out fact is that a normal person does not say the things he's saying or react like he does.

My family is notorious for these kinds of \"jokes.\"  Toxic as hell, and there is a meanness underneath it all that is passive-aggressively degrading you.", "NTA he's passive aggressive and cruel", "NTA He is gaslighting you said you don't like it several times and he keeps doing it  \ud83d\ude10", "Oh fuck all those \"jokes\".\n\nNta", "NTA - he\u2019s being a dick", "He's not joking. He's being passive-aggressive. Dude is acting like a major jackass. NTA", "NTA\n\nCruelty is often downplayed as comedy and the victim is gaslighted into believing it's their fault for \"taking it wrong\".\n\nHe is an emotionally abusive asshole. \n\nI'm sorry you're being treated this way.", "I mean. If he thinks those are jokes he needs to get a better sense of humor because neither are funny. The first was passive aggressive as all get out and a smile while saying the second is condescending.

For a proper roast to be funny, you have to know the person well enough to recognize their flaws while also understanding where the boundaries are of what is and isn\u2019t okay to poke fun at.  It makes it clear that you know the person, can laugh with them about their flaws/aren\u2019t hung up on them, and can be comfortable with each other.\n\nBut he\u2019s not doing that.  He\u2019s just being rude, because he\u2019s ignoring the boundaries of what is funny and what\u2019s insulting.

I've said things that were \"meant\" as a joke, but had underlying truth, ignoring that the person I was speaking to may be sensitive about it.

Other commenters are correct about this being passive AGRESSIVE. Remember passive aggressiveness is a form of aggression.\n\nHe gets gratification from being abusive and then tricking you into believing it's a joke. Some people are disordered and this is one of the ways they get their kicks. The problem is, each time he does this, he devalues you a little in his own mind. At some point he's just going to walk off looking for greener pasture or escalate the abuse. \n\nIt's unfortunate that you made a child WITH HIM, not that you made a child in general. Before long he's going to be playing all the same shitty games with your child that he plays with you.

Absolutely zero tolerance on being told what you \"can\" or are allowed to eat. \n\nI've heard some great advice: Either call ppl out and say \"What did you mean by that?\" or ignore the tone entirely and treat them like they're sincere (refuse to take a hint or read between the lines) until they communicate directly. \n\nBut no, it will never get better.", "NTA, your partner is being very passive aggressive.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not crazy.
