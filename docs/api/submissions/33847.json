{"id": 33847, "submission_id": "18s1qbm", "title": "AITA for not letting my old MIL stay with us over Christmas even though she lives alone?", "selftext": "I\u2019m 41, my husband is 47, we have a 5yr old daughter. My husband\u2019s mom is 72, she has some mobility issues but overall she\u2019s fine health-wise. She lives alone, her husband passed away quite suddenly last year. We live about 2 hours away from her by car, so my husband visits her sometimes on weekends but not that often. \n\nI\u2019ve never had a good relationship with her, she made some insensitive comments when I miscarried and has always said that my job isn\u2019t a real job, and I should \u201cpull my weight\u201d in the family. I teach music lessons online, I don\u2019t earn as much as my husband (who works a regular corporate job) but I do make a good chunk of the family income, so it\u2019s not just a hobby. I\u2019m also home with my daughter, which is a lot of work too\u2026 anyways. When my FIL passed my MIL took it pretty hard, I suppose it sunk in that she\u2019s wasn\u2019t as independent as she was in the past. She asked if she could move in with us, but I didn\u2019t want her to because it would honestly just be miserable to have her around all day. \n\nMy husband wasn\u2019t really happy but he told her if she gets older and needs help, she can move in with us. For thanksgiving this year we went to my parents\u2019 house, and she was upset about it, so she called during dinner and she was crying that she was alone. Later I said that she did that just to screw up our evening, and my husband said I was being cold and heartless. She asked if she could stay with us for Christmas and New Years, and I told my husband that she was absolutely not coming here. He got really angry and we both said some thoughtless things. He thinks I\u2019m just holding grudges and being cruel to leave an old lady alone during the holidays, and his mother on top of that. We were both just pretending everything was fine on Christmas so our daughter would enjoy it like usual. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the problem.\n\nEdit- We did visit her on Christmas Eve and will visit again for New Years. I just didn\u2019t want her to stay for the whole two weeks. \n\nEdit #2: it\u2019s not the first holiday season since her husband passed. Last year she was with us for a few months after he passed, during the holidays as well. She insisted I cook every meal for her separately, since my daughter doesn\u2019t like spicy food we have gotten used to more mildly spiced food, and she didn\u2019t like that. Once she left, we went to the beach for the weekend and she called saying she was very sick. We headed home straight away and it turns out she wasn\u2019t sick at all. I know I\u2019m being selfish but I just don\u2019t want to deal with it again. \n\nEdit #3: husband isn\u2019t an only child. His brother lives in Australia, though, which is kind of an issue\u2026 we are in the US. He says he will help pay if she needs to go to a nursing home later, though.

She was mean to you, and now she wants you to put her up and wait on her hand and foot? Hard pass. If your husband wants to play host and take off work while she's there and do all the cooking and extra work fine. You can go visit your family, or do something else. He's only so insistent because he knows it wouldn't cost him any time or effort of his own.", "ESH.\n\nBoth of these things can be true. You don't enjoy your MIL's company, but she is actually lonely and still dealing with the death of her husband. It wouldn't hurt to be a little more kind to her. \n\nWhy not move her closer to you guys? Or set her up at a hotel in your town for the holidays. That we she's just a few minutes away and able to visit/have visitors, but she's not directly under your feet in your home.", "YTA.  You are fortunate enough to have your own family, but you are being unbelievably selfish and cruel. Being alone at the holidays is soul crushingly hard and cruel for the elderly.  Are all family relationships perfect?  No.  Are you required to have your MIL live with you permanently?  No, but that's a big conversation between you and your husband.  But a few days over Christmas is a different matter entirely.  Is it an asshole move to exclude her during Christmas?  Yes.  Have a little compassion.", "NTA. You have a husband problem instead of a MIL problem. \n\nYou need to block her from your phone. She can call him. He can deal with her. She\u2019s HIS problem. If he would like to see her at Xmas or New Year\u2019s or spend two weeks with her, he can. \n\nYou\u2019re out. She\u2019s not your family. She\u2019s made that abundantly clear. So, make some ground rules for your husband. He can choose to call and see her as much as he wants and you will do your own thing. \n\nHe can be honest with her and tell her that she burnt the bridge and you\u2019re out, but he won\u2019t. As someone who has implemented this in my own life, I can tell you, he\u2019ll most likely make excuses for why you can\u2019t make it every time, but that\u2019s on him, not you. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly freeing. \n\nHe should have had your back and set boundaries with her before, but he let you bear the brunt of her crappy comments and allowed her to treat you like shit. So, this is his consequence.", "NTA after reading edits. It's clear now that MIL has used manipulation and guilt tactics to get what she wants. You have opened up your home to her previously and she bit the hand that fed her. You can only do that so many times before the person stops offering you a hand.\n\nYou and your husband need to get on the same page. See a counselor if you can together. Maybe you two can come up with a compromise for her. Why can she stay in a hotel when she visits? Her being in your home and dictating your activities is not healthy for your marriage so find an alternative both of you can live with.", "You must really hate this lady to be so cruel but I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt. NTA.", "I'm torn here, I think you could have found a happy medium here. like maybe let her stay over for EITHER Christmas eve and take her home on Christmas night OR NYE to New Years Day, I also think it would have been nice for you to invite her to your parents for Thanksgiving - our family says anyone is welcome so a lot of my cousins' in-laws join, one extra person wouldn't ruin anything.\n\nShe is alone now and miserable and the more you try to keep her at arms length, the more resentful she will be towards you and she will complain quietly to your husband about it all, which inevitably will get in his head. Try to find more small compromises with her to keep her happy, she is his mother and they do have a relationship, so we do have to make sacrifices sometimes.\n\nShe sounds kind of awful, but such is life! Good luck!", "NTA \n\nYou need to have a serious talk with your husband about how his kosher treats you and how that affects how you react to her in your own house that you help pay for.\n\nShe should not expect you to be her servant and do everything for her.\n\nIf husband wants her to stay then he is going to need to be there for her or arrange some care for her and not expect or assume that you will take over without consulting you about any decisions that involve you. He wants her there, and then he needs to be there to take care of her.\n\nThere is also the matter of him being dismissive of how you feel and what you want, so marriage counseling should also be a consideration.", "YTA.  She shouldn't be alone on Thanksgiving or other holidays when she just lost her life partner. You are cold and cruel.", "Have her get an apartment near you.", "I see a future where your son and his wife treat you as miserably as you treat her", "NTA. As someone who spent the last 18 years with my MIL part of our household, my advice is if you have any hesitation at all (which you clearly do) you should not move her in with you. Let your husband and his brother come up with a solution, and as others have said, find neutral ground like therapy to discuss this issue with your husband. Sooner than later, because she is one fall or illness away from living in your guest room.", "Yes, your MIL has said insensitive things that hurt you and acted poorly. Now is your chance to set appropriate boundaries with her (how long she can stay, if you'll cook a separate meal), and then show her And your husband kindness by not excluding her over the Holliday. This is a time for graciousness, kindness, and forgiveness. \n\nYou could easily show your husband you care about his feelings and set a good example for your own child about boundaries and forgiveness... instead you're choosing to be rigid, controlling, and honestly cruel imo. YTA", "NTA  Huge NTA.  I am an older GenX woman. I have no living children, but old doesn\u2019t make nice.  I see older people abusing their adult children all the time and then wondering why they have no relationship with them. While I am not saying had MIL been nicer, you should let her stay with you, I am saying, maybe visits could actually be pleasant.\nWhy should your holidays be ruined by bad behavior?", "NTA if she \"stays for the holidays\" she will never leave. Tell your husband: you have a right not to have people that treat you like garbage in your home.", "NTA, But if your husband thinks you are that's all that matters. This is a good opportunity to compromise and maybe fix the dynamic between your family and MIL. If fighting about her is going to ruin your holiday season, she may as well be there in person to ruin things and then you can say I told you so and have further evidence why her living with you wouldn't work. It would give you a chance to set stronger boundaries now that she doesn't have the upperhand. \n\nIf she really needs to move and cant be on her own in the future my suggestion is an assisted living facility near you so you can visit but not have to see her every single day. Obviously thats later down the line but you need to plan ahead if living with you is what her and your husband have in mind.", "Write a list of all the events your MIL has caused. Show it to your husband. Explain that if she moves in, he will be cooking all the meals for her because you will be moving out.\n\nNTA.\n\nHer being lonely is a function of her being unpleasant.", "Nta\n\nFind a compromise early for next year holidays. Like only 3 days or staying in a nearby hotel, etc", "NTA. Your husband needs to set reasonable limits and boundaries with her, and reasonable compromises with you. She needs to work on being kinder and developing some friendships. And they both need to work on the idea of you as the caretaker. \n\nThere is a world of options between her being all alone 2 hours away, and her moving into your home. There is a world of options between spending no time with her on the holidays and her staying with you for 2 weeks straight. It sounds like she's used to getting what she wants and he's used to that too, and they need to work on a re-negotiation of how their adult relationship can work in a way that doesn't put it all on your shoulders.", "You don\u2019t have a MiL problem, you have a husband problem.\n\nYour husband and you have to be on the same page with regard to your household (who comes and goes, for how long, who cares for them, etc.)! In this instance the two of you clearly are not. Importantly, this is not a question of \u201cshe was mean to me, I don\u2019t want her here\u201d, but a question of getting stuck indefinitely with a needly and lonely roommate, when you are the one working from home, while your husband is away most of the day.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to dump on you the day in-day out dealings with her on you \\*even if you were on the best of terms\\* with your MiL!\n\nSince your husband is trying to dump the responsibility - and the guilt for his mother\u2019s condition - on you, it might be better to seek some sort of impartial mediation? Like, several visits to a couples\u2019 therapist?", "NTA", "YTA for making this your hill to die on. Suggest hubby find her a nice senior apartment nearby. She doesn't have to live WITH you if she lives NEAR you. Hubby and your child can spend time with her regularly and you only need to deal with her infrequently. It will also help her build her OWN social circle so she isn't so lonely.\n\nIt costs you nothing to be kind and thoughtful. Being mean and holding a grudge against a lonely older person could cost you the nice lifestyle you have. Be smart about this and go to your husband with positive, workable solutions that make everyone happy.", "NTA and its concerning that your husband thinks you are cruel for not letting her stay as a response to HER cruelty toward you. You should both do marriage counseling", "YTA move her closer to you. Apt or Condo. Where you can drop in regularly. Ignore the comments cause she\u2019s old. Find a senior center near by for her to visit.  If comments gets too bad point out a nursing home is a lot worse then her current situation.", "NTA - she should go into an old folks home", "NTA\n\nMIL or not, you have a say in who you want in your home.  From your edit, MIL staying in your house for months was a glaring example of what her living there full time would look like.  Take that for what it is, but see it as a blessing in disguise that you actually did live the situation.  \nThat would be a point to raise with your husband.  \n\nAnother point to bring up is that if she is lonely, a retirement community where she can socialize with others would be helpful for her.  By no means, though, should you compromise the peaceful home life that you have.  With her being elderly, at some point she is going to need care.  Make it clear to your husband that you are not equipped to be a home care nurse should it come to that, so the best option is a retirement community like I mentioned above.\n\nLastly, I will leave you with this story I previously put on here about my co-worker.  The short version is that her husband moved his elderly, widowed, and barely mobile father into their family home.  Her husband just did it without her input and they already had five children.  \n\nFor the next five years, she served as the nurse to her father-in-law while her husband worked.  My co-worker was a stay at home mom, however, she had the added responsibility of a man who was very overweight and had growing medical needs.  She bathed, brought this man to the bathroom, and fed him.  Her husband never tended to the needs of his OWN father.  One day, she broke her father-in-law's fall and injured her ankle.  She told her husband this was becoming too much for her and that they needed to find a home care nurse.  He refused.\n\nAccording to my co-worker, she was very relieved when her father-in-law's condition got to the point where he needed to be put in the hospital.  She admitted that she didn't know how to act that she didn't have to keep an ear out for him to call out that he needed her.  She could finally rest.\n\nHe passed shortly after and that's when my co-worker went out and got a job.  Her husband tried moving an uncle into the house \"for her to take care of\" and protested when she told him that she could not, and would not, do so because now she had a job.", "Not to be alarmist, but this exact situation was the end of my parents\u2019 marriage.  They are still married, but they hate each other.  Get some counseling now before it\u2019s too late.  NTA, but i imagine any solution to this is going to include a fair amount of compromise on the part of both you and your husband.", "NTA, and you should point out to your husband there's nothing stopping him from going to stay with her and even taking your daughter with him if he's concerned. \n\nYou need to make your boundaries about her living with you known, as otherwise he will move her in and then you will likely be expected to be her carer.", "Don't let that angry mean old bag live with you. Fuck her. Keep your boundaries and get couples therapy to get you two to talk about it more. Don't cave in.", "NTA\n\nAssisted living, she\u2019ll be around people her age.", "Nta\n\nPeople forget that actions/words have consequences, and they absolutely forget that they'll be old at some point and will face those consequences when it's inconvenient to them.\n\nShe can cry in her pillow for the repercussions of her choices when she was mobile.\n\nAnd tell your husband that she was mocking the miscarriage of his child too. He can move in with her, and pay for two households cuz that's what will end up happening.", "YTA. Ever heard of compromise? Marriage is a partnership. You two need to sit down and have an honest conversation. Sure, I can understand that you don\u2019t want her living there but she is still his mom so she\u2019s still going to be in his life. If he was the type of person to abandon her then you wouldn\u2019t want to be married to someone like that.", "NTA. MIL cannot expect to treat someone badly for such a long time, and then expect favours from them.", "NTA. I send my husband over to his parents place if they need something. I absolutely do not agree or allow for them to stay with us and I don\u2019t want them building a habit of it. \n\nAt the moment, my husband goes over to help his parents out, visit etc. Even if it means that weekend I won\u2019t be seeing my husband that\u2019s fine. I have to compromise somewhere. Usually one weekend a month or less my husband would be away", "Weaponized femininity again. There needs to be a convo 1000%. I've learned over time, that if you draw a hard line with your husband's family,  he's gonna draw thr same with yours. Is the battle worth the war?", "NTA you and your husband need to get into marriage counseling. Why does she have to move into your space why can\u2019t she move nearby?  Has she ever taken accountability for her treatment of you? Does your husband acknowledge her actions and its impact on you?\n\nYou don\u2019t like each other and that\u2019s okay. It would be miserable for your daughters to live with that.", "NTA - You aren't \"holding old grudges.\" she is still the same person she was back then. If she moves in, you won't just be a roommate but expected to serve her hand and foot.", "ESH.\n\nYour mother-in-law is not a nice person, and is directing much of it towards you: the comments about your miscarriage and your job, telling you to \"pull your weight,\" demanding you cook separate meals, calling and pretending to be ill or crying about being alone on Thanksgiving when you were with your family.  She knows she can manipulate your husband, and she does it well.\n\nYour husband should not have told his mother she could move in with you when she gets older and needs more help without first talking to you about it.  You work from home and raise your daughter, so most of the care-giving would fall on your shoulders.  He also doesn't seem likely to set and enforce boundaries with hi mother either.  And he has already pledged to financially support her if she needs to be in a nursing home, and possibly did so without consulting you.  He also doesn't understand why you feel the way you do about his mother.  Your husband also needs to listen to your feelings about this situation.\n\nFinally, while I understand how frustrated and angry you are, you need to accept that your MIL is not going to change, and if you want to stay with your husband, you need to find a way to deal with her being in your life.  You need to have a serious, calm discussion with your husband about why you do not want his mother moving in, and set forth the reasons that it would be difficult for you. Be willing to find ways to compromise where you can - moving her closer to you, finding a senior living community that fits her needs, etc.  You may need to have these conversations in the presence of a therapist to help you work through them.  Then you may need to decide whether or not to stay with your husband if he is unwilling to compromise on matters relating to his mother.\n\nOne final note: agreeing to support his mother if she goes into a nursing home may not be a good idea for you financially.  Doing so can limit the amount of financial assistance/Medicaid his mother would be entitled to.  I just went through something similar with my husband's cousin - we were trying to get her Medicaid qualified because she needed skilled nursing care, and she had to spend down much of her savings.  Skilled nursing in my area is close to $500 per day.  It might be a good idea to talk with an attorney that specializes in elder law and estate planning.", "NTA, its great that your husband wants to take care of her. But living with someone is a fucking big deal. It may have been possible once upon a time but she fucked that up royally by being an asshole in the past.\n\nConsider moving somewhere where you can get a 'granny' annex or moving her closer to where you live perhaps. But under the same roof it is perfectly reasonably here to say no.", "YTA. You\u2019re spiteful. It\u2019s his mom. She should be allowed to visit. Moving in is a different story. It\u2019s the holidays \u2026 we\u2019re all suppose to be nice to one another.", "NTA. You are not her retirement plan, especially if she has been nasty and manipulative in the past. SO can not unilaterally invite her to move in with you. If she needs/desires an alternate living situation then maybe she can look at a condo or smaller place closer to where you live so your SO can help her more easily.", "NTA\n\nBut I wonder how much of these are problems with my mother-in-law and how much of them are problems with your husband. In most cases, the bigger problem is with your SO who should stand behind you and support you in any situations that arise fights with your mother-in-law, be the wall on which she effectively stops and who is not.", "NTA\nMaybe the conversation could have went differently, but my husband and I are already in agreement that neither of our moms can live with us. Our marriage and our sanity would never survive. I totally understand where you're coming from.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a husband problem. Your husband has been letting his mother insult you and treat you like a servant. He needs to open his mouth and tell his mother that you aren't a servant, you are the lady of the house and she is a guest. \n\nSecondly, he was way out of line to offer for her to move in with you without your approval. No, no, no - especially after the way she's treated you!\n\nDon't cook any special meals for her going forward. Put some spices in front of her place setting and let her add her own spices - you aren't a hired chef.", "NTA.", "NTA. \nI suspect your husband doesn\u2019t understand everything you did in the few months she was with you before, because I\u2019m doubting he did any of it. These two weeks would likely have been a trial run for him since he\u2019s already made promises.\n\nIf she does move in, she will need more and more help as she ages and that will come down to you. Being a caregiver is a hard job and I suspect you\u2019d still be working during it. My sister was our mother\u2019s caregiver and my sister wasn\u2019t even working and it just sucked the life out of her.\n\nI would go to couples therapy. If he wants his mom to move in, he needs to take an active role.", "YTA\n\nShe's his mother and she lives 2 hours away. There aren't 2 weeks between New Years and Christmas. There's one. It's perfectly understandable that he wants his mother to visit for one week so she isn't alone. It's also a dick move to not ask your mother if she could come with you to her house on Thanksgiving. I take my mother in law to my aunt's house every thanksgiving she's here because that's just common goddamn courtesy since she's alone.\n\nYou're holding childish grudges over your husband's mother and it will not end well for you to be this way.", "NAH\n\nYou need to get on the same page with your husband. Or you aren't compatible. It won't work if he expects you to take care of his mother and you don't want to.", "NTA. Look into senior living facilities closer to where you are. Then you both still have your own homes and day visits would be more feasible for holidays. It would give your husband peace of mind having her closer, and put off any moving in with your family ideas.", "YTA and you're petty too.  I hope when you're 72 you end up all alone and have no one.   Go ahead hold grudges and be insensitive to everyone around you because you're selfish.  You'll end up alone and miserable to and you'll damn well deserve it.", "NTA. This is karma, a case of \u201cchickens coming home to roost.\u201d MIL was rude and disrespectful to you when she was younger and healthier, but now that she is older and lonely, she expects your compassion? Has she even apologized to you for her past behavior? Until she apologizes, I think your feelings and actions are justified. And this should be a lesson to everyone who thinks it\u2019s okay to be intentionally mean to your son/daughter-in-laws when they\u2019ve done nothing to deserve it. Now I will say this\u2026you may want to consider marriage counseling because I believe this topic will continue to come up in your marriage.", "ESH I\u2019m not discounting her behaviour and your feelings about her but she is your husband\u2019s mother and it would be good for your relationship with him to have empathy and acceptance around the fact that he doesn\u2019t want to abandon her during the holidays. He also needs to do a better job taking your feelings into account and find a compromise\u2014maybe move her closer to you so he can spend more time with her. There is so much pain and suffering in this world maybe a little forgiveness is in order here", "Your husband told his mother that she could move in without consulting you, Knowing that she treats you like crap? He would be divorced and broke very quickly if it were me in your shoes.", "Look around and see if there are Senior Day Care places.  If she moves in she could go there during the day and make friends and be out of your way.  Don't give in to ridiculous requests like special meals.  I keep my food separate and cook separately because my DiL cooks with too much grease for me.  We've had a rocky road, but we've worked it out.  Good luck!", "I could never live with my MIL. I don't blame you. But you should go to counseling to have the discussion in a neutral space.", "NTA\n\nMind, I have a feeling that if she \"visits\" for two weeks, they might be the most elastic two weeks ever once she gets her foot in the door...\n\nThis issue will only get bigger. You both need a mediator to discuss it.", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds like a bit of an arsehole, she made comments when you miscarried, which is despicable.\n\nDepending on what those comments were, your husband should have potentially cut her off from the family, screw this whole blood is thicker than water crap.\n\nEither way, I think we can all feel for her being alone but you reap what you sow and she has sewn the seed of shittiness with you.\n\nIf you own your own home and you do decide do let her move in, maybe it would be worth considering having an annex built using the money from the sale of her house, this way you can both have independence.\n\nThere is the subject of your husband and the loss of his father, but that doesn't mean a life of misery for you just because he's mourning.\n\nI think it's not a possibility to move her in, she will be too demanding by the sound of it and pretending to be ill in order to make you come home from a trip removes all trust you can have with her.\n\nStrong NTA.", "I think your husband is in a difficult spot.

She sounds full of red flags, very entitled and controlling and given that it does not sound like you are on the same page as your husband you have to get on top of this immediately! I'd suggest counselling as a first step.", "NTA\n\n>My husband wasn\u2019t really happy but he told her if she gets older and needs help, she can move in with us.\n\nYikes. That's going to be an issue down the road. \n\n\n>I just didn\u2019t want her to stay for the whole two weeks. \n\n2 weeks is totally unreasonable. It sucks that your MIL is up the creek and yall will be left holding the bag. That doesn't change the fact that she has been rude and insensitive in the past.", "NTA\n\nThe most important thing to address first is your husband promising MIL she can move in with you if she needs help when older. It doesn't sound like you agreed that?\n\nIt will likely fall to you to be the carer which could include all aspects of personal care.

You may even come home one day to him already having your mil moved in. \n\nYou need to state what your boundaries are for the future and what you are not willing to compromise about.

And if he ultimately chooses to value his mother's comfort in your home over your own, you will have minimized your burden as you decide how you want to handle your husband's dismissiveness of your wellbeing.", "This is good advice that needs to be taken ASAP. This woman is one slip in the shower away from moving in for round the clock care- and OP is the person at home most of the time, so guess who'll get the joys of doing most of the care-taking!", "If his mom moved in it would be the OP doing most of the help for mom. She'd be the one doing the laundry and cooking the extra side dinner and taking his mom to doctor's appointments, etc.\n\nMarriage counseling is a must here.", "exactly. some people really make me appalled . that's his old mom regardless and is alone. it sucks being old and alone and being treated like this. ofc old people say shxt, it can be really annoying. My own MIL said some stuff abt me to my husband and we got into fights bcs of it...but We dont live together so it works. I let my issues aside and learn to co exist in peace whenever we do meet. for my husbands sake and inherently mil is not a bad person. just a different generation and opinions. I live as I please in my house. a few days out of the year I can smile and be nice. Now living together is a different story and no way I'd be ok with that", "The person who is being abused shouldn\u2019t have to be the person working towards a compromise. It\u2019s his mother. He can go to her house and spend time with her. He can bring his kid. He can call her and make plans with his mom. His mother, his problem. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to be a part of that relationship at all. His mother would clearly be happier with that arrangement as well. \n\nGuarantee he just wants his wife there so she can do all the work.", "A yes and a no make it a no.  This is THEIR house.  Not just his.  They both have to live there, and they both pay bills/contribute to the household.", "Her examples of being treated poorly are fucking bullshit. They are normal everyday family issues. Her 5 y/o sure as hell is learning a lot right now. On how to tell her own mother to fuck off one day.", "I think it honestly depends a lot on the parent. If my mom needed help, I'd be happy to live with her. My dad, on the other hand, died alone because he burned every bridge he ever had. My BIL could probably live with his dad, but not with his mom. But even in these situations, the parent probably needs additional help than even their offspring can provide. But being able to afford home help is a rare privilege, unfortunately.", "They did visit on Christmas Eve. This MIL won't be satisfied until she's the center of every holiday.", "They offered to visit her on Christmas Eve she wants to come for two weeks, that\u2019s excessive especially when you treat your dil poorly.", "I can see why op won\u2019t agree to letting her stay even for a little while. If the husband has already promised to let her live with them in the future with out consulting op she may be afraid the mil will never leave if she comes to visit.", "He can visit her. She\u2019s his mother. She has burned the bridge with OP.", "I hosted my entire BIL family for Thanksgiving,  along with my Inlaws and my parents.  I can't imagine OPs parents would tell MIL she can't come to Thanksgiving.  It's cruel to leave her entirely alone on a holiday.", "How will you handle that? She could live with you for 20 years or more. If you can\u2019t handle a holiday visit, then you need to figure out the future. Who will help her bathe, use the toilet, dress and be with her? She needs emotional care now. You can just shut her out and hope your marriage will survive. If you are unhappy with her living with you, then make plans now to move into assisted living closer to your home or something similar. I wish you all the best.", "I agree once a month is good.  I said every weekend \"if need be.\"  That means UP TO every weekend if his mother needs that much help.  Shopping, housekeeping, yard work.\n\nWhat you're missing is that the alternative is for her to come live with them, which will be a MUCH BIGGER disruption to OP's family than husband or husband+kids or whole family visiting MIL a few times a month.", "I took a job with a 2-hour commute each way for a year+.   I did it to FEED my family.\n\nIf Husband doesn't want his mother to be lonely, he can visit. Or take the kids and visit. And it doesn't have to be every weekend.  But that's the way for him to make a difference in his mother's life without burdening his wife.", "Honestly depends where you live. In Europe a two hour drive is like a cross country road trip. In the states it\u2019s like going to Costco.", "A sacrifice op seems willing to allow her husband to make in order to not have her mil full time.", "My uncle was always a social guy. The place he moved into was great. Moving in with his son and DIL would have been lonely for him because they both work long hours. He also was always kind and appreciative to his DIL unlike OP's MIL.", "Sounds like OP is treating her husband pretty badly by excluding his mother. Does that mean he shouldn't tolerate OP anymore?", "Badly - the examples are insensitive comments about a miscarriage - coming from a woman in her late 60's, who grew up in a time when such things weren't even discussed. OP classified as \"insensitive comment\" because it was just that. It wasn't something horrible enough that she could use it as part of her \"case.\" And the fact that she doesn't think teaching music online is a \"real job.\" No one her age does. I am closer to OP's age & I barely think it's a real job. (For reference, I actually have a ridiculous job that should not be a real job.)", "Your cousin left his wife and children and never came back after two weeks of a nasty MIL? He was ready to leave long before his \"fishing trip\".", "According to OP. \n\nMIL: Your job isn't a real job (and, in her defense, it is a job that literally did not exist when she was her DIL's age)\n\nOP: Spend Thanksgiving alone and I'll make snide remarks when you cry about it to your child whose wife excluded you.\n\nOne of these things is more harsh than the other.", "Why? Not arguing just curious?\n\nObviously they have very different ideas of how their future and family looks like. They need to get on the same page and be very honest about it.\n\nCounseling isn\u2019t for when the marriage is broken. It\u2019s to help keep the marriage from becoming broken beyond repair. It\u2019s to give you tools to help see the other persons side and not just dismiss them. \n\nBut I would love to know why you don\u2019t think it would work.", "My dad and my step mom both have their mothers at Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.", "For some maybe but my mom and mil hated each other. It was to the point we had separate birthday parties for the kids.\n\nPlus it isn\u2019t fair for op not to enjoy the time she gets with her parents. If mil makes op uncomfortable which is the situation she deserves to enjoy Christmas too.\n\n\nAlthough I understand where you\u2019re coming from but sometimes what your suggesting isn\u2019t possible. \n\nAnd not to take up for op but I would not want my mil or mom to leave with us. This is a strain on the best of marriages even when the older person is a saint (which in this case it doesn\u2019t sound like mil is). \n\nMaybe the best suggestion is for op to let her husband spend time with his mom at her house. Go when she can but the husband needs to prioritize ops feelings and not down play what his mom does. Until he makes it clear to mommy no disrespectful or negative comments will be tolerated mil will continue to be rude to op.", "It would be nice if OP\u2019s MIL plays well with others. There\u2019s a chance she would ruin mutual gatherings by pouting because she has to share.", "This is excellent advice! Of course he doesn\u2019t mind\u2014she isn\u2019t bullying him!", "OP\u2019s husband could be one of the many who think \u201cwork from home\u201d means \u201crelaxation and play all day!\u201d", "Yes, I notice OP's husband is promising his mother she can move in but it's OP who had to cook all the extra meals...", "This is a good point also. Even if op agreed\nTo let her move in (which I doubt she would) she needs to make it perfectly clear to her husband she will not be mils caretaker. That their daughter will not miss having a normal life growing up. And the husband needs to have a solid plan on who will take care of his mom so op and the daughter are not burden with taking care of her.", "Oh definitely! Her husband doesn't see a problem with mommy dearest moving in because it wouldn't inconvenience HIM. HE wouldn't be going the extra work to support his mom, so HE doesn't see a problem with it \ud83d\ude11", "Oh, no, not a moral right or anything of that sort. I'm talking about how the law works, and the law allows you to move somebody in, assuming you don't exceed occupancy laws. (Though the place would be trashed and you'd lose your insurance long before the government forced people out)\n\nIf I move back in with my mom, even without paying rent, I can then move somebody else in. A good person wouldn't, but they'd just be a person subletting from the sublessee. Literally the reason to not live with people you do not trust and a part of the reason landlords want everybody on the lease.", "If this is your idea of normal family issues, I feel sorry for your family.", "Being old doesn't excuse being an asshole, she MIL has disrespected OPs job, role in in the family and was hurtful instead of supporting at a miscarriage. It is 100% perfectly reasonably to not want to have someone like that near you.", "I\u2019m not OP. I was speculating on the question you asked. Anyways OP is not open to any sort of together living arrangement with her MIL.", "My comment is specifically replying to the person saying he can visit every weekend and that a 2 hour commute is not far.", "I\u2019m in Chicago\u2026..45 min to get across the city. Two hours is a long drive at least for me living in a big city.", "When you\u2019re doing work for money, it\u2019s a job. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s for a company or if you\u2019re a freelancer - it\u2019s a job.\n\nWhen an in-law is awful to you, you have no obligation to deal with them\u2026and you know OP\u2019s husband would offload all the caring responsibilities onto OP. They need to find a reasonable compromise that doesn\u2019t make OP\u2019s life a living hell - it\u2019s her home too.\n\nThere are enough retirement communities around, that should be the first step as it would give MIL a way to make friends and participate in social activities.", "It's more than just 2 weeks of a nasty MIL though, it's constant mental and emotional abuse from a MIL while his wife never stood up for him or defended him. On top of that, it's the fact that a major life-changing decision was made without so much as a heads up, which is a blatant disregard for his feelings. If any spouse does that to their SO, it's an immediate show of how little they care about their SO and how little they actually think of them. It's the perfect way of saying how little value their SO actually holds.", "Could be because the wife and mother were constantly up his ass! I met the woman and she was really something. I had a wonderful MIL so I figured he was full of it but he proved me wrong.", "Did you miss the part where the mil made comments about a miscarriage? That's about as low as you can get", "My take would be that if you have to arrange a specific meeting with a third party to discuss a matter, especially at this early stage, it can break down open dialogue between spouses.\n\nI get that some people need this sort of thing or they've tried talking things over for ages and just need some sort of change within the discussion, but I feel that reliance at an early stage means a reliance in the future, that simple discussion becomes to formal and is for a set date and time.\n\nSometimes people need to just blurt stuff out while they feel it in the moment, even if it means picking up the pieces a little bit after, it's about raw truth rather than what someone might feel like on the day if its a scheduled session.", "Your parents have to be saints. I honestly don\u2019t think there would be enough alcohol for me to do this.", "I agree. Plus like I said the fact that she thinks she is entitled to live with them is an issue. She comes for a few days chances are she will \u201cget sick\u201d. And have to stay longer. And longer will end up in op kicking her out or being stuck with her.", "You\u2019re looking to much into it, if the comment wa otherworldly or it happened a lot of times, op husband would\u2019ve stepped in", "She is 72! Not that old (I am 70). She can easily live another 20+ years. Doesn't she have any close friends or relatives beside her son and MIL? \nMaybe it is time for her to join any of the  many programmes offered for senior citizens. There is no need to be lonely.", "Yes, that was me.  I said no reason he can't visit every weekend, not that it has to be every weekend or nothing.  To be precise I should have said he \"may visit any weekend\".   \n\nI don't consider visiting relatives to be a \"commute\" and he could certainly drive up on Saturday and return on Sunday to break it up.  For all we know he may already be doing this once a month or so.", "Ah I live in rural Georgia so we drive 30 minutes to get to Walmart and sometimes we have to drive 2 hours for one of my daughter\u2019s appointments.", "If you were born after 1980, sure. But talk to anyone in your parents'/grandparents' generation and losses were a normal part of life that people didn't generally mourn or talk about. Babies born before 30 weeks died. That was it. It's a big generational difference so no, without knowing exactly what was said I can't fault an old lady for being an old lady.", "You make good points. Which is why I asked.\n\nI honestly believe some steps need to be taken. I don\u2019t think sweeping this under the rug until mil wants to move in and the discussion it would be a good idea."]}
