Is there a way that you can still keep him connected with the coach outside if the sport time? Like tell the coach that you son really looks up to him and your would love for him to have a male role model since his dad is gone and so maybe they can schedule a regular hang out time together? That might end up being better anyway because your son would get more personal 1-on-1 time with him. \n\nObviously the coach might be super busy but it's worth maybe asking. \n\nAt the end of the day though I don't think it's fair for you to pull your son out if he doesn't want to.

His emotional wellbeing/stable relationships, are far more important (especially now) than sporting success.  \nYou also want to unilaterally overrule him, despite his stated wish to stay?! So yet again, he would feel he has no control (over keeping relationships important to him). \n\nYou would also lose his trust, just when he's losing yet more important people around him. That's because you would show no understanding of how traumatic it is to children, to lose several important relationships within a MONTH of each other.\n\nYou're also sending him a message that you're giving up on him (in a sport he wants to continue, regardless of reason). Even though you apparently haven't tried other options. For example, you could easily sit down with the coaches, and come up with a plan that helps him progress better.\n\nAt his age, it's generally about the joining in, rather than whether you excel at the sport or not. Coaches can adapt teaching styles, set new (and achievable) goals for him in the class, etc. I don't know if it's because you're still traumatised yourself from the split. However, you're not thinking straight, and you need to get a sense of priorities here. \n\nYour son needs stability in his important relationships as a top priority.

Ideally, don't make him choose between the options; give him many avenues, let him make his choices, and be gracious when he makes decisions you didn't expect.", "If you think being in the class is negatively impacting his mental health, pull him out.

Haha jk", "I obviously don\u2019t know the entire situation, but the class may be a place where your son feels safe to express frustration & anger.

We had kids of every variety, some that made such ugly art their parents would literally leave it in the studio lol. Because it wasn\u2019t about the result, it was about being there and staying there for a whole class to socialize. Hes obviously adapting to a lot with his father leaving (esp traumatically) and this group might be a safe space for him with people who don\u2019t judge his frustration. Add onto that he\u2019s got friends with common interests, so I think this group is probably important for him socially. If you\u2019re concerned about his level of upset, it doesn\u2019t hurt to keep talking about it.

I still fought on the way to practice or competitions.\n\nI quit when I became a teenager as I wanted more free time, but those 7 years of showing up and going thru a practice, was a life lesson and gave me discipline and stamina. And I am forever grateful to my dance teacher. \n\n\nYou are missing the point on what your son is getting out of this. He doesn't have to be good at anything to practice and to continue to practice.

Well, judging by your comment on what you feed him, that's YOUR fault. You're feeding him way more calories than he's burning in class and most of it is highly processed and packed with sugar. You're feeding him diabetes, no wonder he's not losing weight. For his sake, please make time to prepare home cooked meals for him. With the majority of it being fresh vegetables with some protein, minimize that frozen stuff. Slices of orange for dessert or something.\n\nDo you even read what you're posting? You give him soft serve and candy for breakfast and follow it up with a bowl of carbs and sweetened cheese-flavored glue for lunch. What kind of... You're trolling. You've got to be trolling.", "I\u2019m guessing that the sport in question is a martial art, just based on the fact that you\u2019re participating together. I could definitely be wrong\u2014 apologies for assuming if so! But I have a little bit of BJJ training experience, and I\u2019m leaning on that in both that assumption and my train of thought for this response.\n\nIf your son isn\u2019t wanting to quit, I\u2019d say leave him in it, for two reasons. Firstly, and most importantly, the positive connection with this coach *and* the physical outlet he\u2019s getting out of the activity are both hugely beneficial tools for him right now. Truthfully, those factors alone are probably worth it, even if he doesn\u2019t learn anything significant.\n\nBut secondly, on the results/frustration point, if he\u2019s not discouraged, just give him time for things to click. It\u2019s honestly admirable for a kid of his age to stick it out for a year plus in an activity where they\u2019re not necessarily seeing success/improvement, and people take to martial arts (if this is indeed the sport being discussed) at very different rates. Things like spatial awareness and body control come much more naturally to some people that others; if he\u2019s not there yet but not wanting to quit, there\u2019s a very good chance it still clicks for him at some point in the future.\n\nNTA for considering it, but I think the best move for your son at this stage is to continue.\n\nTweaked phrasing for clarity.", "Context clues make me think Karate", "Did he say he's frustrated and angry, or did you infer that? People have different ways of presenting focus. And frustration isn't necessarily a bad thing or a reason to quit.

And you made him leave.\n\nWhats next on the list of taking things away from him and destroying his sense of control?", "YTA\n\nRespect what he wants for his extracurriculars.

Don't dismiss his feelings. They are valid.\n\nThat being said, can you find an club that is more focused on his main interest? Let him do both and let him decide if he wants to drop the sport. \n\nJust because he is frustrated and not seeing results, doesn't mean he should not feel those feelings and disappointment. It is not going to damage your kid if they are uncomfortable. They can actually learn valuable life lessons out of uncomfortable situations. It is not your job as a parent to insulate and avoid all negative feelings for your kid. As long as it is not traumatic like his coach yelling at and berating him infront of others, there is a learning opportunity here. \n\nIt is your job as a parent to help them navigate those feelings. He's not seeing results? What type of results? Is this something you could spend extra time with your kid outside of the practices practicing? Identify what is giving him difficulty and work on those things together. Don't just quit. You quit toxic things not uncomfortable things.", "People here are being ridiculous. From what you describe your son appears to be absolutely miserable during the class but when you discuss it, he expresses not wanting to let down the coach. He's just had a male figure leave him and so it's not a huge jump to understand why he might feel concern that he's letting down a different male figure, especially someone like a coach - which comes with a lot of other pressures including peer pressure. \n\nI think you're absolutely right to be concerned and considering if keeping him in is the right thing, although I don't think pulling him is necessarily the right thing to do right now. I think you just need to keep discussing all of these issues with him, explore how he feels about this coach in more depth and talk to him about the importance of not doing things that make us unhappy just to make someone else happy. Perhaps there are other ways he could engage with this coach? Does he do other classes or even personal training? Something that takes the pressure off your son a bit but still allows him to spend time with the coach?\n\nThis isn't about AHs. You're clearly a concerned parent, struggling with a difficult situation. Even if I don't agree with your proposal, it's coming from a place of love and concern so no arseholes here, in my view.\n\nETA I did just read your comment about his diet though and ffs, any parent who feeds their children that shit is an AH. Of course he's overweight and struggling if you're feeding him mcflurries for breakfast and then following up with high fat, high sugar, processed shit with no fresh fruit and veg or proper protein.

Maybe instead of pulling him out you can sit down and talk to him about setting realistic goals and how stuff like this takes time and effort. Maybe even bring the coach into the conversation and he can help set your son up to work toward what he wants. \n\nPulling him out of the sport is only going to make the weight thing worse. If he keeps going at it eventually he will lose weight, but it's probably not going to happen in the time he wants. \n\nQuestion: besides playing the sport do you also help him with diet and nutrition?
