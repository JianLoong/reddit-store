Despite that, I appreciate that my mom loves him, and I respect that he has treated her well in the 3 years they\u2019ve been together. \n\nHe just isn\u2019t my kind of guy. I find him very passive aggressive, obtuse, and he often makes sexist & racist remarks which I cannot abide by. He is not mean as much as he is ignorant, but I do find it incredibly draining being around him.\n\nThat being said, we\u2019ve always maintained a polite and civil relationship. I expect this is out of a mutual shared love for my mother. \n\nI recently had to move back in with my mum due to the cost of living crisis (UK based). I pay my own way, and help around the house. I never expect my mum nor her partner to do anything for me and I make sure to give them plenty of time with each other. \n\nToday, a friend who is leaving the neighbourhood brought us a small bouquet of flowers and a card as a parting gift. It was very sweet. I went to fetch a vase and started arranging the flowers.\n\nAs I\u2019m doing this, I notice that my mums partner is standing over me, watching me. This is something he often does, and it makes me very uncomfortable. I ignore him, and continue with my task.\n\nHe often makes passive aggressive comments while I\u2019m carrying things out. In this instance, I was arranging the flowers and he says \u201cdon\u2019t we have a bigger vase?\u201d \n\nI replied \u201cno.\u201d The bouquet was only small and the flowers would not have had enough support to stay arranged in a larger vase. I didn\u2019t have the mental energy in that moment to get into a discussion with him about it.\n\nHe exclaimed \"we do!\" and looked at me expectantly. I let my frustration get the better of me and asked \"why don't you go get it then?\"\n\nHe got very angry and stormed out. \n\nIt came out a lot ruder than I intended, and I apologised once he returned with the other vase. My mother (who was oblivious to the whole interaction) questioned why he had brought in another vase and told him we didn\u2019t need it. He said \u201cI\u2019ll just shut up then.\u201d \n\nHe accepted my apology for my rudeness, and we have restored our civility, but I do struggle with him and it\u2019s not like me to snap at someone like that. It makes me feel bad.\n\nI was in the wrong for being so rude, but AITA? Is anyone the asshole, or are we simply incompatible?\n\n**EDIT**\nThank you all for your responses. He\u2019s been a real bully towards me today - I had to remove a plug in air-freshener from the living room as I\u2019m terribly allergic, and he yelled \u201cjust stay up stairs then!\u201d when I told them, but I\u2019ve been ignoring him and not rising to it. I appreciate everything you said, I\u2019m looking to move out as soon as I\u2019m financially able.", "created_utc": 1667389389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk2ycw/aita_for_revealing_my_true_feelings_about_my_mums/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But don\u2019t tell your mom that you don\u2019t like him.  Unless something major happens between you two, it almost always makes the person cling to their relationship more and look at you as just being a jerk or trying to come between them.  Just try to limit interaction, which it seems you already do, and try not to think about how annoying he is.", "It appears that you have been giving some serious thought about this issue.   Which suggests that you are trying to cope with your feelings about him.   Sometimes we are just incompatible and there's nothing to be done about it.   Good for you that you took the high road and apologized for this incident.", "NTA you aren't going to get along with everyone you meet and being civil is the best you can do. Seeing this is the only time you have spoken up which really doesn't sound bad just shows the love you hold for your mother to maintain that relationship with him by apologizing. Don't beat yourself up, stuff like that happens to the best of us. It also sounds like you hold a high level of maturity to navigate your feelings regarding the situation.\n\nEdit: Also he sounds horrible to be around so the fact you can stand living with him and this is the worst you've done is astounding. Good luck and hopefully you can move out soon", "NTA, not everyone can be compatibile with eachother and It happens to accidentally sound rude", "NTA. Honestly though, this sounds like not a big deal at all. I can't believe you took your time to type that all out.", "NTA\n\nThat doesn't sound passive aggressive. That sounds straight-up aggressive sometimes. I would save up and get out of that situation whenever finances permit. He is generally hostile, racist, sexist and tries to lord over your household. That's a bully.", "NTA\n\nIt had nothing to do with him", "I don\u2019t think he knows that you revealed your true feelings about your mom\u2019s partner\u2026. As far as they know, you reacted negatively to someone lurking over your shoulder and giving advice when it wasn\u2019t his business and no one asked his opinion.  \n\nSince they don\u2019t know you find him obnoxious, you didn\u2019t reveal your inner feelings - you just snapped because he was being annoying and then apologized.  \n\nNTA - I\u2019m sorry, he sounds tiresome.", "NTA\n\nThis reads like a relatively minor incident. You're allowed to not like the guy.", "Nta, although perhaps for how you phrased that title. You didn't reveal anything: you just sort of low key snapped in one interaction. He seems like a person who micro manages and makes passive aggressive suggestions when something isn't up to how he wants it. That sounds exhausting in the least and you'd be better off avoiding him: if it is possible I'd move out as fast as I can.", "NTA.  What was he doing supervising a task you had under control in the first place and that had nothing to do with him anyway?  It wouldn\u2019t have been rude to call him out on *that*, much less point out that if he felt that strongly about the dang vase, *he* should do something about it.  \n\nNext time, don\u2019t apologize, or at least make sure it\u2019s *only* for your tone if you really do feel like you could\u2019ve gotten the point across with less snark.  And figure out how to quit walking on eggshells around this guy in general.  Again, if he\u2019s going to make an issue out of things that don\u2019t need to be an issue, let that be his problem.", "NTA. I think you're giving him way too much credit; his behavior is exhaustingly hostile and condescending. Completely inappropriate. If I were you I'd try hard to get out of there ASAP.", "NTA.\n\nTension with step-parents is extremely common. And it doesn't sound like he's making any kind of effort to let you live there in peace. Kinda seems like he's being a dick in the hopes that his bad attitude will cause you to move out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
