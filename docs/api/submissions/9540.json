She is not behaving like a mother, it seems she wants you to validate her trauma... that's not your job. You are the kid and you \"job\" is to grow and become a confident, content person, to persue your goals, to be a good person, to maybe find a partner and found a family if that's what you want to...

You were trying to hold her accountable and she responded by denying what she did and attacking you. You recorded her for justifiable reasons.

I spent years doing these types of things with my spouse (I didn't know he was a narcissist), and never made an inch of progress. We even did couples counseling and he's been seeing his own for a few years now. Zero change, because no matter what, he only views himself as right and everyone else is always wrong.\n\nWhat helped me a lot was learning more about narcissism (there are different kinds, I was unaware!), how to spot it, and best ways to protect myself from people like that.

There is a lot of good advice in the thread, but one thing jumps out at me...\n\n>   Mainly the arguments are about how she treated me while i was growing up and how what she did hurt me.\n\nHere's the thing...  you just can't control what other people do or think.  Making her admit that she wronged you is just not practical.  I would recommend you stop pushing the issue.  *You* know what went down, whether or not she admits it.", "Lol so trauma (according to her) is a contest, but you're just trying to win? You really can't win with this woman. Be grateful you are getting space. And not trying to be snarky, but you should look for therapy when you are away for college so you can start understanding that this woman is a toxic nightmare and you don't deserve the way she is trying to make that feel.", "Noo, you actually have to do this.

She is gaslighting you and using DARVO just as others have said. People like this don\u2019t change. It\u2019s time to start some therapy and begin the process of moving on.

I\u2019m going explain things cause I think it\u2019ll help with understanding how to deal with your mother. \n\n\nYou know how she started pacing and acting weird after you played the recording? It wasn\u2019t cause of her trauma. It was cause you finally caught her red handed. She couldn\u2019t deny anything, you had clear evidence. \nShe paced because the loss of control and being undeniably wrong gives narcissists deep anxiety. She paused\ncause she had to think how she was going to respond and make it your fault. \n\n\nWhich is exactly what she did. She made it all about you and how your actions are awful. She ignored her own bad behaviour. Narcissists are often guilty of the exact behaviours they accuse of their victims. She claims you view your relationship issues as a \u201cgame\u201d to \u201cwin.\u201dNope, SHE views them that way. And this time she \u201clost,\u201d so she threw a tantrum.   \n\n\nNarcissists can\u2019t admit to themselves that they can be wrong or imperfect. They have severe insecurities, so as a coping mechanism their brain has used extreme confidence to trick itself into thinking they are the total opposite of insecure. So they believe they\u2019re flawless and basically can\u2019t be any negative trait. \nWhen that\u2019s challenged their anxiety over feeling insecure makes it feel like they\u2019re dying. Their brain goes into offence mode and attacks the threat.\nSo they use every abusive and manipulative psychological tool to ensure they don\u2019t have to admit they\u2019re imperfect. \n\n\nI\u2019ll give you some advice. \nJust stop talking with her about her behaviour and treatment of you. She did it, you know that, and despite what she says, she knows that too. She will never admit it though. She will never apologize and she will never give you what you want. I know it sucks, but it is a futile effort that will just cause you more pain with no reward.\nLook up and use the \u201cGray Rock Method,\u201d with you mom. It will help stop the hours of arguing.

Some people have a hard time admitting that they are wrong, let alone apologizing for it. Even worse when they have their own recorded words to explain. Of course she doesn't like to be recorded because she knows it can always be used against her. Your mother doesn't want consequences for anything she says. You, yourself, don't have a problem being recorded because I am sure you stand by everything you say, it isn't just her being recorded.", "You\u2019re NTA. Your mom is. Reading your post is like reading a script from my own life. My mom is like this and I recorded her on the day that I moved out when she was flying off the handle and verbally abusing my brother bc she didn\u2019t have power over me anymore. I recorded her behavior and sat on it for a while. We did therapy bc I thought it could be fixed and when I played the recording it was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Screaming and crying, how dare you, you recorded me without my permission. All of this was to deflect from the greater issue: her behavior and abuse that I could finally prove. She got combative and cruel, to scare me into submission. The therapist tried to explain to her but it fell on deaf ears. I wronged her and that was all that mattered. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve walked away from her and I feel worlds better.

For the time being, you probably need to let go of the hope that she'll come around and acknowledge the hurt she's caused you and the wrong she's done. Make your priority figuring out how to safely coexist with her for as long as you have to before you leave, and how to manage your relationship after that, not with the goal of reconciling with her but just minimizing conflict and opportunities for her to hurt you further.\n\nAt some point in the future, when you have more distance and independence, when you have a support network that can ground you when she's trying to convince you your memories never happened, and can engage with her on your terms (and walk away when you need to), you might be able to talk to her about some kind of therapy or counseling. (It may not be a good idea - you'd want professional advice first.) Until you reach that point, if you ever do, it's okay to focus on your safety and peace of mind, even if that requires letting her say and believe things you know to be false without bothering to fight her on them.\n\n> I cant tell if im the reason we argue so much?\n\nShe's rewriting history mid-fight.
