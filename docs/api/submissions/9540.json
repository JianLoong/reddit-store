We argue constantly and never seem to go more than a week without having a fight. Its gotten worse now that im\nabout to move away for college. Mainly the arguments are about how she treated me while i was growing up and how what she did hurt me. It goes back and forth for hours and she doubles down on how im overreacting and how she tried her best to be the best mom she could be. Sometimes though she will say something that hurts really bad, and any time i try bringing it up she denies that it ever happened. Ive tried to let it go but it recently got to the point where i couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. It became harder and harder to just sit and have her talk to me like i was going insane. She kept telling me i was making these \u201cfabrications\u201d and how i always try to make her the bad guy. Last time we argued i recorded it despite knowing my mom has trauma around being recorded. During that argument i remember clear as day that i told her trauma wasnt a contest and she responded by telling me that it was. I ended up walking away. Today we got into another argument about the same\nthing and i explained to her how her treating my trauma like it was nothing just because she had it worse as a kid hurt me. She told me shes never done that. I quoted the last argument we had saying her i remember her telling me that trauma was a contest. She again denied it. I played her the video and she got quiet. She started pacing and acting really weird? Then she just snapped and started yelling at me saying that i treated our issues like a game. That i kept the recording so i could \u201cwin\u201d and how i was awful for doing that. She told me i took what she said out of context and recorded me knowing she couldnt stand the idea of being recorded. I feel awful. She said that i kept it only so i could throw it back in her face. I didnt think she would react that badly to the recording. I only wanted to prove to her that she DID say that. I knew she wouldnt LIKE being recorded but i didnt realise she would be that upset. I dont know if i overstepped, i love my mom i didnt want to hurt her. I cant tell if im the reason we argue so much?

Parental gaslighting of this nature is so hard to deal with. However, recording your mom is unlikely to achieve your goals. Sounds like your mom has some issues that require professional help. She has to want to work on them. If you can, when you can, find yourself a therapist to help you work through this stuff on your end. This kind of behavior in a parent is so damaging.", "Dear your mother is a narcissist. She is going to mistreat you, and lie about it. If you call her out, she will blame you. If you prove she's a liar, she will blame you. But this isn't your fault - it's because your mother is a bad person. You didn't do anything wrong here standing up for yourself.   \n\n\nI recommend putting distance between you.\n\nNTA.", "Google DARVO, it will help you understand why your mom did what she did.

Deny that you said it?  Hear your own words!\n\nThe way she snapped after you doesn't surprise me, you absolutely exposed her lies with undeniable proof and left her no room for escape.  A good person would have accepted responsibility for what they did. Your mom isn't a good person and will not accept responsibility for her abuse and manipulations.  Since you removed her option to Deny, she went on the Attack and tried to play the victim card to Reverse the Victim and Offender.\n\nNTA", "Nta she needs therapy, not an emotional support human.", "NTA - she is abusive, traumatizing and gaslighting you. She had a chance for introspection ... and failed to take it.", "NTA - She needs therapy", "She is the problem. Keep to yourself and move out.", "NTA & I'm glad you are headed away for college. Time away will help. You'll probably have access to therapy thru your college/university,  too. It's helpful after dealing with this kind of relationship with your mom.", "NTA\n\nYour mom can't stand the idea of being wrong, she really does need therapy. Trauma can block memories so that's understandable, sometimes anyways, but it's weird that when she's given evidence, she freaks out... \n\nI hope your mom seeks therapy for her trauma, and whatever the reason is to why she feels like she needs to win arguments and belittle your trauma.", "NTA. \n\nGently, consider avoiding these type of conversations with her moving forward. She\u2019s absolutely in the wrong for treating you like this, however, you are unlikely to get the apology you\u2019re looking for. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re going to college soon - that will likely give you the time and space you need to start to heal.  \n\nBut yeah your mother has clearly shown you that she\u2019s not an emotionally safe person to be vulnerable with, so take that advice to heart, and protect yourself accordingly.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA.\n\nYou were being gaslighted every time you had an argument, and she was upset with you because you had literal proof that she was gaslighting you. \n\nYou did what you had to do to prove your point. Your mom sounds horrible.\n\nI'm so sorry you deal with this manipulation and toxicity from your own mother.", "I think the reason she doesn't like being recorded is because she's a narcissist and that ruins the gaslighting she does. \n\nYou are not crazy. You know what she does. You know what she says. Until she can get help, she'll always be in denial. My parent was a classic narcissist. Until I finally set boundaries, it never improved. \n\nI don't think you're an AH for recording the conversation because I know you just needed to show her that this isn't all in your head. However she'll never get help unless she wants to. I hope getting away for college can help but you can't keep enabling her with these conversations. She'll never see what she did was \"that bad\" as long as she sees \"she's right\".  \n\nI'd also suggest you get into therapy. It honestly was a huge help in figuring out how to, well, figure things out. Maybe you can't get her to understand how her actions made you feel but maybe you can work on it so that it doesn't define who you are.  I wish you the best of luck", "\"I feel awful. \"\n\nShe has an amazing amount of control over you.\n\n\" I cant tell if im the reason we argue so much?\"\n\nWhy do you talk and argue for hours on end?

She has narcissistic tendencies at the very least. She can not and will not take accountability for her behavior. You are not her emotional support person and should not be. She can\u2019t stand the idea that she is wrong, hurtful, or traumatizing you. All she sees it her own trauma that she clearly never properly treated or managed. I would suggest not arguing with her any longer, period! When an argument starts, walk away or hang up the phone! Establish a boundary with her and hold her account when she steamrolls over it. I\u2019d go minimum contact with her once you\u2019re at school so that you can focus on your and your studies. Not saying to cut her off completely, but a bit. It not worth the arguing and fighting with her when she refuses to take accountability for her part in anything.", "Of course she hates being recorded, it makes it way harder to lie about stuff later.", "NTA. I mean the fuck did she expect? It's like playing tag with someone and everytime you catch them, they deny you ever caught them. Then when you have proof of catching them, they make a fuss and say \"you recorded it just to prove me wrong\", isn't that the point??", "ESH. I think both of you want to be right and nothing you posted is good for either of you. You taped her, knowing it would upset her because you need to be right. Someone needs to step up and be the adult here, stop rehashing the same argument and refuse to engage about it. It's not getting you anywhere.", "ESH - Not sure WHY you both keep getting into these arguments, but it takes TWO.  That's why I chose ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She doesn't want to be recorded because then she can't keep changing things around to suit whatever she wants to argue about.

NTA. NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA. I am so sorry you are going through this. You absolutely do not deserve it.\n\nGo away to college, go NC (or at very least, low low contact), and get into therapy.

I don\u2019t speak to her much after moving out.", "NTA, but the hard truth is that you're never going to get what you want from these arguments. You're never going to change her. She's not going to listen to your argument and suddenly realize that she's wrong. You're beating your head against a wall. \n\nKeep your head down and minimize contact until you can leave. Once you leave, go as low-contact as you can and get therapy so that you can heal and move forward on your own terms and live your life the way you want to live.", "Your mom sounds like she suffers from mental illness, OP.\n\nSome people are claiming narcissism. I get vibes more like schizo-affective.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your mom seems to be deeply traumatized, and absolutely not remembering stuff can be part of that. But... She is traumatizing you. This is partly how more generational trauma works. She reacts unreflecting on her own trauma, you react on her trauma reaction, and when no one breaks the circle your kid will be the next in line. She is not behaving like a mother, it seems she wants you to validate her trauma... that's not your job. You are the kid and you \"job\" is to grow and become a confident, content person, to persue your goals, to be a good person, to maybe find a partner and found a family if that's what you want to... Parenting your mom isn't. At the same time, while parenting you is her job, sadly she doesn't seem to be fully able to do so. So for your own peace of mind, give the both of you a break when it is possible, and concentrate on healing for yourself.", "NTA. She was pacing quietly because she was trying to figure out a way to turn it back on you.

That\u2019s why you felt the need to record. It\u2019s common in situations like this. This is very unhealthy but you don\u2019t have any authority over her so I don\u2019t see it getting better. I\u2019m sorry, just remember you are not crazy! Trust your mind and know you are right. Always! Even if you have to say what she wants to hear to keep the peace. Don\u2019t doubt yourself!!", "i had to deal with a similar situation. i always recorded what was said between us out of fear something would happen and then maybe my side would be seen. i ended up leaving and never returning, it was one of the hardest but best decisions of my life.", "NTA. You were trying to hold her accountable and she responded by denying what she did and attacking you. You recorded her for justifiable reasons. The problem is that your mother is not a good person who wants a healthy, respectful, two way relationship with you. She has an image of herself as a good mother and it's your job to agree. Your feelings don't matter.  That isn't right and it isn't fair. Your experience is real and legitimate. \n\nShe may never understand or apologize. She may be emotionally immature, or insecure, or just a bully. She may never be the mother you want or deserve. Your best bet here I think is to interact less and focus on your future. With more independence you will be able to decide how often you are in contact with her.", "NTA. Everything your mom is accusing you of actually applies to her. You can use that like a rule of thumb. She accuses you of something? It almost certainly applies to her. She was trying to \u201cwin\u201d trauma and got upset because you \u201coutplayed\u201d her and all of this is shit. I\u2019m sorry. Get some distance from her as soon as you can.", "My mom was exactly like this. We never resolved anything.  She would break down into tears at any attempt to unpack my childhood traumas caused mostly by her. After she told me I'd be alone forever I went no contact until my father's funeral.  She died a few years later and apparently told my sisters some stories about me and now they don't talk to me. It's a no win situation. I'm sorry. Big hugs.", "One of the most satisfying days of my life was when I finally told my mom that I wasn't her emotional support animal. She hung up on me and didn't talk to me for a week, but at least she quit screaming at me after that. (And yes, she also refused therapy. She was definitely a narcissist.)", "NTA - I'm sorry, it must be tough to hear. Narcissists don't learn that way. They need professional help and they need to want to change. I spent years doing these types of things with my spouse (I didn't know he was a narcissist), and never made an inch of progress. We even did couples counseling and he's been seeing his own for a few years now. Zero change, because no matter what, he only views himself as right and everyone else is always wrong.\n\nWhat helped me a lot was learning more about narcissism (there are different kinds, I was unaware!), how to spot it, and best ways to protect myself from people like that. Fortify yourself to mitigate the damage best you can."]}
