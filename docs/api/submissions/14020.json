My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and there hasn\u2019t been a hitch so far. The only problem is his sister\u2019s jealousy. To be completely honest, I have tried my absolute best to be nice to her and accept their \u2018twin bond\u2019. I understand this is something I will never fully comprehend. However, she has just been awful.\n\nWhile there has been a history of these events, the inciting incident for the argument happened last weekend. The three of us went to a concert. He and his sister are really big fans of the band, but I was mostly going to appease my boyfriend. Tickets were pretty expensive and he bought mine. However (and I think my boyfriend is at fault for this one), my boyfriend and his sister\u2019s tickets were for the pit. I was stuck, alone in the stands. I didn\u2019t realise that we\u2019d be in different spots until we arrived at the concert.\n\nWhen we arrived, my boyfriend was apologetic. He tried to spend as much time with me as possible in the stands, but his sister wouldn\u2019t stop calling him. She was begging him to go back down to the pit so they could secure good spots before the band came out - an HOUR before the opening band even started. He promised me he\u2019d come back up to see me during the show, after they\u2019d played his favourite songs.\n\nIn essence, he never came back. It had been about an hour and a half and I looked down at the pit to see his sister with her arms wrapped around his neck. This was the final straw, I stormed out before the concert ended. I texted my boyfriend, telling him to come to my house after the concert was over. He never showed up. I came to find out the next morning that this was because his sister wouldn\u2019t let him. She stole his phone and insisted they had to spend the night together as this was their \u201cspecial night\u201d.\n\nI had a huge fight with him over this last night, telling my boyfriend that his sister was possessive and overly obsessed with him. In a moment of blind rage, I told him that their relationship was weirdly romantic, almost incestous. My boyfriend was furious and explained it was disgusting for me to suggest such a thing. He stormed out of my house and I haven\u2019t spoken to him since.\n\nAgain, there have been several other incidents. Last year, my boyfriend bought me a beautiful necklace for my birthday and his sister insisted that I was a \u201cgolddigger\u201d. She commented on the fact that he hadn\u2019t bought her an expensive gift for their birthday that year. This deeply upset me and made me feel as though I was undeserving of my boyfriend\u2019s generosity.\n\nThe sister and I also work at the same place. My boyfriend\u2019s sister consistently makes me cover for her shifts, so that she can hang out with him.\n\nAITA?\n\n(edit) More of the sister\u2019s sins:\n\n* She has to approve of his friends\n* She can\u2019t walk home from work alone without him\n* She won\u2019t let him move in with me (he \u201cneeds her\u201d)\n* Every time we\u2019re out together as a three, people assume they are the couple \n* She said my breasts were not big enough for him and that a bosom like hers would \u201cplease him more\u201d\n* She often steals his phone to read through our texts and has made comments on my nudes\n* She insists we can\u2019t be alone together in their house", "created_utc": 1680660792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c51dt/aita_for_getting_into_a_fight_with_my_boyfriend/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sick. First chance you get, delete those pictures from his phone and don't send any more. Nta", "NTA.  Sounds like you may be right, or at least his sister might be in love with him.  Either way, you should consider if you really want to put up with this for the rest of your life.", "NTA dump him that\u2019s just toxic and you don\u2019t need that in your life. His sister is sick and until he realizes it it won\u2019t matter what you or anyone else says.", "NTA - I've known plenty of twins, they don't act like that.  Even identical twins don't act like that.  She's using \"twin bond\" as an excuse for some extremely sketchy behavior.  This isn't a relationship that you're going to win, and I think you already know it.  She's your boyfriend's primary relationship and you are, at best, the mistress.\n\nCut your losses and get yourself a man that isn't controlled by his obsessed sibling.", "NTA! I\u2019m an identical twin and am very close to my twin sister. Their behavior is mind boggling! They excluded you from sitting next to them at a concert. Your boyfriend made the mistake of going with her instead. He should\u2019ve stayed with you. Her putting her arms around him?! No way in hell!! Then he did that at the concert and went to stay the night with her?!! You should never date this guy again. You deserve so much more.", "Nta, i cant get over the boob comment and nudes. Like how does your bf think this appropriate?", "I'm sorry but are you dating Jaime Lannister?!?! This is unhinged AF. Like this is not red flags, is a giant f\\*cking red building! Dump him and run.", "Ah! Ah! NTA! Gross, weird, disgusting, she\u2019s controlling and totally bonkers. Also the comment on her boob size would please him more than yours is just wayyy out of line. NTA, that\u2019s just so weird!", "WTF!!! Sister\u2019s a full on freak. You do not need that in your life. Tell him it\u2019s either her or you.", "NTA. At best, the twins have a codependent relationship that\u2019s only going to get worse. If you ever decide to marry this man it\u2019s going to be a lifetime of him taking his sisters side and them gas lighting you making you the problem", "NTA - if he reaches out put your foot down. He needs to move out and stop acting like conjoined twins. \nHis sister will never meet anyone if he's always around too..guys aren't gonna want him around all the time as a 3rd wheel either. \nIf he reads all your text on his phone it might be worth sending a few home truths for her to read....like you think she has the hots for him and list those weird things she's said before I.e. breast comment. So weird. \nMe personally I'd run!", "Nta\nIma need an update on how it goes when you break up with him or make him realize she's weird.", "NTA....this REEKS of a some kind of incestuous relationship. 21yrs old is no excuse talking about a \"sibling\" bond. They have had the first years of their life to develop said bond and by now should be able to move about without worrying about the other. Sounds like she's never had a boyfriend and doesn't seem to keen on getting her own anytime soon.  The fact she goes through his phone, let alone takes it and hides it from him is beyond ridiculous. She made sure he wouldn't be able to get with you later and had him all to herself. I'd bet she seduced him when they were younger and now he can't get out from under her, hence the controlling behavior of the sister. And his reluctance to stand up to her. Get out while you can and find someone who has a backbone.", "NTA-I\u2019m very close to my twin and our brother, the triplet bond in our case is real but your boyfriend\u2019s twin is going too far and he\u2019s enabling it.", "NTA. But your feelings should be directed towards *both* of them. Think about this. \n\n-Why does he ignore you for the entirety of the concert, THEN not even contact you for the rest of the night? He\u2019s a grown man? He\u2019s not \u201callowed\u201d his phone?\n-Why does he \u201callow\u201d her to call you a gold digger, and body shame you?\n-Why does he let her see your noods in the first place? \n\nNeither respects your boundaries, or considers your feelings. I hope you have more healthy relationships available to you in your life. You should never feel so trapped, or unheard in any relationship.", "Oh boy. NTA. I say that as a twin sister of a guy who has also frequently been mistaken for my partner, lol. We shared a room until I left town for college, so we are also super close to the extent that it makes people feel weird about us even though nothing gross is going on. (I guess \"Game of Thrones\" made them think it? Lol.) In fact, his type is the absolute opposite of me (ditto) and he once dumped a girl because someone pointed out she vaguely resembled me. So yeah, being close to a twin of the opposite sex can be delicate, and it is frustrating to constantly have to tell people that you aren't together romantically, but if you're actively enforcing and respecting boundaries it'll be okay. \n\nMy worry is that it feels like Cersei (lol, I dunno what else to call her) doesn't want boundaries and your boyfriend seems content to let that be the case because in some way she is the more important woman in his life, even if it isn't romantic. Like if she were an overly possessive mother, it would be the same problem unless your boyfriend stood up to her and told her to give him space. It's a tough spot to be in and you'd honestly be better off getting out than slogging through. \n\nI hope things work out best for you.", "NTA. \u201cbosoms like hers\u201d??????

You are definitely the third wheel in this relationship.

If you\u2019re okay with it, I\u2019d show him this thread. Let him see that he is the ONLY one that thinks this is okay and everyone else can see it for what it is.

I can understand mentioning your feelings on specific things his sister has done directly to you. The sister knows she has a place to do these things, because he\u2019s allowed it. What makes YTA in my book is fighting with him over his relationship with his sister. Sadly, either get out or deal. Personally, I\u2019d break it off with him. \n\nIt\u2019s not all the sister\u2019s fault, he\u2019s equally complicit. Clearly he sees no issues with his relationship with his sister. Otherwise he\u2019d make the changes himself on his own, without your thoughts or insistence. \n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to fully except the odd relationship they have together\u2026.get out of the relationship with your bf. Go get the kind of relationship you want to have. You should not get involved in his sibling bond. You\u2019re just going to create a wedge between you and your bf.

I say you are NTA. Having read what you wrote twice, I believe your bf's sister is having so many issues that makes her clingy and controlling that she truly needs help. I am sure you are not the first person she may have been mean and possessive over her brother\n\nSorry but not sorry to tell you this but unfortunately I don't believe your relationship with him is worth salvaging and secondly, you deserve better. Ask yourself this: are you sure you are willing to put this up further when she is in the way at the expense of your happiness and your mental health? \n\nTime for you to call it quits on the relationship and move on.

She is definitely NTA. She\u2019s the victim in this situation.", "I think the point was that she is projecting all guilt onto the sister while her boyfriend is absolutely complicit in this kind of behaviour, and that that is unfair to the sister, the boyfriend, and herself.", "I was thinking this, too. I still think the extreme circumstances make her NTA, but her problem is the boyfriend, not really the sister.
