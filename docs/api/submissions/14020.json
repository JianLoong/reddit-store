Even identical twins don't act like that.  She's using \"twin bond\" as an excuse for some extremely sketchy behavior.  This isn't a relationship that you're going to win, and I think you already know it.

I\u2019m an identical twin and am very close to my twin sister. Their behavior is mind boggling! They excluded you from sitting next to them at a concert.

Then he did that at the concert and went to stay the night with her?!! You should never date this guy again. You deserve so much more.", "Nta, i cant get over the boob comment and nudes.

Dump him and run.", "Ah! Ah! NTA! Gross, weird, disgusting, she\u2019s controlling and totally bonkers. Also the comment on her boob size would please him more than yours is just wayyy out of line. NTA, that\u2019s just so weird!", "WTF!!! Sister\u2019s a full on freak. You do not need that in your life. Tell him it\u2019s either her or you.", "NTA.

So weird. \nMe personally I'd run!", "Nta\nIma need an update on how it goes when you break up with him or make him realize she's weird.", "NTA....this REEKS of a some kind of incestuous relationship. 21yrs old is no excuse talking about a \"sibling\" bond. They have had the first years of their life to develop said bond and by now should be able to move about without worrying about the other. Sounds like she's never had a boyfriend and doesn't seem to keen on getting her own anytime soon.  The fact she goes through his phone, let alone takes it and hides it from him is beyond ridiculous. She made sure he wouldn't be able to get with you later and had him all to herself. I'd bet she seduced him when they were younger and now he can't get out from under her, hence the controlling behavior of the sister. And his reluctance to stand up to her. Get out while you can and find someone who has a backbone.", "NTA-I\u2019m very close to my twin and our brother, the triplet bond in our case is real but your boyfriend\u2019s twin is going too far and he\u2019s enabling it.", "NTA. But your feelings should be directed towards *both* of them. Think about this. \n\n-Why does he ignore you for the entirety of the concert, THEN not even contact you for the rest of the night? He\u2019s a grown man? He\u2019s not \u201callowed\u201d his phone?\n-Why does he \u201callow\u201d her to call you a gold digger, and body shame you?\n-Why does he let her see your noods in the first place? \n\nNeither respects your boundaries, or considers your feelings. I hope you have more healthy relationships available to you in your life. You should never feel so trapped, or unheard in any relationship.", "Oh boy. NTA. I say that as a twin sister of a guy who has also frequently been mistaken for my partner, lol. We shared a room until I left town for college, so we are also super close to the extent that it makes people feel weird about us even though nothing gross is going on. (I guess \"Game of Thrones\" made them think it? Lol.) In fact, his type is the absolute opposite of me (ditto) and he once dumped a girl because someone pointed out she vaguely resembled me. So yeah, being close to a twin of the opposite sex can be delicate, and it is frustrating to constantly have to tell people that you aren't together romantically, but if you're actively enforcing and respecting boundaries it'll be okay. \n\nMy worry is that it feels like Cersei (lol, I dunno what else to call her) doesn't want boundaries and your boyfriend seems content to let that be the case because in some way she is the more important woman in his life, even if it isn't romantic. Like if she were an overly possessive mother, it would be the same problem unless your boyfriend stood up to her and told her to give him space. It's a tough spot to be in and you'd honestly be better off getting out than slogging through. \n\nI hope things work out best for you.", "NTA. \u201cbosoms like hers\u201d??????

I can understand mentioning your feelings on specific things his sister has done directly to you. The sister knows she has a place to do these things, because he\u2019s allowed it.

Personally, I\u2019d break it off with him. \n\nIt\u2019s not all the sister\u2019s fault, he\u2019s equally complicit. Clearly he sees no issues with his relationship with his sister.

I still think the extreme circumstances make her NTA, but her problem is the boyfriend, not really the sister. I feel like even if the sister weren't insane and obsessive, the bigger problem is that OP feels like second place in his affections in general, which does suck.", "NTA\n\nI'm going to give your bf the benefit of the doubt for a moment since your post is about the sister's actions, not really your bf. He isn't putting up appropriate boundaries, but that's not the same as being actively incestuous, and can be a sign of victimhood. \n\nThe sister is emotionally abusive. If her relationship with your bf *were* romantic, she would be displaying classic red flags of an abusive partner: isolating him from others, dictating who he spends his time with, insisting he \"needs her,\" going through his phone, etc. Everyone on Reddit would be yelling at your bf to run away from her as fast as possible. \n\nYour bf is being abused. And abused people often cannot recognize just how wrong their position is. Incest is also used as a tool of control and abuse in family dynamics. I think the fact that the sister's abuse is also emotionally incestuous is also part of why your bf may struggle to see it. No one wants to admit their sister is abusive--but even more than that *no one wants to admit their sister is incestuous!* Incest isn't just bad, it's *taboo*. When faced with the possibility of this realization--and how he might have enabled or be implicated in this taboo as well--I can understand why your bf would slam his blinders on. When things are too horrible to process, many people simply won't process them. Especially when there's no telling how far back this goes. When did his sister start behaving this way? How many cherished memories will be tainted by this realization? How many boundaries did she cross--and at what age-that he has played off as normal so he won't have to acknowledge he has been harmed and potentially sexually harassed by his sister? \n\nIf I were you, I'd back away from the incest conversation for now. It's such a big taboo that it's likely you won't make progress. Instead, focus on the emotional abuse and the need for boundary setting. Processing the emotional incest will likely only happen if he first acknowledges the abuse and control issues. I'd highly suggest he get a therapist. \n\nI do want to clarify: this is not your responsibility. You cannot \"fix\" someone or save them from an abusive situation. They have to do that work themselves. But if you do want to stay with your bf, you cannot do so when he is also in this situation.", "NTA. Especially after reading the edit.\n\nYour BF should not be sharing your nudes with *anyone*. If you want someone else to see them, you will share them directly. I don't care if it's just from someone picking up his phone and not sending them via messages. This alone is a giant red flag.\n\nHer having to approve his friends? Her deciding if he moves in with someone? That's highly controlling and toxic at minimum, abusive if left unchecked.\n\nAnd she insults your body? Calls you a golddigger? And he still puts her first?\n\nOP, dump this guy. He's too enmeshed in a very toxic relationship. If you do stay together, insist on couples therapy where you can begin to get through to him that his current status quo is not healthy and never will be.

I was honestly relieved because they gross me tf out. Im not the only one with this complaint. My younger brother says the same thing. The only way I know they aren\u2019t doing anything is my brother is gay. They are just weirdly obsessed with each other. You know that TLC show where they exploit emotional incest mom is super close to their child making dating god awful and awkward. If there was a sibling version of that show my siblings would be on season 1, not even joking. They both audition for reality TV crap all the time. I\u2019m adopted and I was allowed 0 alone time with my brother when we met because my sister had to be there. I\u2019ve since cut them off for other reasons but I can\u2019t lie this partly made my decision. I suggest you do the same if he is refusing to change. It\u2019s only gonna get weirder, more competitive, miserable until the inevitable happens and she forces him to choose, he will choose her 100% of the time because despite being bro and sister that\u2019s his woman. You\u2019re 2nd. It\u2019s not a twin thing, it\u2019s a weird co-dependent thing. It\u2019s an uncomfortable thing to be around and I honestly wouldn\u2019t put up with it.", "NTA but run for the hills.    \n\n\nHis sister is crossing the lines of a sibling relationship into romantic/sexual.

You however are enabling it (in a soft way) by covering her shifts.  No is a word in the English language and doesn't need to be explained further than 'no'.

There's no way that your relationship is going to recover from that in a healthy way. How could he possibly stay with somebody who has openly said they think he's capable commiting the act of incest. He could cut contact with his sister? But then he's cutting out family for you, not healthy. Or the pair of you will split up and he'll lean into that twin bond.

Peoples assumptions aren't purely based on the interactions of individuals in a group, but on perceived misconceptions. Since ops bf and his sister look alike, that might play a part. Remember there was that weird thing the past around that said you're more likely to date someone who looks similar to you?\n\nLike i said, the whole thing is weird though and the fact that op has called him out on this would hopefully get him to open his eyes that his sister is weird as hell."]}
