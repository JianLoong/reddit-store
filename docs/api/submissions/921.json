Should\u2019ve declined the speech and worked your issues out in therapy.  YTA.", "Bro, \"My brother's a sexual predator\" isn't \"gentle ribbing\".  Holy shit.", "\u201cGentle ribbing\u201d doesn\u2019t usually include razzing your pervert brother for his history of harassing women in the context of your parents anniversary. You\u2019re just a weirdo dude. and YTA", "It's even law in Canada that an apology is not legally an admission of guilt; since we apologize for everything lol", "A time that the OP was ignorant of. I never equated to such I noted it more as ignorance of the history there and by that innocence by not being involved in the matter until this event happened with the joke.  It's not even a joke in poor taste when removed from the context others have put onto it because of the past event OP was not knowing of, but then taste is opinion. \n\nTelling a joke in bad taste is something you do apologize for because you're not ignorant of the context you're just not reading the room.  No malicious intent there but not ignorant of context that others would have for it.\n\nIn this case the context of the teller differs from the listener because of information the listener had but the teller did not, and over an incident the teller did not participate in.\n\nThis is a guilt by association issue, and not the problem of the op the others involved need to deal with it because they didn't handle it appropriately and people in the family were left in the dark about the issue.", "The thing if it is there is a difference between hurting someone and someone taking offense. This is taking offense, there was literally no intent to harm, no malice, no knowledge of the previous issues it's a moment to educate and help and used to point a finger and vent on the actions and misdeeds of someone else.\n\nIt may be seen as an odd hill to die on but it's on the act of the op a purely social act of trying to form a communal comedic moment and someone else comes in and says \"well actually that's insulting to me because of this\", and that's what these situations are a socially acceptable well actually moment. Some are very well founded but some aren't.  I find this one to not be founded because of the OP not knowing the past history, and honestly OP wasn't a part of it the other parts of her family didn't deal with the situation well.", "Cool! \n\nThanks for that completely irrelevant piece of information, like it somehow changes things.", "Right, and you think this is FUNNY??? That he made girls uncomfortable? That they felt unsafe around him and likely very scared? You think that's an APPROPRIATE joke for a 40th wedding anniversary? You think sexual harassment is funny? YTA", "Well, the joke you told had the punchline that it's funny your brother has a history of harassing and possibly assaulting women, depending on what you mean by \"handsy\"", "Oy. Your brother might be \"handsy\" (aka a sexual harasser/groper/assaulter) but you're either blind or wildly obtuse.", "Not at your parents 40th wedding anniversary its not. Read the room. Joking about sexual harassment was clearly not a good idea.", "No. What you can do is stop making jokes about creepers. It's not funny. Grow up.", "I mean maybe for your family\u2026mine, while far from perfect, is a little bit more ribald", "Thing is, OP admits in the comments that their brother is a known perv. So whether or not they knew about that one incident, it was still an inappropriate joke to make.\n\nThere's also a difference between apologizing to admit fault and apologizing because you said or did something out of ignorance. In this case, OP had enough context to know not to make the joke regardless of knowledge of the event in question and did it anyway.", ">The thing if it is there is a difference between hurting someone and someone taking offense. \n\nSure, but OP DID hurt them. He didn't mean to, but what he said was hurtful and upsetting. It's not just them taking offence to something completely arbitrary. \n\nBut also, why is it such a terrible thing to say \"I'm so sorry I upset you, it wasn't my intention\"? Even if it was an accident, is OP not sorry that he upset them?", "You seem like you've been instilled with a lot of love and kindness from friends and family.
