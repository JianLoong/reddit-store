However, I was adopted & she's always maintained a certain distance towards me. She has not ill-treated me, but she doesn't consider me family. She had not wanted me to attend the wedding & made that clear. It was a rather grand affair, but only those who were close to her had attended. She said that as I am \"not related to her\", I should not attend.\n\nMy parents asked me to understand by saying that it's her wedding, etc. I did not protest & did not attend. However, I also have not properly talked to her for a year now. She sent me her wedding photos, but I did not respond to her.\n\nShe also informed that she's pregnant, and I just said congratulations & ended the call. Now, I did not hear back from her again until she gave birth  to her daughter, who is my niece. They called me to inform, and I just said congrats.\n\nThey asked me whether I am not going to attend & buy my niece expensive gifts, and I said \"You did not want me at your wedding. I don't want to anything to do with your marriage and whatever results out of it.\" They did not take that well and began to yell at me, accusing me of being a terrible uncle and all that, for not even seeing her.\n\nBut I just asked them to fuck off & have not seen my niece. My parents and friends are saying that I did the wrong thing and that I should go see them, etc.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701789908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18beb11/aita_for_being_a_terrible_uncle_by_not_seeing_my/", "score": 228, "replies": ["NTA.

Do they know shes stated she does not feel related to you??", "NTA. Sorry your family treats you poorly.", "Very obvious NTA.", "NTA - your sister is awful!", "NTA - this says it all\n\n*They asked me whether I am not going to attend & buy my niece expensive gifts,*\n\nShe doesn't want a relationship with you. She wants you to buy her child expensive gifts.", "Absolutely NTA, they didn't want you at their wedding.   They only want you involved when they want something 'expensive' from you.  To say you were a terrible uncle when she said you weren't related is kind of hypocritical.  That's not family--that's a leech.   Make your own family and celebrate them.", "NTA but why was this posted twice?", "Fuck them and feed them fishheads", "NTA Buy her expensive gifts? She couldn't even tolerate you at her wedding but expects expensive gifts. I would be telling her to GTFO.", "NTA, but moving forward it may help to think of your niece as her own person, without the baggage of your sister from adoption. Nothing would piss her off more than you being the favorite adult. It is a lot easier since you aren't the disciplinary figure.", "\u201cExpensive\u201d gifts at that. That stood out in the post, for me. NTA OP.", "Theyre not related apparently but all of a sudden he\u2019s a shit uncle for not getting expensive gifts \ud83d\ude44.", "Yep! They just want expensive gifts for their daughter. I thought you werent related enough to be invited to her wedding, but you\u2019re related enough to be an uncle & expect expensive gifts for their child?! Fuck them! NTA. Bow can someone be this shameless?!", "NTA.\n\nShe literally told you that you weren't invited to her wedding because the two of you weren't related to each other (nevermind the fact that you're her adoptive brother), but when she has a baby, you're suddenly her baby's uncle?\n\nThe first thing she does after telling you her child is born is to ask you when you'll give her \"expensive\" gifts?\n\nYour adoptive sister is a self-entitled and greedy woman, but I also think that you're parents are AH's as well. Your adoptive sister, parents and idiot friends who claim you were wrong in this situation should screw themselves.", "*<She said that as I am \"not related to her\", I should not attend.>*\n\n*<They asked me whether I am not going to attend &* ***buy my niece expensive gifts****,>*\n\nHow can this child be your niece if, according to the mother, you are not related?\n\nNTA", "NTA. If you\u2019re not part of the family you have no reason to see niece or buy things for her. However it is possible that sister had a change of heart after giving birth. Some people do change their opinions about things after having children.", "NTA\n\nIf she's \"not related to you\" then that baby is not your niece.", "Nta they just want your money therefore you owe her nothing", "NTA\n\nSo you're not family enough to be invited to a wedding but you are family enough to buy gifts for a baby. They can't have it both ways.\n\nI think your sister is a total snake but it seems she was allowed to be and catered to by your parents her whole life. I feel this whole thing is incredibly hurtful to you OP and I am really sorry for that.", "NTA", "She just wants stuff.  You are missing nothing.  NTA.", "> why would you be important enough to be included in their babies lives?\n\nApparently OP's adopted but OP's money is family!", "Yep just like that they are a loving family.", "NTA. Chaia has made it clear you are not related to her. Which means you are also not related to any children she may have.   \nWhy would you go visit and dote on and buy expensive gifts for a baby you aren't related to?", "NTA; it\u2019s pretty obvious they just want money and gifts from you. She doesn\u2019t get to disavow you as family, then expect the benefits of being family anyway. And PS, your \u2018parents\u2019 suck for defending her.", "Ah, I see the problem. They want expensive gifts from you for your niece and you haven't offered anything yet. Smh... she made it clear she doesn't see you as family, your parents told you to understand that it's her wedding and you accepted that fact. Now she wants you to give them expensive gifts like nothing happened and you always were family. Such entitlement from all of them. NTA", "You can\u2019t be her uncle if you\u2019re not her brother. If she won\u2019t acknowledge and accept you as a sibling then you have no niece. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI'm confused here. She  has repeatedly said she doesn't consider you family, and that y'all aren't related. But now all of a sudden she wants you to act like a uncle, when she has never considered you her brother? She needs to make up her mind.\n\nIf she is perhaps having a change of heart, and wants you to be family now. She needs to make that known, and apologize for how she's treated you in the past.", "NTA.  She made her opinion quite clear with the wedding.  She doesn\u2019t consider you family.  Now that she has a child, it suddenly occurs to her that she might have cut off her nose?  She set the terms herself\u2026you\u2019re not related to her, in her eyes.  Therefore, you\u2019re not related to her children.  \n\nBTW, sorry to say it, but your parents suck.  It\u2019s quite clear who their golden child is.", "And what\u2019s wrong with OPs parents for allowing her to do all of this?  NTA", "That is still using the child to get back at the mother tho.\n\nBetter to just cut contact and any relation. Not his sister and not his niece. Not his family.", "It is pretty clear why.\n\n\"expensive gifts\""]}
