She\u2019s one of my closest friends but she has had some bad takes on race-related topics on the rare ocassion it comes up in conversation.\n\nAnyway, I was telling her about the time a kid in middle school mocked East Asians by pulling his eyes back and I\u2019d said \u201cYou know I\u2019m Asian right?\u201d and stopped talking to him. Even though he wasn\u2019t mocking me ig I was trying to tell him \u201cI\u2019m not cool with that, wtf\u201d in the best way a middle schooler can.\n\nWell Lucy responded to my story with \u201cWell\u2026you\u2019re not really Asian\u201d.

One of our other friends mentioned that she\u2019s mad at me for gossiping about her and sharing a private convo.

Ever lived there?\n\nNow, I don't know all the context, but from this post it seems sorta like she's like one of those Americans who have only lived in the US and are claiming to be Irish, Italian, Dutch, Swedish or whatever, but don't know the language, the culture, the place, so it's actually only their ancestors who is Irish, Italian, Dutch, Swedish or whatever.", "How is you, who are half Chinese, being taunted by a gesture used to taunt Chinese people, a refutation of the statement that that gesture is used to taunt Chinese people?\n\nI'm so confused.", "Asian.", "East Asian.", "Yeah because *you are* Chinese. But if I didn't know you, I wouldn't assume you were Chinese because I know Kor ean, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Japanese etc.... people here too. \n\nI'm African, by birth & heritage I don't expect people to know which country I come from until I tell them.", "I get it but I\u2019m also in the same boat of Native American and white. Hopefully you won\u2019t run into the same dumbass who tried telling I wasn\u2019t half native only 1/4 cuz my blood can only come from my dad due to some old ass European law lol like gtfo.", "South American works fine.", "Russia is often considered a part of Europe because most Russian people live in the European part of Russia", "Um...no. British people don't call all East Asian people Chinese.", ">Your argument is that people are defined by geographic boundaries, as if the name of the continent defines them\n\nWell, no, it's not. It's that geographic terms define people based on geography. What did you think \"Asian\" or your preferred \"Not Asian\" refers to, if not the continent of Asia?\n\n>You're saying it makes sense to group together everybody on the continent of Asia just because that's how the tectonic plates are laid out, regardless of culture, language, history?\n\nNo, I'm saying that it makes more sense to group everyone on the continent of Asia than to group everyone outside of it. People on the same content tend to share history, religion, and, to some extent, culture. Do you honestly think an Idian has less in common with a Chinese than a Romanian has with a Ghanaian?\n\n>The first language is South American countries, for example, is Spanish\n\nAny guess as to why that is? Did it naturally occur as part of their linguistic development over millenia thus making it a strong cultural bond between the countries and people?\n\n>your argument is absurd.\n\nYes, your strawman is indeed ridiculous."]}
