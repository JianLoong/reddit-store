She\u2019s one of my closest friends but she has had some bad takes on race-related topics on the rare ocassion it comes up in conversation.\n\nAnyway, I was telling her about the time a kid in middle school mocked East Asians by pulling his eyes back and I\u2019d said \u201cYou know I\u2019m Asian right?\u201d and stopped talking to him. Even though he wasn\u2019t mocking me ig I was trying to tell him \u201cI\u2019m not cool with that, wtf\u201d in the best way a middle schooler can.\n\nWell Lucy responded to my story with \u201cWell\u2026you\u2019re not really Asian\u201d.

One of our other friends mentioned that she\u2019s mad at me for gossiping about her and sharing a private convo.

If you don\u2019t have those features, you don\u2019t really get it, and you never will because you don\u2019t share that feature with her and never will, and she cannot change it.. so acting like you\u2019re on the same page just kinda minimizes her experience.", "Sounds like Lucy might be worth losing as a friend.

I myself have been a victim of it, despite having an eyelid fold and being half-white. I also don\u2019t think you can only be offended by racism if you\u2019re the race being targeted. I\u2019m personally very offended by the n-word, for example, despite not being black. I\u2019m sure the eyelid gesture is painful for Lucy, but it\u2019s also something OP has experienced and it is likely hurtful to her as well. It shows a general lack of respect to all POCs, and as a middle schooler I think OP reacted appropriately. \n\nAs someone that has both been discriminated against for being Asian, but has also been told I\u2019m not Asian by other Asians, I sympathize with OP.

Most of the people I grew up with would think the same way.\n\n...and we'd be wrong. That's the difference. It's one thing to be ignorant and it's another to gatekeep on real asian-ness based on that ignorance.

She still tries to fight, so i threw my hands in the air and said nope your totally right they must be Australian, she finally sat and thought about it. Then she apologized and said she just only ever thinks of China, Japan, and Korea as Asian countries.
