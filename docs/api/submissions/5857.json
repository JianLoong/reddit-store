I am only asking her to pay 25% of the total bills and I will cover the remaining 75%. I reminded her that I also pay for all days out, takeaways etc. and never once ask for a penny from her.

You\u2019re getting taken advantage of.", "NTA, she's contributing a little over 1/6th of her income to your shared expenses and it sounds like you're contributing a lot more than that.  She's effectively living beyond her means and needs a reality check.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s make half as much as you.  If you contribute 75% and she contributes 25%, she\u2019s therefore contributing a third of what you are, and that\u2019s discounting the dates and everything else you pay for.  Why is she not able to contribute this much?", "NTA. You both should sit down and go through your monthly budget together. It's more than reasonable to expect her to contribute equitably based on her income.", "NTA. What I am hearing here is that she is not contributing enough in your eyes, and in hers since you earn enough you should just pay for it to ease her burden.\n\nThis does make her sound entitled. How you respond to this situation WILL set the standard for the relationship when it comes to money. If this matters to you, I wouldn't recommend being a doormat. Have a difficult discussion about your expectations, hold firm, and be realistic if you think you're incompatible. This is about how much YOU'RE comfortable spending in the relationship just as much as it is her.\n\nRemember that people who dislike any boundaries you put up usually benefit the most from your previous lack of them.", "NTA. The split of finances is something to be agreed upon. Your current agreement means you contribute more to your shared expenses because you make more money. It seems it's roughly something like a 75/25 split. If the expenses increase, it's only logical both your contributions should increase. \n\nIf even with 75% of her personal income at her disposal she still struggles to make ends meet, then she's living beyond her means. It's up to her to figure it out. Cutting down her personal spending seems like the most obvious and immediate solution. \n\nBut the way she's reacting and her solution of you simply covering more because you make more, is entitled. She's taking advantage of you and expecting you to bankroll her life. If you were ok with that, then that'd be it. But you're not. She can't and shouldn't even try to force you into supporting her financially.", "NTA sounds like she\u2019s taking advantage of you. \nShe\u2019s spending above her means.

Were you on an ARM?\n\nOtherwise, I think your request is perfectly reasonable. If she were living on her own, no way would she be paying as little as \u00a3450/month, even in the cheapest housing.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a firm believer that a couple should contribute the same portion of their take-home pay to the household bills.   So if she brings home \u00a31450 and you bring home \u00a32800, then she should pay 34% of the household bills.  That includes the mortgage, the utilities, and groceries at least.\n\nWhatever's left is the \"his\" and \"hers\" budgets, which would include the cars, phones, clothes, etc.  And then you can decide who's going to \"treat\" for takeaway, if you don't include that with the groceries.\n\nThis is a common model that works well for a lot of folks.", "NTA. Why does she think you should cover everything? I get that she earns less, but she doesn't pay for *anything* but part of the rent? That's nuts.", "NTA", "NTA. So if you earn about double her wage she earns about 1/3 of your combined income so is it not reasonable for her to contribute 1/3 of the costs? If you are asking her to cover 1/4 sounds like she has a good deal. If she paid \u00a3450 she would still have \u00a31000 of disposable income every month which is a lot if she\u2019s never paying for any of the things you do when you go out. \u00a3300 is a large monthly increase for your mortgage. It\u2019s not unreasonable at all for you to ask for money, we are all having to cut back and make sacrifices she is not exempt from that and needs a reality check.", "NTA,  when costs go up, they go up for everyone. By your figures,  she is not contributing a fair percentage.", "NTA -", "NTA. \n\nI would suggest you add up the cost of everything and show her, and then pay for household expenses and food proportionally to your incomes.", "NTA\n\nWhen my partner and I earned a decent amount of money, we\u2019d split the bills and housework equally. Different individual outgoings and salary\u2019s meant we each saved a different amount each year.\n\nWhen one of us went part time, we changed this based on the proportion of our salaries as it didn\u2019t seem fair that one of us could save and the other broke even each month. We\u2019re a team after all.\n\nThere are other considerations such as who takes on the mental load and housework. Also, are your takeaways, mortgage and outgoings etc higher because of your salary - as in, do you go to more expensive places because you (and only you) can afford it. If so, you should pay a larger share for these outgoings or cut back.\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve said though, it appears your partner is acting unreasonable and isn\u2019t even open to a financial discussion putting them very much in the wrong.", "NTA she should pay 33% of the bills , thats a fair division when you make twice as much as her (if the genders were reversed same answer)\n\nSo your offer of just 25% is still lowballing it\n\nShe is the selfish one, this should become a big deal to you", "NTA. But your gf sure the hell is. If you were asking her to pay 50/50 I\u2019d get why she\u2019s upset, but you\u2019re not, and frankly only putting 250 towards your combined bills every month is pathetic. Your gf is taking advantage of you.", "NTA you wouldn't even be TA if you asked her to go halves. If she's getting \u00a31450 a month, gives you \u00a3250, that means for a car and phone she's paying \u00a31200, sounds like she's getting ripped off and should look at something cheaper.", "NTA, sit her down and talk as these type of issues make or break a relationship.\n\nYou are more than understanding with her situation and does not mean you should be left with no money at the end of the day because you have to support her, she should understand that if you guys break up, her lifestyle will turn sour really quick.", "Nta that is fair.", "My husband and I worked out \u201chousehold income less household expenses\u201d then divided the balance by two.

Making double minimum wage is not like one partner making $300K a year and the other making $50K a year. You're hardly making more money than her and it should have been 50/50 for everything from the start. \n\nIt's her responsibility to be able to take care of herself, not yours. If she can't do that on her salary she needs to develop a skill or find a job where she can. What would she do if she wasn't with you? Be homeless? She's taking advantage of you.", "Info:\n\nYou mention renovations and a mortgage .... Is this your house or a joint house?\n\nWhile she should be paying proportionally utilities and food etc, if she's not an owner of the house then she shouldnt be paying for renovations, taxes, upkeep etc. She should be paying a reasonable portion for her contribution for \"rent\" but the full ownership cost of the house should not be equally attributed to her.\n\nIf she pays her own car, her own cell home and a portion of her food costs ( you say she provides her own lunches) then those are also part of her expenses. \n\nYou need to really sit down and figure out what proportion of each expense is fair. Each expense isnt necessary 50:50, or whatever proportion you determine. \n\nBut she has to be willing to actually sit down and discuss this with you as a partner. She can't just throw a tantrum and say no it's my way or the high way.", "NTA and I would seriously rethink this relationship if your partner calls you selfish when you ask her to contribute more. Honestly even if the splits were 50/50, there may come times where a partner has to do more than that and they absolutely should be expected to do that in certain situations.

After some communication work from both of us we sat down and did a budget taking into account both our take home income, expenses, priorities. At the time I made about $40k USD more than her salary, so our solution was to estimate the monthly joint expenditure (rent, insurance etc) and we would each be responsible for a proportion of that spending according to the ratio of our salaries out of the whole (45%/55% at that time). When she got a better paying job, we ran the numbers again and now split household expense equally. Turns out the arguments were because she had been afraid to take a hard look at her own spending habits, and doing that exercise made us both more aware of where our own money was going and also validated that we were a partnership. Living together in harmony definitely takes work on both sides and a willingness to be flawed in front of someone else.
