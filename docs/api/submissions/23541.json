Slowly the region where we live has become essentially impossible to afford. To put another way, cost-of-living here is just crazy. With this in mind, my brother moved down South just before I got married and my parents followed him a year after.\n\nEverything from housing to gas is cheaper there. I had always been super curious about moving there but since we both had jobs here and friends here, I never discussed the idea and kept it in my mind. Then, a year and a half ago my closest friends left with their families following the pandemic. In this last year, I have felt completely isolated. I don't have my family around nor my friends and the bills are biting into everything I have. I can neither afford to live here nor do I want to. I leave the house for my job and while I keep in contact with my friends, my wife's friends have essentially become my \"friends\". With this in mind, I floated the idea to my wife to move about 7 months ago but she shot it down (Edit: This was when I said I want to move to Texas and really told her how badly I wanted to move). She said she had family here, friends here, her job was here etc. She even said she wanted to raise our future-kids here.\n\nThen it dawned on me that we simply couldn't afford kids here. I told her I needed to leave as I felt suffocated here. She said she understood and she recommended therapy and I tried it for 3 months but it didn't help. Then we went down south two months ago for a my mom's birthday (we stayed there for a week) and it felt like home. I didn't want to leave and a dread sat in when I realized I had to.\n\nAt this point, just to satiate my desire, I asked my employer if there was a possibility for me to relocate to our Texas office (close to where my family lives luckily). They had no problem with it and at this point, I had my mind made up. I told my wife that I simply couldn't take it anymore and that I had to leave. She said she won't and I told her that she had a month to decide after which I would file for a divorce. I told her we could split the house (and we have no children) and everything else. I told her I just couldn't live like a zombie anymore and that everyday feels worse and worse.\n\nThis, understandably, broke out into a massive fight and I ended up leaving the house. I slept in a hotel for the night. Its been 3 weeks since and I've found an apartment to rent that is close to my family and my job down south and I'll use it while I look for a home (all of them are much cheaper than here).\n\nMy wife has been trying to convince me to stay but I just can't. Moreover, I'm getting constant calls from all of her family calling me an asshole for doing this to her.

It\u2019s real hard to compromise on where to live when you\u2019ve each got a particular place you want to be and they\u2019re not within reasonable commuting distance.

On top of that, her and her friends and family are literally harassing him about this shit and are trying to bully him into submission. In my opinion, the ultimatum was way more than fair.
