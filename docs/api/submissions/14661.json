A couple of years after we reconnected, Julie moved into town and Paul introduced us. Julie and I had instant chemistry and she asked me out, I told her I\u2019d get back to her after I had checked it was okay with Paul and wouldn\u2019t make him feel weird. I asked Paul if he was okay with it and he assured me that he very much was, and that he was the one who encouraged Julie to ask me out in the first place.

He told me he had been in love with me for years and that seeing me in my dress overwhelmed him and that he realised the mistake he made introducing me to Julie all of those years ago bc I should be with him. Obviously, I was upset. I told him introducing me to the love of my life wasn\u2019t a mistake and that I needed space and asked him to leave. \n\n2 days later I texted him telling him he was no longer part of my bridal party and that I have to tell Julie what he said but I think it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll agree that it\u2019s best he doesn\u2019t attend at all. I planned to tell Julie when she got home from work. Paul got there first. He told her we had a massive fight and I had been spreading lies about him. She didn\u2019t believe him, ofc. When I told her what happened, she was in shock. She immediately called Paul who denied everything. He was quite convincing and I told him to cute the BS. Julie said she needed some space to process, which I understood. I called Paul the next day and told him he needed to grow up and admit to Julie what happened, not bc she deserves to know the truth of what he said (more than what I can fit in this post). \n\nThis has caused a huge divide in our bridal parties and friends.

It seems likely to me that he\u2019s not actually in love with you and probably doesn\u2019t really believe that you should be with him.

I\u2019m sure he loves you and wants you to be happy and maybe he\u2019s just a little sad that he\u2019s not that for you and he doesn\u2019t have a love in his life like the one you have- even if he doesn\u2019t really want that for the two of you. \n\n7 years of friendship is impossible to hide a desire like that. If it was genuine- you would know. If he was secretly harboring \u201cI wish I could stay with you\u201d after your movie nights- you would\u2019ve picked up on it. The fact that it came as an outpouring after seeing your dress makes me think he\u2019s having a personal come apart that is more like misplaced emotional vomit. \n\nMaybe give him a chance to explain what the heck is really going on and tell him that he\u2019s being an idiot.

This lack of communication and unilateral decision making is not a great foundation to your upcoming marriage.

He was a great friend to you for years and you dropped him completely, uninvited him to the wedding and and to blow up his relationship with his sister. He didn't ask you to act on his feelings. He just confessed to his best friend.\n\nI think you blew up a lot of relationships needlessly. He didn't kiss you or ask anything of you. It is always good to be loved and it is always hard to be rejected. You could have been really gracious and said something like, \"Thank you for telling me that. I know it was hard to say. You are my best friend and I will always be grateful to you for giving me the love of my life, and making you my brother. I can wait until the right woman comes into your life. She'll be so lucky to have you.\"\n\nFix this.", "NTA he is but I am definitely subscribing to this because I really want an update I hope everything works out for you I can't believe he done that from now on record all conversations with him there are a load of secret apps you can download on your phone from play store or app store that can let you record and nobody will know", "NTA.

Stating that that isn\u2019t her intention is just an excuse to sound more morally right. She wouldn\u2019t be wrong for trying to do so though but she should just admit that she does want to undo the wrongs that he did in addition to hurting him as a form of revenge.", "WTH are you talking about? He hurt himself AND her. She is trying to undo the her hurting part. If that hurts him, tough titties. He brought that on himself. Why would she want ylto hurt him, he was her best friend untill this shitshow happened.", "You said it, he WAS her best friend until this incident. Imagine yourself in her place, some guy whom you rejected got butthurt and went on to spread harmful lies about you, could you still expect her to call him her best friend. And after that, it\u2019s only natural that she would want to fix her reputation and in turn, ruin his. Both the intent of undoing and the intent of reprimanding are there. Nothing wrong with that"]}
