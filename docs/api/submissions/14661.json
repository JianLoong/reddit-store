A couple of years after we reconnected, Julie moved into town and Paul introduced us. Julie and I had instant chemistry and she asked me out, I told her I\u2019d get back to her after I had checked it was okay with Paul and wouldn\u2019t make him feel weird. I asked Paul if he was okay with it and he assured me that he very much was, and that he was the one who encouraged Julie to ask me out in the first place. Our first date was fantastic, and 5 years later we\u2019re getting married. \n\nI wore my wedding dress for my bridal party (including Paul) yesterday for the first time since I ordered it during Covid and they\u2019ve never seen me wear it before.

He told me he had been in love with me for years and that seeing me in my dress overwhelmed him and that he realised the mistake he made introducing me to Julie all of those years ago bc I should be with him. Obviously, I was upset. I told him introducing me to the love of my life wasn\u2019t a mistake and that I needed space and asked him to leave. \n\n2 days later I texted him telling him he was no longer part of my bridal party and that I have to tell Julie what he said but I think it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll agree that it\u2019s best he doesn\u2019t attend at all. I planned to tell Julie when she got home from work. Paul got there first. He told her we had a massive fight and I had been spreading lies about him. She didn\u2019t believe him, ofc. When I told her what happened, she was in shock. She immediately called Paul who denied everything. He was quite convincing and I told him to cute the BS. Julie said she needed some space to process, which I understood. I called Paul the next day and told him he needed to grow up and admit to Julie what happened, not bc she deserves to know the truth of what he said (more than what I can fit in this post). \n\nThis has caused a huge divide in our bridal parties and friends. Everyone agrees that uninviting him was right. But some say me asking him to tell her everything he said is adding insult to injury.

He admitted to always secretly hoping we\u2019d break up, and that he regrets introducing us, that he had originally planned to object at the wedding but he couldn\u2019t wait any longer. I told my fianc\u00e9e who agreed we should uninvite him but he denied everything. She was torn and I told him to admit to everything he told me bc she deserves to know the truth.

But I would suggest stopping all contzct with him for now. Unless at family events then be cordial.\n\nThe more you try to pressure him into telling the truth the more he's going to shut down and the more you look bad.

I very much enjoyed this fictional story.", "NTA for uninviting and NTA for being truthful with your future spouse. Things like that have a way of getting out. It\u2019s  better to come clean and discuss it now before the wedding. Paul is the AH here, this isn\u2019t a rom com where you dump the fianc\u00e9e you love for her brother and somehow everyone lives happily ever after. He should have kept his feelings to himself, what he did was incredibly selfish, now potentially no one ends up happy.", "NTA - Paul can pound sand. As satisfying as it sounds, having him fess up might miss its mark if it's a captive audience situation for your fianc\u00e9 and she's not ready for it.\n\nPaul's already the dick.
