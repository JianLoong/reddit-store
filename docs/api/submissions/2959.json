I'm back on this account to give you guys an update. I really appreciate the support you guys gave me.\n\nI talked to my parents about options with Frederick the morning after I posted, since I posted late at night since I couldn't sleep. In the end, after some convincing, I am now staying with my grandparents, along with Frederick (my snake for those of you who didn't read the original post)\n\nMy parents jumped on the idea, and since I do online school and they live so close by I was able to switch pretty quickly. As a family, we have decided that this is the best for everyone. My parents agreed that the house was overcrowded, and my step-siblings-to-be couldn't live with Frederick, and I refused to part with him.\n\nIn the end, my two step-sisters moved into the office, my parents moved that stuff into their room, and I moved to my grandparents' house. Today I came home and got more of my things, and this will be our arrangement until my parents can get a new, bigger house.\n\nSo in the end, Frederick is safe and everyone is happy! Everything has been going well so far, but it's only been a few days. Hopefully, everything stays good!", "created_utc": 1669129370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1vstr/update_aita_for_refusing_to_get_rid_of_my_pet/", "score": 2079, "replies": ["Happy to hear it worked out for you, still shocked that your own mother chose her step kids over her own bio child. \n\nHonestly though, all that matters is that you get to keep Frederick and have your own safe space at your grandparents house ( what rockstars they are ).\n\nGood luck op, hope everything continues to work out for you and Frederick.", "This is very sad. Your mom tossing you aside to please her new family breaks my heart. She should be ashamed of herself.", "I\u2019m happy you are happy\u2026. but I have to ask; did your mom really not put up any sort of fight to keep you at home, any other compromise at all? I hope your sister is ok with the situation too", "Glad things worked out. I will probably get downvoted for this but your mom is still an AH in this situation. What kind of parent pushes out their minor child? Biggest AH is your mom, and will always be the AH.", "I\u2019m sorry. I still think your mom is a huge AH for choosing kids that aren\u2019t hers over you. She should be ashamed.", "Pet tax would be much appreciated :)", "This is both sad and good to hear.\n\nI'm glad you're getting the space you need and that you're still close to your parents. Make sure that you're still spending quality time with them, have dinner at their place, stay in the loop, etc.", "Glad you didn\u2019t have to give up your pet. Your mom is still a desperate for a man asshole though.

I'm happy you're going to keep your pet.", "I mean, I'm glad it sorta worked out but, kinda sad that your mother basically tossed you aside for step kids feelings instead of yours.. hope everything is good from here on", "Awesome. Glad you found a solution.", "Is it weird of me to hope that the stepsisters to be find this post and see how much of A Hs they were to OP and it gets to his mom and she feels bad that she put her own son through all this???? \n\nI\u2019m happy OP is happy but man. Such unnecessary drama over a snake that (I believe) never leaves OP\u2019s room.\n\nETA: omg I forgot that OP has a sister too!!!! And she\u2019s also unhappy of the changing dynamics!!! WOW.", "Glad to hear you still have Frederick", "I missed your original post, but glad to see a happy-ish ending.

Thank goodness they heard you. Pets are family!", "Glad it worked out!", "Great stuff, good solution for all", "Good on you man!", "I\u2019m glad you were able to find a solution that works for everyone. I didn\u2019t see the original post, but here\u2019s my take:\n\nI used to be irrationally afraid of snakes, to the point where I wouldn\u2019t enjoy hiking because I was too scared to possibly come across a snake. It got to the point where I realized I was being ridiculous, and I actively tried to learn more about snakes. I joined several snake and reptile pages and saw how people interacted with their pet snakes. I figured out that snakes aren\u2019t that scary. \n\nI would encourage your siblings to educate themselves on ball pythons so they can see how shy they are. The saying \u201cknowledge is power\u201d really is true.", "Glad it worked out and your parents listened to you.", "Hell yeah. Btw you got pics of Fred?", "So happy you and Frederick are safe and happy!", "OP. I don\u2019t like snakes either. Terribly afraid of them but this isn\u2019t a happy ending for you at all. You were forced out of your home for wanting to keep your pet. Your mom and step dad created this situation by bringing 4 people into a (maybe) 4 bedroom house so they could play happy family. The fact that your mom is okay with this is heartbreaking and I\u2019m happy you have your grandparents because you might need to depend on them rather than your parents in the future.", "Yay!  I\u2019m so happy to hear this!", "Sounds like being with the grandparents truly is what\u2019s best for OP, since Mom is clearly more eager to prioritize her \u201cnew\u201d family. Hate parents that pull stuff like this\u2026", "I'm also shocked...", "I\u2019m honestly not shocked she chose her step kids + fianc\u00e9 over her own kid, Reddit has severely lowered my expectations on blended families", "She didn't want me to leave at first, but she didn't want to figure something else out, so I convinced her. And even if she did just throw me away as other people have said, I don't really care. All I care about is that I'm still with Frederick.", "Totally agree", "Agreed. Why didn\u2019t they just save up for longer until they can afford a bigger place then all move in together?", "I'm actually wondering if the mother and new guy will EVER get a new house.", "I agree she\u2019s a huge AH", "I'm on chrome on mobile, so I can't send images :(", "Yes! I wanna see Frederick!", "I feel the same. I'm glad OP is happy with the solution. It's just... not ideal", "Nope. What kind of mother pushes out her OWN MINOR CHILD? I rather not have a mother like that in my life.", "Actually it sounds more like mom couldn't wait to have him leave, but if OP and Frederick are safe and happy, I guess it worked out.", "I hope OP stays with his grandparents. Imagine choosing a relationship over your own child.", "Yeh it\u2019s sad that it had to come to that though. I understand it\u2019s a new family dynamic and you have to make your step kids feel welcome and it\u2019s their home as well, but the way OPs mum handled this whole thing is honestly gross.", "Shocked that she jumped on it, like was excited for it. I don\u2019t see why the fianc\u00e9 and step kids couldn\u2019t be the ones to wait until they found a bigger house.", "And that\u2019s what matters most. What kind of snake is Frederick again? Sorry spotted this update and didn\u2019t read the first post. I love sneks but sadly wouldn\u2019t be able to care for one because I don\u2019t have the money. Give Frederick a boop for me though!", "I agree with you, but I imagine it will be easier to save when combining finances while sharing a single small space than with two separate spaces. \n\nThat being said, I do feel bad that OP is basically moved out of his family home when his mom remarried. It is a tough situation for all.", "\ud83d\udc0d Here's an artistic representation of Frederick.", "It's sad but at the same time, sometimes it does take a lot of love to have your kids be away from you so they can be in a better environment.\n\nI switched highschools due to the first highschool putting me into the worst depressive state I've ever been in. I ended up living with my Granddad and his wife away from my parents. They loved me and I called them all the time and went back home every other weekend to hang out with them.\n\nMy only thing with this whole situation is that the OP shouldn't expect for his family to get a bigger house. There's a huge chance that it's not going to happen before he's an adult.", "Sadly I don\u2019t have to. My Dad did it with his second marriage. We no longer speak. Stay with the grandparents for sure!", "I\u2019m just glad OP and his snek friend are somewhere safe! I\u2019m also thinking we need a snake tax on reddit", "I also desire to boop Frederick.", "Perfection", "Nope, I don\u2019t believe that bullshit. As a parent, your own child should come first. They shouldn\u2019t have moved in together. You choose to give birth to children. Children don\u2019t ask to be born.", "JFC. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that.", "I\u2019m sure the snake is beautiful but I live in Australia, so I have no desire to see anymore snakes on reddit\u2026 I spend enough time trying to survive and avoid them in real life lol. ( but please add snake tax so other people can see it! )", "My therapist makes a killing off it, bless her, but honestly I\u2019m glad I went no contact. I\u2019ve got a great support system in my chosen family and I\u2019m frankly doing fantastic- far better off without them! \n\nDef think about some therapy though OP, if only to help you adapt to the new dynamic.", "Oh man. Such a beautiful country but I\u2019ve seen how big your spiders get so no thanks \ud83e\udd23", "Hugs to you, babes. You're killing it.", "I have huge arachnophobia, so spiders are even worse then snakes for me\u2026 I blame my parents, they could of moved to a safer country!", "See I thought being in Canada would help me out, but the lil leggies just come moving into the house in winter. \n\nI've started moving them into the garage. There's this massive one in the corner I think is in charge... or just eating everyone else.", "Are the grandparents excited to have you?", "I\u2019m so happy you and Frederick get to stay together. And while other posters bring up valid points abt this family dynamic, I\u2019m just going to focus on the fact that you were clever and mature enough to figure out a solution to this problem that avoided the thing you feared most with minimal drama. Good for you.", "Your grandparents are the best.", "I'm glad you're happy and Fredrick is still with you.\n\nBut I cannot believe your own mother didn't sind with you or fight for what would make you happy. \nI would keep an eye on how easily your mother can compromise your, and your sisters happiness for the new step-children.\n\nWishing you the best OP tale care", "Your mother failed you", "This is how you lose relationships with your children.\n\nThey honestly should've prioritize buying a bigger house over a wedding.\n\nYour children come first. If that means you have to postpone moving in together, so be it.", "\u201cThey jumped at the idea\u201d\n\nDamn. Ouch. Can\u2019t even act like shipping their kid off over a pet that\u2019s never caused anyone problems was a hard decision?", "I\u2019m so glad you get to keep Frederick! I have 10 pet snakes at home and love all of them. I still think it\u2019s weird that your parent chose the step kids over you, but it sounds like you have something that works.", "Yay!!! Ngl I was worried for Frederick since your last post. Glad to see he gets to stay with his favorite person!", "OP, I am happy that you were able to find a solution that allowed you and Federick to stay together. I mean that sincerely.", "My dad did the same!! Cheated on my mom with a woman with five kids from two husbands!! Left us in poverty while they were living the good life! My step sister had the audacity to ask me why my mom can\u2019t get a job! Your mom made her choice!! You were not it!", "Happy to hear that you and Frederick have a safe home!", "Hoping for you can just stay at your grandparents. Your mom still sucks at all that. This also coming from someone who's deadly afraid of snakes.", "Wow your mother really let you go like that??", "So happy for you Op", "I'm happy that you kept the snake but it's weird that your mom didn't fight on your side to keep Fredrick\n\nThey didn't even try to compromise. It was just a straight up get rid of the snake and we will bribe you for it", "I'm glad you are happy and got to keep Frederick. Thanks for the update OP.", "While I personally would be a little anxious living in the same room with a snake, I\u2019m very happy to hear that you and Frederick will get to stay together!  I\u2019m especially happy for Frederick because he\u2019s in safe place with someone who clearly cares for his well being.", "Awesome!  Thank you for the update.  So glad everything worked out for you, Frederick and the rest of the family!", "I am so happy for you and Frederick. That is wonderful news.", "I\u2019m really glad your sister isn\u2019t going to have to share her room. And about you and Frederick.", "For a happy ending, this is depressing AF.\n\nYou got to keep your snake, OP. Way to keep your eye on the prize. Most would have been distracted by their mother having a family without them.", "Also, Frederick pics are required at this point", "I'm glad to hear it worked out for you!", "Info: does your mom plan to still come spend time with you?  What is her plan here?", "If you could do it safely, could we have snake tax, please?  I'm sure the snake is super cute.\n\nIf not, that is perfectly okay.", "I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t have to part with your snake. I hope you don\u2019t feel like your household didn\u2019t care about accommodating you with a pre-existing pet.

Hope you have lots of peace at your grand folks\u2019 home", "Your mother sounds awful, I'm so sorry.", "YAY!!! Happy update!! So glad you got to keep Freddy!!", "That's terrible that your mum jumped at the chance to have you move out so she could move a man in, shame on her!!!", "This is great.

I'm so glad you found a solution that works for you.", "I'm so happy to hear this worked out for everyone, including Frederick!

He moved them into his dads place till I was settled then moved them back without telling me (I asked to not be informed as my phobia doesn't allow for me to know they are there lol). It worked out super great. \n\nI'm so glad you all found a resolution that works.", "I would like snake tax in the form of a picture of said Frederick. it's only fair!

Thank you for updating us.", "This is good news! I'm happy for you.", "Very proud of you  <3 You communicated effectively and maturely, had your focus, and came up with a solution and got it presented and agreed to to protect your little buddy. I'm sorry your family is like this, but I'm glad your grandparents are supporting you. If you ever need any snake help, hit me up; I live with 5 ball pythons and have worked with many, many more. Good luck to you and Frederick!!!", "Yeah I kind feel she jumped on the idea because it's the path of least resistance, not because it's what best for op", "If the mom was so quick to jump on op living with grandparents, then I doubt they'll get that bigger house until after op goes to college. Never really sounded like the mom even wanted to live with op and seems to happy they're living with grandparents.", "Yeah, this is a sad update but not a surprising one.", "Everytime I read someone is \"shocked that your own mother would choose INSERT THING OF CHOICE HERE over her own bio child...\" I think,  what a lucky person that is to have a life that afforded them that mentality.  \n\nI sincerely hope that you never experience a reason for you to lose that heart.", "She chose them over a snake.

That line disgusted me", "There are some creatures I\u2019m terribly afraid of, but if it\u2019s someone\u2019s pet, as long as they keep it away from me, we\u2019re cool. His step-siblings\u2019 refusal to even be in the same HOUSE with the snake is just ridiculous. A good parent would have squashed that off the bat. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like snakes; you don\u2019t have to touch it or look at it. It can live in a different room, and you just stay out of that room. No one will make you go into the snake\u2019s room unless you ask to see the snake. But this house is the snake\u2019s house, too, so he\u2019s going to be in the house with us. Just keep away from his room, and OP will make sure to let you know if he\u2019s going to take him out of the room, so you can stay away.\u201d As long as you reassure the kids that they\u2019ll never have to interact with the snake unless THEY choose to, then they\u2019ll soon get over being afraid of being in the same house with it.", ">Make sure that you're still spending quality time with them, have dinner at their place, stay in the loop, etc.\n\nThat's on the OP's mom. She's already made the choice once to put her child last, now its time to see if that becomes a pattern.", "Why? So they can see first hand how the new family comes first?", "Yeah. They're really awesome, not just as in being cool, but they literally inspire awe for me.", "Thanks you for the update.  You were on my mind.  You are a wonder.  You are young and strong and kind.  Your grandparents are lucky to have you around and Frederick is safe.  You have a bright future, OP.  Cheers.", "There is no way ever I'll have my kids move out for other kids to move in.", "Seriously if the house is going to be that overcrowded put off on moving in tougher until they can secure a bigger house to accommodate everyone.", "Yes! I want to see Frederick!", "Which indicates that it probably *is* what's best for OP.", "Yeh agreed, I feel sorry for Op but a bigger house is definitely not going to happen. \n\nIt worked out perfectly for everyone else, step sisters got their own room, parents got the own room and the stepbrother got OPs old room to himself and op got shipped out. It actually makes me mad, I bet this was OPs new stepdads plan from the start\u2026", "What a strange comment, you seriously attacking me because I find it shocking and disgusting that a parent would choose a man and his kids over their own bio kid?", "No she chose them over her own child. Op suggested multiple solutions and they all got shot down. \n\nI was in a similar situation, my daughter has Guinea pigs and my stepdaughter was absolutely petrified of them. Instead of forcing my daughter to get rid of her beloved pets, we sat down and worked out a solution to make everyone happy. \n\n3 years later and everyone is still in the house happy, along with the Guinea pigs.", "They won't, and then when OP is grown up and successful they will try to get money out of them.", "sad :(\n\nAt least give Frederick a lot of love from all of us!", "Ohh man, I worked at a homeless shelter,  and it happens so much more often than people realize.", "Aw, that\u2019s so sweet! I\u2019m glad you have such amazing grandparents!", "Prev post said he is a ball python", "He's a ball python.", "Its a die hard issue for me. I can't imagine even picking my husband over my kids.  Its like picking him over having my arms and legs to me.", "This is very sad.", "Same.", "If I remember correctly, OP is a teenager and will be moving out in a few years anyway. Honestly I think it\u2019s horrible his mom would rather kick out her son that just wait to cohabitate. I don\u2019t blame the other kids for not wanting to live with a snake. I blame the parents for being selfish in their desire to live together and forcing too many kids and animals into too small a space. I have a family member who married a man with kids. They dated for many heads before marriage, because they both took adding a new family member into equation very seriously (even though only her new husband had kids, not her). When they did marry she moved in with him in a small house he lived in to be close to his kids (they were teenagers at that point and went back and forth frequently). My point is there\u2019s no need to rush this living situation when being patient and residing in their previous homes could have meant everyone was comfortable, at least until\nOP was 18.", "The masses have spoken! Show us the adorable snake friend!", "Me too! I checked OP's comment because I was sure that there must have been requests for snek tax on the original post, but I didn't see one.\n\nNot paying pet tax should be an auto YTA (absolutely joking but pet tax should be paid!)", "I'm just saying guinea pigs are not scary like snakes!", "boopable snoot", "I will :)", "You moved away from your parents for *your* benefit though, whereas OP had to move for his mum and the new step-family's benefits.

If you'd like to pay the pet tax, we'd all love to see a picture of him!", "Freaking adorable. He is a precious noodle. Protecc him.", "Same! Except Dad and I still speak. Just\u2026about nothing anymore. I basically visit him and his wife\u2019s place so my younger stepsister and I can hang out. She told me herself that my brother and I are the only siblings she truly considers siblings. Pretty crappy all around.\n\nIt really sucks when a parent suddenly decides a whole different family is the favorite!", "Agreed, I\u2019m not blaming the step siblings. They are kids also. But as parents, they should of came to a conclusion that suited everyone. I mean op and Frederick was there first, why should they be the ones to suffer.", "Are you seriously gatekeeping what people can and cannot be scared of? Really\u2026 also snakes aren\u2019t scary and ball pythons are harmless.", "These are the same parents that didn't even consider getting rid of the office space until OP talked with them. Cramming three girls into one room made more sense in their minds than moving the stuff. I'm glad OP is in a supportive place and has their snake buddy with them.", "It\u2019s bittersweet to spend so much money and time fixing something you didn\u2019t break.

Reptile owners have to be SO attentive to their pets too because they don't bark and whine and wag their tails like dogs. You have to study them, observe them closely, etc. It creates such a strong bond of care.\n\nAnd ball pythons live roughly 20 years, longer than most dogs! Where do they think he will end up? Re-adopted? Not likely unfortunately. The implication that you could get a \"new one\" rather than be reunited in a few years also shows that they straight up wanted Frederick to die to make it easier on them.

Granted, I'm almost 30 and live on my own, but I did get my two snakes when I was still living with my mom a few years ago, much to her dismay. Now that I have my own home, I keep them in the third bedroom which acts as a storage + snake room (I call it the \"snorage\" room ehehe). If nobody wants to see them, I close the door and the others can mind their business. If somebody doesn't want to come see me because of snakes in the house, that's their problem. But I do work to fight the stigma. Some people have such an unnecessary, visceral opinion of snakes that is completely unfounded and even harmful.\n\nIt's sad you had to leave your family, and only you know how healthy the dynamic is between you, your mom, and your new extended family, but good on you for standing your ground. Snakes are a long commitment, and I can tell Frederick is in good hands. I hope things continue to go well for you, and I hope you can have/maintain a good relationship with your family.", "Yeah, exactly, terrible.", "I know right. I'm shocked as well. All of a sudden the office can be used and the mum was like \"ok bye\" \nYikes. \n\nBut all in all I am really glad Frederick doesn't have to go.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If I had a nickel for every post I read that was like \"my parent loves me, but once they got remarried they forgot I existed and put all of their effort into their ~new family so our relationship is strained now, but.... \"", "Reddit has severely lowered my expectations on humanity in general...", "Oh I'm sorry, I guess I'm forgetting the part where she also kicked her bio daughter out on the curb too.\n\nOP used \"very close\" to describe the location of his grandparents house. He's a teenager and soon will be leaving his house to be an adult. Some separation is okay. I'm giving advice for him to not cut his mom out of his life.\n\nYeah she needs to be the one making the effort to stay in touch but OP hopefully shouldn't be resentful.", "He is temporarily going to his grandparents' house until they get a bigger house. And he gets to keep his animal. The move to grandparents was suggested in the comments and he thought it was a good idea and was going to ask because keeping the snake was his priority. They could have foced him to give up the animal which is not what he wanted.", "My dad straight up replaced me and my brother with his long-term girlfriends kids. He couldn't afford xmas or birthday presents for us, but his step kids each got an Xbox. Hell he took his new family to our state for some reason and drove them *by our house to see where we lived* and didn't even tell us that he was in town. Of course my dad straight up told my mom he doesn't like me and he told me to my face that he doesn't trust me. But he's a MAGA transphobe racist. Me and my cousin are trans, plus I dared have a child while not married and am mentally ill, and was openly queer so I got written off while a teen. My brother got disowned and blocked on SM for marrying a Mexican who has half black children. My brother never came out to our parents but he is also Lgbtq, he just happens to be in a straight passing marriage.", "Imagine choosing a *snake* over your parents.", "It\u2019s heartbreaking reading those", "5Head", "I bet so too, step dad either told stories to make the kids afraid or told them that they could have their own rooms if they helped get rid of op. Step dad probably thought that younger siblings would be more easily to manipulate and fall in line to his controlling parenting, without op in the way.", "It's not an attack of you. I think, at least for me from a similar viewpoint, it's a bit of jealousy that you are shocked. It's means that you have not been exposed to this yourself. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being shocked, it's more that I feel sorry for people who are no longer shocked because for them it's become normal.", "What she did was awful. She basically forced her underage son to move out so she could live with her partner. It was unbelievably selfish of her to do this. Wait until you have a large enough living space to adequately house everyone, don't force your own teenage son out of the house just so you can live with your boyfriend/husband. This is absolutely grounds for cutting her out of his life if he so chooses.", "Throw in a boop from me as well!", "I\u2019m low contact with my mom for the same reason. Sending hugs.", "Well the thing is sometimes humans are worse than snakes ;) even your own parent who will gladly throw you away for their new family", "His own mother chose her step children over them,  there should never have been a question over them removing their snake. It was hard enough that they were being expected to share a room. The mother and step father should have waited until either the op left home, what they suggested was absolutely disgusting behaviour.", "There's also another adult, two more girls & a younger boy in the house.  It may be more relaxing to move in with the gp's. His sister may end up moving too so the step sisters can each have a room.", "Over that mom? Yeah. LOL 100% I\u2019m going snake.", "I have been in very similar situations. once growing up and once as the parent, only I didn\u2019t ship my own bio kid off unlike OPs mum.", "No.  She chose her partner over a snake.  A snake.  \n\nA snake that will either disposed of or will be dead when the teen leaves for college anyway.", "Both of those are scary to me. It's not for you to tell me what I should or should not be afraid if, and vice versa.\n\nWhich was my actual point but I give up. I do feel for those kids.", "You are joking right? You are saying I shouldn\u2019t tell you what to be afraid of or not. But you just did say the same in regards to my stepdaughter and Guinea pigs\u2026 come on..\n\nAnd you feel sorry for the step kids but not the kid that was forced to move out of his own home?  Alrighty then!!", "Never thought about therapy like this and ouch... if ain't that the truth? Not to mention paying for meds that are out needed cause someone else messed up. :')", "Don't put words in my mouth, that's lying.\n\nYes, I feel bad for all the kids. Even more now that I know you love the pets more than them, \ud83d\ude02", "Pretty much exact same, friend. I\u2019m mad proud of and impressed by you and wish us all well on our healing journeys.", "I mean either way it's a win if they keep the others out of the house", "I\u2019m not one to usually call people weird but you are very weird, how did you leap to the conclusion that I love pets more then my own children? \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of Guinea pigs but I still let my daughter have them when she asked.\n\nYou are clearly here to troll, please go troll someone else.", "And the same to you!"]}
