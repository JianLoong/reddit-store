I'm back on this account to give you guys an update. I really appreciate the support you guys gave me.\n\nI talked to my parents about options with Frederick the morning after I posted, since I posted late at night since I couldn't sleep. In the end, after some convincing, I am now staying with my grandparents, along with Frederick (my snake for those of you who didn't read the original post)\n\nMy parents jumped on the idea, and since I do online school and they live so close by I was able to switch pretty quickly. As a family, we have decided that this is the best for everyone. My parents agreed that the house was overcrowded, and my step-siblings-to-be couldn't live with Frederick, and I refused to part with him.\n\nIn the end, my two step-sisters moved into the office, my parents moved that stuff into their room, and I moved to my grandparents' house. Today I came home and got more of my things, and this will be our arrangement until my parents can get a new, bigger house.\n\nSo in the end, Frederick is safe and everyone is happy! Everything has been going well so far, but it's only been a few days. Hopefully, everything stays good!", "created_utc": 1669129370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1vstr/update_aita_for_refusing_to_get_rid_of_my_pet/", "score": 348, "replies": ["Happy to hear it worked out for you, still shocked that your own mother chose her step kids over her own bio child. \n\nHonestly though, all that matters is that you get to keep Frederick and have your own safe space at your grandparents house ( what rockstars they are ).\n\nGood luck op, hope everything continues to work out for you and Frederick.", "This is very sad. Your mom tossing you aside to please her new family breaks my heart. She should be ashamed of herself.", "I\u2019m happy you are happy\u2026. but I have to ask; did your mom really not put up any sort of fight to keep you at home, any other compromise at all? I hope your sister is ok with the situation too", "Glad things worked out. I will probably get downvoted for this but your mom is still an AH in this situation. What kind of parent pushes out their minor child? Biggest AH is your mom, and will always be the AH.", "I\u2019m sorry. I still think your mom is a huge AH for choosing kids that aren\u2019t hers over you. She should be ashamed.", "Pet tax would be much appreciated :)", "This is both sad and good to hear.\n\nI'm glad you're getting the space you need and that you're still close to your parents. Make sure that you're still spending quality time with them, have dinner at their place, stay in the loop, etc.", "Glad you didn\u2019t have to give up your pet. Your mom is still a desperate for a man asshole though. Who allows their kid to move out of the house they were staying at first before the man and his kids came into the picture??", "That's great news! Enjoy as much independence as you can. I'm happy you're going to keep your pet.", "I mean, I'm glad it sorta worked out but, kinda sad that your mother basically tossed you aside for step kids feelings instead of yours.. hope everything is good from here on", "Awesome. Glad you found a solution.", "Is it weird of me to hope that the stepsisters to be find this post and see how much of A Hs they were to OP and it gets to his mom and she feels bad that she put her own son through all this???? \n\nI\u2019m happy OP is happy but man. Such unnecessary drama over a snake that (I believe) never leaves OP\u2019s room.\n\nETA: omg I forgot that OP has a sister too!!!! And she\u2019s also unhappy of the changing dynamics!!! WOW.", "Glad to hear you still have Frederick", "I missed your original post, but glad to see a happy-ish ending.  Life throws curveballs, and it sounds like you & your family are making the best of it.", "You shouldn\u2019t have had to move out of your home because of a pet but I\u2019m SO glad that you and Frederick are happy and have a good place to stay.", "I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t have to say goodbye to your beloved Frederick! Thank goodness they heard you. Pets are family!", "Glad it worked out!", "Great stuff, good solution for all", "Good on you man!", "I\u2019m glad you were able to find a solution that works for everyone. I didn\u2019t see the original post, but here\u2019s my take:\n\nI used to be irrationally afraid of snakes, to the point where I wouldn\u2019t enjoy hiking because I was too scared to possibly come across a snake. It got to the point where I realized I was being ridiculous, and I actively tried to learn more about snakes. I joined several snake and reptile pages and saw how people interacted with their pet snakes. I figured out that snakes aren\u2019t that scary. \n\nI would encourage your siblings to educate themselves on ball pythons so they can see how shy they are. The saying \u201cknowledge is power\u201d really is true.", "Glad it worked out and your parents listened to you.", "Hell yeah. Btw you got pics of Fred?", "So happy you and Frederick are safe and happy!", "OP. I don\u2019t like snakes either. Terribly afraid of them but this isn\u2019t a happy ending for you at all. You were forced out of your home for wanting to keep your pet. Your mom and step dad created this situation by bringing 4 people into a (maybe) 4 bedroom house so they could play happy family. The fact that your mom is okay with this is heartbreaking and I\u2019m happy you have your grandparents because you might need to depend on them rather than your parents in the future.", "Yay!  I\u2019m so happy to hear this!", "Sounds like being with the grandparents truly is what\u2019s best for OP, since Mom is clearly more eager to prioritize her \u201cnew\u201d family. Hate parents that pull stuff like this\u2026", "I'm also shocked...", "I\u2019m honestly not shocked she chose her step kids + fianc\u00e9 over her own kid, Reddit has severely lowered my expectations on blended families", "She didn't want me to leave at first, but she didn't want to figure something else out, so I convinced her. And even if she did just throw me away as other people have said, I don't really care. All I care about is that I'm still with Frederick.", "Totally agree", "Agreed. Why didn\u2019t they just save up for longer until they can afford a bigger place then all move in together?", "I'm actually wondering if the mother and new guy will EVER get a new house.", "I agree she\u2019s a huge AH", "I'm on chrome on mobile, so I can't send images :(", "Yes! I wanna see Frederick!", "I feel the same. I'm glad OP is happy with the solution. It's just... not ideal", "Nope. What kind of mother pushes out her OWN MINOR CHILD? I rather not have a mother like that in my life.", "Actually it sounds more like mom couldn't wait to have him leave, but if OP and Frederick are safe and happy, I guess it worked out.", "I hope OP stays with his grandparents. Imagine choosing a relationship over your own child.", "Yeh it\u2019s sad that it had to come to that though. I understand it\u2019s a new family dynamic and you have to make your step kids feel welcome and it\u2019s their home as well, but the way OPs mum handled this whole thing is honestly gross.", "Shocked that she jumped on it, like was excited for it. I don\u2019t see why the fianc\u00e9 and step kids couldn\u2019t be the ones to wait until they found a bigger house.", "And that\u2019s what matters most. What kind of snake is Fredrick again? Sorry spotted this update and didn\u2019t read the first post. I love sneks but sadly wouldn\u2019t be able to care for one because I don\u2019t have the money. Give Fredrick a boop for me though!", "I agree with you, but I imagine it will be easier to save when combining finances while sharing a single small space than with two separate spaces. \n\nThat being said, I do feel bad that OP is basically moved out of his family home when his mom remarried. It is a tough situation for all.", "\ud83d\udc0d Here's an artistic representation of Frederick.", "It's sad but at the same time, sometimes it does take a lot of love to have your kids be away from you so they can be in a better environment.\n\nI switched highschools due to the first highschool putting me into the worst depressive state I've ever been in. I ended up living with my Granddad and his wife away from my parents. They loved me and I called them all the time and went back home every other weekend to hang out with them.\n\nMy only thing with this whole situation is that the OP shouldn't expect for his family to get a bigger house. There's a huge chance that it's not going to happen before he's an adult.", "Sadly I don\u2019t have to. My Dad did it with his second marriage. We no longer speak. Stay with the grandparents for sure!", "I\u2019m just glad OP and his snek friend are somewhere safe! I\u2019m also thinking we need a snake tax on reddit", "I also desire to boop Frederick.", "Perfection", "Nope, I don\u2019t believe that bullshit. As a parent, your own child should come first. They shouldn\u2019t have moved in together. You choose to give birth to children. Children don\u2019t ask to be born.", "JFC. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that.", "I\u2019m sure the snake is beautiful but I live in Australia, so I have no desire to see anymore snakes on reddit\u2026 I spend enough time trying to survive and avoid them in real life lol. ( but please add snake tax so other people can see it! )", "My therapist makes a killing off it, bless her, but honestly I\u2019m glad I went no contact. I\u2019ve got a great support system in my chosen family and I\u2019m frankly doing fantastic- far better off without them! \n\nDef think about some therapy though OP, if only to help you adapt to the new dynamic.", "Oh man. Such a beautiful country but I\u2019ve seen how big your spiders get so no thanks \ud83e\udd23", "Hugs to you, babes. You're killing it.", "I have huge arachnophobia, so spiders are even worse then snakes for me\u2026 I blame my parents, they could of moved to a safer country!", "See I thought being in Canada would help me out, but the lil leggies just come moving into the house in winter. \n\nI've started moving them into the garage. There's this massive one in the corner I think is in charge... or just eating everyone else."]}
