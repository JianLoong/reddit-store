About a week ago, I was talking with Mark and his wife, Leah (not real name) who asked me about the catering at the wedding. Apparently the whole family really liked it, and they were interested in hiring the restaurant for a Christmas party or something.\n\nI gave them the contact info and figured that would be it, but not two days later, my wife got a pretty angry text from her grandmother saying that we \"caused an argument\" between Mark and Leah, because Mark got upset about us \"tricking him into eating vegan food\" and Leah said it wasn't a big deal and he should get over it, so they had a fight.\n\nI'm inclined to agree with Leah here, but my wife is upset because her grandmother is upset, and now I'm not sure.

And they could easily also hire someone else to provide meat dishes, if they desired for their event.  \n\nThis is a stupid argument, and your wife's grandmother needs to not spread the drama because poor little Mark ate some vegetables and had a fit after he found out.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!", "NTA - I bet Mark is easily tricked.
