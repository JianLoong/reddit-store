Been together for 3 months and if we're not next to each other she's pretty much calling me, on the way to work, my lunch break, heading home, ect. And at first it was sorta cute hearing about her day and learning different things but after awhile she'd call me just to ask what she wore the Wednesday before or tell me she and her sister farted and laughed and just random nonsense while I'm trying to relax or even when I'm with family. \n\nSo I bring it up a few times in a nice way over the past month more and more frequently, and as time went on she'd shorten the time in between calling making it worse. So finally last Thursday I had a rough day at work, was in a bit of a mood all day and she calls me everything's fine I tell her hey I'm gonna hop on my game for a bit and spend time with my brother. Within ten mins she calls me to tell me she bought my grandpa 5 birthday cards for his 80th coming up. And I can feel myself get irritated but I just calmly get through the phone call and once I had privacy I let her know that this isn't okay, I voiced that it isn't okay as I feel suffocated from being called nonstop just for you to do it worse.\n\nI'm thinking that my issue here is valid and so far we haven't really fought over anything so worst case is she feels like I'm annoyed by her in which I'll work on ways to make her not feel like that if that's the case.... but oh no, she can't believe that I don't like being on the phone and this is just me using my past history against her. Which leads into her saying I smoke too much and play video games too much and I spend too much money and I never give her any alone time or attention.\n\nSo me being me I bottle up how I felt, told her I loved her and that we need to work on this type of communication. Day goes on grandpa's birthdays tomorrow early morning so I'm assuming she'd be coming over so we could get ready and leave together. I text to ask when she thought was best to come over and I get hit with 'I have plans' followed by being told she's going to the bar tonight, the same bar she told me she went to when she was single for fun.... so I ended things, feel kinda shitty as I might of over reacted and decided to write it down incase someone is bored enough to read this nonsense.\n\nTldr: gf of 3 months called me 5-7 times a day, I got annoyed and make a comment, she gets irritated and points out my every flaw, after I mend things she decides to go to the bar where she used to mingle at", "created_utc": 1667622250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymk0cn/aita_for_not_wanting_my_26m_gf26f_to_call_me_up/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Frankly she's calling too much. It's okay to tell your girlfriend that you want some friend/ family time and the fact that not only she doesn't respect your feelings, she also lashes out at you because you said something she didn't like.  This doesn't sound like a healthy relationship to me.", "NTA - it\u2019s good you broke up", "She's got anxiety and it manifests itself like this.\n\n\nThat's how mine works and she needs therapy.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d cut my losses. She\u2019s desperately clingy. On one hand calling you and telling you about inane things is clearly her love language, so obviously being told that your SO doesn\u2019t appreciate your love language is gonna hurt. And you did mention you bottled it up then blew up on her. On the other 7 times a day is ludicrous. \n\nWhy I say cut her off, is because of her childish reaction. I have plans I\u2019m going to the bar? She\u2019s trying to hurt you. Fuck that noise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You likely dodged a bullet with her anyway, not taking your feelings into consideration when you told her you felt suffocated. Everyone needs their \u201cme\u201d time.", "I'm going to say NTA because you ex didn't seem to understand basic boundaries, but I'm really tempted to put E S H because you were definitely an AH to \\*yourself\\*\n\n>So I bring it up a few times in a nice way over the past month more and more frequently, and as time went on she'd shorten the time in between calling making it worse. \n\nThis is the point you should have just said 'i'm sorry we don't seem to have compatible relationship goals' and broken up with her. Your ex seems unhinged, but you also don't seem to know how to navigate healthy relationship boundaries. That's not a dig okay? Building healthy relationships is a skill and part of that is knowing when to say \"wow this relationship is not making my life better\" and getting out.", "Exactly, she's perfectly fine to do whatever she wants, but when we have a pretty big argument and going to spend the day with my family the next day, you don't randomly make friends to go to a bar you haven't been to since we started dating as a jab knowing I'll get upset right?", "She stopped going to therapy and stopped taking her seizure medication a few months ago before we started dating, least that's what was explained", "That's actually what I'm trying to work on, her and her friend are basically saying I'm the bad guy because I'm not understanding to her past trauma and needs from a relationship. Her argument is she feels she should be able to call me without feeling like she's annoying me, in which I did state multiple times the bed time calls and after work calls and when ur lonely are completely fine and I love and cherish those calls as I feel like I'm of use vs pointless phone calls I feel like a toy being pressed until it breaks", "Oof... There is a definite connection.\n\nIt can be better with therapy but she has to put in the work and it seems like she doesn't want to.\n\nIt took me several years to deal with my separation anxiety but I was definitely willing to take the steps. And sometimes it returns.\n\nReevaluate the relationship. She is a mess of red flags.", "I think a big part of it is the friend, everytime she hangs out with this friend she starts on this sorta guy's should always treat their woman like a queen, in which I feel I abide by mostly. Not to mention the friends 1st of 7 boy toys as she called them stole a knife the first day I met her... lol it kinda gets worse as I remember every detail with different eyes", "NTA\n\nI would run away crying if someone called me 7 times in a day", "NTA. She sounds deeply insecure, codependent, and a total asshole for saying you\u2019re using her past trauma against her or whatever. That\u2019s some serious emotional manipulation. I saw your comment about her not going to therapy or taking her meds anymore, and could hazard a guess as to what the issues were just based off of this post. You communicated your boundaries several times- great start! As time goes on, work on really standing firm in those boundaries. This is very clingy, not-ok behavior. Sorry you\u2019re going through this rn\u2026 I guess the silver lining is it\u2019s a lesson learned. It\u2019s ok to stand up for yourself. You did nothing wrong.", "NAH. Sounds like you both have different expectations of a relationship and were not compatible long term. Just move on.", "YTA.", "Way to throw a bucket of cold water onto a relationship still in the honeymoon phase. It's not unusual to want to be in constant communication at the beginning of a relationship. YTA.", "Yes 5-7+ calls a day is unusual. It\u2019s even more unacceptable for him to have communicated this boundary SEVERAL times over and she stomped all over it and called him even MORE. You sound like you take boundaries personally and engage in the behavior she does- this is red flag behavior. Maybe some self reflection is in order for you.", "\"I feel like a toy being pressed until it breaks\"\n\nThat is a strong image. Well done. You conveyed exactly the feeling you intended.\n\nRegardless of her past traumas, if her behaviors don't work for you, it doesn't matter the reason for them.\n\nIt sounds like her 'plans' were designed to make you jealous. I'm betting she didn't expect you to break up over it.\n\nNTA\n\nIt simply wasn't working for you.", "Actually I barely call or text when I'm in a relationship. I'm what they call emotionally unavailable and avoidant attachment. However, other people tend get super lovey-dovey with their schmoopies early on and then panic when the fog clears because this person wants constant attention.", "Jesus Christ.. Run"]}
