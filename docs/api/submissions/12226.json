(After telling my dad to take off his mask \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a) Maybe if he had said it in a nicer tone it wouldn\u2019t have been so awful but the way he spoke made it sound like my father, who is the sweetest, kindest, one of the most gentlest souls I know, was complete trash. So the next morning, before going to see my Dad at the hospital, I drove the 45 minutes to the ER room he was at, filed a formal complaint and then made another special trip just to light him up. Maybe it was excessive but as an ER nurse you need to have compassion for your patients and if you don\u2019t then you shouldn\u2019t even fucking be there.", "NTA\n\nMy husband had melanoma surgery, and they took a couple of nodes to check (fine, thankfully). This meant he couldn't have sticks or BP in the arm where the nodes were taken. He passed out after a gig one night due to a change in meds, and we went to the ER, where a nurse insisted on taking his BP on the bad arm, left the arm cuff on, and blew me off when I complained. After the ER visit, I complained to the hospital that he played music for a living, and if he ended up with nerve impingement and edema from that careless nurse, a wing of the hospital would be named after him. I never saw that nurse again. Report the nurses that took your daughter's broken leg lightly and mishandled her. She could have ended up with permanent damage.\n\nI hope she has a quick, complete recovery!\n\nETA: Having a bad day doesn't entitle them to hurt your daughter, or any other patient. I don't blame you at all.", "What the actual hell? NTA! \nI as a full grown adult sure as heck made a lot of noise when I had to get my ankle set after breaking it, and again when I dislocated my knee. I was in that much pain, I was trying not to be loud but damn. Can\u2019t even imagine being a child with a broken Femur, which is one of the most painful bones to break! I would have lost my shit at the nurses.", "NTA i had a hamster that broke its leg trying to escape his home and while at the vet the vet was feeling his leg when hammy turned around and bit the hell out of him, of course we start apologizing and the vets response \"if someone pulled on my broken leg I'd probably try to attack them too\"\n\nThe nurse should be glad your daughter didn't physically retaliate because i definitely would and so would my 50 something year old vet", "NTA. Nurses are either the kindest most gentle people you will meet or the worst. Sorry you ran into the bad ones.", "nta. there are lots of nurses who are overworked and treated poorly but no matter what that\u2019s not an excuse to treat a patient like that. my mom broke her leg after falling down the stairs and i still remember the screams as the paramedics carried her upstairs and got her into the ambulance. it\u2019s no joke. those nurses had no right to speak to her that way and if that\u2019s how they treat patients with very obvious injuries I don\u2019t even want to think about the numerous patients they\u2019ve probably gaslit into thinking they\u2019re overreacting.", "NTA. Report them both !", "You\u2019re NTA. Some of the absolutely bitchiest people I\u2019ve ever met have been nurses. They have a hard job but that doesn\u2019t negate human decency", "NTA reported their stupid, uncaring, horrible-at-their-job asses. They do not deserve to be in a position to care for others. Hope your kid feels better.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't threaten her - you didn't offer to break her leg for her.", "NTA The majority of my family works in medicine and would be absolutely ashamed if they yelled at a patient for being in pain. You didn't threaten the nurse. You confronted the nurse for being inappropriate and unempathetic with a patient and failing at her job. Honestly, I would look into reporting her to the nursing board.  \n\n\nNot to mention, tell your husband having a bad day does excuse yelling at a patient who is in pain. Bedside manner is absolutely an important part of care.", "NTA, even if they had to move the leg there was absolutely no reason to yell at a little girl like that. Especially one that was in pain.", "I was on your side until you felt it necessary to go up and threaten her because you THINK you saw her laugh. YTA.", "NTA just wanted to tell you  did a wonderful job advocating for your daughter. People are human and maybe they were having a bad day but that's not your problem. They chose their profession and part of that is having empathy and bedside manner towards the patient. Call the hospital administrator and report both nurses.  If they mistreated your daughter then they've gotten away with rudeness, lack of bedside manner and  lack of empathy for far too long.", "INFO: When your daughters leg broke, was it a compound fracture where the bones slipped and overlapped? Because if so it\u2019s likely the nurses were trying to pull the leg back into place to reduce her pain and put the femur in a more ideal position. I know you\u2019re stressed, it\u2019s hard seeing your kid in pain, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if theres some cognitive distortion going on here.", "ESH. The nurses were absolutely horrible in the way they treated your young daughter. \n\nBut the next time you saw her was a different day, and she didn\u2019t start or say anything to you. What you said to her was also not appropriate, because two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. \n\nYou are absolutely in the right to be upset, but you didn\u2019t have to continue escalating it.", "INFO: did you already have x-rays confirming it was a full break or a fracture? Which one was it? Was it already cast or elevated? Did the nurses need to move it to perform their job? Are you as miserable of a helicopter parent as you sound?\n\nI think this is either 100% fake or you're making up or omitting parts to make yourself look better. Also, you sound like you have a bit of an issue with main character syndrome if any of this is true.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t just lose the higher ground, you lost the war. You behaved like a teen.", "YTA for this made up post.  Nurses don\u2019t just walk into a room and casually move a broken leg.  Everything about this post is so phony.", "NTA I would have done exactly the same.", "NTA. A hope is not a threat. They were being shitty nurses. You're a great mom for standing up for your kid.", "NTA\n\nYou actually under reacted report them to the hospital\n\nThey were beyond cruel to a child...a child..that's fucked", "The femur is the most painful bone to break. Bumping it by accident or needing to move it happens- but yeah. Shitty nurses. Done scream at a child in pain. And get them some damn pain meds. \n\nI\u2019m actually amazed there was no doc there with them- this is a critical injury that should be dealt with fast.", "when I was in the ED age 14 for meningitis a nurse took my blood and must have hit a nerve (literally) bc my entire arm went ice cold and hurt SO BAD. I yelled out and she screamed at me to stop being such a baby about needles. Wouldn't listen to my explanation.", "Yes, this. Report them. This has to be behaviour in breach of their professional code of conduct - at least it is here in Australia. This isn't safe and competent care when taking care of a vulnerable patient. OP is NTA.", "Correct. I have been bitten by a patient with dementia. I have been swung at by psych patients. I have walked into someone hallucinating who pulled out their flexi-seal and was swinging it around the room (aka: a tube that goes up the bum to collect poo in a bag). I have been head butted by a child coming out of anesthesia and given a bloody nose. You do not yell at patients. You do not cause more pain (unless absolutely necessary, of course). You do not laugh at their pain. And you will get reported by me and a good number of my coworkers if you do so. The patient or family should report them, too. These people are in the most vulnerable position they can be in, take care of them properly goddamnit.\n\nNTA", "So many awful people go into medicine. Doctors and nurses who just do not have empathy or basic bedside manner. I wish \"do no harm\" extended to the same expectations it does for therapists.", "Totally didn't happen.", "Nothing about this post is believable.  It\u2019s mind boggling that people believe this is real.", "I've been in the same situation several times with my family members. I don't get loud but I do get ugly, I let them know that there's an ambulance chaser around every corner. Its about respect and common courtesy.", "They also chose their job profession. They knew going into nursing there would be longer hours and likely went into nursing for the money. They are getting paid good money to care for a patient or at least fake empathy and a decent bedside manner.", "My exact experience too.  Either the most wonderful people on earth, or weird angry petty tyrants, emphasis on petty.  Or straight up dumb.  I knew a nurse who genuinely said someone would need to get an eyelash transplant from their eyebrow hair because their eyelashes would never grow back (after burning them off with a lighter set too high).", "Not all nurses are mean girls, but almost all the high school mean girls go into nursing.", "I wish more people would call out the bad ones. Some seem to take pleasure in people's pain, it's disgusting.", "I have had a lot of nurses in my life the past 2\u00bd years. I have homecare nurses too. I tried to get another nurse had major issues with one. I was told no, you have no choices. Well, I told scheduling that I'd get a new one because the next time she stepped foot on my property I'd have her removed. Then called my oncology nurse and told her what was going on and magically I had a new nurse that week.", "I had a radiographer flatten out my broken wrist, presumably to get a better image, I\u2019ve never forgotten that SOB", "I had someone try to move my broken ankle.  It didn\u2019t feel good.  I would\u2019ve lost my shit if they had told me to keep my mouth shut. And saying that to a kid?", "When I\u2019m training I had some one butchering an IV on me. When the teacher tried to show her how to do it, I dunno he wrenched the needle around. I swore loudly and he snapped there are no nerves in the vein- I replied there are plenty in the skin!!", "I had a nurse see my piercings and tattoos and decide that I must be a degenerate (I'm an accountant with a husband and two kids but whatevs). I have narrow veins and low BP, and I told her that the \"best looking\" vein once the tourniquet is on is the most prone to collapse. After absolutely shredding that vein completely and making a bloody mess, she made a comment about how this always happens with drug users (I barely drink, let alone touch hard drugs).
