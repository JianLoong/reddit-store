He was having a really challenging time- he wouldn\u2019t sleep, sit still, or he calmed by all the tricks we had up our sleeves. In addition to this he was teething. The guy in the seat in front of us kept getting his seat bumped by the kiddo and kept giving me the half turn + side eye. Eventually at about 5 hours he turn to me and asked me to control my kid. I replied, \u2018we\u2019re doing our best\u2019 he repeated that you \u2018need to control your kid\u2019, I kept trying to explain we\u2019re doing everything we can.\n\nI feeling snarky and exhausted, \u201cI will relay the message to our son\u201d \n\nThe guy started going off on me, probably picking up on my jest. I told him again that we\u2019re doing our best and that if had a problem we should call the flight attendant to sort his issue out. He refused to do this. And kept arguing with me for a bit.\n\n\n My non combative wife was  mortified and I was angry. So to maliciously comply with the gentlemen I held our kid still on my lap facing this gentleman\u2019s seat and my son then screamed for the remaining 90 minutes of the flight. I hoped that the gentleman preferred his fate of loud screams over a few bumps on his chair.\n\nAm I as asshole for weaponizing my toddlers screaming?", "created_utc": 1674414469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10irdu2/aita_for_letting_my_son_scream_on_a_plane_for/", "score": 327, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were trying to be an ah, congrats you succeeded.", "Wtf is wrong with you?", "I once flew from Atlanta to San Diego, and someone's baby screamed the entire flight.

I don't know about anyone else, but I assumed she was flying alone with the baby, because that was how it appeared. \n\nAbout 4+ hours into the flight, two men sitting together were conversing quietly when a man sitting a row over from the mom got up and pitched a fit.

Holy shit. \n\nI travel frequently. Sure, kids cry on flights. I\u2019m prepared and have noise cancelling headphones.

You ensured this person couldn\u2019t sit comfortably or nap for the duration of the flight. \n\nThen, when they finally bring it up - you decide to allow your child to scream for 90 minutes? \n\nYour wife should be embarrassed. You should too. You showed you\u2019d rather get petty revenge on someone then be a decent parent and soothe your child. You sure showed everyone else on that plane what a stand up father you are \ud83d\ude44 \n\nNext time, if your son can\u2019t sit comfortably on your lap - book a row with extended leg room. Or book an additional seat. It\u2019s really not hard to be a decent human being.", "So, OP weaponized his child and punished the entire plane for 90 minutes, while also emotionally and mentally tormenting your child. YTA. This is a long flight, and maybe the kid would have been better off, had OP and his wife bought a seat for him so he could maybe sleep or at least feel more comfortable in his carrier or car seat.

You handled all of this poorly. \n\nOk, just because you can bring your 1.5 year old as a lap child, doesn\u2019t mean you should.

Bring the car seat (even buy a light/cheap one used just for travel) and tell your child it\u2019s just like when they ride in the car. Your child will be faaaaar more likely to nap and stay calm this way. Third, it absolutely is your job to entertain, distract and calm your child. No, squeezing them for 90 minutes while they scream doesn\u2019t count.

The guy in the seat in front of us kept getting his seat bumped by the kiddo and kept giving me the half turn + side eye. Eventually at about 5 hours he turn to me and asked me to control my kid. I replied, \u2018we\u2019re doing our best\u2019 he repeated that you \u2018need to control your kid\u2019, I kept trying to explain we\u2019re doing everything we can.\n\nI feeling snarky and exhausted, \u201cI will relay the message to our son\u201d \n\nThe guy started going off on me, probably picking up on my jest. I told him again that we\u2019re doing our best and that if had a problem we should call the flight attendant to sort his issue out. He refused to do this. And kept arguing with me for a bit.\n\n\n My non combative wife was  mortified and I was angry. So to maliciously comply with the gentlemen I held our kid still on my lap facing this gentleman\u2019s seat and my son then screamed for the remaining 90 minutes of the flight.

Is it annoying? Yes. But I\u2019m not going to be an entitled ass by believing all these people should never travel unless they can do so without inconveniencing me.", "I\u2019m interested to know how taking a plane would change things.  Just the ears?", "The key use of the word \"or\" in that document! Yes, you can use certain car seats if you buy the extra seat but that doesn't negate the point that it's not unsafe for infants to be on their parents lap as the comment I replied to claimed. Not many people over this way do the car seat option", "Not true? \ud83e\udd23 Look it up and you'll see that it is true that under the age of 2, \"infants\" have to sit on someone's lap under CAA and EASA regulations. Why would the infant go flying if they're correctly fastened onto the parent's lap?", "You said \"buy a seat and strap your child in\", making it sound like they should just use the regular belt around a baby. Yes, a car seat for the plane is safer but that still wouldn't necessarily keep the child quiet. Just not in his lap.", "I can't find the numbers on that. I'm not disagreeing that a car seat is safer and yeah, it should be required, but how many infants are dying during turbulence per year?", "No one said car seat.", "It\u2019s absolutely normal. I can\u2019t tell you how many nights I stayed up trying to soothe a crying baby. Add to that it was probably ear pressure for the poor little thing.

You do not escalate and make everyone even more miserable.\n\nYou may have wanted him to calm down more than any of them (I know the feeling too well) but you are the parent.

But before kids, as long as I could tell the parent was trying I knew nothing else could be done. \n\nKids are allowed in society as they are a part of society. If someone is that upset about seeing kids in public spaces they need to be the ones to adjust.

I use this thought in public now and it helps.", ">So what do you do when none of that helps? I ask because I had to do a cross country flight that was about 6 hours in length with my 16 month old. And we did all the those things, my husband and I. And not a single thing worked. I think he settled for maybe an hour at the end.\n\nYou don't take your 16 month old on a cross country flight. Maybe you get a train instead, or if it's just a vacation you hold off on taking it until your kid can actually handle travel. You don't make the trip miserable for the rest of us just because you're a shitty parent.", "I think/hope people will be more empathetic if you\u2019re obviously trying things, you bought your infant a seat (I wish airlines would stop allowing lap infants as a money saving option), you were apologetic instead of snarky like OP, etc. But OP was just a bad parent and citizen. Also you usually don\u2019t fly with kids that young except when necessary and take all precautions to help them be comfortable and sleep when you do.", "Look - I\u2019ll be honest. It\u2019s not fun\n\nThat said - I look to you. If I see you making the effort, I will shut up. Because no, you cannot tell a kid to \u201cshut up\u201d.

I really do get it - and if I see you trying - I\u2019ll sort out my own solution somehow. \n\nI promise I\u2019ll even try to do it so I\u2019m not being embarrassing to you.

I like to think that I\u2019m an understanding person, but I was shocked how badly it hurt the last time a kid accidentally bumped my chair. Must be something special the airline builds in just to make us suffer more.", "As a parent who flew frequently babies and toddlers, I always had snacks, new toys, and bought a seat for them so they\u2019d have more space.

Comprehension is hard,  I understand.", "I have heard that (and also to try to give a bottle during take off and landing). I'm not super sure how we'll deal with timing the sleeping when it's going to be at least two flight segments.
