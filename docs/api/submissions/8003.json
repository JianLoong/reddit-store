He was having a really challenging time- he wouldn\u2019t sleep, sit still, or he calmed by all the tricks we had up our sleeves. In addition to this he was teething. The guy in the seat in front of us kept getting his seat bumped by the kiddo and kept giving me the half turn + side eye. Eventually at about 5 hours he turn to me and asked me to control my kid. I replied, \u2018we\u2019re doing our best\u2019 he repeated that you \u2018need to control your kid\u2019, I kept trying to explain we\u2019re doing everything we can.\n\nI feeling snarky and exhausted, \u201cI will relay the message to our son\u201d \n\nThe guy started going off on me, probably picking up on my jest. I told him again that we\u2019re doing our best and that if had a problem we should call the flight attendant to sort his issue out. He refused to do this. And kept arguing with me for a bit.\n\n\n My non combative wife was  mortified and I was angry. So to maliciously comply with the gentlemen I held our kid still on my lap facing this gentleman\u2019s seat and my son then screamed for the remaining 90 minutes of the flight. I hoped that the gentleman preferred his fate of loud screams over a few bumps on his chair.\n\nAm I as asshole for weaponizing my toddlers screaming?", "created_utc": 1674414469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10irdu2/aita_for_letting_my_son_scream_on_a_plane_for/", "score": 3608, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were trying to be an ah, congrats you succeeded.", "Wtf is wrong with you?", "I once flew from Atlanta to San Diego, and someone's baby screamed the entire flight.

I don't know about anyone else, but I assumed she was flying alone with the baby, because that was how it appeared. \n\nAbout 4+ hours into the flight, two men sitting together were conversing quietly when a man sitting a row over from the mom got up and pitched a fit. Apparently he was the father and because the two were speaking quietly, he assumed they were complaining about the baby. His baby.

Holy shit. \n\nI travel frequently. Sure, kids cry on flights. I\u2019m prepared and have noise cancelling headphones.

You ensured this person couldn\u2019t sit comfortably or nap for the duration of the flight. \n\nThen, when they finally bring it up - you decide to allow your child to scream for 90 minutes? \n\nYour wife should be embarrassed. You should too. You showed you\u2019d rather get petty revenge on someone then be a decent parent and soothe your child. You sure showed everyone else on that plane what a stand up father you are \ud83d\ude44 \n\nNext time, if your son can\u2019t sit comfortably on your lap - book a row with extended leg room. Or book an additional seat. It\u2019s really not hard to be a decent human being.", "So, OP weaponized his child and punished the entire plane for 90 minutes, while also emotionally and mentally tormenting your child. YTA. This is a long flight, and maybe the kid would have been better off, had OP and his wife bought a seat for him so he could maybe sleep or at least feel more comfortable in his carrier or car seat.

You handled all of this poorly. \n\nOk, just because you can bring your 1.5 year old as a lap child, doesn\u2019t mean you should.

Bring the car seat (even buy a light/cheap one used just for travel) and tell your child it\u2019s just like when they ride in the car. Your child will be faaaaar more likely to nap and stay calm this way. Third, it absolutely is your job to entertain, distract and calm your child. No, squeezing them for 90 minutes while they scream doesn\u2019t count.

The guy in the seat in front of us kept getting his seat bumped by the kiddo and kept giving me the half turn + side eye. Eventually at about 5 hours he turn to me and asked me to control my kid. I replied, \u2018we\u2019re doing our best\u2019 he repeated that you \u2018need to control your kid\u2019, I kept trying to explain we\u2019re doing everything we can.\n\nI feeling snarky and exhausted, \u201cI will relay the message to our son\u201d \n\nThe guy started going off on me, probably picking up on my jest. I told him again that we\u2019re doing our best and that if had a problem we should call the flight attendant to sort his issue out. He refused to do this. And kept arguing with me for a bit.\n\n\n My non combative wife was  mortified and I was angry. So to maliciously comply with the gentlemen I held our kid still on my lap facing this gentleman\u2019s seat and my son then screamed for the remaining 90 minutes of the flight.

If you have a long trip, you can break it up with layovers in airports with a play area.
