I maintain that the solution is to get a bigger bed that he actually fits in properly so that all of our problems are solved.

We just use a duvet now like in Europe, with a washable cover and a feather insert, and then just a bottom sheet. Making the bed takes 15 seconds. I point this out because there is not just one correct way to make a bed.\n\nIMO, *you* don\u2019t have to do things as an adult just because that\u2019s what your mother preferred. Your partner\u2019s preferences now are more important than your mother\u2019s. You might also benefit from a weighted blanket on your side of the bed to help reduce thrashing around and encourage deep sleep.\n\n*Your partner* should be in a king size or California king size bed so that he will be more comfortable, and also so that your movement disturbs him less.  I wonder if he\u2019s being stubborn on this just because he perceives you to be stubborn about the sheets.\n\nThe solution IMO would be to set a budget and choose a new mattress and new bedding that you both like.  For $1000 total you can get a really nice king size mattress at Costco and lovely linens from HomeGoods or IKEA.   (Bed Bath and Beyond is also going out of business so you might find some goodies there on clearance.) \n\nYou might offer to keep the floors swept in exchange for him doing the trash or something.  If you both show flexibility and a willingness to compromise instead of stubborn rigidity in this area, you should then be able to put that to use in other areas of your relationship.", "NAH. I'm 6ft 3 and your partner has a point whenever I sleep at my mother in laws (ex nurse) house with hospital corners it really is super uncomfortable.\n\nI appreciate you point of view and understand it butbif I had to sleep in a bed made like that every night it would slowly drive me crazy.\n\nThere has to be some compromise here for you both.", "YTA your main argument for doing so is due to aesthetics. Your partners is comfort. When it comes to sleep, comfort trumps aesthetic.", "Tucked in sheets are horrible if you're even average sized for a man, and sleep long. Your untucked angst might be emotionally painful, but his is physically painful, so he wins.

Leave his side of the sheets alone so he is comfortable. This is what we do in my house where one partner is considerably taller than the other. One of us wants the sheets tucked in like you, the other is REALLY tall and their feet get trapped. Tucking in only one side solves the problem.\n\nYou trying to control both sides of the bed just because you love making hospital corners even if it makes your partner uncomfortable is selfish. Go take out your folding obsession on the napkins and towels. :)", "YTA.  Unless you're sharing a twin, a larger bed is not going to fix the problem with the hospital corners, so his disinterest in budgeting for it is irrelevant. \n\nYou both have different needs in the bedroom and you're refusing to see his needs in favour of yours. I would recommend a weighted blanket to help with the legitimate problem you have with thrashing so that you can be covered and weighed down on your side. As for the \"neat\" look, you've just gotta get over the whole aesthetic aspect if you're gonna share the bed with him. Get two beds if the aesthetic is so important to you, but you're both using it, so you both have a say in how it should be.

Sure some nights your side might slowly come untucked, but honestly is that worth a lifetime of arguing over the sheets? \n\nHonestly, I personally think (I doubt there\u2019s actual statistics hahah) keeping sheets tucked in while you sleep is uncommon, but everyone should be able to sleep comfortably.", "NAH - could you two use two separate sheets? Meaning you tuck yourself in nice and tight and he lays on top of that sheet with his own sheet? Im inclined to agree more with your partner because I would feel trapped and uncomfortable under the sheet but you\u2019re allowed to have your preferences too.", "Whoo, boy, do I know this disagreement.

This is known as \u201ccompromise.\u201d\n\nNAH", "NAH, you just need this solution:\n\nI also make the bed using hospital corners.\n\nWhen my husband complained that the sheets were too tight, I invented \"the toe pleat\". Basically, after putting the sheet in place & smoothing it out, before you do any tucking, pick up the sheet by the edge that is along the edge of the mattress at the foot of the bed (just pinch the sheet with each hand at either side of the bed), lift it about six inches (so that the part of the sheet hanging down over the foot of the bed rises up those six inches). Move the sheet (still holding it the same way you picked it up) a few inches toward the head of the bed, then gently pull (actually, it's a fold more than a pull) the sheet back to the edge of the mattress at the foot of the bed.  (This sounds more complicated than it is.)\n\nThis forms a pleat which allows room for feet!  You can still do a modified hospital corner on each side, tucking in the extra material left by the pleat on the left and right sides of the foot of the bed.\n\nThis invention saved my marriage. (I'm not entirely joking.)\n\nGood luck!", "YTA. At first i thought you meant you\u2019re tucking the bedsheet that you lie on top of and was confused how that could possibly cause any issues. Now, I\u2019m not very tall but whenever a hotel tucks the sheets I sleep under like this, I *have* to untuck them.

Something has gotta have to give here.", "I just wanted to say that my (sleeping) life changed so much for the better when my wife and I realised it's perfectly okay to be different types of sleepers.\n\nGet a king size bed.\nGet different covers for each of you.\nDeal with the fact it looks a bit strange.\nEnjoy the fact you both get good sleep.\n\nSleep is extremely important and shouldn't be compromised.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think YTA.", "NAH- Can\u2019t he just untuck his corner once he\u2019s in bed?", "Yup.\n\nYou want it because\u2026 uh\u2026. Because you want it.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t because it is actually physically uncomfortable. (By the way. I agree with him. I travel a good bit for my job and first thing I do is rip the sheet out of the tight tuck hotels do to the bottom.)\n\nYTA\n\nPS - might depend on version, but\u2026..program your Roomba to not to the immediate area at the base of the bed. Problem solved!", "YTA. You can tuck your side and leave his untucked.

Even if you had a longer bed, it would likely be too tight for his feet to tuck the sheet like you do.

So, if one person is doing work and offering solutions, and the other person is complaining unproductively, then the second person is TA. That being said, try pursuing the bigger bed option again. That seems to be the ideal course of action even if you have to save up for a while", "YTA - to all the nurses and social care workers out there - hospital corners are an abomination - the person inside them has their feet bent down at an uncomfortable angle and it can cause real painful issues if the patient is less mobile or unable to either fight their way out of the sheet prison, or call/ask for help/explain the problem.  It actually shortens ligament if done repeatedly over time. I have literally had a non-verbal, immobile relative scream with the pain of finally having their feet freed after several hours of being trapped by a nurse who liked her hospital corners and nice tidy tight tucking in of sheets.", "NAH. You just have incompatible sleep needs. I'm short, but I get your partner's dislike of being tightly tucked in. When I was a little kid, my mother would come to tuck us in at night - and as soon as she was out of the room, I'd yank the sheets out of the sides of the bed, because I felt like I was trapped in a damn cocoon.\n\nNeither of you is wrong. You need what you need.\n\nHowever, he is leaning towards AHness in calling the purchase of a bigger bed a \"ludicrous expense\".\n\nNow, maybe a bigger bed wouldn't solve your problems. And maybe he's right when he says it might not be as comfortable as your current bed. Or maybe you just don't have the budget for it. Those are all reasonable arguments.\n\nBut an expense is never \"ludicrous\" when it is an attempt to resolve a serious incompatibility in an otherwise loving relationship.\n\nIf he won't consider switching to a bigger bed, I would strongly recommend buying a separate bed for you. In a separate room, if there isn't sufficient space in your current bedroom. There is nothing wrong with partners sleeping in separate beds or even separate rooms when their sleep needs are so very different (hours, noise tolerance, darkness, thrashing, warmth, size of bed, type of bed covers, and many more).

For example;\n\nMake the bed however you please. He untucks at night to suit his fancy. You re-tuck in the morning when you make the bed to suit your fancy and please the Roomba.

It HURTS to have the sheets tucked in. Like, really actually is painful, causes poor sleep, and pain the next day.\n\nIs there a reason you cant untuck at night and re-tuck in the morning? At least for his side? Presumably you arent running the roomba while youre sleeping, so that seems like an easy enough solution. And who cares what the bed looks like while youre in it? Are you planning to give nighttime house tours or something? Lol\n\nAs far as a bigger bed goes, I'm also tall at 5'11. I actually prefer to sleep with my feet hanging off the edge sometimes. Its partly because the weight of blankets can hurt my feet even without being tucked, and partly due to nerve pain from an injury (When my nerve pain is bad touching anything sets it off and prevents me sleeping, so hanging off the edge it is. Monsters be damned!), but it could be he actually doesn't mind/likes the too short bed.", "INFO: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m confused. Why can\u2019t your partner just pull out the sheets at the foot of the bed before he gets in and goes to sleep? Win-win.", "The duvet + bottom sheet method, with no top sheet, was a game changer for me. I hate tightly-tucked sheet corners and loose sheets on my feet, and it's the perfect solution.", "A lot of people are missing the part about the roomba. It\u2019s not just aesthetics, when the sheets hang the roomba gets stuck. And the reason they have a roomba is because the boyfriend \u201crefuses to sweep\u201d. So it\u2019s more complicated. NTA because it sounds like his boyfriend could pull out his part of the sheet before sleeping, then tuck it away in the morning so the roomba can roam. If the reason for the roomba is because he won\u2019t sweep, then he should be responsible for making sure it doesn\u2019t get stuck.\n\nAnyways I\u2019m all for just getting a bigger bed. My boyfriend is also 6\u20195 and all angles, and it\u2019s a million times better sleeping once we got a king. He can take up a whole 2/3 of the bed and I don\u2019t even care cause I\u2019m in a different zip code over on my side lol.", "Hey, you get it! \ud83d\ude42", "Poor tall men! Mines just given up especially since he's too warm all the time. We were just watching Reacher last night and the quote that hit home was \"Tall guys never have any room for their feet\" \ud83e\udd23", "That\u2019s cool.  Everyone has their own preferences, which is kind of the point of the thread.  OP should consider that there isn\u2019t just one \u201cright\u201d way to go about this.", "It's actually really easy to pull a duvet cover off and put it back on, provided you have two people. Look up the burrito method, lol.", "Crazy you got downvotes.\n\n5 year old: bottom sheet with easy to wash duvet. \n\n14 year old: bottom sheet with easy to wash quilt, he sleeps on top of both in a nest of blankets\n\nHusband and me: bottom and top sheet with quilt. My husband doesn't like the top sheet, but I make the bed and do the washing.\n\nA double sounds way too small for two grown adults. I pay the extra at hotels for a king because I need space. That space gives us the ability to sleep as we prefer.", "I can fold a fitted sheet easy as can be but duvet covers and me just do not get along. Got one for the twin bed in the guest room that rarley get used so only really have to wash it if company is actually coming to stay and it sits on top of the insert cause I just can't. I tried my hardest 2 weeks ago and I got it in but could not get it straight, looked like a toddler did it.", "Yes it is. I must have bought the wrong kind of insert or something because I don't recall them having ties or anything. I'll have to look into that if I ever figure out where my duvets went...", "Sounds like it\u2019s too big, or the comforter has lost its *poof*", "Other people have mentioned that there are usually ties to connect the two parts. I don't remember ever seeing them on mine, but I probably missed it. I also might have used a regular quilt that's not meant to go inside something else. As far as I know, it was just a normal IKEA set, nothing fancy. If I ever find it, I'll take a second look.", "I'll look into this, thank you!", "The insert doesn't have ties, the duvet cover does, you just grab the corners of the insert and tie the duvet into it.", "Right. That was poorly worded on my part. Thanks for the instructions!", "YTA just stop tucking the sheets. Why do you need to buy a new bed just so you don't have to adjust your habit.", "NTA. It\u2019s nice to have a tidy bed. If he can\u2019t be bothered to pull a sheet, how does he even get in the bed???", "I\u2019m not understanding why he doesn\u2019t just kick the sheets free/untuck them before getting in?", "My side is tucked in, my husband\u2019s isn\u2019t.  If I tuck in his side then he untucks it. \n\nYou make the bed, so make it the way you want.  Your husband should untuck his side when he gets into bed.  How he\u2019s blaming his uncomfortable sheets on you is weird.  It takes seconds.", "ESH.   I don\u2019t make beds at all- life is too short.  I don\u2019t use a top sheet and having one tucked in at the bottom would drive me crazy.  Can\u2019t you just use a duvet cover?", "Couldn\u2019t he just pull his side of the sheets out at night and leave yours made?", "YTA for that title alone, making me believe that there could be no way in hell that you'd be the asshole in a situation that's as simple as you making the bed, but here we are ya asshole haha", "Get two sheets! Tuck one in on your side and one open on his side! My husband and I do that a lot, mostly because I am a sleep demon and alternate between cocoon and barely covered. NTA\n\nETA you may have to accept that you\u2019ll have to just tuck his sheet overhang under the duvet before the Roomba runs. Somethings aren\u2019t worth the mental load of fighting or even compromise. I know I probably have tons of annoying things my husband doesn\u2019t nitpick and I choose a few of his to overlook. I do understand that isn\u2019t always easy or possible if there are other, bigger issues stuck under the covers like the Roomba", "YTA my husband is over 6ft and I'm fastidious about making the bed every morning... However. He hates it tucked in....I'm 5'3 and feel better when it's tucked. Easy. I tuck my half and leave his untucked. Pull down the duvet so that it covers any overhang. Boom. Nicely made bed. No complaints. Compromise.", "YTA you are old enough not to blame your mother for the choices you make today in a house she doesn\u2019t live in. Time to start letting go of this hang up. Your partner should come before the ghost of you childhood.", "Do a Google search and maybe find a company that makes longer and bigger beds specifically for taller people", "Turn the duvet cover inside out.  Lay the insert on top of it.  Grab corners of insert to corners of duvet along the closed end. Start turning it all right side in.", "This is literally so dumb. Neither of you are compromising, tho tbh, your partner less so. I hate tucked sheets personally, but if he's refusing to get a bigger bed OR sweep, yeah nah, that's on him", "NAH - he just needs 5o pull his side out.  My side is tucked, husband's is untucked.   It isn't just uncomfortable for him but putting pressure on your foot like that could cause plantar fasciitis!", "NAH. I have the same situation. DH likes a completely loose bed and I like a snug one. I hospital corner my side and leave his loose. For Roomba I slightly tuck his end so nothing gets caught during the routine", "Oh, Puhleese! I think you both are a mess (him a bit more of an ahole than you, but neither one of you shine).\n\n1. I'm 5'5\" and my husband is 6'7\". We both grew up with partial hospital corners on our beds (we create the corner but don't tuck all of the sheet in along the side. We still tuck in the bottom and make the corner. Only, now my husband then tugs out some of the BOTTOM of the sheet (doesn't completely untuck it, just pulls out some excess cloth). That gives him the extra room for his feet and still keeps the bedsheet nicely in place. The bedcover hides the excess cloth, loose at the bottom of the bed. Your approach didn't give him the space where he needed it.\n2. We got a California bed. Your partner is the one who's got the length issue. He should consider it an investment in a perfectly reasonable long-term solution. It might be great timing when you settle into your new home next month. It sounds like it's not an actual lack of funds but his choice not to prioritize spending a cent to help him sleep comfortably. (If it would be a true financial stretch, there are still good options that don't cost more.)\n3. Another option would be for you to tuck in your side of the bed and the bottom to about half-way. Then the partner's end can be loose. (Not perfect, but you each get your half the way you like it, without spending more money)\n4. Neither one of you seem to be very broadminded in problem-solving here.  But you are at least trying. Partner doesn't seem to want any solution other than not tucking in the sheets at all.", "ESH for you both agreeing to sleep in a full size bed.", "I have found my people.", "\u201cOne tuck, one no tuck.\u201d\u2014George Costanza"]}
