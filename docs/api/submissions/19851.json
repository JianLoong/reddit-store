It's just how a bed is supposed to be made and looks way neater than having sheets draping all over the place. Allegedly, I also thrash around while I sleep and having a nice secure sheet would help keep the blankets in place while I'm tossing and turning.\n\nThe problem is that my partner is 6'5\" and his feet reach the end of our double bed. Apparently, the sheets are too tight for his feet with the hospital corners and he complains about not being able to flex them up to the ceiling when lying on his back.\n\nWe also have a Roomba because he refuses to sweep the floors; and the hanging sheets cause it to get stuck under the bed. I maintain that the solution is to get a bigger bed that he actually fits in properly so that all of our problems are solved. He thinks this is a ludicrous expense and refuses to even consider budgetting for it despite the fact he makes twice as much money as I do. He also loves saying that our current bed is the most comfortable bed that he's ever slept on and doesn't want to change it.\n\nWe changed our sheets before doing laundry tonight and I even went out of my way to only tuck the bottom of the sheet and not the sides. But apparently this is still a hospital corner and I am being inconsiderate to his \"needs.\" Our relationship is fine otherwise but I can't keep having this argument.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole every time I make our bed?", "created_utc": 1686953131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14b9a1z/aita_for_making_the_bed/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s more than 2 options", "ESH.  My husband is also tall (6\u20192\u201d) and he also despises having the sheets tucked in.  We just use a duvet now like in Europe, with a washable cover and a feather insert, and then just a bottom sheet. Making the bed takes 15 seconds. I point this out because there is not just one correct way to make a bed.\n\nIMO, *you* don\u2019t have to do things as an adult just because that\u2019s what your mother preferred. Your partner\u2019s preferences now are more important than your mother\u2019s. You might also benefit from a weighted blanket on your side of the bed to help reduce thrashing around and encourage deep sleep.\n\n*Your partner* should be in a king size or California king size bed so that he will be more comfortable, and also so that your movement disturbs him less.  I wonder if he\u2019s being stubborn on this just because he perceives you to be stubborn about the sheets.\n\nThe solution IMO would be to set a budget and choose a new mattress and new bedding that you both like.  For $1000 total you can get a really nice king size mattress at Costco and lovely linens from HomeGoods or IKEA.   (Bed Bath and Beyond is also going out of business so you might find some goodies there on clearance.) \n\nYou might offer to keep the floors swept in exchange for him doing the trash or something.  If you both show flexibility and a willingness to compromise instead of stubborn rigidity in this area, you should then be able to put that to use in other areas of your relationship.", "NAH. I'm 6ft 3 and your partner has a point whenever I sleep at my mother in laws (ex nurse) house with hospital corners it really is super uncomfortable.\n\nI appreciate you point of view and understand it butbif I had to sleep in a bed made like that every night it would slowly drive me crazy.\n\nThere has to be some compromise here for you both.", "YTA your main argument for doing so is due to aesthetics. Your partners is comfort. When it comes to sleep, comfort trumps aesthetic.", "Tucked in sheets are horrible if you're even average sized for a man, and sleep long. Your untucked angst might be emotionally painful, but his is physically painful, so he wins. YTA.\n\nPossible compromises might involve you making the bed with hospital corners and him pulling them loose every evening before bed.", "YTA\n\nTuck in YOUR side of the sheets with hospital corners. Leave his side of the sheets alone so he is comfortable. This is what we do in my house where one partner is considerably taller than the other. One of us wants the sheets tucked in like you, the other is REALLY tall and their feet get trapped. Tucking in only one side solves the problem.\n\nYou trying to control both sides of the bed just because you love making hospital corners even if it makes your partner uncomfortable is selfish. Go take out your folding obsession on the napkins and towels. :)", "YTA.  Unless you're sharing a twin, a larger bed is not going to fix the problem with the hospital corners, so his disinterest in budgeting for it is irrelevant. \n\nYou both have different needs in the bedroom and you're refusing to see his needs in favour of yours. I would recommend a weighted blanket to help with the legitimate problem you have with thrashing so that you can be covered and weighed down on your side. As for the \"neat\" look, you've just gotta get over the whole aesthetic aspect if you're gonna share the bed with him. Get two beds if the aesthetic is so important to you, but you're both using it, so you both have a say in how it should be. You need to compromise because what you're asking is directly impacting his sleep and, sorry, you CANNOT negatively impact your partner's sleep", "YTA - but not a huge one, and not on purpose, it\u2019s what you\u2019re used to. \n\nI\u2019m a short woman and I cannot stand the feeling of tucked in sheets against my legs/feet, it\u2019s very claustrophobic and I just feel trapped lol.\n\nI think the solution is simple - continue making the bed as you do, but let him untuck not only the side, but also the bottom on his side when it\u2019s time to lay down for bed. Sure some nights your side might slowly come untucked, but honestly is that worth a lifetime of arguing over the sheets? \n\nHonestly, I personally think (I doubt there\u2019s actual statistics hahah) keeping sheets tucked in while you sleep is uncommon, but everyone should be able to sleep comfortably.", "NAH - could you two use two separate sheets? Meaning you tuck yourself in nice and tight and he lays on top of that sheet with his own sheet? Im inclined to agree more with your partner because I would feel trapped and uncomfortable under the sheet but you\u2019re allowed to have your preferences too.", "Whoo, boy, do I know this disagreement. Easy solution, though - don\u2019t tuck his side in. This is known as \u201ccompromise.\u201d\n\nNAH", "NAH, you just need this solution:\n\nI also make the bed using hospital corners.\n\nWhen my husband complained that the sheets were too tight, I invented \"the toe pleat\". Basically, after putting the sheet in place & smoothing it out, before you do any tucking, pick up the sheet by the edge that is along the edge of the mattress at the foot of the bed (just pinch the sheet with each hand at either side of the bed), lift it about six inches (so that the part of the sheet hanging down over the foot of the bed rises up those six inches). Move the sheet (still holding it the same way you picked it up) a few inches toward the head of the bed, then gently pull (actually, it's a fold more than a pull) the sheet back to the edge of the mattress at the foot of the bed.  (This sounds more complicated than it is.)\n\nThis forms a pleat which allows room for feet!  You can still do a modified hospital corner on each side, tucking in the extra material left by the pleat on the left and right sides of the foot of the bed.\n\nThis invention saved my marriage. (I'm not entirely joking.)\n\nGood luck!", "YTA. At first i thought you meant you\u2019re tucking the bedsheet that you lie on top of and was confused how that could possibly cause any issues. Now, I\u2019m not very tall but whenever a hotel tucks the sheets I sleep under like this, I *have* to untuck them. I find it super uncomfortable, and I can only imagine how much more uncomfortable it would be if my legs didn\u2019t quite fit on the bed. Something has gotta have to give here.", "I just wanted to say that my (sleeping) life changed so much for the better when my wife and I realised it's perfectly okay to be different types of sleepers.\n\nGet a king size bed.\nGet different covers for each of you.\nDeal with the fact it looks a bit strange.\nEnjoy the fact you both get good sleep.\n\nSleep is extremely important and shouldn't be compromised.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think YTA.", "NAH- Can\u2019t he just untuck his corner once he\u2019s in bed?", "Yup.\n\nYou want it because\u2026 uh\u2026. Because you want it.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t because it is actually physically uncomfortable. (By the way. I agree with him. I travel a good bit for my job and first thing I do is rip the sheet out of the tight tuck hotels do to the bottom.)\n\nYTA\n\nPS - might depend on version, but\u2026..program your Roomba to not to the immediate area at the base of the bed. Problem solved!", "YTA. You can tuck your side and leave his untucked. You don\u2019t particularly care if your partner is comfortable when they sleep because \u201cit\u2019s just how a bed is supposed to be made\u201d. You can\u2019t keep having this argument? Then stop tucking in the sheets on his side and there won\u2019t be an argument. Oh and \u201cAllegedly\u201d you thrash around? That sounds like you\u2019ve been told you thrash but you simply don\u2019t believe it. You sound like a peach to live with\u2026.as long as everything is done your way.", "YTA\n\nYou know that he can't fit in the bed. Even if you had a longer bed, it would likely be too tight for his feet to tuck the sheet like you do. And if your Roomba can't work around it, then you need to figure out a way to have the sheet not hang on the floor (my husband has the same issue and the sheet doesn't drag on the floor on his side, even though it isn't tucked).", "NTA. If your partner can afford a Roomba in your budget because he doesn\u2019t want to vacuum then I don\u2019t see how a larger bed can\u2019t fit into the budget either. Plus a larger bed would last longer compared to the Roomba.", "NAH - Everyone has their preferences. You need to talk with your partner and find a compromise.", "You need a bigger bed. Failing *that*, a *second* bed.  NTA", "NTA. But needs compromise. A bigger bed would be a good start, but even then the tight sheet may still bother him. But I understand why you like it how you do. \nFWIW when I was studying nursing they showed us how to add a tidy pleat in the sheet at the foot of the bed, so that the patient\u2019s feet would be comfortable despite the precision corner tucking!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If that doesn\u2019t work then he can make the bed.\nNTA.", "NTA. Making the bed is a chore. People don't get to gripe about someone else doing chores unless they are offering to do it themselves. On top of that, you are being solution oriented by talking about getting a bigger bed and not tucking the sides. Literally all he has to do is untuck the sheet on his side. It takes 1 second. So, if one person is doing work and offering solutions, and the other person is complaining unproductively, then the second person is TA. That being said, try pursuing the bigger bed option again. That seems to be the ideal course of action even if you have to save up for a while", "YTA - to all the nurses and social care workers out there - hospital corners are an abomination - the person inside them has their feet bent down at an uncomfortable angle and it can cause real painful issues if the patient is less mobile or unable to either fight their way out of the sheet prison, or call/ask for help/explain the problem.  It actually shortens ligament if done repeatedly over time. I have literally had a non-verbal, immobile relative scream with the pain of finally having their feet freed after several hours of being trapped by a nurse who liked her hospital corners and nice tidy tight tucking in of sheets.", "NAH. You just have incompatible sleep needs. I'm short, but I get your partner's dislike of being tightly tucked in. When I was a little kid, my mother would come to tuck us in at night - and as soon as she was out of the room, I'd yank the sheets out of the sides of the bed, because I felt like I was trapped in a damn cocoon.\n\nNeither of you is wrong. You need what you need.\n\nHowever, he is leaning towards AHness in calling the purchase of a bigger bed a \"ludicrous expense\".\n\nNow, maybe a bigger bed wouldn't solve your problems. And maybe he's right when he says it might not be as comfortable as your current bed. Or maybe you just don't have the budget for it. Those are all reasonable arguments.\n\nBut an expense is never \"ludicrous\" when it is an attempt to resolve a serious incompatibility in an otherwise loving relationship.\n\nIf he won't consider switching to a bigger bed, I would strongly recommend buying a separate bed for you. In a separate room, if there isn't sufficient space in your current bedroom. There is nothing wrong with partners sleeping in separate beds or even separate rooms when their sleep needs are so very different (hours, noise tolerance, darkness, thrashing, warmth, size of bed, type of bed covers, and many more). There's no reason why two people need to sleep in the same bed every night just because they're in a sexual relationship.", "INFO: is there any way to tuck in just your side of the bed? I know it probably sounds silly, but his needs do need to be considered. I don\u2019t think YTA, simply because you both have needs not being met, and all nerds should be considered. The bigger bed is a great compromise!", "How old is your current mattress? Other than that I would say keep making the bed the way you have been since it is more aesthetically pleasing and before he gets into bed he can just un tuck his corner do his feet stick out. But if your mattress is older I would buy a bigger bed I\u2019m sure you can find the same mattress in a size up.", "NAH. Everyone has a particular preference for how they sleep. Two sheets (or no accursed top sheet at all!) is the way to go. Though you will eventually have to consider buying a new bed when this one wears out.", "Both of you want to be right and it's very silly. ESH\n\nA win win compromise is just to tuck the sides of the sheet: Roomba can escape, your partner has space for his feet, and you have nice secure sheet.", "ESH/NAH - really depends on if you are a glass half full person or not  - there are many easy solutions either of you could make to fix this situation. For example;\n\nMake the bed however you please. He untucks at night to suit his fancy. You re-tuck in the morning when you make the bed to suit your fancy and please the Roomba. This sequence of events could happen in multiple ways with varying who is tucking and untucking.  \n\nContinuing to have constant mini battles is mundane and will erode the \"magic\" protect you relationship like the ring from that movie with the creepy little guy (ADHD brain is not coming through for me).", "YTA. It's not that hard for both of you to be happy. What has been tucked can be untucked. Make the bed super-neat in the morning, just as you're now doing.
