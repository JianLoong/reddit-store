My (29M) twin sister (29F) and her boyfriend (34M) are expecting their first child together in early June. This will be my sister's firstborn, but her boyfriend already has two children of his own (8F and 14M). The mother of his teenage son doesn't allow him to see his own son, and the mother of his 8-year-old daughter dumps their daughter on him every weekend so she can go out partying and drinking with her friends.\n\nMy sister is not on maternity leave as of yet, but once she gives birth to her baby, she will be expected to go back a few months after she has given birth. She didn't straight up tell me this, but she has insinuated that she expects me and my parents (67F and 71M) to babysit her child every day when she goes back to work. She works as a dental nurse, and she goes to work every day except for Sundays. I have multiple disabilities. One of my disabilities is called slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). One of the symptoms of this condition is that I sometimes get excruciating pains in the femur joint in my left leg. This can make walking for me very painful, especially in the mornings after I get out of bed.\n\nOn top of this, my mum has also experienced really bad chronic pains ever since she had treatment for oropharyngeal cancer just over a decade ago. The treatment has left to a series of complications that required her to have a shoulder replacement in her left shoulder. Because of this, she cannot raise her arm up very much and she can't lift up heavy things, either. My dad, while a bit fit for his age, has the absolute WORST temperament. He literally gets angry over the most miniscule of things. I wouldn't want his future granddaughter or grandson to be around that.\n\nMy sister's boyfriend isn't particularly close with either of his parents, especially his dad. He also has a younger sister (28F) that used to be in the same class as my sister as primary school. However, she already has two children of her own and I don't think he would want to burden her with her future niece or nephew.\n\nI would really like to spend a little bit of time with my future niece or nephew, but I don't think I'd be able to look after it for 6 out of 7 days of the week. I just know if I declined, everyone would guilt trip me into doing so. They actually do this to me quite a lot - especially my mother. I just know they would say things to me like \"stop being so selfish\" or \"family is supposed to help each other\".\n\nWIBTA if I refused to look after my sister's baby when she finishes maternity leave?\n\n**Edit:** My apologies.
