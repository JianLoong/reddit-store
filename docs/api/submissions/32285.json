My (29M) twin sister (29F) and her boyfriend (34M) are expecting their first child together in early June. This will be my sister's firstborn, but her boyfriend already has two children of his own (8F and 14M). The mother of his teenage son doesn't allow him to see his own son, and the mother of his 8-year-old daughter dumps their daughter on him every weekend so she can go out partying and drinking with her friends.\n\nMy sister is not on maternity leave as of yet, but once she gives birth to her baby, she will be expected to go back a few months after she has given birth. She didn't straight up tell me this, but she has insinuated that she expects me and my parents (67F and 71M) to babysit her child every day when she goes back to work. She works as a dental nurse, and she goes to work every day except for Sundays. I have multiple disabilities. One of my disabilities is called slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). One of the symptoms of this condition is that I sometimes get excruciating pains in the femur joint in my left leg. This can make walking for me very painful, especially in the mornings after I get out of bed.\n\nOn top of this, my mum has also experienced really bad chronic pains ever since she had treatment for oropharyngeal cancer just over a decade ago. The treatment has left to a series of complications that required her to have a shoulder replacement in her left shoulder. Because of this, she cannot raise her arm up very much and she can't lift up heavy things, either. My dad, while a bit fit for his age, has the absolute WORST temperament. He literally gets angry over the most miniscule of things. I wouldn't want his future granddaughter or grandson to be around that.\n\nMy sister's boyfriend isn't particularly close with either of his parents, especially his dad. He also has a younger sister (28F) that used to be in the same class as my sister as primary school. However, she already has two children of her own and I don't think he would want to burden her with her future niece or nephew.\n\nI would really like to spend a little bit of time with my future niece or nephew, but I don't think I'd be able to look after it for 6 out of 7 days of the week. I just know if I declined, everyone would guilt trip me into doing so. They actually do this to me quite a lot - especially my mother. I just know they would say things to me like \"stop being so selfish\" or \"family is supposed to help each other\".\n\nWIBTA if I refused to look after my sister's baby when she finishes maternity leave?\n\n**Edit:** My apologies. I meant she goes to work every day except for Sundays.", "created_utc": 1701635672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18a2lku/wibta_if_i_refused_to_look_after_my_sisters_baby/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t offer to be an emergency back up or anything like that, otherwise she will take that as a green light to you caring for her baby. Do it now, so that she processes the No and gets something lined up immediately.", "NTA. You don't not have a job Just Because, you don't have a Job because you are too physically disabled to Work, and your mother does not have a Job because she's old AND physically disabled AND busy managing an unpredictably volatile Elder, Nannying is a demanding Job that both of you are neither willing to do nor ABLE to ADEQUATELY do, so you shouldn't be expected to. Your sister needs to Figure out her childcare herself, and If that involves her or Boyfriend or both changing their Work hours to a very unpleasant/unfortunate arrangement, then they may have to because it's THEIR Baby.", "NTA. Not your baby or your problem. That's HER problem.", "Why does your sister work 6 days a week ( I'm a dental nurse too). If she works like I do, start at 8am and finishes anytime thanks to emergencies that's quiet unfair to expect t\n you or your parents to mind her child for very long hours 6 days a week. She needs to get proper childcare or/ and cut back her days and possibly her hours.", "NTA.  Honestly, if I were your sister I wouldn't let you or your parents watch my baby solo. Your disability affects your mobility, same with your mom, this could potentially be dangerous when carrying the baby, or even just getting to the baby, your mom can't even safely lift the baby. \n\nYour parents are also at an age where heart attacks and strokes  have a higher probability of happening. Your mom isn't in the best of health already and if your dad's temper is that bad I question what his blood pressure is like.\n\nYou are being a responsible adult and looking at your health a potential hazard to the care of an infant. That is not being an A H that is actually giving a crap. Your sister on the other hand is an ah for considering financial benefits over safety and being with the guy she is.", "NTA. Your sister is extremely inconsiderate expecting you and your parents to take care of the baby. Do not let your mother and sister guilt- trip you into babysitting. Be firm and set boundaries. No is an entire sentence.", "NTA - be clear that you won\u2019t be able to help due to your disabilities. That would not only be unfair to your/your health but would also be unfair to the baby and could put it in harms way. I think if you say it\u2019s not in yours and the baby\u2019s best interest that they might see the bigger picture. \n\nProtecting your health is not selfish. In fact it is selfish of them to jeopardize your health instead of finding an alternative solution. You are being proactive by letting her know as soon as possible so she can make alternative arrangements.", "NTA\n\nStop caring what people will think. The kind of people who would manipulate you into providing care that you physically can't do for an *infant* are despicable people.\n\nTell your sister that you will never babysit the child, ever. That your body isn't up to it and you will not put yourself or the child through it. Lean heavily on not being physically able to. Anyone who argues with that is pushing for the child to be unsafe, and that's bad parenting. You can have a great uncle relationship with a child without being left alone with them.\n\nYour parents can do whatever they want, but *you* will not be involved. It's her kid, her responsibility. She can either stay home or pay for childcare. You're not an option, end of story.", "Nta but tell her this and stay firm with this. I think you have already given her a lot of slack to even assume this. If she is having a baby, the first things she should figure out are child care, day care costs, pre school costs and set up a college fund. All of this before the baby arrives. Because after it does she will not get anymore time.", "For the baby\u2019s safety, neither you nor your mother sound like ideal caregivers. It would seem that perhaps your sister is assuming you guys will handle babysitting, but it needs to be brought up that you and your parents are not in a position to do so and for the baby\u2019s sake, childcare will need to be found elsewhere. NTA.", "Nope NTA\n\nYour sister needs to find a daycare or a Willing relative to dump her kid on. Tell her No and keep repeating it. If she drops the kid off after you said no, let her know you will be calling the cops for child abandonment. \n\nZero tolerance for people who try to push the responsibly of their children on other people.", ". . . or it's entirely possible that the mother doesn't want him in his son's life because he's a crappy person who speaks badly of his children's mothers (e.g. referring to taking care of his own 8-year-old daughter on the weekends as having her \"dumped on him\" and deriding her mother for actually enjoying her free time when she bears most of the burden and responsibility of parenting), and is very happy for him not to be directly involved with the boy if that's the kind of influence he'd be. \n\nEither way, OP's sister's boyfriend sounds like a real winner, and exactly who one would want as their child's dad. /s\n\nBut yeah, as someone who is also disabled, OP is absolutely NTA, but needs to make clear NOW, well ahead of time, that he will not be able to and is not interested in, being their primary source of childcare when the sister goes back to work, so that they have plenty of time to seek an alternative. He should also probably point out to them that the grandparents aren't really an appropriate option, and that they should probably be looking at and applying for subsidized daycare spaces NOW, because you often have to do that even before the baby is born if there are waitlists.", "Yes, this.", "Why did sister even think having a child with this guy was a good idea.  And she's just as bad. Has no problem working 6 days a week while someone else spends all their waking hours all day taking care of her child.

This poor woman is parenting her child all week, and tries to allow the child to see her dad on the weekends, and everyone says she\u2019s \u201cdumping\u201d the child on him? No. This guy is a deadbeat.", "You\u2019re absolutely right-it could be either way. Regardless, OP\u2019s sister did not choose a good person to reproduce with since he is clearly a crappy dad to both of his kids.\n\nOP absolutely needs to be clear and firm with her, and soon!", "This is an excellent suggestion!!"]}
