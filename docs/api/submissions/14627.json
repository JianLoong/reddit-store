Set the boundaries in plain text \" apologize to me in front of my kids, and don't let it happen again\" and then make a decision. \n\nI have toxic, narcissistic and neglectful parents and I can assure you it SUCKS. But it's best to try and somewhat salvage a minimal contact relationship before going 100% no contact. IF the boundaries are set and respected, minimize the future interactions to being short and sweet, for example I never stay at their houses overnight, never spend more than a few days visiting, and would never get locked into the same car ride together that will be longer than 10 minutes. \n\nPeople like this often can pretend to play nice for \"families sake\" in short durations, and for the kids sake see if it's possible, but if not, then you can go no contact.", "So I honestly dont think he has.

OP's dad yelling in front of the kids and traumatizing them makes me wonder if he's capable of pretending to play nice. Also, OP's mom not intervening bothers me.\n\nIf I swapped OP's parents with my own toxic parents and my parents yelled at me like this in front of my six year old, it'd be zero contact with them.

For your safety and your kids' safety. \n\nTbh, if your mom wants to see her grandkids, I'd let her. She is okay with the behavior cause she's scared to stand up and leave. Meet her somewhere public or have her come to your house alone so she can see you kids.", "Your not wrong. Considering the kids, 100% should it never be tolerated again, and I wouldn't blame anyone for deciding on skipping the 2nd chances. That's definitely optional", "That's the other thing. She doesn't drive. She's in her 50's and has never had a driver's license. I don't know the exact reason. I never felt the need to ask.", "How long have your parents been together? If they were teens together, your dad may have forced her not to drive. He seems to be abusive. It may have been a power move to have control. \n\nThis, of course, is a stretch but doesn't seem impossible. Another reason may be that she never had the time or ability to do so.", "24 years. I do now she was pretty sheltered by my grandparents. But everyone else in my family drives, so it doesn't make sense. I do know they were against me getting my license, but I did it once I turned 18.", "24 years, and your 29? I'm sorry if it's personal, but the math doesn't add. \n\nAlso, we're they BOTH against you driving, or was your mom following your dad's lead?", "She's my stepmom.

Thing is she didn't want to apologise and make amends and be a better mother to me, she just wanted to have access to the kids. She made a number of digs at my daughter, not often, just a handful of times, but it still effects her at age 30. My son was the 'golden child'.  Both kids refused any contact with her once they reached their teens. Just her attitude, her demeaner was enough to make them hate her, even though she was on the whole trying to be a loving Grandma, albeit a very nasty mother. \n\nSo anyone on here who says give them a second chance is wrong. One aggressive outburst is once too many. If you have been effected by him, so will your kids, there is no doubt about that. People told me my kids deserved a grandmother, but both kids reckon they would of been much happier never having that 'blight' on their lives.", "NTA, what he did is perfectly normal in her home but it is not ok. You're trying to raise your children to be good people and part of that means breaking the cycle of violence. Why the hell would you let them around someone like your Dad is beyond me.

Your mom is an enabler, and the last thing you want is for them to teach your children their toxic dynamic.", "NTA. You don't want your kids thinking blowing up like that is normal. And you don't want them thinking your mom's enabling of his blowing up is normal either. On top of that it was scaring your kids. Protect your kids and yourself.", "NTA- and I would check your state as they might sue for grandparent rights.\n\nBut absolutely protect your children.  I've had to.  It's not easy but it's what a parent does.", "I would add the opposite too : if your the grand-father wants a relationship with thekids, he needs to put in serious effort in anger management.", "That's not a reason to risk seeing your father."]}
