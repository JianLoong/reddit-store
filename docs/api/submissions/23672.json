Personally, if my friends father kept doing that while I'm talking I'd probably feel kind of uncomfortable. I mean, im hanging out with my friend not their dad.

Rein in your husband's behavior before he paints himself as a racist and your kid loses his new friend.  \n\n\nConsider this: If your husband went up to a grown woman speaking Spanish and asked them what they were saying if they were talking to themselves in a language they are comfortable with would it be ok? Like, if he was at the store and just butted over to a woman near him or in line at the bank and demanded she tell him what she was saying in Spanish. Would that be fine?
