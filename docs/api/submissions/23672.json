Personally, if my friends father kept doing that while I'm talking I'd probably feel kind of uncomfortable. I mean, im hanging out with my friend not their dad.

Like, if he was at the store and just butted over to a woman near him or in line at the bank and demanded she tell him what she was saying in Spanish. Would that be fine?

A 12 year old boy and a 12 year old girl, talking in a language the adults don\u2019t speak- must be talking dirty. Better put a balloon between them", "Now I'm not a parent so if I'm wrong I'm wrong flat out. But isn't he supposed to know have an idea about what's being said to his kid by other children. All the horrible stories everyday are usually followed by \"They were good kids never saw it coming\"  \n\n12yo is very impressionable age easily manipulated (not saying that's this situation) I guess I just think if he's not being pushy/aggressively talking down to the child what's wrong with asking a quick question especially if nothing bad is being discussed.\n\nNow if a grown man is coming out with attitude or saying something moronic like \"speak English/ English only house\" then yes problematic but again maybe he is trying to learn/ keep up to be more involved. For all we know he's up at night trying to learn Spanish and who better to talk to than a native speaker?", "Go to Google translate.  Press the button that looks like a microphone while the other person speaks.  Voila!", "Methinks a better phrase for him is \u00a1pendejo racista!", "I love this!!!", "Oh, that last line just *made my night!*", "What are some of the other explanations out of interest? To me it's vaguely racist, I do think calling him a racist is a little OTT, be nice to differentiate between that and using slurs etc.", "No. Just read the post and the comments. She is talking to the son. Just the son. Dad is sticking his nose in.", "Nobody is plotting a drug deal by calling the dog a Spanish pet name.", "I know how to work Google translate, thank you very much. \n\nThis is stupid. He shouldn\u2019t be asking what she\u2019s saying every time she speaks a word of Spanish anyway. Which is why I agreed that he was an AH in the first place. \n\nYour suggestion of him going up to her and having her speak into the microphone of his phone every time she utters a word in Spanish is stupider than him constantly asking what she said in Spanish, which is already pretty stupid anyway.", "INFO: If a kid who only speaks English is at your house and your husband hears that kid say something but couldn't understand it (the kid mumbled, or the TV was on, or they were just too far apart), does your husband go find the kid and demand the kid repeat what s/he said? Because if he doesn't \u2013 if he only does this to the little Hispanic girl, but has never done it to English speakers \u2013 he is absolutely xenophobic, and quite likely also racist.", "Sounds like a great way for your kid to pick up on a little Spanish! NTA, your husband is though", "So it's more like a slip of the tongue which I can imagine it is easy for someone who is bilingual.  Accidently slipping into their 1st language for a single word or two.  Maybe not even intentional most the time.\n\nYour husband feel like a big man now?  Afraid of a 12 year old's accidental words and has to put her in her place?", "u/lylemcd Pointed one out, but in general it could easily be insecurity or even his own trauma of some sort. There are two possible options I see, although there could be others: either he's upset that it's not English being spoken in his house - which may or may not be due to racism (e.g., it could be racism, or it could be xenophobia, simple intolerance, or something else) - or it could be that he's upset that he can't understand what's being said, which could be due to a whole lot of reasons totally unrelated to racism.\n\nMaybe the dude is racist, I don't know. But it really annoys me how judgmental and close-minded some people can be. Especially when they act like they somehow have the moral high-ground by immediately crying \"racist\" or \"fascist\" as soon as they spot an opportunity - and then people here support it.\n\nDude is getting ratio'd just for \\*suggesting\\* that there might be some other possibility.", "How unless of course he did something crazy like idk ask? Would he know just talking about the dog. And sadly drug's these day's would be a parent's dream all the crazy sh#t these little kid's are out here doing.\n\nObviously if I'm with my wife's family and they start speaking French unless I ask they could be plotting my replacement. If I don't ask I'm 100% out of the loop. \n\nLike I said maybe I'm wrong about this. I just don't see anywhere op said he was being malicious or demanding. Simply asking a question isn't bullying or being unreasonable. Being aggressive would be problematic but to say \"hey, what's that mean?\" The audacity of the man!", "Funny part is that she may do it totally unconsciously by simply replacing some words or phrases which don't translate directly or don't have English equivalent, or in the flow of conversation she knows better the Spanish word or it feels more appropriate, and it happens automatically. I am a grown ass woman, and I do that. When I speak German, I sometimes throw French words or idioms for no reason and I don't even notice unless somebody asks about that. It's normal for people who speak multiple languages to do that. And I agree, husband seems to bully the kiddo. If she was speaking to him, and he wanted translation, I could understand, but going to another room to pick on kids talking to each other is really strange.", ">Funny part is that she may do it totally unconsciously by simply replacing some words or phrases which don't translate directly or don't have English equivalent, or in the flow of conversation she knows better the Spanish word or it feels more appropriate, and it happens automatically. \n\nMy best friend spoke Spanish at home but I didn't. I remember sometimes when she was speaking, she'd break out into Spanish and it was weird because I'd understand her. Must have been the context. She'd just stop when she realized and then said, \"You understood me!\"", "I speak Spanish and English. English is my first language, but every once in a while I\u2019ll have been practicing Spanish so much that I forget English words occasionally. The poor kid is probably just getting mixed up. Knowing multiple languages is hard"]}
