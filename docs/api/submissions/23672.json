Her parents both work, so she usually comes over here. She's Hispanic and she sometimes says things in Spanish. Whenever she says anything in Spanish my husband will ask her what she said, even if she's in an entirely different room.\n\nLike yesterday, I was in the living room watching them play, and my husband was in the kitchen. She said something in Spanish, and he came out of the kitchen and asked her to repeat herself and explain the translation. I felt so embarrassed. She looked confused, and it was just so awkward. She wasn't talking to him, why does it matter?\n\nI told him today that I would like him to stop, and he looked at me like I was crazy. He said we should know what the kids are saying in our house. I said it was embarrassing, and he asked me if I was seriously worried about what a twelve year old thought of us? I came away from the conversation feeling really stupid.\n\nI know it's a harmless question, and I shouldn't make such a big deal about it, but I often feel embarrassed in awkward situations, and it always feels so awkward when he does this.

He's essentially eavesdropping though.", "INFO\n\nDoes *your son* speak Spanish? Or is this child just talking to herself?", "NTA, does he *want* to ruin your son\u2018s friendship or is he just thick? Of course the kid is going to feel uncomfortable knowing he\u2019s eavesdropping the whole time to make sure she only speaks English. It\u2019s just a matter of time until she stops coming because of that creepy dad. \nIt\u2019s such a great opportunity for your child to grow up learning a few phrases in another language, every little helps and nothing is more motivating than real-life experience!", "I'm sorry to say but it's really giving \n\n\"we only speak English in this house\" vibes \n\nwhich is quite scary...\nOP is NTA", "What ever your husband doing is filled with micro aggressions, and if I ever witnessed someone talking to my child like that, I would never let them near that person again. Wtf does he think he is assuming 12 year is only speaking Spanish to curse them out or say bad things. Also the fact he is asking the same person to translate what they are saying. Is the epitome of stupid. Finally why are you letting your child near someone you don\u2019t trust speak in their own fucking language. He can FUCK OFF\n\nEdit \nIf there is nothing to be embarrassed about why not inform the parents of his behavior. Give them the option to see if they trust you around there kids", "NTA. But ngl this is... very concerning. Giving off white supremacy/English only in America vibes. I'd reflect on if you've noticed any other potential racist behaviors and address that.", "NTA, but your husband is. You should show him this thread. It's normal for bilingual kids to throw few phrases in here and there. She doesn't do it to say something nasty.", "Your husband is racist. NTA", "NTA I don't think you're in the wrong at all, I think it's rude to butt in and always ask for translation when the child isn't talking to him. I guess its okay to ask for translation sometimes, for example if she YELLED something in spanish, but normally i think he should just let the kids be. Personally, if my friends father kept doing that while I'm talking I'd probably feel kind of uncomfortable. I mean, im hanging out with my friend not their dad. And If i was a parent, I'd probably want my kids friend to like me or just be on good terms with them and for them to feel comfortable around me, so i think it's good that you care for that!", "He is being an AH. You are not wrong, and he needs his behavior checked. My family occasionally speaks French. Would he do it to MY kids????", "NTA. Your husband is rude and you SHOULD care what a 12yo thinks of you. She can go home to her parents or really tell anyone that your husband badgers her about things she is saying that have NOTHING to do with him. He will come off as your kid's racist dad and eventually maybe that girl wont be allowed to come over anymore or maybe she wont want to come over anymore. Rein in your husband's behavior before he paints himself as a racist and your kid loses his new friend.  \n\n\nConsider this: If your husband went up to a grown woman speaking Spanish and asked them what they were saying if they were talking to themselves in a language they are comfortable with would it be ok? Like, if he was at the store and just butted over to a woman near him or in line at the bank and demanded she tell him what she was saying in Spanish. Would that be fine? He is getting away with it because this is a child who is a GUEST IN YOUR HOME. Just because she is a child does not mean he has a right to harass her for speaking her language.", "NTA. If your husband is so concerned about not understanding Spanish, it\u2019s simple: learn it. Duolingo is great!", "NTA, but your husband is an insecure idiot who needs to stop that behavior right fuckin now. If he\u2019s so concerned about what a 12 year old is saying go learn Spanish instead. Even if she is talking shit, why would she translate it dumbass.", "What tone is he using? Is it aggressive, is it because he is concerned? Was it in general conversation, where everyone was participating? \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly understandable to ask somebody to repeat something you don\u2019t understand or clarify it. That is what healthy communication is.", "Lol wow surprised me to see how many people have a problem with him asking what did you just say. All the racism comments are amusing as well. Guy literally asking what someone just said with from what I understand no attitude or rudeness to it.\n\nMaybe he wants to learn Spanish? I know the audacity is just too much . Talk about manufacturing problems when they don't exist. Op didn't say he was being hostile just asking \"What did you say\" unless I'm missing where he scolds the child? Nobody's an AH here", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I think you care whether a 12 year old guest is being made to feel uncomfortable in your home. And you\u2019re absolutely right to care about that. And the fact is that she is being made to feel that way. Your husband is rude, a bully, and probably racist. NTA", "So to recap:\n\n\\- he bullies a child for speaking her native tongue.\n\n\\- he bullies her even though from context, she isn't being rude or disrespectful. she's just expressing her happy little kid feelings, and he HATES that.\n\n\\- he bullies and makes YOU feel stupid and embarrassed when you dare to speak up\n\nso either he's one or more of the following:\n\nmisogynist (and hates on all the females in the house), racist, a bully, gaslighting you into thinking you are misunderstanding what the child is doing... HE has a problem with the child speaking Spanish but he turns it around to make it seem like YOU are the one who's stupid to feel embarrassed in front of a child. \n\nYou are only questioning your reaction because your husband turned it around to make you the weirdo here or the bad guy. \n\nI strongly urge you OP to start thinking of other instances where he does this you.... and you end up listening to him and thinking that you were in the wrong to think/feel/believe something.... \n\nNTA", "NTA, but it\u2019s possible he is concerned because of their age and gender, thinking she might be saying something sexual?

I think he has figured out some of the words she uses often.

It's usually a word or phrase and sometimes a sentence.", "So, normal speech. It's like when a southerner says something like, \"bless your heart\" or calls something a \"critter\" while speaking. She's speaking normally & there's absolutely nothing wrong or unusual saying something in another language. The fact that he makes a fool of himself by butting into conversations just to (not so subtly because *she* knows if nobody else does) have her speak English instead of Spanish speaks volumes about him. He literally came from another room & made a show for nothing. If he's figured out some of the things she's been saying, then he can get an app/book & figure out the rest. What he's doing is nonsense & racist even though he's making excuses by using \"knowing what the kids are saying\".\n\nYou're NTA, but your husband sure is."]}
