Annabelle has ADHD and struggles with impulse control (this is what I'm told/excuse I'm given by her dad- I'm by no means a medical professional). She's actually a kick ass kid. She's artistic, absolutely hilarious, super smart (when she can focus) and has a lot of passionate viewpoints that are admirable. But her downfall is that she destroys pretty much everything she touches. Her expensive memory foam mattress has giant chunks that she ripped off of it. Her wall has peeled off paint everywhere because she took her Scentsy candle and poured the hot wax on the walls to see what it would look like and peeled off the paint trying to hide the evidence. Her windowsills are covered in nail polish and make up because she still draws on walls. Same with my kitchen table. I own the house and it's bothersome to me that she's destroying it, with the excuse of \"I don't know why I did it, I just wanted to and couldn't stop myself\". She's been in therapy for awhile. \n\nBut anyways, she kicked a soccer ball in my living room 2 weeks ago and broke my 60\" wall hanging tv. As a punishment, her dad took her TV out of her room but instead of putting in the living room, we hooked it up in our bedroom because he grounded her. It's a smaller TV (26\"). I insisted that she was also made to pay for another TV for the living room with her allowance/chore money but my husband was against that punishment. I didn't push it because it's not my place. However, she's been asking for the TV back and I've said no. I don't have a TV anymore because she broke mine and until my TV gets replaced, I don't think I should be made to give it back. Especially where I have nothing to do during the day since I'm newly postpartum and nursing the baby. She on the other hand has her tablet and doesn't need the TV. Annabelle is pissed. Slamming doors is a new thing of hers because she says I \"stole\" her TV and that her breaking mine was an accident. I will admit it's not about punishment at this point.
