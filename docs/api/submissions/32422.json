She's artistic, absolutely hilarious, super smart (when she can focus) and has a lot of passionate viewpoints that are admirable. But her downfall is that she destroys pretty much everything she touches. Her expensive memory foam mattress has giant chunks that she ripped off of it.

She's been in therapy for awhile. \n\nBut anyways, she kicked a soccer ball in my living room 2 weeks ago and broke my 60\" wall hanging tv. As a punishment, her dad took her TV out of her room but instead of putting in the living room, we hooked it up in our bedroom because he grounded her. It's a smaller TV (26\"). I insisted that she was also made to pay for another TV for the living room with her allowance/chore money but my husband was against that punishment. I didn't push it because it's not my place. However, she's been asking for the TV back and I've said no. I don't have a TV anymore because she broke mine and until my TV gets replaced, I don't think I should be made to give it back. Especially where I have nothing to do during the day since I'm newly postpartum and nursing the baby. She on the other hand has her tablet and doesn't need the TV. Annabelle is pissed.

The mattress picking is a thing she likely has 0 idea she is doing. Drawing on the walls is borderline (blackboard paint and wallpaper is a thing btw) but the kitchen table is a behavior that needs to be addressed. \n\nThat aside, i noticed in a comment about the money for the TV. Unless she is saving specifically for something, ultimately teaching her a lesson by her paying for it is likely not going to be impactful. She has very little concept of how that's a problem for future her because current her doesn't exactly need that money.  \n\nHonestly, husband/dad needs to replace the broken TV. He's crossing the line between \"understanding\" and \"enabling\" the behaviors. she can have hers back with the understanding that while accidents do happen, there are still consequences (i.e. if we are kicking the ball in the house again, the TV goes away even if nothing gets broken. We don't kick balls in the house because things can get broken, we have seen it happen once already.  It was an accident the first time but now you know what CAN happen from kicking the ball in the house and that means of it happens again, then it isn't an accident.)\n\nAlso,  fidget toys....several fidget toys... will save the mattress.

The problem is that your house is the only place she can get that, so she's choosing to experience and experiment on your house over her wish to please you by not destroying your house.\n\nYou and your husband need to find an outlet for her creative and destructive learning methods before it breaks your house and marriage. \n\nIn parallel, she definitely needs to understand the very important concept of not breaking other people's stuff. I think teaching this would only work if you address the former issue", "NTA. However you have a husband problem. She\u2019s 11, but your husband enables her when she\u2019s destroying property which isn\u2019t his. Your husband needs to replace (the same tv not a lesser model) the broken items.

Both in the types of behaviours and socially (as well as academically).  No one she hangs out with is going to want to put up with this and friends parents will encourage their kids not to have anything to do with her as they may do the same things as her.. or their things get broken by her.  \n\nShe needs a proper assessment and serious consideration for some medication to help curb some of the impulsiveness.  Her brain chemicals are in a non optimal ratio and her brain is looking for dopamine that it finds with the behaviours.  No amount of telling her brain to stop doing those things will make it make more dopamine.  She may need the stimulant to do that.  A stimulant speeds the brain up to calm it and organise itself with the correct ratio of brain chemicals and she'll make better decisions she's thought through a bit more.\n\nThe danger of not medicating a person that really needs it is the lack of self esteem, anxiety, dangerous impulsive decisions (which can be made at school and in the community and have legal ramifications for her) and the propensity for self medicating with drugs and alcohol to try and fix that brain chemical ratio.\n\nAs for the tv, it's a natural consequence that she doesn't have one till yours is replaced because she broke it.  Yes it probably was an accident but it doesn't mean there aren't consequences for it and yes she should be paying for a new one... otherwise it only comes out of your pocket.  And if it does, something else may need to be passed up and preferably something fun that your stepdaughter could've done (but not a necessity) but you've used that money to replace your tv.\n\nYour consequences are not as harsh as what she's going to experience in school and the real world.\n\nDoes she spend much time with her mother?  What does she think?  \n\nIf nothing changes, then things are going to be rough and it will only get worse.  It is your house though and you get to decide who lives there.
