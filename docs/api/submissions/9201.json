Please send help.", "Um what?", "I\u2019m so sorry that\u2019s your reality right now. The end of the pregnancy is the toughest couple weeks to get through especially when you\u2019re taking care of other small humans. I wish I could come over and lend a hand. I hope you\u2019re getting some rest that you need. You\u2019re carrying and growing a human, you deserve that.", "And she's diabetic. Is he going to be there for OP if her diabetes causes her major complications after the baby is born, or is he going to take the kid and run?", "I still have an iron but I only need it when I need to melt something. The idea of routinely ironing cloths is bizarre", "I only own one because I found one in new condition in my apartment\u2019s bin room. I\u2019ve used it a couple of times, I think?", "I bought an iron too, it's still in the box, it's been like 3 yrs already...", "I bought an iron when I first moved out on my own 20 years ago.  I used it twice.  I just recently bought a new one for perler bead projects with my son\u2026lol", "I'm 50. I've owned a couple because I used them so infrequently that I either gave the first one away or couldn't find it. We use an iron about once every 18 months. I can't imagine ironing all the time.", "Right? I make a game of trying to see how far I can be away from the dresser and still throw them in successfully\n\nWhy in the fuck would someone iron or even fold workout clothes?", "I select my business attire based on how it looks without ironing. I just know if it needs ironing I\u2019m unlikely to ever wear it!", "But it's the pelvic thru-ust/\nThat really straightens the se-se-seaaam!/\nLet's do/\nThe vag press/\nAgaiiiiin!/", "\"Estrogen activated\"  \ud83e\udd23", "I mean, the handle is ergonomically designed to fit a vag. Can\u2019t use one of those tall ironing boards tho. I\u2019m a short gal.", "Lol. I also hate ironing. Maybe once a year or so I iron the tablecloths before a holiday party, but just the bare minimum to get the worst of the wrinkles out.\nMy partner presses his shirts because he needs dress shirts for work. Sometimes if I have a shirt or dress that\u2019s really wrinkly I take it into the shower with me and let the steam take care of it. My partner once saw me doing this and asked why. When I told him he chuckled at me.", "FYI you are my hero this should be top comment.", "No. Being manipulative is not gaslighting. Gaslighting is making a person question their own reality. Like telling them they did/didn't do something they know they didn't/did do\nEdit: if she had seen him correctly ironing his shirts and then he denied that ever happening, that would be gaslighting", "If I tried that with my mum I would come home with crinkled shirts and an iron shaped bruise on my face.", "Right?? Silly me for thinking all partners give some extra care when you're under the weather.", "Your reply just killed me! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "If Youtube Univeristy can teach me how to swap out a clutch, forge a knife, cook on a budget, and mount drywall, then it can teach OP's hubby how to iron shorts. Pure weaponized incompetence.", "Oh god\u2026", "I really wanted to recommend she abort the moment I saw that she was a high risk pregnancy to the point where her doctor doesn\u2019t recommend it. I know a mom that was high risk and ended up spending the whole third trimester in a hospital ward and the baby still had to come out two months early. Then the baby had to stay at NICU for another two months. Good thing was she had amazing health insurance and lots of money. OP might not be as lucky and she\u2019ll be hit with a huge hospital bill.", "I agree. OP, children are a lot of work and require a lot of energy, and patience. Please prepare to parent all alone. There\u2019s no way this guy is going to step up to be a partner if he can\u2019t even iron his own shirt.", "I\u2019m glad you said it. I\u2019m only hopeful she\u2019s still early enough she can have an abortion (if she chooses). Co-parenting with this AH is going to be mentally exhausting. Let alone she\u2019ll be doing it essentially alone. Kids are hard, on every facet of our lives. I have three daughters who I love, being a mother meant everything to me, but I\u2019m glad they are grown and the raising them part is over.", "Agreed adoption is an option if you truly want. Cause it doesn't sound like this guy is going to be a supportive partner, much less a hands on dad.", "I just hope OP isn't in the U.S. because there's multiple states banning it now.", "that was my first thought too. Was told by professionals to not get pregnant, then finds out she is pregnant ..... am I paranoid or does it smell like something was sabotaged ...", "OP, seriously ask yourself this question. What does he bring to the table? How does he make your life better? Are things easier when he\u2019s there or when he\u2019s gone? If you do gain something from his presence, is it enough to make all the work you do for him worth it? Is all of this going to be better or worse when the baby is here?", "I'm so sorry about your friend. Did she have a glioblastoma? Those take people so fast it isn't right.", "So there's this one quite rare type of brain cancer that's *really* slow growing. Iirc it's almost more if a weird growth defect than cancer, really. It always develops in children or teens, and is usually caught and operated on then, but not always - I've got a friend who started getting Mystery Headaches in her late 20s and after eventually arguing her way to a brain scan they found the tumor.\n\nShe was luckier than OP's mother, it was operable and she's 90% recovered now. But it had been growing in for more than a decade when they found it, and the tumor itself was still only (\"only\") the size of a peach pit.", "Oh he'll be running but I seriously doubt he'd take the kid.", "We iron fancy clothes and that's about it. Regular T shirts? Why? Lol", "Haha I was shopping for apartment necessities and was like. Oh every adult has an iron!", "I did the same! \ud83d\ude01 I heard some people out there in the world iron their underwear and bed sheets - to each their own but to me that is insane and such a waste of time! One they are on your butt/ the bed if you've put them on properly nobody can tell if they've been ironed or not!", "Seconded, plenty of laundromats offer pressing service. Tell him it's one of the requirements of him moving back in a long with a list of chores. If he doesn't come back we'll there's a bunch of chores you don't need to do there either.\n\nNTA", "He gets aggravated because he can't dress himself..... That pretty much tells you all you need to know. NTA cause he's a baby and left the house simply cause he doesn't like your brothers. But you need a better solution going forward", "If this man can't handle wrinkly gym shirts, he is *IN ABSOLUTELY NO WAY* prepared for the upheaval an infant will bring. Do you want this man lashing out at your child?", "OP imagine an 18 year old said this to you about her 27 year old bf. You know this is NOT OK.", "There's the pregnancy, but then what? I was reading and thinking a baby/toddler is infinitely louder and more difficult to quiet down than a man with a stereo. If that's a nonnegotiable event during a migraine, what's going to happen after the baby is born?", "There are always camping trips.", "I just hang my dresses in the bathroom while i shower before wearing them.", "It\u2019s slang. OP\u2019s husband didn\u2019t invent it. But it\u2019s concerning that she accepts this as normal.", "Neither, aggy is just slang. I use aggro not aggy but it\u2019s just regional variation", "That's a really good point too (though this pregnancy really doesn't look planned, either through an accident or otherwise) and is probably a sign that considering adoption (either through mutual family or through some kind of system) may also be a good idea if these migraines aren't caused by the pregnancy (which wouldn't exactly be the first time pregnancy has caused migraines).", "Whether it should or it shouldn't doesn't really change the fact that it is. Given the deep-rooted social/cultural/religious baggage surrounding the issue, that's probably not likely to change anytime soon, at least not for many people.", "Omg TIL that plus one can make it from 2 parts water 1 part vinegar (the clean one for cleaning ofc). My my! (Though my policy is to not buy wrinkle-prone clothes as much as I can)", "People don\u2019t always really know it\u2019s an option ~for them~ though. Especially if you\u2019re married, or financially stable, or already a parent. Decades of propaganda have taught us that abortion is either outright evil, or at best, a necessary evil to be used only in rare situations. \n\nSometimes people need to hear that abortion is for anyone who wants an abortion!", "There are a lot of people who think it\u2019s not a real option if you\u2019re in a relationship. Not that it\u2019s illegal or something, but just that it\u2019s **not done**. So it doesn\u2019t hurt to remind them that it isn\u2019t an option only for single people. (Though hopefully she\u2019ll also be single soon.)", "This. It's such a deeply personal subject that it becomes a touchy subject for advice, particularly when it's coming from someone who's not particularly close.", "Way off topic but thank you! I was a speech and debate kid 10 years ago! My boyfriend asked me the other day why I'm so obsessive about my clothes being ironed and perfectly lint free. He didn't believe me when I said it was an old debate habit and that we'd get deductions for not being wrinkle and lint free! I'm showing him your comment!", "It's an emotionally charged subject for many people so it's not the kind of thing they're ever going to see in a completely neutral light. Saying that it's an option for them will never completely be able to alleviate complicated feelings they may have on the matter.", "It\u2019s an emotionally charged subject BECAUSE the narrative around abortion is that it should be shameful and rare. If we treat it like the normal medical procedure that it is, we can combat that narrative and the complicated feelings it causes."]}
