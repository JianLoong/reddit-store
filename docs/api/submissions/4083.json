This meant our parents focused a lot on curing it and they expected me to be on hand to entertain her, to keep her mind off of cancer, and to make sure she felt loved. There were times my parents scolded me for watching TV while she was sick because how could I take my focus off of her. She would try to get the attention of everyone after a while. We were left out of a couple of family weddings when we were kids because the bride and groom didn't want her and my parents making her the center of attention on the day. They already did that to my mom's sister. Her wedding day my sister puked that morning and my parents decided to tell the whole family beforehand because we'd be late. Then they showed up at the church and mom went to the front with my sister and announced to everyone that my sister was okay. My aunt was so mad at her for that. She then had my sister go up to them when they were exchanging vows and give them both a kiss. My aunt actually stopped talking to my mom after that shit show.\n\nMy sister is used to telling everyone she knows she had cancer, that she's got bad lungs still and she's probably going to need more surgeries in the future (because her liver or kidneys were harmed by her cancer treatments).\n\nI admit to resenting the attention she gets. When I was 17 she asked me why I never pay the same kind of attention that our parents do and I told her because she's not the only kid I know who survived cancer and because in the real world people aren't taking their focus off everything to focus on her, or any other cancer survivor. I told her it was rude to bring it up when someone else was celebrating or focusing on something. She asked me how it could be rude when people never tell her to stop. I told her people told mom and dad to stop, they just didn't listen and because she was a kid they wouldn't say it directly to her.\n\nI kind of walked away from my family after I moved out. My sister reached out to me recently though and wanted us to catch up. I was open to it but once she got here she started telling everyone about her cancer, she asked me to take days off work to spend with her because cancer and bored. My girlfriend was over and she pestered her for hours while I was at work and then called to complain to me that my girlfriend wouldn't entertain her. When I got home that night I told her if she wants to be the center of attention that she needs to go to our parents, because she won't get that anywhere else.

Advise her that she needs to see a therapist, that your parents will never initiate it as it may reflect badly on them, so it has to be her decision.

It is very sad she had cancer but your parents have made that her entire identity in lieu of actually teaching her functional social norms and have tried ti make that horrible period in your family's life the only thing that matters.

It's not going to be easy to release yourself from that upbringing.  You are not in charge of how your sister feels.  You don't have to be supportive of her emotionally crippled self, but I am afraid you are going to feel enormous guilt about your decision.  Find a way to fully explore how you feel about your sister and your parents.  No one is perfect, but the way your parents dealt with their fear of losing a child was to her and your detriment.", "NTA, but I feel heartbroken over her, because your parents created a monster with unrealistic expectations of others for her and it will probably take her the next 10 years of regular rejections and people avoiding her for her to realise she actually is insufferable and needs to change. They teach her this behaviour and all she will get from that is hate.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not your fault nor your problem though and you can catch up in ten years when time and life will probably have helped her understand. Don\u2019t let her or your parents guilt trip you, what you\u2019re doing is actually good for her. You\u2019re showing her that others life do not revolve around her and that her behaviour is actually not acceptable.

No, then stop talking about it.\"  She needs to find something else to focus on - maybe education or a career of some sort, but to stop with the \"poor me\" song.

And that isn\u2019t the fault of the sick child, the healthy child, or the parents. It is just the unfortunate reality. A family with young child with cancer is stretched so incredibly thin - financially and emotionally - that sometimes hard decisions around how to allocate that family\u2019s resources end up being unfair to the healthy child. But your parents should have acknowledged that reality and made every effort to balance the scales where they could.\n\nExpecting their child to be grateful for their health *in lieu of* having involved and present parents was beyond unreasonable.

You gave your sister several good doses of reality that she is going to need to function successfully in the real world.\n\nYour sister is my mom. Mom was born significantly disabled. Obv, I don't know what she was like as a kid, but my early recollections are of her going to into painful details all the time to everyone about her handicap, her divorce from my father, etc. And of course the answer always was from adults \"you poor thing and you are amazing.\" From what I hear from my uncle, when my mom was young, she was amazing. But it's like she got addicted to hearing how amazing she was.... \n\nIt's really hard on the \"normal\" siblings or kids. We still need time and attention, and we are entirely overshadowed by the other. On the other hand, the disabled (or very sick) kid really does have a harder row to hoe. Leads to guilt and resentment. \n\nBut here is the thing - those people who praised my mom? They disappear. Because having someone completely self-involved with their own hardships and who is used to having everyone around them entirely invested in their hardships are a drag. They aren't good friends, they aren't good life partners, and they aren't good parents. Look, sometimes, it really isn't ALL ABOUT YOU. \n\nYour sister is paying the price of your parents' bad parenting - she thinks she is the center of the world. One day, your parents won't be around, and your sister will have alienated so many around her. This has happened to my mom. Maybe your frank comments will get through. Otherwise, she's going to look around herself after twenty years and wonder why she's so isolated.", "NTA. Your parents have created this situation but she is an adult now and can take some responsibility. \n\nI understand how difficult it must have been for your parents and that they are so thankful she is a survivor. But they have gone to the far extreme of making her the center of everyone\u2019s universe and interrupting other people special occasions. \n\nI am sorry you had to grow up in her shadow and your sister does not seem to want to give that up. I agree that taking some space from her might be the only way to handle it unless she grows up a bit. Some people eventually get it but many never do and just marry someone that worships them and then they are even more insufferable!", "NTA, she\u2019ll use cancer to keep drawing attention from everyone as long as it continues to work.

Doesn't mean you have to hold onto it, but your feelings are totally valid. And it's disrespectful to use a disease to fuel someone's ego. I believe parents wanted a good chunk of attention for themselves.\n\n I am more concerned of your sister. She will get an ugly reality check pretty bad pretty fast. Also I sincerely hope her cancer won't ever come back. Personally had a monster of a cyst relaps in my 30's. Boy it came back strong, I had it when I was 5 and I don't remember much.

And all I could think of was what a good mom she was, as she didn't treat them any different from any other kid, and disciplined them when they were being bratty.

In this sub it seems to be very common for parents to prioritize the sick kid and ignore/neglect the healthy kid(s). If they actually gave a fuck, they would have given both of you the attention and care you needed. I won't lie, having a sick kid is hard. You live in a constant fear that will probably never go away. It's not fair and it sucks. But that is for the parents to deal with. My son isn't even 2 and has seen so many Dr's and been to the hospital and Dr's offices so much that if you put him in a room with any family member that doesn't live with us and someone dressed in scrubs, he will go to whoever is wearing the scrubs. That's his normal. But my 2 daughters are not going to suffer and be neglected because their brother has issues. My girls have normal lives. They play they have fun they do what they want to do in their free time. And they love their brother so much. If I do need help with him, they will do it because they love him and want to.
