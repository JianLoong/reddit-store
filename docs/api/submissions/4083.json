I told her it was rude to bring it up when someone else was celebrating or focusing on something. She asked me how it could be rude when people never tell her to stop. I told her people told mom and dad to stop, they just didn't listen and because she was a kid they wouldn't say it directly to her.\n\nI kind of walked away from my family after I moved out.

It sounds like you had a very neglected childhood and that\u2019s just not fair to you. I wish you all the best. \n\nHonestly, I wish your sister the best too. She\u2019s right, being sick is rough and when you\u2019re sick long enough sometimes\u2026 it\u2019s all you know to talk about. However, I think she\u2019s had time to rewire that thinking and just hasn\u2019t because your parents have made it their highest priority to have a sick kid. It\u2019s not only attention for the kid. They got attention out of it too.", "NTA. I have a son with a heart defect, and he's had multiple surgeries.  One of the bits of advice   I received (counseling was a part of preparing me to bring him home) was to avoid the temptation to overcompensate for what he went through by spoiling him or making him the center of attention,  because despite his troubles,  he's still a child and needs discipline and boundaries to get through life. I followed that advice, and he wasn't treated any differently from my other kids, behaviorally. \n\nYour sister is the result of their not doing something similar, and is their problem, not yours. I think your response was blunt, but good.", "NTA. Your sole purpose in life isn't to cater to your sisters needs, despite her medical condition.

Imagine moaning to you that your girlfriend isn\u2019t entertaining her, how bratty is that. Your parents need to take responsibility too.

My baby sister and I were very close when she was a baby. She was very sick. I lost her in 2015 and miss her till this day. IMHO, the sole difference here, my sister wasn\u2019t treated like a porcelain doll. My parents were very caring to her, but didn\u2019t forget they had another child,me. While I do blame your parents for a lot of this, when she was a child, I blame your sister for thinking the only attention she can get is for her health issues, as an adult. I think she could use some therapy. Maybe you could even talk to someone. Your parents really made things MUCH worse for your sister:(Best of luck to you!", "NTA. I'm sorry, a grown ass women needs to be the center of attention and be entertained because she had cancer as a kid, 20 YEARS ago, wtf. And your parents. How do people like this actually exist? Lose all their numbers, go no contact,  and move on.", "NTA. Your parents taught her to be this way and until she gets a reality check from the real world she will continue to act like the self indulged brat she was raised to be. Your parents have taught her the only thing of value about her is her being sick and having cancer. It really is awful. \n\nI am sorry your parents made you a second class citizen. I think having low or no contact is best.", "NTA.\n\nYou just told her the truth, and it sounds like you said it in a way that was direct and to the point without being mean.\n\nFrom her point of view I expect she does think it isn't fair, probably from many perspectives. \n\nShe is hurt that you don't want her around and how dare you tell her that because mommy and daddy always told you to do whatever to keep her happy.\n\nSo she has expectations from the past. Time to make it very clear to her that her expectations are out of date and that as grownups you all can choose how to live your life now and you chose not to be told what to do by your parents. \n\nThat past behaviour isn't a predictor of the future and when you were beholden to your parents you did what they asked and that was entertain her and now you are not and you don't have to do that and therefore you are chosing not to cater to her needs. \n\nIt isn't about fair and not fair, it is about making a choice and she can make a choice to rely on herself and not others, to chose to learn how to be an adult or remain as a child dependent on others. Just like you did.", "NTA.  Your parents did your sister no favors.

How will she cope then?", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re completely right, she needs to go home if she wants 24/7 attention. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that.

Cancer sucks, but sounds like your mother and sister are milking it for attention.", "INFO- Why do you think your parents started this behavior? \n\nHave you considered that maybe your sister is redeemable because this is a learned behaviour, I am guessing you are the only one who has ever talked straight to her? \n\nShe is still young and has to learn it the hard way, but with your influence you never know what could happen. \n\nNot saying to do one thing or the other because your feelings are so valid. Your parents are a disgrace and you deserved so much better. \n\nNTA for setting a boundary and sticking to it.

Before you (understandably) go LC with her, if you have any care left for her, you need to be able to have a heart to heart talk or via letter to gently explain her behavior is neither healthy nor normal; that your parents, despite good intentions, did her a disservice to make her believe her traumatic cancer is all that defines her and that is putting people off from knowing her better. Advise her that she needs to see a therapist, that your parents will never initiate it as it may reflect badly on them, so it has to be her decision. Research a good one for her to make convincing her as easy as possible.\n\nIf she doesn't heed your advice, no matter, at least you tried and ball's in her court.", "Not at all.", "NTA. It is very sad she had cancer but your parents have made that her entire identity in lieu of actually teaching her functional social norms and have tried ti make that horrible period in your family's life the only thing that matters. They did her no favors. They did themselves no favors. They did you no favors but fortunately you saw it for what it was and refused to let her cancer define you.", "NTA  You feel badly because you were raised to feel badly if your sister was unhappy.  It's not going to be easy to release yourself from that upbringing.  You are not in charge of how your sister feels.  You don't have to be supportive of her emotionally crippled self, but I am afraid you are going to feel enormous guilt about your decision.  Find a way to fully explore how you feel about your sister and your parents.  No one is perfect, but the way your parents dealt with their fear of losing a child was to her and your detriment.", "NTA, but I feel heartbroken over her, because your parents created a monster with unrealistic expectations of others for her and it will probably take her the next 10 years of regular rejections and people avoiding her for her to realise she actually is insufferable and needs to change. They teach her this behaviour and all she will get from that is hate.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not your fault nor your problem though and you can catch up in ten years when time and life will probably have helped her understand. Don\u2019t let her or your parents guilt trip you, what you\u2019re doing is actually good for her. You\u2019re showing her that others life do not revolve around her and that her behaviour is actually not acceptable. No cancer card for that.", "Ah, my parents like to say that the healthy kid needs to understand that their health more than makes up for a lack of attention. Because what would happen if the sick kid(s) died and the attention was on the healthy one.", "I technically didn't. I agreed to meet up with her and she sort of invited herself over. I only went along because on the phone she sounded more grown and less... demanding overall. But that went out the window once she arrived.", "They did a lot of harm and they had a fucked mindset. But they also wouldn't listen to reason from anyone so it was always going to end up this way. It might be too late for my sister since my parents seem to be keeping her the center of their universe and if she doesn't move away from that much, she's going to be far too old when she realizes and it will likely break her.", "She's already pushed a lot of people away. I'm not sure she really has any friends anymore.

Not judging you here.", "I agree. But they always said that's just how things are because you never know when you'll lose the sick one.
