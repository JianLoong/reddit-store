This meant our parents focused a lot on curing it and they expected me to be on hand to entertain her, to keep her mind off of cancer, and to make sure she felt loved. There were times my parents scolded me for watching TV while she was sick because how could I take my focus off of her. She would try to get the attention of everyone after a while. We were left out of a couple of family weddings when we were kids because the bride and groom didn't want her and my parents making her the center of attention on the day. They already did that to my mom's sister. Her wedding day my sister puked that morning and my parents decided to tell the whole family beforehand because we'd be late. Then they showed up at the church and mom went to the front with my sister and announced to everyone that my sister was okay. My aunt was so mad at her for that. She then had my sister go up to them when they were exchanging vows and give them both a kiss. My aunt actually stopped talking to my mom after that shit show.\n\nMy sister is used to telling everyone she knows she had cancer, that she's got bad lungs still and she's probably going to need more surgeries in the future (because her liver or kidneys were harmed by her cancer treatments).\n\nI admit to resenting the attention she gets. When I was 17 she asked me why I never pay the same kind of attention that our parents do and I told her because she's not the only kid I know who survived cancer and because in the real world people aren't taking their focus off everything to focus on her, or any other cancer survivor. I told her it was rude to bring it up when someone else was celebrating or focusing on something. She asked me how it could be rude when people never tell her to stop. I told her people told mom and dad to stop, they just didn't listen and because she was a kid they wouldn't say it directly to her.\n\nI kind of walked away from my family after I moved out. My sister reached out to me recently though and wanted us to catch up. I was open to it but once she got here she started telling everyone about her cancer, she asked me to take days off work to spend with her because cancer and bored. My girlfriend was over and she pestered her for hours while I was at work and then called to complain to me that my girlfriend wouldn't entertain her. When I got home that night I told her if she wants to be the center of attention that she needs to go to our parents, because she won't get that anywhere else.

Advise her that she needs to see a therapist, that your parents will never initiate it as it may reflect badly on them, so it has to be her decision.

You don't have to be supportive of her emotionally crippled self, but I am afraid you are going to feel enormous guilt about your decision.  Find a way to fully explore how you feel about your sister and your parents.  No one is perfect, but the way your parents dealt with their fear of losing a child was to her and your detriment.", "NTA, but I feel heartbroken over her, because your parents created a monster with unrealistic expectations of others for her and it will probably take her the next 10 years of regular rejections and people avoiding her for her to realise she actually is insufferable and needs to change.

Don\u2019t let her or your parents guilt trip you, what you\u2019re doing is actually good for her.

No, then stop talking about it.\"  She needs to find something else to focus on - maybe education or a career of some sort, but to stop with the \"poor me\" song.

And that isn\u2019t the fault of the sick child, the healthy child, or the parents. It is just the unfortunate reality. A family with young child with cancer is stretched so incredibly thin - financially and emotionally - that sometimes hard decisions around how to allocate that family\u2019s resources end up being unfair to the healthy child. But your parents should have acknowledged that reality and made every effort to balance the scales where they could.\n\nExpecting their child to be grateful for their health *in lieu of* having involved and present parents was beyond unreasonable.

Except, my eldest sister was born severely disabled and was never expected to live long, whereas I was at least given a 20% 5 year survival rate, so my mother\u2019s attention remained focused on my sister throughout my and my brothers\u2019 childhood. \n\nI\u2019m now a little younger than your sister is, and I have a very successful full time job as a dentist\u2019s assistant, a part time job as a sign language interpreter, I\u2019m in university a year early doing a double degree for journalism and creative writing on a scholarship with all the highest marks\u2026 and still, the only conversations my mother is able to engage in are about when I was sick and how sick my sister is. \n\nIt drives me up the wall that she cannot get her mindset off the negatives, and continues to spill my very private medical information and personal journey to strangers. Your sister\u2019s old enough to know what oversharing is, and that it\u2019s inappropriate in almost any context. \n\nIt\u2019s not okay to continuously trauma dump on anybody you meet, and I think she needs to learn that it doesn\u2019t matter if her disease was visible, everybody struggles with something. Everybody has struggles that are equivalent in importance to hers. \n\nHonestly, I only learned this lesson myself last year after my eldest brother took his own life\u2014and I saw my sister in law pick herself up and carry on with life, even with two little boys in tow. My illness was a very visible thing, I got praised for how strong I was, yet my sister in law got nothing because nobody saw what she had endured, and she has too much self respect to continuously dump that on everybody. \n\nYour sister hasn\u2019t learned that lesson yet, and I might just sound like a dumb teenager who doesn\u2019t know anything, so don\u2019t take my word for it, but I think it can only come with experience and maturity. She\u2019s not there yet, and it\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re NTA for trying to explain it to her though, and I\u2019m deeply sorry for what you experienced in your childhood. I\u2019ve been on both sides of that, so I\u2019m empathetic toward it, but your sister doesn\u2019t realise how she comes across and the damage it\u2019s done to you. But the suffering you endured while she had Cancer is just as valid as hers. The saying goes, when one person is diagnosed with Cancer, the whole family is.", "Oooh boy.\n\nParent of sick kid & 2 healthy kids.\n\nSick kid gets a lot of my time with appointments, treatments, research.\n\nHealthy kids get as much as I can, in \u201cthinking of you\u201d gifts, putting my sleep aside to make sure they get a chunk of my day too, home made treats baked while on hold/getting results reviewed.\n\nI do not ask my kids to understand their sibling *needs* more.\n\nI ask my kids to understand that I need to meet their needs differently.\n\nOnly once has my teen told me they\u2019re feeling left out, and I have been rectifying that. \n\nYour parents are wrong and you are NTA.", "Yeah no. Health does not make up for lack of attention.", "NTA and I won't reiterate what everyone else has already said because I agree but \u2014\n\nCan you give more detail about your aunt's wedding?? WTF?? Was it a traditional ceremony? Did your sister literally walk up in front of everyone? Were there a lot of guests? I'm so baffled that your parents thought any of that was okay.", "NTA. Your parents sounds very manipulative and gaslighting and your sister sounds very entitled acting.", "NTA. \n\n\nLittle princess has proven what type of person she will always be. Follow your Aunts lead and spend time with family that actually wants to be involved with you. \n\n\nYour parents have  proven she will always come first. So let them have her and you enjoy life without a drama queen.", "[removed]", "Does your sister still have cancer? It's unclear as you said she had it at 3 but she still talks about it like she has cancer?\n\nWhat's that shit where parents get so much attention from a sick child that they end up harming the child to keep the attention coming, this probably isn't a case of that but the parents still absolutely got off from having all that attention. Making someone else's wedding into your own announcement that your kid is fine after they puked earlier? Kids puke all the fucking time, no one gives a shit, get over yourself.\n\nTHe problem is they've turned their sickness over loving the attention into teaching your sister that's normal behaviour. I don't know if there are some good documentaries on youtube somewhere that cover parents who get attention for sick kids, maybe find some and have your sister watch them. Sit her down and explain to her that if she acts this way she won't ever have real friends or even a real life if all she wants to be known for is being sick and never talking about anything else.\n\nHaving chronic illness sucks, and it's very easy to get sucked down into your own despair and never think about anything else, but it also alienates you from everyone else in life the same way depression or other very unhealthy habits tend to make people stay away from you over time.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Being or having a sick kid sucks, but telling their sibling that ignoring them is fine because they still have their health is just awful! Sorry that happened to you.", "In this day and age, any one that can't entertain themselves is just being lazy. \n\n\nI'm on mobile, so in my hand I have a library of a few hundred books, a couple hundred movies, days worth of music, and the entire internet. If it's too small I have a tablet with a bigger screen. Nearby is a gaming system with games that will take me months to finish. Honestly as long as I can order in food I could happily entertain myself for a year.", "That was my first thought. 'OP, your sister needs a lung/kidney/partial liver transplant and you're a match! You need to do it, because she's sick! Then entertain her after the surgery because apparently she can't do that herself with a phone that gives her the whole internet!'", "It\u2019s not your job to, but maybe you could help her out a little here, because her behaviour isn\u2019t healthy. Sounds like she needs someone to show her how to act in the real world. Otherwise she will end up with no one but her Mum and Dad. She\u2019s been used by them to gain attention and doesn\u2019t know any better.", "Your mother created a monster, and you're not wrong for not wanting to deal with it. Your sister will have to learn some day that the world does not revolve around her, and she cannot expect others to \"entertain her\" everywhere she goes. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, you need to take care of you and your mental health needs. It sounds like your sister is dependent upon people making her the center of attention, whether it be good or bad, she just needs it. Send her on her way and go back to the way you were and leave the toxicity alone.", "NTA, and you might find reading Jeanette McCurdy's book, I'm Glad My Mom Died therapeutic. Her mother weaponized her cancer to abuse in a similar way that your parents weaponized your sister's cancer to abuse. \n\nYour sister's life is going to be much harder, not because she had cancer, but because your parents were actively cruel to both of their children.", "NTA and you do your sister the hugest favour by treating her normally and trying to teach her what society away from your parents is going to expect from her in terms of basic manners.  Obviously she and your parents need some professional help, your parents should have got it from day 1.", "NTA. I helped take care of my dying sister for 10 years, so I understand what you\u2019re going through. Though my sister wasn\u2019t the one demanding attention and causing problems. It\u2019s unfortunate your sister is going through that, but she\u2019s manipulating and gaslighting to get what she wants cause she was never told no. I\u2019d go low contact or no contact.", "NTA. So basically you were 6, and expected to entertain and focus your attention on a 3 year old because of cancer??? Shit parents if you ask me. Of 5 kids, I had one who required multiple surgeries growing up, and one who was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer at one point (she is cancer free now) but I kept the kids lives as normal as I could in the circumstances. And never would I allow the sick ones to use that as an excuse for anything.", "Yes but verbally repeating the message calmly to the sister might help her become a better friend. While I understand OPs frustration if a few calm conversations can lead to improvement in the situation, then why not try?", "Can you imagine a coworker like that?", "No one is unable to change - we really need to stop with this idea that people are 'set in their ways' so you can't expect better of them.\n\nYou absolutely can and should expect better of people. They aren't unable to change, they are unwilling, and their unwillingness is a character flaw as change is an important part of growth. You should set limits and consequences for bad behaviour towards you or others so if they want to stay that way, fine, but they won't be rewarded for it or accommodated for choosing to behave badly.\n\nShe is not doomed forever to be this person. People can grow and change at any age. The issue is that she likely needs to come to the conclusion on her own or have it told to her by people she thinks highly of. Which might be years away, but it will likely happen if she goes to college or a university as people will call her out on her immaturity or roll their eyes as she expects them to cater to her and they refuse.", "yup and then they go on about wanting a relationship again because \"i gAVe bIrTH tO yOu\"", "So many fun projects to work on", "Nta. Your parents raised a monster.", "It sounds like your parent are loving the attention THEY get through her.  It's called Munchausen by Proxy (though they aren't *making* her sick to get attention).  Going up to the front of the church to announce her daughter was OK was not only unnecessary and ridiculous, it was an attention-seeking maneuver for your \\*mother\\*.\n\nYour sister is the \"breadwinner\" in the business of attention, and you were treated like a prop.  I'm sorry you went through that, and still would be if you maintained contact with them."]}
