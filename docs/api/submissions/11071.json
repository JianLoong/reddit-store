I hope this is a rental and not a purchase of a home with her. You are seeing her true colors now and how everything is going to have to be her way, while you pay for her to have a better lifestyle than she could afford on her own.   \nAsk her when the fancy homes photographer is coming by for the photo shoot for the home interiors magazine is stopping by. Until then you will live in YOUR home as you see fit and DO what YOU want to do in your own home whether she approves or not. She is not your mommy who can tell you to put your \u201ctoys\u201d away.

It's financially abusive. \n\n\"I pay more so I get more,\" is an attitude that is diametrically opposed to \"I want to be equals.\" In one fell swoop you have told her exactly how you really feel about just how much power and security she's allowed to have in this relationship: precisely as much as you are willing to let her have. If Mia suddenly started earning 900% of your salary would you be okay with her paying 90% and then throwing it in your face every fight?\n\nYou clearly don't think this is an equal relationship at all. Don't try to tell yourself otherwise. \n\nYou need to sit down and take a good, long self inventory of your own values, wants, needs and attitudes. You need to actually be honest with yourself when you do it. \n\nThen you need to look at Mia and figure out if she holds the same values you do (by communicating calmly) and decide if this relationship will work.\n\nBecause right now, I've gotta say, I don't think your financial values match. Or some of your other values. If you really want to keep her, you desperately need couple's counseling.\n\nMoreover I would recommend you *not* get into a relationship with anyone if your attitude about money really is that \"I pay more, I deserve more\" instead of \"we are equals together regardless of monetary contributions.\"\n\nDating someone in your financial bracket sounds like a great idea, buy life happens. People lose jobs. People get promotions. Say you find someone with the same salary as you. Say she gets fired a year after you get married and her new job has half the salary. Will you start to resent her?\n\nI wouldn't date anyone seriously enough to move in with them, commingle finances or marry them if the attitude you've presented here are your real feelings. It wouldn't be fair to them.", "NAH\n\nThis seems like baseline incompatibility more than anyone really being an asshole. \n\nMy spouse and I are actually in a remarkably similar situation from a purely technical point of view. He makes way more money than I do, contributes far more to bills, has a ton a legos, and I'm not super into legos. \n\nThe money thing was agreed upon before we went forward with our relationship. A proportional split seemed fair to us and doesn't cause resentment. \n\nFor the legos we spent time figuring out which ones I liked too and how to display them well. For example I enjoy modulars on bookshelves especially when surrounded by books. All the flower legos make me happy cause I kill normal plants. But stuff like cars, or Fandom (zero dawn, marvel, lord of the rings, star wars) goes in his office. \n\nBasically I would try to not focus on the specifics on why you guys are arguing this particular time and maybe ask yourself if there are larger reasons that have led you to all the \"smaller\" arguments.

Which is that your hobbies should be able to have space in your home. My husband loves legos, models, and anything he can put together.

If my husband made those points to me, I would not have perceived it as an attack on my job or on the fact that I pay less in bills. \n\nAnd honestly - you\u2019re right, she was being childish.

He literally is saying that because he pays more, she is getting benefits that he isn't getting.", "I mean with what she\u2019s demanding of control of the apartment, yes she better be paying her fair share", "I think it's cute. She worries a lot about \"what people think\".", "Cool", "Where is her compromise? Sounds like it's only him .", "There is no compromise if someone raises a point and is countered with \u201cdo you not love me?\u201d", "He threw it in her face because she is telling the person who is the only reason she can afford the place what he can do in said place lol", "This is where you lost me.  Relationships are about compromise, but it's not a compromise when only one person is doing all the giving and the other is doing all the taking.  This situation is absolutely not them compromising, it's him caving to her and getting nothing back.  Where do you see her compromising at all?  He pays the majority of the bills, they live where she wants to live, he doesn't get to contribute to the decisions regarding the home decor and now he's not allowed to have legos?", "i still dont find him an AH for that. he\u2019s her wallet that gets emotionally blackmailed by her an her friends. apartments he doesn\u2019t want everybody just accuses him of not loving his partner. decor he dows want childish and embarrassing. he really doesn\u2019t get anything besides being talked down to and name called", "I disagree. I feel it\u2019s just further context to show his opinion not being valued.", "I think what they are trying to say is in general...people shouldn't use financial contributions, to get their way in a relationship.\nIt can easily start becoming manipulative, IF that mindset gets out of hand it could be seen as \"financial abuse\"\n\nThat there are more mature ways to set boundries and working things out. \n\nHe could have just pointed out that it was his home too, so he should get some input on decor. He could have said something along the had the right to feel comfortable in his own home and decorate it to fit his lifestyle etc.", "It's already been established that him wanting more say over how the home runs is not part of him being an AH...

He's reasonable in wanting a say over what is on display but an asshole because he expressed that want by holding his greater earning power over her head.", "\u201cBut as I have voiced to Mia, I feel that she gets the benefit of the big expenses while paying a much smaller amount whereas I don\u2019t get anything.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s a quote from OP. Their argument is not about making major financial decisions. He\u2019s mad that he pays more than her, while she doesn\u2019t suffer any consequence and gets to live and \u201cbenefit\u201d from the same accommodations. He\u2019s also she decorated the majority of the apartment and she doesn\u2019t want his toys in display. That\u2019s *normal.* Women like to decorate, generally speaking. Men don\u2019t like to decorate, generally speaking. I play guitar and have other hobbies, but my guitars and skateboards are not displayed for everyone to see. I don\u2019t live in a frat house, I live in a well decorated home that my wife had a major role in doing. I have my music room in my basement. And I have my skateboard, fishing, snowboarding stuff in the garage. It sounds to me that OP is having a hard time understanding that living together requires a little more growing up than he is ready to do.", "I understand the sentiment, but don\u2019t fully agree in this situation. This isn\u2019t an abusive situation where he\u2019s paying 70% of the bills and is demanding 70% of the decision making power. He\u2019s saying he pays 70% of the bills and she won\u2019t even *allow* him to have 50% of the decision making power.", "OP isn\u2019t leveraging his pay to get 100% control tho, he\u2019s leveraging his pay to even get a say in the situation.", "Absolutely is okay when those two issues are linked", "Yeah, read the same quote. Also read the context. And yes, it is about making major financial choices because it was about their HOME.\nAnd do not come here with some sexist nonsense about how \u201cwomen like to decorate and men don\u2019t.\u201d The entire phenomenon of \u201cman caves\u201d is that we bypass any sense of shared living spaces and went to compartmentalizing lives. Man caves absolutely prove that men do like to decorate.\nOP was shut down by Mia\u2019s decorating decisions. That isn\u2019t healthy either.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you feel that your hobbies need to be relegated to the garage. Or that skateboards are too \u201cfrat house\u201d for you and your wife.\n\nOP is mad that he\u2019s being shut down and not allowed an equal say in the home when he was already on board with shared finances and proportional costs. \u201cGrowing up\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a silly door mat, or hiding your Lego builds.", "They\u2019re not linked", "Lmao, yes my skateboards and fishing poles go in the garage because that\u2019s where they belong. If it rolls on pavement, or touches fish, it stays in the garage. Just like a bicycle. If you like to ride your bike, do you need to display in inside your home? Or does it just get left in the garage like a normal human? You sound ridiculous and do not sound like someone who is grown or in a stable relationship tbh. \n\nAnd I said \u201cgenerally speaking\u201d cuz I knew you\u2019d get all woke on me. Yes I\u2019m sorry, but women *generally* like to decorate more than men do. Prove me wrong, go stand at the front door of Homegoods and count men vs women walking in the door. It\u2019s not sexist, it\u2019s just like saying more men work as carpenters or plumbers than women. It\u2019s a general statement that is regarded as true. Don\u2019t hate. \n\nAnd if you consider a petty argument about displaying Legos to be a major financial decision regarding their home, I don\u2019t know what else I can say to you.", "yeah, gotta agree to disagree", "They sure are! Nothing here is a single issue! It\u2019s all interconnected.", "If you read this post and think I\u2019m the context of this post they aren\u2019t. You should go back to elementary school cause you have the reading level of a child.", "How \u201cwoke\u201d of me to want partners to actually partner. How small of you to see the Lego argument as being a singular issue and not clearly part of a larger pattern of issues in their relationship with Mia denying OP ownership of their home."]}
