I hope this is a rental and not a purchase of a home with her. You are seeing her true colors now and how everything is going to have to be her way, while you pay for her to have a better lifestyle than she could afford on her own.   \nAsk her when the fancy homes photographer is coming by for the photo shoot for the home interiors magazine is stopping by. Until then you will live in YOUR home as you see fit and DO what YOU want to do in your own home whether she approves or not. She is not your mommy who can tell you to put your \u201ctoys\u201d away.
