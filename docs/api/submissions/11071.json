I hope this is a rental and not a purchase of a home with her. You are seeing her true colors now and how everything is going to have to be her way, while you pay for her to have a better lifestyle than she could afford on her own.   \nAsk her when the fancy homes photographer is coming by for the photo shoot for the home interiors magazine is stopping by. Until then you will live in YOUR home as you see fit and DO what YOU want to do in your own home whether she approves or not. She is not your mommy who can tell you to put your \u201ctoys\u201d away.

It doesn't matter what the revenue split looks like. As long as both sides are contributing what was agreed on then that aspect of the relationship goes into the closet and never gets brought up again unless it's relevant. \n\n\"I live here too, so I should get to have a say in how we decorate,\" is fine. \n\n\"I pay more than you so I get to have more say, \nand so I get to be the one who stays when we have a fight,\" is not ok. It's financially abusive. \n\n\"I pay more so I get more,\" is an attitude that is diametrically opposed to \"I want to be equals.\" In one fell swoop you have told her exactly how you really feel about just how much power and security she's allowed to have in this relationship: precisely as much as you are willing to let her have. If Mia suddenly started earning 900% of your salary would you be okay with her paying 90% and then throwing it in your face every fight?\n\nYou clearly don't think this is an equal relationship at all. Don't try to tell yourself otherwise. \n\nYou need to sit down and take a good, long self inventory of your own values, wants, needs and attitudes. You need to actually be honest with yourself when you do it. \n\nThen you need to look at Mia and figure out if she holds the same values you do (by communicating calmly) and decide if this relationship will work.\n\nBecause right now, I've gotta say, I don't think your financial values match. Or some of your other values. If you really want to keep her, you desperately need couple's counseling.\n\nMoreover I would recommend you *not* get into a relationship with anyone if your attitude about money really is that \"I pay more, I deserve more\" instead of \"we are equals together regardless of monetary contributions.\"\n\nDating someone in your financial bracket sounds like a great idea, buy life happens. People lose jobs. People get promotions. Say you find someone with the same salary as you. Say she gets fired a year after you get married and her new job has half the salary. Will you start to resent her?\n\nI wouldn't date anyone seriously enough to move in with them, commingle finances or marry them if the attitude you've presented here are your real feelings. It wouldn't be fair to them.", "NAH\n\nThis seems like baseline incompatibility more than anyone really being an asshole. \n\nMy spouse and I are actually in a remarkably similar situation from a purely technical point of view. He makes way more money than I do, contributes far more to bills, has a ton a legos, and I'm not super into legos. \n\nThe money thing was agreed upon before we went forward with our relationship. A proportional split seemed fair to us and doesn't cause resentment. \n\nFor the legos we spent time figuring out which ones I liked too and how to display them well. For example I enjoy modulars on bookshelves especially when surrounded by books. All the flower legos make me happy cause I kill normal plants. But stuff like cars, or Fandom (zero dawn, marvel, lord of the rings, star wars) goes in his office. \n\nBasically I would try to not focus on the specifics on why you guys are arguing this particular time and maybe ask yourself if there are larger reasons that have led you to all the \"smaller\" arguments.

Which is that your hobbies should be able to have space in your home. My husband loves legos, models, and anything he can put together.

If my husband made those points to me, I would not have perceived it as an attack on my job or on the fact that I pay less in bills. \n\nAnd honestly - you\u2019re right, she was being childish.
