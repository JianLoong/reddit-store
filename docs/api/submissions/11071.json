I voiced this concern to her and a few friends and it was shutdown as \u201cdo you not love me/her?\u201d I relented and just accepted that I was wrong.\n\nMia came home from lunch recently and I was building a Lego set (Zero Dawn) and she said she needed the table and to take my \u201cchildren\u2019s toy\u201d somewhere else. I told her I was almost done anyway and her remark wasn\u2019t needed. I put the finished set on a shelf and maybe five minutes later she started telling me to move it because it didn\u2019t belong there. She said this was a place for adults and having a Lego figure out would be embarrassing. \n\nI told Mia that I am an adult and if I find joy in these things then that\u2019s my prerogative, and she already decorated 80% of the house that I pay the majority for, and that no the figure would not be moved or relocated, and it\u2019s a shame she looks down on things that make me happy because she thinks they are for kids. I told her, that most of her conversations with me and other people revolve around funny conversations she has with preteens at work, so maybe I wasn\u2019t the only person under the roof that is childish. \n\nMia was both upset and mad. She said I was throwing up the fact that I made more in her face and demeaning her job. She started crying and asked me to leave. I told her that she should be the one to leave if she wants someone to go, and I was not demeaning her job as I know it\u2019s important, but I wanted some changes in the home. I want to be treated equal if this was going to work out and having a say how things look was a small compromise having some of my toys from storage wasn\u2019t a big deal. \n\nShe ended up leaving and taking a few days off work. She said she needed to think about the relationship. To be honest I agree, and I think we may need to say thank you but goodbye.

I hope this is a rental and not a purchase of a home with her. You are seeing her true colors now and how everything is going to have to be her way, while you pay for her to have a better lifestyle than she could afford on her own.   \nAsk her when the fancy homes photographer is coming by for the photo shoot for the home interiors magazine is stopping by. Until then you will live in YOUR home as you see fit and DO what YOU want to do in your own home whether she approves or not. She is not your mommy who can tell you to put your \u201ctoys\u201d away.

Not sure how you reached for the control aspect when OP has 0 say in the apartment lol.", "Is it tho? Im a 100 percent happy to pay all the bills every time my partner is not doing well financially. Its a give and take. Once you start keeping score is when you know it\u2019s really doomed", "Her disagreeing with you is not the same as you having \u201cpretty much zero say\u201d", "What was the doormat?", "I think the ESH is fair.\n\nThe issue isn't that he pays 80% and gets no say, the issue is he gets no say. Him paying 80% is irrelevant.", "Yeah. We have other bills that are also split, but she has a student loan (I do not) which also is pretty pricy.", "It\u2019s not about the money- you\u2019ve missed the point. The score keeping here is about who has the rights to the space, and Mia is telling OP he doesn\u2019t have the right to his own space", "I had to remove a lot from my submission due to word count. I have basically no say in decoration.", "Just a doormat that said \"wipe your paws.\" We have indoor cat so she said she thought people would think we were dog people.", "Sounds like a conversation to have with her that doesn\u2019t involve flaunting your money", "I've had the conversation before wihtou bringing money up. She's convinced that people have standards while I think we should do what makes us happy in our home. I only brought the money up because I have next to zero say.", "It sounds like you want to do what makes *you* happy. She wants to do what makes *her* happy. That\u2019s a compatibility issue, and neither of you are handling it well.", "Theres a difference for asking for one thing and controlling the whole apartment. Most people will have a compatibility issue when their partner needs to control every decoration lmao.", "Yeah but the difference is that OP isn't the one outright refusing compromise. OP is NTA."]}
