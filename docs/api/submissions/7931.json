If there is an actual issue, then you address it in full detail.

That's why she hung up.", "The mom who called was rude. She gave no indication that the daughter is even complaining, only that he's there. So for all we know the daughter has zero issue, and the mom just doesn't want her daughter around boys in a house. The mom explained nothing, called OP a bitch, and difficult. Who's going out of their way for someone after that? Certainly not me. The little girl needs to stay home, especially until her mother learns how to communicate like an adult. OP says that they aren't in bedrooms. They are out in main living areas, so unless she's hiding in her room, she'd be able to hear and see anything happening that's egregious. If it's subtle stuff, then everyone is going to have to learn to use their words, or stay home. This boy shouldn't be vilified for existing in his own home.", "Yes, yes the phone call was rude. You know what? Many adults have just about as good communication skills as their kids. Yes, the other mom is out of line. Yes, the other mom seemed to not mention enough things. So, OP should push back. What she is saying is extreme and it clearly stems from something that OP should find out more on.

And that\u2019s not helping the situation.", "Are we assuming that this is the only friend that is over and that the boy isn't in school? I think OP could pay more attention when kids are visiting just to be sure that her son's behavior is above board... But also he can't be responsible because his existence makes other's uncomfortable, especially in his home. OP should have some sort of idea of what her son is like. If OP had said the parent called and claimed <insert any behavior> and I told her then keep her child home and hung up... Then absolutely she should be looking into it, having convos with her daughter and would be the asshole, etc. But this little girl knows the brother lives there, and she seemingly wants to return.

She was trying to convince my dad to talk to the friend's mom, to never allow him to come to our house again, etc. I was mortified. Fortunately my dad was well aware of how histrionic my grandmother could be and believed me when I said it was nothing like that at all.

Thank you for the heads up!\"\n\nAnd then don't tell the son about it, just stealthily pay attention the next few times the daughter's friends are over, and if he's being creepy, deal with it. If it's merely social awkwardness (or intentionally being a nuisance to his sister) educate him. But if nothing seems wrong, it's likely the girl is just being overly dramatic, e.g. \"boys are disgusting!\", or the mom misinterpreted her daughter's comment.\n\nDepriving your daughter of a friend without doing due dilligence is as much of a YTA move as it would've been to lock your son in his room without due dilligence.\n\nWithout due dilligence, you're giving off massive \"My precious snookum would never hurt a fly!\" vibes, said by every mother of every son who ever did anything wrong.", "I was thinking the same thing.", "The way OP expressed it, it seems like the mom is the one with the issue. I mean, it could just be Alice talks about interacting with the son, or when she is visiting OP's daughter they talk to the brother or watch a movie together, or who the hell knows what innocent activity.", "Or, Alice has a crush on the son, and Alice's mom doesn't like it.  \n\nThe word creepy has me wondering if that was an exact quote or not - and if so, then who was quoted (Alice or Alice's mom).", "This was my thought. Maybe Alice talking about the brother a lot.", "That was what I thought as well.  \n\nOverprotective mom realizing that Alice talks about the son a lot or Alice seems obsesses with the son due to a crush.", "misandrist", "When I was that age I spent a lot of time around my best friend's older brothers (3-5 years older than her). They were good and caring older brothers, and treated me like I was also their little sister! I had a crush on her closest age brother, but he always kept us at arm's length because we were a bit younger. Yelling at us to go to her room and watch a movie there so he could play the game system in the living room or rolling his eyes when we were allowed to watch a movie on the living room TV. Teenagers can be predators, but boys existing in the same home as girls isn't necessarily a problem (and if it was...what do we do about opposite gender siblings?).\n\nIt sounds like the parent(s) here is around for all these interactions (and that is important information that should be communicated). If Alice's parents are still uncomfortable even though adults have eyes on them almost all the time, then Alice's parents can not let their kid come over anymore. Brother lives in the home and should be allowed to exist normally, no matter who else is in the house!", "Younger siblings can be very annoying to the older ones though, especially if the older one has friends over and doesn't pay attention to the younger siblings. I have two kids and can confirm.\n\nBut the siblings live there and have the same rights. So it depends on the situation. I would sometimes occupy the younger one with a nice activity so she didn't feel left out of the fun, at other times told the older ones to stop complaining.", "I know none of this is your daughter's fault and she doesn't deserve to lose a friend over it but I would honestly advise against letting your daughter go hang out at the house of a person with a mentality like the friend's mother. That mother has already taught her own daughter to find it \"creepy\" when a little boy hangs around his own home, who knows what she could teach your daughter or convince your daughter of (imagine getting a visit from CPS because that woman convinced your 11 year old that she's being abused or something similar).\n\nUnless your son only hangs around the common areas a lot when the other girl is around and it's not what he usually does even when she's not around, I'd be concerned about having your daughter exposed to her friend's mother.", "Don't think I said that at all. I said she should ask follow up questions about why this girl doesn't want him around. She could be being difficult and mean. He could think it's hilarious to snap her bra straps. I don't know and neither does op. And let's not turn this into he's an innocent bystander or a creep. There is a world of gray in the middle of those where kids make mistakes and need to learn.", "I wouldn't bring the husband into this. I would turn it onto the woman herself. \n\n\"I am not  going to let my daughter go over to the house of someone who sexualizes children.\"", "Alice said that the son is around a lot. That could have just been a complete neutral statement of fact. Maybe she even likes that he is around a lot. We really don't know if Alice has a problem with the son. It could really be just a case of a totally paranoid mother.", "It could be Alice's mother asked, so who was there, and Alice said OPs daughter, another 2 friends from school, Alice's mother and her brother mentioned in passing, Alice's mother could have said, oh is OPs brother a little brother, no, a big brother, how big, dunno, a teenager. Then Alice's mother could have grilled her on how often he was there, not for a single moment caring about the fact he lives there and Alice doesn't, so she then made the implication that it's creepy to the OP.", "OP didn't explicitly say *Alice* said the son was a creep. The mom \"found it creepy\". I think it's possible Alice has a little crush and talked about the son in a way her mom doesn't like, because she thinks Alice is too young to like a boy.", "There are different standards for politicians / rich people and normal guys.", "Good word!", "I mean to be fair if you're sharing a house you get alone time by leaving or going to your own room. OP's daughter and her friends don't get to just \"ask for alone time\" and expect her brother to go to his room.", "I agree. NTA.", "Or Alice could have a crush and mom found out and doesn't like that her daughter likes a boy and thinks son is doing something to encourage it.", "But it's okay to assume this young girl is going to make false accusations based on... her talking to her mom about something that potentially made her uncomfortable? It's not Alice's fault that her mom overreacted, and it's feeding into stereotypes just as much to jump from that to \"she's going to make false accusations!!\"", ">If the mother of an 11yr old little girl came to me and said that my 14yr old son was behaving inappropriately and making her uncomfortable\n\nBut the mother didn't say anything like that. She only said Alice told her the son is around a lot. I would assume that if Alice told her the son acts badly, that the mother would have mentioned that to OP. Ideally with examples Alice would have mentioned after her mother asked for them.\n\nSo to me it just sounds more like paranoid mother in this case.", "To be fair, I'm not sure why anyone assumes that she would get to do that. I asked if her child had asked OP to aid them in privacy from said brother for info. OP answered and the conversation left that side of things pretty much immediately save two discord trolls stuck on the word \"call\" lol.", "Also possible . . . ugh, that would be so embarrassing for Alice.", "I am not assuming anything, but I would expect Alice's Mom to explain why OP's son's presence bothers Alice if she goes as far as demanding him not being around in his own home when Alice visits. Initiating that conversation is on her, not on OP.\n\nIf she can't be bothered to do that, I would assume that she has no basis for this demand other than not liking OP's son. And that is not a person OP should allow in her home.", "I will grant that I think Alice\u2019s mother could have approached the OP in a way that was more sensitive and less accusatory.  Though I\u2019m not sure that any approach would make the OP more open to the possibility of her son doing anything wrong - even in innocence.  I also recognize that 11yr olds are not necessarily articulate about these situations.  So her mother might not have concrete examples of what\u2019s happened to alarm her.  Yet alarm there certainly is.  A conversation with the lad would determine whether that alarm is justified or not.", "And that is the last time Alice tells mom about liking a boy... forever.", "Even though this is all anonymous, I think we should all be very careful to avoid sinking into the \"there must be *something* wrong\" mentality, which can lead to false insinuations.\n\nPlus, if a rational parent feared someone's son was a predator, the reasonable reaction would not to be ask the boy's mother to keep the son a little more isolated while the parent's daughter hung out at their house. The reasonable reaction would be to not let the daughter go over there.", "This isn't an answer. It needs to be checked with the daughter and Alice.", "Even an irrational parent would usually stop a child going somewhere they believed was unsafe (or try to at least). \n\nMy mum would go into random fits of accusing random friends of ours or their families into being predators, cult members or serial killers and trying to forbid us or our dad (who had primary custody) to let us hang out/see them anymore. \n\nShe never had any reasoning behind this behaviour beyond \u201cI saw it on the news!\u201d."]}
