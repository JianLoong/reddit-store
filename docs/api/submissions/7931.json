It wasn't funny. It's not funny to me to hear someone say they need a shot gun for my six year old who was minding his own business because he's male, and I'm so sick of hearing people say men don't need defending, there is no such as as misandry, etc. If Alice has a problem with your son, she doesn't belong in your house, and your daughter doesn't need friends who think her brother is creepy for living (and Alice sounds problematic, like the type to accuse him of something because she doesn't like him, and you already know she's badmouthing your son and implying things about him).\n\nNTA and I'd bar Alice from coming over.

Does he bother you? Does he go into his room, or try to talk to you?\" and may be leading her daughter's thoughts.

Her mother is the kind of woman who would have had all her daughter's friends burned as witches in old Salem if they disagreed with her.", "WTF are you talking about? It's not an issue of either autonomy or privacy. Nobody has even suggested that if daughter is in her room with her friend, brother barges in. Nobody has even suggested that she can't have privacy with her.

You need to apologise to qwibbian.", "You didn't do anything. You gave a suggestion, and I just gave one on why this isn't OPs issue. I just think the idea that a boy breathing in his own home is making someone else uncomfortable is ridiculous. Now if he's actively bothering her, trying to get in on their girl time when asked not to, following them from room to room.... Those are all reasonable and easy things to address. However him having a snack in the kitchen when they are, or sitting in the living room watching the same show or vegging on the couch and she just wants alone time with her friend- not reasonable. And before the mom said anything to OP she should have gotten to the bottom or kept her home. Otherwise it all sounds entitled.", "I agree the other mom would\u2019ve been more appropriate to keep her daughter home and say why to OP. \n\nAs a parent whose kid\u2019s friends are open with me about stuff they probably shouldn\u2019t tell me, some kids don\u2019t talk as openly with their parents. And it\u2019s good to know what\u2019s happening in your home anyway, her son shouldn\u2019t be made to feel targeted/outcast either.", "I believe this is OPs issue because this is one of her daughters friends. It\u2019s only not OPs issue if her daughter is okay with losing a friend. The other mom is out of line, don\u2019t get me wrong. But if OPs daughter doesn\u2019t want to lose her friend, then it\u2019s on the adults to do the adult job of communicating. This was one uncomfortable phone call, it\u2019s hardly a reason to hang up and wash her hands of this mom and her kid.", "Just going by what OP is telling us, you are totally right.  And let's hope that it is simple as Alice being entitled and her Mum turning it into a drama.\n\nBut if it's something that can be easily addressed such as DS following them from room to room when he doesn't need to or him saying odd things to the girls, the OP may not be aware of this, especially if her DD hasn't said anything.  Someone else mentioned for OP to chat to DD, which I think is a great start.  And then possibly have another discussion with Alice's Mum for more detailed specifics.  \n\nIn the meantime, Alice shouldn't be going around on the basis that it's her problem and not OPs.  If it comes back that that DS has in fact done something, only then should it be dealt with.", "The other parent indicated nothing. Not one thing. She had plenty of opportunity between the start of the convo to the end to make a case for something worth discussing. She did not. The entitlement some folks have is really baffling to me sometimes. You don't call someone else and tell them to put their son away... I mean it would be off with your head if it was a dog in these reddit streets. If there is an actual issue, then you address it in full detail. OP doesn't only have to worry about her daughters friendships, who can still be a friend without going to each other's house, but her son's feelings. The phone call wasn't uncomfortable, it was rude. That's why she hung up.", "The mom who called was rude. She gave no indication that the daughter is even complaining, only that he's there. So for all we know the daughter has zero issue, and the mom just doesn't want her daughter around boys in a house. The mom explained nothing, called OP a bitch, and difficult. Who's going out of their way for someone after that? Certainly not me. The little girl needs to stay home, especially until her mother learns how to communicate like an adult. OP says that they aren't in bedrooms. They are out in main living areas, so unless she's hiding in her room, she'd be able to hear and see anything happening that's egregious. If it's subtle stuff, then everyone is going to have to learn to use their words, or stay home. This boy shouldn't be vilified for existing in his own home.", "Yes, yes the phone call was rude. You know what? Many adults have just about as good communication skills as their kids. Yes, the other mom is out of line. Yes, the other mom seemed to not mention enough things. So, OP should push back. What she is saying is extreme and it clearly stems from something that OP should find out more on. It\u2019s stupid of anyone to think OP shouldn\u2019t do more to find out why a mom feels her son is creepy. Because all anyone in this thread is doing is speculating. And that\u2019s not helping the situation.", "Are we assuming that this is the only friend that is over and that the boy isn't in school? I think OP could pay more attention when kids are visiting just to be sure that her son's behavior is above board... But also he can't be responsible because his existence makes other's uncomfortable, especially in his home. OP should have some sort of idea of what her son is like. If OP had said the parent called and claimed <insert any behavior> and I told her then keep her child home and hung up... Then absolutely she should be looking into it, having convos with her daughter and would be the asshole, etc. But this little girl knows the brother lives there, and she seemingly wants to return. Why would she want to do that if he was doing something that made her uncomfortable or upset her? It sounds like the mom has an issue to me."]}
