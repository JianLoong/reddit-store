Did Alice\u2019s mom say *why* she wanted this?  Is she alleging your son has been inappropriate with Alice?  Is this a religious thing about girls and boys keeping apart?  Does Alice have a crush that she wants to discourage?", "Wow this is certainly one of those stories I\u2019d repeat forever if it were me. Did you ever press this mom to explain what exactly is she worried about? And what specific behavior from your son she\u2019s flagging as \u201ccreepy\u201d? Sometimes it\u2019s fun to listen to ridiculousness. \n\nNTA btw.", "NTA. What an entitled **** to ask that your son not leave his room *in his own residence*.

Is he being creepy towards her? What's the /actual/ problem?", "NTA  that woman is a lunatic if she wants you to keep your own child who lives there away with her daughter visits. What world does she live in in?", "NTA, the audacity of this woman...", "NTA. Your primary job as a parent is to protect your children. Your son should not have to cloister because your daughter has a friend with issues. Further, who knows what Alice may try to blame your son for in the future. I don't think it's inappropriate to kick such a person out of the house. It's probably best to terminate that relationship.", "He's 14 and lives there.  If she doesn't like it....tough shit.

What does Alice\u2019s mom think you will do about your son being in the family home?\n\nNot exactly the same thing but it\u2019s the same concept.  Whenever people come to my house and want me to lock up my cats because they have issues with my cats, I tell them the same thing you did, just not as nicely.  \u201cThis is their house.  These cats are more welcome here than you are.\u201d", "I'm a parent of two boys, so take my advice with a grain of salt.\n\nIs your son behaving in any way that would make Alice unconformable, such as excessive staring?  Or maybe scratching himself excessively (we normally don't notice this as a parent but watching others do it, it's uncomfortable)? Not leaving the girls alone when friends are over?  Or anything else that can be considering strange?  Alice may not have a brother, so therefore not sure how to behave / react to your DS.\n\nI will vote NTA if he pays not attention to them and just doing what boys do.\n\nIf I had a parent come to me and ask the same question, with my two in mind, I too would tell her to bugger off and not invite Alice around again.  I'm just giving food for thought.\n\nEdited to add, if Alice is also 11, she maybe suffering from hormonal changes, not knowing how to handle it.  She maybe coming over while on her period and is embarrassed by it and not wanting your DS knowing about it.  Just throwing ideas out there.", "NTA.

Forbid that child from ever entering your house again.  You are so close to irreversible damage to your son\u2019s life.  You need to keep your son away from her like she is radioactive.

This woman is implying your son is a sexual predator without any foundation and has the audacity to enforce her delusional restrictions in your own home.

Maybe you can find more clarity on what happened if you know what she said? I am heavily leaning to NTA because based on the details we have it does sound like the only \"suspicious\" thing your son has done is be a guy. But you know how kids can be. Sometimes they say something that sounds \"off\" to an adult until we probe it a bit more. \n\nI will say this. When I was their age, having the 7th grade older brothers around made me feel safe. Plus we tended to have more fun!

That is ridiculous that she wants your son, who lives in the house to be restricted to his room while a guest gets to go wherever she wants, when your son has done nothing to warrant this. While it\u2019s good to teach her daughter to be cautious she is going way overboard and is teaching her to have major trust issues and Alice is going to be living her life in abject fear because of what her mother is doing.", "NTA.

This is both untrue and not a health thing for her daughter to learn  - if she wants her daughter to have healthy adult relationships. Yes, sadly, women need to learn self protection strategies in this world but this sort of fear of mean training is not ok.\n\nIf you can, it might not hurt to point this out to her.

If \"Alice\" wants him \"around less\" then \"Alice\" and daughter can go into daughter's room, period. She is being absolutely ridiculous to ask that you practically quarantine your son to his room while his sister has friends over, like wtf, as you said HE LIVES THERE.\n\nEdit*typo", "NTA.

That won't be a problem if Alice stays home.\n\nHonestly, I grew up across the street from a family who had a girl my age, and twin boys who were older. At a certain point, since all parents were at work until dinner time, my folks said I was no longer allowed to visit the house across the street.

Maybe the girls should hang out at the other girl's house or something if she is uncomfortable around the boy.", "NTA because it is your home and your son.\n\n At the same time, is Alice's mother being ridiculous or has Alice claimed your son is a creep? Regardless, as an adult, the mother should've been more specific if your son is being creepy and definitely not called you a bitch. You might want to check in with your kids on the chance there is something. I kinda doubt it. As a non-parent, if I thought a kid was being creepy, I would've told you and not allowed my kid at your home. However, I do think it's worthwhile to subtly ask on the off-chance.", "NTA Alice's mom is obviously living in her own little world of weird here.

That information could lead to VERY different answers.", "Then the parent should address those specific issues. She should say when my daughter was over yesterday she told me your son does xyz a lot and it has made her really uncomfortable.

They hang out in the living room or backyard, but it's too cold for the backyard right now. There's also no sleepovers or outfit changing.", "I agree that this is info OP should seek out, but the more I think about it, this is clearly NTA either way.\n\nIf this woman had any specific concerns she should have brought them up. If she is just vaguely suspicious due to something she heard or felt, then she needs to decide whether she needs to restrict her daughters access.

I loved my sibling with the same age gap, but plenty don't, so I feel like this is up to the sister more than anything.", "Alice may not have told her mother specifics - cause kids tend not to communicate with parents.

You can't go around accusing or assuming about another child in their own home. She asks her daughter for specifics or she stays home. The boy should be allowed to move around his home freely.

We're getting one side of the story here, and we can only judge by what OP is telling us.  \n\nAt 11, kids are hormonal and can't always tell what they really mean or they are embarrassed by their feelings.  If Alice can't elaborate to her mother, you are right, she shouldn't be going around.  And you are right, the son / brother shouldn't have to be locked up away whenever friends are over.  I'm just suggesting ideas as to why this maybe happening.  OP is here for advice / help.  I'm just trying to help - my bad, please excuse me for this."]}
