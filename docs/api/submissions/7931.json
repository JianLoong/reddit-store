It's not funny to me to hear someone say they need a shot gun for my six year old who was minding his own business because he's male, and I'm so sick of hearing people say men don't need defending, there is no such as as misandry, etc. If Alice has a problem with your son, she doesn't belong in your house, and your daughter doesn't need friends who think her brother is creepy for living (and Alice sounds problematic, like the type to accuse him of something because she doesn't like him, and you already know she's badmouthing your son and implying things about him).\n\nNTA and I'd bar Alice from coming over.

However him having a snack in the kitchen when they are, or sitting in the living room watching the same show or vegging on the couch and she just wants alone time with her friend- not reasonable.

Someone else mentioned for OP to chat to DD, which I think is a great start.  And then possibly have another discussion with Alice's Mum for more detailed specifics.  \n\nIn the meantime, Alice shouldn't be going around on the basis that it's her problem and not OPs.

If there is an actual issue, then you address it in full detail.

That's why she hung up.", "The mom who called was rude. She gave no indication that the daughter is even complaining, only that he's there. So for all we know the daughter has zero issue, and the mom just doesn't want her daughter around boys in a house. The mom explained nothing, called OP a bitch, and difficult. Who's going out of their way for someone after that? Certainly not me. The little girl needs to stay home, especially until her mother learns how to communicate like an adult. OP says that they aren't in bedrooms. They are out in main living areas, so unless she's hiding in her room, she'd be able to hear and see anything happening that's egregious. If it's subtle stuff, then everyone is going to have to learn to use their words, or stay home. This boy shouldn't be vilified for existing in his own home.", "Yes, yes the phone call was rude. You know what? Many adults have just about as good communication skills as their kids. Yes, the other mom is out of line. Yes, the other mom seemed to not mention enough things. So, OP should push back. What she is saying is extreme and it clearly stems from something that OP should find out more on. It\u2019s stupid of anyone to think OP shouldn\u2019t do more to find out why a mom feels her son is creepy. Because all anyone in this thread is doing is speculating. And that\u2019s not helping the situation.", "Are we assuming that this is the only friend that is over and that the boy isn't in school? I think OP could pay more attention when kids are visiting just to be sure that her son's behavior is above board... But also he can't be responsible because his existence makes other's uncomfortable, especially in his home. OP should have some sort of idea of what her son is like. If OP had said the parent called and claimed <insert any behavior> and I told her then keep her child home and hung up... Then absolutely she should be looking into it, having convos with her daughter and would be the asshole, etc. But this little girl knows the brother lives there, and she seemingly wants to return.

This woman would probably spit fire if you requested the same of her. \n\nYou may have already done so, but I do think that it would be best if you talked to your son about appropriate behavior around girls, just in general, because if he has done something creepy unintentionally, it can help him recognize it and avoid doing it again, and if he hasn't, it will help him avoid doing it in the first place.", "NTA it is your sons home.
