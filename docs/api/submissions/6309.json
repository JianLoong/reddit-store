Who the fuck cleans a toillet without the brush and cleaner?", "NTA this fight is insane. If you left waste onrthe seat, floor, or anywhere outside the toilet absolutely clean it up. But it is not 'common curtesy' to call down to the front desk for a toilet brush or use wadded toilet paper. Its above and beyond in paranoid ways, and Id talk to your wife about why she is so concerned about housekeeping knowing you poop. I really do not understand the perspective of any Y T A vote here.

First of all, housekeepers have seen FAR worse than that. WAAAAY worse. Second of all, there is absolutely zero expectation for the guest to clean the toilet in this situation - it's part of the job and a housekeeper would not give it a second though.\n\nThirdly, why is your wife so concerned about \"what the housekeeper thinks of her\"?

Trust me shit stains IN A TOILET not even Top 100 of the grossest or weirdest thing the average housekeeper has dealt with. Tell your wife to relax it\u2019s part of staying at a hotel, you get your room serviced. Now don\u2019t be a dick and shit on the bed or anything but a dirty toilet is no big deal.  You should always tip your housekeepers but if you feel extra bad leave some extra cash in the room on checkout.", "NTA - this isnt an airbnb, its a hotel.

Sure, it would be better to not leave a smear of poo, but you don't have a ton of control over it, and you shouldn't be demonized for that.\n\nAs someone who worked in a hotel and had to clean up several smears of fear, you're being wrongfully dragged over the coals in these comments and your wife (who I'm sure is a terrific person) may be a little neurotic.", "NTA\n\nWhy the hell would someone clean the toilet without a toilet brush or toilet cleaner. If the hotel provided you with a brush then okay that's fine, but without the brush then you're shit out of luck.\n\nLet's make it easier for others to understand. If the toilet was clogged and you didn't have a toilet plunger in the room, the reasonable thing is to call maintenance or someone in staff so it can be solved or so they can provide you with one.\n\nBut apparently what OP's wife is suggesting is shed just shove her arm down there and yank the clog out?\n\nWithout the proper tools it's not your responsibility to handle it. If the hotel provides you with a toilet brush and/or plunger then it's ASSUMED you'll handle these situations yourself. But otherwise it is something they are EXPECTED to take care of because it could also be a rule for safety or something else.

Come on...", "ESH, you for not guessing how gross it would be for others, and your wife (slightly) for not telling you the first or second time, instead cleaning up for you.

They have brushes and cleaner for that reason. Is it embarrassing absolutely and I feel for your wife. NTA, but you should apologize to your wife as it bothered her and not you. Her feeling are more important.", "NTA - My family managed a small motel/RV park when I was growing up, and I cleaned rooms when I was a teenager.\n\nI would think absolutely nothing of cleaning a poop stain off the inside of a toilet bowl.\n\nPoop on the walls...I'd be judging.\n\nBut seriously, a skid mark isn't even in the top 1000 of gross things I've seen in a motel room I cleaned.", "Wth kinds of resorts are you guys staying in?!? NTA", "NTA but your wife is gross", "If there is no brush, NTA.", "NTA.\n\n\n\nAnd.... Your wife is gross. Yuck.", "NTA", "NTA ... Smears happen; you can't always prevent them; you managed not to clog the toilet and there was no brush to clean it yourself.... That's what housekeeping is for.... Your wife CHOSE to clean it herself", "What? YTA. Was there no toilet paper to clean it with? How could you just leave it?", "She used toilet paper to clean it up.", "WTH kind of resort is this?!?!", "You can do this as the toilet is flushing or refilling and its not actually gross. Lol. Occasional dinosaur pooper as we are calling it now. I use this technique. Its not any more gross than wiping your ass with bare hands really (using TP of course) and its the same proximity to the dinosaur gift.", "He actually left it for the housekeeper. You know, the person who\u2019s job it is to clean", "We need to conserve water not waste it on shit that will disappear after a few other uses", "I\u2019ve been in fancy hotels to motels, in my country and others and I\u2019ve never seen a toilet brush in any of them.", "Where did you read he \"destroyed the toilet\"? You're going against the flow because your flow doesn't exist. Also what event?\n\nIt was a mark left *inside* the toilet bowl, probably below the waterline. Housekeeping has the tools to deal with that, and it's a 2 second job with a brush. Like I'm sure all the hotel staff are gonna keep a list of the guests that left a little stain inside the toilet and ban them from staying there again.", "Because they intend for only housekeeping to do that. It would look bad on a 5* hotel to have their guests scrubbing their own toilets. NAH. Clean up after yourself at home, OP.", "Exactly. The hand goes into poop water. And since theres no performativity / visible \"embarassment\" factor, doenst get washed properly. \ud83d\ude2c", "You don't put your hands in any water, obviously.", "The housekeepers will be happy it was contained to the toilet, having seen far far worse.", "Yep. There is so much worse. Like the guy who hid his tip inside the sheets he peed on \ud83d\ude11", "Exactly", "Please reread my comment. I didn\u2019t say he destroyed the toilet. I said /if/ he destroyed the toilet.  The post doesn\u2019t clarify whether it was \u201ca little stain\u201d or how bad it was. He first called it a dinosaur poop which implies it was bad. But the comment \u201csmear of fear\u201d downplays it. So, what I\u2019m saying is that if it was gross, he should have cleaned it himself."]}
