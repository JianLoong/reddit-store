Who the fuck cleans a toillet without the brush and cleaner?", "NTA this fight is insane. If you left waste onrthe seat, floor, or anywhere outside the toilet absolutely clean it up. But it is not 'common curtesy' to call down to the front desk for a toilet brush or use wadded toilet paper. Its above and beyond in paranoid ways, and Id talk to your wife about why she is so concerned about housekeeping knowing you poop. I really do not understand the perspective of any Y T A vote here.

First of all, housekeepers have seen FAR worse than that. WAAAAY worse. Second of all, there is absolutely zero expectation for the guest to clean the toilet in this situation - it's part of the job and a housekeeper would not give it a second though.\n\nThirdly, why is your wife so concerned about \"what the housekeeper thinks of her\"? Trust me, they don't give you or your wife a second thought, especially for something so ridiculously minor.", "NTA at all. Don\u2019t listen to these people saying YTA.

Trust me shit stains IN A TOILET not even Top 100 of the grossest or weirdest thing the average housekeeper has dealt with. Tell your wife to relax it\u2019s part of staying at a hotel, you get your room serviced. Now don\u2019t be a dick and shit on the bed or anything but a dirty toilet is no big deal.  You should always tip your housekeepers but if you feel extra bad leave some extra cash in the room on checkout.", "NTA - this isnt an airbnb, its a hotel.

Sure, it would be better to not leave a smear of poo, but you don't have a ton of control over it, and you shouldn't be demonized for that.\n\nAs someone who worked in a hotel and had to clean up several smears of fear, you're being wrongfully dragged over the coals in these comments and your wife (who I'm sure is a terrific person) may be a little neurotic.", "NTA\n\nWhy the hell would someone clean the toilet without a toilet brush or toilet cleaner. If the hotel provided you with a brush then okay that's fine, but without the brush then you're shit out of luck.\n\nLet's make it easier for others to understand. If the toilet was clogged and you didn't have a toilet plunger in the room, the reasonable thing is to call maintenance or someone in staff so it can be solved or so they can provide you with one.\n\nBut apparently what OP's wife is suggesting is shed just shove her arm down there and yank the clog out?\n\nWithout the proper tools it's not your responsibility to handle it. If the hotel provides you with a toilet brush and/or plunger then it's ASSUMED you'll handle these situations yourself. But otherwise it is something they are EXPECTED to take care of because it could also be a rule for safety or something else.

Come on...", "ESH, you for not guessing how gross it would be for others, and your wife (slightly) for not telling you the first or second time, instead cleaning up for you.
