They get to own the consequences, not you.\n\nFor safety's sake, don't tell anyone that you had a part in it until long after the neighbours are gone.", "Nta. Their behaviour is not on you.

This couldn't have been the first infraction.", "NTA - It is just as much your right to stay in a place that feels safe and secure as anyone else's. If you're living in a shared accommodation area, it's important to remember to respect everyone on the property. It's better that you've given information now rather than after a serious offense and ultimately it's the rental agencies decision to take action.", "NTA. They got it coming for them.

Many years ago, I got my drug dealer neighbor evicted.  Ironically, not because he was dealing drugs.  He locked me out of my apartment (shared hallway leading to our apartments) at 3AM one day and refused to open the door.  As this was before cell phones and I had no way to contact the landlord, I destroyed the door.  Later, I called the landlord to explain why I destroyed the door.  By the end of that day, the door was repaired and the drug dealer was gone.", "Hm...be careful, these people are dangerous. NTA but your safety is in danger.", "Whew, NTA. Things could have escalated. Nothing wrong with protecting your home. It\u2019s their bad behavior that led to this.", "NTA.

You kept your head down and got out.", "NTA - You're not a great person either though...it should bother you when people are dealing in stolen goods, every stolen items represents someone else's labor that was stolen from them by your neighbors and their accomplices. \n\nYour neighbors needed to be kicked out, they were destroying the property and making it less safe for everyone. It's not that hard for them to not vandalize where they live. They chose to do this. Their eviction is 100% the result of their choice to trash the apartment. It's not even like they let it get messy, they were outright smashing and ripping things up. They spent effort on ruining the place.\n\nWhy are you even wasting your emotional energy on worrying about this?

They got themselves evicted with their own behavior, not you.

That\u2019s a big lesson they have to learn: if they have something to hide, they have to make sure the neighbors don\u2019t get bothered, elsewise landlords or authorities will start to ask questions or going to look what\u2019s on. They snitched themselves.\n\nBut please for your own safety DO NOT tell anyone you\u2019re going to move.

Your neighbours are responsible as to how they behave and treat (or mistreat) their rented property. They\u2019re solely responsible for getting themselves evicted. One could only hope the estate agents carry out annual inspections going forward to ensure all tenants keep rentals in good condition.", "You aren\u2019t evicting them, and you didn\u2019t report them. That\u2019s the truth. You don\u2019t know that the visit was due to your request or not. You made a request, and a visit happened after that.

You weren\u2019t looking to create hassle for them, so much as avoid any hassle for yourself by entirely removing yourself from the block. And you gave no details about why you wanted to leave. But agree on keeping mum to the rest of the neighbours.", "NTA fun fact about landlords and real estate managers: they HATE dealing with property damage. The folks walking around wrecking things for fun are the only people responsible for the eviction and the loss of their security deposit", "NTA.  You didn't tell on your neighbors, you just asked the real estate agency about finding a better place to live.  If people got kicked out, that's because of their behavior - so it's all on them.", "You didn\u2019t mention any issues with neighbors when you made the call so, I don\u2019t see how this could possibly be your fault. Also, no other neighbors got evicted, did they? You\u2019ve done nothing to cause them to be homeless. They are 100% responsible for damaging the property so badly that it warranted immediate eviction. You are not in the wrong for wanting to live peacefully and safely. Nta", "NTA.    Everyone deserves a safe, quiet and respectful home regardless of socioeconomic standard (honestly, apology or no this was a really unfortunate way to think of it.)  \n\n\nThe problem isn't that they're not well off.  The problem is that they're criminals who are extraordinarily disrespectful of their neighbors.", "      ..\n?", "Exactly. Sadly, most landlords don't care about loud or drug-dealing tenants because that usually doesn't affect them much. They don't care if the other tenants are miserable as long as the rent arrives on time.

Your neighbors got themselves evicted because no landlord will tolerate that much property damage.", "Definitely NTA. You didn\u2019t rat them out or try to get them evicted. You planned to move, costing yourself more money and inconvenience. You tried not to harm them. But they were behaving horribly, causing problems for everyone around them, and damaging the property they were renting, the ones who got evicted did it to themselves, the agency was going to find out eventually. You did nothing wrong. \n\nOn that note I would never ever claim any responsibility or say you contacted anyone, the ones who got evicted sound a little unhinged and who knows what they\u2019d do if they decided you were to blame.", "The other neighbors asked you specifically if you'd reported them?", "NTA.

Absolutely nothing to be blamed for.", "You didn't get them evicted. The agency flagged your request as concerning. They investigated. Problem was found, and they were evicted. You had no clue this was going to be the outcome.\n\nI've lived in a number of places, some sketches than others. Bad neighbors are bad neighbors. I'm currently in a decent place location wise, but new bad neighbors have extremely worn out my patience, so I can say honestly you were way nicer than I'm about to be\n\nNTA", "NTA. You deserve to live where you are not scared and you are not obligated to deal with trashy people. You didn\u2019t file a complaint so bo you are not at fault.", "NTA. You didn't get your neighbors evicted,they did it to themselves. If they don't want to be homeless,then maybe they need to quit acting like a bunch of wild animals ( I don't mean to insult animals). You did nothing wrong here. Don't feel bad. Like your neighbor said,you actually did everyone else a favor. So,you did good.", "YTA, only because you didn't phone up to tell the people you rent from that there are people there fucking up the property. You're an adult, they aren't your friends, you aren't supposed to protec them and 'telling' on them isn't snitching or ratting on them, it's just being an adult.\n\nIf someone is smashing up security doors where I live, or smashing cars in the parking lot then you make the call to the landlord and/or cops because that person is doing criminal damage.", "Clearly you've never been in these situations. It is dangerous to tattle. You have to think these things through. Typically people are only willing to take the risk once it impacts them enough. That's a rational decision.", "NTA. You didn't rat them out. You didn't even make a complaint - which would've been within your rights anyway. \n\n\nAs someone pointed out - you didn't get them evicted, their bad decisions and erratic behavior did.", "NTA. Tell him no because you didnt. And dont feel bad. Being poor is no excuse for bad behavior as you described it.", "NTA. Don\u2019t accept guilt that doesn\u2019t belong to you. You didn\u2019t break the terms of your lease by destroying property. Your neighbors did that, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re being evicted. Whether you brought their behavior to the landlord\u2019s attention or not is IRRELEVANT. You did nothing wrong, and there is no reason for you to feel guilty. \n\nSounds like there\u2019s a good reason for you to feel fear, though. Definitely do not tell anyone about your conversation with the management. Just find a new place and get there ASAP.", "Just remember though, that doesn't mean you don't have great ways to report things anonymously. When it's an escalating issue of safety for you and your neighbors, you should report it in a way that can't be traced back to you, because your safety matters too."]}
