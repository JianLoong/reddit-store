I told him I would try but that it could be a little later. I figured I\u2019d be home by 6pm. He works for himself so he gets jobs done pretty early sometimes.

Absolutely not. You are a grown woman, his life partner, and the mother of his child. He DOES NOT get to tell you what you \"have to\" do or where you \"have to\" be. NOT EVER. You are not his child, and he is not your parent. Please listen to me, as someone who IS old enough to be your parent. I don't care what excuses he has, this is unhealthy AF. He doesn't get to make rules for you. If he wants something from you, he gets to ASK, to DISCUSS, and then to respect your opinion and feelings. He is not in charge of you.\n\n>He reminds me every chance he gets that he\u2019s only here because of me, and I get it but it\u2019s been years and I just think he needs to move on and stop holding it over my head as it also was his decision.\n\nThis. You are absolutely right. Sweetheart, you are the sensible, reasonable grownup here. I'm so sorry, but at this point I think the only thing to do is tell this man that if he is \"only here because of \\[you\\]\" then perhaps he needs to leave. Because you don't want someone who is so dependent on you that even after years of living there, he CANNOT FUNCTION without controlling your every move. It is so deeply unhealthy that he has freedom of movement, but demands that you and your child act as his emotional support animals, leashed to him, and unable to move about freely. I know you love him, but if this is how he treats you, you'd be better off without him.\n\nAnd as someone else noted, it's bad enough right now when your daughter is a baby, but his emotional codependence on your daughter as some sort of emotional support animal is even more horrifying when you realise that in just a few short years she is going to be a toddler, want playdates, push boundaries . . . and the WORST thing for her development will be daddy smothering her with his neediness and demanding that she be home whenever he \"needs\" her, instead of giving her the freedom to grow and thrive.\n\nSending you so much love. Honey, your perception of this situation is absolutely right. Not only are you NTA, but you are smart, and perceptive and you KNOW you deserve better. Take care of yourself and your daughter.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t care about spending time with his daughter, this rule is about control. He blames you for not living near his family and this is his way to constantly remind and punish you.

His only \u201cgive\u201d is moving to another state and he gets to \u201ctake\u201d everything else because of that?  No.  He made an agreement to move and can\u2019t keep holding it over your head", "NTA\n\nThis man sounds toxic and his incapability in building up a social life there after years is concerning.\n\nYou and the children need to live your own lives as well instead pleasing his idea of a 50ties marriage.\n\nEspecially when the girls become older and start to go out and dating you need to stand up for yourself and your children. \n\nThis level of controlling and guilt tripping is abuse.", "NTA.

It should be fine for you to go out with your daughter.\n\nNTA in my opinion. But I'd like some more clarification. Seems a bit hollow. Are there other things that happens that lead to disagreements like this?", "NTA. If he continues to have problems with moving 'for you,' then maybe you should consider going to therapy together.

I encourage my wife to do as much as she can socially because parenting is hard and lonely.", "NTA this seems a very strange thing to be controlling about.

You are to yourself and your daughter though if you Dont open your eyes and see whats happening. \n\nIts not the 50's anymore Op. You and kiddo do NOT have to be \"home and waiting\" every time your husband works. Thats not really thesable in a normal day to day household. You gotta keep your sanity. \n\nNotice the double standards. You have to be home for inage sake, but hes allowed to be out late when HE wants? No. Thats not ok. No one should ever tell someome what to do with their time and free will. He also is throwing the move in your face often? That my friend is textbook manipulative tactics. \n\nHes trying to guilt you into doing what he wants. You dont do what he wants, when and how he likes it?

I wish you resilience, confidence and the ability to look from a different perspective.", "NTA\n\nListen, this is not the way that a family dynamic works in reality. You are not expected to be waiting at home each day, child in arm at the door when your man arrives home. You are not a dog. \n\nYou are allowed your own freedom to go about your day and visit your family. It is not up to you to meet demands such as being home with your daughter waiting EVERY SINGLE DAY OF YOUR LIFE , for the moment he is home from work. That is not how it works. \n\nHis wishes do not dictate your actions. You are both individuals,  and you need to put your foot down about this controlling behavior.  \n\nAlso, in regards to your comments about his dislike of the state you're in....well, that's just too bad! Lots of us have to move for financial reasons or to help loved ones. It's totally valid to feel upset/depressed and to miss home... but he is in a committed relationship with a child. It's up to the both of you to figure out the path forward and decide where you want to be and where it  is realistic to be. If he is that miserable, and there are other options, maybe that needs to be a discussion. But he shouldn't be resentful towards you and using it as a weapon when it suits him. \n\nProper adult behavior would have him chill out and be flexible in his desire for you to be home every day. Rare occurances like this shouldn't be an issue whatsoever.  And again, he should seek help to work through his feelings of resentment and sadness about where you are living.

Does he (try to) control you in other ways, too?", "No. Long term life choices do not absolve one partner from the requirement to be flexible in the day-to-day minutiae of life. If you were asking to always be absent when he returns from work say every Monday it would be something to discuss but it's difficult to see any good reason for him to be unhappy with this on a one off basis. I can't even see a good reason for it to be  a discussion and not a simple notification that you may not be there when he gets back that day.", "NTA.  How long is he planning to have this demand?

It is more than reasonable for you girls to not be home as soon as he walks in the door.\n\nNow, expanding into the background, he has been keeping score of your marriage.

We lived together when he moved here, and obviously continued to do so, however, moving back to his home state is EXTREMELY expensive. Almost undoable, especially for people our age. It got the point where it just didn\u2019t make sense for us to move back as we would have had to lose independence and move in with his mom or something. We decided to get a nice apartment in a big city downtown instead while paying almost half of what we would pay for in an OLD apartment where he\u2019s from. We live in a big major city it\u2019s not like we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere, so I thought he would adjust. Now, we have a family so moving back makes even less sense as very average houses don\u2019t got for less than close to $1,000,000. We could buy 2-3 houses here for that price. I think about my daughter now and the thought of not being able to afford a house for YEARS  and continue to throw my money at landlords just to live in that state KILLS me.
