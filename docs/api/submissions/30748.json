YTA", "I note the long feedback to my comment re: 'disabled people' and advice.   I can't reply because I was immediately blocked.", "Okay, except disabled people are very used to other people offering (unsolicited!!) advice, that doesn't work for them because of the specific details of our situations that strangers don't have access to. Do you know how frustrating it is the hundredth time a random stranger is just trying to be helpful, and suggests something you've either already tried or have hard evidence won't work, and it's a coin flip that even if you say \"no thank you, I have a solution that is currently my best option, even if imperfect\", they'll get pissy that their help wasn't able to actually be helpful?\n\nIt's not \"throwing their kindness back in their face\" to first say \"hey, this doesn't work for these reasons\" while *still not seeking further unsolicited advice* (even if it DID turn out to be helpful!), and then when further advice is offering simply saying \"this is the solution I've settled on for now\".\n\nEven assuming the previous commenter, who I truly believe is a good person who was kind to try to help, has experience with problem solving, imagine one of EVERY OTHER PERSON IN YOUR COMPANY tries to offer you advice without being asked every time you have any sort of problem with your work. Imagine this includes people from other departments who have no idea what you actually do (abled people/people with unrelated disabilities). Imagine even when they are coworkers with your same exact job description (people with your exact disability and symptom profile), this is a solo project that you either already have a workable and approved, if imperfect solution to a complex problem. Imagine that even when you say so, you're told you're being rude for not *thanking\" them for a solution that is *objectively worse for the specific problem you're dealing with*.\n\nOP and the lovely commenter doing their best to offer advice *weren't even arguing*. Unsolicited advice is annoying at worst, and not at all something harmful or unkind. It is actively kind in most cases. Especially when coming from other disabled people, I have even appreciated it at times! It has in fact sometimes been helpful.\n\nI've also spent far too much of my life bending over backwards to fawn for people offering advice that they don't have the context to know is completely useless, just so they don't get MAD at me for the fact that my struggles *don't have easy solutions* and theirs simply *happened* to not apply.\n\nI have some advice to you: don't condescend to a disabled teen and tell them they're an asshole for at WORST *forgetting* a thank you while having a DISCUSSION about a workable solution and what doesn't work about the options suggested. And consider that maybe gratitude isn't even necessary when being offered solutions you didn't ask for about a problem you've effectively managed, potentially for your whole life, from someone who doesn't know the first thing about the problem itself.\n\nOnce again I'll reiterate that I do believe the other commenter is a kind and good person, and my annoyance at this general phenomenon is not at all their fault. But it also doesn't make *anyone* some generous angel for \"caring enough\" to *grace* poor suffering disabled people with their *invaluable* advice that we couldn't *possibly* have thought of, since that's another form of ableist microaggression we often face. That doesn't seem to be occurring here, given the level of experience that the other commenter has with glasses - I suspect they also are visually impaired or very close to someone who is, which is admittedly different.\n\nBut if you have the generous grace to offer us advice, consider having the grace to accept when that advice can't help us, when we don't express gratitude for a random stranger's opinion on our complex medical concerns, and when we are understandably sensitive due to hundreds if not thousands of bad experiences *on average* (at least if you have anything more than minimal support needs and exceedingly simple disabilities) even when we have been polite and grateful about turning such advice down. \n\nNeither OP nor the other commenter was a problem or did anything wrong here. You, on the other hand, are insufferable.", " Hmm, interesting take.", "Calling the dog names does make him an asshole.", " I have a sensitivity to feeling the small daily hurts of others, and this particular interaction felt 'off' in the way the commenter seemed kind and helpful and yet was rebuffed.  \n\nThat, then, prompted me to write. That's all.  \n\nYour interpretation could be the correct one, of course.  I'm fine with being wrong.", "It's my opinion after I read the exchange.   I felt quite sorry for the person who twice offered a solution and was rebuffed.   In conversations where a stranger is being kind it's pretty normal to show some sort of gratitude/courtesy.  That's not an argument, nor is it nonsense... it's called 'common' courtesy.", "This amuses me now because I honestly didn't see how this could even be a rebuff and it still wouldn't seem like that to me without more context for that direction. \n\nAre you from the southern US by chance? Your expectation of a kind acknowledgement of the helpful suggestion offered kinda reminds me of that souther politeness stuff."]}
