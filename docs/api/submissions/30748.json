I can't reply because I was immediately blocked.", "Okay, except disabled people are very used to other people offering (unsolicited!!) advice, that doesn't work for them because of the specific details of our situations that strangers don't have access to. Do you know how frustrating it is the hundredth time a random stranger is just trying to be helpful, and suggests something you've either already tried or have hard evidence won't work, and it's a coin flip that even if you say \"no thank you, I have a solution that is currently my best option, even if imperfect\", they'll get pissy that their help wasn't able to actually be helpful?\n\nIt's not \"throwing their kindness back in their face\" to first say \"hey, this doesn't work for these reasons\" while *still not seeking further unsolicited advice* (even if it DID turn out to be helpful!), and then when further advice is offering simply saying \"this is the solution I've settled on for now\".\n\nEven assuming the previous commenter, who I truly believe is a good person who was kind to try to help, has experience with problem solving, imagine one of EVERY OTHER PERSON IN YOUR COMPANY tries to offer you advice without being asked every time you have any sort of problem with your work. Imagine this includes people from other departments who have no idea what you actually do (abled people/people with unrelated disabilities). Imagine even when they are coworkers with your same exact job description (people with your exact disability and symptom profile), this is a solo project that you either already have a workable and approved, if imperfect solution to a complex problem. Imagine that even when you say so, you're told you're being rude for not *thanking\" them for a solution that is *objectively worse for the specific problem you're dealing with*.\n\nOP and the lovely commenter doing their best to offer advice *weren't even arguing*. Unsolicited advice is annoying at worst, and not at all something harmful or unkind. It is actively kind in most cases. Especially when coming from other disabled people, I have even appreciated it at times! It has in fact sometimes been helpful.\n\nI've also spent far too much of my life bending over backwards to fawn for people offering advice that they don't have the context to know is completely useless, just so they don't get MAD at me for the fact that my struggles *don't have easy solutions* and theirs simply *happened* to not apply.\n\nI have some advice to you: don't condescend to a disabled teen and tell them they're an asshole for at WORST *forgetting* a thank you while having a DISCUSSION about a workable solution and what doesn't work about the options suggested. And consider that maybe gratitude isn't even necessary when being offered solutions you didn't ask for about a problem you've effectively managed, potentially for your whole life, from someone who doesn't know the first thing about the problem itself.\n\nOnce again I'll reiterate that I do believe the other commenter is a kind and good person, and my annoyance at this general phenomenon is not at all their fault. But it also doesn't make *anyone* some generous angel for \"caring enough\" to *grace* poor suffering disabled people with their *invaluable* advice that we couldn't *possibly* have thought of, since that's another form of ableist microaggression we often face. That doesn't seem to be occurring here, given the level of experience that the other commenter has with glasses - I suspect they also are visually impaired or very close to someone who is, which is admittedly different.\n\nBut if you have the generous grace to offer us advice, consider having the grace to accept when that advice can't help us, when we don't express gratitude for a random stranger's opinion on our complex medical concerns, and when we are understandably sensitive due to hundreds if not thousands of bad experiences *on average* (at least if you have anything more than minimal support needs and exceedingly simple disabilities) even when we have been polite and grateful about turning such advice down. \n\nNeither OP nor the other commenter was a problem or did anything wrong here.

I felt quite sorry for the person who twice offered a solution and was rebuffed.   In conversations where a stranger is being kind it's pretty normal to show some sort of gratitude/courtesy.

Even with thin lenses, I need plastic frames because they are still too thick to look right on metal frames.

Kept having to go back to my old lenses because the new ones were giving me fishbowl effect....went back and forth for *ten years* before I got my hands on a pair of calipers and discovered that the new material was 33% thicker in places, then they finally were all 'ohhhhh year btw we *did* switch materials!'\n\nanyway long story short, I ended up switching to a different glasses place that didn't play games (because after 10 years, I *really really* needed new lenses that weren't scratched up). Unfortunately, my insurance company *does* like playing games and they'll only cover lenses with the awful thick material. And instead of just letting me pay for the difference when I upgrade to the decent material, they make me pay for the whole thing. Supposedly they'll pay for the thin material for \"people with strong prescriptions\" but my correction is in the -7.5 range, so if *that's* not considered strong, what is?

Then, you just enter it into the website when you set up your account. \n\nYou'll also need your pupillary distance (how far apart your pupils are). You can measure it yourself, but the exam place would have a tool that makes the measurement more accurate. And when you search for frames, entering the pupillary distance will help sort out frames that won't work for you.", "No, it's definitely not negligible.   I vary between -5 and -4, lower index lenses are so heavy they constantly slide down my nose.   They're basically unusable.", "I'm -5.75 and -6.00 with astigmatism in both eyes.  I got standard plastic rather than high-index lenses.  That was a mistake I won't be repeating in the future.  I will pay more for thinner lenses.\n\nThey are quite thick and yes, there's significant chromatic aberration, not only on the sides but very much at the top and bottom as the style these days seems to have moved away from more vertically narrow styles.  These are just larger lenses than I'm used to having all around.\n\nAnd they're surprisingly heavy.  I had no idea plastic lenses could be this heavy.\n\nThey sit heavy on my nose, and when I was visiting home last weekend my mother and I were talking about our relatively new frames (hers are a very nice blue) and she asked to take a closer look at mine.  When I handed them to her she commented on how heavy they were and asked if they were comfortable.  Not really, no.\n\nMy old frames were very old - I finally replaced them for reasons of wear and tear rather than aesthetics.  I'd used them through several lens updates.  But the lenses were much less tall on those and so I never really had these issues of strong chromatic aberration (maybe a little bit on the sides but it was never a problem, and *never* at top or bottom) nor the heavy weight that's going on now.\n\nI actually feel like I have less *useful* viewing angle vertically now than before, despite that the lenses are taller.\n\n*Edit:  Wrote wrong numbers at the start, ha ha.  Stupid memory.*", "You can buy yheir frames and lenses without a prescription. They have some cute sunglasses options!
