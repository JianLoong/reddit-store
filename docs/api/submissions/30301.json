We speak and joke a bit, he seems to make a lot of irony and the conversation goes well. At one point he kind of brags about a success of his and I answer by the short sentence \"bsartek\" which means congrats in Arabic. I usually use this word in my common language, with people from Arabic origins or not, doesn't matter. It's just as if I would pop out an English or Spanish word mid sentence. Most people in France know the meaning of this word. No one has ever told me it wasn't appropriate for me to say that.\n\nFor the notice the word is common language and has no link with religion or historical events whatsoever.\n\nHe simply answered \"You're not allowed to speak arabic\". As the guy did irony before in the conversation, I laughed at his comment as if it was a joke. The guy doesn't laugh, looks me in the eye and repeats : \"no seriously you're not allowed to speak arabic, I am not joking\". I was honestly so shocked/pissed at that moment. I answered \"Why?\" he simply said \"you're not allowed that's it\"\nI was extremely pissed, stopped for a bit and said \"then you're not allowed to speak french\" he answered \"what you said is extremely racist\" I answered \"you're the one who's saying absurd stuff\". The conversation stopped. We never spoke again during the evening even though he was still sat next to me. It definitely felt uncomfortable for the whole night.\n\nIdk what to think, I may have overreacted and said something really border. But also I was so pissed by him stopping a friendly chat to forbid me to speak an ENTIRE language. Can he speak for the entire arabic community. Can he forbid me to learn/speak a language? And the order : as if he had authority over me. I felt like this was really rude as we litteraly just met. He then refused to give me an explanation and be opened to a conversation where he could have given me receivable arguments and make me understand his point.\nI thought what he was asking was so unfair/dumb/discriminative.\nAlthough I somewhat regret what I said.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?", "created_utc": 1699105858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nm3bq/aita_for_telling_someone_hes_not_allowed_to_speak/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're French and not in language class or practicing Arabic with like-minded friends, you should be speaking French too.\n\nPopping in an English word occasionally is normal, that's a global language.

It's a racist use of the language. Because if a person looking Arabic use it the impact is not the same, they usually are let with racism in France. If you as a white person you use it, you evade the consequences the guy you met usually gets. So it's best if you're white to refrain flexing with words that are not french. I mean it's more considerate if you mean. Saying he was not aloud to speak French was indeed racist because it doesn't carry the same stigma.\n\nBut that should have been explained by the dude. His reaction was abrupt and hard to understand without the context. You can't invent such a context if you have zero knowledge in anti racism. It's not always fun to educate white people when you're a victim of racism but you can't expect people to understand stuff without context. That's stupid.\n\nYou weren't strongly an asshole, I'll add, you made an honest uneducated mistake, you wanted to bond but did a faux pas that underlines the unfairness of speaking Arabic in France, it's cool if you're white, it's bad if you're not.\n\nMaybe refrain to speak Arabic with people you don't know in case it would make them uncomfortable.

I'm only conveying what I've been taught and what I suppose caused the situation. You're free not to apply the rule.\n\nBut I knew I was gonna be down voted to oblivion, white people have a very fragile ego when they're been taught about hardship lived by victims of racism.\n\nI'm french too btw. So I know what I'm talking about :))))", "It's actually Yiddish", "Or Yeslamoo if you\u2019re from Pal/the levant :)", "Yeah I mean there are weirdos out there. Plus OP did state that they had lots of friends with Arab origins that taught them stuff, so that checks out with the majority of Arabs being happy to see you speak/ teach you Arabic. Maybe it was just the one guy.", "White guilt is so weird and cringe.", "I was thinking \u0627\u0646\u0628\u0633\u0637 \u0644\u0643 said fast? But it\u2019s more \u201cI\u2019m happy for you\u201d than congratulations\n\nu/Fruits_salade are you sure the person taught you a correct word?", "never heard of that interesting. must be commonly used in Algeria cause the typical Arabic for congratulation is \u201cmabrok\u201d", "Yeah I see that. I just cant remember reading that the guy was misogynistic or thatche said anything misogynistic. \n\nOr is it just because a man was an ass towards a woman? That isnt inherently misogynistic unless he was an ass BECAUSE shes a woman, but because he wouldnt give a reason we dont know", "It could be misogyny here, but \u201cbeing rude and unreasonable to someone who happens to be a woman\u201d is not the diagnostic for it. If he wouldn\u2019t have acted the same way towards a man, which could be true but we can\u2019t know, then that\u2019s definitely misogynistic. Calling that shit out is important, but it\u2019s also important not to overuse the term when there\u2019s no evidence that was the motivation. Maybe he did react like that because of misogynistic beliefs, but with what information we have that\u2019s a leap and there\u2019s a lot of stuff clearly at the surface that we can point to instead.", "\u201cPossibly some are Muslim\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the guy in question is. And even if he was it has nothing to do with the problem. Most Muslims, me included, don\u2019t even speak Arabic and only know the words they use in prayer or while reading the Qur\u2019an and some others for greetings and the like. \n\nThe person who made the comment I replied to directly makes the jump from Arab to muslim because they\u2019re racist and then went on with their islamophobia caused by whatever they\u2019re fed by the media and their close ones every day.", "Actually it's Hebrew (with the first word being pronounce ma-ZAL), dating back  roughly 1500 years ago to the Talmudic Academies in Iraq, which was incorporated into Yiddish in the early 1800s (with the first word being pronounced MA-zel), and into American English in the mid-1800s.", "Israeli here and thank you. Origins are not in Hebrew!", "I think that by and large people are happy you\u2019ve tried to learn their language. I\u2019ve been learning Danish for a few years and Danes are often baffled by this but also pleased. But some people get weird and gatekeepy about it, as they do with basically everything.", "Yeah that\u2019s fair, we don\u2019t really know what his reasoning was", "I love when the linguists show up because I learn something new", "By all means the guy might be. But I dont want to assume. Either way, OP is NTA and the guy definitely is"]}
