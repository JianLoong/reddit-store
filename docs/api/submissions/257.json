I always blamed my sister for everything and I knew exactly which strings i needed to pull so that my parents would defend me. Really, I was a horrible child. And if it wasn't for my sister, i think would've never changed. She always told me about how terribly wrong my actions are, and as i got older, i started to realize (since I've always looked up to her and her opinion matters a lot to me) how much of a brat i actually was. It's not that it would've just been that way with my family, but also with friends etc. So thinking back, i am so very thankful for this!\nAnd by then, i started changing a lot and doing a massive character development. And i am so extremely thankful for my sister, we have a great relationship now! \n\nSo at that point, maybe telling her off helps since she doesn't seem to realize that she's being horrible to you (and probably to others around her aswell) and someday she changes? It did work for me tho. Plus, all you did was being brutally honest and I don't see why you should apologize to her since you've just told the truth.", "Not enough information to judge. How did this all start? Your sister does sound like a brat from the description you\u2019re painting.", "NTA. you have no reason to apologize", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
