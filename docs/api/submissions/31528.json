Then, you are totally right in what you wetr saying. I believe she was just trying to guiltrip you into feeling sorry for herself so she can keep some control over you.\n\nYou shouldn't have to do almost all the house chores. If it's allowed and normal at 16 in your country, you should be able to get a job. I'd say get one anyway and save the money, so when you are 18 you can think about leaving the house", "NTA\n\nthat's a very valid point of view to have", "NTA bruv, but you should try to limit your cursing at your mom.

Middle school here is 7th and 8th grade which is for 12- and 13-year-olds typically.  \n\nI don't know why your mother seems to be stopping your progress in life, maybe she just wants a free housekeeper.\n\nNTA, not even close.", ">it wasn't like that when I was a girl, we were respectful to our parents\n\nSpeaking as someone who is the same age as your mother's parents: this is utter bullshit.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you're perfectly right.", "NTA, absolutely.", "NTA for your feelings....you are bang on.\n\nYTA for blurting out and cursing at her. This may be why she treats you like a child.\n\nFurther, many parents treat sons and daughters differently. Daugters stay home and help with 'mom chores' while boys only need to worry about going and getting jobs.  \n\nCould also be your mom is suffering loss of son being around, and wants to cling tightly to you.  Wrong, but might explain her behaviour.\n\nYou still need to speak respectfully to your parents though, you don't swear at them when you just lost your cool, especially when others could hear you.
