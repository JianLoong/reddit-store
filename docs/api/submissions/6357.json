He was always running marathons so he had quite a few medals. He once ran a marathon at disney land and I always loved seeing the medal he received there since I'm a huge disney fan, so he decided to give it to me. That made younger me very happy and I still cherish that medal up to this day. \n\nSadly, my grandpa died from cancer when i was 14 years old, so this medal became twice as important to me as it is a way for me to remember him every day. When he died, my aunt wanted for both my cousins to get medals my grandpa got at some marathons as a memory of him but she decided that the medal he gave me was the best one and wanted me to give it to her so her sons can have it as a memory of their grandpa.\n\nKeep in mind, he gave it to me while he was still alive!! He chose for me to have it! I was still very young so i was crying and didnt want to give it, and while me and my mom don't usually argue for objects, this one had a sentimental value.\n\nMy aunt kept arguing with us saying, \"You already had that medal for a few years. Why can't you just give it to your cousins? They deserve a pretty medal from grandpa too!\" We kept arguing for days until she gave up and gave them some random medals he got at some marathons and we all received a picture frame from the most recent photoshoot we had done with our grandpa, which had a picture of him running and a picture of us with him.\n\nIm very happy to have been able to keep the medal he gave me but i keep wondering, AITA for not giving it to my aunt so my cousins could have it too?\n\nEdit: my aunt married into the family. My mom is related to my uncle. So she's even further into the family. She also barely comes over, not even once a year and doesn't even know the medal is in my room.\n\nThanks for all the supportive comments everyone \ud83d\ude0a", "created_utc": 1672709640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101uatt/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_aunt_the_medal_my/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would trust your aunt not to try and swipe while she\u2019s over anyways. I also don\u2019t have a lot of faith in your mother for the reason she could eventually allow herself to be steamrolled by her sister and figure the shitstrom you\u2019d throw would be smaller than the one she\u2019s currently throwing. It\u2019s fucked up but true, and happens all the time. Don\u2019t give anyone the benefit of the doubt when it comes to that medal or you\u2019ll regret it forever.

Your grandpa gave it to YOU because he knew it would mean something to you. You don't give away sentimental gifts like that. You deserve to have that to remember your grandpa. Your cousins can have other medals. To ask for yours is absurd. Your aunt is a major AH for her entitled behavior.", "I'd find that medal a safe place to keep away from prying hands, less it go missing.", "NTA. Your aunt obviously doesn't care for its personal value because there were other medals she could have asked to pass to her children. She does however value the medal as some Disney collectible memorabilia. Keep this lovely token from your grandfather. It was meant for you.", "NTA - tell your aunt your grandfather gave it to YOU not to her, not to her sons \u2026 to YOU as a keepsake because he wanted YOU to have it. \n\nAlso bring your mother and father into this.", "NTA. She's a selfish biatch."]}
