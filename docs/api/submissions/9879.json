Could this be an issue for her?  If it\u2019s not an issue and she is just wanting the area because it\u2019s larger and she can have access to the kitchen while talking, she can suck it up and take a soda/snack in the bedroom with her like the rest of us who do therapy at home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
