It would give me a good excuse to go for a walk, do my grocery shopping, go have coffee with a friend\u2026 not everything needs to become an issue. There\u2019s also give and take - could OP then ask something of the roommate in return? Yeah boundaries are extremely important but so is being accommodating *if* it works (as I said - OP is absolutely not obligated to agree to this request as it is shared space after all). I\u2019m hung up on the fact that it\u2019s only one session every second week - if it was a weekly thing I would likely think differently.", "\"You Call that Traumatic? Try sitting through this session!\"", ">IMO it\u2019s not that hard to do something for an hour a week at that time in order to be a good person to someone you live with.\n\n**This works both ways!!!**"]}
