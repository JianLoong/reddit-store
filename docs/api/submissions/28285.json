Fuck Debbie. NTA", "ESH", "Viscous but awesome.

It's for parents of a new child (not  her), caring for a seriously ill family member (not her), dealing with issues related to the military (not her), and for recovering from a serious illness, including mental illness (her, apparently). To qualify for mental health FMLA, you need to be so sick that you require inpatient care or multiple consecutive days of serious treatment to function. Most employers require paperwork from a doctor or mental health professional proving the extent of the illness before FMLA is granted. Often folks on mental health FMLA are mentally ill to the point of legal disability (though you don't need a diagnosis to qualify). So someone on FMLA for mental health is really, seriously fragile and ill. Let's put a pin in that; it'll be relevant shortly.\n\nSometimes people suck and you need to put on your big kid undies and learn to deal with it like an adult instead of a high school bully. Maybe she's a horrid shrew who delights in spreading her awful advice and controlling young people. Maybe she's just old, out-of-touch, and distracted by the huge personal tragedy that is so vast she has medical intervention and legal protection for it (FMLA says she is SUFFERING right now, jfc) and she didn't even realize she was being rude, she just thought she was bonding with the young people.\n\nRegardless, she still has a right to be safe at work. If you have a problem with her behavior, talk to her about it like an adult, or talk to HR/management/someone who can talk to her for you. Or use your big kid coping skills! Sing a song in your head when she talks. Don't respond to the things she says. *Walk away* from conversations you don't want to be in. Throwing her personal tragedy in her face to shut her up is awful and, given the FMLA mental health leave, might also be ableist. She is experiencing significant mental illness as a result of a specific event, and you invoked that event to harm and silence her because you didn't like her office chat; that *sucks.* You need to get a handle on your anger and learn to walk away.\n\n(Edit: fixed an autocorrect mistake, freaking => dealing, lol)", "Honestly, YTA.

Especially to older generations, giving that sort of commentary was normal and mostly accepted.  This is especially the case from older women and related to parenting - there were far less resources for young parents and the main source of information was word-of-mouth from other older women.  It's dated and it's not behavior that's aged well, but Debbie's choices are not wildly out of line for someone of that age.  \n\nThat said, she's still meaningfully out of line *now*.  And similarly, even to that generation - the idea was that if someone communicated advice was unwelcome, the person giving it took that in stride and knocked off. Someone constantly giving unsolicited & unwelcome advice was still understood as out of line - even in an era when the general practice was more accepted.  If she knew her advice wasn't welcome, or had been told unsolicited advice of that sort is no bueno with younger people - she should be able to abide by that.  Clapping back if she's been persistent in continuing her unwelcome offerings is not any further out of line than the advice itself was.  \n\nIf she's never been told to butt out and back off, if she has no real directly-communicated reason to understand her commentary is unwelcome - OP's response was an absolute haymaker coming out of the darkest blue.  On Debbie's end, if no one told her to stuff her advice prior ... today, she was being nice and reasonable and 'helping' someone - and then one guy from the office pretty much just verbally sucker-punched her with the lowest blow possible, for \"no reason\" that she was aware of.", "someone in another post used the phrase \"justifiable asshole maneuver\" which may cover this situation", "I mean..is it just a matter of unsolicited advice, or how harmful her advice can be", "\"Debbie had that clapback coming\"?  Are you serious???  OP is VERY MUCH TA here.   First of all, it wasn't even OP that Debbie was talking to!  Sure, maybe she doesn't give great advice, and she shouldn't give it if it's unwanted.  But I think there's a HUGE difference between her telling SOMEONE ELSE that their kid should try to \"tough out\" whatever problem they're having in elementary school and OP swanning in completely unasked to rub it in the face of a lady who, in OP's OWN WORDS \"took some time off work to deal with the *trauma*\" that her son is going to prison forever and OP at least in some part thinks it's her fault.

What she did was annoying but well intentioned. What you did was vindictive.", "YTA OP. What she says is annoying. What you said was cruel.\n\nThe fact it was \"out of your mouth\" in such a knee-jerk reaction just shows that the cruel goes to the bone.", "YTA.  What a low blow.  And you\u2019re an asshole for taking the very first opportunity you had to remind her that her child is going to prison.", "YTA-sounds like Debby was trying to clumsily be apart of a conversation and a simple, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for advice\u201d would have suffice.  The fact that her kid is in trouble and your rubbing that in her face is gross.", "Yta you went for the jugular over a conversation that wasn't even about your? Maybe you should mind your own damn business. Your coworker brought up their kid so it sounds like they were soliciting advice.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t throw it in her face; you stabbed her in the heart, then backed her over with your car a couple of times. You are not a good person And I don\u2019t trust your narrative", "Sheesh. I get that unsolicited parenting advice is annoying, but she didn't deserve that one. Have some self control; you're not in middle school anymore, and you can't just say whatever pops into your head just because \"they deserve it\".", "YTA. Congratulations on making a bad situation even worse.  After all, you butted in on the conversation. As for HR, start looking for another job.", "ESH \nIt sounds you were fed up with her and had a momentary lapse in judgment. Hopefully she learned her lesson and will keep herself out of others conversations.", "Everybod sucks", "She should\u2019ve kept her mouth shut all those times. If she doesn\u2019t like it, then she should not dish it out", "Sounds like Debbie finally learned that unsolicited advice is always criticism. Maybe she will mind her own business next time.", "Deserved she needed that reality check", "NTA.  The thing about people like Debbie is that they count on the rest of us being polite and/or quiet.", "NTA", "NTA. People need to stop with the unsolicited parenting advice.", "ESH, yes, she's an annoying woman, and it would be fine to tell her that you're not soliciting parenting advice. But holy shit, did you go too far.", "ESH but you more.\n\nYep, unsolicited bad advice sucks, but this was such a cruel thing to say.", "There should really be a justified ahole category.", "YTA.", "Debbie is annoying but Goddamn.\n\nShe stepped on your foot, and you responded by burning her house down. \n\nJust tell her to watch where she\u2019s going next time, dog. \n\nYTA", "NTA.\n\nLike it or not, but if you want to go around giving people unsolicited and judgemental advice, you need to be ready for people challenging you on why you have the authority to do so.", "Agree with ESH! Debbie sounds obnoxious, but damn, OP went scorched earth. I get that it's really been grating on OP and she snapped, but this is why it's important to find a way to speak up before you're at the absolute end of your rope. It's so much more effective to take Debbie aside and say, \"You know, Debbie, sometimes people just want to vent. I think \\[coworker\\] was looking for a sympathetic ear, not a lecture.\" If she doesn't take the hint after a few repetitions of this conversation, at that point you can say, \"We have very different parenting philosophies, Debbie. Let's agree to disagree and not discuss it going forward. If I'm having a parenting conversation with someone else, I would appreciate it if you would not insert yourself into that conversation.\" That's what adults do, especially in the workplace.", "I have a criminal in my family and, my word, the trauma surrounding the whole situation runs deep. She's probably already dealing with feeling responsible for whatever her son did.", "Holy shit, this is a good take.  The way you outlined this, everything you said.  Nailed it.", "Not that I think what OP said was kind or appropriate, but don\u2019t you think this might be just a *touch* dramatic.  A \u2018tragedy\u2019?  \u2018She has the right to be safe at work\u2019?  She wasn\u2019t unsafe.  I know we don\u2019t apparently believe in not being a complete snowflake anymore, but someone said mean words to her.  That\u2019s it.  She didn\u2019t hit her, or threaten too.", "Not at work.", "Yes \ud83d\udc4f", "This! Not only was it unnecessarily hurtful contextually, it's likely a fireable offense some places. Definitely on OP's record now. YTA.", "I'm child free, this was vicious and cruel. Op is a bad person. Debbie is annoying but come on.", "I agree.  It\u2019s just unnecessary and a low blow.", "And sociopaths.", "I'm convinced this sub is now definitely largely Gen Z. The takes are wild.", "Children and the emotionally immature, I fear.", "Lol I hope you don't have children", "You don't have to be Debbie to have some empathy for her. What OP said was cruel. Just because people find what OP said satisfying does not make it kind or justified.", "This sub has always been batshit. No need to shit on Gen Z specifically.", "I have 3.  And they all know that words aren\u2019t dangerous", "Not sure what kind of people are downvoting this. Jesus, it\u2019s a mild rebuke at best", "I mean she's clearly a great parent based on her child's actions.  Her shitty advice is probably the reason her son is where he is.", "I have known a lot of good parents that had a crappy kid.  I also have known crappy parents that had good kids.", ">have a great day is rude\n\nWhen it's delivered with the sarcastic tone you clearly used, you're damn right."]}
