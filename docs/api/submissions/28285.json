Fuck Debbie. NTA", "ESH", "Viscous but awesome. NTA", "How many times did you ask her to stop butting in before you weaponized her family tragedy against her?\n\nIf you have been having conversations with her asking her to change her behavior, what did HR say when you told them that she was making the work environment uncomfortable by not responding to your requests that she stop offering unsolicited advice?\n\nOutside of a scenario where you have had clear and open conversations about how inappropriate her behavior is, YTA.\n\nBefore we dive into why, let's take a moment to look at the FMLA. It's for parents of a new child (not  her), caring for a seriously ill family member (not her), dealing with issues related to the military (not her), and for recovering from a serious illness, including mental illness (her, apparently). To qualify for mental health FMLA, you need to be so sick that you require inpatient care or multiple consecutive days of serious treatment to function. Most employers require paperwork from a doctor or mental health professional proving the extent of the illness before FMLA is granted. Often folks on mental health FMLA are mentally ill to the point of legal disability (though you don't need a diagnosis to qualify). So someone on FMLA for mental health is really, seriously fragile and ill. Let's put a pin in that; it'll be relevant shortly.\n\nSometimes people suck and you need to put on your big kid undies and learn to deal with it like an adult instead of a high school bully. Maybe she's a horrid shrew who delights in spreading her awful advice and controlling young people. Maybe she's just old, out-of-touch, and distracted by the huge personal tragedy that is so vast she has medical intervention and legal protection for it (FMLA says she is SUFFERING right now, jfc) and she didn't even realize she was being rude, she just thought she was bonding with the young people.\n\nRegardless, she still has a right to be safe at work. If you have a problem with her behavior, talk to her about it like an adult, or talk to HR/management/someone who can talk to her for you. Or use your big kid coping skills! Sing a song in your head when she talks. Don't respond to the things she says. *Walk away* from conversations you don't want to be in. Throwing her personal tragedy in her face to shut her up is awful and, given the FMLA mental health leave, might also be ableist. She is experiencing significant mental illness as a result of a specific event, and you invoked that event to harm and silence her because you didn't like her office chat; that *sucks.* You need to get a handle on your anger and learn to walk away.\n\n(Edit: fixed an autocorrect mistake, freaking => dealing, lol)", "Honestly, YTA. You said yourself her advice is \"never asked for and she just butts in conversation\". Yet here she was discussing it with a coworker and it was you that butt in the conversation to make a personal attack with the clear intention to humiliate. Yeah, definitely YTA.", "Have you  asked her to stop prior to this? Was it ever discussed that her advice is unwanted? If so, NTA. But if it was never discussed and you just snapped, then, YTA", "Ehhhh. Soft YTA\n\nI would've prob told Debbie \"you might to take care of your own house first\"\nOr at least told her that privately.", "you absolutely do not suck in the situation, despite all these e s h determinations.
