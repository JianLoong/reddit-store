You get the car and lose an asshole at the same time.", "NTA. She was never truly your friend if she reacted this way. A 26 year old is acting like a 13 year old. I know it sucks now but it is for the best. Who needs such a self centered AH as a friend anyway?", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nYou are not responsible for knowing that your best friend and her dad were interested in the same car you purchased. It's unfortunate that there was a miscommunication, but it was not intentional on your part. You had been looking for a car for months and found one that suited your needs.\r  \n\r  \nYour best friend's reaction seems extreme and uncalled for. Blocking you on social media and cutting off communication without giving you a chance to explain or apologize is not a fair response. It's important for friends to communicate openly and honestly, especially when misunderstandings occur.\r  \n\r  \nYou can try reaching out to your best friend to express your genuine surprise and apologize for any unintended hurt caused. However, ultimately, her reaction is her responsibility, and it's up to her to decide whether she wants to salvage the friendship.\r  \n\r  \nGetting your first car is an exciting milestone, and you deserve to celebrate it. It's unfortunate that this situation has dampened your joy, but it's important to remember that you did nothing wrong. Surround yourself with supportive people who are genuinely happy for your achievements.", "The seller would have ignored them for a reason, FB sales don't take a week. They were probably messing the seller around or sometime. \n\nAlso, that's not how friends react and it's a second hand car for heavens sake.\n\nNTA, and I know it sucks but you're better off without \"friends\" like that \ud83d\ude06", "NTA. Your best friend sucks and shouldn't be your best friend let alone even your friend if that is her reaction. I'd make sure to drive by her house everyday and honk in the new car.", "NTA\n\nHow would you even know she was looking at it?", "NTA - With friends like these who need enemies?", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault the seller didn't message her back. She really can't blame you for it, but that doesn't mean she won't. This would be something real dumb for her to totally cut you out of her life for, but you can't control what she does. \n\nI would brace yourself to find another BFF... and if she comes to her senses, that's great, but since I don't know your friend, I don't have a gauge on whether she's that way or not. My bestie and I have had rough patches, especially when we were younger, but so far nothing we didn't bounce back from. I hope that's what happens with you.", "NTA - This is where I end up saying something obnoxious like \"What is wrong with you?\" because what is wrong with her?  There is no possible way you knew her dad was trying to buy that car.  She has clearly transferred her (and her dad's) anger onto you unfairly.\n\nYou need to stop worrying about what you did, because you didn't do anything and frankly, I don't know that you should say anything to her other than I don't understand why you are upset with me.  How could I have known?", "Don't you realize? You were supposed to \"just know\" that she wanted this.\n\n**NTA**. If your friendship explodes over something as petty and silly as this, the explosion was just waiting for any small spark.\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong. If your ex-friend tries to apologize, don't accept it. You should not be worrying about not stepping on invisible egg shells to maintain a fragile friendship.", "That sucks.  However, you are better off.  She is a rotten tomato of a person.  Be glad this person is out of your life.  NTA.", "NTA.  Congratulations on both the new-to-you car and the loss of a fake friend  :)", "lol?  Why is she so mad?  NTA at all, she is reacting very strangely", "NTA.  Her extreme over reaction to something you weren't even aware of tells me that you are better off without her as a \"friend\"", "NTA. Someone else\u2019s jealousy is not your issue. You had no knowledge about her looking at that car. Give it some time. She may come around and apologize at which point you can decide if you want to continue the relationship. But either way enjoy your new car and the freedom that comes with it.", "NTA- if the car ended your  friendship, then it never was one. The question to ask is what about that didn't you see? It's also possible that your friend is just taking it out on you and will get over this and apologize soon, but that is some immature shit.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong and any sane person would not have reacted like she did. When she inevitably apologizes and wants to be friends again, please do not take her back as a friend. Only bad people react negatively to others accomplishments. She will continue to drag you down so take this as seeing who she really is and keep her away.", "She was never your friend. Sounds like there was always some jealousy there and now you getting the car she wants pushed her over the edge. I know it hurts but forget her. Go enjoy your car (congrats btw!), you did nothing wrong. Don\u2019t let her nastiness rob you of this exciting milestone! Also, NTA!", "NTA. she's not your friend. Move on and forget about her.", "a car didn't end your friendship; she did!", "NTA and she\u2019s no friend, if she comes back and \u2018decides\u2019 to forgive you, tell her to stick it where the sun doesn\u2019t shine!\n\nAll over a car, sounds like she\u2019s not mature enough to be driving herself \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nShe deliberately ruined your new car moment!", "NTA. You guys sound like you are 12 not 25. She needs to grow up. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Your most unstable friend blocked you? WIN!", "NTA. A REAL friend would be happy and excited for you regardless. It's not like y'all were looking at the car together, she called \"dibs\" and you bought it before she had a chance. She NEVER TOLD YOU about it. How can anyone be angry with somebody for something like this? You don't have telepathy, she can't LOGICALLY be angry if she NEVER TOLD YOU HER PLAN. How ridiculous!  I will never understand how someone directs anger at their friend for something the friend never knew. \n\nShe CAN be angry about THE SITUATION, because she feels like the seller didn't give her and her dad a fair chance, and that can be upsetting. Her anger at you is unreasonable because you did NOT KNOW her plan. I'm really sorry your friend is projecting her anger at the situation onto you and blaming you for \"taking\" the car she wanted. Maybe she will come to see that it's not YOU she should be angry with, but the situation. If she doesn't, you will be hurting for a while for losing your friend over HER issues, YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. Grieve the friendship as you must and find new people to have fun with.\n\nAlso: CONGRATULATIONS on your FIRST CAR!  How exciting!", "NTA , your ex friend sounds unhinged . I\u2019m sorry you lost a friend but this my be a blessing. Real friends do not go off the rails over a car. Congratulations on your new car, I hope you have a good summer.", "You learned a valuable lesson, a lot of friends are not real friends. People are jealous and petty af, figure out who shows  up for you when times are low. You should wave at her with your new car, congrats!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
