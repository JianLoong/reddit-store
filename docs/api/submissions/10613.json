She said it stinks why didn't you listen to her. Her experience was bad and you're acting as if it's nothing.", "YTA. Your daughter warned you that that the horses were likely to fart and crap, things which would ruin the experience and she turned out to be right. Instead of a wonderful experience that the two of you could share and bond over, you subjected her to a 60 minute hell ride. I'm guessing you didn't have the maturity to either acknowledge that you were in the wrong or to apologise and you think she's the bad person here? Instead of fond memories, all she's taken away from this is that her parent is an insensitive graceless jerk who's too proud to admit a mistake.", " YTA - She told you that she didn\u2019t want to sit there and you made her do it anyway. You owe her an apology for disregarding her feelings and subjecting her to a very gross ride.", "YTA. She didn't want to do something but you insisted on it. Your daughter hated it but you were amused by it.", "You were amused by watching the horses crapping and farting for an hour.  Your daughter, who didn't have your cold, found it deeply unpleasant because she got the full effect. \n\nHow little it takes to entertain you!\n\n\nYTA", "YTA for not validating her feelings. How hard is it to be like \"yeah you were right, we should have sat inside. Sorry.\" Yes, she may be overreacting at this point, but it's because you keep telling her it \"wasn't that bad\" rather than admitting that she was right.", "I think YTA because your daughter warned you that the horses were likely to be smelly, which was proven to be true. It was supposed to be fun for both of you; there could have been a compromise. You still would have enjoyed the ride and views sitting elsewhere. I rode in a carriage when I was young, and I didn't smell anything awful from where I sat. \n\nYour daughter did overreact, although some people are more sensitive to smells than others. Bad smells can put me off food. The real reason your daughter was angry might have been because you ignored her warning, so she dramatised her response to make a (petty) point.", ">she was right that the horses were gassier than I expected, and they passed gas and relieved themselves a surprising number of times for a one-hour carriage ride. My daughter hated it and would gag each time and turn away.\n\nWell. I hope you had fun watching her almost throw up repeatedly, because she obviously didn't. She told you that she was going to hate the experience, you decided that you didn't care as long as you got the experience you wanted, and then you have the gall to say that she was overreacting when she didn't want to talk to the person who proved that they're happy to put her in situations where she's clearly stated she's uncomfortable. \n\nYTA. And I hope that you're the one who bought her ticket, because if she had to pay for this shitty experience then you should be paying her back for ruining it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or no.", "AHH well. At least she won't be wanting you to fork out for a horse drawn carriage for her wedding.", "Gonna refrain from giving a rating because the situation isn't very cut and dry. She was being bratty before the ride to be sure, but also like, she was right. Horses fart and shit and piss constantly and it's not very fun sitting directly behind them. You had no idea so you weren't an asshole, but still owe her an apology for causing her to have a bad night.", "NTA. You just wanted a nice and private moment with ur daughter and tried to make that happen.  \n\nAnd to be fair to you I doubt they would've stopped everything halfway through once you realised how much gas the horses expel?  So it was an honest mistake in that way.  \n\nGagging and retching and not eating later are the dramatic over reactions of the teenage child.   And if she eats meat at all...btw... she may wish to acquaint herself with the real lives of the animals she's happy to eat.  \n\nBeing a teenager, the exact same experience with a group of her friends may well have prompted joking and laughter.\n\nYou did nothing wrong,  and yet won't do that again either.  Let's not lose sight of the fact that you just wanted to do something nice with your daughter... you absolutely did not put her through hell like other commenters would have you believe.... I've been in some very difficult life situations at your daughters age.... and riding up top with some gassy horses for an hour cannot be described as hell for goodness sake.", "NTA - your daughter is a teenaged girl.  No matter what seat you took, she'd hate it.  (source: father of four daughters)", "Jesus Christ, has the girl never been around a horse? Yeaaa, they void themselves. Like, duh. \n\nEven if you had sat where she wanted, she sounds like the kind to complain that the back of the carriage was too dark, crowded, and stuffy and, she couldn\u2019t see anything, anyway. \n\nIt sounds like a little hour of hell.

Yep.", "NTA - you picked a seat that seemed good. I would have done the same, ie get away from the crowd and have a clearer view.\n\nThese are memories you can laugh about.", "INFO: Is it that bad from horses? I've never been around horses so I have no clue, but I've never heard of this being a problem from horse people.\n\nI know I've heard at least 3 horse girls say \"Oh no horses don't stink at all, their poo is just basically grass and is the best poop of all animals\" but I know I've seen a video once (back in like 2006) of someone throwing up from a horse fart on a farm, so now I don't know who to believe.\n\nIs \"horse stink\" that bad, or are the horse girls right?", "Sorry I need info here... Horses diaper??\n\nIs that a thing? I need to Google it", ">Even a few inches more space between you and a horses ass, can make a HUGE difference in regards to the smell\n\nHaha wow, sounds like you speak from experience?\n\nI wondered about that because I remember the post about the [\"riding-under-tail\" cavalry military discipline](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wgufu6/aita_for_making_light_of_my_grandpas_unpleasant/) and people were saying it would be the worst form of torture and the smell would traumatize you, but seems like many think this is no big deal.\n\nGuess those last 5 feet or whatever makes that big of a difference?", "Hell?!?  PMSL. Over reactor over here too!", "My 5 mo formula only poops are RANCID compared to my toddler's poop.", "Have you never smelt a vegan's fart?", "Dog, cat or human is way, way worse. Like the worst. I did grow up with horses so that might have something to do with it but on the other hand I also grew up dealing with poop from goats, pigs, sheep and chicken and I would say that horse poop is the least bad smelling poop. It's not pleasant but I don't think it's so bad it would ruin a carriage ride.", "Oh, no, no. Other way around. Herbivore poop is *nasty*.", "It really isn't bad, the daughter is being super special and super dramatic. I started riding as an adult city girl with very little animal exposure and it really isn't off putting even when you first encounter it. We often have non-equestrians around (including very young children and babies) and no one even mentions it, never mind nearly puking.

OP insisted on doing the hygiene equivalent making them eat their lunch off a public toilet seat, and daughter was reasonably upset and confused.", "Here\u2019s the difference between that experience and what might have been funny with her friends - her friends likely wouldn\u2019t have forced her. The daughter had good judgment and OP ignored her. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating to know better, be overruled and then be the one who suffers the consequences. In my 30s now and I\u2019d be annoyed af with OP for not just listening when I said no, let\u2019s sit in the back.", "I agree. Source was a teenage girl many years ago", ">Jesus Christ, has the girl never been around a horse? Yeaaa, they void themselves. Like, duh.\n\nDid you read the OP? Because this is exactly what OP's daughter warned for, which OP then ignored, and it was just as OP's daughter said.", "Both is/can be true\n\nHorses have their own destinctiv smell imo and even that can be uncomfortable for some people. Horseshit, while not being the most putrid thing there is, is still shit.\n\nNow think, how bad shit of several (I would guess 4+) horses can smell, just because there is so much of it.", "\"I've never heard of this being a problem from horse people.\"\n\n\"Horse people\" are mostly accustomed to the smell of horseshit. Horse people love horses and shoveling lots of horseshit is usually part of the deal.\n\nI like to ride occasionally but I'm not a horse person and wouldn't jump in the front seat because I'm adverse to the smell of horse farts & shit.\n\nBut that's probably just my weak stomach.", "I mean, dry horse shit is okay. When it first comes out of the horse it's gross, though.", "Horse farts are probably on the tamer end of the scale because they don\u2019t eat foods that caused really noxious smells (as opposed to carnivores and omnivores).  It\u2019s what rural folks might call \u2018a good country smell.\u2019 Their poop is definitely less offensive than meat eating animals, and more solid than cattle (which do stink to high heaven, OMG).  It\u2019s also excellent for your rose bushes - well rotted horse manure is highly prized by gardeners. But it\u2019s very much a your mileage may vary scenario, and they do fart a lot because of the amount of fibre in their diet.", "It\u2019s like a sack that hangs under the tail and catches the crap.", "It's more of a sack that catches the poop so it doesn't  end up on the road.", "Yeah they use them when they take horses into cities that have strict cleanup rules, it makes it worse than them just pooping because they are walking around with it in an open bag for the rest of the time", "The smell itself is most definitely not a big deal to any sort of rider, especially not to cavalry.
