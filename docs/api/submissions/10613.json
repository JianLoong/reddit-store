Sitting in back could have also been worse than expected where you would be saying \"I told you so\" after only hearing chatter of other people and only seeing other people to the point where you're just in a moving crowded room.\n\n\nPeople are saying you were dismissing what your daughter was saying, but she was \"dismissing\" what you were saying  Sometimes there is no \"right\" person or answer. You just have to make a choice and go with it. It was only an hour, no one got hurt, and this story will be more fun to repeat than a normal carriage ride.", "Okay wait hold on\n\n> She said \"a better view of what, the horses' butts? Don't they fart and crap as they walk?\" But what's the point of a horse-drawn carriage far away from the horses?\n\nSo *you agreed she was right*, and you *actively decided* that you and your daughter should huff horse ass anyway?  And you thought that *that was the point* of horse drawn carriages?!  If this was about a date people'd be asking you if that was some kind of fetish.  YTA", "Everyone say Yta must have great fathers if I even tried this mine would pop me so I was gonna say Nta \n\nEdit: stop acting like I\u2019m saying not hitting your child isn\u2019t the bare minimum.", "YTA for forcing her to sit behind shitting horses for an HOUR", "YTA.  It can't possibly have been a surprise to you that horses are gassy and take shits. Why did you have to sit up front?  Why did you need privacy on a public carriage ride?", "YTA I can't say I've ever seen people sit in the front like that. and your daughter had good reasons for not wanting to.  You should have listened to her.", "This reminds me of that Seinfeld episode \ud83d\ude02", "YTA", "YTA, How could you possibly be surprised she was mad when she tried to tell you she didn't want to sit there numerous times and you just ignored her? That's like saying you are surprised your thumb hurts because all you did was hit it with a hammer. Of course she was mad, she was right about why she didn't want to sit there. The exact thing she predicted happened, and you were \"amused\" by her discomfort.\n\nIf I were your daughter this would be the last time I agreed to do anything with you for a while. You owe her a big apology.", "You're an ass(hole). And the fact that you don't see how you're actions were wrong and dismissive of her feelings makes me question if you're fit to be a father in the first place", "YTA for invalidating your daughters feelings, strong arming her into sitting up front, and not staying home when you have a cold", "YTA. How hard is it to listen to your daughter?", "YTA\n\nIf you or your daughter don't like horses -- their smell, noise, or the way they fart and crap while working, **don't do activities in which horses are working for you.**\n\nI think you're both AHs for your attitude toward animals who are working (strapped and buckled in pulling a huge cart filled with people on hard city streets) for your amusement.", "YTA were these seats cheaper? no? then why not ride like the lord of the manor? the princess? You put her in the servants' seats and she knew what they were. a horse drawn ride has a grace and charm and the clop of hoofs, no one, unless they have a weird fetish, wants the view of equine bodily functions.", "Why are you asking something you should know?  YTA.  No one wants to ride up there with the coachman, that is the point of a **carriage** ride.", "YTA You should have listened to your daughter, she was right.", "You're the father of a teenage (technically an adult) daughter. Good luck doing ANYTHING right.  Lol.  YTA. She was right and you were wrong. Take your punches, apologize and try to be a cool dad, man! (Impossible!!!  Lol)", "Wait, so you made her sit up front for what reason exactly? Did you need to be alone so you could masturbate furiously to the sound of farting horses? I am so flummoxed by the first part of the story. \n\nSeriously ... *why did you insist she sit there*? If you thought it was such a better seat, why didn't you sit up there and let her sit where she wanted? You are so weird! \n\nOh, and by the way, YTA. It just makes no sense that you would randomly decide to order her to sit where she didn't want to sit, and then laugh when she's made miserable by the exact thing she said would happen.", "YTA\n\nThe experience of riding in a horse-drawn carriage is the body not the driver's bench.\n\n1. it was likely less comfortable 2) it was clearly a smelly, visually distasteful experience.\n\nAnd you laughed at her about it.\n\n~~Tue~~", "YTA, Go say sorry for being a rude parent and I hope to god this was a one time thing", "You made her do something as an adult she said she wouldn't enjoy, and then acted surprised when she didn't enjoy it.  YTA, the situation is a load of horse shit.", "YTA - plus you will probably be back in two years asking if  you're TA for your daughter going LC with you.", "NTA. You chose the front seat, because you didn't think it would be a big deal. Now, having experienced it yourself, you understand the whole thing better, and will probably choose the back seat if you do it again. All you have to do is explain to your daughter that you don't know everything, just because you're a parent, and you were pretty horrified, just like she was. It won't kill you to apologize, even though it wasn't intentional. It also doesn't sound like your daughter has a great sense of humor, and she needs to learn how to let things go.", "YTA. Why do you need \"privacy\" in a public place? Why are you so concerned with other people \"bothering\" you at a public event? You didn't even ask your daughter if the seats you chose, which were out of the norm, were ok to her. Do you always go through life just expecting her to go along with whatever YOU want, soothing YOUR anxieties? Once she made it clear she didn't want to sit there, you should have changed seats if you don't have a good reason, and you offered no good reasons in your post as to why you insisted on THOSE seats. You sound like you don't care about your daughter at all.", "You sound like a fairly inconsiderate person (and parent). Your daughter thought this would be a fun activity. She told you that the proximity to the horses would be unpleasant and clearly communicated she wanted to sit elsewhere. You forced her to go through an unpleasant experience and thought it was funny. \n\nIn what world are you not an asshole? YTA", "NTA. It wasn't like you knew what would happen and now know not to do it again. That's how life works lol. She could have moved if she really wanted to and what if the bad hadn't happened and she'd enjoyed it?", "Nobody has a sense of humor anymore. \n\nI'm the wrong one to ask because I would have gotten a huge kick out of the situation and I would have wanted to see the horse too.\n\nI don't think you are an AH and I think your daughter is a little snotty, but not an AH.\n\nI wish you could both see the humor and laugh about it, but she will be angry about it and bring it up time and time again probably. I'd just say, \"Sorry you didn't enjoy it. I'll try to make it up to you next time.\" and hope she drops it. A carriage ride isn't cheap so I'm sorry you wasted so much money.", "NTA - but the carriage owner shouldn't feed the horses beeferinos.", "NTA but maybe you should have let her sit where ever she wanted.", "Yeah, I can kind of understand the \"I'm paying so I got final say\" thing.  \n\nBut the daughter was right, you were wrong.  Instead of saying, 'My bad' you found her discomfort enjoyable.  A simple, \"wow you were right, that was worse than I thought\" would've go a long way towards not being an AH but you didn't do that.\n\nYTA", "Those horses are treated terribly. YTA for contributing to it.", "Honestly I couldn't even say the daughter is overreacting. She wanted the fun of a horse drawn carriage tour. Instead she got to spend an hour watching the horses poop and fart on her. She told OP it was a bad idea. She protested it from the very start. Her warnings were ignored. Her feelings were ignored. Yeah I could understand how that bad of an hour can ruin your night. And then OP didn't just ignore her feelings, they invalidated them. Of course that would still be upsetting less than 24 hours later.", "How in the world is she overreacting??", "She needed a good chuckle, apparently. Obviously the best way to do that is to make her daughter dry heave, that's just good parenting. /s", "Also a horse owner - gagging is an extreme overreaction unless she has some kind of diagnosed sensitivity to smells. Horse shit is far less offensive than many other odors I encounter every day living in a city. OP and her daughter both sound like a challenge, honestly", "Had to scroll depressingly far down to get to this reasonable response. It's a shame the daughter didn't have fun, but to still be sulking about it and not make the best of things?", "How is being angry and having her appetite  ruined by smelling horse farts and poop and entire carriage ride over reacting when she was upclose to it when she  already  said she did not want to be? Where did she have a dramatic response  to something so disgusting and foul?", "Bullying behavior is behavior that continues over and over again, not a one off situation. OP can be accused of not listening, but not of bullying.", "I kinda enjoy coming home from the barn and smelling like horse. It's a nice, earthy smell.", "I'm on the same page! I own a horse and spend most of my free time out at the barn and I just can't stop laughing at people acting like the smell of horse poop is somehow an apocalyptic experience? Hahahaha.", "Totally agree!!!", "Your reasoning for nta is that it didn\u2019t escalate to physical abuse??", "Oh sure, OP is laughing so hard. Why isn't the stepdaughter laughing? Doesn't she matter? Or is it fine because OP found it funny.", "He's an asshole because it didn't have to turn out badly. He forced it to be that way", "Someone knew it would happen, and told him that it would happen.", "[removed]", "It depends, you have to look at what they have the horse tacked up with. I volunteered for a barn that offered cart driving to special needs children and did carriage rides at fundraisers. There are pieces of tack that do hurt the horses and are used for aesthetic but there is a safe way to carriage drive.", "Meh depends. We have a festival like that and there are horse carriage rides done by local farmers. The very well treated horses are not suffering from walking around town with jingle bells on for 2 days twice a year.", "He didn't ask if he was an a h for that, those are your personal feelings but don't contribute to him being the a h here.", "That really depends. In NYC yes. The couple in my tiny hometown who had Clydesdales for eventing and did occasional rides? The horses are fine.", "And then what would have happened?  What would the ramifications of that choice be?", "Pretty sure having your face pressed directly to the horses ass, including the position and duration of the treatment, is a major factor", "18-year-olds are seniors in high school. They may be adults in the law\u2019s eyes, but most parents (and high school seniors) still behave as though they are kids. If your mom tells you to do something, you may complain, but you do it.", "The daughter is overreacting. This was an hour ride so the horses wouldn't have pooped more than once each. Also: isn't the point of a carriage ride partly to see the horses? If you don't want to see horses, drive a car. \n\nAlso, I fully thought the daughter in question was under 12. I just saw she's 18. So this is an adult who spent her carriage ride dramatically gagging and complaining about the gross animals *in front of the driver.*\n\nIt sounds like the daughter didn't want to go on the carriage ride at all. Parent shouldn't have forced the issue.\n\nESH", "I like the smell of horses and don\u2019t find their manure gross, but people who don\u2019t hang out in barns or farms shouldn\u2019t be expected to have the same opinion.", "I gotta say as another horse owner...this thread is hysterical. Someone compared having to sit there as being forced to \"eat lunch off a public toilet seat.\" I just can't, I'm over here chuckling about the dramatics here. Like, OP went for a horse drawn carriage ride and was surprised that the horses behaved like...horses? Bahahahaha. I never realized horse poop was so offensive to non-horse people, lol.", "Everyone has different triggers. My parents are helping my sister toilet train her toddler. I live across the country and I nearly had to pull over because they were talking about it on the phone and I started involuntarily retching. Not telling in great detail but enough for me to know what he was trying to do as we were talking. For some of us, there isn\u2019t a lot needed to make us sick and it\u2019s not always consistent.", "I agree!  I love the smell of horses in the sunshine!", "Nah my reasoning was that he quite literally didn\u2019t do anything wrong. And I didn\u2019t even answer the question    I said my thoughts before reading the comments. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole I think that he should\u2019ve thought more abt it. It\u2019s not like he meant to do that to her so calling him an ass when others do so much worse is just stupid to me", "had his hand in the horse's guts squeezing the farts out himself", "Huh?", " \n\nThe OP insisted on the hygiene equivalent of eating their lunch off a public toilet seat and the girl was justifiably upset and confused.", "Horses don't belong in cities.", "Same in my area. They're local pets and working horses and very well treated.", "He can be an asshole for a bunch of reasons.\nI'm happy to hear the horse shit in his face for an hour.", "Why do you think they would have only pooped once each? They don't poop everything out all at once. It could happen several times. And they also fart. Seeing horses is delightful. Being right behind their asses, not as much. Which is why carriages tend to put a bit of space between travelers and horses.\n\nFar more likely the driver's internal reaction was wondering why the hell the damn parent decided to sit there in the first place. The driver is well aware their animals poop and fart and that those not used to it can have some serious reactions. So might be slightly amused over the complaints. But also again be baffled at what the hell is wrong with OP.", "You are grossly underestimating how frequently horses poop", "The point of a carriage ride is to ride in the carriage, not up close and personal with the horses. And it was OP who stated that the horses were pooping and passing gas more than usual, NOT the daughter.", "The point of a carriage ride is to pretend you\u2019re in pride and prejudice and look out the windows, not to sit in front with the help.", "Carriages don\u2019t do well in mud. So I guess we should just ban all the horse drawn rides.", "Agreed."]}
