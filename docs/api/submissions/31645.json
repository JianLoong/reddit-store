Why was taking the taxi so important to him? Did he have an injury that night that made walking difficult? And why was having you pay for him specifically so important to him? Is his family struggling financially? Does he need a part time job? Is it his habit to ask whoever he thinks is the richest person in the group to cover him? Does he consider you a closer friend that everyone else? Or on other the other hand does he resent you for some reason? \n\nMaybe it\u2019ll turn out that there\u2019s something going on that caused him to act like an asshole.
