The class is hard, and a lot of work, but all the work is for a reason. On the first day of school in September my teacher assigned projects that would be due on the first of December. That gave us 3 months to do it. These projects were a one pager, an assignment analyzing a book, and a book for us to read in our own. Pride and Prejudice, the book, came with 3 assignments to complete as you read, I started early and finished both projects in November. \n\nA new girl joined my group yesterday, let\u2019s call her Bella(16f). When my teacher assigned a project based on Pride and Prejudice, I talked about the project with my group and asked how far everyone was with the book. Bella piped in and said she didn\u2019t even read the book, laughed, and admitted to using Chat GPT on the assignments for the book AND the one pager. We already had a project in the past with an old group, which one girl did no work and left me and my friend Ella to do all the work. So to say I was pissed was an understatement. I refuse to do all the work with my friend Ella again. \n\nTrying to work it out, I asked Bella if she would be able to read the book and work on the project as she does. She refused and said that she does not wanna read the book, and she\u2019ll figure out another way to do the work. I talked to Ella, and although we both like the new girl as a person, we agreed to tell the instructor about her use of AI to do the work, as that is the only way we could get access to an extension.\n\nI ranted to my friend about needing to rat Bella out, and they got upset at me, calling me an asshole and saying that I \u201cdon\u2019t know her home life and what she has to deal with\u201d. I tried explaining my side of the story, expressing that I also have a busy life and other honors classes and won\u2019t have time to do a five person project between me and Ella in the same time frame as everyone else. They reminded me that if I ratted Bella out, there\u2019s a chance she could get kicked out of this class and get in trouble with the school, as we have a strict no cheating or AI policy. She could be kicked out of her sports, extracurriculars, or other honors classes as well.\n\nSo Reddit, would I be the AH if I reported her?\n\nEDIT: Some people are confused on why her use of AI is relevant. She used AI as a way to avoid reading the book needed. Without reading the book, she has no way of doing the project based on it. When I mentioned this, she said she\u2019ll just use AI for her portion. The reason I mentioned the AI part is to show how she avoided the work before, and will continue to do so, which will affect my group needing to pick up her slack.", "created_utc": 1701786240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bd2up/wibta_if_i_ratted_a_girl_out_in_my_class_for/", "score": 796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our newest project requires knowledge of the book, so her lack of experience with the book jeopardizes our newest project, which can affect mine and my groups grade.

It Bella doesn\u2019t want to take the class seriously, that\u2019s on her. The minute someone is cheating on a GROUP PROJECT is the minute it becomes your problem, and I feel that you\u2019re more than justified in telling your professor.

She needs to learn to make things work with the cards she's dealt.", "no you wouldent be the AH. she has made her bed and now has to lie in it. if she goes to University/collage and trys to pull this stunt then the school could also come down harder on her. also if it is a group project then it could effect your and the others in your groups grades. you really need to speek up.  also i could be wrong but AI pulls info from other souces so it could also lead to plagerisum.", "NTA but lol AP class and assignment is ONE PAGE?

It is banned by the school. Secondly, and to piggyback off my first part, there's a risk of you getting in trouble. Let's say she uses AI for her portion.

I personally wouldn't report her to your instructor, but instead I would talk to the instructor and cite work ethic concerns as a reason for not wanting to get grouped with them in later projects.", "i don't necessarily think you owe her anything so my vote is NTA, but id first look into other ways to handle the situation, and only go to the teacher as a last resort. \n\nsome other ways to handle it could be asking the teacher for an extension by providing another excuse (illness, extenuating circumstances, idk you can brainstorm). you can also go to the girl first and tell her that you do not want AI used on your project and if she uses AI you will tell the teacher -- don't go around her, wait until your hand is forced. really present it as a your hands are tied situation, not a threat. also offer to work on it with her (share notes, meet up to do work at the same time, watch the movies, sparknotes, etc). if she still refuses, that's when you tell the teacher", "Mind your own business.", "Ahhh dude what no don't snitch like why would u these tools are meant to help ppl and ur a random junior in high-school high-school doesn't matter all tht much but when ur in high-school it's ur entire life and u can't see that far like u really are gonna snitch on some girl because why ? She's working smarter not harder and she clearly doesn't intend to leave her portion blank u just don't like the way it will get done so what slack are u having to pick up??? None? Clearly it's never been flagged tht she uses AI or Chat GPT so it shouldn't really matter and if it's found this time she again get the blame/consequences group projects are just meant to get done no matter how u get it done they are done and often times u can leave an entire section blank due to a bad partner and explain the teacher won't care ur way too wound up maybe cause ur an AP student I was too and tht shit was stressful so I'd say relax see her work first before u go assuming she will do nothing at all then talk to her like a normal person if u find error in her work and let her fix the mistakes made by a machine and move on with ur life this isn't gonna matter when ur much older and I also agree with the friend who said u don't know her home like I didn't have a great one and I know plenty others who didn't either and we almost had no time or money for homework so we had to find alternate ways to all the poster boards and long projects so maybe just leave her alone as long as she gets the work done it shouldn't matter how she gets it done", "NTA, cheaters suck.

First and foremost, it undermines the purpose of education, which is to acquire knowledge and skills through genuine effort and engagement. When someone cheats, they miss out on the opportunity to learn and develop essential critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.\n\nAdditionally, cheating can create an unfair advantage over classmates who choose to complete assignments honestly. This not only diminishes the value of grades but can also erode trust within the academic community. When individuals use AI or other resources to circumvent the learning process, it can lead to a lack of intellectual integrity.\n\nMoreover, academic institutions and employers value honesty and integrity.

It's essential to understand that the real goal of education is not just to obtain high grades but to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, which cheating ultimately prevents.", "Informed view.", "Audiobooks exist for a reason, they are a great alternative if you are unable to focus on a page.", "As someone who skated his way through high school and is doing great as an adult, my view is also informed.\n\nNothing wrong with skating by.

With that being said, it\u2019s a failure on your teachers\u2019 parts, it seems, for not making you want to connect more to the material you were being taught.

Instances like this are a reflection of character and it really isn\u2019t that serious if she were to have a genuine conversation about how she\u2019s unengaged with the material and doesn\u2019t want it to reflect badly on the other members.

I\u2019m not trying to tell anyone how to live their lives just provide my perspective from a more ethical viewpoint when it comes to academic dishonesty.", "I\u2019m not gonna read that. \n\nJust like in school, I\u2019ll just skate by after skimming it a little. \n\nWhich is fine.", "Good luck in life\u2026 ha.", "NTA.  Yes, she may suffer consequences, but realize that this is not your responsibility.  The consequences are because she did something wrong.  \n\nAs for ethics, cheating is not just something that impacts her.  Consider...\n\nThis is a group project, so if she does it and gets caught and you said nothing, then you and your friend could be in trouble too.\n\nAlso, if she cheats and gets she doesn't earn, then she may take a place in university or college that she also didn't earn.  And those places are finite.  So if she takes a place she wouldn't have otherwise gotten, that means someone else didn't get that place.  The same is true for other things like awards, scholarships, etc.  And hey what about this class anyway? Aren't AP spots limited too, so she is taking the spot of someone who would potentially put in the work and not cheat and who may need that credit.\n\nAnd the home life argument isn't relevant.  Having a tough life (if she even does - this is just speculative) doesn't mean you don't have to put in the work.  If there is some circumstance that should be considered in terms of academic accommodation, then she needs to raise that with the teacher or administration rather than just cheat and not do the work.\n\nAll in all, seems ethical to report her, in my view.  Yeah, some kids are always going to say don't snitch.  Don't listen to them. Do the right thing.  High school ends.  But you're becoming the person you're going to be for the rest of your life.

I'm a Comp Sci major working as a software developer, and yet in high school I had to write pages about 16th century poetry and act like I gave a singular fuck. I did this so that I could get accepted by a good university and get a degree, so that people who work in HR and have no actual skills read my resume and think \"oh that's a good school, she must be a good candidate\". In reality, the instruction at my top 20 school was no better than some random state college or even YouTube. It's all a big farce. \n\nGive her a fair share of the work, and let her know that you expect it to be done right, but you don't care how she does it. If it's not satisfactory (e.g. false info), tell her and have her do it again. *Advise* her to read the book. If it happens a second time, then you can go to the teacher and say that she's not pulling her weight, and stop there. What'll probably happen is that she will get talked to and/or receive a lower grade, but she won't get expelled or otherwise fucked over. \n\nRegarding your own life - by all means keep doing well in school, but I'd suggest you think about how much being a good student affects your identity. I knew people who were very good students - 3.8 gpa in chemical engineering programs - who ended up working for $16/hr at Staples because their whole identity was centered around being a good student, and when that ended they were completely lost.", "YTA\n\nIt isn't your place to bring up anything about the AI. Even after reading your edit, your logic is flawed. She could read the book, be able to participate in your group and still not do the work that she needed to turn in herself.

It isn't your place to worry or care about her use of AI. \n\nHowever... My suggestion is that you will need to get used to this. Far before ChatGPT existed there was group work and often the people who wanted to do well were carrying the group. The real success is when you can still get them to complete work for the group by being a leader in the group, but the normal success is just making sure the work is done. Worry about you and your success not if that success might tangentially help someone else out. \n\n(In fact, I would suggest you get good at using the AI as an assistant in your work as it will make you a much better worker in the future... don't let it do your work, but learn to work with it as a tool. It's like being able to do a lot more math with a calculator. I do a ton of math for work, I could do it in my head or on paper, but I don't... I use a calculator or create spreadsheets that do it... when it gets really complicated I often use ChatGPT and similar LLMs to help with that generation, knowing how to use them matters. Likewise, if I am writing a procedure manual or policy I will start with ChatGPT giving me initial ideas and modify from there; \"provide an outline for a policy manual for X type of business\" \"Provide a sample attendance policy for X type of business\" In no case do I just take the result and I am done, but it is a fantastic starting point.

You\u2019re right that this would really screw up her life, and it sounds like she\u2019s a nice person that just makes some questionable choices. It\u2019s a lot easier to do when you have an incredibly powerful AI tool right at your fingertips. It\u2019s very tempting and that temptation wreaks havoc on teenagers with poor impulse control. The fact that she causally revealed her usage of it as a joke indicates that she doesn\u2019t understand the serious academic repercussions, despite likely having it drilled through your head by now. And your fellow students are right, there\u2019s no way to tell what\u2019s going on in her personal life. Plus, if you report her, you will automatically be outed as a \u201csnitch\u201d.

Express to her that you don\u2019t dislike her as a person, but by telling you that she has forced you to choose between keeping her secret and putting your own academic careers at risk, which is a choice you don\u2019t want to make but you will have to if she chooses to use ChatGPT again.
