The class is hard, and a lot of work, but all the work is for a reason. On the first day of school in September my teacher assigned projects that would be due on the first of December. That gave us 3 months to do it. These projects were a one pager, an assignment analyzing a book, and a book for us to read in our own. Pride and Prejudice, the book, came with 3 assignments to complete as you read, I started early and finished both projects in November. \n\nA new girl joined my group yesterday, let\u2019s call her Bella(16f). When my teacher assigned a project based on Pride and Prejudice, I talked about the project with my group and asked how far everyone was with the book. Bella piped in and said she didn\u2019t even read the book, laughed, and admitted to using Chat GPT on the assignments for the book AND the one pager. We already had a project in the past with an old group, which one girl did no work and left me and my friend Ella to do all the work. So to say I was pissed was an understatement. I refuse to do all the work with my friend Ella again. \n\nTrying to work it out, I asked Bella if she would be able to read the book and work on the project as she does. She refused and said that she does not wanna read the book, and she\u2019ll figure out another way to do the work. I talked to Ella, and although we both like the new girl as a person, we agreed to tell the instructor about her use of AI to do the work, as that is the only way we could get access to an extension.\n\nI ranted to my friend about needing to rat Bella out, and they got upset at me, calling me an asshole and saying that I \u201cdon\u2019t know her home life and what she has to deal with\u201d. I tried explaining my side of the story, expressing that I also have a busy life and other honors classes and won\u2019t have time to do a five person project between me and Ella in the same time frame as everyone else. They reminded me that if I ratted Bella out, there\u2019s a chance she could get kicked out of this class and get in trouble with the school, as we have a strict no cheating or AI policy. She could be kicked out of her sports, extracurriculars, or other honors classes as well.\n\nSo Reddit, would I be the AH if I reported her?\n\nEDIT: Some people are confused on why her use of AI is relevant. She used AI as a way to avoid reading the book needed. Without reading the book, she has no way of doing the project based on it. When I mentioned this, she said she\u2019ll just use AI for her portion. The reason I mentioned the AI part is to show how she avoided the work before, and will continue to do so, which will affect my group needing to pick up her slack.", "created_utc": 1701786240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bd2up/wibta_if_i_ratted_a_girl_out_in_my_class_for/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our newest project requires knowledge of the book, so her lack of experience with the book jeopardizes our newest project, which can affect mine and my groups grade.

It Bella doesn\u2019t want to take the class seriously, that\u2019s on her. The minute someone is cheating on a GROUP PROJECT is the minute it becomes your problem, and I feel that you\u2019re more than justified in telling your professor.

She needs to learn to make things work with the cards she's dealt.", "no you wouldent be the AH. she has made her bed and now has to lie in it. if she goes to University/collage and trys to pull this stunt then the school could also come down harder on her. also if it is a group project then it could effect your and the others in your groups grades. you really need to speek up.  also i could be wrong but AI pulls info from other souces so it could also lead to plagerisum.", "NTA but lol AP class and assignment is ONE PAGE?

It is banned by the school. Secondly, and to piggyback off my first part, there's a risk of you getting in trouble. Let's say she uses AI for her portion.

She's working smarter not harder and she clearly doesn't intend to leave her portion blank u just don't like the way it will get done so what slack are u having to pick up??? None? Clearly it's never been flagged tht she uses AI or Chat GPT so it shouldn't really matter and if it's found this time she again get the blame/consequences group projects are just meant to get done no matter how u get it done they are done and often times u can leave an entire section blank due to a bad partner and explain the teacher won't care ur way too wound up maybe cause ur an AP student I was too and tht shit was stressful so I'd say relax see her work first before u go assuming she will do nothing at all then talk to her like a normal person if u find error in her work and let her fix the mistakes made by a machine and move on with ur life this isn't gonna matter when ur much older and I also agree with the friend who said u don't know her home like I didn't have a great one and I know plenty others who didn't either and we almost had no time or money for homework so we had to find alternate ways to all the poster boards and long projects so maybe just leave her alone as long as she gets the work done it shouldn't matter how she gets it done", "NTA, cheaters suck.

First and foremost, it undermines the purpose of education, which is to acquire knowledge and skills through genuine effort and engagement. When someone cheats, they miss out on the opportunity to learn and develop essential critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.\n\nAdditionally, cheating can create an unfair advantage over classmates who choose to complete assignments honestly. This not only diminishes the value of grades but can also erode trust within the academic community. When individuals use AI or other resources to circumvent the learning process, it can lead to a lack of intellectual integrity.\n\nMoreover, academic institutions and employers value honesty and integrity. Cheating can have long-term consequences, damaging one's reputation and credibility. It's essential to understand that the real goal of education is not just to obtain high grades but to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, which cheating ultimately prevents.", "Informed view.", "Audiobooks exist for a reason, they are a great alternative if you are unable to focus on a page.", "As someone who skated his way through high school and is doing great as an adult, my view is also informed.\n\nNothing wrong with skating by.

With that being said, it\u2019s a failure on your teachers\u2019 parts, it seems, for not making you want to connect more to the material you were being taught. I think overall things like this matter because teachers would generally prefer even a half-assed response coming from the heart rather than one generated by AI. If Bella in this story were to say \u201chey I am sorry I\u2019m not really understanding this book\u2026 I joined late so I\u2019m behind\u2026 please help\u201d that would\u2019ve been the best thing to do. I\u2019m not saying she should strive for an A, but just try as much as she can. Instances like this are a reflection of character and it really isn\u2019t that serious if she were to have a genuine conversation about how she\u2019s unengaged with the material and doesn\u2019t want it to reflect badly on the other members.
