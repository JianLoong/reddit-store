First of all **\"NO\"** means **\"NO\"** regardless on whether the person saying this is female or male.  I would text back and tell her and her friends this.  Unwanted kissing is a form of sexual assault.  You tried to be nice and lie but she tried to embarrass you in front of your peers by accusing you of being gay, so you had no option but to tell the truth.  She brought your embarrassing statement to her upon herself.\n\nNot saying being gay is wrong or embarrassing but if you were and she tried to out you before you were ready is a massive AH move on her part.", "NTA\n\nShe, nor anyone else, is entitled to any part of your body unless it's voluntary on your part.  She was making unwanted advances and decided to try and belittle you publicly because what, you didn't reciprocate?  Let this be a lesson to her.  You tried to be polite by sidestepping the issue (I have g/f.)  She's the one who escalated the situation.  Consequences of her own actions - she ended up belittling herself.  She's an asshole.", "You phrased your title poorly. It should have read \u201cAITA for telling the truth about why I refused a girl\u2019s persistent sexual advances after I clearly said no?\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but that girl sure was. \n\nShe wouldn't take no for an answer, so you told a \"white lie\" to get her to back off without embarrassing or insulting her. Then she kept pushing and tried to humiliate you into doing what she wanted, like a controlling, predatory AH. Nope, at that point, she deserved complete and utter bluntness with no sugar coating. She and her friends that support that kind of BS are AHs to be avoided.", "NTA.  She sounds stalker level creepy", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why she called you out for lying though. I\u2019d have been so embarrassed if I was in her position and found out someone lied to avoid me. How did she expect that conversation to go?", "NTA.

That isn\u00b4t OK, she was harassing you. \n\nSo she got embarrassed instead for her stinky breath, but she should have been embarrassed first for harassing you.", "NTA- she wanted to make a scene and decided to ask if you were gay making it as if it was problem and asked why you lied in front of others to embarrass you for entertainment and then when you told the truth and she became the laughing matter you\u2019re all of a sudden an A-hole? No. You told the truth and you tried to be nice and cover it up with a white lie to avoid an embarrassment for her, but instead she felt so entitled to kiss you and degrade you she deserved the truth. Tell your friends that she is the a hole for what she did and that you tried to cover it up and then she is the one who made a scene and demanded to know why so you told the truth.

You didn't consent to kiss her, that should have been the end of the conversation, period. \n\nSituations like this are part of the reason I really think we need to stop making the conversation around consent so gendered. Some people really do seem to think that straight men give their consent by default, which is honestly so dehumanizing. She is majorly the AH for feeling entitled to kissing you without your consent.\n\nPlus, it sounds like you were trying to be nice and not point out her bad breath, and you only pointed it out because she was so unwilling to accept your no. So please don't feel bad in the slightest, she humiliated herself.", "Honestly, NTA. \n\nShe should absolutely not have pressured you to kiss her, that is not OK. Nor should she have called you out in front of everyone. \n\nHowever, I do feel like you could have handled the situation a little better. Obviously lying and saying you had a girlfriend was a bit unnecessary. When she called you out, you could have told her that you have no obligation to kiss her, or you could have simply walked away from the situation. You could have pulled her to the side and spoken to her about her breath, rather than calling her out the way she called out you.", "ESH sounds young and immature. You could've taken the high road but chose to meet her at her level.", "Obviously NTA.\n\nSorry that your hangout was pretty much ruined from the get-go with all her unwanted attention, I hope you at least had *some* fun.", "She embarrassed herself she tried to put you on the spot and call you out in front of everybody and got a dose of her own medicine!... NTA", "ESH.  Yeah, ya all did wrong things.", "Imagine a man repeatedly trying to kiss a girl who wasn't interested. She lies to get rid of him and says she has a boyfriend. So he goes and asks all of her friends and instead of thinking she isn't interested in me, he calls her into a room full of people and demands an explanation. \n\nThis woman got what she deserved for harassing you. NTA", "True", "I feel like if a guy rejected me for a kiss and I found out he lied about having a girlfriend, I would be very clear on him not wanting me. She was asking to get her feelings hurt by questioning why he would lie about having a girlfriend, like if someone lies about being taken it\u2019s clear that they aren\u2019t interested, why push them for an answer? \n\nNot sure if she was just totally baffled by the notion that someone wasn\u2019t attracted to her, or felt super duper entitled to him as he isn\u2019t \u2018taken\u2019, either way, very very icky behaviour.", "Kinda feel bad thou.... But no she deserved it", "I didn't know how to tell her so I lied and hoped she would back off.. But yeah I shouldn't have", "I mean, her level is trying to force him to kiss her. I'd say sexual assault is a bit worse than humiliating her. And also, if he really was gay, she'd be straight up outing him. That's just a shitty thing to do.", "So someone should feel like they have to leave a group hangout because one person chose to try and assault them? \nThen what about next time they are in the same room and it perhaps happens again? OP should run again? \n\nAnything OP would have done would have \"embarrassed her\" \nHe told her no in different ways that should have been it. \n\nIf he had yelled into the room, \"Please stop trying to kiss me!\" She would cry. \nIf he tried to get a friend to tell her to back off, that would have been \"humiliating,\" too.\nOne person shouldn't have felt like running because one person can't respect boundaries.", "She absolutely deserved it. She was trying to embarrass you and she found out quick that it was really her. Maybe she will brush her teeth and floss or whatever she needs to do for herself to fix that.", ">I didn't know how to tell her so I lied and hoped she would back off.. \n\nDon't sweat this Joeyniles9, women have done and sometimes still do this to men as to not hurt their feelings.  You were trying to keep your boundary but be empathic at the same time.", "So that's a reason to humiliate her?", "You're making alot of assumptions. His question was whether he was the asshole because he said her breath stinks, instead of addressing the actual issue. \n\nNo one is saying he needs to runaway or do anything other then state how she is making him feel. \n\nInstead he decided to attack her. \n\nAgain, ESH.", "She lost consideration for not taking \"No\" for an answer.\nNTA", "What is her reason for trying to humiliate **him**?", "\"You could have taken the high road,\" \nWhat high road? He was being put on the spot by this girl after she had to go ask everyone, \"Is he really dating?\" Instead of taking the rejection. \n\nWhen someone keeps cornering you, yes, you just want to get out of the situation, not have several attempts of assaults, being put on the spot. \"Are you gay?\" \"Why did you say you are dating? \" Everyone's eyes are on you.\nIn the moment, he just truthfully told her the truth about why he definitely wasn't interested. \nWas it harsh? Yes. But she really did put herself in that situation, \nMost who are pressed into a corner do not exactly think logically. And plan a whole speech. \n\n\n>No one is saying he needs to runaway or do anything other then state how she is making him feel. \n^ \nWhat other truth should OP have given when it was her breath that made him dodge her? \n\"I'm not attracted to you because..... you have some traits I don't find attractive?\" \nIf a girl can't take a hint when someone keeps rejection, you then creates a scene. Would that have worked?", "So bad behavior excuses more bad behavior?", "I don't see the relevance.", "Saying how you feel isn't a planned speech. She attacked him, he attacked her back. ESH.", "Sometimes, you got to get someone to shut the hell up and sit the fuck down. She was harassing him, he stood up for himself.\nI can't believe you're seriously equating calling someone's breath bad to sexual assault.", "Is that your take?", "That is why you are wrong.", "You don't? \n\nReally? \nHitting on him all day\n\n\nTrying to kiss him\n\n\nConfronting him when he turned her down\n\n\nSo Op stooped to what level of hers- sexual harassment? \n\n\nHe was supposed to smile and take it just like women are told to? So she continues with him or someone else? \n\n\nIf you don't see the relevance, you need a refresher course on consent", "And he told her how he felt. \n\nUnless you can give a really brilliant example of what he should have said? \nGo ahead. How would you say, \"i don't want to kiss you, your breath smells\" in a polite way that would make her stop assaulting him and try force kisses. And you can't spin a lie. \nClearly, backing away from her didn't work, and neither did saying, \"I have a gf\".", "I'm not equating anything. What she did was wrong and what he did was wrong. Hence, ESH. There are other ways to stand up for yourself, such as, \"You're making me feel uncomfortable and I don't want to kiss you.\" Instead of trying to embarass her.\n\nSeems like you're a very ego-based reactor.", "I'm asking you, does bad behavior excuse more bad behavior?", "You're allowed to have an opinion. Doesn't make it fact.", "He's asking about he handled the situation. He handled it poorly and stooped to her level by trying to embarass her, just like she was trying to embarrass him.\n\nIt would've been more effective to just say that he didn't want to kiss her and she was making him feel uncomfortable.\n\nI also don't know their history. What if they had previously hooked up, or had been chatting or flirting etc.\n\nBut, I think I have my answer, you believe bad behavior is excused by other bad behavior.", "There doesn't need to be a brilliant idea.\n\n\"I didn't want to kiss you, so I told you I have a girlfriend so you would feel less rejected,\" is a perfectly fine example and everyone would've thought she was the asshole. \n\nInstead he said that she had bad breath intentionally trying to embarass her. So again, ESH.", "Yeah, but of those two offences, only one is actually a crime. And she clearly wasn't taking no for an answer. I'll admit I'm not entirely sure what you mean by \"ego-based reactor\", so I'll leave that for now.", "Is that what YOU think?", ">I also don't know their history. What if they had previously hooked up, or had been chatting or flirting etc.\n\n\n\nAnd I have my answer too. \n\nPrevious history with you is reason enough to justify this pervert", "And that right there is what i pointed out: \"Not everyone can just think up a polite way to tell someone to stop assaulting them when they are put on the spot\" \nPanic response is a thing. You are ASSUMING OP just wanted to humiliate her. When if you go by what is in the text. OP tried to get away from her more than once, was put in the spot, and now just wanted to get away again. \nIt's the same reaction as just screaming to make someone back away that's too close for personal comfort or throw a pillow if someone jump scares you.", "The question isn't which of the two offenses is worse. The question is whether he was an asshole. Yes, by intentionally trying to embarass her he is an asshole.\n\nHence, ESH", "I think you are trying to excuse his bad behavior because of hers. But that's just a guess, so I am asking if that's what you think?", "Noone is justifying anything, but previous history is relevant. Or even the context of her trying to kiss him. Was he flirting with her? Leading her on? Had hooked up before? What is the reason she tried to kiss him. Then she's embarrassed by being rebuffed by him, so tries to embarass him, then he embarrasses her?\n\nAgain, ESH.", "The question was whether he did something wrong. The answer is yes, he intentionally tried to embarass the girl.\n\nAgain, ESH.", "Okay, I disagree with you but I can see I'm not going to change your mind and I have no intention of changing my decision. I hope you have a good day.", "His behavior is warranted.  He politely rejected her multiple advances **she** took it public.  She set the precedence.  Since polite didn't stop her, he met her where she took the interactions.  She didn't accept the lie of his having a gf.  He told the truth about her bad breath.   She took the lead, he ended the dance. (The dance he wanted No part of.).", "Again, you are assuming his thought was, \"Now I have the best chance to humiliate her!\" And not \"let me get away from this nightmare\" there is a huge difference."]}
