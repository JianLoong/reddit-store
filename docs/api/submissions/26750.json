We\u2019ve been doing this every home game for about 10 years.  This is a power 5 school.  Our tailgates have grown from a few of us and beers to a full blown set up with food/tents/TV\u2019s/Games.  I organize it all and own all the stuff brought to the tailgate every week. It\u2019s a pretty open event and people come and go.  Its not unusual for people to stop by for a beer and then leave. \r  \n\r  \nThis past week, this guy with a dog came up to our tailgate.  I can\u2019t stand dogs, I bit my tongue though as some people that go don\u2019t know me all that well.  This has never happened in 10 years and never thought I\u2019d need a rule no dogs at the tailgate.  My closest friends, they know I don\u2019t like dogs.  \r  \n\r  \nSomeone that wasn\u2019t one of my closest friends but regularly see at a tailgate starts chatting with this person and pets the dog. I\u2018m watching them close as I don\u2019t want the dog present.    Not sure what was said, but it was obvious this person was invited in to the area, but they grabbed a beer from my cooler.  Then they proceed to go to the food. Before they grab anything, I yell out, Hey man, get your dog away from the food.  I tell him that I don\u2019t allow dogs at the tailgate so you gotta go.  \r  \n\r  \nHe says, Joe said it was cool.  I say if it was just you, you are good to stay, but I don\u2019t want your dog around and told him to leave.  He gets defensive and repeats Joe said it was cool.  I tell him its my beer and my food and my tailgate and you are not welcome.  I asked him to leave.  He mumbles something I couldn\u2019t here and then he audibly calls me an asshole.  He gets defensive and says he isn\u2019t causing any problems, only I am.  I told him to get out of here one more time.  He eventually moved on to somewhere else.  I got some backlash from people at the tailgate.  IDGAF.

This guy was rightfully confused and defensive but Joe is the real AH. If your friends know you don't like dogs, they should not invite people with dogs.", "Well, I think you could have been a tad more civilized about it, but you have every right to ask the guy to leave. I think Joe was the AH for randomly inviting a guy you don\u2019t know to your tailgate, without clearing it with you first. Had he done so, you could have told Joe a flat no. You are NTA, but could use a lesson in tact.", "ESH.  You were immediately hostile and aggressive for no reason other than not liking dogs.  He reacted like a jerk and you both continued to be jerks.      This could have been handled much more calmly and reasonably.", "INFO: is this area where you are at yours? or is this a parking lot/field somewhere?\n\nRegardles it seems like a pretty bold thing to just be a stranger and come up and grab a beer from a random cooler.", "To be fair, Joe's the AH.  I hate people who have NOTHING to do with an event invite others to your event.  No excuses for the dog guy other than he probably thought he WAS invited.  Maybe class it up and have lanyards and the hosts have one that say Kahuna or something.  \n\nNTA", "And if you don't give a fuck, why are you asking Reddit?", "Yeah. 10 years out of college and still gatekeeping a tailgate. Grow up man.", "Yep you are an AH. You didn\u2019t handle that with any class or basic human decency. You could have easily approached him and calmly explained the tailgate rules and that he could have Joe watch his dog away from food while he got a plate. But instead you chose to yell out and cause a scene.", "YTA and so is Joe. You because you could have handled it with more tact (and said something much sooner if it was such an issue for you) and Joe because if you have a thing against dogs, he should have known better than to say it was ok.", "NTA You don't know him and you don't like dogs, it's your food.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t tell anyone dogs weren\u2019t allowed, and you were on public property, so you have to accept that some random people are going to join in. You could have been nice about it (\u201chey, you\u2019re welcome to joint us, but I\u2019d prefer you take your dog home first.\u201d) if this was at your house, or even in a private neighborhood I could understand- but you\u2019re literally in a public parking lot. And you ever told anyone not to bring dogs? How are people supposed to know there are rules if you don\u2019t share them? He asked someone who should have known if there were restorations- what else was he supposed to do?", "PUBLIC PARKING LOT YTA. Come on man, you didn't rent or in any way own some exclusive access to this area. It was a public parking lot.", "Is this a trick question? Of course you are. I would never respect anyone who didn't like dogs, cats or other animals.", "NTA. Nope, nope, nope. I love my dog. But I hate the dog culture that has empowered people to assume their dogs are welcome everywhere. Tailgates are full of open food, unfamiliar people, and hot cooking surfaces. A dog doesn't need to be there. That being said, this is mostly on Joe.\n\nEdit: I also do not know if many people understand what a tailgate is based on the comments. For anyone who needs an explanation: It's a pre-game event usually held in the parking lot of a stadium before a game. Sometimes it is people attending the game, often times people will have a set up that quite honestly makes watching from the tailgate on a TV more fun. Yes, it is open area, but tailgaters are typically assigned areas or spots to stay within. It is common for people to walk around, chat, and maybe bum a drink or food, but it is also bad tailgate etiquette just to walk up and assume you are welcome. In my experience, it's rare to see animals at these, and when I do they belong to the person actually running the tailgate. I would also argue it's bad etiquette to invite someone without asking the host, but OP seems pretty cool with that aspect when dogs aren't involved.", "I'm going to say YTA. You were looking for a fight as soon as you saw the dog. \n\nYou could've walked up to him before he went to the food and asked him to come back without the dog. \"Joe said it was okay\" \"I'm sorry but Joe is mistaken\" \n\nSounds like you were lookong for a main character moment, and from the reaction of the other tailgaters you were ta.", "If the dog was being chill, you were the asshole. But it's your party, and you can cry if you want to.", "I\u2019m assuming it was before a CFB or NFL game? Gonna be honest, I\u2019d probably have yelled some choice words at you too.", "YTA.\n\nThere is something untrustworthy and unsavory about people who do not like dogs.", "YTA and you need therapy for your wildly weird and inflated hatred of dogs. Did you get bit as a toddler?", "YTA why are you so hyper focused on this dog thing. Did you get bit as a kid or something?", "Joe and you are both TA.", "ESH. You both acted poorly here. You could have walked up to the guy with the dog and politely explained in a calm, collected manner your reasoning. Was this a public park or parking lot? Then he had every right to be there, however, you also had the right to tell him why he should leave your section of the area. \n\nHe is AH because he accepted an invitation to a private party without getting an ok from the host. Plus, dogs are not welcome everywhere and he should know that. Just because it\u2019s outside doesn\u2019t mean your pet can be there. Unless its a LEGITIMATE service animal then those working puppies can go everywhere. However, from what you\u2019ve said it does not sound like this was the case.", "NTA. A dog near your food is gross.", "YTA - not for the no dog thing but how you handled the situation.\n\nAlso, am I the only one who pictures OP as some dude all kitted up in his *insert obligatory college* football fan gear, with a herd of cats licking him all over before he leaves for the tailgate?", "  \na tailgate is a public event  if you want your food to not go to people who have a dog at the event, that, is really kind of odd, but it is your food and beer so you can set any unreasonable restrictions on who can and cannot partake.  \n\n\nbut people will think YTA over it", "NTA\n\nSorry guy, but you have a losing game with people on reddit concerning pets. They would YTA you even if it was tearing into everything and seeming aggressive. They think dogs are iterally incapable of doing harm and should never be fear or rejected. Literally angels on earth. \n\nThey can stink, be foul and dangerous. They don't have some god given right to be in your space. You require *zero* justification for not wanting them near you or your stuff. If someone cannot immediately respect that without question, they are the asshole. \n\nUnfortunately, you'll find that's 90% of dog owners.", "YTA!", "NTA\n\nthis more of a private event in an open space (most parking lots aren't public spaces, but a few are). \n\nBut some people are too fixated on that, he showed up, took your beer, went to take your food, and you shut that down. Is there actually a guy named joe? Joe, John, Jen, are among the most common names so it's a pretty safe bet to just say that and weasel your way in. \n\n\nI wouldn't want a stranger's dog near a big pile of food either.

I can't just steal someone's food if they're eating in a public parking lot, lol. Or steal someone's car on public land.

They have stadium security- you can be arrested, fined, banned and thrown into the stadium jail cells in the security room. 12-15 people to a tiny room. Your area, vehicle and those a part of your party is the registerants responsibility. He or she can kick out whoever they want - having a phobia and not fucking with policy to get kicked out -does not matter. Also what public parking lot? You are registered to use a designated space on private property.\n\nYou\u2019re right - it\u2019s not his house \u2014it\u2019s someone else\u2019s house.

I have never seen a stranger take someone else\u2019s food unless drunk or confused where the tailgate for their people started or ended.\n\nAnd if a mistake was made never have I seen someone try to argue otherwise (unless drunk/ drunk angry)\n\nTailgating depending on the size are similar to peoples homes and several together ( friends and family tailgating together looks like a neighborhood.\n\nStranger is an asshole for arguing and his friend is an asshole for skirting policy. Depending on the stadium you have to register and provided a policy and guidelines docs or docs you have to sign. You can also be kicked out of tailgating in the future if you have something prohibited even by others. OP is not the AH but the stranger was for bringing a dog and then arguing with OP once he and his dog had to leave.", "This is not true everywhere. I live in Pittsburgh near Heinz Stadium and people just set up in parking lots, grills and all. There is no registry, it's just people hanging around vehicles in parking lots."]}
