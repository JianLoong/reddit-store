Your sister is out of line for bringing your sexuality into _anything_. \n2. Your sister was being incredibly naive and unwise if she thinks giving specific, truthful answers is wise to _anyone_ she's just met. There are smarter and more subtle ways to answer that don't involve giving a random guy personal info. \n3. You're never obligated to speak to anyone you're not comfortable speaking to, especially with social anxiety, in a social setting. \n4. If your sister is aware you have social anxiety, especially about drunk men, she was being incredibly selfish and thoughtless by continuing the situation. She may have thought it was harmless, but it wasn't harmless for you.\n\nCould you have been more polite by saying hello? Yes. Sadly, that's often viewed as an invitation, especially by drunks. But overall, NTA.", "NTA but you might have c-blocked your sister", "NTA Unfortunately, it is dangerous to talk to guys like that.

Although i understand that you have social anxiety/male issues, why does that constitute you to ignore this guy who is seemingly harmless. You're with ur sister in a public space.

You need to talk to your sister because she could have gotten herself killed.\n\nNo part of that situation was wrong because you were rude. let me make you a list of everything you sister did wrong, feel free to give it to her.\n\n1.

She walked right over your boundaries and then got mad at YOU!!!\n5. She risked both of your lives and safety in the process. Seriously there's gullible and then there's stupid.\n6. Oh and then to top it off she made it about your sexuality. Which says so much more about her then it does you.

Lots of repeat customers. I'd happily chat to one guy,  about 20 years older than me.  Friendly general conversation. Developed photos with his family in them.  In those conversations I gave out more info than I'd realised. I lived nearby and he turned up at my door one day to wish me merry Christmas or something. It was weird. And scary. He didn't seem creepy even then - just naive? I felt he didn't click how inappropriate that was. (I imagined him telling his wife later and her WTF? face!)\nThis guy your sister gave info to? Way higher risk. She's being outright stupid and blas\u00e9 about her safety. I hope it doesn't come back to bite her, but many (most) guys would assume she's interested.", "I want to point out that freezing like you did is very common in situations like you found yourself in even for people without social anxiety. Most people, but women especially, are trained from a young age to \"be polite\" and very few people are taught how to handle a drunk jerk imposing themselves on you with grace. I've always been pretty socially outgoing and \"could talk to anybody anywhere\" and I would find myself freezing in the exact same type of situations that you described. Remind me to tell you sometime about the time the extremely drunk guy planted himself next to me on the bus, tried to chat me up (he was slurring so bad I couldn't understand a word he was saying) then gave all indications that he was going to puke. The bus driver had to rescue me! What helped me was developing a \"script\" of what to say and do, and then practicing it regularly. Chat GPT can help you with some scripts and tips to get you started. My go to is usually \"I'm here to spend time with the person / people I came with. I'm not available to make new acquaintances right now.\" Your script may be different. The point is to find something that works for you and practice it until it becomes second nature. That way it is like 'muscle memory\" - when you freeze you'll be more likely to be able to access it. \n\nLastly, what your sister did was incredibly dangerous for both of you. Remember, safety **always** trumps politeness even if you have to tell your sister straight out \"Shut Up! We are leaving now!\" and then doing it (practice until it feels natural).
