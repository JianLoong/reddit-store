It is a significant amount of money and you won't get it back.  To Alex you are not a friend but a bank that they don't have to pay back.\n\nIf Alex gets upset provide them with a list of amounts owed, advise them they have to pay ALL that back before you would consider a loan of money again.  Personally I wouldn't however if you absolutely want to I'd do it on smaller scales first ie I will loan you $20 and once you have proven you can pay it back your credit allowance goes up to $50 etc.", "NTA\nYour friend can take out a personal loan at the bank or something. if the banks won't give it to them then it means they don't have the means to make repayments. You will be doing them a favour if you do offer to lend them money but do it properly. Lend them some if they are willing to put it down on paper and do it through a lawyer? You will be doing them a favour to not ask for any interest and technically granting them a loan.  If it was me urgently need money but absolutely have the intention to pay it back I would be very thankful to you and do it that way. Otherwise you know they have no intention of paying you back and is just taking advantage of your kind heart being able to get away without paying you back. Also significant amount is roughly how much?", "Only lend money when you are comfortable not getting it back. Always. Even to people that have proven they will repay you. Because no one knows what the next day will bring and how long it will take to repay.", "Definitely NTA. He has proven he can\u2019t be trusted to pay back loans from friends so it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll pay this one back.", "NTA.....\nPersonally, I never lend money. If I lend someone money, I consider it a gift and write the money off.", "If he still owes you money, then he isn\u2019t asking for a loan. He\u2019s asking you to give him your money.

Your friend is taking advantage of you and broke your trust by not paying you back. You\u2019re not obligated to be your friends personal ATM machine. \n\nIt\u2019s actually pretty audacious for him to ask you for more when he never paid you back in the first place. Run.", "NTA. *He* should have put *your* friendship above *his* own financial concerns.\n\nDude still owes you money! (He never paid you back those 'loans', right?) He's going to a *creditor* for a 'significant' amount of money.\n\nDon't be an AH to yourself. He knows how you feel (from your comment) and is using you. That's not a friend, and certainly not a decent romantic prospect. Do NOT give him more money. You will regret it.", "Agree. Lending is not a thing in my book too. It's a no or a gift. This saves lots of trouble. I would very likely to gift some if I can afford to do it to help with terminal disease. Something like that.", "Love no please don\u2019t do this to yourself!!! You are amazing this Alex doesn\u2019t deserve the wonderful human that you are.", "A good friend wouldn't put you in this position. A good friend would have paid back previous loans before asking for a new one. Yes, he is using you. You deserve better.", "Please try to untangle your feelings for alex. I bet his charming and funny and all that but he's not trustworthy and if you loan him money and then date , you'll always wonder if he's really into you or just guilt-dating you. I know it's not that simple but please try to distance yourself and find a new crush", "NTA and the fact that he didn\u2019t want to accept the alternatives you offered shows he hasn\u2019t changed and was just looking for a quick fix", "NTA\n\nAt some point you will realize that some friends in your life will give and take. And others will just take. Get rid of those that just take.", "NTA. Lots of people say don't lend money to friends but I think it's good to put trust in your friends. You did that and your friend showed he couldn't be trusted to do the right thing and pay you back. It's the right decision to not lend him money again, you helped him before and he burned you.", "NTA. If I can\u2019t afford to give money I won\u2019t lend it. And if I do give it it\u2019s on the understanding the recipient will help someone else out in the future", "They are not asking for a loan. They are asking for a donation. On that basis, can you afford it?\nNTA", "NTA, my brother asked me for money for a car once. I asked him to come up with a payment plan of how he was going to pay it back and to look at his finances to see how much he had left after bills etc. Would have made him sign a contract too. Never heard from him again.", "NTA, dont lend friends if they never pay back, why are even asking this? Please get assertiveness training", "He doesn\u2019t want other options because then he\u2019s legally responsible for paying them back (and doesn\u2019t want to) so he wants to borrow from you and never pay you back. That\u2019s just my opinion tho \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You are prioritising your friendship - if you lent him the money and he did not pay it back your friendship would be over - full stop. \n\nThe risk of losing both friendship and money is far lower by not lending him \ud83d\udcb0.", "NTA. Sounds like the kind of friend who will ALWAYS be in some sort of financial crisis, and never in a position to repay anything and would make you out to be the worst person in the world for asking him to pay you back.", "NTA. And you are not LENDING  you are GIVING it to them, as they don't pay you back!  Ask yourself if you are in a position to gift a significant amount of money, because that's what they really want. Ignore the \"lending\" bit, it a lie. \n\nFriendship doesn't mean rolling over and complying with every demand. If its conditional on that, you are not friends.", "NTA. Nope. Even if you have no history with him, it\u2019s also not a good idea to lend. \nBut now that you know of his track record, it\u2019s even a bigger NO.", "I only \u201clend\u201d out what I\u2019m willing to lose. NTA. You will never see that money again!", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, you don't need to justify not lending money to a friend. If you say no, it's no. They have no business getting disappointed or frustrated.\n\nSecondly, they've never paid you back when you've lent them money in the past. Why should you risk it again ? And with a significant amount too.\n\nThey're adults, they need to better manage their finances.", "Even if you lend him money under contract, you will have to take him to Court if he refuses to repay you and even if the Court rules in your favour  it won't make a difference if he has no  money to pay you back", "*Les bons comptes font les bons amis* - Aristotle\n\nNTA.", "There's an old joke that a friend isn't someone you use and then discard, it's someone you use over and over again.\n\nYour friend seems to treat you like a spare wallet, NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu would never get the money back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Should I have put our friendship above my own financial concerns,\" .. HE certainly does NOT.", "NTA. If you can\u2019t afford it, don\u2019t do it. \n\nThe way you should always approach lending money to friends and family is just accept you\u2019ll never get it back. Don\u2019t ever count on getting back. If you do, it\u2019s great! But don\u2019t ever count on it. So the issue of the friend re-paying you is sorta weird. \n\nAnd the flip side to this is being honest that you cannot afford to part with that kind of money.", "Im sure you've heard this before,  but never lend money to a friend. You'll lose both. Alex is not your responsibility.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure it would be a different story if you had had previous loans paid back, if Alex is frustrated, they need to look a bit closer to home as to why. \n\nI\u2019ve lent money to friends in the past, nothing outrageous but I always say to them I\u2019ll lend you money if I can afford it, I don\u2019t care whether you spend it on essentials or hookers and blow, so long as you pay me back. If you don\u2019t pay me back we\u2019re not friends anymore.

Now he needs large sum of money and I declined. Now, I feel bad.\"\n\nYTA for even asking this question here...", "NTA\n\nyou loaned him money once and he didn't repay it. Why will this time be any different?\n\nHe is in this mess again it seems due to poor financial management. He will not learn better financial management by being given loans he fails to repay.", "NTA.\n\nThey didn't paid before, highly unlikely that they'll pay now.", "Nta. Never loan money to friends, just gift them a smaller amount you are okay with losing.", "NTA,\nIf this is a cycle he goes through its time for him to learn. It's hard to watch but their not helping themselves and you giving them free money doesn't help either.\n When I hit hard times I get another job before everything gets out of control.", "NTA\n\nIt's only a loan if you can expect to be paid back. He hasn't paid you back in the past, so he's not asking for a loan he's asking for a handout, he just thinks he'll have better success if he calls it a loan.\n\nHow long does a friendship last when someone's a mooch? Eventually it'll end, the only question is how much money you'll be out before it does.", " I consider it a gift and write the money off.", "Hey mate, you got R200 I might borrow, to buy some bolting from Pick n Pay?\n\nI promise I won\u2019t pay you back.  \ud83d\ude00"]}
