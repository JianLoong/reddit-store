Even if it\u2019s just a snack at the gas station.\u201d", "NTA \n\nIm not sure I ever order food just for myself if two of us are home", " NTA. I\u2019d divorce my wife if she did this.", "NTA. He\u2019s being a jerk.", "> I would never order food to be delivered without asking him. He thinks I am just overreacting.\n\nSo do it. For a week straight, his favourite food and drinks, without asking him and if he says anything just remind him, there's nothing to it.", "NTA that\u2019s just weird of him", "NTA. My bf and I both WFH and whenever we want to do doordash we immediately ask if the other wants something. Your husband is being very rude.", "NTA, I mean come on, basic consideration is important! Who doesn't want a say in their own dinner?", "NTA!!! OMG it is shocking that you even had to ask reddit about this. Show your husband the responses and let him see that HE is a major AH", "Ew. My wife would never do this to me. Because she isn\u2019t a monster. What a jerk! \nNTA", "If you ever make dinner, only make it for yourself. NTA.", "NTA! I cannot fathom ever doing something like that with my wife.", "NTA. My husband: \u201cwow that\u2019s huge asshole behaviour.\u201d Honestly, asking is basic human decency.", "Exactly. Even if my husband doesn't answer, I'll usually get some extra chips for him.", "Agree! I\u2019m the one who does all the Door Dash ordering and I would never not ask him if he wants something even though he almost always declines.", "Right? I ask my wife if she needs anything when I\u2019m literally just walking into the kitchen to get something and visa versa\u2026every single time. I can\u2019t imagine not thinking of my spouse when I\u2019m ordering food for delivery.", "Well summarized! NTA", "And as she's repeatedly told him it bothers her he clearly just doesn't give a f*** about her. I don't believe she doesn't pass his mind. He either can't stand her or is so lazy and selfish he cba to ask her", "Yeah I grew up that way and so even when I had roommates I found myself asking if they wanted anything when I ordered food and she would often order a pizza with her boyfriend and just offer to share. It's not hard to be nice.", "Yeah, I shared an apartment with my brother for years and he would get fast food a few times a week on his way home and he almost never asked me lol. If there was a special pizza deal going on and he was getting delivery he might ask me if I wanted to add to his order and split the delivery fees. A few times when I had something come up at work (I work from home so it's more effort for me to go out and get food and I refuse to pay delivery fees lol) I would text him and ask if he would pick me something up if he happened to be grabbing food that evening. No expectations, just reaching out on the off chance. \n\nBut a spouse? Oh hell yeah, you better be getting food for both of us. I'm not married but if I was and we both worked from home, I would think we'd make lunch together anyway, so for one person to order in without thinking of the other is just completely rude. \n\nI feel like the default in a relationship is to have shared meals so I would always assume that if I wanted takeout, I should ask my spouse first, not only because they might want some, but because of money or maybe they already had the meal planned or something.", "Hell, I always ask my roommate if she wants to order something when I do, and she does the same for me.", "Literally came here to say this is roommate behavior, not spouse behavior", "Yeah honestly I was upset the one time my housemates did this to me whilst I was working. We were friends though.", "I had a guy I was in a ldr with do this when I was visiting him.. Between that and some odd behaviors that made me feel ignored and unwelcome in his home the relationship pretty much ended as soon as I got home.\n\n\n\nIt's weird too because over the years he's reached out wanting to get back together, but I just keep remembering that experience and I'm like... why though? \ud83e\udd23", "Gathering he learned his lesson \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Yes, that\u2019s what I thought - save on charges", "Before half our office was remote and more folks were about, I\u2019d usually ask if anyone wanted to hop on my order. I feel guilty *not* doing that even though it\u2019d be weird as I have zero people sitting near me. \n\nNTA. Your husband is rude OP.", "Yeah aggree with everyone here that it's thoughtless and rude, in particular to do to a spouse but the fact that she said it bothers her and he still does it is a bad sign for the overall relationship.", "100% or if he's not there when I'm ordering I'll add something I know he'd like.", "I'm wondering how he would feel if she made dinner for one from now on.  But yeah that's not a partner move. That's a single guy mentality.", "This looks is a exactly what I would do!  I\u2019d make his most favorite meals\u2026 for ONE!  It\u2019s petty, but I\u2019m really mad at her husband \ud83d\ude21", "This is the big question for me. My wife and I have a shared account that we contribute to every month, and we use that account for mortgage/groceries/maintenance/things purchased for the household.\n\nBut if I want to order some delivery and she doesn\u2019t want any, I use my account info to pay for it because the food is for me.\n\nSo the real question is\u2026 is this being paid for by shared money? Or does he buy food with HIS money and you expect him to just double up on an expensive order?\n\nIf that was the case, I can imagine he\u2019s getting sick of having to pay twice the price anytime he wants to order something specific.", "and they both waste more money you knew to online delivery orders fees are outrageous", "As a husband myself, I second your husband's statement.", "Not married but live with my partner. He agrees this is big asshole energy.", "My wife would kill me if I did this. Such a dick move.", "Same. If my husband is on a call and can't answer, my default is to get him chicken, chips and barbecue sauce. He'd do the same for me.", "My husband only does this when I am sleeping. I have insomnia and if I'm getting actual sleep I  prefer to stay that way.", "My husband and I both work from home. Lunch is definitely not a shared experience, as we don't always eat at the same time. He might get a break to eat at noon while I can't step away until 1:00 or whatever. \n\nHaving said that,  if one of us were ordering food we would check with the other to see if they want something too. We're too cheap to pay delivery fees twice.", "Whenever I've had a non-SO roommate, it was always a \"I'm ordering X, want anything?\" Or \"I'm gonna get fast food, want anything?\" Like, without fail, with multiple roommates in multiple States.\n\nLike... Cmon. It takes so little effort to be considerate in this case.", "In my last roommate situation I noticed that, when I did the dishes, I always washed anything he'd left on the side of the sink -- but he only ever washed his dishes and would leave my drinking glasses for me to wash the next time I did dishes. \n\nI say that to say this: I think that's pretty roommate-dependent. It's completely weird for spouses not to check in with each other, though. Particularly if one has said it bothers them.", "Right! Who doesn\u2019t want to split the delivery cost!? And so place won\u2019t deliver unless you\u2019re above a certain cost too.", "He sure did lol", "What is his reason for not even asking if you also want food\u2026?", "That food would taste so good . She had to make sure it\u2019s not enough to share , so can\u2019t be like a big pasta dish . Just a one and done . I bet the selfish husband would pitch a fit .", "What was his answer when you asked?", "Did she say they share finances?\n\nI can imagine a scenario where maybe they don\u2019t share finances or they have a joint account for household expenses but use their personal accounts for personal purchases.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Hubby is getting tired of having to finance his wife\u2019s takeout on a regular basis if she doesn\u2019t reciprocate.", "I don\u2019t have a husband, but if I did he\u2019d support your statement", "Third", "As a fellow husband (who often orders food), I approve your seconding of their husband\u2019s statement.", "Yeah, that's true, I was thinking about my own schedule, my lunch times are very flexible so I'd probably time them so we could eat together unless I had a meeting.", "Agreed. I've been happy to share orders with most roommates in the past, but a couple of my former roommates have habitually refused to pay me back for their order / split delivery fees, and eventually I stopped asking if they wanted anything lol", "Not a picky eater. Easy for me to order. In fact, I am less picky than him.", "it sounds like she reciprocate including him more then he does her", "OK, that's a third; the motion is carried. OPs husband is an asshole. I'd like to thank you all for coming to the council meeting today", "My imaginary husband (who looks exactly like Javier Bardem) agrees.", "Then NTA.  Ask him again to let you know when he orders, and that if you don't respond in \\[X\\] time if you're busy, he should order without you.\n\nIf he doesn't, either let it go, or think of some simple favor you usually do for him.  Don't do it, and when when he complains, explain: \"This is exactly how I feel when you order without asking me what I want.
