That is totally inconsiderate. My husband and I would never do that to each other. How selfish of him.", "NTA! That\u2019s a dick move. If you were just a random roommate then I could MAYBE see how he wouldn\u2019t think to ask, but even then it\u2019s rude.", "NTA. That\u2019s thoughtless as hell.", "NTA\n\nHe should at least mention it to you and check if you want anything, especially since you already brought it up to him.  I mean it's not a huge deal but he should at least ask.", "NTA come on Hubby do better!", "NTA. In a roommate situation this would fine but not when you live with a Spouse/Partner.", "NTA. My boyfriend did this once.....ONCE.", "NTA - he\u2019s being selfish. But if that\u2019s the way he wants it then just get your own food delivered from now on", "NTA. It's common courtesy to ask if anyone else wants food, especially your partner. \n\nHonestly, his behavior is not only baffling from sheer rudeness, but also expense. Isn't it a lot cheaper to only pay one delivery charge instead of multiple delivery charges (if he expects that you'll just order your own delivery?)", "Both of you working from home can be difficult, but in my opinion, this is a bit off.  You have told your husband that this practice bothers you, but he continues? People at offices often ask around when ordering out, why can't he do it for one (rather important) person?  NTA", "Every-time I pick up food or eat out anywhere I am expected to text in my family group chat to see if my parents or brother wants anything to eat. If I don't ask I generally get reamed out. It's a common courtesy to include others you live with on your food plans + why the hell is he paying extra doordash fees just to order alone. HUGE NTA", "That is a total asshole move.  I would be ashamed if I did that.  Time to fight fire with fire.  Start ordering some for yourself from his favorite place to eat and don't ask him.  When it shows up just throw your shoulders in the air and say, \"What?\"", "NTA\n\nIs he self-centered and a dick in other ways, too?", "NTA assuming there isn\u2019t some reason he is unable to leave his office or text you and take a few minutes to discuss placing a joint lunch order.", "NTA at all! But he is for not even asking. Heck, I ask my bf if he wants anything when he's not even home for the evening just in case he might want it when he gets home.", "NTA unless he used to ask and you would always say no so he stopped asking. Doesn\u2019t sound like this the case but that\u2019s the one situation I understand not asking.", "INFO.  Does he have a very narrow window in which to order and eat?  I work hybrid, and some days are so busy everything is scheduled down to 5 min blocks, exactly like a busy day in the office.  \n\nBe frank: are you sometimes a difficult, slow, chatty order-er?  Do you need lots of time, and want to talk over your options, and maybe discuss other important things since you're already talking?\n\nIf neither of these things are true, he's the AH: It's normal to ask your SO whether they want something when they order, ESPECIALLY after they've specifically asked you to.\n\nHowever, if for whatever reason you slow down the ordering process or are high-touch during working hours (not saying you are), I can see why he defaults to ordering for one.", "NTA but stop whining about it. Just don\u2019t order for him when you get takeout", "NAH.  I can see both sides. He's at work and feeding himself. You're an adult and able to feed yourself.  However, it wouldn't hurt him to just ask.", "NTA, but you probably need to communicate better. Instead of just calling it inconsiderate of him not reading your mind- he's working so there should be some expectation of \"work brain\" to separate work/life balance. You should just say \"Hey next time before you order can you ask me?\" Don't just hold a grudge or be petty and just start ordering without him. Use it as an opportunity to get on the same page.  Working from home together has its own stresses that drawing line may just help him cope through the  day.", "INFO - Has this happened more than once?\n\nIf yes, NTA and he is def a big AH.", "YTA. Order your own food, nothing is stopping you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You should also order your own food without asking him.", "NTA but maybe there is a reason he\u2019s not ordering for you? Like if his work pays for it. Mine does, if I work more than 10 hours in a day but they\u2019re very strict about sepending limits/quantities so that people won\u2019t abuse it by ordering for their whole family.", "NTA.

Do you need lots of time, and want to talk over your options, and maybe discuss other important things since you're already talking?\n\nYeah that would make all of the difference.  If he's just wanting to order a quick lunch burger and fries and she wants \"something\" but she's not sure what maybe...no not that, can we order chinese instead...  but maybe a Cobb salad from Panera and now his lunch break is over. NOT saying that's what's happening but it might be.", "No narrow window. He takes an hour and watches Frasier reruns.", "Obviously she's capable of feeding herself, but they're married. They share finances. They could both independently order their own lunch to be delivered and pay twice as much in delivery fees and tips.

Nope.", "I think that you will find that he is upset about not being asked . Time to make your point that he doesn't ask you.\n\nNTA", "No. He has his own company. No one gets food spending limits unless they are traveling.", "And the other thing?", "How often does this happen.  I noticed someone else asked about your ordering style/habits and you didn't answer.  Could it just be he wants a 5 Guys burger and doesn't want to have a discussion about ordering elsewhere or how much time you need to make a choice?   Are you hard line money splitters where getting an order together would involve moving money around?  When you talked to him before what was his \"logic\" in not checking with you?", "Then he\u2019s doubly TA", "She refuses to answer on the grounds it may tend to incriminate her, LOL."]}
