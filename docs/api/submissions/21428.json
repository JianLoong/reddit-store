So like the devoted husband who enjoys the tiniest of joys in life, I waited until one evening she had come back with Oreos and milk.

Boy was that a great night! I admit I\u2019m an ass but it was fun to watch her get all uncomfortable and stand up while saying \u201csorry what do you want?\u201d To which I replied \u201cnothing I\u2019m good but thanks for asking\u201d after I woke up in the ER (kidding.
