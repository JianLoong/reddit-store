Dont let your SIL ruin this special bound you created with MIL and how your husband is now happy and proud at the same time, emotionally and for your look.

When my mom passed, we daughters/DIL were able to each have some of her clothes. We gifted some to cousins as keepsakes. (They were sarees, so one size fits all.)

How is wearing someone's dress any worse than wearing someone's ring or necklace?\n3. I confess my first thought was that SIL was jealous, but my second thought is that seeing you in her mom's clothes might be painful for her, esp. right after her mom's passing. I suggest - for at least a few months - you avoid wearing MIL's clothing when you know you will see your SIL. (Her understandable grief still doesn't make you an AH for getting continued use and joy from wearing MIL's clothes, so please keep and continue wearing them, just maybe not around SIL.)\n4.

She later opened a Dress Agency. She spent a lot of her \u201cprime years\u201d touring Europe on holiday with her Gay Gang and never bought \u201crubbish\u201d. My daughter inherited all her clothes, etc and then did the house clearance. We have a lot of vintage high end clothes, furniture, hats, bags, sunglasses, parasols, scarves, spectacle frames - no receipts from when they are bought so we can\u2019t prove providence, but silk pillowcases, Dior cushion covers, Dior beach towels, Georgio Armani and Burberry parasols (can\u2019t see similar anywhere so no idea where she sourced them - possibly a promotional gift), hand carved walking sticks, silk sari (Mombas shop - so prior to the name change to Chennai).\n\nFor her funeral, she chose assorted vintage hats that she brought along to the crematorium, so that any of her friends could wear one in memorium.

When years later  we decided to give the 2 suktes away, my older sister gave them to her(upset cousin) daughter in law!
