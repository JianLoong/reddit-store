Nta. They're just clothes.", "NTA.\n\nSIL is in mourning. Perhaps avoid her for a while since she seems to be taking it out on you.\n\nBut if this isn't her normal way, then she's not herself at the moment, and hopefully will soon treat you with more dignity. \n\nBut she presumed too much in this. I can understand her reaction and I (personally) wouldn't have worn a dress (of MIL) to the actual funeral. But she didn't need to speak to you that way. As you said your husband is fine with it and you said your MIL wanted you to have her clothes.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with you wearing your MIL's things and this is done all the time. I would not wear them if the sight of them on you upset your husband, but this is not the case. Seeing you in them probably makes him smile and brings back happy memories.", "YTA. It is wonderful that you are wearing your MIL\u2019s clothes, however you look \u201cgreedy \u201c wearing them to her funeral", "Maybe don\u2019t wear her dead mother\u2019s clothes around her. I can admit that that would even make me feel some type of way especially to the funeral. Maybe after some time it won\u2019t bother her as much.

Your SIL is just being over sensitive which is sadly all too common after a death.", "NAH.  I'm sorry for your loss and sorry that your SIL wasn't gentler with you.  \n\n It could be difficult for your her to see her mother's clothes in use so soon after her passing. Give it some time and maybe avoid wearing them around your SIL for now. When someone passes, it's best to give each other some grace, even when you're technically in the right.", "NTA. SIL is in grief. She\u2019s not rational, and she\u2019s looking for someone to pick a fight with because processing her emotions is scary. You just happen to be an easy target. Which, in an odd way is a backhanded compliment- she clearly feels safe with you. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t excuse her shitty behaviour, but it does explain it. \n\nI\u2019d let it go for now. Give her some time. When you feel like she\u2019s stable, apologize for upsetting her, your husband was happy with it so you didn\u2019t consider how she may feel about it. You don\u2019t understand why it was triggering, but it was, and she doesn\u2019t have to justify it to you. \n\nChances are she\u2019ll apologize back for being a raging B and say she was overcome with grief and seeing you already going through mom\u2019s things really rubbed it in that she\u2019s gone\u2026or something like that. \n\nThen you can hug and make up. If she isn\u2019t receptive then you can rest easy knowing you tried, and whatever she\u2019s dealing with is hers to work through with her therapist.", "No. She wanted that and your hubs feels ok about it. SIL is jealous. Maybe upset her mum didn\u2019t say the same to her.", "NTA. Your husband approves so you\u2019re not tearing his heart out. You\u2019re actually bringing him comfort and wearing her dress to the funeral was honoring her. It\u2019s not weird. It\u2019s actually a wonderful thing you gave it a try!

She was far too young,  which I am sure adds to your grief. \n\nNAH- I simply cannot bring myself to name a grieving daughter an AH but she is wrong about it being weird. It might be weird and painful *for her* but it's not at all unusual. \n\nIt's lovely that your MiL encouraged you to enjoy her wardrobe and I'm glad you are doing so.  It's very normal when someone dies for some of their clothes to be worn by family members and some close friends (when my mom passed,  it was strangely comforting to give certain pieces to her friends and I know that when I wear one of her coats, she's happy to still be helping keep me warm & dry).\n\nI hope her clothes help you get a better sense of what you like and what suits you- it would be a wonderful legacy if she ended up making shopping for clothing less overwhelming & exhausting for you.", "NTA. It would be about like wearing clothes you got at Goodwill, just recycled clothes. Your MIL's clothes are not shrines to her, they are just clothes.", "NTA. JUST go low to no contact with toxic sil.\n\nAlso have you tried shopping online on sites where it easy to return the clothing?", "Many men don't care about clothes.\n\nOffer your SIL about half of the clothing if you feel that's appropriate. Otherwise, your MIL said she wanted you to have any of her clothing that you wanted.

But if it helps, you promise not to wear the dress to any family funerals.\n\nNTA", "NTA. They are probably high quality clothes so you look great in them. SIL is likely jealous. I think it is a beautiful tribute to your MIL that you are keeping her memory alive by wearing her clothes. She loves seeing you in her clothes as she watches over you from heaven. Wear them with pride and hold your head up high!", "NTA. \n\nYour MIL wanted you to have whatever clothes you wanted. Your husband is happy you're wearing them and feel confident.  Your husband *wanted* you to wear one of his mother's dresses to her funeral. \n\nNone of this is an issue or problem for any of the people actually involved. \n\nYour SIL has an issue and that's *her* problem. No one else's.", "NTA. Keep in mind that historically people had few, well-made clothes that were willed to someone upon their death. You're just following tradition\n\n\nA lot of modern people are weird about funerals, dead people's stuff. Etc. No worries on SIL.", "NTA. SIL is projecting her own discomfort onto your husband, hoping that you'd be more likely to agree to her demands if you think you're hurting your partner.\n\nHave a chat with your husband - tell him what SIL said, and have him confirm that he's happy with you wearing his mom's clothes. Then, tell your SIL to stick her opinion where the sun don't shine (this step is optional, she may just be lashing out in grief).", "This. I\u2019m better there is an issue with fitting in the clothes for SIL. Also unless her MIL had a fairly unique style I sincerely doubt the husband even notices most days if his wife is wearing one of his mom pieces of clothing. \n\nJewelry to me is always more closely tied to a person bc most jewelry is timeless, so worn by decades by the person who owns it, verse a few seasons for most outfits. I am betting SIL doesn\u2019t feel weird wearing her mom\u2019s jewelry, or insinuate her own husband must have some weird fetish for not having any issues with her wearing it. \n\nNTA.", "I'm betting that SIL can not fit into MIL's clothes and she is jealous of you having them.", "And just in case -- I really would invite SIL over, once things have calmed, and ask her if there are any pieces she wanted as a memento.\n\nIt could be there was a special dress or something among those clothes which she had a fond memory of her mother wearing, or something like that, or wanted to remember her by. Maybe not, but it won't hurt to ask.\n\nIf she snaps \"I'll take them all!\" or something like that, then she's not ready to discuss it, and I'd tactfully end that day and say let's talk about this another day, and walk her politely to the door. Or offer her something to drink (tea) to calm down.\n\nSorry for your family's loss.", "I always tell myself I will work on updating my closet but every time I try to go shopping I get too drained by all the options and when I actually go to try anything on I hate how I look in it", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
