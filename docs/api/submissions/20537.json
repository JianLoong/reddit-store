Might be good to give them a heads up.", "What good does anonymous reporting to you after you\u2019ve confronted him personally he\u2019s going to know it was you.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry if this 18-year-old kid can\u2019t figure out a way to make money without breaking the law, but you don\u2019t get to make your problems everybody else\u2019s problems. You don\u2019t get to do is destroy the environment just because you don\u2019t feel like going to work", "That\u2019s odd", "As someone in a specialist profession, I can imagine how well he'd take a grumpy neighbour showing up and \"telling him how to run a business\" lol. Fucks it got to do with them? Everyone needs to fucking relax, absolute wet wipes.", "Anyone encouraging snitch culture is brain dead", "What?\n\nYou think people breaking environmental laws for personal benefit should be applauded?", "We all share this planet, destroying it is everyone\u2019s business.", "I would mail him an anonymous letter from \"a concerned neighbor,\" explaining that what he is doing is illegal and if he doesn't cease his operations that you will report him. Because you will still have to live near him and that won't be a comfortable situation if he knows you turned him into authorities. He may even retaliate.", "NOT like the rest of us. HE is breaking the law.", "You don\u2019t get to destroy the planet that everyone lives on just because you are trying to get by and think the rules don\u2019t apply to you.

I don\u2019t know bout y\u2019all but our IRS has strict laws about what YOU are doing and it\u2019s whole lot more illegal then water pollution.

You sound like an incel.", "Yeah you don\u2019t want to go confront him personally so that he knows who ratted him out. That would be the stupidest thing ever. the anonymous letter is smart though", "NTA but you will most likely be viewed as one.

The kid is for sure the problem here!", "But the kid is 18, and I know I was ignorant to what zoning laws apply to me at that age. I'd be willing to give them some grace.
