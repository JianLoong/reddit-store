If the kid can get his detailing business on the up and up, he can more easily expand from there.  \n\n\n\nIf I were OP, given that he said he's known this kid for 16 years, used to coach him, etc, I'd go over and have a friendly chat, and even offer to help him navigate on how to get everything on the up and up.  I don't mean work for free or whatever, but I'd certainly do my best to help point him in the right direction.  \n\n\n\nThe key is to be supportive and maybe plant the seed in their head that they're doing great, and could go on to even bigger if they wanted by opening up a proper shop/garage/business/whatever.  \n\n\n\n(And if I had the money, I'd maybe even offer to help get started, since it sounds like this kid might have what it takes to make a real good go of it in exchange for partial ownership/partnership/whatever.

Maybe address it, but don't make it a focal point.  If the kid seems receptive to it, or even seems like they're kinda ashamed of if because they normally try and do right by the environment, then maybe press it a bit further by discussing alternatives and mitigation steps until they can get everything running properly (such as using more environmental friendly soap, cleaners, etc)\n\n\n\nBasically, I'd stress the \"I'd hate to see all this hard work you've put into this end causing any issue or problems for ya down the road\" angle, as well as really pushing the notion of growing even further.
