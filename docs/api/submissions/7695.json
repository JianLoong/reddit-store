They've been best friends for over 30 years. He's always been a gossip, talking shit about their various acquaintances whenever they hung out.  I told her, \"If he's talking that way about your homies, makes you wonder what he says about you, huh?\"\n\nAnyway, before our wedding 15 years ago, I was under a lot of stress and I started smoking again.  My wife (then fiancee) was really upset and asked me to stop.  I said I would try.  I was doing my best, using patches, gum, etc, but I would still slip up on occasion.    \nA few weeks before our wedding, I was driving down the road and my phone rang.  It was my wife and she was livid.  Her friend 'Scott' was driving behind me and noticed that I was smoking. He called my wife immediately to rat me out.  Jennifer wouldn't talk to me for two days.\n\nFast forward to the wedding day.  Everything went fantastic! We had a great time.  A lot of the attendee's were staying at the same hotel.  \n\nAfter my wife and I returned to the hotel, I ducked outside to sneak a cigarette.  As I was standing there, who should sneak up...but Scott.  \"I see you,\" he sing-songed at me, presenting me with a shit eating grin.\n\nI pretended not to hear him, put out my cigarette and went back to my room.\n\nBy the time I got there (2 minutes) my wife was furious.  Scott had called her immediately to let her know that he had seen me smoking and she was waiting for me at the door when I returned.\n\nShe yelled at me for an hour and wouldn't speak to me afterward, telling me I had ruined our wedding night.  \n\nFlash forward 15 years.  Scott is marrying his partner, and my wife wants me to go to his wedding with her.  I absolutely refuse.  It's burned me for years that his need for drama ruined our wedding night.  He could have easily held onto his 'dirt' until the next day, but he couldn't wait to spread the news, upsetting his BFF.\n\nI have no desire to attend this guys wedding.  All I can think about his need to rat me out to my wife on our first night as husband and wife.  It still pisses me off.\n\nMy wife is upset at me and says that since I was the one lying (about my smoking) that I had no right to be upset with Scott, and that I need to get over it.  My argument back is I was addicted to cigarettes, and I was doing my best to stop.  Her friend took great glee in creating drama on her wedding night and relished the fact that he was creating trouble for me.\n\nI am holding firm.  \n\nAITA for refusing to attend the wedding of this person?", "created_utc": 1674086197, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fmk0w/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_wifes_bfs_wedding/", "score": 2090, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I doubt this will be the majority opinion, but I fucking despise people like Scott.\n\nIntentionally starting shit, shit talking, etc is such a huge character flaw compared to being stressed and sneaking off for a cigarette on your wedding. Even if you classified it as lying. \n\n Also your wife seems overly dramatic(which is why she and Scott are best friends I bet)... you smoking a cigarette ruined the wedding?!?", "Strictly on the question you asked, NTA. If you don't want to go you don't have to. \n\nBut lying and sneaking cigarettes is entirely on you, not him. Obviously it's a huge deal to her. If my partner was sneaking around doing something I considered nearly a deal breaker, I'd want my friends to tell me. His loyalty as a friend was to her, not to you or your secrecy.", "[removed]", "Honestly, didn't even read this.

He rats you out and she chews your ass for an hour? I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re an adult, and quitting smoking is hard.

My judgment depends on these answers.\n\nEdit: Ok, with your answers, I\u2019m going to say NTA (but you skated really close to the E S H line, especially smoking on your wedding night). Scott sounds like a drama king, and he just couldn\u2019t wait to disrupt your wife\u2019s happiness on her wedding day. What kind of BFF does that? A toxic one. Your wife also kinda sucks here for screaming at you every time he tattled. I could understand her wanting a strong discussion, but yelling for an hour on your wedding night?

I know about myself that I cannot be around cigarette smoke, therefore I will do anything to avoid being around it, including not dating people who smoke or have smoked. I don\u2019t have a verdict, but I just, if it matters to you that much then it matters to you that much *all* the time, not just some of the time.

If she still treats you like that every time she is upset... I would suggest couples therapy.", "ESH. Your wife and her best friend clearly love creating drama and overreacting to it. Those are very frustrating characteristics, and choosing not to turn it off even on your literal wedding day is super shitty. He knew what he was doing, she flew off the handle, that sucks.

Even if the way he did it sucks - a lot - the core of it is not a wrong thing to do, and YOU were the one doing something you swore you weren\u2019t doing.

I get why you don't like the guy who clearly is a gossip and shit stirrer. But I'm sensing a lot of immaturity in your post. You are responsible for your action of smoking when you knew it could ruin your wedding night. You knew the hotel was crawling with wedding guests who could spill the beans, even accidentally, to your wife. Hell, your wife could have stepped outside and seen you herself. That's on you.

You because you shouldn\u2019t have lied and tried to hide it, and also for holding grudges for 15 years! Were you waiting for his wedding to pull this petty thing? But anyway, it\u2019s your choice.

I wouldn't go to the wedding, either.\n\nAs for your wife and the smoking stuff, well... Smoking is an addiction. You can say you are quitting an addiction and have lapses. You can be quitting an addiction by slowly phasing it out. What your wife was clearly wanting was for you to go immediately cold turkey, which can actually be more harmful when quitting an addiction of this sort. It can also lead to much bigger relapses in the future than if you quit by phasing it out. And if that is how your wife reacts to finding out about you having a cigarette, then no wonder you tried to be sneaky.\n\nI think Scott needs to mind his fucking business, and your wife needs to be more understanding of how difficult and stressful quitting an addiction can be. Not the asshole.", "YTA. You are letting him create even more drama for you. Just go as her plus one and enjoy a free meal at his expense.

Yelling at you? \nI wouldn't want to go to the wedding of a guy I have a grudge against either. Your issues as a couple wasn't any of his business.

However, you are in this committed relationship with her. If it were you alone, I'd say you can absolutely skip out. Since it is your life partner's bf, I feel you should go to support her. Tbh, that dude's gonna be so busy, you probably won't have to see him that much.", "YTA. You were being dishonest to her, and you're mad because he exposed you. It sounds like you still can't take responsibility for that. He shouldn't have said anything on your wedding day, I agree with that. But it's been 15 YEARS. \n\nIt sounds like you going to the wedding means a lot to her. Maybe that should mean more to you than a pretty minor grievance that's a decade and a half old. If you go, you'll probably barely have to interact with him.", "YTA, as this refusal is based on you blaming him for having to face the consequences of your own actions. Take some responsibility for yourself.", "YTA.

How your wife reacted (which sounds like it was addressed in therapy, good for both of you because it wasn't okay.)\n2. You trying to lie, sneak, and hide things you knew would upset your wife, and still to this day blame someone else for ruining your wedding night. Scott would have had nothing to report if you weren't trying to hide and lie. And from your comments it comes across like you still mainly blame him. \n\nYou need to get over yourself a little here. He's important to your wife. He isn't going away even if he moved, it sounds like they are still important to each other. You don't have to like him.

They've been best friends for over 30 years. He's always been a gossip, talking shit about their various acquaintances whenever they hung out.  I told her, \"If he's talking that way about your homies, makes you wonder what he says about you, huh?\"\n\nAnyway, before our wedding 15 years ago, I was under a lot of stress and I started smoking again.  My wife (then fiancee) was really upset and asked me to stop.  I said I would try.  I was doing my best, using patches, gum, etc, but I would still slip up on occasion.    \nA few weeks before our wedding, I was driving down the road and my phone rang.  It was my wife and she was livid.  Her friend 'Scott' was driving behind me and noticed that I was smoking. He called my wife immediately to rat me out.  Jennifer wouldn't talk to me for two days.\n\nFast forward to the wedding day.  Everything went fantastic! We had a great time.  A lot of the attendee's were staying at the same hotel.  \n\nAfter my wife and I returned to the hotel, I ducked outside to sneak a cigarette.  As I was standing there, who should sneak up...but Scott.  \"I see you,\" he sing-songed at me, presenting me with a shit eating grin.\n\nI pretended not to hear him, put out my cigarette and went back to my room.\n\nBy the time I got there (2 minutes) my wife was furious.

Scott is marrying his partner, and my wife wants me to go to his wedding with her.  I absolutely refuse.  It's burned me for years that his need for drama ruined our wedding night.  He could have easily held onto his 'dirt' until the next day, but he couldn't wait to spread the news, upsetting his BFF.\n\nI have no desire to attend this guys wedding.  All I can think about his need to rat me out to my wife on our first night as husband and wife.  It still pisses me off.\n\nMy wife is upset at me and says that since I was the one lying (about my smoking) that I had no right to be upset with Scott, and that I need to get over it.  My argument back is I was addicted to cigarettes, and I was doing my best to stop.  Her friend took great glee in creating drama on her wedding night and relished the fact that he was creating trouble for me.\n\nI am holding firm.  \n\nAITA for refusing to attend the wedding of this person?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Scott sounds like he thrives on drama, yes, but I suspect he was probably very unhappy that you replaced him as the most important person in your wife's life. Even if he was never romantically interested, going from an intense close friendship to being the second-best can be a very painful experience for some codependent BFFs, so he probably did take great joy in getting you in trouble with the wife.

I wonder what would have happened if, when you came back after smoking, she smelled the smoke on your clothes, hair &/or breath? This could have happened. Would she have reacted as dramatically? It\u2019s just a thought experiment. He should have approached you & said if you don\u2019t tell her I will. Then you could have picked your moment. That would have been a more compassionate and considerate way to do this. Or, of course, he could have minded his own business. Does he get how sad your first few days of married life were? Does your wife only blame you? I am a former smoker too & get how tough the battle is.

Finding out about it afterward stings a little, especially if there was an agreement. \n\nThis is coming from someone who has also had her own nicotine addiction.", "I think it was more about you breaking a promise on the first day you became husband and wife.", "Dude, I got news for you as non-smokers we can tell when you guys have been smoking even if you think you\u2019ve taken every step to make sure that you think you don\u2019t smell like smoke or your breath doesn\u2019t stink she would\u2019ve known doesn\u2019t mean that her friend was right to rat you out at all.", "Dude! Wtf. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t found out I lied you would\u2019ve had no reason to be mad\u201d.\n\nWho wants to be married to someone who feels that way? Zero ownership of responsibility for being a straight up liar. I would never want to be married to someone who could lie to my face and feel right even after they were caught.\n\nThat tells me you could find a way to excuse cheating too. \u201cWe\u2019ll what\u2019s it to you? You never would\u2019ve been bothered if you never caught me with her? While lying to you?\u201d Fucking gross dude.\n\nAnd then to add on, like it\u2019s an okay reason or excuse , \u201cmy wife loves drama\u201d. Do you even like this women? Cuz I *know* you don\u2019t respect her.", "To each their own with smoking but nicotine literally is an addictive chemical so not a habit so that's incorrect.", "I\u2019d personally message him to let him know that if you have to attend, you will be hoping his wife spends his wedding night shouting at him.", "Especially once you see how aggressive and defensive people get about it", "I can see it stinging. I can't see how throwing a fit for an hour is a fitting response. Imagine if something bad had actually happened.", "And it seems a little too convenient that Scott \"caught\" OP smoking after the wedding. I say Scott was following OP to catch him at *something*.", "To be fair I wouldn't want to make out and fuck someone who reeks of cigarette smoke. Op is acting like his wife wouldn't have known he was smoking the minute his stinky butt walked through the door. The ruining the wedding night is about the fact that OP broke her trust only HOURS after saying their vows. I would have been upset too.", "If my partner smoked right before out wedding night it absolutly would have been ruined. I hate the smell and I am not physical able to sleep next to soneone who smells like cigarettes. I would not be able to kiss him or to be intemate. I would be disgusted and demand that he  takes a shower, changes clothes, put this clothes outside, brush his teath and stay away from me for 6 hours until the smell has gone from his lungs.\n\nIf you don't smoke the smell is very pungent. My parents smoked all their life and I know the smell well. Even if you don't smoke for 3 hours the smell is in your breath as your body still tries to get rid of the substances in your blood. I even started vomiting when I tried to kiss someone who smoked once.\n\nSo yes, he ruined the night by smoking. Most likely there was no sex or any other intimacy this night and she was angry about it.", ">I mean, alternatively: if you hadn\u2019t broken her trust on your wedding night, it would\u2019ve been fine.\n\ntells her hes TRYING to quit. proceeds to have a day where it doesn't go well and he has a smoke. how is that breaking trust. that means that from now on if you say you do something it should be done that instant right because you have now broken trust.", "She was not able to have sex at her wedding night, because her partner was smoking and smelled like an ash tray. Many people would be angry about this. This situation was not abput the health issues.", "Yeah, I would imagine it\u2019s less about the smoking and more about lying", "No, **_ALL_** smokers are assholes, full stop.", "Yeah and you can smell it if they just smoked lmao", "That's a good point. We traveled for ours, so sometimes I forget people stay that first night close to the wedding.", "On top of it, he seems to take some pleasure in driving this wedge between OP and his wife.", "Honestly asking.. even the people that like make out with you? I\u2019ve never kissed a smoker (it\u2019s a hard pass for me) so I genuinely am curious.", "I had a coworker who smoked and who go outside for a cigarette and come back in and rub hand sanitizer from bath and Bodyworks all over her arms and neck.", "She would have tasted it!", "Maybe schedule an appointment with them so you can explain to your wife in a neutral setting exactly why you don't want to go.  The therapist may validate your feelings to her.  Or help you get past yours.  \n\nHonestly, it almost sounds like he was low key stalking you to catch you doing something bad so he could tell on you.  He sounds like an awful human being.  And if he talks trash to her he is absolutely talking trash about her.  You have told her this is not a person you feel comfortable being around, and maybe with your therapist present she can finally understand that.", "If the friend had caught him banging someone else would you have wanted OP to wait until the next day? A boundary is a boundary and the wife deserved to know that he not only crossed it, but also was lying about it to her - and know then rather than before being intimate and then feeling like she was tricked the next day.", "I kinda think she was going to find out either way, given it was the wedding night...", "That\u2019s not taking accountability, that\u2019s you stating the obvious. No shit you\u2019re wrong.", "That is so true. I used to smoke for about 15 or so years and then I quit in 2007. later on, I dated a girl who smoked, and when we kissed it was like French kissing an ashtray.", "I\u2019m not exactly sure why but\u2026\u201ddo you open-mouth kiss any of those pple?\u201d  Made me chuckle!!  Thanks for that.", "absolutely agree. my boyfriend quit smoking a couple of months ago, but didnt do it cold turkey, instead smoking less and less until he was smoking a half a cig every couple of days. but i hate the smell of smoke with a passion, and when i got home in the evenings , if he had smoked in the morning, taken a shower since then, and put on perfume - i could still smell the residual smoke in his beard when we kissed. it was horrible", "Did you hit one every so often or were you a smoker? If you smoke one every 2-3 hours people smell it.", "Growing up, my friend's dad was a smoker. Wife nonsmoker and very anti-smoking. Dude was 'quitting' for years. I'll quit before we get married. Quit before our first kid is born. Quit before the second. Quit by the time the kids are in school l, out of school, etc etc. Dude probably still smokes. So yes, if someone does not want to be married to a smoker. . . They should not marry a smoker. Because who knows if they'll ever successfully quit.", "So all OP had to do was avoid his new wife for 30 minutes on their wedding day?\n\nSounds like a great wedding day and a great start to their marriage, avoiding each other. \ud83d\ude02", "I agree. My late husband was in the hospital & rehab for months & couldn't smoke. He started smoking again as soon as I got him home. The damn things eventually killed him & I was the one who had to make the decision to take him off life support 2 weeks before Christmas in 2017.", "Type 2 diabetes is a thing etc.", "I think the idea of the wife having anyone -- brother, father, sister, mother, friend, male or female -- tattle on OP to her when he smokes is creepy and invasive. It's not like OP was cheating on her. Smoking is extraordinarily difficult to quit and shaming someone for smoking is not helpful when they're genuinely trying to quit.", "I only smoked for a year and a half and the smell gets to me now, I get so nauseous! I can\u2019t believe I used to smell that way", "Hot take, I think the wife being such a drama queen, and her BFF being such a snake in the grass created circumstances that increased OP's stress and made smoking harder to quit. You don't make an addict less addicted by screaming at them repeatedly.", "Scott is the wife\u2019s best friend. His loyalty is to her, not OP. I get why OP is mad, but why did he ever assume Scott would cover for him in the first place?", "Sure, but how fair his wife\u2019s approach was or wasn\u2019t is something he should take up with his WIFE. It isn\u2019t Scott\u2019s problem or Scott\u2019s fault.", "I don't see how that's invasive or creepy. OP's literally doing it in public. It's not like Scott is going into his hotel room to see what's going on.\n\nHe's not shaming OP. He's just letting his friend, who he has a closer loyalty to, what's going on.\n\nAnd sure, smoking is difficult quit. I don't see how that changes anything here. Heroin is difficult to quit. Would Scott be an asshole if he reported to his best friend that her husband is shooting up even though heroin is addictive? Of course not. The addictiveness of the drug itself doesn't resolve this.", "I'm starting to think medium_buffalo_wings IS Scott.", "Yes, I HATE the smell of lavender! And a close relative is allergic to most scents. Yet smoking is what those who wear overpowering scents will complain of.", "I work in healthcare and we are now taught in CPR courses to not give mouth to mouth.\n\nif the appropriate equipment is available, absolutely. \n\notherwise, you resume chest compressions.", "You had me in the first half not gonna lie"]}
